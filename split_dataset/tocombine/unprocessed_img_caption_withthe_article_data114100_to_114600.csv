They Can't.,Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gaza-borders_n_5630811.html,,2014-07-31,"A picture taken from the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip shows the sun setting over the Palestinian coastl enclave on July 29, 2014.. The Israeli offensive, which began on July 8 to end Hamas rocket attacks on the Jewish state, has killed more than 1,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians according to the United Nations, while 56 lives have been lost on the Israeli side, all but three of them soldiers . AFP PHOTO / JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b46240000140a51a917.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As airstrikes have rained down on Gaza in recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes. Some received leaflets and phone calls from the Israeli army, urging them to evacuate ahead of fighting. Others simply feared that the airstrikes, tank shells and cross-fire might take their lives and those of their loved ones. Yet for many Gaza residents, there are few secure places left to seek shelter. In fact, many don't have the slightest chance of exiting the enclave.Here's why:OVER LANDThe only legal ways in and out of Gaza are through its official border crossings with Israel and Egypt. Gaza has little control over those crossings, and both of its neighbors have severely restricted the movement of people and goods across the borders because of security concerns.Israel controls the Erez border crossing in Gaza's north. Since Hamas was voted into power in Gaza in 2006, Israel only grants Gaza residents permission to cross in certain circumstances, usually for humanitarian reasons such as medical treatment. At the start of the current round of fighting, Israeli authorities did permit hundreds of Gazans holding foreign passports to leave the strip through the Erez crossing. While Hamas has no control over who will eventually be allowed into Israel, it can turn away those approaching the border from inside Gaza, as it did on several occasions this month. On July 15, the group closed the border ""because of constant Israeli shelling,"" though there were no reports of shelling at the time. Palestinians trying to cross for medical treatment were left stranded.The Kerem Shalom crossing, the main point of entry and exit for goods on the Israeli border, is also controlled by Israeli authorities. They limit what can be brought in and out of Gaza and prevent the import of goods they say can be used to build weapons or tunnels. This includes cement and steel, which are crucial elements needed for the construction of roads and houses. Israel also bars virtually all exports from Gaza. The Rafah crossing connects Gaza with Egypt. Since the ouster of Egypt's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, the new government has typically kept the crossing closed for goods as well as people. Even when the border is open, the right to pass is restricted to certain groups, such as medical patients and residents with foreign passports. ""Even for those, there’s a waiting list of 15,000 people, according to Hamas border authorities,"" the Associated Press notes. UNDER LANDGazans have created tunnels under both the Israeli and Egyptian borders that are used by militants and by smugglers who bring in goods from across the border. The tunnels on the Israeli side are currently one of the main targets of the Israeli army, as militants have used them to stage deadly attacks inside Israel. Egypt destroyed more than 150 tunnels on its border last year, arguing that Hamas used them to support Islamist militants on Egypt's Sinai peninsula. As the Associated Press explains, the destruction of the underground connection with Egypt was an economic disaster for Hamas, which levied taxes on the smuggled goods. Yet it also constituted a tragedy for many Gaza civilians, who relied on the tunnels for essential goods. OVER WATERIsrael controls Gaza’s coastal waters and restricts Palestinian boats from traveling farther than 6 nautical miles from the coast. During conflicts, this is often limited to 3 nautical miles. The sea blockade not only prevents boats from getting to and from Gaza, it also severely restricts fishing, once a thriving economic industry in the area. International activists have tried in the past to break the naval blockade by approaching Gaza by sea. The largest and most controversial effort came in 2010, when six ships carrying aid tried to travel from Turkey to the Gaza Strip. Clashes ensued when the Israeli Navy boarded the ships, leaving nine passengers dead and dozens of soldiers and activists injured. BY AIRIsrael also controls Gaza's airspace and does not allow access to and from Gaza via air travel.Leaving Gaza on a plane hasn’t always been impossible. In 1998, Gaza's Yasser Arafat International Airport opened for business after its construction had been stipulated in the 1995 Oslo agreements. Then President Bill Clinton even flew in for its official opening. However, Israel shut down the airport in 2000 after the outbreak of the second intifada. Today, the airport remains destroyed and deserted. Wikipedia"

By 1825, Providence had 1,414 free black men and four slaves. Premiere attempts blacks in RI made to improve themselves was by founding the African Union Society. It was established in Newport in 1780 with the aim of providing not only birth, marriage, and death certificates to its members, but also, vocational training.In 1808, this society merged with the African Benevolent Society to form a school for blacks in Newport. It was not till September 7, 1838, however, that Providence officials established two schools to be ""maintained exclusively for the instruction of Negro children."" The Old South Meeting School which had been established by Moses Brown was continued under the city's supervision whiles a new school on Pond Street was established in addition. The city of Newport followed suit by establishing a city school for black children in 1842. The opening of these schools were heralded as landmark progress; but of course, were segregated.It was not till after the Committee on Education resolved that segregation in schools was unconstitutional that The RI General Assembly officially desegregated public schools in RI on March 7, 1886. This was mainly due to the February 28, 1865 passionate appeal by Mr. Weeden, the 28th Constituency Representative in the RI State House, calling on equal treatment for blacks.In college matters, Brown University also began accepting blacks in the 1870s. The first known graduates were Inman Page and George Washington Milford, both class of 1877. Elizabeth Chace, a tireless supporter of slavery abolishment pointed out in in her book Anti-slavery Reminiscences that prior to the civil war, intelligent black students were denied admission to Brown College on the basis of race. Prior to the civil rights movements also, black enrollment at Brown had been very low.Participation in the Civil Rights Protests The March on Washington: ￼￼￼￼ Local participation started off with two busses leaving Providence at 10:30 pm on August 27, 1963. Simultaneously, two busses; one from Woonsocket, RI, and the other from Newport, RI, also departed. Other Rhode Islanders left via trains, planes, and cars. The busses from RI joined with busses departing other New England states so as to get to Washington in one accord. The 157 people on the buses that left Providence of the overall 400 estimated March on Washington participants from RI had in their possession boxes of lunch and first aid kits.Prior to this protest, there had been little job prospects for black people in RI. According to the Providence Journal, RI had only 3 black doctors and 3 black dentists. Many blacks had also not been able to patronize their services because their income was meagre (median income was $3500, 38% below the average income of their white counterparts).The first batch arrived in Washington at 7am on August 28, 1963. The climax of the days activities which was Dr. King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech had put the black struggle into words. Though this had been a peaceful demonstration, the ride back to RI was not met without an unfortunate incident. Sleep was interrupted on one of the buses miles north of Baltimore, MD, when a rock hurled at the bus shattered the windshield and caused a broken glass to cut to the right eye of Warwick resident, Sandra Scott. Fortunately, a nurse on the bus treated her and the rest of the journey was free of any sort of violence.The Protest in Selma, Alabama:This took place on March 21, 1965. Future president of the Providence NAACP, Clifford Montiero, was assigned to protect Dr. King. He had been a Providence police officer for almost three years by this time. At night, he together with a partner guarded Dr. King's trailer in Selma. On the D-day, participants were divided into small groups. Patricia, an RI natives group included her friend Avis Stone, Rabbi Rosen from Hillel House at Brown University, and Rev. Homer Tricket, a minister of the First Baptist Church in America in Providence. She remembered that though they were met with disapproval and racist remarks when they marched through the ""white community,"" Dr. King's speech had encouraged her to continue strive for equality. Post-Civil Rights Protests ￼￼ Change was not swift; Progress took time. Though Rhode Islanders were told at a Brown University civil rights forum that civil rights problems in the North were as bad as in the South, generally, they seemed very enthusiastic about improving conditions for their fellow black residents. For starters, Governor Chafee, father of current R.I. Governor, Lincoln Chafee, upon the recommendation of the RI Civil Rights Task Force, the leaders of the Providence NAACP and the R.I. Urban League, issued an executive order calling for an end to discrimination in RI. businesses in 1963. He also began talks with over 30 leaders from RI. businesses to form committees to promote equal job opportunities for blacks. James Williams, executive director of the R.I. Urban League acknowledged in 1964 that it was safe to say that the job market had opened markedly, particularly for skilled, educated, and experienced African-Americans. Programs like the ""Tension Prevention Program"" and others were also implemented by the Providence Human Relations Commission in collaboration with the Providence Police Department so as to prevent ""aggressive"" policemen from patrolling black neighborhoods. A ""10-point plan"" was also drafted by the Providence Human Relations also to enforce all the legislations that prohibited discrimination in housing.There were changes in educational structures too. On College Hill for instance, ""solid measures"" were put in place to increase the number black students admitted to Brown University on an annual basis. ""Citizens to Advance Negro Education,"" a group of about 40 blacks and whites who were either alumni, students, or faculty of the University of Rhode Island also inaugurated successful campaigns that encouraged blacks in South Kingstown to continue their education after high school to either a technical school, college, or university. It sponsored 8 children to take either college placements tests or additional testing so as to be better prepared to enroll in the University of Rhode Island. The Providence School Committee, also reluctantly began to provide special education services to the deprived black kids in Providence.In conclusion, though far from a post racial state, the participation of RI African- American in Civil Rights movements of the 60s availed to them better work opportunities, living conditions, and racial relations that even till today, is being enjoyed by all minorities.Special thanks to The John D.

Speaking slowly and clearly, and especially speaking slowly and clearly in a monotone, is the best way to throw someone's concentration off. And that's the technique that Federal Reserve Chair  Janet Yellen used this week in an attempt to throw Senator Elizabeth Warren off-balance during a financial hearing.What the Fed chair was attempting to bury was the fact that the Federal Reserve is struggling in its duty to audit disaster-contingency plans of major banks. Listen to Yellen's responses to Senator Warren's questions and you'll hear long multi-syllable words. She never missed the chance to use a complex phrase when a simpler one would have done just fine. She also used lengthy pauses, with a hint of ""I'll say this slowly so that you can all keep up."" What we were seeing was a double-bluff approach to slipping something past the audience. One part of the bluff used language designed to confuse, while the second attempted to make the audience feel dumb about not understanding.The technical term is ""skotison."" It comes from an ancient Greek word that means to darken something, or obscure, and it's a perfectly honorable part of a public speaker's weaponry. It's the same approach that you'll have heard described as -- ""If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit"", and it's the technique that delivered Donald Rumsfeld's immortal: ""known knowns... known unknowns... and unknown unknowns..."" By the time the press had finished disentangling Rumsfeld's syntax, Rumsfeld himself had invaded Iraq. Elizabeth Warren, however, responded to Yellen's statement in the only way that you can respond to a skotison -- she challenged it:""I'm sorry Chairman, I'm just a little bit confused....""The skotison strategy relies on the assumption that your opponent will be either too proud or too intimidated to admit to their confusion. Elizabeth Warren however, was neither, and happily stated that the Janet Yellen's argument had lost her completely. It's interesting to wonder what the effect might have been had the Washington press corps shown the same instincts at that Rumsfeld press conference.The more senior an individual, the more we should reasonably expect them to know how to make themselves clear. If therefore we find ourselves confused, there's a high probability that it's because the other party intended us to be so.It's one of the oldest rhetorical tricks in the book. If your opponent is using the skotison double bluff, then remember the tale of the emperor and their mythical new clothes. Simply stating ""I'm a little confused"" is all it takes to reveal that your opponent has no argument."
4,POLITICS,A Lot Of People In Mississippi Are Confused About The State's Education Standards,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-common-core-confusion_n_5638248.html,,2014-07-31,"Karima Hawkins of Jackson, foreground, holds a sign against Common Core, the State Standards Initiative that established a single set of educational standards for kindergarten through 12th grade in English language arts and mathematics, at the Capitol in Jackson, Miss., Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2014. Opponents of Common Core hope to convince legislators into ending the initiative. Lawmakers return to the Capitol for a three-month session this year. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d4226c410000962b817434.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been called a federal curriculum, the end of literature lessons, and even, here in Mississippi, a “Muslim takeover of schools.” The Common Core, a set of math and English language arts standards that spells out what skills students are expected to master in kindergarten through twelfth grade, will be rolled out in every Mississippi school this year.The new standards are not a curriculum; instead they set benchmarks for math and English achievement in each grade. In 2010, 45 states and Washington, D.C., adopted the standards, hoping they will increase rigor in earlier grades and then build a strong foundation for higher-level English and math courses. Since then, a handful of states have dropped them.The National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers jointly created the standards, which were written by experts across the country and released in 2010.Even so, there is huge confusion in Mississippi and nationwide about what the standards are, who created them, and how they are changing instruction. In June, Governor Phil Bryant called the Common Core “a failed program,” months before all school districts have fully transitioned to the standards.For years Mississippi has posted some of the lowest scores on national standardized tests. In 2010, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., that supports the Common Core, scrutinized how old state standards compared to it. While about 15 states had English standards that were the same as or better than the Common Core’s, Fordham concluded that Mississippi’s were far weaker. The report described the state’s English standards as “mysterious,” and among “the worst in the country.” It concluded that the Common Core standards are “significantly superior to what the Magnolia State has in place today.”Every few years, Mississippi revamps and updates its academic standards. In 2010, the state adopted the Common Core, which “saved the state time, money, and effort associated with creating our own standards that would not have been as rigorous,” according to Mississippi’s former interim superintendent of education, Lynn House. At the time, the state was using math standards from 2007, and English language arts standards from 2006.Individual districts have always chosen their own curricula to meet whatever standards were set, and that will still be the case with the Common Core.Alarmingly poor results by American students on international exams helped prompt the development of the Common Core standards. A decade ago, 44 percent of Singapore’s students scored “advanced” on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), while only 7 percent of American students did. American students had made progress since the 1990s, but the gains weren’t enough for them to catch up to many of their peers in countries like Japan, Russia, Singapore and South Korea.“We can quibble, or we can face the brutal truth that we’re being out-educated,” U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in 2010, when scores for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results were released and U.S. students once again fared poorly.Common Core is meant to correlate with the standards in high-performing countries like Singapore and Japan. A 2012 study by William H. Schmidt and Richard T. Houang, education researchers at Michigan State University, found that Common Core’s math standards seem to stack up. They include fewer topics for students to master each year, and the grade-levels for given topics also tended to match, according to the analysis.Common Core in the classroomIn Mississippi, many districts transitioned their youngest students several years ago to allow teachers and students to grapple with the more challenging standards without the pressure of standardized testing. Under the Common Core standards, students are learning more challenging content earlier. For example, Mississippi’s kindergarteners were expected to count to 20 under the old standards. Under Common Core, they must count to 100.The English standards emphasize reading non-fiction, and writing responses to questions using evidence from the text. In an interview last year, Vincent Segalini, director of English language arts for the Mississippi Department of Education, said that the state is “moving away from those worksheets into more critical thinking.”The math standards emphasize learning multiple methods of solving the same problem, and students are expected to explain the steps in a problem through writing. Students may spend more time learning multiplication, but may learn five ways to solve a multiplication problem, rather than memorizing times table or learning just one way.Some states, like New York, provided Common Core-aligned lesson plans to teachers, but Mississippi has largely left the transition to Common Core up to individual districts. Many of the state’s teachers have started from scratch, or used resources from other states.The testsStarting in 2015, students will take new, computerized exams that are aligned to the Common Core. Like the standards themselves, the tests are intended to demand more of students than the traditional paper and pencil tests. Instead of filling in bubbles on answer sheets, students will perform a variety of tasks, like dragging and dropping fractions on a number line and filling in graphs. They will also answer multiple-choice questions, and will have to type out their thinking in written responses, even on math exams.In the past few years, Mississippi’s districts have scrambled to ramp up technology and bandwidth for the new exams, in the midst of budget cuts and severe underfunding. The exams themselves are costly. According to projections provided by the state Office of Student Assessment last year, in 2015, Mississippi will spend about $2.7 million more on the new exams for grades three through eight than the state spent in 2012 to provide those grades with the old exams.The debateAlthough the majority of states adopted the standards four years ago, the Common Core has recently sparked extensive controversy. Opposition has arisen both from some conservative and Tea Party groups who fear a federal intrusion on education, and from some liberals critical of standardized testing. (It was a Tea Party member who derided the standards as “a Muslim takeover” of Mississippi schools.)In Mississippi last year, the state’s Senate Conservative Coalition sent a letter to the former state superintendent, Lynn J. House, questioning the rigor of the standards. Common Core does not include a full course of Algebra I until high school, for example; some critics say Algebra I is necessary earlier, to prepare students for more advanced classes before and during college.The Coalition also questioned the involvement of the federal government in their adoption. The U.S. Department of Education did not mandate adopting the standards, but did award more points to states in applications for Race to the Top money if they adopted “college and career ready standards.” Many states, like Mississippi chose to adopt Common Core as those standards instead of developing their own.In June, Gov. Bryant said that Common Core would be a topic of the next legislative session, which led many to question whether he would follow in Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s footsteps and withdraw from the standards. In the wake of Bryant’s comments, Mississippi’s current state superintendent of education, Carey Wright, said in a statement: “It is a gross mischaracterization to call the standards a ‘failed program’ when Mississippi and other states have yet to give the first test aligned to the standards. The state is still in the implementation phase, and to remove the standards now would be disheartening to the district and school leaders and teachers who have invested time and resources in this effort.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report and appeared in the Jackson Free Press."

The live after-show, After the Rose, typically gives that person the chance to express any regrets or otherwise say his piece and, more often than not, conclude by gracefully wishing the woman and her winning bachelor well. But this time around, the jilted suitor, Nick Viall, used the after-show to reveal to the millions-deep audience that he'd been especially hurt given that, well, Dorfman had slept with him not so long before telling him that he wasn't the one after all. ""Knowing how in love with you I was, if you weren't in love with me,"" he said to her, ""I'm just not sure why you made love with me.""Dorfman responded by calling Viall's revelation ""below the belt.""

What I am questioning is whether those who condemn Viall do so because they truly believe that Dorfman had the right to sleep with whomever she wants. Instead, I suspect what made people most uncomfortable wasn't Viall's revelation, but that it was a man who made it. The standard version of that story, after all -- the spurned partner who regrets having sex with someone who didn't feel the same way -- has as its victim the woman, and not the man. Try to picture this scenario with the genders reversed: If the heartbroken contestant were a female wanting to know how the guy who'd had sex with her -- knowing how strongly she felt about the act -- could do so when, it turned out, he was clearly in love with someone else, would she be accused of trying to ""slut-shame"" him? No. More likely, we'd sympathize with the woman here, too. Similarly, it's pretty unlikely that if Dorfman were a man, he'd have considered the revelation ""below the belt."" He probably wouldn't be embarrassed by it at all. And that's my point: If a man in her same position wouldn't have been embarrassed by it, why should Dorfman? If we're going to argue that Dorfman has the right to sleep with whomever she wants without shame, we can't react as if Viall was wrong to call her out on it. As for whether or not this conversation should have taken place in front of millions of people, well, that's irrelevant. These two opted to be on The Bachelorette, where a ""loser"" is inevitable and privacy is besides the point. In the real world, this would have been a private conversation between two people who perhaps once cared for one another."

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) dropped a new bill Thursday that would potentially eliminate thousands of dollars in student loan debt for adjunct professors.Citing that more than half of all faculty at public and non-profit colleges and universities in his home state of Illinois work on a part-time basis, Durbin said many adjuncts are currently ineligible for the federal student loan forgiveness program since they aren't employed on a full-time basis.""As their budgets have tightened, colleges and universities have become increasingly reliant upon part-time adjunct faculty who face low pay, few if any benefits, and minimal job security,"" Durbin said in a statement. ""The vast majority of these educators hold advanced degrees, and as a result, bear the heavy burden of student loan debt. It is only right that we expand their access to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a benefit already available to many of their full-time colleagues.""The program Durbin wants to open up for adjuncts is called the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Borrowers who pay 120 qualifying payments -- or 10 years of on time checks -- while working in government service or the non-profit sector, like at a university, are potentially eligible to have some or all of their federal student loans erased. Nationwide, colleges have indeed shifted toward using more adjunct faculty, and fewer full-time tenured professors. Adjuncts often earn around $25,000 annually without benefits.""As a part-time, temporary worker with a crushing amount of school debt, I know how important student debt reform is for ensuring education retains the promise of social mobility for both me and my fellow adjuncts and the students we teach,"" Marga Ryersbach, an adjunct who teaches in New York, said in a statement released by Adjunct Action, a group working to unionize part-time faculty. ""I'm pleased that Senator Durbin is working to make sure we have access to a program that helps correct the imbalances wrought by huge amounts of education debt."""

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy growing at a 3.0 percent rate in the second quarter after a previously reported 2.9 percent contraction.The economy grew 0.9 percent in the first half of this year and growth for 2014 as a whole could average above 2 percent. The first quarter contraction, which was mostly weather-related, was the largest in five years.Employment growth, which has exceeded 200,000 jobs in each of the last five months, and strong readings on the factory and services sectors from the Institute for Supply Management underpin the bullish expectations for the rest of the year.The government also published revisions to prior GDP data going back to 1999, which showed the economy performing much stronger in the second half of 2013 and for that year as a whole than previously reported.LITTLE POLICY IMPACTThe GDP data, which was released only hours before Federal Reserve officials conclude a two-day policy meeting, is unlikely to have much sway on monetary policy as the U.S. central bank has already dismissed the first-quarter contraction in output as a weather-related anomaly.Growth in the second quarter was driven mainly by consumer spending and a swing in business inventories.Consumer spending growth, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, accelerated at a 2.5 percent pace, as Americans bought long-lasting manufactured goods and spent a bit more on services. Consumer spending had braked to a 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter because of weak healthcare spending.Despite the pick-up in consumer spending, Americans saved more in the second quarter. The saving rate increased to 5.3 percent from 4.9 percent in the first quarter as incomes rose, which bodes well for future spending.Inventories contributed 1.66 percentage points to GDP growth after chopping off 1.16 points in the first quarter.The economy also received a boost from business investment, government spending and investment in home building.Trade, however, was a drag for a second consecutive quarter as some of the increase in domestic demand was met by a surge in imports. Domestic demand rose at a 2.8 percent pace, the fastest since the third quarter of 2011. It increased at a 0.7 percent pace in the first quarter.Solid demand underscores the economy's firming fundamentals.With demand firming, price pressures picked up a bit in the second quarter, a welcome development for Fed officials who have long worried about inflation being too low.A price index in the report rose at a 2.3 percent rate in the second quarter, the quickest in three years, after advancing at a 1.4 percent pace in the prior period.A core measure that strips out food and energy costs increased at a 2.0 percent pace, the fastest since the first quarter of 2012. It had increased at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)"
