0,PARENTING,What I Learned About Myself When My Daughter Cut Her Own Hair,"Mary Lauren Weimer, Contributor
Freelance writer and blogger, Sweetbitter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-my-daughter-cut-her-hair_us_5b9cae56e4b03a1dcc80d563,Seeing my own issues reflected in my daughter's eyes threw me for an emotional loop.,2013-01-08,Little girl's face with hands and smile. Close up soft portrait on nature. Shalllow DOF.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cae562200003000d955a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The day after Christmas, my 3-year-old took a pair of scissors to her hair. It wasn't difficult to imagine her methodology: first a small section on the side of her head, testing the cosmetology waters, then a confident chunk right in front, her way of saying, This is happening, guys. By the time she was done she'd managed to achieve a sort of aggressive bob, uneven in a kind of artistic way.She sulked downstairs, wisps of hair stuck to her cheeks, like a puppy who'd destroyed a leather loafer. ""Oh honey,"" I sighed. ""Where'd you find the scissors?""After the requisite safety talk, I asked why she'd done it.""I didn't like my bangs anymore,"" she told me, ""so I cut them.""If she'd been 20 years older, I would've poured her a glass of wine and said, ""Tell me about it, girlfriend.""There are moments in parenthood that cause your own life to flash before your eyes. For me, my daughter's simple explanation was one of them.I've struggled all my life to find peace with my hair. In kindergarten, my mother took me to the local beauty school for a trim, and before I knew it, my long brown hair was reduced to chin-length.""It's called a Dorothy Hammill,"" my mother told me through my tears. Never mind that it looked more like Velma from Scooby Doo.In middle school, I spent more time on my hair than my homework. Each morning, I rose early to heat up my curling iron, then methodically seared my bangs in sections before teasing and finally spraying it all with Rave. I remember that one day in eighth grade my effort was rewarded with the ultimate compliment from a cheerleader, whose hair volume was something of a legend. ""Your bangs look good,"" she said, cooly.By high school, I'd decided on a more natural look. It took all of ninth grade to make it through my bangs' awkward ""growing out"" stage, made worse by a cowlick that yielded to no bobby pin. I've survived other hair traumas: bad at-home dye jobs and regrettable perms; an unfortunate single dread lock and a period I refer to as ""The Scrunchie Years."" I've sported failed up-dos and French twists that made a statement: Mais, non. When I became a mother, I embraced my new mom hairstyle, also known as the ""Maternity Leave Topknot."" (I accessorized with baby snot and wayward Cheerios.)Now that I've settled into my mid-30s I've finally found peace with my hair. I'll admit to occasional bouts of ""bangxiety"" (Should I grow them out? Cut them? Why can't they look like Clay Aiken's circa 2010?) but most days, I'm satisfied with the locks God gave me. I've even made peace with my cowlick. However, seeing my own issues reflected in my daughter's eyes threw me for an emotional loop.This is, of course, about much more than hair. Will my 3-year-old face the same insecurities as I did? Will she evaluate the way the other ballet dancers' bodies looked in the studio mirrors like I did at 12? In high school, will she struggle with the shape of her nose or the acne that dots her skin? As a young professional woman, will she try desperately to hide her West Virginia accent?Like so much in parenting, it's impossible to predict. My hope for my daughter is this: that she won't let herself be defined by what our culture considers imperfect. That she learns to love the freckles that spill across her nose, and the things that make her the perfect combination of her father and me. I know she'll have insecurities of her own, but I hope she'll develop the skills to work through them.In my own life, it's been a long journey toward self-acceptance and I'll be honest: There are days I'm still tempted to take the proverbial scissors to my hair. For my daughter's sake, though, I'm choosing to focus on what I like about myself: my bright blue eyes, my sense of humor and alright, even my cowlick. (I can learn a thing or two about perseverance from it.)I owe it to my daughter to see the best in myself in the hope that she'll learn to do the same."

""Martha Stewart got the Q&A really going when she asked Marc who his favorite porn star is..."" stated a press release from WWD.While Stewart's admiration for Jacobs seems a little surprising, the truth is, the lifestyle guru has been a fan of his for a long time. Back in January 2011, Stewart wrote a blog citing Jacobs' store, BookMarc in New York City, as her favorite book shop. And in September 2008, she attended the designers Spring 2009 fashion show during New York Fashion Week.

Increase Your 401(k) Contribution Even if retirement feels like a long way off, it's crucial to start saving as early as possible because time is your biggest ally. And don't feel guilty about saving for yourself -- one of the biggest gifts that you can give your kids down the road is the ability to take care of yourself in those golden years. In less than 10 minutes, you can log into your 401(k) website and up your monthly contribution.2. Schedule 10-Minute Quiet Time Kids are basically the epitome of noise, but taking time out is critical for your own mental health, personal well-being and general effectiveness as a parent. Plus, clearing your head can help you refocus on everything from your work to your finances. Take 10 minutes -- with the door closed -- to spend in total silence. Ask your partner to take care of the kids or, if they're slightly older, tell them it's a ""quiet game"" and offer something if they ""win.""RELATED: Why It's Important for Parents to Splurge on Themselves3. Do a Quick Project to Teach Money Skills Art projects don't need to be overly involved or messy to be fun and educational. If you have younger children, talk about how money works and the value of currency by having them draw and color their own dollar bills. You can even cut out a small headshot of your child and paste it in the middle, like the presidents on dollar bills.4. Open a 529 Saving for college can be daunting, but it's also important because expenses are rising. (Check out saving for college 101.) Rather than get intimidated by the whole process, start with the first step: Open a 529 college savings account. You should be able to open the account online, and it should be a quick process -- as long as you have all of your family's personal info at your disposal, like Social Security Numbers and dates of birth.5. Settle on a Money Motivation for the Entire Family This is a great opportunity to talk to kids about your finances -- without causing any worry. Explain that, as a family, you have a budget and it's important to stay within that budget. And if you succeed with sticking to that budget at the end of each month, it's a cause worth celebrating. Decide together what the motivation prize will be, like a pizza night. A good side effect: It gives kids a reason to stop begging for random things because they're also responsible for helping to stay on budget.RELATED: 6 Secrets to Shedding Money Baggage From Your Parents6. Make Sure That You're Doing Allowance Right Each family's allowance structure is unique, but it's important to reassess every so often and make sure that your system grows with your child -- and your family as a whole. And never lose sight of the point of allowance, which is to teach your kid good financial habits. A good rule of thumb: One dollar per year of age, so an 8-year-old might get $8. Want more perspectives on how to make allowance effective? One writer told us why he thinks allowance is so often done wrong, and we spoke to an expert for tips on doing it right.7. Hold a Dance-Off 10 minutes. Your kids' favorite song. Maybe an old Halloween wig. Dance your pants off. Not only is this a fun, quick way to bond with the kids, but it's also a sneaky way to work a little exercise -- which, for your sake, happens to release endorphins. And that, of course, can help you focus on everything from your finances to getting that promotion at work.8. Review Your Credit Score Your credit rating is key to future goals, including taking out a mortgage or getting a loan to start your own business. Make sure you're on track, and that there are no reporting errors, by checking your credit score online.9. Create a Charity Box Get kids interested in saving and giving by creating a ""donation box."" It can be anything from an old shoebox to a glass jar, which kids can decorate with markers and glitter glue. From there, make it a tradition to drop all loose change in the charity box, and let your kids help you choose where to donate the funds.RELATED: How to Make Charity Fun for Kids10. Call Someone Back Whether it's the bank calling to confirm something about your account or you need to check the status of an invoice that you sent to an employer, phone calls are really, really easy to procrastinate on.

Not only does it mean a good amount of preplanning, but it also requires a trip to the grocery store and the chore of lugging tupperware around with you on your morning commute. (As if mornings weren't hard enough already.) But, if you were to have a nice vessel to transport your homemade lunch -- like these reusable waxed canvas lunch bags -- that burden may be lightened. We stumbled upon the reusable waxed canvas lunch bags at the Etsy store PegandAwl and we love their reference to the sad paper bag lunches of our youth (and some of our adulthood). While these bags are not as affordable as the paper variety -- costing roughly $44 before shipping -- they're definitely a lot more stylish and better for the environment.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

4,WELLNESS,8 Things to Let Go of in the New Year,"Karen Horneffer-Ginter, Contributor

Although there can be value in this approach to creating change, sometimes what we most need is just the opposite.",2013-01-08,New Year's resolutions written on pieces of paper and stuck to the table,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb1142400005000534c80.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Often, when we consider making a New Year's resolution, we think about adding new activities to our day-to-day lives -- doing more by getting stricter with ourselves. Although there can be value in this approach to creating change, sometimes what we most need is just the opposite. Here are eight resolutions to consider, all involving letting go of something that we might be better off without.A grudge:  It might feel like too much to repair certain relationships in our life, but why not start small by choosing a person for whom you hold a small grudge over a minor offense and consider setting it down. Even if you can't quite justify forgiveness, try out ""letting go"" as an experiment. You don't necessarily have to tell the person about your choice. What's more important is that you make this shift within yourself and notice how it affects your behavior, possibly leaving you with a lighter heart. An unrealistic self-expectation: Think of an unrealistic expectation you put on yourself -- maybe assuming you should always be patient or punctual or on top of everything. Consider what it would be like to give this up for the year, allowing yourself to be imperfect and having compassion for your humanness.An unhealthy food: Review the unhealthy foods that you eat and consider if there's one worth giving up. A ""good"" treat offers us levels of pleasure and enjoyment that make it worth its cost, yet other indulgences (if we're honest about them) don't even really taste that good, or they leave us feeling worse for having eaten them. What might you consider letting go of in this New Year? A type of rushing: While it might be too much to commit to never rushing, consider if there's a particular way in which you'd like to slow down in these next months. You may want to commit to not rushing while you're eating, driving or running errands. Possibly, your family wants to rethink the morning stress created by trying to do too much in too little time. You can even try something as simple as walking more slowly when you catch yourself not needing to move quickly from point A to point B.A negative influence: Consider if there's a source of news, a type of music, or a place you sometimes go that often leaves you feeling irritated or down. If you're able to avoid this influence, you might want to consider doing so. Sometimes we forget the choices we can make about what we're taking in through our senses. A limiting self-belief: Is there a belief you hold about what you can't do or who you can't be that you feel ready to shed? If you notice yourself thinking ""I could never..."" think again -- maybe this is an old, outlived belief that it's time to let go of.A form of multi-tasking: Notice if there's a daily task that you want to commit to bringing your full presence to. You might decide you want to simply eat lunch as opposed to working through lunch, or talk on the phone without attempting to simultaneously accomplish house chores, or play with your kids without responding to incoming texts or emails. By doing one thing at a time, we can restore a sense of calmness and sanity in our everyday life. A worry or fear: Pick one worry or fear to set down. It might help to write it down on a slip of paper and tuck this inside of a worry jar or box. You can also create a mini-ritual in which you first reflect on what this fear or worry most needs from you, and what it is about at a deeper level. You can then imagine handing it over to a higher power, God, or some other force that works for you. The key is to imagine what it would be like to move this worry outside of yourself, experiencing the feelings of freedom that come from letting it go.

5,TRAVEL,The Worst Behavior We've Ever Seen On An Airplane,"Elyse Pasquale, Contributor
Food And Travel Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-worst-behavior-weve-e_us_5b9cb0e4e4b03a1dcc80edd4,Think Duct Tape Guy was a rare case? Here's a worst-of-the-worst roundup of the airline industry's most infamous inebriates.,2013-01-08,"FILE- In this Sept 12, 2010 file picture, French actor Gerard Depardieu tests a glass of wine during a gastronomy fair in Duesseldorf, Germany. French actor Gerard Depardieu was unable to control his bladder ahead of a Paris-Dublin flight and urinated on himself aboard the plane, a passenger on the flight told French radio Wednesday Aug. 17, 2011.(AP Photo/ Roberto Pfeil/dapd, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb0e426000035007f9455.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three words: Duct Tape Guy. The now-infamous, awkward photo of an Icelandair passenger's drunken inflight incident is making the rounds all over the Internet. Multiple sources reported that on a flight Thursday from Reyjkavik to New York, a man became drunk and dangerously belligerent. The crew restrained him with the help of other passengers using plastic ties and duct tape. The resulting photo went viral.There must be something strange in the air -- literally -- this week. On Friday, just one day after the Icelandair affair, the culprit was a plastered American Eagle pilot who allegedly turned up for work smelling like Eau de Booze. He boarded the plane scheduled to fly from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to New York City's LaGuardia Airport and began performing standard preflight checks when he was apprehended by airport police, given a breathalyzer test and subsequently arrested.You can try and blame it on the post-holiday blues. Long lines at security, overbooked flights and the sometimes-tearful surrendering of oversized carry-ons are just a few contributing stress factors during the most hectic travel time of the year. But really, there's no excuse for abhorrent inflight behavior (think episodes of crotch-grabbing, job-quitting and futile in-flight attempts to open the exit door). Not only is this your fast track to federal prison, you'll most likely cause a ripple effect of flight delays and heightened security. No one likes drunks on a plane, so don't be Duct Tape Guy.Here's a worst-of-the-worst roundup of the airline industry's most infamous inebriates.The Erotic Dancer: (August 26, 2011) A woman on a BMI flight from Moscow to London got drunk enough to let her freak flag fly. Channeling her inner exhibitionist, the tipsy passenger performed a one-woman erotic dance show, fondling other passengers and removing their eyeglasses. The live in-flight entertainment only lasted 15 minutes before the aircraft turned around and returned to Russia.Crew Juice: (March 11, 2010) A DonbassAero flight from Simferopol to Kiev was boarded by police minutes before departure. According to Gadling, the flight attendants, the pilot and the flight engineer were arrested. For the record, that's the entire crew. Every last employee working the flight that morning had a blood alcohol level above .05%, more than two times the legal limit.The 50-Day Excuse (October 15, 2012) What would you do if the sleeping passenger next to you woke up and began to scream in a language you didn't understand? A Ukrainian man on a Delta Flight from Boston to Salt Lake City came to, shouting to his seatmate in Russian that the wing was on fire. As the plane landed, the man ran to the back and attempted to open an exit door. The Salt Lake Tribune reported he jammed the emergency exit, caused the inflatable slide to malfunction and badly damaged the airplane's fuselage. According to Heather Poole, flight attendant and best-selling author of Cruising Attitude, ""The emergency exit door is impossible to open at 35,000 feet, regardless of how badly someone might try to get out."" However, our panicked passenger flipped his lid -- and the door's lever -- after the plane had touched down. When questioned by federal agents, the traveler admitted he had been drunk for 50 straight days, saying, ""I never sobered up.""The Wifebeater (December 2006) In 2008, an unusual court case surfaced. The Telegraph reported that a man traveling with his wife from Osaka, Japan to San Francisco got wasted on Burgundy wine and found out the hard way that he's an angry drunk. As the couple proceeded through US immigrations, the man became irritable and slapped his wife across the face six times, prompting an arrest for domestic abuse. Claiming it wasn't his fault the couple sued United Airlines for ""negligently"" over-serving the wine that caused the man to abuse his wife.The Rule-Bender: (December 11, 2007)  Though he technically never made it onto the aircraft, one genius decided to outwit airport security. When stopped at a German airport checkpoint with liquids (in this case, a one liter bottle of vodka) the man refused to surrender his purchase or pay a checked bag fee. Instead, the would-be passenger stood in the security line and chugged the entire bottle of vodka. He was soon incapacitated and taken to a nearby hospital with severe alcohol poisoning.A Golden Summer (June-August, 2011) Between late June and mid-August of 2011, three separate passengers on three different airlines got drunk and relieved themselves anywhere but the lavatory. June 27th: an unknowing trendsetter on a Jetstar flight from Auckland to Singapore never located the lav. Instead, he let it all out in the aisle, splashing several passengers.August 11th: An 18-year old US ski team hopeful decided to get wasted before taking a Jet Blue flight from Portland, Oregon to New York City and miscounted the distance to the back of the plane when he turned and urinated on the leg of a sleeping 11-year old girl.August 17th: French actor Gerard Depardieu brought celebrity status to the summer trend. Allegedly, he was not drunk, but BBC News reported he repeatedly announced, ""Je veux pisser"" and used a seatmate's empty bottle until it overflowed onto the floor.The Charmer: (May 20, 2011) Wasted from weather delay boredom, a Delta passenger made the moves on his seatmate by falsely claiming he was a federal air marshal and in possession of gas canisters that could render the entire plane unconscious. He then began sparking a cigarette lighter by his wholly unimpressed seatmate's knees. With quick thinking, she turned him in to the cabin crew, who were equally unimpressed with his sloppy seductions, diverting the flight to Memphis.The Castaway: (June 29, 2005) Sometimes, enough is enough. A passenger flying from Manchester, UK to the Canary Island of Tenerife became belligerent after his drink service was cut short by the crew. He cursed at flight attendants and passengers until the pilot took action, diverting the aircraft to a tiny (3-by-10 mile) island in the West African nation of Cape Verde. The abusive passenger was booted from the plane into the hands of local authorities. The aircraft then took off, continuing on its original course.Fresh and Clean: (April 29, 2009) A woman on a United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to London used her fear of flying as an excuse to mix sleeping pills with several mini bottles of wine. After she was found with her feet up on the tray table kicking the seat in front of her, she was denied additional alcoholic beverages. This prompted the unruly passenger to remove a bottle of liquid soap from the lavatory and drink it at her seat. When flight attendants tried to subdue her into handcuffs, the passenger punched, kicked and snapped like a dog, attempting to bite a crewmember's leg. Once she sobered up, all she remembered of the flight was that she was unhappy about the quality of United's wine. (psst: it was soap!) The Telegraph reported that when she spoke with FBI agents, her explanation was: ""I sometimes do crazy things."""

(Jack Dempsey/AP Images for HBO)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c71aa2400005100533306.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently, a teacher told me she had been talking to parents about the importance of serving their children organic food at school. The parents adamantly disagreed. Their reason? ""We don't want our kids to be snobs.""Sadly, it's not the first time I have heard organic characterized as arrogant or elitist. The teacher's story reminded me of early last year, when Rick Santorum accused President Obama of being a ""snob"" for wanting everybody in America to go to college. I don't make that analogy to politicize this issue. The importance of eating healthy or bettering oneself through education should be priorities for everyone, no matter what their sex, race, economic status or political affiliation. Personally, I don't think Santorum believed what he said as much as he saw an opportunity to exploit a noble goal for political gain. Sadly, when things like this happen, we all suffer because important facts get distorted in service of other agendas.Still, it's hard to blame parents who are dubious about organic food when most people are still confused about what the term organic actually means and hundreds of millions of dollars are spent by Big Food on advertising and lobbysists to convince us that there is nothing wrong with the animals we eat being loaded up with antibiotics or the produce we eat being genetically modified or sprayed with harmful pesticides. Big companies spend all those dollars because it makes them a lot more. Why else did they commit so much to successfully defeating Prop 37 here in California, which simply called for transparency, requiring food companies to label their foods produced with genetically modified ingredients? One would think that voters would overwhelmingly demand that basic information like that be made readily available to them, however ""the survival of the current food system depends upon widespread ignorance of how it really operates"" and as a result, the issue became a major political hot button -- one that has unfortunately convinced many Americans that labeling and organic food are elements of an elitist liberal agenda.They're not. Choosing organic is simply making the choice to not ingest pesticides and increasingly, consumers from all walks of life agree it's a better way to go. A 2011 Thomson-Reuters-NPR poll showed that people highly prefer organic, finding no statistical difference between income brackets. Another study showed that people earning less than $30,000 a year and people with children purchased more organic products than higher earners and those without children. So while Big Food and Friends like to paint organic as snobbery, the research just doesn't support it.No matter what our political beliefs, we all need to pay closer attention to what we are feeding our children. Childhood obesity has tripled in the last 30 years; food dyes are believed to contribute to a whole host of health issues; artificial hormones in milk and dairy products have been under investigation because of potential links to early puberty and other health complications in girls. The list goes on.Fortunately, we have some brilliant people in both the public and private sectors leading the charge to educate the nation about the importance of eating right and fighting to change the way big food companies do business. First Lady Michelle Obama; Ken Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group; and Gary Hirshberg, co-founder of Stonyfield Farm, are just three of them, checking partisanship at the door, doing battle with special interest groups, enlightening people about the importance of good food, and in the process, protecting our children and reversing the preconceived notions many of us have about organic. We should all consider ourselves lucky to have them fighting on our behalf, because if the $46 million Big Food spent defeating Prop 37 proves anything to us it is that our well-being is for sale.If you think giving your kids organic isn't worth it, I simply urge you to base your decision on the best information available. Or, if you feel like going organic is overwhelming, start small. Maybe buy one organic item and build from there. Every positive step you take will make a difference to your health, your children's, and the health of our planet.And if you still aren't convinced about organic, just please don't call it snobbery."

I know that once I get my ""I love running, rowing, working out, and eating right"" engine going, I will love it; until then, the only thing I can do is fake it 'til I make it.It's the nutrition, stupid -- While it is true that calories in require calories out, the missing piece of my training regimen is the eating. I lost most of my weight two years ago while I was living in Portland, Ore., after I picked up and started following the Dukan diet, a diet that's pretty similar to the Atkins and Paleo diets: lots of lean protein and a variety of vegetables and no-fat foods. I was religious about this, even though my cardio and strength were nowhere comparable to my core fitness now, and the weight started melting off, which is why I initially bought my wireless Wi-Fi Withings scale -- in order to  live tweet my weight loss progress. So, I rededicate myself to getting religious about this part of the equation again. And, part of that success came from being very detailed in food logging. I use LoseIt to log my food, though I tend to stop logging after 6 p.m., when the cheating starts. No, I won't beat myself up over this, but I will work on prioritizing healthy eating and portion control as the foundation of a healthy life as opposed to working out. And getting all of that under control really demands a rigorous food log -- not a convenient one, but one that tracks everything whether or not it reflects well in the mirror.Get back onto my erg -- I rowed in college. I still maintain a gorgeous carbon fiber rowing shell down on the Potomac River that I am still too heavy to take back onto the water. And I own a Concept II Indoor Rower, something we called an erg, rowing ergometer, or coxswain torture device -- and for the last year, it's been a hanger. I know, that's so cliche. Now it's set up to be used. Not only that, but I resolve to compete on my indoor rower. I have teamed up with Stephen Dee, a dear friend and fellow rower from Toronto, and we're going to virtually compete this year on the Concept II log site. Our first competition is called the Virtual Team Challenge, and it starts today! The goal? As many meters rowed during the month of January. If you have access to an indoor rower, please feel free to join our open team, Team Grotto!Get back on the road -- Last spring, I had Mizuno Running as a client and have five pair of Mizuno running shoes. These are really great shoes, but they've become ""Gym Queens"" and don't spend any time on the road. And I plan to put them to good use -- on the road. No matter how slow I run or how often I break into a walk or even a sit down, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I put the time in. And I think that time should be an hour. And while I know I cannot run an hour, I know I can run for 10 or 15 minutes, anyway, and then walk the rest of the way. It's all mileage, right? It's all time on the road. When I run, I do track the runs on RunKeeper as well as my Garmin Forerunner 305 with heart rate monitor chest strap. Keeping good track of my activity is very motivational, and sharing all of that personal, intimate, information such as live tweeting my weight via my Withings Wi-Fi scale, tweeting all of my workouts and also taking photos to document the session via Instagram and Tumblr is also motivational for me.Get into road racing -- As an incentive to get back onto the road with a goal, I plan on getting into road racing, starting with 5k races and hopefully (easily) progressing to 10k races. I did it after I got injured in high school wrestling to keep fit, but I never kept up with it, no matter how many miles I logged when I used to jog every day. I don't aspire to win, but I think it would be a good habit to get into. I am not a very competitive fellow -- except with myself -- but I think that these races are pretty important to be used as goals. For example, I plan to register for the Capitol Hill Classic 10k run that's coming up on Sunday, May 19, 2013; however, I will be registering for some stuff in February, March, and April as well. I'd like to think I am not that far away from being able to run 10 kilometers, which is actually only 6.21371 miles. (Back in the day, I used to run 4 miles a day with 8-mile runs on the weekends, but it's been a while -- though, I don't need to win, I just need to finish.)Anyway, this is all pretty exciting (and I want to you to know, I am going for my first run right after I finish this blog post -- wish me luck! And be sure to let me know what you're doing and if you have any advice, motivational skills, or recommendations.For more by Chris Abraham, click here.For more on weight loss, click here. "
