All things food and drink",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-most-amazing-restaurant-bathrooms_us_5b9daa38e4b03a1dcc8b0fa4,Some of these restrooms very well might merit a visit to the restaurant just to have the opportunity to use it.,2013-11-17,"Alex Madonna's Gold Rush Steak House, San Luis Obispo, Calif.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9daa382100003100c59d40.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Restaurant bathrooms are a bit of a touchy subject. We've all visited them, and we all have our preferences. Some prefer single-person restrooms, even though they usually require a wait. Some prefer stalls with doors that close completely, so it's like you're in a little room. Some prefer automatic sinks and hand dryers, so they don't have to touch anything; others demand paper towels and consider using automatic dryers to be a waste of time. Still, others are content with even the most utilitarian of restrooms; we're not supposed to be hanging out in them, after all. Others forego them completely and just wait until they get home. But a small percentage of restaurants are going above and beyond in their restroom approach, and they deserve to be applauded. For that reason, we've rounded up the best restaurant restrooms in America.From a Zen-themed, spa-like women's room in Seattle to a Chicago bathroom that you enter by walking into a cylinder and turning the walls, there are some truly mind-blowing restaurant bathrooms out there, ones where upon returning to your table you have no option but to turn to your dining companions and say one of the oddest phrases you can utter at a table: ""You have to check out that bathroom!""Once upon a time, a fancy restaurant bathroom was sure to include a bathroom attendant, a steward who perched next to the sink at high-end restaurants. Ready to turn the faucet for you, hand you a paper towel , supply you with a spritz of cologne, and leave you awkwardly fumbling for a buck, today they're a dying breed, overtaken by the concept that, as adults, we're perfectly capable of fending for ourselves in the restroom.But the loss of the bathroom attendant isn't a sign of a lowering of restroom standards. At its core, a restaurant restroom should be an extension of the restaurant experience; nobody wants to leave their table in a finely appointed dining room only to encounter a dirty, dingy commode. While the restroom is an afterthought at the vast majority of restaurants, there are some whose restrooms very well might merit a visit to the restaurant just to have the opportunity to use it.Click Here to see The 10 Coolest McDonald's in the WorldIn order to rank these restrooms, we took a look at overall design, the ""coolness"" factor, uniqueness, the use of funky gizmos and gadgets (you'll see), and ease of use (a restroom can be stunning, but it's not so great if it takes five minutes to figure out how to flush the toilet). We sorted through plenty of online lists and boards, added some of our personal favorites, and after whittling them down we're confident that we've found the best.

Doesn't matter, this isn't going to surprise you.Facebook reaffirmed its position on Friday that it's able to use the postings and personal information of 1.2 billion accounts on the service for advertising purposes. The social media website announced the new privacy policies in a blog post on the site.Facebook initially included, then removed, a line about how minors who join the site needed a parent or guardian to give consent before they are used in ads. Facebook now says that this permission is granted once the teen signs up for the site. The changes were first proposed by Facebook in August, then drew the attention of the Federal Trade Commission after privacy groups complained in September that Facebook was exploiting minors. The changes followed Facebook's $20 million settlement in August of a class action lawsuit that claimed the company's ""Sponsored Stories"" platform had shared users' ""likes"" without paying them or allowing them to opt out. In 2011, Facebook and the FTC had reached a separate settlement over alleged privacy violations by the site. Facebook agreed to scheduled checkups by ""independent, third-party auditors"" over the next 20 years to ensure that the company's privacy policies and practices do not violate users' rights.In the blog post Friday explaining the policy, Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan said the sentence regarding minors did not grant the company any additional rights over user content. After receiving feedback, the company agreed ""that the language was confusing"" and ""removed the sentence."" Despite Facebook's clarification, many members of the site remain confused about their privacy options. In the August settlement, Facebook was ordered to implement provisions to make its user privacy policy more transparent. One part of the policy says the company will give parents the chance to prevent their children's information from being used in ads, and that the site will let users know if any comments they made on the site were turned into a ""Sponsored Stories"" ad, giving them the chance to opt out.“The innovative controls we agreed to in connection with the settlement take time to build,” Jodi Seth, a Facebook spokeswoman told The New York Times in a Friday story. She offered no timetable for introducing them. "

They thanked her for giving those who lived the Balkan war a chance to express themselves.The 38-year-old Oscar winner is a special envoy to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and has made more than 40 field missions, including recently to help refugees fleeing the war in Syria.Upon receiving the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from director George Lucas, Jolie remembered her late mother who encouraged her to live a life of use to others, although the actress said it took time for her to realize what that meant.""When I met survivors of war and famine and rape, I learned what life is like for most people in this world,"" Jolie said.""I realized how sheltered I had been,"" she added, ""and I was determined to never be that way again.""Past winners of the humanitarian award include Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman.

Bill 2491, which passed a County Council vote on Oct. 16, will force agricultural companies to disclose when and where they spray pesticides, restrict spraying to a certain distance away from public areas, and disclose what genetically engineered crops they grow on Kauai.Mayor Carvalho vetoed the bill two weeks after its passage, citing concerns over its legal standing. In a press release he said, “I have always said I agree with the intent of this bill to provide for pesticide use disclosure, create meaningful buffer zones and conduct a study on the health and environmental issues relating to pesticide use on Kauai. However, I believe strongly that this bill is legally flawed. That being the case, I had no choice but to veto.”Supporters of the bill and many members of the County Council were outraged. When Carvalho appeared before the public, jeers and calls for his resignation emanated from the crowd. The County Council could override the veto with five votes, but when it came time for the vote this Thursday, it was not clear they would have a fifth supporter. The Council elected to delay the vote so they could appoint a seventh council member. Yesterday the Council appointed Mason Chock to replace Nadine Nakamura, who had left the Council, ironically, to become Mayor Carvalho’s managing director. Today the Council voted to override the veto by a count of 5-2. Mayor Carvalho left before the vote took place.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Mayor Carvalho sat through the vote. "
