Krugman and Niall Ferguson, author of 'The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World,' clashed anew today over how to revive the U.S. economy.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist wrote in blog posts Saturday and Sunday that rising social inequality makes it less likely for children born into poor families to earn more money later in life. Krugman illustrates this point with a chart from Miles Corak, an economics professor at the University of Ottawa, that shows a widening gap between how much money the rich and poor spend on their children. Earlier this month, Mankiw wrote that the top 1 percent of society is richer because they contribute more to society and in essence earn more as a result. But, as Krugman points out, the former economic adviser to President George W. Bush fails to acknowledge how much society has changed in the last 50 years and how those changes lead to differing opportunities for children, depending on the family into which they are born. ""It was a different country, one in which ordinary public high schools were often pretty good, in which good higher education was available cheaply at state universities, in which almost none of the vast apparatus of tutors and private instruction now used by the elite existed,"" Krugman wrote, referring to how America has changed since 1958, when Mankiw was born. Indeed, as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger illustrated with the concept of the ""Great Gatsby Curve,"" high inequality is associated with low economic mobility. This problem only appears to be getting worse as income inequality in America continues to grow. Between 1966 and 2011, the incomes of the bottom 90 percent grew by an average of merely $59 after adjusting for inflation, according to an analysis by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston for Tax Analysts. This compares to an average increase in income of $116,071 experienced by the top 10 percent during the same period. As Krugman notes, he is not the first to take aim at Mankiw's defense of the richest members of society. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, points out that even if the top 1 percent deserve to earn more because of their contributions to society, policy plays a large role in deciding how much they are rewarded for those contributions.

The official tracklist to the rapper's album only lists one collaborator: ""God,"" a feature on West's song ""I Am A God."" West's crediting of God on the album left some listeners confused and others offended. Now, a member of Christian band Stryper is weighing in. Michael Sweet, frontman of the metal band, spoke to TMZ about West's tracklisting for ""I Am A God,"" evaluating the 36-year-old rapper's intent. ""When you believe in God, you want Him to be a part of everything you do, guiding you through the entire process,"" Sweet told TMZ. ""So, I understand what is meant."" West recently came under fire for another song off of his ""Yeezus"" album. In a track called ""On Sight,"" West raps, ""A monster about to come alive again / Soon as I pull up and park the Benz / We get this b— shaking like Parkinson's."" The American Parkinson Disease Association took issue with the song, calling the lyrics ""distasteful and the product of obvious ignorance."" "

Schools were also ordered to close in one district in Pahang state.All domestic airports managed by Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) are operating as usual despite the haze, the national news agency quoted the airport operator as saying.The current visibility level of 1 km was still safe, but runways would have to close if visibility fell under 300 m, it quoted Malaysian airports official Azmi Murad as saying.Indonesian officials have deflected blame by suggesting companies based in Malaysia and Singapore may be partly responsible.
