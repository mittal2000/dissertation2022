You could have given me that ""smile"" that I despise because it means; ""manage your child please."" You did none of that.",2014-01-13,1 In 68 Children Are Identified As Having Autism Spectrum Disorder ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a66cf81200002c00134a47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Dear ""Daddy,""I don't know your name, but Kate called you ""daddy"" for the entire flight last week and you kindly never corrected her. In fact, you didn't even flinch as you could probably tell that she was not confusing you with her own ""daddy,"" but instead making a judgment regarding your level of ""safety"" for her. If she calls you ""daddy"" then you better believe she thinks you are alright. I sat Kate, my 3-year-old who has autism, in the middle seat knowing full well that there would be a stranger sitting next to her for the duration of this flight. I had to make a quick decision and based on her obsession with opening and closing the window shade, I figured she might be less of a distraction if she sat in the middle. I watched the entire Temple basketball team board the plane, and wondered if one of these giants might sit by Kate. They all moved toward the back. She would have liked that, she would have made some observations that I would have had to deal with, but she would have liked those players. I watched many Grandmotherly women board and hoped for one to take the seat but they walked on by. For a fleeting moment I thought we might have a free seat beside us, and then you walked up and sat down with your briefcase and your important documents and I had a vision of Kate pouring her water all over your multi-million dollar contracts, or house deeds, or whatever it was you held. The moment you sat down, Kate started to rub your arm. Your jacket was soft and she liked the feel of it. You smiled at her and she said: ""Hi, Daddy, that's my mom."" Then she had you.You could have shifted uncomfortably in your seat. You could have ignored her. You could have given me that ""smile"" that I despise because it means; ""manage your child please."" You did none of that. You engaged Kate in conversation and you asked her questions about her turtles. She could never really answer your questions but she was so enamored with you that she kept eye contact and joint attention on the items you were asking her about. I watched and smiled. I made a few polite offers to distract her, but you would have none of it. Kate: (Upon noticing you had an iPad) Is dis Daddy's puduter? You: This is my iPad. Would you like to see it?Kate: To me?????? (I know she thought you were offering it to her to keep)Me: Look with your eyes, Kate. That is not yours.Kate: Dat's nice!You: (Upon noticing that Kate had an iPad) I like your computer, too. It has a nice purple case. Kate: Daddy wanna be a bad guy? (She offered shredder to you and that, my friend, is high praise)You: Cool. The interaction went on and on and you never once seemed annoyed. She gave you some moments of peace while she played with her Anna and Elsa dolls. Kind of her to save you from playing Barbies, but I bet you wouldn't have minded a bit. I bet you have little girls, too. Not long before we landed Kate had reached her limit. She screamed to have her seatbelt off, she screamed for me to open the plane door and she cried repeating, ""Plane is cwosed (closed)"" over and over. You tried to redirect her attention to her toys. She was already too far gone at this point, but the fact that you tried to help your new little friend made me emotional. In case you are wondering, she was fine the moment we stepped off the plane. Thank you for letting us go ahead of you. She was feeling overwhelmed and escaping the plane and a big, long hug was all she needed. So, thank you. Thank you for not making me repeat those awful apologetic sentences that I so often say in public. Thank you for entertaining Kate so much that she had her most successful plane ride, yet. And, thank you for putting your papers away and playing turtles with our girl.This post originally appeared on Go Team Kate. Also on HuffPost:"

Some will",2014-01-13,"In this photo provided by the Vatican paper L' Osservatore Romano, Pope Francis blesses a baby during a baptism at the Vatican, Sunday, Jan. 12, 2014. With wails resounding amid the splendor of the Sistine Chapel, the Pontiff baptized 32 infants, and at one point in the ceremony telling mothers to feel free to feed their crying babies. Formally welcoming the children as members of the Catholic church, Francis poured water from a shell-shaped dish over the heads of the babies held in their mothers' arms. Francis pronounced the babies' names one by one, as beaming parents held their children, dressed in white satin or silk gowns and other finery, in the chapel whose ceiling was frescoed by Michelangelo.

Delivering an unusually brief and casual homily that centered on the 32 infants he was baptizing, the pope spoke affectionately of the children, as he urged their moms not to be intimated by their surroundings and to attend to their kids if the need arose.""Today the choir will sing, but the most beautiful choir of all is the choir of the infants who will make a noise. Some will cry because they are not comfortable or because they are hungry,"" Francis said, according to Reuters. ""If they are hungry, mothers, feed them, without thinking twice. Because they are the most important people here.""In an interview with La Stampa last month, Francis said moms should not be embarrassed about breastfeeding their babies in public.When asked about the state of hungry children in the world, Francis related this story about a mom and her newborn to the Italian newspaper: At the Wednesday General Audience the other day there was a young mother behind one of the barriers with a baby that was just a few month s old. The child was crying its eyes out as I came past. The mother was caressing it. I said to her: madam, I think the child’s hungry. “Yes, it’s probably time…” she replied. “Please give it something to eat!” I said. She was shy and didn’t want to breastfeed in public, while the Pope was passing. I wish to say the same to humanity: give people something to eat!"
