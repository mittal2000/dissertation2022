2,LATINO VOICES,Father Of Student Attacked By Police: U.S. Aid To Mexico 'Being Used To Kill Ordinary People',Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merida-initiative-human-rights_n_6988228.html,,2015-04-02,"Felipe de la Cruz, father of one of the 43 missing students, speaks during a press conference in Mexico city, on January 27, 2015. Mexico's Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said the investigation gave them 'the legal certainty that the students were killed'. Witness and expert testimony 'have allowed us to... come to the conclusion beyond a doubt that the students were abducted and killed, before being incinerated and thrown into the San Juan river, in that order,' he said. AFP PHOTO / RONALDO SCHEMIDT (Photo credit should read RONALDO SCHEMIDT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea5352400005000967979.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Felipe de la Cruz received a call from his son, Angel Neri, the night of Sept. 26, saying he and fellow college students were being attacked by police after stealing buses. De la Cruz urged his son to stay calm, thinking the cops would simply detain him. Instead, police in the city of Iguala killed three of Angel Neri de la Cruz’s classmates from a teachers' college in the nearby town of Ayotzinapa, and abducted 43. Angel Neri survived the attack. The remains of only one of his missing classmates have been identified. The Mexico attorney general’s office says police handed the abducted students over to a drug gang, which killed them and incinerated the corpses. But families of the victims say the government has mishandled the investigation and doubt all of those responsible for the attack have been arrested. The mass abduction prompted nationwide protests, sinking Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s popularity to the lowest level for the presidency since the aftermath of the 1994 peso crash. But Felipe de la Cruz isn’t just looking to Mexico for accountability. On the six-month anniversary of the attack last week, he was in Washington at a State Department demonstration, where he and other activists demanded the U.S. rethink a $2.3 billion aid program called the Mérida Initiative, implemented in 2007 to help Mexico fight drug cartels. “The Mérida Initiative is being used the wrong way,” de la Cruz told The Huffington Post. Instead of stopping organized crime, he argued, the security assistance has helped Mexican officials perpetuate human rights violations. “It’s being used to kill ordinary people.""  Students of the Ayotzinapa school and parents of the 43 missing students take part in a protest in Guadalajara City on Nov. 18, 2014. (Héctor Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images) U.S. law requires the State Department to regularly assess the Mexican government’s progress on human rights. Congress can elect to withhold up to 15 percent of the Mérida Initiative’s funding based on that assessment.Human rights defenders, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have long called for the State Department to be tougher in its evaluations of the Mexican government, and for Congress to withhold the entirety of that 15 percent.Congress has twice temporarily held back the funds based on the State Department's human rights assessments, once in 2010 and once in 2012, according to a Congressional Research Report from last year. Researchers at the Washington Office on Latin America, a group that tracks U.S. security assistance to Latin America, argue that the State Department's most recent ""15 Percent Report,"" published last year, is grounds for once again freezing the Mérida funds.“What’s interesting about last year’s report is that it basically said there was enough progress to allocate the funds,” Maureen Meyer, an associate at WOLA, told HuffPost. “We, and several other organizations, beg to differ on that.”Meyer says it appears that Congress has yet to disburse all of the money that is contingent on the 2014 human rights assessment. A much larger portion of the security assistance is still held up from previous years because the Peña Nieto administration has reworked the security strategy of its predecessor. The State Department did not answer requests to specify how much funding Congress has tied up. The latest “15 Percent Report” acknowledges that Mexican officials face credible allegations of serious abuses.“Criminal organizations remain significant perpetrators of killings and other abuses in Mexico,” the State Department report says. “At the same time, there are credible allegations against Mexican security forces of human rights violations and other abuses -- including those involving arbitrary detention, disappearances, unlawful killings, mistreatment, and torture. Violence against journalists and human rights defenders -- including murder, kidnapping, and threats, much of it with involvement of criminal organizations and corrupt officials -- is of particular concern.”The report also notes, however, that the Mexican government had made some progress in prosecuting military officials and police for torture and other abuses. Arturo Viscarra, advocacy coordinator for the School of the Americas Watch, which helped organize the demonstration in Washington, echoed the concerns about the Mérida Initiative. “This is a failed strategy,” Viscarra told HuffPost. “All it’s causing is more death. At the very least, the U.S. needs to show some measures of success. They refuse to that because it just shows how failed the [drug] war is.” For activists and human rights defenders on both sides of the border, the case of the missing students has become emblematic of the Mexican government’s human rights failures. Police forces coordinated the attack and abducted the students, authorities have said. Reporting by investigative journalists Anabel Hernández and Steve Fisher, based on leaked documents from the attorney general’s office, claims that police and military officials tainted the investigation by torturing key witnesses. It’s not an isolated incident of violence. A report by a U.N. fact-finding mission last month says that, in its effort to crack down on drug cartels, Mexico’s military and police routinely use brutal methods against suspects, including beatings, electrocution and rape. The courts convicted just five people for torture from 2007 to 2013, even though Mexico’s National Center for Human Rights received thousands of complaints of abuse during that period, according to the report. The Mexican government has said the U.N. report and other allegations of wrongdoing leveled by human rights groups exaggerate the severity of the situation. Mexico’s Foreign Secretary José Antonio Meade called the U.N. report “irresponsible and not very ethical.” Despite the pressure from human rights groups, the White House has avoided publicly criticizing Mexican officials. Instead, President Barack Obama has offered sympathy to the families of the students and lamented, in general terms, the violence Mexico faces. But he has stopped short of criticizing the Mexican government itself, throwing his support behind Mexican president Peña Nieto and his predecessor, Felipe Calderón. “Obviously, we’ve been following here in the United States some of the tragic events surrounding the students whose lives were lost,” Obama said on Jan. 6 after meeting with Peña Nieto at the White House. “Our commitment is to be a friend and supporter of Mexico in its efforts to eliminate the scourge of violence and the drug cartels that are responsible for so much tragedy inside of Mexico.”That tepid response to the Mexican government’s involvement in abuses doesn’t sit well with human rights organizations and members of the protest groups rallying behind the missing students. Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, Amnesty International’s advocacy director for the Americas, said it’s common for the United States to refrain from publicly criticizing allies, regardless of how dire the human rights situation. “It’s very frustrating,” Gonçalves Margerin told HuffPost. “One would hope that they are making criticisms behind closed doors if they’re not doing it publicly.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story's headline described Angel Neri de la Cruz as having been ""abducted"" rather than ""attacked."" In addition, an earlier version of this article misstated Arturo Viscarra's title at SOA Watch."
3,LATINO VOICES,A Way of Life: Juan Palma's Leadership on Public Lands,"Rod Torrez, ContributorLives in Northern New Mexico, Works with HECHO, a community of...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-way-of-life-juan-palmas_b_6988208.html,"I recently had the opportunity to speak with Juan Palma, a warm, friendly and highly respected leader in managing public lands, who retired last month after five years as the State Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Utah.",2015-04-02,2015-04-01-1427918369-9771560-GrandStaircaseBLM.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-01-1427918369-9771560-GrandStaircaseBLM-thumb.jpg," Juan Palma managed BLM lands in Utah for multiple uses. BLM PhotoI recently had the opportunity to speak with Juan Palma, a warm, friendly and highly respected leader in managing public lands, who retired last month after five years as the State Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Utah. Anyone familiar with the West would understand that being the State BLM Director in Utah is one of the biggest, most complicated, contentious jobs in any public lands agency. Utah's public lands encompass a sensitive, arid ecosystem, unparalleled geological resources, centuries upon centuries of cultural treasures, and some of the most iconic scenery in the United States. All these things are affected by the multiple ways humans use the land, from energy development, to agriculture, to outdoor recreation. Just negotiating the political minefields laid by competing interests across Utah's public lands would be challenging, to say the least. Juan Palma is noted for finding balance in working with the various interests. Most notably, he helped pioneer a new movement towards long range, landscape-wide planning that considers the multiple ways that people use the land. He was the force behind a pending draft Master Leasing Plan for the Moab area, where he garnered the participation of oil and gas developers, ranchers, and the outdoor recreation community. Working together is key for smart planningWhen I asked him how he got everyone to the table, his answer was straightforward. ""Collaboration,"" he said, and added:""We must meet face to face in order to see eye to eye.""More than just a little dicho, or ""saying,"" those simple words seem to be Palma's guiding principle. ""I put a lot of miles on my vehicle,"" he said, ""and sat down with some of the most ardent critics of the BLM. I sincerely wanted to know what they think, even if I disagreed with them."" And the BLM does have ardent critics. The most ardent may very well be those who believe that federal public lands shouldn't exist at all. In Utah and many other western states there is a movement afoot for state governments to take over federal lands -- and now they have some key allies on the hill, including Utah Representative Rob Bishop, Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, who, in a recent interview, indicated his interest in transferring federal public lands to states.Although I spoke to him before the Bishop interview appeared, Palma brought up the controversial congressman. ""I know Rob Bishop. I talk to Rob Bishop. At the end of the day I often disagree with him, but I want to understand where he is coming from."" On the particular issue of federal land transfers, Palma believes ""it isn't going anywhere."" The public will eventually realize that land transfers could translate into decreased access to public lands. Public access to millions of acres of public lands could be threatened by transferring federal lands to states. BLM PhotoPersonal history influenced public decisionsPalma went on to explain that his own perspectives on public lands and his approach to managing them has a lot to do with his own personal history and culture. As a child, he traveled with his parents, working fields from the San Joaquín Valley on northward into Washington. His family eventually settled in beet farming and fruit-growing country in Toppenish, Washington, on the Yakima Reservation. ""Those were my most formative years,"" he said. His time in the fields, and coming of age in a rural community, Palma was always surrounded by open spaces, yet his family lived in close quarters with other farm workers, so community was integral to daily living. He grew up a communicator, and as he would realize later, becoming a conservationist was also natural to him.""It wasn't until I was in my 30s, that I began to pursue a career in the public lands, --first with the National Forest service."" Like many people who work for public land agencies, Palma had to start at the bottom, working as a typist, and eventually moving to the BLM, where he would work his way up through the ranks to lead the agency in Utah, where BLM controls nearly half the land in the state. While he is known for saying that ""only in America"" can a migrant kid grow up to be in charge of so much land, he also acknowledges that growing up working on the land is the reason he came to appreciate and care for public lands so much. ""Our culture is tied to the outdoors. It has been for centuries,"" he says.Leaving a lasting legacyPalma's first month of retirement saw some big news coming out of the BLM and Department of Interior, and the coming months will likely see more big news. For people who enjoy the outdoors, the news is much more hopeful than February's Record of Decision on the Tres Rios Resource Management Plan, which could potentially develop over 90 percent of Southwestern Colorado. However, the newly announced Dinosaur Trail Master Leasing Plan in Colorado will protect Dinosaur National Monument from oil and gas development, as well as protect important wildlife areas. The draft Moab Master Leasing Plan will also likely be released in the spring, capping Palma's career with a hard-won success.Landscape-wide planning is smart planningI asked Juan Palma about the Master Leasing Plan (MLP) process, and why he supports it. ""It's the way things should be done, now and into the future,"" he said. The process is inclusive, bringing more than just one interest into account, and gives various communities affected by development more say in how and where development should occur, and which resources, including recreational and cultural resources, should be protected. The impact of oil and gas development in Utah is evident, even in scenic landscapes. Photo by Camilla SimonIn Moab, Utah, an MLP spells continued success for the recreation and tourism economy by protecting parks and public lands that are valuable to people who enjoy Moab's broad range of recreation opportunities, cultural resources and natural scenery. Hiking, mountain biking, jeeping, river running, and rock climbing are among the most popular activities that fuel Moab's economy. Canyonlands and Arches draw hundreds of thousands of people every year.""I see a new BLM in the future,"" Palma said. With new, landscape-wide planning processes like Master Leasing Plans, management decisions in areas are not necessarily left solely to a single field office. The BLM has generally run its planning processes through field offices in particular areas. More inclusive, regional planning could break that pattern, by creating a better public process as communities are engaged, and establishing more consistency throughout the system. ""I think the BLM will be a better agency,"" he said.Getting youth outdoorsBefore I closed our conversation, I wanted to know what the future holds for Juan Palma. ""I have a positive outlook,"" he said. ""I won't be doing this work anymore, but I still see myself being involved, somehow."" The outdoors and public lands is definitely in Palma's blood, and he returned to the idea of Latino values for the outdoors and conservation. ""We need to keep getting our youth out there,"" he said. ""It was easy for us to be connected to the outdoors as we grew up. But now it's easy to just stay indoors all the time. We need to keep those connections to the outdoors alive, so we don't lose our public lands.""  Latino students participate in a BLM conservation project in the Spring Creek Wilderness Study Area in Utah. BLM Photo "

We're here to tell you -- healthy skin doesn't have to be scary.",2015-04-02,2015-04-01-1427919350-2982038-LiraBioEnzymeCleanser.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-01-1427919350-2982038-LiraBioEnzymeCleanser-thumb.jpg,"We walked off of New York Fashion Week with mixed emotions: a combination of joy and horror.You may have noticed -- if stalking runway trends is your thing -- that this season's beauty trend is reminiscent of a bare face, a makeup trend that requires no makeup at all.Spawned by prevalence of the #selfie, this season's beauty look is natural, healthy skin. We saw bare-faced beauties strutting it down the runway at shows like Jason Wu and DKNY - however this trend has many of us asking ""how the heck do we pull this look off?"" While the bare face might be nice in theory, the reality might be a bit daunting. We're here to tell you -- healthy skin doesn't have to be scary. Below we've got your roadmap to this no makeup trend.First things first, go through your home care system and trim the fat. A good rule of thumb: If the ingredient list is overwhelmingly long and you can't pronounce most of the items, toss it! A product list is sorted by bulk, meaning that the first ingredient is what the product contains most of. If a product claims that it has active ingredients, these ingredients should be placed towards the top of the list in order to be effective. Lira Clinical is a brand we love, here's a look at a healthy ingredient list.Look at your skincare system in the following compartments: cleanse, exfoliate, repair, hydrate and protect. Overall we want to build a system that boosts and brightens.Step 1: When it comes to your cleanser make sure you're using the right one. Your cleanser should include ingredients like enzymes, which gently disintegrate dead skin cells (again derived from things you can pronounce such as pineapple or papaya). All of our best cleansers use agents that are naturally occurring in fruit and vegetables. These fruit or vegetable based agents do not strip the skin of its natural oils.Step 2: What are you doing to try to penetrate the skin? Are you using a scrub once or twice a week? Get into the habit of trying to free your face of dead skin. Using a gentle scrub is a great way to introduce your skin to exfoliation. Our newest obsession: Trufora Triple Action Exfoliator. This exfoliator combines chemical exfoliation, physical exfoliation and a deep, cleansing mask action to provide the most complete exfoliation without causing irritation to the skin. Think of it as the closest scrub to a peel you can use at home.If you're feeling daring shaving your face is a great way to literally shave off your dead skin.Now before you storm off in disbelief, understand that Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor were all adamant face shavers -- and all beauty symbols of their time.Shaving not only relieves you of unwanted facial hair but it also helps your make-up go on smooth, exfoliates and promotes young youthful skin. In the clinic it's also called dermalplaning.Step 3: Make sure you are treating your skin with a power packed serum and moisturizer. Try to get a serum with vitamin C or retinol to help you keep your skin bright and continuously renewing cells for youthful glow. Make sure you're following this with a good moisturizer that will protect and hydrate. When picking products make sure to avoid anything with parabens, and instead make sure that the last few ingredients on the list are essential oils. Essential oils are used as preservatives in place of parabens. Sounds easy right?Step 4: What's all the fuss with SPF? SPF is necessary. We repeat, it is necessary especially if you are going to start buffing off old layers of skin leaving your new skin exposed. It's important to make sure that you protect your skin to prevent dark spots, sunspots or pigmentation issues. Who wants those?!Once you start garnering more confidence try some stronger yet good at-home options. Some drugstore lines such as, Eclos Anti-Aging Moisture Therapy Regenerative Cream, offer ingredients that are pure, potent and skin regenerating. You can incorporate these into your current skincare regime.These tips are sure to help you revamp any dated skin care regiment you have had. However, as you start to grow a bit more confident with the idea of exfoliating, the next step is looking into peels and microdermabrasion.Follow these steps and in no time you'll have skin you'd proudly go bare with. Make sure to keep following us here as we help you demystify some of beauty's best-kept secrets!"
5,WOMEN,Ovaries Before Brovaries: Why Leslie Knope Is My Feminist Icon,"Allison Underhill, ContributorStudent, Indiana University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ovaries-before-brovaries-why-leslie-knope-is-my-feminist-icon_b_6988626.html,"I'm well aware that Leslie Knope is a fictitious character. However, through Amy Poehler's enthusiasm and witty inclusion of feminist principles, Leslie is brought to life.  Leslie Knope is the complete embodiment of feminism.",2015-04-02,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 19: Actress Amy Poehler arrives at the 2nd Annual Unite4:humanity Event at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 19, 2015 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb602ae200000990000f5ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Leslie Knope, you magnificent goddess.I recently finished binge-watching all seven seasons of Parks and Recreation on Netflix, and I'm not sure how to handle myself now that my time in Pawnee, Indiana has officially ended. While witnessing the entire Parks and Recreation department battle Pawnee's everyday mishaps was entertaining, nothing could possibly top watching Leslie Knope tackle the patriarchy. She clashes with Pawnee's conservative, small town mentality on multiple occasions, but is still determined to fight for what she believes in, whether its advocating safe sex for senior citizens or backing a controversial gay penguin marriage.Leslie Knope is the feminist icon we so desperately need. She's spunky, optimistic, and driven. She doesn't let anything interfere with her goals. She's a politician whose passion for her position in government is contagious. She strives to solve Pawnee's problems without breaking her code of ethics, which can be a slippery slope in politics. She isn't afraid to fail, and when she fails she accepts it with grace and dignity.The writers of Parks and Recreation could have modeled Leslie as a female version of Michael Scott from The Office. She could have been more interested in receiving the admiration of her peers than doing her actual job. In the first season of the series, Leslie has a few Michael Scott-esque moments. However, it is always evident that she is passionate about her job, and she earns the respect of her peers, male and female alike.My favorite quality about Leslie is the fact that she values women. Shortly after her election as city councilwoman, Leslie christens her new office by hanging a wall of inspirational women. These smart and powerful women range from Condoleezza Rice to Madeleine Albright to Sally Ride. Leslie even includes a picture of herself on the wall, remarking, ""I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself."" Leslie also celebrates the women in her life. She is indefinitely supportive of all her friends, making sure to shower them with compliments and encourage them to follow their dreams. She loves her friends so much that she created her own holiday, Galentine's Day. Every February 13th Leslie brings all her gal pals together and celebrates her relationship with each and every one of them. Galentine's Day is a great excuse to honor your girlfriends, eat waffles with whipped cream, and live by the motto ""Hoes before bros. Ovaries before brovaries. Uteruses before duderuses."" Another great feminist milestone for Leslie is found in the season 4 episode ""Pawnee Rangers."" After a little girl is denied membership to the all-boy Pawnee Rangers troop, Leslie takes it upon herself to organize the Pawnee Goddesses, an all-girls troop that throws puppy parties and has puppet shows about the Bill of Rights. The best part? The troop even lets boys join because gender exclusivity is not awesome. This entire episode is a not-so-subtle message that highlights the importance of giving young girls the opportunity to be independent, intelligent and strong. The episode also stresses the significance of not forcing young children into predetermined gender roles. The boys join the Pawnee Goddesses, make crafts and eat candy, while some of the girls opt to join ""The Swansons,"" Ron Swanson's group that focuses on wilderness survival skills.The greatest thing about Leslie Knope is that she never straight out says she is a feminist; her actions do all of the talking. Remember when she collected trash for a day, all in the name of feminism? After she confronts the sanitation workers for virtually not having a female representation in their department, she is met with the accusation that the average woman cannot handle the level of physical labor the job requires. Leslie responds by taking the opportunity to work as a trash collector for a day. Although she naturally is faced with some obstacles and a sabotage attack, Leslie successfully completes her route, forcing the sanitation department to hire more female employees. I'm well aware that Leslie Knope is a fictitious character. However, through Amy Poehler's enthusiasm and witty inclusion of feminist principles, Leslie is brought to life. Leslie Knope is the complete embodiment of feminism; she doesn't treat feminism as a fad diet that will fade in a few weeks. Through her actions she demonstrates that feminism is good for everyone. Is political, social, and economical equality for all genders really too much to ask for?"

This blog today is all about just that, education.",2015-04-02,2015-04-01-1427924132-4751057-SparkofLifeandCrossroadsFinalScreenshot40115.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-01-1427924132-4751057-SparkofLifeandCrossroadsFinalScreenshot40115-thumb.jpg,"Aristotle, a world renowned philosopher and scientist once said that ""Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all."" This blog today is all about just that, education. We all know that education is a hot topic and it's big. It is an important topic, its fundamental, its universal, it's philosophical, its controversial and it's on going. Over time and in our history, school and education and America's future, our children's future, is the conversation from government to toddlers in pre-schools and for sure one that never ends. This is about education at the middle and high school level, education at a very special place, education at a school called Crossroads. Crossroads School is an extraordinary non-profit private school in Santa Monica, California. It's awesome, it's exceptional, it sits on top of the heap in the educational realm and academically across the board in both public and private school systems. It's a school that includes everything from books, blackboards, computers, pens, pencils and paper to minds, hearts and souls. Crossroads School is traditional, classic, and regal, it's edgy, out of the box, risk taking, and absolutely at the forefront of a trend. It's a school that maintains a comprehensive education format that is steeped in rich intelligence and at the same time is progressive, courageous, committed and devoted to the highest vibration of education. It's a place where princes and paupers both walk together and are still just the same.It's all about their exceptional and unprecedented premiere program called life skills. Their life skills program has earned them acclaims, accolades and admirations. It is viewed by many as brilliant and clearly has made Crossroads a mastermind of a newfound phenomenon or, the boy wonder of education or a prodigy among other schools.Life skills is a program that teaches emotional intelligence. It is a program where words are spoken, voices are heard and stories are shared, where hearts, minds and souls are included with intellectual intelligence. It is by far the greatest gift that Crossroads has imparted to the educational world and it's why Crossroads has made such a difference.Every year in their life skills program, in the days of February, March and April, Angels at Risk is invited to teach and show children and in turn families how to keep themselves safe from the intrusion and infringement of drug and alcohol use and abuse in the simplest and kindest of ways. Through the structure and storytelling of our prevention education platform and programs we get to prevent harms way for children, teens, parents and the community. It is a mission that we all hold together because it's honorable with heart and is on point with the future. The ripple effect is profound.Our Angels at Risk speakers and counselors tell their optimistic cautionary tales in confidence that kids and teenagers and everybody listening will stay close to their deepest wishes and dreams. All their tales are told in a child friendly way with a beginning, middle and an end and each story includes families, friends, schools, feelings and facts. They continue our Angels at Risk philosophy highlighting and focusing primarily on always reaching out, believing, communicating, and connecting. And for parents, to protect, don't give up and be brave enough to love big which isn't always easy, but it works. Most of all for everybody to never be alone. We never know 100 percent who we are going to help, how we are going to help them or even when the help we try to teach them is going to show up in their lives for prevention, like love, is tricky to measure. What we do know is it's always positive for all those who participate. Maybe best said by a 19 year old boy who wants to volunteer in our programs by telling his story and is aspiring to be of service, ""If I help one kid then I consider that a victory. Just one. Well that's a victory to me."" And what we know further at Angels at Risk is that the listeners always hold deep appreciation for the speaker's truths, and they say so. They write surveys of words and art that express a trillion other comments and compliments that are each weighted in gold. It's life's win-win for the storyteller and the story listener. It's having one faith, it's following our hearts, intuitions, our desperations to help another. Believing that we find our ways together, and not alone, but with each other.Honestly, by welcoming prevention in a wholesome, happy way the paradigm of this issue for Crossroads School, contrary to other schools, has shifted, it has changed. There is a new voice, a healthy voice, a wise voice about drug and alcohol use and abuse for kids and their families together. It's a new beginning, it's a new life and they have a community that is not separated or afraid. All of this has given them a special spark of life.In 2008, an article titled, ""Discussing the Truth,"" written by a Crossroads School student that quoted Tom Nolan, dean of students and Angels at Risk board member, directly says, ""From my perspective, all youth in America are at risk for substance abuse...the goal of Angels at Risk, is to create a collaborative approach to keeping kids safe families, schools, and community working together to optimize our children's futures.""The spark of life or the stroke of genius is this commitment to human justice and the idea that people are a combination of a lot of parts and that education needs to include and remember that all those parts work together like pieces of a puzzle to paint a picture and tell the story completely. It's exactly what Aristotle talked about, where educating the mind and educating the heart come together.The past idea about education that has been iron clad intellectual has been quietly and radically pierced by Crossroad's courage to marry life skills and emotional intelligence to just that, the intellect. And we at Angels at Risk are lucky. We thank them, Crossroads School, for including us and our mission to help kids and their communities in even the tiniest of ways we have gotten to help. Bill Gates, a true philanthropic genius and hero often implies that the educational system might be the most difficult system to navigate help and shift, and that the lockdown of this system is nothing close to human justice. Further cited from the Huffington Post article on January 3, 2013 titled, ""Bill Gates: Education is the one Issue that's Key to America's Future,"" Bill Gates spoke about ""singled out education as the issue that could most determine America's future."" He also said about education that, ""It's our tool of equality."" He also believes that ""education is the greatest predictor of America's future."" So maybe the locator, the anchor, the lighthouse, the beacon of hope and finally the spark of life for America's future as far as the ""education factor"" goes for all schools and foundations, including The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who might be at a crossroads, would be to check out Crossroads School, check out Angels at Risk and remember to include the whole child, the total person all of it together, intellectually, emotionally, and maybe even in soul. The obvious closer, and the big shout out of this blog is to Crossroads School, headmaster Bob Riddle and Jamie. But most of all to Tom Nolan, the Dean, whose soul is grand and heart is magnificent and mind is that of a whiz kid. His convictions for justice for all humanity is unprecedented and evidenced by the impact and affect he has on the hearts and the lives of students, families and communities all around that he has preserved and saved. He is nothing short of a word to be admired."

Jim said this around the time he was up on charges in Miami. False charges, by the way. He didn't expose himself... I was there! He was definitely drunk and yet was acquitted of public drunkenness. So goes the justice system. Outgoing Governor Crist pardoned Jim as a kind gesture to the deceased, but a pardon implies guilt.Lighten up, John, these government people are trying to make nice.

But why is it so remarkable?In the 2010 Census, 9 million people -- or 2.9 percent of the population -- chose more than one race to describe themselves -- a change of about 32 percent since 2000. Mixed-race children are the country's fastest-growing demographic. And our president -- although he self-identifies as African-American -- comes from a decidedly mixed-race family.Some pundits say that Noah's upbringing as a biracial child in South Africa is notable because it provides him with a unique perspective on American race relations. And surely it will.But what I think is most remarkable is the way that Noah's mixed-race funny man status allows us to fundamentally change the conversation we've had about mixed-race identity and experience.Historically, the story told about mixed-race people was governed by the trope of the tragic mulatto: a melodramatic tale about a mixed-race character who cannot find a place in either black nor white society because of the curse of her mixed blood.Today, mixed-race identity and experience is too often part of the national conversation when it is a flashpoint of long-held racial prejudices. Take for example, the latest flap over the newly crowned mixed-race Miss Japan who many consider not Japanese enough; or the controversy about the biracial star Zendaya playing singer Aaliyah in a biopic. Zendaya, critics said, wasn't black enough. And would we have paid as much attention to the heart-warming Cheerios commercial featuring an interracial family had there not been such a hateful response from YouTube commenters?Noah introduces a humorous take on his mixed heritage to mainstream America. Simply put, Noah is going to take the tragic out of mulatto one joke at a time.We are lucky to be in a new age where comedians like Noah and comedic phenoms Key & Peele can mine their biracial backgrounds for their comedy. And they are not the only ones. This year, The Daily Show's Al Madrigal produced a comedic documentary Half Like Me about mixed-race identity, and Tracee Ellis Ross, a mixed chick herself, plays a mixed chick on ABC's hit black-ish with humor and grace. There are many more comedians in the wings ready to take center stage with their own humorous view of the Mixed experience including: Rain Pryor, Sunda Croonquist, Tehran, Abbi Crutchfield and Alex Barnett.So, Mr. Noah, it's time to bring it. We're ready to talk about the complicated and crazy issues and stories about the mixed-race experience and move the needle on the conversation. And mostly, we're ready to laugh."

Big business is going down in this micro-blogging world.Avid art collector and movie star Leo DiCaprio turned to Instagram for the latest addition to his burgeoning art collection. The actor secured this painting by artist Jean-Pierre Roy, titled ""Nachlass (2015),"" after seeing it on the social media image-sharing site. The piece was on display at PULSE New York Contemporary Art Fair, through Copenhagen's Gallery Poulsen. A representative for Gallery Poulsen said, ""Leonardo spotted it on Instagram and bought it over the phone.""No word on if he double-tapped and hired a Taskrabbit to pick it up. What is this? A painting for ants?  Well. Yes, actually. Last year Lorraine Loots, a miniaturist painter from Cape Town, South Africa started a new project. She decided to do one miniaturist painting a day, measuring smaller than 30mm x 30mm. Her friends teased her, asking what she was going to do with paintings that were so small. She started joking back that they were for ants. The project quickly grew legs. She followed up the initial project with a series titled 365 Postcards for Ants, focusing on her native Cape Town, earning immense Instagram fame. Picasso's electrician forced to give back $100 million 'gift'  Pierre Le Guennec was living the life. An electrician living in the south of France in the early 1970's, he got the once-in-a-lifetime gig of installing burglar alarms - among other things - for one Mr. Pablo Picasso. Guennec worked for Picasso for three years, until the artist died in 1973, and continued to work for his widow, Jacqueline, until she died 13 years later. For his years of loyal servitude, Jacqueline allegedly gave him a trunk full of the artist's original works as a gift; a collection of cubist collages, drawings, lithographs, notebooks and a watercolor. Score, right?Not so fast. Fast forward 40 years, to when Pierre contacted Picasso's son to have the works authenticated. Authenticate they did, but not before they slapped him with a lawsuit alleging they were received illegally.After several years in court, a French judge finally ruled that Le Guennec must return the paintings (valued at $100 million). Ouch! Following the verdict, Picasso's daughter poured salt about as poetically as words will allow: ""It's a downright cheek to try and make us swallow that story."" Double ouch!Like what you read?

This piece posed an intriguing answer to this puzzling question: Where are all the extraterrestrials?(If you think the answer is ""Roswell, New Mexico,"" go sit with Bigfoot and be quiet -- adults are talking.)The Drake equation gives us an order of magnitude feel for how many advanced civilizations there could be in the universe by looking at parameters such as the percentage of stars that have planets, the percentage of those planets which have the right conditions to support life, etc. There are a lot of unknowns in these parameters, but the upshot is that even if one assumes conservative conditions, there should be millions of advanced civilizations out there right now.Enrico Fermi famously phrased the question: ""So where are they?"" thus spawning the eponymous Fermi paradox. With so many potential civilizations, why is the cosmos not saturated with radio signals, with extraterrestrial equivalents of Keeping Up With the Kardashians streaming into space from a thousand different tacky cultures? Despite the implications of the Drake equation, we have never encountered even the slightest hint of extraterrestrial life, not the faintest wisp of a stray radio signal from a distant civilization. SETI is listening diligently, but so far, the universe is sepulchrally quiet.One answer to Fermi's paradox is dark. Uranium is ubiquitous. There's so much uranium in the Earth that it's played an important role in keeping our mantle hot, and hence keeping plate tectonics functioning. (We're the only planet we know of with both life and plate tectonics. The recycling of the crust and its essential elements through tectonics suggests this isn't a coincidence.) Because uranium is everywhere in the universe, any advanced civilization would inevitably discover the basics of fission and learn how to create an atomic bomb. So perhaps the solution to Fermi's paradox is that advanced civilizations inevitably annihilate themselves with nuclear war, as we came so close to doing (and still have the potential to achieve). We don't see UFOs buzzing around because given enough time, each nascent civilization enters a nuclear age -- and they don't make it out.That seems unlikely. Sure, it's reasonable to assume that warfare and conflict are not unique to humans, but would that be universally true for all possible civilizations? Millions of them? Surely one would develop along the lines of The Big Lebowski, a civilization populated with alien versions of The Dude, aspiring not to warfare, but only to abide on a comfortable couch, pontificating about how well the rug tied the room together, while sending radio waves into space proclaiming this slacker anthem.So maybe the real answer to Fermi's paradox is climate change. Adam Frank's piece in the New York Times put it this way:From climate change to resource depletion, our evolution into a globe-spanning industrial culture is forcing us through the narrow bottleneck of a sustainability crisis. In the wake of this realization, new and sobering answers to Fermi's question now seem possible.An interesting thought. While we can't assume life on other planets employs the same chemistry as our M-class planet, with its nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, the issue of energy would still come up. In any variety of energy-providing chemical reactions, organisms would still generate and have to deal with waste products. As Frank puts it, ""There are no planetary free lunches.""It's notable that Earth's atmosphere has already undergone a major shift due to the activities of organisms. Over three billion years of photosynthesizing bacteria transformed the atmosphere from oxygen depleted to our current 21 percent. The oxygen you breathe now is the waste product of biology that stripped carbon from oxygen to form carbohydrates, some of which were later altered into the hydrocarbons now spewing out the tailpipes of stretch Humvees.On a vast scale our species pushes this in the other direction, taking carbon and recombining it with oxygen. So far we've been fortunate that our carbon dioxide waste is absorbed in the oceans and used by many other things -- plants, diatoms, mineral weathering -- meaning anthropogenic increases have not been as steep as they could have been. But those natural reservoirs are not infinite, and the rate of carbon dioxide increase is dramatically accelerating. From 1965 to 1974, the rate of carbon dioxide increase averaged 1.06 ppm per year; from 2005 to 2014, the rate doubled to 2.11 ppm per year.As we continue this planetary-scale geoengineering experiment of pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and seeing what happens, it's worth considering that maybe this path has already been taken by predecessors a long time ago, in galaxies far, far away. Why don't we hear them now?Maybe Adam Frank's proposal is right, and our current climate crisis is so intractable that other civilizations have tried and failed and collapsed. But we humans did get through the most dangerous phase of the nuclear era, which for so long seemed guaranteed to end us all. At the very least we have the potential to get through our climate conundrum, which, like the nuclear danger, is a failing of our political systems, not our scientific knowledge. Just as Neo in The Matrix had five predecessors who failed, the universe might need a few tries before finally solving the difficult problem of maintaining a civilization without destroying its planet."

People long to be part of something bigger than them. As such, pet food brands touting fresh perspective and a fragrant brand purpose are becoming movements. And these movements ultimately serve to benefit equity and drive share harder, both for a few established brands but moreover for upstarts and challenger brands.The pet food brands that instigate movements align with and generate more passionate advocates especially among millennial and Gen Z consumers who are on the look out for brands willing to try and change society or culture. As food culture changes for humans, so, too, does it change for our best friends. There is a lot of emotion surrounding the ones we love, and that naturally extends to our cats and dogs. The questions some marketers are asking is how do we use disruptive innovation in marketing to tap into these passions in new ways.To the owners of these movement brands, the business value of mass engagement by the culture includes earned media (on top of paid media) and greater penetration, conversion and loyalty through word of mouth. Net, they help build share. If you are the established brand, this is the competitive edge. If you're an upstart, this is the secret to an accelerated trajectory in the market. New challenger brands are creating perceived momentum in an area of our lives where we thought we already had plenty of good choices. Think back to the days when brands like Nestle Purina, and Beneful as well as Iams, Cesar, Royal Canin and Peidgree brands (owned by Mars Petcare) were in the cupboard. Back then, we thought we had loads of choice. Then we went to the vet and saw Science Diet (owned by Colgate-Palmolive) and Eukanuba (another Mars brand) behind the white-frocked person behind the counter. These were all good household names. My family had several pets and we fed them these brands. Fast forward to 2015. Now there is Blue Buffalo Pet Food, Nature's Variety Instinct, Addiction and several others. These are the challenger brands. They take nothing for granted. They enter the pet store near you with lots of gumption and new marketing ideas that challenge the traditional pattern of pet food advertising. They smash through the clichés of pet food advertising, namely:  - the shiny-coated pet TV commercial - the dog-lover speaking to camera about how wonderful the food is commercial - the pet running towards the master for a hug in glowing sunlight commercial.  - who can forget the tried and true dog running through the grass shot, blazing its way to the food bowl - And the pièce de résistance, of course, is the lick shot on the child's grinning face commercial. All these clichés are perhaps one of the reasons why the newcomers are gaining ground for their brands, in addition to the new formulations and product attributes. Much like Chipotle is doing in the fast food business, these new brands are challenging the marketing status quo in pet food and gaining a lot of passionate advocates in the process -- people who are very vocal on social media. ""I think one of the main tasks for the innovator is often the communication. Since you're creating a product that meets a new need, there's work involved in explaining exactly what you've created and how it's better than what people are in the habit of using,"" says Lucy Postins, founder of the human-grade whole-food pet food company. What some pet food marketers do has changed almost beyond recognition; the tactics used to drive brand awareness, interest and loyalty are completely different from the marketing mix of just a few years ago. The challenger brands are forced to be more innovative. But interestingly, the marketing of traditional brands has not changed much since the discipline of brand management was first developed over fifty years ago.With less market share, and more modest budgets, the challenger brands by nature have to do more with less, and many of them have on the whole devised approaches that will best prepare their brands to effectively connect and interact with pet owners to drive business growth.  Case is point is a new campaign by Nature Variety's Instinct called Long Live Pets, that's making a lot of waves. It's a social movement to fight for rescue dogs across America. By aligning with such a large and passionate group of pet-owners, Instinct touches a nerve with a lot of people. You upload a photo of your rescue pet, which will be turned into a series of films that will run nationally (full disclosure we worked on this brand). Likewise, Blue Buffalo has pervasive advertising that is deliberately ""in-your-face."" It encourages ""pet parents"" to compare the Buff to the competition, the founder of the company told Bloomberg. Blue Buffalo's television spots and Internet videos have become so familiar they've been parodied on Saturday Night Live. The mock commercial for ""Blue River"" dog food aired on NBC. Guest host Seth Rogen and SNL cast member Cecily Strong played the sort of overwrought consumers who philosophize about pet nutrition in Blue Buffalo's actual ads. The characters suffer an emotional meltdown as they discuss what they've fed their bug-eyed pug mix, Peanut.I have a set of friends who are so suspicious of pet food that they only serve their dog food what they cook for the family and eat. Unabashedly, the dog has a comfortable place at the table.Against these challengers the big pet food brands are fighting back. In a very public campaign in 2014, Nestle Purina took Blue Buffalo to task, saying the upstart brand is falsely claiming its products contain no animal byproducts or grain. This campaign was backed by an unusually sophisticated communications effort that included its own website, petfoodhonesty.com according to Ad Age. As a consumer overwhelmed by the profusion of brands, it's increasingly more confusing and difficult to know what's right for your little Balthazar or Zorro. In the past we relied on our gut.

He is lost to us but he is as Light and an angel with his Father and remains with us in memory and adoration and will so remain for ever."" -- Rabbi Samuel Adler,  Temple Emanu-El, New York, April 19, 1865""Abraham Lincoln! That name ... will ever be coupled with a blessing, words of sympathy and sweet remembrance in every household; to the world it will prove a watchword, a tower of strength for men to rally around, to move them to combat manfully for right."" -- Rabbi M.R. Deleeuw,  Congregation B'nai Israel, New York, April 19, 1865   Alonzo Chappel, The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln, 1868. Oil on canvas. Courtesy of the Chicago History Museum.Abraham Lincoln was shot on April 14, 1865, in the midst of the Passover holiday. Because so many Jews were in synagogue when Lincoln died the following day, it seemed, as the Jewish social welfare leader Adolphus S. Solomons wrote, ""a singular fact that it was the Israelites' privilege... to be the first to offer in their places of worship, prayers for the repose of [his] soul."" Jews attending synagogues throughout America listened as rabbis likened Lincoln to Moses. ""Like our own law-giver, Moses,"" as a sermon at Congregation Mikveh Israel noted, Lincoln ""brought a nation to the verge of the haven of peace, and, like him, [was] not allowed to participate in its consummation."" In New York, authors of Passover sermons urged congregations to dedicate themselves to Lincoln's pious principles of self-sacrifice, mercy, and dedication to freedom and equality. New York's Jews had been divided during the Civil War, but they united in their grief behind this single, martyred leader whom God had given America at a time of crisis, and now had taken away. At Temple Emanu-El the congregation, according to The New York Times, ""as if by a simultaneous impulse rose and repeated the Kaddish, a prayer for the nearest deceased relative."" At Shearith Israel, Kaddish was also said. It was the first time in the history of American Judaism that these prayers were offered for anyone not of the Jewish faith. For a week beginning April 17, 1865, hundreds of organizations across the city met to express grief and pass resolutions in support of the government. As Jews filed by Lincoln's casket, in New York and at other stops along the route, which reversed the 1600-mile trek that had brought him from Illinois to Washington, D.C. in 1861, they experienced a personal loss. How personal? Very personal, a new exhibition at the New-York Historical Society argues. And not simply in the wake of Lincoln's assassination. Lincoln, as the exhibition and its accompanying book by Jonathan Sarna and Benjamin Shapell demonstrate with copious examples, ""interacted with Jews, commissioned Jews, trusted Jews, defended Jews, pardoned Jews, took advice from Jews, gave jobs to Jews, extended rights to Jews, revoked an expulsion of Jews, and even chose a Jew as his confidential agent."" Indeed, Lincoln uniquely called, in writing, a Jewish man, Abraham Jonas, ""one of his most valued friends.""Following Lincoln's death, New York became the nation's center for enshrining Lincoln's legacy for the ages. It is, for that reason, particularly fitting that Lincoln and the Jews be on view at New-York Historical during this year's 150th anniversary of his assassination. As a 2009 New-York Historical exhibition on Lincoln and New York showed, two romanticized images prevailed as part of his legacy. One showed the president with Mary and their children: like most fellow-citizens a man rooted in his family life, balancing the concerns of war with those of ordinary life. The second tied Lincoln to George Washington. Elevating Lincoln as the nation's ""savior"" to equal standing with its ""father"" smoothed over the crisis of disunion. God had blessed America, these images proclaimed, by providing Americans with such leaders at exactly the right moment. In his apotheosis, printmakers identified Lincoln with patriotism, family life, and with the preservation of freedom and the destruction of slavery. As American Jewish communities prepare for Passover this year, this image of our American Moses makes good sense to recall. But recalling Lincoln, whose assassination shattered the nation's spirit -- exactly at the first moment it could taste victory and the return of peace -- also reminds us of the causes for which Lincoln lived and died, and by which his countrymen should live henceforth."

José Andrés has almost single-handedly introduced Americans to real Spanish food. Photo Credit: Aaron ClamageFood is power, or at least an instrument of power -- economic, political, moral. Those who control our food supply control us, for better or worse. They decide, to a greater extent than we imagine or would like, what and how we eat -- if we eat, in extreme cases. Who are these people? Who are the most powerful people in the American food world?In 2011, we attempted to answer this question for the first time. We're still at it; this is our fifth annual ranking of The 50 Most Powerful People in Food.Click Here to see America's 50 Most Powerful People in Food for 2015When we talk about power, in this context, we're talking about the ability to make things happen, rewrite the rules, shift the paradigms, change the conversation. We're talking about power that is governmental, commercial, and sometimes inspirational. The men and women who wield this power till many fields; they're agribusiness moguls, CEOs of major food processing and distribution concerns and retail food outlets, elected or appointed officials who concern themselves with the economics and the safety of our food supply, celebrity chefs and other public figures who start trends and speak up for what they believe, and activists and journalists who try, with varying degrees of success, to improve conditions under which food is raised or processed and to influence the menus from which we select our meals.A ranked listing of powerful people, in any arena, is subjective, of course. Power comes in too many flavors. However, that doesn't mean that it has to be arbitrary. To come up with our Most Powerful in past years, The Daily Meal editors did extensive research, reading news stories, annual statements, and editorial analyses, and consulting with experts in the various fields we cover. Then we shuffled the rankings according to strenuous and sometimes contentious editorial discussion.This year, we attempted to bring more order to the process. Once we came up with a long initial roster, we graded each nominee on five criteria: the number of people the candidate reaches, the number of venues through which the candidate can reach people, past accomplishments, potential for future accomplishments, and proven ability to reach and influence people through their actions.Slightly more than two-thirds of the people listed here are return visitors from previous rankings. Among the new faces are Yancey Strickler (#25), founder and CEO of Kickstarter, the crowd-source investment website that, while hardly exclusive to the culinary world, has helped bankroll everything from restaurants and food trucks to a molecular sensor that will send content breakdowns of food (and other things) to your smartphone; congressman Jim McGovern (D.-Mass.) (#27), co-chair of the House Hunger Caucus and Congressional Hunger Center and a major mover and shaker in child nutrition and hunger relief programs; Howard Schultz (#6), CEO of Starbucks, the chain that is fast exceeding the coffee market and becoming a major take-out food provider and is adding beer, wine, and snacks to many locations (and already provides us with many calories worth of energy through all those supersweet specialty drinks); Susan Neely (#4), president and CEO of the American Beverage Association, the lobbying and trade organization for the $140 billion non-alcoholic beverage industry in this country; sometimes controversial best-selling author and talk-show host Mehmet Oz (#32) -- Dr. Oz to you -- whose pronouncements on food and nutrition echo throughout the land; and late-night host Jimmy Fallon (#41), a genuine food-lover, who brings top chefs (and Top Chefs) into more households than Food Network does (extra points for having fried-chicken guru Questlove on board as bandleader).As in the past, we've included some household names -- television personality Rachael Ray (#12); First Lady and dietary advocate Michelle Obama and her husband (#13), the latter of whose positions on the Farm Bill, immigration, and other broad issues have great impact on our food system; Chez Panisse founder and Edible Schoolyard apostle Alice Waters (#45); and The New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells (#39), to name four -- but many of the names here may be less than familiar to the average reader. Among these are Jeremy Stoppelman (#10), co-founder and CEO of Yelp, the hate-it-but-can't-stop-using-it review site; Donnie Smith (#19), president and CEO of Tyson, because, well, chicken; Jack Sinclair (#2), executive vice president of the largest food retailer in the world: the grocery division of Walmart; and Fred DeLuca (#30), co-founder and CEO of Subway, the build-your-own-sandwich chain that just keeps rolling along.Every year, when we publish this ranking, we hear from readers outraged that we would ""honor"" this or that person, whether a corporate honcho or a nannyish naysayer. And every year, we answer that this is not necessarily a ranking of our favorite people, or of those we consider to be most admirable. Food policies and the food choices available to us in America are all too often affected by people whose organizations or philosophies we do not find admirable in the least. They know who they are. Here, then, are The 50 Most Powerful People in Food, 2015 edition. What do you think? Did we miss somebody that should have been here, or include somebody that doesn't really fit?

15,ARTS,Interview With Yan Pei Ming,"Elena Cué, ContributorArt writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/interview-with-yan-pei-mi_b_6978428.html,"Yan Pei Ming is, perhaps, one of the best examples of what it means today to be an artist in a global world -- where human beings, in a particularly dramatic way, are confronting experiences of solitude and death.",2015-04-01,2015-03-31-1427820166-7014488-YanPeiMing_2014_by_SB.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-31-1427820166-7014488-YanPeiMing_2014_by_SB-thumb.jpg,"""I am not afraid of dying. I am afraid of no longer living.""""No Comment"" is the title for the opening of the exhibition of Chinese artist, Yan Pei Ming, at the Center for Contemporary Art in Málaga (CAC, Centro de Arte Contemporáneo).Yan Pei Ming (b. 1960, Shanghai) grew up during the Maoist Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and worked as an artist to support the regime. Later on, he was part of the first group of artists to flee China in 1980. With great expectations, he arrived in France to study Fine Arts and earned a degree in that subject in Dijon, Paris and Rome. This geographical, cultural and artistic shift has had a substantial impact on his work.The work of Yan Pei Ming stands out because of its decisively simple palette of red, white and black, and its forceful yet precise brushstroke line that sends us into his private world. His work primarily focuses on the portrait, an artistic genre that he depicts by emphasizing the psychological burden displayed by his iconic subjects. When you enter into the Parisian studio of this French-Chinese artist, you get the immediate sensation that you've not only traveled through the history of Western painting, but also that you've seen traces of the time period when he was working to support the Mao regime. All in all, Yan Pei Ming is, perhaps, one of the best examples of what it means today to be an artist in a global world -- where human beings, in a particularly dramatic way, are confronting experiences of solitude and death. Elena Cué: You grew up in China in the midst of the Cultural Revolution and then relocated to France when you were 20 years old. You studied for five years at the National Superior School of Fine Arts in Dijon. What was the pictorial evolutionary process like going from the limitation of propagandist art to support the regime to complete freedom?Yan Pei Ming: At that time in China, the influence on painting was from the classical tradition originating from the Soviet Union. It was propagandist painting to support the regime at that time. Those five years that I spent at the National Superior School of Fine Arts in Dijon were years of absolute freedom for me. From that moment on, I was able to combine what I learned from propagandist painting with a very individualized view of today's world. My freedom of expression is very noticeable in my current work. E.C: How did you survive the East to West cultural shock, going from a communist regime to Mitterrand's Socialist France?Y.P.M: In France, individuality was what stood out. In my opinion, the politics of François Mitterrand were, no doubt, socialist, but still liberal. E.C: You graduated from the French Academy (Villa Medici) in Rome in 1993. What was your impression of Italy? What was that experience like?  Y.P.M: It was one-of-a-kind. I had an incredible year. It was as if I was in paradise, following the steps of all of the great painters that had come through this city. Those old masters help me to understand art from the past and they pave the way for me to make art that must be done nowadays. It was an unforgettable experience for me. E.C: What memories do you have from childhood?Y.P.M: My childhood was blessed, but lonely. Even from my earliest years, I was in my own universe. I always dreamed of being a painter because I could express myself without words. That's powerful. E.C: You have painted your father several times, even dead. Tell me about him, please.Y.P.M: I have always done portraits of my father, just as much in China as in France. I have captured him at different times in his life, and at different ages. My way of seeing him has evolved over the years. Also, there are oftentimes characteristics and defects that I've been able to find in the titles of those portraits. It's true that the way in which a child sees his father is not the same way an adult sees an older parent. I think that my portraits of him bring that to light. E.C: You have depicted Mao on several occasions. What does that mean and who is Mao, in your opinion?Y.P.M: He has been present in my work since I was a boy. His was the most copied and most widespread image in China. That left a mark on me. I also remember that my first lesson at school was entitled, Long Live President Mao! He is a mythical character. E.C: Your 2009 exhibition, ""The Funerals of Mona Lisa,"" made you the first Chinese artist to exhibit at the Louvre Museum. A huge portrait of Mona Lisa was accompanied by four paintings: two self-portraits depicting skulls from the cranium scanner, a portrait of your dead father and a self-portrait in which you pretend to be dying, which tops off the exhibition. Why is Mona Lisa crying? Can you explain this peculiar scene?Y.P.M: It is a piece that I did in 2009 for the Louvre. It is a polyptych called, ""The Funerals of Mona Lisa."" I reinterpreted Leonardo da Vinci's portrait to be Mona Lisa crying at her own funeral and in front of spectators. My expression is similar to that of Marcel Duchamp after adding a few whiskers. E.C: Your existential concern began at a very young age. The ongoing presence of death in your thinking is constantly represented in your work. Does the idea of death make you reaffirm life?Y.P.M: A lot of emotional states appear in my work: my anxiety, my pain, my uncertainty. It is important for death to be present as well -- and, of course, energy and life. I don't need to sugarcoat or make things fancy. Paintings aren't for cuddling. E.C: What worries you most about death?Y.P.M: When I think about death, I rise up. From that point on, I work even harder to fill up on life. I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of no longer living. E.C: Iconic paintings of art history and celebrities, your self-portraits and the representation of your father. Do you think that it is a way to transcend?  Y.P.M: I'm interested in everything, just as much art history as historical figures and the anonymous. The construction of history and sociopolitical issues interest me a lot. They all form our world as well as my painting. E.C: Much of your work involves portraits, primarily figures, politicians or celebrities with sometimes serious and solemn expressions, yet kind and friendly other times. To what extent do portraits relate to the passing of time, as it does with Rembrandt?Y.P.M: You're right. Rembrandt is a master portrait artist, especially the self-portrait. He's an important artist in my eyes. He's not the only one. There are also French, Italian and Spanish painters like Goya, El Greco, Velázquez and Picasso. E.C: The revealing and fierce strength in your pictorial expression, combined with the huge sizes of the canvases and the drama of your simplified color palette of white and black or white and red really emphasize the emotional burden that's conveyed by those depicted. What are you most interested in drawing out from each character?  Y.P.M: In my opinion, the individual is the essence of humanity. A portrait allows the individual and their time period to be seen.E.C: You stated on one occasion, ""What interest me about a person are their attitudes, fears and lives, which are often tragic."" Is the goal to feel less alone when facing one's fears and one's existence?Y.P.M: I'd like the world to share my anxiety and my fears. E.C: In your series on killers -- people that randomly snatch life away -- what is it that interests you about them?Y.P.M: Animals have always fought to survive. I think that the same thing happens with man. Conflicts, wars and injustices are characteristic of man. E.C: As an artist, where do you see beauty?Y.P.M: To me, beauty is found in painting.   E.C: Your interest in Goya shows up in your reinterpretation of The Executions of May 3 or in Picasso, whom you've depicted. Have you been to the Prado Museum? What do you think of our Spanish masters?Y.P.M: I've visited the Prado Museum several times and it has impressed me every time. When I was at art school in Dijon, one of my professors, Jaume Xifrá, made quite an impact on me. He was Catalan and spoke to me a lot about the Spanish painters.   E.C: Do you believe that there's a dividing line, or at least some difference between the Chinese artists that left China after the Cultural Revolution and those that stayed?Y.P.M: There are differences between the artists that departed and those that remained. Without a doubt, their environments and lifestyles are different and therefore, their work is as well. In regards to myself, I would say that, as of today, I am a nomadic artist without borders. I am just an artist. E.C: Your work deals with war and peace, money and globalization, capitalism and communism, with death as the backdrop. Is this your view of the world?Y.P.M: My view of the world is pretty pessimistic. I don't believe in peace. Since the beginning of man, war has existed and it endures. It makes me think that man will continue fighting until the world is destroyed.Versión en Español. "
16,PARENTS,8 Likely Name Options For The Next Royal Baby -- And 13 Unlikely Ones,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/royal-baby-name_n_6978568.html,,2015-04-01,"LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 27: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge visit The Stephen Lawrence Centre on March 27, 2015 in London, England. (Photo by Mark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a90682a0000d6024f757b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Now that Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, is officially on maternity leave, it seems like a good moment for an update on the current royal baby name expectations and prognostications. Although royal babies are almost always given previously used royal names, William and Kate might find they have a little more wiggle room with this second child. But probably not.Brits are big on betting, and royal offspring tend to incite a tsunami of wagering activity. As of this moment, the odds for the second baby's name heavily favor Alice, which currently stands at 2-1 at bookmaker William Hill , 7-2 at Paddy Power, and 3-1 at Betfair. Alice has impeccable royal credentials, most notably as the name Queen Victoria gave her second daughter. Then there was the present Queen’s aunt, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, who died a decade ago at the age of 102. Not to mention that Alice, with its romantic and sweet storybook aura, is a name everybody loves.Following behind Alice on the top betting sites are Elizabeth, Charlotte -- the wife of George III, Victoria, and Alexandra -- Edward VII’s Queen. This goes against the results of the Corgi race held by the Ladbrokes firm, in which the dog labeled Alexandra was the winner. As for the boys, Arthur, Henry and James are running a close race, all at 20-1 odds set by William Hill, while Paddy Power has Philip at 25-1. There have been two King Jameses of the United Kingdom and seven in Scotland -- which would surely win it points north of the border. Arthur is a popular middle name in the royal family, worn as such by both Prince William and his father.It’s always fun to take a look at some of the names with the worst odds on Betfair, BetVictor, Coral and Ladbrokes. This time around we have Stephanie at 80-1, Camilla at 100-1 (indeed), Aldona at 250-1, Chardonnay and Mercedes at 500-1; Trevor at 100-1, Joffrey at 250-1, Raheem, Ringo, Macbeth and Sepp at 500-1 and Wayne and Derek at 1000-1. Additional odds have been given for the baby's hair color, the day of birth and the date. The Coral agency is offering 3-1 odds that the color Kate will be wearing as she leaves the hospital is blue.News of the baby’s birth will be delivered via a bulletin taken from the hospital to Buckingham Palace, where it will be placed on an easel at the palace gates. It will state the time of birth, gender and birth. But we’ll probably have to wait with bated breath for a few days for the announcement of the name.

But this array of unexpected incongruities is now my favorite aspect of this desert city that venerates the exotic. On this Friday evening, I am going in search of the nearest experience to visiting the great African plains that can be found in Las Vegas.As I arrive at Rotella Gallery inside the marble atrium of The Forum Shops at Caesars, I am just in time to witness the official unveiling of a new large scale work by Scottish photographer David Yarrow. When the cloth is dramatically pulled away, the figures of South Sudanese cattle herders and their horned white beasts are revealed emerging from clouds of mosquito-repelling smoke. In the foreground, a figure balanced on a lookout stand gazes out across the scene, backlit by the white haze. It is a dramatic image of a location rarely visited by outsiders. The recent civil war and the condition of the local roads deter most. But David Yarrow belongs to that rare breed of dedicated photographer willing to take the risks and endure the physical hardships necessary in the pursuit of an image that will stand out in an era of visual overload.Standing in front of the South Sudanese scene, Yarrow describes the journey that led to the photograph. After driving two hundred miles on water-ravaged roads from the South Sudanese capital of Juba, a final waterway had to be crossed on foot, where the odd crocodile had been known to take unlucky travelers. But in this remote area where violence is not uncommon, humans pose more of a threat than the wildlife and at one point Yarrow found himself being interrogated at gunpoint. He noted that while accommodation costs might only be $1 per night, security costs can be more like $1,000 per day. As an aid to bridging the cultural divide, Yarrow brought along photographs of shaggy Scottish Highland cattle, and he recalls the Dinka herders' response was: ""Your cows are crazy cows!"" Another item that generated much local interest was a lightweight aluminum ladder that allowed Yarrow to photograph from a vantage point above his subjects, silhouetting details against the smoke. Yarrow tells us he is always looking for the perfect combination of angle, light and composition that will allow him to achieve his goal of ""one moment of excellence."" His audience laughs when he declares that in this process, he ""takes more bad pictures than the rest of you put together."" This Gaelic charm is no doubt a key ingredient in overcoming all obstacles to achieve the photograph before us. As I head out into twilight on the Las Vegas Strip, although it is not yet summer, I can feel the heat in the dry air. I could almost be on an open plain in South Sudan... almost."

I think they are daffodils, but I planted them too close to the edge of the driveway and they get trampled on before they can bloom. But still... Yay Spring!We've reached that time of year where we are supposed to do something called ""spring cleaning."" I'm under the impression that means we're supposed to clean springs, which seems an enormous waste of time. I mean, we can barely be bothered to change our sheets at reasonable intervals, much less clean the bed springs. Besides, we have one of those memory foam beds. There aren't even any springs to clean.Pro tip: If you want to get your spouse to change the sheets, then marry a person with super sensitive skin and eat toast in bed. Turns out, ""spring cleaning"" means we're supposed to clean our whole house. Yes, the whole house.Judgey types frown upon cutting corners. Cutting corners causes horrible things to happen and proves that you are lazy and you want to watch the world burn. Then this new concept popped up! Life hacks! Life hacks are the things smart people do to save time and energy but are in no way the same thing as cutting corners.Spring Cleaning Life Hacks:1. Before cleaning your refrigerator, do the 'zombie sniff test'. I am not suggesting you find a zombie and have the zombie smell your skanky fridge; that is just not safe. The zombie would end up biting you and then drink milk out of the carton. What I suggest is that you sniff your fridge. Unless the fridge smells like a zombie storage unit, then you can put off cleaning a little longer.2. Leave cleaning supplies scattered throughout your home. When people stop by, you looks like they've interrupted you in the middle of cleaning. There is a downside to this, though. If you are constantly looking at unused cleaning supplies, they start getting smug. Then accusatory. Before long, you will find yourself screaming at your dust buster to stop judging you.3. Recently, I read a brilliant cleaning life hack. You attach little scrubbers to an old pair of shoes and scrub the floor while you walk. Perfect. If I attached little scrubbers to my old shoes and then attempted to walk on soapy soles, I would slip and fall within seconds. Then, because I'd be injured, someone else would have to do all the cleaning. By someone else, I mean my husband.4. Use your mini blinds like a mood ring. Remember mood rings? Apparently, my mood always made them turn green. But we aren't talking about that, we're talking about your disgusting mini blinds. Go look at the mini-blinds and then gauge your mood. Are they so dirty that your mood takes a downward swing? Does looking at your mini blinds make you feel hopeless and like everything you touch turns to shit? Do you feel like drinking bourbon and then drunk dialing old therapists after looking at your blinds? Do what I did. Take them down. Throw them away. Never, ever buy new ones.5. There's the putting a lazy Susan in your refrigerator hack. Which seems genius because when shit spills, the lazy Susan will be easier to remove than the fridge shelves. Also, why do we call them lazy Susans? That hardly seems fair to Susan. Why couldn't it be a ""saves some time, Susan"" or a ""thing the kids will spin around until stuff falls off Susan""?6. Some tasks can be completely avoided by changing certain aspects about your self. For instance, it's much easier to claim to be a person who ""never wears jewelry"" than getting all the knots out of the necklaces.Do you often feel uptight? Wouldn't it be nice to be one of those women who not only claims to not care what anyone else thinks of them but actually one who doesn't care what anyone thinks of them? Just do that! Stop caring what other people think about you. Are you basically a slob? OK then! Live your life. Who cares what anyone thinks?7. I have not achieved that level of freedom. However, I do adopt that attitude when it comes to my baseboards. I do not care how dusty they are. My best life hack for spring cleaning will save you hours and hours. Do what I do. I can clean an entire room by closing a door.This post is nothing more than a desperate effort to continue putting off all but the most basic of cleaning. I have been doing that for months now, y'all. I'm not even sure if my refrigerator would pass the zombie sniff test.Guess it's time to put on those rubber shoe scrubber slippers.

Check the terms and conditions of your potential reservation before you unwittingly agree to pay for something you may not want.On Monday, in Condé Nast Traveler's ""Morning News,"" Paul Brady noted the following, as reported in the LA Times:""[Benjamin Brin], a traveler stung by a $28-a-night resort fee at the Palazzo in Las Vegas has filed suit alleging 'that the resort is guilty of false and misleading advertising for failing to clearly disclose a mandatory resort fee at the time that he booked the room,' Hugo Martin writes.""If there's one thing I've seen too much of as the Ombudsman, it's fine print; but I couldn't resist the opportunity to check out the Palazzo's reservation process to see how much disclosure is on offer. First, I searched for a room. I arrived at the ""Select Rates & Suites"" page, where I found a number of rate choices, but no mention of a resort fee. When I clicked, ""Select Offer,"" the offer expanded and showed suite options. At the bottom of each option, in small print, it read, ""Rates do not include a resort fee of $29 plus applicable tax per night, payable upon check-in."" Then there's a little ""i"" symbol, which, when clicked, takes you to:""Rates do not include a resort fee of $29 plus applicable tax per night, payable upon check-in. For full description of the amenities included in the Resort Fee, please refer to the offer Terms & Conditions on the Reservation & Payment Details page.""Has the fee now been fully disclosed? You might say yes. I'm not so sure. Let's finish the process before we make a final determination. Next, I clicked ""Book,"" and off to the Reservation & Payment page I went (after a brief stint on an upgrade page--I upgraded, because, what the heck, this is for research purposes, might as well live large in my mind). I then clicked the ""Terms & Conditions"" link. As expected, it was not scintillating reading, but here's what it said about the resort fee:""Rates do not include a resort fee of $29 plus applicable tax per night, payable upon check-in. The Resort Fee includes:""Access for two to the fitness facility within the Canyon Ranch SpaClub®, in-suite internet access (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), boarding pass printing, unlimited local and toll-free calls, daily newspaper, a complimentary coffee or tea at Café Presse, and one two-for-one drink coupon for well drinks, domestic beer or wine at any casino bar excluding The Bourbon Room (must be 21 or older to redeem drink coupon).""The Resort Fee is not reflected in the grand total quoted on your reservation. If you have questions about the Resort Fee, please inquire with the Front Desk Agent upon check-in.""While we have now seen three times that the resort fee is not included in the room rate, it still seems somewhat lacking in transparency, because I don't know if the fee is mandatory (although we know from the lawsuit that it is). What if I don't want the items included in it? Maybe I don't care about my fitness. I may use my phone's data plan for access to the internet, which I can also use to download my boarding pass (is this really part of the resort fee?). And, uh, again, I have my own phone; free calls are useless to me. I'll be in Vegas, so I may not care about the news for a few days, but even if I do, you guessed it, I have my own phone, with access to lots of newspapers (I still prefer to read my newspaper as a broadsheet, but this is a hypothetical exercise). I'd also be willing to bet I could buy a coffee (at a coffeehouse with free Wi-Fi access) and a drink for less than $29. So, Front Desk Agent, I don't want to pay the resort fee. ""Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir, but you must.""An article at Legal Newsline gives a bit more detail about the possible misrepresentation of prices at the Palazzo:""The lawsuit alleged Las Vegas Sands [owner of the Palazzo] uses a dip pricing technique, which was recently addressed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Dip pricing occurs when a company advertises only a portion of a product's true price, and then adds additional fees later when the customer goes to pay for the product.""Okay, let's step back for a minute and look at the larger picture. Resort fees and other add-ons, some optional, have become ubiquitous. Personally, as you may have gleaned, I'm not in favor of them, particularly when they aren't transparent. If you want to compare room to room, hotel to hotel, they force you to pay attention to the fine print too early in the process. So for now, at least until Benjamin Brin's class action works its way through the courts, put on your reading glasses for some eight point font. And if a hotel refers to a resort fee, unless it's clear that it's optional, assume it's mandatory.More from Condé Nast Traveler: These Are The Best Cities in the World 15 Places You Won't Believe Exist The World's Most Dangerous Trips Private Islands That Cost Less Than an NYC Apartment How Not to Look Like a Tourist In Paris 10 Most Underrated American Cities"
