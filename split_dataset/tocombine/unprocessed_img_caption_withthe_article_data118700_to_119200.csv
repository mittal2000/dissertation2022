Israel rejected them. Rather than make public this framework and thereby hope the Israeli public would pressure its right-wing government to compromise, the Obama administration instead insisted that ""both sides"" had shown a lack of will to compromise.An interview in an Israeli publication with an anonymous U.S. official close to the peace talks confirmed numerous other reports that, despite the Obama administration's claims to the contrary, the Palestinian side made major concessions while the Israeli side essentially refused to make any, generally refusing to talk about any substantive issues.A host of Democratic and Republican former officials -- including a former national security adviser, secretary of defense, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, trade representative, and undersecretary of state for political affairs -- went on record arguing that the Obama administration would have to challenge the Israeli government's hard line toward the Palestinians in order for the peace process to be successful. Unfortunately, the White House apparently had no interest in doing so.Instead, Washington has focused on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' refusal to give in to U.S. and Israeli demands that he recognize Israel as a ""Jewish state."" While the Palestinian government, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the ruling Fatah party have all recognized the state of Israel for more than 20 years, the Obama administration has effectively moved the goalposts by declaring that recognizing the Israeli government, acknowledging its right to exist, and providing security guarantees is not enough, insisting that the Palestinians explicitly recognize the state of Israel's ethno-religious identity as well. No previous administration has put forward such a requirement. President Carter never made such demands of Egypt, nor did President Clinton require this of Jordan as a condition for their peace treaties with Israel. Abbas has said that Israel can identify itself however it wants, but -- given that 20 percent of the Israeli population is ethnically Palestinian Arab -- it would be politically impossible to agree to something that would acknowledge second-class status for other Palestinians.Never in history has any country been required to recognize the ethnic or religious identity of another state as a condition for peace. It appears, then, that the Obama administration's demand may have been an effort to destroy any chance of a peace agreement and leave an opening to blame the Palestinians -- despite their agreement to virtually every other issue -- for the failure of the peace process.The failure may also come from President Obama's trusting Secretary of State John Kerry, a longtime supporter of the Israeli right, to play such a key role in the peace talks. In 2004 Kerry unconditionally endorsed an Israeli plan to unilaterally and illegally annex large areas of the West Bank, leaving the Palestinians with only a series of small, non-contiguous cantons surrounded by Israel as their ""state,"" a proposal denounced worldwide as a violation of the UN Charter, a series of UN Security Council resolutions, and basic principles of international law. Indeed, Kerry has long insisted that it was ""unrealistic"" to demand an Israeli withdrawal from its occupied territories. (By contrast, Kerry has demanded that Russia withdraw completely from Crimea, citing the illegality of any country acquiring ""part or all of another state's territory through coercion or force."")Palestinian ReactionRecognizing the failure of the United States to be an honest broker, the Palestinian government has been seeking to enhance its diplomatic leverage by redoubling its efforts to be recognized as a full state and acceding to a series of international conventions. The Obama administration and Congress have strongly condemned these moves, insisting that while Israel is free to join various international conventions addressing human rights and international law (despite the current right-wing government's failure to uphold many of its required obligations), Palestine has no right to join these same conventions. In early April, Kerry cancelled scheduled peace talks with Abbas in protest of the Palestinian government's efforts to join the Geneva and Vienna Conventions and UN agencies dealing with women's and children's rights.As an indication of just how extreme U.S. Middle East policy has become, the administration has described Palestine's efforts to join these 15 international conventions addressing human rights and international law as ""a threat to Israel."" In reality, none of these conventions impacts Israel in any way. The Obama administration insists that allowing for any application of international humanitarian law -- even Palestinian ratification of human rights treaties that would help end torture or attacks on civilians by Palestinians -- would somehow interfere with the peace negotiations. As Bill van Esveld of Human Rights Watch observed, ""[b]y blocking accountability in the name of advancing the peace process, the U.S. has facilitated the settlements and other war crimes that are undermining the prospects for peace.""The contempt the administration has for human rights could not be better illustrated than in a recent speech by Martin Indyk, Obama's special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, in which he criticized the Palestinian government's ""supposed pursuit of 'justice' and their 'rights,'"" in an apparent effort to ridicule the very notion. The words ""justice"" and ""rights"" are in quotation marks in the official transcript, and a video shows him making quote marks with his fingers.In another move decried by U.S. officials, Fatah and Hamas announced the formation of a unity government in order to prepare for elections next year. Though no Hamas officials will serve in any cabinet posts, and though President Abbas has reiterated Palestine's commitment to a two-state solution and to all previous agreements, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki defended Israel's decision to suspend the talks by saying, ""It's hard to see how Israel can be expected to negotiate with a government that does not believe in its right to exist.""Ironically, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party still rejects a two-state solution, and his cabinet includes parties even further to the right -- including HaBayit HaYehudi, or ""Jewish Home,"" which essentially mirrors Hamas in rejecting previous disengagement agreements and refusing to accept Palestine's right to exist, with a prominent member of the party even having been accused of stoking attacks against Palestinian civilians. However, the Obama administration apparently believes that while anti-Israel extremism in unacceptable, anti-Palestinian extremism can be tolerated.Meanwhile, a broad bipartisan effort is growing in the Congress to blame the failure of the peace talks exclusively on the Palestinians and to force the administration to cut all ties with the Palestine Authority.Unless and until the Obama administration decides to end its support for the Israeli right and support Israeli and Palestinian moderates, there will be no hope for peace.An earlier version of this blog post appeared in Foreign Policy in Focus."
1,QUEER VOICES,A Celebration Of Judy Garland And LGBT Youth,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/night-of-a-thousand-judys-2014_n_5454908.html,,2014-06-10,JUDY GARLAND -- Pictured: Judy Garland -- Photo by: NBCU Photo Bank,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc8283c000066000ba164.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The worlds of Broadway, folk-rock, television and downtown cabaret will unite once again for “Night of a Thousand Judys,” honoring homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth as well as the legacy of Judy Garland. Now it its fourth year, “Night of a Thousand Judys” will feature performances by Broadway’s Rory O’Malley and Sierra Boggess along with “Queer as Folk” star Randy Harrison and singer-songwriter Erin McKeown. Also making their “Judys” debut at the June 16 event are Austin Scarlett of “Project Runway,” jazz violinist Aaron Weinstein and singer Jane Monheit, among others. As in previous years, ""Night of a Thousand Judys"" -- which is a special presentation of New York-based actor, writer and performer Justin Sayre's variety show “The Meeting” and timed to coincide with Pride Month -- will benefit the Ali Forney Center, a New York advocacy group dedicated to homeless LGBT teens and young adults.“The show has really become an event, something each of us on the team look forward to every year,” Sayre, who’s also a HuffPost Gay Voices blogger, said. “But more so than any of the specifics, it becomes a celebration of this iconic performer that we all adore. At the core of what makes Judy Garland great is her vulnerability.”He then added, “Every song is a master class in giving.” The Huffington Post spoke with three of the evening’s performers about their favorite Judy Garland moments. Check out what they had to share below. Erin McKeown: ""I’m a big fan of the stuff from her TV shows. I’m a complete sucker for the 'Get Happy/Happy Days Are Here Again' duet with Barbra Streisand. I think it's just one of the most amazing pieces of music and performances by [two female artists] that I’ve ever seen. I feel like I learned how to be a performer by watching her. There was something about the way she carried herself onstage that made a lot of sense to me. I felt aligned with her … I think a lot of people associate her with the pathos involved with her later career. I recognize that's an important part of her mythology, but I don’t hang that on her. I just see someone who’s incredibly musical and incredibly dedicated to telling a story, whether that’s in a three-minute song or a two-hour movie musical.""Sarah Dash: ""When she did ‘The Wizard of Oz’…there she was, a young teenager singing ‘Over The Rainbow’…the meaning of that song came from her heart and her soul. We all want that rainbow.Judy was classy, she was troubled…but she still stood for what was right in her own way. She was a singer who, like Sarah Vaughan, didn’t have technical things to help her along. She sang from the heart. She had her troubles and her marriages, but…her soul gave her her gift. I’m sure if she were here today, she’d be standing alongside people like Elton John, fighting for humanity and human rights, and particularly for this group of youth who are still developing and coming into adulthood. She’d be doing this benefit!"" Austin Scarlett: ""A lot of Judy fans tend to really focus in on her later concert career. But I love the sheer, pure optimism and all-American ‘let’s put on a show’ feel of her early films with Mickey Rooney. I think Judy taught us all to dream in Technicolor. She is the embodiment of our childhood, and the poignancy of her later career just adds to the enigma around her. In ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ she befriends these outcasts, these misfits…as gay people, we’ve all felt like misfits at one time or another, and to know that we potentially could have been friends of Dorothy…is part of her whole charm and appeal. I’m sure Judy will be proud and looking down at us from her rainbow in the sky, smiling."" “Night of a Thousand Judys” will take place at Merkin Concert Hall at the Kaufman Center in New York on June 16.

4,WOMEN,Where the Boys Are: A Challenge to Snapchat's CEO,"Donna Wick, Ed.D, ContributorClinical psychologist and founder, Mind to Mind Parent",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-challenge-to-snapchats-ceo_b_5469990.html,It's no longer acceptable to condemn individual behavior without looking at the culture that protects and promotes it.,2014-06-09,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - SEPTEMBER 09: Evan Spiegel of Snapchat attends TechCruch Disrupt SF 2013 at San Francisco Design Center on September 9, 2013 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fa83200000e80000f20a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's good to know that Snapchat’s 23-year-old CEO, Evan Spiegel, is not the same person he was three years ago.This is reassuring for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that 20-year-old Evan's emails to his Stanford University frat brothers at Kappa Sigma, published last week by the Gawker Media Valleywag blog, are nauseatingly mysognistic. The one that garnered the most attention describes being so drunk that he urinated on a girl in his bed, but they are all worthy of note. Here's but one example:So, give yourself a pat on the back or have some girl put your large kappa sigma d**k down her throat because you f*****g HANDLED this weekend. Can’t wait to see everyone on the blackout express soon, evanBut as Spiegel says, those emails, ""in no way reflect who I am today or my views toward women."" Phew! That is enormously reassuring, as he controls a multibillion-dollar company, used by millions of adolescents daily. Of course, this means that in addition to all his other accomplishments, he’s achieved the fastest developmental arc in history. In three short years, he evolved from a well... whatever to a well-adjusted adult male. Awesome job, Evan!Given the great irony of the situation (Spiegel is, of course, the ideal Snapchat user), I am a bit surprised by the lack of media attention this has garnered. There have been a few calls for him to step down, and Amanda Bennet wrote a great article in the Washington Post. But considering the current attention to sexual assault cases in colleges and universities, I would have expected Spiegel's rants to create more of an uproar. After all, those emails were sent to all his frat brothers, suggesting some consensus with his views, or at the very least, no overt disagreement. In other words, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that any of his fellow Kappa Sig bros stepped forward to say, ""Dude, do you really think it's cool to get so drunk that you pee on a woman?""Anyone remember the Duke Lacrosse scandal? All members of that team were acquitted of the charges, but the media coverage exposed a culture that made it easy to condemn their attitudes, if not their actions. Ryan McFayden, a member of the Duke lacrosse team who reportedly had to eventually change his name to get a job, sent out a whopper of an email:To whom it may concern. Tommorrow (sic) night, after tonights show, ive decided to have some strippers over to edens 2c, all are welcome. however there will be no nudity. I plan on killing the bitches as soon as the(y) walk in and proceeding to cut their skin off while cumming in duke issue spandex...Sorry about that, but it's important to actually read, or reread, the viciousness of those words. McFayden claims that his email was actually a riff on American Psycho. He maintained his intentions were harmless: ""You send something like that to 40 guys and you don't think about it. So that was me. I was just making a joke about that night. I sent it off and that was it.""Strangely, I do not find this reassuring. Some of his more cultured lacrosse teammates evidently got the joke, suggesting that there was group knowledge and appreciation of the values of the narrator in American Psycho. I doubt that anyone responded with, ""Do we really have to kill them and cut off their skin?""When John Danowski was hired to replace outgoing and disgraced Duke lacrosse coach Mike Pressler, he worked hard to change the culture of the team. Interestingly, he blamed the team's behavior the previous year on summer internships on Wall Street. Danowski said:They are around 40 and 50-year-old men all summer. During that time they see that for those men, hiring strippers and dancers is acceptable behavior. But the rules of private behavior on Wall Street are different than the rules at college. I'm teaching guys values every day. I'm holding them accountable to their teammates. These guys have great futures ahead of them. They're the next masters of the universe.Notwithstanding Danowski’s efforts to teach values, he's not reassuring me either. This is ""acceptable behavior” for 40- and 50-year-old men? Does the culture of Wall Street corrupt elite athletes, or do they become misogynistic much earlier, in sports teams and in fraternities? But Danowski is right about what happens next: Duke lacrosse players and Stanford fraternity brothers do grow up to become the next masters of the universe.And that's everybody's problem. Stanford fraternities, a multibillion-dollar company, big-time college athletics, Wall Street bankers -- no one can argue that this isn't the establishment. These email chains provide evidence of what we on the outside have long suspected: how unthinkingly violent and misogynistic these outposts of entitled all-male culture can be. I can hear my husband and male friends saying, ""Not me, not all men, a few bad apples,"" and certainly, not all college sports teams nor fraternities can be judged by these emails. A good friend of mine has a son on the current Duke lacrosse team, and she tells me that Danowski has indeed changed the culture of the lacrosse team, providing leadership and demanding integrity, discipline, and loyalty on and off the field. But the fact is that we can and do judge a team, be it a sports team, a fraternity, or the boys club of Wall Street, by the behavior of a few bad apples. And we know too much. It’s no longer acceptable to condemn individual behavior without looking at the culture that protects and promotes it.Stanford Provost John Etchemendy made this point in his excellent address to the Stanford community about the Spiegel scandal, when he called upon the recipients of these emails to take responsibility, and “affirmatively reject” them, especially when they come from friends. Finally, this is reassuring. And so is the fact that in my clinical practice, I hear parents becoming more critical consumers of higher education. Deeply worried about the current college culture of binge drinking and boorish behavior, they are contemplating taking schools “off the list,” even if they are elite colleges and universities. Especially if they have daughters. So, Evan, if you’re really not the same jerk you were three years ago, let’s see how your views toward women have evolved. Put your money where your mouth is. Join the fight against violence and sexual assault on women at colleges, at universities and, finally and especially, in fraternities. Here’s a place to start."
5,ARTS,'Hedwig' Takes Home Tony For Best Revival Of A Musical,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hedwig-and-the-angry-inch_n_5470785.html,,2014-06-09,Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Play -- Mark Rylance in 'Twelfth Night',https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2730c250000cf00386cce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Cue giant sigh of relief, popping of champagne bottles and application of heavy face glitter. Cult punk opera ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" won the 2014 Tony Award for Best Revival Of A Musical! ""Hedwig"" tells the oh-so glamorous tale of a song stylist whose gender transition introduces audiences to a raucous journey of self-discovery. The musical, adapted from John Cameron Mitchell's original story and featuring music and lyrics by Stephen Trask, debuted at New York's Jane Street Theatre in 1998. The boundary-pushing performance quickly became a cult hit, but its fringe subject matter and unorthodox musical stylings made it an unlikely Broadway favorite. Yet, in 2001 Hedwig's sparkling quest went from the off-Broadway stage to the silver screen in a film directed by Mitchell (who was also the movie's star). It was nominated for a Golden Globe and awarded Best Feature Film at the Berlin International Film Festival. The New York Times' Stephen Holden said of the film, ""In such a climate the Hedwigs of this world are beginning to seem less like freaks and more like brave individualists mapping out an emerging frontier where boys can be girls and girls can be boys, and everyone has the freedom to couple however he or she chooses. If the glam-rock era is long gone, 'Hedwig' reminds us, its subversive spirit, which has percolated under the surface of rock culture for more than two decades, lives on.""The final phase of Hedwig's pop culture takeover came with its April 2014 Broadway premiere, directed by Michael Mayer and starring ""How I Met Your Mother"" star Neil Patrick Harris. Harris, who has hosted the Tony Awards four times over, made the beloved role his own, channeling the spirits of Bowie and Beyonce in an unbelievably charming display. ""Playing an 'internationally ignored song stylist' of undefinable gender in 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch,' Mr. Harris is in full command of who he is and, most excitingly, what he has become with this performance,"" lauded the New York Times' Ben Brantley. ""That’s a bona fide Broadway star, the kind who can rule an audience with the blink of a sequined eyelid."" Harris took home the Tony for Best Actor in a Musical along with co-star Lena Hall, who won Best Actress for her role as drag king Yitzhak.Congratulations to the cast and crew of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" on a well-deserved victory. We know Broadway marquises are so often plastered with adaptations of Hollywood blockbusters and revivals of traditional classics. But when a punk opera about gender fluidity takes home the big Tony, it's a good day for musical theater.See the other winners from tonight's awards ceremony here: "

Michel Platini, president of European football's governing body, was on June 3, 2014 dragged into the FIFA corruption row after Britain's Daily Telegraph claimed he met secretly with the Qatari official at the heart of the claims. The Telegraph claims to have evidence that the UEFA chief held a private meeting with Mohamed Bin Hamman, a former FIFA vice president who the Sunday Times alleges paid more than $5 million to football officials around the world before the 2010 vote that awarded the tournament to Qatar. FIFA president Sepp Blatter refused to answer journalists' questions on new allegations of corruption.

And upon its conclusion in mid-July, Brazil will begin a sprint to make Rio de Janeiro ready to host the 2016 Summer Olympics. But while earning the right to host two of the international sporting world’s marquee events in such rapid succession may seem like a boon for Brazil on the surface, it might make more sense to have considerable concern. After all, that’s an awful long period of time for one nation to spend in the company of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). While these two organizations front as generous cultural elites bringing the light of peace and economic health to the world through athletic competitions, they are actually gangs of blackguards, as corrupt as they come. In recent months, the long-whispered nature of these organizations is finally, in a number of ways, starting to be spoken of more loudly. And fissures in their relationships to a world of sports fans and the nations in which they reside are starting to form. International sports is having a moment, and it’s not a moment of glory. Unless you imagine a pack of humiliated jackals stewing in their own graft and incompetence to be somehow glorious.That FIFA and the IOC are vice-ridden gangs is well documented. Back in 2006, Scottish investigative reporter Andrew Jennings shone a harsh light on FIFA’s double-dealing in reporting that went on to form the basis of a 2006 Panorama special titled “The Beautiful Bung: Corruption and the World Cup,” and a book, Foul!: The Secret World of Fifa: Bribes, Vote Rigging and Ticket Scandals. Jennings subsequently migrated to exposing the IOC for similar degeneracy. Returning to FIFA in his most recent publication, 2014’s Omerta, Jennings says that “the leadership of FIFA, under Brazil’s João Havelange and now Sepp Blatter, tick all the boxes defining an Organised Crime Syndicate.”Outside of the media that exists within the Sports-Entertainment-Corporate Branding Complex, no one even questions the notion that these organizations are packed with petty thugs and grifters. In 2012, Chris Lehmann wrote a piece for New York magazine that described the extent to which the IOC had become a “mobbed-up oligarchy” stuck on an infinite loop of defilement:[Belgian Count Jacques] Rogge was groomed as the successor to the Games’s long-running chieftain Don Juan Antonio Samaranch y Torelló, First Marquis of Samaranch, Grandee of Spain, a former sporting official with the fascist government of Francisco Franco who managed to reinvent himself as a global ambassador of sport with the large-scale financial backing of Adidas shoe mogul Horst Dassler. Mr. Samaranch oversaw a stunning litany of corruption in his two decades on the job -- encouraging influence peddling, arranging sinecures for family members and cronies of committee members, and padding the I.O.C. board with fellow authoritarians and baksheesh impresarios. In his more expansive moments, Samaranch would also grace vicious dictators like Romania’s Nicolae Ceacescu with awards for their alleged contributions to international sport. When an HBO interviewer confronted Mr. Samaranch on this latter trespass, he curtly replied that he was “very proud” of Ceaucescu’s garland, adding that the I.O.C.’s judgment was not to be questioned because “we are more important than the Catholic religion.”FIFA has always found itself knee-deep in the same brackish waters as the IOC. In Lehman’s piece, he describes how former FIFA head Joao Havelange, having landed with the IOC, washed out with that organization after he became enmeshed in a massive bribery scandal. Also enmeshed: Current FIFA head Sepp Blatter. But as Jennings reported for The Nation earlier this year, Blatter managed to survive that scandal. He shows up in Jennings’ piece posing in a picture with another crowd of “mobbed-up oligarchs,” the current gang running the IOC.FIFA is back in the news this week due to a Sydney Morning Herald story that described how former President Bill Clinton, the honorary chairman of the U.S. bid for the 2022 World Cup, was so angry at FIFA’s decision to award the cup to Qatar that upon returning to his hotel room, “he reached for an ornament on a table and threw it at a wall mirror in a fit of rage, shattering the glass.” Per the Sydney Morning Herald:Clinton, the honorary chairman of the US bid, had wheeled out such big-hitters as Brad Pitt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Morgan Freeman and Spike Lee to add lustre to the US Soccer Federation bid. Australia and Japan's bids had seemed the biggest threat, but few had seriously entertained the idea that Qatar, a footballing desert, could win.Obviously, the game has changed from that time that a World Cup-bidding nation could simply flatter FIFA’s ruling grandees with exclusive access to Benjamin Button -- something that obviously caught Clinton by surprise. Also surprising: The fact that the eventual winner was soccer mediocrity and stadium-bereft Qatar, a nation whose standard, desert temperatures stand out as a solid argument against staging an international soccer tournament. According to a bombshell report from the Sunday Times, Qatar managed to secure the cup thanks to, among other things, $5 million in bribes funneled to various officials by former FIFA VP Mohammed Bin Hammam. (The Times piece is subscription-only; here’s a summary from the BBC.)It’s worth noting that at the time FIFA decided to award the cup to Qatar, the group's 24-member executive committee was down to 22 members because “two members were caught trying to sell their votes to undercover journalists.” And in the wake of the Sunday Times’ allegations, FIFA has floated the notion that it might call backsies: “If corruption is proven,” said the obviously hopeful FIFA VP Michel Platini, “it will take a new vote and sanctions.”An enraged Bill Clinton going on a tchotchke-hurling rampage over losing the chance to host a soccer tournament is a strange thing to imagine. (For what it’s worth, a Clinton spokesperson has denied the part of this report where he gives a hotel mirror a Dean Baquet-style thrashing.) Of all the places that some international grifters could have established a Marvel Team-Up, international sports would seem to be a fairly safe space. It’s not exactly the flamboyant debauch of the global petrochemical industry that Ken Silverstein describes in his book, The Secret World Of Oil. This is just sports, right? As Grantland’s Brian Phillips remarks about l’affaire Qatar, “there’s something deeply silly about many of the organization’s Machiavellian twists.”But Qatar’s misadventures in gearing up for the 2022 World Cup are proving to be far from silly. In fact, if the nation's World Cup bid has accomplished anything, it’s been to shine a light on the lives of the migrant workers who toil in destitution in the oil-rich nation. In a pair of stories, the Guardian reports that 400 Nepalese workers and over 500 Indian workers have died in Qatar’s rush to build the infrastructure necessary for the World Cup. Deadspin’s Barry Petchesky follows on:Together, those two countries provide an estimated 38 percent of the 1.2 million migrant workers currently in Qatar, so you do the math—our headline wouldn't have been out of place in using ""thousands.""It’s not known if Bill Clinton has destroyed any additional hotel furniture as a result of these reports.Even if we excuse these circumstances as unique to Qatar, it’s important to remember how things like the World Cup and the Olympics are sold -- as a booming tide of potential restorative economic growth for the hosts. As The Nation’s Dave Zirin told Amy Goodman, “The problem is that first [former President of Brazil Luiz Inácio] Lula [da Silva] and then [current President] Dilma [Rousseff] told the country very explicitly that the World Cup was not just going to be a soccer tournament; it was going to walk hand in hand with even more developments, more money, more employment, more opportunity for people.”As Al Jazeera reported, the reality is quite different:Many in Brazil's middle class are unhappy with the effects the World Cup has already had on their lives. The cost of living has risen in the cities hosting the games, traffic jams have worsened, and a construction boom aimed at improving urban mobility has only compounded problems, they say.And the Guardian’s Simon Jenkins notes that this is par for the course:Fifa's claim is that host countries benefit from its blessings. The audit on South Africa's 2010 World Cup showed it cost the taxpayers £3bn for a return of £323m and an economic slump. This month's extravaganza in Brazil, which was pledged to cost the ill-resourced country nothing, has seen state spending on stadiums alone of £2bn, with another £9bn on infrastructure. Qatar is reputed to be spending a staggering £120bn. These sums for a brief sporting festival are obscene, whoever is paying.It’s even more obscene when you consider that very little of what Qatar is spending on the World Cup is slotted to budget line items like, “keeping construction workers alive.”The Olympics, of course, are sold in similar “you’ll benefit from our blessings” fashion, and the promises typically prove to be just as false. As Robert A. Baade and Victor Matheson write in their study, “Bidding For The Olympics: Fools Gold?”: “Diverting scarce capital and other resources from more productive uses to the Olympics very likely translates into slower rates of economic growth than that which could be realized in the absence of hosting the Olympic Games.”Back when Lehmann penned his indictment of the IOC, it looked for all the world as if this lesson would never be learned. In his piece, University of Toronto sociology professor Helen Lenskyj offers this downcast assessment: “The typical pattern in host cities is steep cost overruns ... But the organizations sponsoring the event never learn from that experience.”That may be changing. Deadspin’s Petchesky reported last week that at the moment, the IOC is having a hard time finding a taker for the 2022 Winter Games, and it would seem that the chief reason is that people have wised up. Voters put the kibosh on Switzerland’s bid back in March 2013. Later that year, voters in Germany did the same. This past week, Polish voters followed suit. And the new governing coalition in Sweden offered a pretty blunt account as to why they pulled out of the bidding process: “Arranging a Winter Olympics would mean a big investment in new sports facilities, for example for the bobsleigh and luge ... There isn't any need for that type of that kind of facility after an Olympics.""Petchesky goes on to note that two of the four remaining bids are “in bad shape.” Public sentiment is shifting quickly against the bid of Oslo, Norway. And the last Winter Games host, Russia, having imposed new stratospheric benchmarks for Olympics-related spending on everyone else, has compounded this problem by -- and you may have heard something about this! -- invading Ukraine, which has pretty well imperiled Lviv’s bid for 2022. That leaves China and Caspian petrochemical dictatorship Kazakhstan as the only two contenders not staggered by circumstance or public opposition. As Petchesky summarizes: “When actual citizens are allowed to have a say, they say they don't want the Olympics.”In Brazil, something never thought possible is happening: The people there have turned against the World Cup. Demonstrations have been a common occurrence for well over a year. Brazil’s national team has even been the focus of protests. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that no one’s even pretending that the cup is going to provide some sort of economic benefit. How could they? Those empty promises now live on as unfinished infrastructure projects the dot the nation’s landscape. It’s not like Brazilians have lost their love for the game. In fact, their soccer mania has been put to higher purpose, rechanneled as the fuel for populist demonstration in the form of La Copa Popular (“The People’s Cup”). Featuring players from Brazil’s notoriously destitute favelas, it’s an idea that’s been re-adopted after it was first launched in South Africa.Here in America, the tipping point reached by these reprobate international organizations has not gone unnoticed. As Simon Jenkins notes, “American soccer authorities, to their credit, have said they will not bid for any tournaments until FIFA is reformed.” And this week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the Big Apple was not going to bid for the 2024 Olympics. Considering the fact that staging an Olympic Games would have been wholly antithetical to his goal of making working-class New Yorkers more prosperous, it had to have been one of the easiest decisions he’s yet faced.None of this is to say that the world needs to give up on international sports, or that anyone should disparage the athletes who participate in them. Even Brazil’s La Copa Popular participants plan on watching their national team play. They just won’t be bought off for the slim price of getting to watch Neymar’s heroics up close. Simon Jenkins has urged Britain to lead the way in establishing a new, more virtuous governing body for international soccer. Mark Perryman, in his book, Why the Olympics Aren't Good for Us, and How They Can Be, lays out a way that the Olympics can be truer to their humanitarian rhetoric. And the more that participating officials demand reform from international organizers of these events, the sooner we’ll have athletic competitions in which we can all take pride. Until that day, however, we need to be less innocent to the fact that FIFA and the IOC have simply become havens for scoundrels, and more aware of the fact that their panglossian promise of economic benefit is nothing but a con.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter?
