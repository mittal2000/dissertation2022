HuffPost also",2013-06-15,"NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 09: Rapper Kanye West performs during the 2013 Governor's Ball Music Festival at Randall's Island on June 9, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb42d212200005700dc093f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As anyone would expect, Def Jam is none too pleased about the leaking of Kanye West's ""Yeezus"" -- and the record label is on the hunt for the guilty party. But perhaps as equally unsurprising, West himself is reportedly carefree about the news of the leak, which sparked a firestorm on Twitter and across the Internet upon its outbreak Friday afternoon. The term #Yeezus is still a trending term as of Saturday morning. Sources reportedly tell TMZ that special procedures are in place so Def Jam can track down the sources of leaks when they occur. The label says it already has a lead on the suspect and will seek appropriate consequences. West, on the other hand, remains unfazed, saying he was well aware this may happen, given the album's buzz. His reactions are aligned with comments he made at the beginning of the week during the ""Yeezus"" listening party in New York City.""I have a new strategy, it's called 'no strategy.' I have a plan to sell more music -- it's called 'make better music,'"" he said. ""I had to learn about giving, this whole album is about giving -- this whole process is about giving ... no f--ks at all."" Still, West must realize the leak could impact his album sales come Tuesday, even if his current mantra indicates he is unconcerned with such statistics. Prior to the leak, industry insiders predicted a 500,000-copy debut. That figure is just slightly higher than the number ""Watch the Throne"" -- an album that managed to avoid a leak -- saw when it bowed in 2011. Keith Caulfield, associate director of charts and retail at Billboard, tweeted yesterday in response to Los Angeles Times music writer Todd Martens:.@Toddmartens Everything leaks or streams early. They knew it would happen.The Huffington Post reached out to Caulfield to see if the 500,000 prediction has changed following the leak. HuffPost also asked Def Jam to comment on the matter but has not yet heard back."

The G8, he said, represented ""pure and total evil"".The summit, which will include the first private, face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for a year, will take place at a secluded hotel near Enniskillen.Top of the agenda will be Syria, with Obama facing tough talks with Putin, the government's most powerful ally. Leaders will also consider coordinated global action on tax avoidance and evasion.The Saturday marchers came overwhelmingly from Ireland, north or south. Organisers said many protesters from abroad had been put off by the location of the summit and the reputation of Northern Irish police as among the most militarised in Europe.""There used to be a large number of anti-capitalists who travelled to these protests, but there isn't the appetite now,"" said John Molyneux, 64, a veteran of G8 protests from Dublin.""Now people are more focused on the struggles in their own countries: Greece, Spain, Turkey,"" he said.The next major protest is planned for Monday, the first day of G8 meetings, when activists plan to march to the boundary fence of the security zone outside the hotel near Enniskillen , 80 miles (130 km) west of Belfast.The meeting will bring together the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States, as well as senior European Union officials.At least 100 armoured jeeps were parked in side streets along the protest route and officers took photographs and videos of the protesters. Police formed a human chain outside a city centre McDonalds, whose restaurants have been attacked at previous G8 meetings.Some 3,600 police have been sent from the British mainland to reinforce 4,400 from Northern Ireland protecting the event.Northern Ireland police regularly deal with sectarian rioting involving Catholic youths, who want Northern Ireland to unite with the Republic of Ireland to the south, and Protestants who want to remain part of the United Kingdom.This year, dozens of police were injured during weeks of rioting after a decision to cut the number of days the British flag flies over Belfast city hall, with officers firing plastic bullets and water cannons.Around 50 people draped in Union flags on Saturday held their weekly protest outside city hall calling for the flag to be flown all year round.As well as anti-globalists, police are protecting the venue against the threat of an attack by militants who do not accept the Irish Republican Army's 1998 peace agreement with Britain, which ended three decades of violence.

5,TRAVEL,Great (But Forgotten) Historic Sites Linked to 'Fathers' of Innovation and Social Movements,"Andrew Carroll, Contributor
Author, 'Here Is Where: Discovering America's Great Forgotten ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fathers-day-historic-sites_us_5b9d4319e4b03a1dcc860ce7,"In honor of this Father's Day, I picked out my ten favorite ""forgotten places"" and the extraordinary individuals to whom they're somehow connected.",2013-06-14,2013-06-14-1b.PhiloFarnsworthAptBldg.Holloywood.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-06-14-1b.PhiloFarnsworthAptBldg.Holloywood.jpg,"While traveling across the country to research my latest book, Here Is Where: Discovering America's Great Forgotten History (Crown), I was on the look-out for historic sites that are nationally significant and yet unmarked and virtually unknown. I was especially surprised by how many of these places were linked to great ""fathers"" of various innovations, inventions, and social movements. So, in honor of this Father's Day, I picked out my ten favorite ""forgotten places"" and the extraordinary individuals to whom they're somehow connected.1. Philo Farnsworth's Farm Rigby, Idaho Farnsworth, ""the father of television,"" was 14 years old when the idea for TV came to him on this rural farm in 1921. There's also his apartment on North New Hampshire Street in Hollywood where he conducted the first experiments that led to the invention of t.v., and that building is also unmarked.2. H.H. Hay Drugstore Portland, Maine In front of this building, which was a drugstore in the early 1800s, local resident Neal Dow saw an inebriated child begging for money. Already a teetotaler, Dow decided then and there to dedicate his life to the prohibition of alcohol, and when he became Portland's mayor in 1851, he helped push through a major prohibition law that other states would later copy. The ""father of the Prohibition movement,"" Neal Dow was also called the ""Napoleon of Temperance,"" due to his short stature and tenacious manner.3. William Morrison's Laboratory Des Moines, Iowa The first car in America was invented by William Morrison in 1890, years before Henry Ford introduced his Model T to the general public. What's even more extraordinary is that Morrison's car was electric; the first cars in the U.S. were powered by batteries, not fuel.4. Elisha Otis's Birthplace Halifax, Vermont Called ""the father of the modern elevator,"" it was Elisha Otis who invented the elevator safety brake that prevented ""lifts"" from plummeting. Before Otis's time, few buildings were larger than three or four stories. (People didn't want to walk much higher than that, and no one trusted the old ""lifts."") Because of Otis's invention, skyscrapers began appearing all over the world.5. Caledonia Correctional Facility Caledonia, North Carolina A former bootlegger, David Williams was an inmate at Caledonia when he invented (with the warden's permission) the M1 Carbine, a rifle that revolutionized warfare in the 1940s. According to General Douglas MacArthur, the M1 was a huge factor in helping U.S. troops win the Pacific campaign during WWII.6. Ralph Teetor's Home Laboratory Hagerstown, Indiana Ralph Teetor is ""the father of cruise control,"" and what makes Teetor so remarkable is that he invented cruise control in his basement laboratory in 1958, despite the fact that he was completely blind. (No photo available; this is still a private residence.)7. Nikola Tesla's Final Residence/The New Yorker Hotel New York, New York Guglielmo Marconi was initially named ""the father of radio,"" and he won the patent for it in 1903. But the Supreme Court reversed the decision in 1943 and said that Nikola Tesla was the true ""father of radio."" Sadly, Tesla had died months earlier penniless and alone in the New Yorker Hotel.8. Maurice Hilleman's Birthplace Miles City, Montana Hilleman is virtually unknown, but he is the inventor of almost half of all the vaccines that most of us receive in life. Hilleman never named the vaccines he discovered after himself (he did name the ""Jeryl Lynn"" mumps vaccine after his daughter, but, out of modesty, he specifically kept their last name off), and his vaccines are believed to have saved tens of millions of lives.9. North Hall Dormitory University of Wisconsin, Madison According to his own autobiography, it was outside this dormitory that John Muir -- the ""father of the environmental movement"" (and founder of the Sierra Club) -- had his epiphany to spend his life in nature and promote the importance of preserving the great outdoors.10. Robert Goddard's Backyard Worcester, Massachusetts Although Wernher von Braun is often called ""the father of America's space program,"" von Braun himself said that Goddard preceded him and was the real pioneer. Goddard, at the mere age of 16, had his vision of sending rockets into space while sitting in a tree in the backyard of his childhood home in Worcester. He went on to create the patents for the first multi-stage booster rockets, and the rest, as they say, is history...For more information or to recommend your own favorite historic site that has gone overlooked and unmarked, visit: www.HereIsWhere.org."
