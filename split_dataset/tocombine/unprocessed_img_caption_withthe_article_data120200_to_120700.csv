0,POLITICS,Pelosi Will Hit The Road To Rally Single Women Voters,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pelosi-hits-the-road-to-r_n_5381611.html,,2014-05-23,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif. speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, April 1, 2014, following her lunch with President Barack Obama. Pelosi was asked several questions about the Affordable Care Act. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ca5b1f000040022570d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The fate of the Democrats in November's midterm elections will depend heavily on voter turnout -- particularly among unmarried women, who are historically less likely to vote in non-presidential election years. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is aiming to reverse that trend by embarking on a national bus tour to talk to single women about economic proposals that directly affect them. The bus tour will kick off June 1 in Seneca Falls, New York -- the site of the nation's first women's rights convention in 1848 -- and end four days later in Chicago. Pelosi and other Democratic members of Congress will travel to seven cities to meet local women and talk to them about their comprehensive women's economic agenda, ""When Women Succeed, America Succeeds."" The agenda includes legislative proposals like guaranteed paid family and sick leave, equal pay legislation, a higher minimum wage, more broadly affordable child care and stronger workplace protections for pregnant women. ""Single moms are busy holding down at least one job or more, raising their families and keeping the ship afloat, so they don't have time to be thinking about politics and what's going on in Washington, D.C., especially when they don't see an agenda that affects them directly,"" Pelosi told The Huffington Post. ""We hope we can give them hope by elevating this discussion and letting them know that somebody is fighting the fight for them."" Unmarried women overwhelmingly favored President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, contributing to the historic gender gap that propelled him to victory. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee estimates that participation among unmarried women will drop off significantly in the upcoming midterm, from 58 percent turnout in 2012 to 39 percent in 2014. One way to motivate women voters to turn out, the DCCC has concluded, is to talk to them about the economy. Women are the primary or co-breadwinners in two-thirds of American families, but they are far less financially secure than men. Women make up a disproportionate majority of minimum wage workers, and they earn up to 20 percent less than men on average. ""I think this is a situation where good policy is meeting good politics,"" said Kelly Ward, executive director of the DCCC. ""Advocating for women and families and the middle class has always been at the core of the party's values, but we have a real opportunity to talk to women about this now, at a time when economic issues are on the minds of voters and women are feeling the squeeze."" Most Republicans in Congress oppose the Democrats' women's economic proposals, saying they believe more government interference would only hurt the economy without boosting women's pay. Republicans blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act earlier this year, a bill that aimed to make it easier for women to sue employers over pay discrimination, because they said it would only serve to line the pockets of trial lawyers.Pelosi said she hopes the bus tour will motivate women to turn out this year -- not only to elect more Democrats, but to pressure Republicans to rethink their positions on some of these economic policies.""The fact is, women have a lot to lose by not voting in this midterm election,"" she said. ""The very idea that they would come out to the polls in big numbers can affect Republican thinking on these issues, and that would be a good thing."" "

Unfortunately, this promise is about as real as the ""meat"" in the classic McRib.Assurances from the company aside, U.S. Census Bureau data make clear that opportunities for advancement are more illusory than real at companies like McDonald's.The data show that front-line occupations like cashiers, cooks, and delivery workers -- earning a median hourly wage of $8.94 per hour -- make up roughly 90 percent of all jobs in the fast-food industry.Crew supervisors or shift managers, who earn a median hourly wage just slightly higher $13.06 per hour, make up another eight percent of jobs in the industry.Meanwhile, managerial and professional occupations like store managers or corporate employees -- the kind of positions the company points to as opportunities for front-line workers -- make up just two percent of all jobs in the industry.Maybe it's possible to justify paying lower wages to those starting out as fry cooks or cashiers if hard work and professional commitment could actually land you a position as a store manager or a spot at corporate headquarters one day. But this story of upward mobility is just that, a story, completely divorced from the facts.Remarkably, McDonald's also defends its business model by holding up an even more far-flung option for advancement: franchise ownership. At this week's shareholder meeting, the company highlighted the story of Ricardo Carceres, who started as a crewmember and says he is now preparing to buy his own franchise. But these individual success stories notwithstanding, the data make clear that opportunities for franchise ownership in the fast-food industry are even more limited than the chances for promotion to management.Census data show that franchise owners make up just one percent of all positions in the fast-food industry; at McDonald's, franchise owners are an even more select crowd, making up just 0.3 percent of all jobs at the company.The sky-high financial requirements the company uses to screen potential franchise applicants helps explain why this opportunity remains an unrealistic option for front-line workers: company records show that McDonald's franchisees must have at least $750,000 in non-borrowed assets in order to be approved -- an impossible qualification for a cashier while remaining stuck in a job paying $8.94 per hour.McDonald's may think that selling this ""mobility myth"" will help deflect mounting criticism for the time being, but the reality is clear. And compared to these miniscule chances for promotion, it should be no small surprise that thousands of McDonald's workers now see striking for $15 per hour and a union as the only real path for securing a living wage in their lifetimes.Jack Temple is a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project."

Such a ""hummus law"" would prevent Sabra's competitors from marketing dips made from ingredients other than chickpeas -- or chickpea dips that do not include tahini, a Middle Eastern sesame paste -- as ""hummus."" Sabra Marketing Director Greg Greene argued that an FDA definition, like those the administration already has in place for products such as ketchup, mayonnaise and peanut butter, could clear up consumer confusion now, and especially down the line. ""It's a slippery slope,"" he said. ""If there's no definition for the term 'hummus,' products could stray further and further from what hummus traditionally is and what the standard is worldwide. That could make consumers unsure of what they're getting when they pick up a container of something called 'hummus.'""The definition of hummus is a surprisingly high-stakes issue. The hummus product category has exploded in value over the past decade, with U.S. sales topping $600 million in 2013. Greene said that although Sabra, a joint venture of PepsiCo and Israel-based The Strauss Co., currently controls about 65 percent of the American market, more and more other companies have been trying to market dips made with ingredients such as lentils, edamame, eggplant and black beans as hummus in the last year or two. ""If hummus has no specific identity to refer to in the law, you could in essence call our guacamole 'avocado hummus,'"" he said. As it happens, the FDA doesn't specifically define ""guacamole"" either -- meaning no government official would stop Sabra from changing the name of the dip it currently calls ""hummus"" to ""chickpea guacamole."" That certainly sounds absurd. But if Sabra had its way, it would also be illegal. Why? The company's 11-page petition cites culinary history, foreign countries' food standards and nutritional data in support of the idea. But there's no specific reason that the country that invented the Cronut and the Doritos Locos Taco should be conservative with its culinary nomenclature because of history or tradition. And indeed, careful analysis of the filing shows that the crux of Sabra's argument rests, as much as anything else, on etymology. ""In Arabic and Hebrew alike, 'hummus' commonly denotes both the chickpea itself and the dip that is made from it,"" the filing reads. In other words, because ""hummus"" is Arabic and Hebrew for ""chickpea,"" the dip's name implies its ingredients, as the (regulated) name ""tomato juice"" does but the (unregulated) name ""salsa,"" Spanish for ""sauce,"" does not. The filing even makes this explicit when it states, ""By definition, 'hummus' made from legumes or vegetables other than chickpeas is not hummus.""But Sabra wouldn't be willing to make such a grand philosophico-linguistic claim without citing some other authority. And in this case, they cite one near and dear to our hearts: us. The Huffington Post!The footnote for that crucial sentence directs readers to a June 2013 feature on Sabra by HuffPost reporter Saki Knafo. It's a great feature, well worth reading in full if you missed it the first time. You'll find the key passage, in this context, about two-thirds of the way through the piece. Knafo recounts a culinarily rich trip to Israel with his father who, it turns out, is a bit of a hummus snob. Knafo's father, he writes --insists that hummus should have a subtle, earthy flavor, and disdains spicy hummus, lemony hummus, hummus with chipotles, hummus with artichoke, hummus with basil, sun-dried tomato or spinach, and most of all, the dip referred to as ""black bean hummus.""In short, if the FDA ends up accepting Sabra's petition, and enforcing a definition of hummus as strictly made of chickpeas, the law will change, in part, because of the stubborn assertions of one Huffington Post reporter's father.

3,POLITICS,Republicans Gear Up For The Great Grouse War Of 2014,Andrew Perez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-endangered-grouse_n_5381651.html,,2014-05-23,"In this photo provided by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department a male lesser prairie chicken seeks a mate in Yoakum County southwest of Lubbock, Wednesday, April 9th, 2014. (AP Photo/Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Earl Nottingham)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ca5d210000d601c96101.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans are working to block federal protection of several species of grouse, arguing that listing the birds as endangered will hurt energy development and agriculture in Western states. Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and four other House Republicans, along with Sens. Mike Enzi and John Barrasso of Wyoming, on Thursday introduced the Sage Grouse Protection and Conservation Act, which would prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from listing the greater sage grouse and Gunnison sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act for 10 years. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the Gunnison sage grouse as endangered in January 2013, but hasn't finalized the decision. The agency is also considering whether to add the greater sage grouse, which lives in 11 Western states, to the endangered species list. A decision on that is expected next year.The Republicans sponsoring the legislation said they're concerned that new grouse protections may impede economic development. ""The last thing states need are more one-size-fits-all regulations from Washington that won’t help species and will devastate local economies,” Barrasso said in a press release. “By forcing Washington to stay out of the way, this bill puts Americans who live in these communities and know what works best in charge of managing the land and wildlife. It also gives states the tools they need to develop a sound conservation plan and ultimately prevent the sage grouse from being listed -- a win-win for wildlife and our economy.”Environmental groups said federal protections for the birds are imperative for their survival. The population of the greater sage grouse has ""declined roughly 90 percent from its historic numbers,"" less than a century ago, said Mark Salvo, the director of federal lands conservation at Defenders of Wildlife. The birds ""are experiencing death by a thousand cuts,"" Salvo said, because they are ""highly sensitive to landscape disturbances, human activities like oil and gas drilling or livestock grazing, construction of energy facilities and mining."" Salvo said he hoped a federal and state conservation plan already underway will help to preserve sage grouse and their habitats. But legislation ""prioritizing the state strategies over other federal alternatives"" could make things worse, he said. He said the Gunnison sage grouse's total population is fewer than 5,000, making it ""arguably the most imperiled of all the grouse species that are under consideration for protection under the Endangered Species Act."" Meanwhile, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) is leading an effort to block Fish and Wildlife's decision to list another type of grouse, the lesser prairie chicken, as ""threatened."" Fish and Wildlife in May listed the lesser prairie chicken as threatened, after its population fell by nearly half in one year to roughly 17,000. The bird's range covers primarily private land in the southern Great Plains. Huelskamp told HuffPost this week that he has submitted an amendment to the Interior and Environment appropriations bill that would bar the agency from using any funds in support of the listing. He said he may offer another amendment to “defund Fish and Wildlife Service,” though he didn't make clear whether that would be a whole or partial cut. He said he is also working on separate legislation that would delay enforcement of the lesser prairie chicken listing for at least a year, which he said would provide time to demonstrate the effectiveness of a voluntary, five-state conservation plan.Farmers, ranchers, oil and gas developers and rural electrical cooperatives all fear the lesser prairie chicken's listing will hurt their business, said Huelskamp. Renewable energy development also may be affected, he said. ""It was the number one issue on the mind of folks in western Kansas for many months now. We're already hearing real-life examples of economic activity not taking place,"" he said. Ya-Wei Li, director of endangered species conservation at Defenders of Wildlife, said the concern about enforcement is overblown. ""Oftentimes, we hear this fear that Fish and Wildlife is going to drive around and start issuing citations to ranchers for violating the Endangered Species Act, and the reality is that just doesn't happen,"" he said. Defenders of Wildlife and WildEarth Guardians have argued the lesser prairie chicken's listing as “threatened” is far too lenient, and that bird should be considered “endangered.” An endangered listing comes with more stringent rules governing the protection of the animals and their habitat.""Its decline has been catastrophic, its populations are on the verge of extinction,” said Erik Molvar, a wildlife biologist with WildEarth Guardians based in Laramie, Wyoming. “Endangered species status is what is legally required when a species gets this scarce.”Huelskamp said he believes the lesser prairie chicken population is struggling primarily due to drought, not development. ""As long as it doesn't rain, we're not going to have any more birds,"" he told HuffPost. Molvar and Li acknowledged that drought has had some impact, but they said droughts occur frequently in the high plains. ""Drought or no drought, the extinction risk is very high for the lesser prairie chicken right now,"" said Li. He said that the legislative efforts to block protections for the bird are “really part of a larger legislative effort to gut the Endangered Species Act."" There have also been state efforts to block federal protections for the grouses. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback (R) signed a bill two weeks ago that claims state sovereignty over non-migratory wildlife, including both the lesser and greater prairie chicken. That bill gives the state attorney general the power to block any federal protections for the birds.The state has also joined a federal lawsuit that Oklahoma filed against Fish and Wildlife seeking to block protection of the lesser prairie chicken.Huelskamp said there can be no peaceful coexistence between development and protections for the birds. ""There's no living together,"" said Huelskamp. ""If you're going to shut down an oil well, it's picking ... You're picking the lesser prairie chicken over oil wells. Or else, why would they be out issuing those regulations?"""

Kay Hagan (N.C.), Mark Begich (Alaska), Mark Pryor (Ark.) and Mary Landrieu (La.), as well as Kentucky candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes. Those hailing from more traditionally Democratic states fully embrace the need to confront the issue. They include Sens. Al Franken (Minn.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.). But in swing states some candidates also discuss the issue on their websites, such as Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, whose website touts the senator’s efforts to “confront the global threat of climate change.”Other Democrats don’t address the issue quite as directly. Rep. Gary Peters, who is running for Michigan's open Senate seat, touts that he has “fought for clean air and clean water in Michigan communities” without mentioning “climate change.” Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic candidate for Iowa's open Senate seat, also does not refer directly to climate change on his campaign website, but he discusses his support for the Renewable Fuel Standard as a way to make “clean energy progress.”And then there is Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate candidate running in Republican-leaning Georgia. She goes squarely at the matter on her website: “We must continue to decrease our reliance on foreign oil and confront the challenges of climate change.” Nunn's website continues:See our assessment of Republican candidates' websites here."

Who will the pope meet? Where will he pray? In a region that lies at the nexus of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths, what can we expect from the leader of the world's largest church?  Barghouti, 40, isn't Christian, doesn't live in any of the cities on the pope's itinerary and has no plans to be among the crowds expected to wait hours to see the pontiff during his upcoming Middle Eastern visit.Yet as a Muslim living in the West Bank, Barghouti is paying close attention to what the world's most prominent Christian leader will have to say about the cause for Palestinian statehood, and what he'll say about Islam, the region's largest religion.""How does he respect our faith? How does he engage it?"" asked Barghouti, a foreign news editor at the newspaper Alhayat Aljadeeda. ""His words will be heard all over the world.""When the pope begins his three-day pilgrimage to Amman, Bethlehem and Jerusalem this Saturday, he'll have a full schedule of events, each imbued with spiritual and political significance. In Jordan, he'll meet the king and queen, as well as Iraqi and Syrian refugees, and visit the river where Christians believe Jesus was baptized. The Palestinian Authority will confer with Francis in Bethlehem before he celebrates Mass in Manger Square. In Jerusalem, Francis will pray with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople -- a leader for more than 250 million Orthodox Christians -- and sign a joint declaration of Catholic-Orthodox unity. He'll also go to Jerusalem's Western Wall and greet the city's grand mufti by the Al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites. Afterwards, the pope will separately meet the city's chief rabbis, followed by a discussion with the Israeli president.Vatican experts say the pope's prayers at holy Christian sites, as well as his overtures to Orthodox Christians and Jews, are not unexpected for his first pontifical visit to the Holy Land. But the question remains of how -- and to what extent -- he'll engage Islam and the region's Muslims. ""The church's relationship to Muslims took a blow under Pope Benedict XVI,"" said John Esposito, director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University. ""It's time to see what Francis can pull off.""Esposito, who is traveling to Amman to be in the pope's Saturday audience, pointed to Pope Benedict's infamous 2006 speech in which he quoted Emperor Manual II Paleologos, a 14th-century Christian ruler who characterized the Prophet Muhammad's work as ""evil and inhuman."" Widespread protests against the Vatican ensued in Islamic countries. Even after Benedict apologized, prayed at an Istanbul mosque and convened a summit with Muslim leaders, tensions continued to simmer. In 2008, when Benedict prominently baptized a Muslim journalist, Muslims involved in a high-profile papal dialogue expressed dismay at what some saw as a deliberate insult.""Some people are still injured from Benedict's remarks today. Francis has taken a more popular approach so far,"" Esposito said. ""He's tried reaching out first, instead of doing it as damage control.""One of Francis' first newsmaking moves, a little more than a month after his election, was to include women and Muslims when he performed a pre-Easter ritual Maundy Thursday foot-washing at a Roman juvenile detention center last year. The unusual move left Catholic traditionalists befuddled. In the same ceremony this year, the pope washed the foot of a disabled 75-year-old Muslim man. And last summer, the pope released a personal Ramadan greeting to the world's Muslims, calling it an ""an expression of esteem and friendship for all Muslims.""""It was a significant move for a message that is typically carried out by the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. Pope John Paul II did something similar in 1991,"" said Scott Alexander, director of the Catholic-Muslim studies program at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Alexander suggested that Francis is ""following in the footsteps"" of John Paul II, who became the first pope to visit a mosque during a May 2001 trip to Damascus. Earlier, in a 1999 audience with Muslim leaders and the patriarch of Babylon, John Paul II famously kissed a Quran. The picture made the front pages of newspapers in Islamic countries. ""In the Catholic tradition, dialogue is not just talking, but engaging in deep and mutually enriching friendships with people of other faiths,"" said Alexander. ""This is the hope of what could possibly come between Pope Francis and Muslims he meets.""In September, Francis sent a letter to the grand imam of Al-Azhar, a prominent Islamic university in Cairo, calling for a ""mutual understanding between the world's Christians and Muslims in order to build peace and justice."" An official dialogue between the Vatican and the top Islamic seminary had been cut short in 2011 after Al-Azhar officials complained of Benedict's ""repeated negative references to Islam."" (Francis, then a Buenos Aires cardinal, had harshly criticized Benedict's statement).""This is a very important moment for [Pope Francis],"" said the Rev. Manuel Dorantes, a Chicago-based Vatican spokesman. ""To be part of ecumenism and interreligious relations in a world that has shown so much fragmentation of Christianity and hostility due to religious extremism on all sides -- Christians, Jews and Muslims -- he is emphasizing a need for a conversation.""That doesn't mean the pope's tour will be without difficulties. In a region with deep tensions, from discrimination against Christians and religious minorities to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Syrian civil war, experts say Francis could easily get caught in the crossfire of competing parties. His plans to meet with top representatives from most major religious and political groups, many of which have sordid histories with each other, creates a daunting balancing act. Both John Paul II and Benedict XVI held an interfaith gathering of chief rabbis and Jerusalem's grand mufti while they were in the Holy Land, but Francis will not hold such a meeting.""People will be looking very closely at what [Francis] says and does, and the words and actions will be chosen carefully,"" said Esposito. Past occasions have highlighted the importance of such an approach. When Benedict visited the Holy Land in 2009, for example, some Jewish leaders were offended that he said there were ""millions"" of deaths in the Holocaust instead of giving a more precise number. Benedict also called the Holocaust a ""tragedy,"" while many Jews preferred a stronger word: crime.In a first for a papal pilgrimage to the region, Francis' delegation will include an Argentine rabbi and an Islamic scholar. The rabbi, Abraham Skorka, will join the pope in the Palestinian territories and for his meeting with Jerusalem's grand mufti. Omar Abboud, who directs the Institute for Religious Dialogue in Buenos Aires, will accompany Francis at the Western Wall and the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.""Imagine what could be the power if you saw the pope and a rabbi go into a place where Jews traditionally cannot or do not go, or a Muslim doing the same,"" said Dorantes.He said the pope's first apostolic exhortation, released in November, may give clues to his approach during the pilgrimage, especially the importance the pontiff is placing on Christian-Muslim relations in a time of increasing religious strife and a growing exodus of Christians from the Middle East.""Our relationship with the followers of Islam has taken on great importance, since they are now significantly present in many traditionally Christian countries, where they can freely worship and become fully a part of society,"" Francis wrote in the exhortation, titled ""Joy of the Gospel."" The pope went on to remind Christians of similarities between the two faiths, including Muslims' belief in Jesus and his virgin birth to Mary.""An attitude of openness in truth and in love must characterize the dialogue with the followers of non-Christian religions, in spite of various obstacles and difficulties, especially forms of fundamentalism on both sides,"" the pope wrote."

As for women behind the scenes? Not so much. In fact, only one female will be among the writers and directors of Broadway's top shows this season. That would be Leigh Silverman, 39, who helmed Violet. The unique musical stars Sutton Foster as a woman whose face had been terribly scarred as a child, and who embarks on a journey across the South to seek healing by a televangelist. ""The first thing people said to me when I was nominated,"" says Silverman, ""was congratulations. The second was, 'why are you the only one?'"" Good question. Let's be charitable and say this may just be a fluky year: After all, last year's two winners -- for best direction of a musical and of a dramatic play -- were both women. But even the lone nominee herself is simultaneously glowing and alerting the theatre community to wake up. ""I don't think we're anywhere close to parity and producers have to consciously think about including more women -- and all minorities -- until it becomes part of their natural planning."" Silverman, a graduate of Carnegie Mellon, was nominated once before, in 2006, for Well, another show with a female protagonist. ""At that time, I was only the seventh woman ever to direct a Broadway play,"" she says. Despite others since, such as Susan Stroman and Pam McKinnon, a glass curtain still remains. It is usually only through a network of those who know and admire their work -- which has traditionally been honed ""downtown and off Broadway"" as Silverman says -- that the lucky few get to take charge. Not unlike in the film business (where Kathryn Bigelow remains the exception) the reception may be more favorable when the material is considered softer, ""character-driven.""   Violet surely fits the bill. This piece had been performed off Broadway 17 years ago, got some notice, won some awards, but disappeared from the dramasphere. Fast (well, not so fast) forward to 2013, when the Encore series -- which reprises underappreciated shows -- performed Violet in a one night concert version. Silverman was brought in to direct, the show was cut to one act, pared down in terms of stagecraft, and was such a success that a Broadway run was deemed possible. ""We like to call it a 'reviviscul,'"" laughs Silverman of the re-imagined show. ""Frankly, I think the world has caught up with it, including being willing to watch something with a woman at its center. Though our audiences are male and female because at heart it is really a father-daughter story. It's a vulnerable piece of theatre."" The fact that it is also about a woman dealing with external versus internal beauty has also taken on more resonance in these youth and beauty-obsessed times. As Silverman sees it, ""we are all scarred in some ways."" One key decision she made was not to show the much-discussed damage on the main character's face. ""We thought about that,"" she says, ""but decided that the story exists as a metaphor and we wanted that aspect to work in the audience's imagination.""  Female playwrights still have the much tougher time making Broadway the Great ""Write"" Way. There the statistics are frankly horrible and the sexism seems systemic, even unconscious. It's simply who is familiar with whom, and the club has been far more male dominated. Ironically, investors and producers seem more comfortable allowing foreign female writers, such as Yasmina Reza, to take center stage. The good news is that a few more female directors are being trusted with calling the shots, even with well-known and possibly new-to-stage actors like James Franco and Zach Braff. If Leigh Silverman takes home the Tony in a few weeks, maybe things will loosen up a bit. Though it didn't work last year, did it? In the meantime, she is not letting this solitary spotlight go to her head: ""The day the Tony nominations came out,"" she says, ""I started working on my next show, which is in a 99-seat theatre way off-Broadway. But don't get me wrong, it is every director's dream to be on Broadway. It is still the forum that signifies who really matters in this arena. I am honored to be nominated but I truly would rather not be the only representative of my gender."""

From the outside, it is hard to see much hope in the pictures coming out of Nigeria today but it is important to stay focused on who we should be listening to -- people not terrorists. Watch the video our partners Save the Children took for our MY World survey last year and see the real face of Nigeria -- schoolchildren just like any others: engaged and energetic. They talk to the camera with dignity and intelligence, telling us what it is they want for a better life -- education, better access to jobs and a good government. One girl says she wants to see the end of drug trafficking. Another simply asks for ""whiteboards for our classroom.""How is it that in 2014 a girl still has to ask for a whiteboard in her classroom? How is it that in 2014 more than 200 girls can simply vanish into a forest for more than a month? Millennium Development Goal number 3 is to promote gender equality and empower women. We still have a long way to go in a world that allows these questions. Save the Children talked to more than 500 Nigerian children in several different states as part of our global survey that has, to date, spoken to more than 2 million people about their hopes and dreams for a better future. The aim is to make a more inclusive, better-informed 2015 Sustainable Development Agenda to take over from the Millennium Development Goals.The MDGs have had great successes but they were not set by the people. If enough people raise their voices, like these schoolchildren have, the new agenda will be. MY World spoke to more than 2,500 people in Borno state itself, the state the schoolgirls were taken from. Youth corps members volunteered to go out and interview those who could not vote by Internet or mobile phone. They found that the Borno peoples' top priorities for a better life were good health, an honest and responsive government and a good education. Improving security came fourth on the list of actions people thought needed to be carried out to address livelihood constraints. Security came after tackling corruption, ineffective government and job creation. Does any of this sound like something that might have helped these schoolgirls? Ask the people what needs to be changed first and these are the answers you get. Improve security, so our children can not be taken from us and our towns are not blown up with bombs, shake up government, so if it happens something is done about it, and create some jobs, so our young people have a focus and a dignity of life which prevents them for falling in with groups like Boko Haram.What has happened to these girls is a tragedy, something that will mark their and their families' lives forever. What will also be a tragedy is if we continue to ignore what ordinary people tell us they need. It is those who are living those lives who know where the problems lie."

Chagas disease is a leading cause of severe and life-threatening heart disease of the extreme poor in the Americas and gradually is becoming a disease that affects all social classes around the world. It is caused by a microscopic parasite known as a trypanosome that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by blood-feeding ""kissing bugs"" at night. Trypanosomes have the ability to invade human hearts and cause severe cardiac damage. The disease affects mainly people who live in poverty, mostly because their poor-quality houses allow the ""kissing bug"" vector to thrive in the cracks and crevices of mud, brick and thatch. Throughout South and Central America it strikes those who live in squalor often not far from nearby areas of great wealth.  World Cup-participating nations such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay have made great strides in eliminating new transmission of Chagas disease through national programs of insecticidal spraying, but it remains a sad fact that most people living with Chagas disease are never tested for their illness, and less than 1 percent of these infected individuals have access to treatment. Instead they are mostly neglected by their medical communities, and allowed to become sick and die. More than 10,000 such people die every year of Chagasic heart disease. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico lead the world in terms of number of cases -- more than one million each -- and deaths. Beyond its health impact, Chagas disease also causes an estimated $7 billion in global economic losses as infected people become too ill to work and the health care costs accumulate for managing heart disease. It comes as no surprise that a new study conducted in Mexico just determined that it is ultimately less expensive to treat a Chagas disease patient than not to treat.The two medicines that can be used to treat Chagas disease have unwanted side effects but have the potential to cure a patient if he or she is caught early enough in the course of their disease. The primary drug, benznidazole, is being manufactured locally in Brazil -- in Pernambuco in the northeast of Brazil -- as well as by a second producer in Argentina. The other drug, nifurtimox, is available for free through an agreement between the World Health Organization (WHO) and Bayer, a German pharmaceutical company.Our Global Chagas Disease Coalition of research and advocacy organizations works to encourage governments of the affected countries to identify and diagnose patients and put them on anti-parasitic therapy, supported by growing evidence of the efficacy of the current treatment for chronic patients, as well as accelerate research and development (R&D) for badly needed new health tools. A recent Coalition experts meeting found that most people living with Chagas disease are unaware of their illness until they develop advanced heart disease and by then it is too late for the medicines to be effective. Thus, much like other forms of heart illness or other chronic diseases such as cancer, early detection and treatment is the key to a successful therapeutic outcome.   Today, three-quarters of the world's Chagas disease patients live in the nine Latin American countries that will be represented in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Another 375,000 patients live in the United States where there is also evidence for Chagas disease transmission among the poor and in Spain, the most affected European country. In parallel with scaling up screening and treatment of Chagas disease, R&D needs to be boosted to improve currently available diagnostics and to develop better and safer treatments or vaccines, all for improved individual patient care and sustainable, long-term disease control. For decades, scientists in Brazil, Argentina, and elsewhere in Latin America have conducted important, pioneering research on Chagas disease in the areas of diagnostics and treatment, as well as basic research that are now yielding results that could be translated into new drugs, and vaccines.  Ultimately, solving the Chagas disease problem in the Americas will require new public policies and the active participation of an alliance that includes governments, academia, affected communities, patient advocacy groups, the medical community, and the pharmaceutical industry.  The theme of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil is ""all in one rhythm."" So far that rhythm could leave behind millions of Chagas disease sufferers in the Americas.

Today, Ali lives with his extended family in a cramped, one-story building in this remote suburb of Antakya, where he struggles to find enough money to feed his family, and often fails to make rent.""We have nothing,"" said Ali, who asked to be identified only by his first name, as he sat on a thin mattress in his home's simply appointed sitting area. In one corner of the room, three young children watched Turkish-language ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons on an antiquated 20-inch television. In another, Ali's aging mother, who suffers from diabetes and chronic pain, cried softly for her daily treatments.Turkey has earned praise for its management of the massive inflow of refugees from Syria, especially the quarter million or so who have managed to find rooms in one of the pristine government-run camps.But the vast majority of Syrians taking refuge in Turkey -- half a million or more, by United Nations estimates -- live outside these official structures, in major cities and rural slums, where, they say, they have received little or no assistance from the government, and have reached the limit of their welcome.By law, they cannot hold jobs with Turkish companies, and their children cannot attend Turkish schools. And as the conflict moves into its fourth summer, these refugees are finding that what little savings they may have initially relied on are rapidly drying up. ""I would have much preferred to stay in a camp,"" Ali said. ""We cannot afford to live like this for so long.""For medicine and other basic needs, including his children's education, Ali, like most of the other approximately 15,000 Syrians who make their home in Narlica, relies almost entirely on an independent aid organization called the Narlica Charity for Syrian Relief -- an impromptu collaboration of other Syrian refugees in the area who saw a lack of official or international services and decided to act.""We owe everything to the charity,"" Ali said. ""If it wasn't for them, many people in this community would be living on the streets.""The Turkish government ""doesn't do anything at all for these people,"" said Jamil Shahin, the director of the Narlica charity, during an interview in the group's makeshift office across town.Shahin, himself a refugee from Latakia province, is a large man with a sonorous voice and an unhurried, seen-it-all manner. He arrived in Narlica about two years ago, expecting to stay for a few weeks or months -- and has never made it home.""When I came here, no one helped me. No one was helping anyone,"" he said. ""So when I looked around and saw the tragic situation that was affecting the people here, we decided we had to get together and form an association, and divide up the responsibilities.""The charity, which formed nine months ago, began by collecting donations from the community, asking anyone who could to contribute 10 Turkish lira (about five dollars). Using donated goods and volunteered time, the organizers turned an abandoned ground-floor office into a community center and free health clinic, which now treats 170 patients a day.They put together a website (now largely untended) and a better-maintained Facebook page, and have received donations of medicines from religious charities as far away as Libya.But Narlica is off the beaten path for government aid groups and major international organizations, and summoning consistent resources has proven frustratingly difficult.Majd al-Shoufi, the director of another independent Syrian NGO called Insan, recently did a project in Narlica to help young children cope with the traumas of living through a war.But al-Shoufi, who lives just a few kilometers away in Antakya, said that merely finding the place depended on sheer fluke.""If I hadn't been brought to the camp here by a friend, I never would have even heard of it,"" he said.The program was a wild success: Al Jazeera English covered the group's efforts, and much of the community turned out for a final night's performance by the children. But a second grant to continue his work, from the Danish government, never materialized, al-Shoufi said, and he has been forced to put his group's activities on hold while he looks for a job so he can pay his own rent.Ali's children participated in the program, and when al-Shoufi visited the home recently, the children tugged at his shirt, asking him when the activities would start again.""I don't know,"" al-Shoufi said, shaking his head sorrowfully.Meanwhile, Ali's own burden has recently been compounded: A family of six, acquaintances from back in Hama, arrived at Ali's doorstep a few days earlier, saying they had fled the country and needed help. Now, Ali's tiny home hosts 14 people.""They said they had nowhere else to go,"" Ali said. ""So we have to help them."""
12,POLITICS,San Francisco Crack Pipe Exchange Program Plans Expansion,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crack-pipe-exchange-san-francisco_n_5367645.html,,2014-05-22,"A drug addict lights an improvised pipe in 'Crackolandia', a place where drug addicts gather to smoke crack, in downtown Sao Paulo Brazil on January 11, 2013.

Isaac Jackson, the San Francisco chapter president of the Urban Survivors Union, a drug users' rights group that has spearheaded the effort, said the program started as a “demonstration to show that all hell won’t break loose because we give out crack pipes.” But in the absence of a blessing from the city, they're preparing to move the program forward with money from an unnamed donor, an expanded team and support from other disease-prevention groups.“We’re hoping that if the city keeps ignoring this issue, we’ll get more organizations to get involved,” Jackson told The Huffington Post. He believes the donor can financially sustain the project for at least the rest of the year, and said he will look into hiring college interns and providing a stipend to someone who can take on a leading role.Since March, a team of about five Urban Survivors Union volunteers has been distributing 50 clean crack pipes, valued at 40 cents each, every week in the Tenderloin, south of the Market and Polk Gulch neighborhoods. Users do not need to trade in an old pipe but may only obtain one at a time. The goal, Jackson said, is simply harm prevention. According to the San Francisco HIV Prevention Planning Council, crack is an “HIV driver” that puts those in contact with it twice as likely to contract the virus. HPPC stated in its 2014 community assessment report that crack and cocaine are the biggest drug use issue for over 20 percent of people who seek publicly funded substance treatment in the city. Jackson said the health of these drug users, who contract and transmit HIV and Hepatitis C when they burn and cut their lips on broken and makeshift pipes, is a public health duty the city should take on.“We can run it for awhile, but we feel the city of San Francisco could do a much better job with its resources than we ever could,” he said, explaining that the Urban Survivors Union is not intended to be a service organization.“When it comes to crack smokers, there is a deficit of services and a deficit of care.” The crack pipe exchange program is following a similar path to San Francisco's flagship needle exchange programs, which provide clean syringes and needle disposal for intravenous drug users. The needle exchange program has been supported by the city since 1992 and distributes more than 2 million clean needles a year at nearly a dozen locations through the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and the Institute of Medicine have all found the needle exchange method to be effective at fighting HIV, but it was met with stiff opposition when the group Prevention Point first started distributing clean needles in 1988. In light of the AIDS epidemic, the city began funding the project three years later, and spent $1.2 million on the program in 2011, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.“Now, it’s very well accepted that syringe access is incredibly effective and cost effective at reducing new HIV transmissions,” Laura Thomas of the HPPC told CBS San Francisco. “Unfortunately, the cost of that learning curve is often peoples’ lives and we don’t have time to waste on this, so we need to start implementing [crack pipe exchange] now.”On top of lives saved, studies have found that implementing needle exchanges also saves significant spending in health care costs. According to research presented at the 2012 International AIDS Conference, if the U.S. covered 5 percent of needle exchange programs, it would save $66 million in annual treatment costs. Jackson said he launched his program after attending a San Francisco Department of Public Health presentation where a crack pipe exchange was discussed as a possibility. Thinking it would take months before the city would move on it, he decided to start his own distribution in March.“We figured the city would jump in and welcome us,” he said, “but we were surprised.” Once the public caught wind of Jackson’s efforts, both Mayor Ed Lee’s office and the Barbara Garcia, the city’s Department of Public Health director -- neither of whom returned HuffPost’s requests for comment -- announced they would not even consider supporting a crack pipe exchange. “We aren’t doing it because there is no evidence that demonstrates that it’s effective,” Department of Public Health spokeswoman Rachael Kagan told Time magazine this week. “Our harm-reduction programs are evidence-based and part of a comprehensive program of care. ‘Let’s start handing out crack pipes’ is way too reductionist and too narrow for the department to take on.”Since 2010, Seattle has been home to the only other known crack pipe exchange program in the U.S., and a crack pipe vending machine opened in Vancouver, British Columbia, last year. Jackson worries city officials oppose his crack pipe exchange not because of health concerns, but because of fear over how it may taint the city’s image. He pointed to an email obtained and published by the Bay Area Reporter, in which the mayor’s director of communications, Christine Falvey, asked Garcia to clarify the city’s opposition, writing that they “don’t want any Fox News SF headlines on this.”That attitude is frustrating to Jackson, who feels crack carries a stigma as a “drug of the ghetto,” which has led to users’ health being largely disregarded. Studies have found 23.9 percent of crack users and dealers in Harlem, a neighborhood of New York City, are HIV positive. Yet the crack pipe exchange, advocates say, encourages a healthier lifestyle even beyond mitigating transmission through broken pipes. “This gets people to be conscious about their drug use,” Jackson said. “It doesn’t mean they have to stop using, but they can just be more aware of what’s going on.”Thomas of the HPCC agreed, telling CBS that an official program could operate more as an outreach service.“It may seem counterintuitive, but it’s a great program,” she said. “Once you can bring people into your program, make them feel respected, taken care of, then they’re more likely to come back and get on HIV meds and want to be engaged and taking care of their health.”While San Francisco police could cite Urban Survivors Union volunteers for possessing drug paraphernalia, an officer told Vice earlier this month that the charges are so minor and the chance of prosecution so low that they “wouldn’t touch that with a 10 foot pole.”Jackson said he plans to keep pressuring the city and is organizing with some of his allies. But for now, he’s celebrating having started the conversation.“It’s been an overall success in the sense that we’ve raised the issue,” he said. “People have been ignoring this, and we’ve raised the issue from obscurity to media.”"

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). According to a report by The Oregonian, Republicans who cast ballots in the Senate primary Tuesday after news about the stalking incident came out were less likely to back Wehby. Oregon is a vote-by-mail state, meaning that every voter gets a ballot that they then need to turn in before 8 p.m. on Election Day. As many as half of Republican voters cast their ballots after the stalking revelations came out Friday morning, according to the Oregon Secretary of State's office. More details from The Oregonian: Elections workers count ballots by starting with those cast first and working forward, so it's possible to get a sense of how voter behavior changed in the last days of the voting period. Unlike in almost all states, Oregon voters receive a mailed ballot and have just over two weeks to return them.In recent weeks, Wehby's relationship with lumber baron Andrew Miller has garnered national headlines. The state Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that a super PAC funded by Miller -- who was once romantically involved with the candidate -- is illegally coordinating with Wehby's campaign. On Friday morning, Politico reported that last year, Miller filed a police report accusing Wehby of stalking him. Miller has since said he regretted calling the police on Wehby. On Monday, the day before the primary election, The Oregonian reported that Wehby's ex-husband ""accused her of 'ongoing harassment' as they were going through a divorce in December 2007 and also called the police on her in December 2009 over a dispute about seeing their children."" Ultimately, however, the revelations came out too late to deny Wehby a victory against state Sen. Jason Conger (R), who was at a significant financial disadvantage during the campaign. On Wednesday, Wehby went after Democrats for airing the old police reports in an interview with conservative radio host Lars Larson.""For the Democrats to be willing to try to shred my family and drag my kids and my friends through this again, you know, just for their own political gain,"" she said.

As anyone who's sent or received one of these will attest, they are some of the most moving letters ever written, but sadly, many of them are being tossed or otherwise lost. Fortunately, one man has made it a mission to do something about that.author Andrew Carroll shows special letters from the collectionAndrew Carroll, best-selling author of War Letters (and most recently, Here Is Where), has spent years gathering, sharing, and writing about letters from every conflict the U.S. has participated in. Watch this video to see some of the most intriguing and powerful ones.Recently, Carroll donated the entire collection of more than 100,000 letters to Chapman University in Orange, California for safekeeping and to ensure access going forward, but he and the university welcome fresh contributions.

It's the ultimate offshore gated community, where the inhabitants possess magical machines that rid them of disease so that they can practically live forever. The shuttles, meanwhile, contain the poor, the sick, ""the wretched refuse of your teeming shore."" In this science-fiction scenario, the Earth has been become little more than a third-world outpost of hovels, prisons, and unregulated factories.Two of the shuttles containing illegal border-crossers are immediately shot down. One of them, however, manages to land on Elysium. A mother and her disabled child break into a sparkling clean house and locate the magic machine. The child lies on the flat surface, the machine hums, and her handicap disappears. It's a short-lived triumph as armed guards seize the intruders and repair the security breach.The future, as Hollywood imagines it, rarely looks good. We've either bombed ourselves back into barbarism (Mad Max, The Road), trashed the environment, (Soylent Green, Wall-E), or somehow eliminated our ability to procreate (The Children of Men). In Total Recall, the horrors of unregulated capitalism have been outsourced to Mars where an autocrat runs a mining operation designed by Hieronymus Bosch.If in the past we imagined a future of distant penal colonies for the criminal 1 percent, we now are projecting a penal earth for the outcast 99 percent. Elysium is almost a parody of this 99-to-1 dichotomy, for the space station is home to only a tiny handful of people while Earth looks like the crack-ravaged South Bronx of the 1980s. In this scenario, the wolves of Wall Street have siphoned up as much wealth as they can before departing, not for some exclusive Caribbean island -- rising waters have presumably eliminated those tax havens -- but for the insulated comforts of outer space.Hollywood projects our dreams and fears. In the past our cinematic apocalypses have reflected our obsessions with nuclear holocaust and environmental degradation. We're certainly still worried about those fates -- along with pandemics and zombies -- but gross inequality now competes for our attention. The Occupy movement no longer squats in our squares. The indignados have faded into the European woodwork. But the analysis and demands of the 99 percent have managed to trickle up.Consider the new book by Thomas Piketty, the French economist. In his analysis of tax records in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Piketty shows how capitalists have run away with capitalism and left the workers behind. In more formal terms, when the rate of return on capital outstrips the growth rate of the economy, inequality rises. Moreover, Piketty shows how public policy has had a profound impact on wealth and poverty in society. The trends associated with the rise of finance capitalism and the spread of globalization have certainly encouraged the consolidation of a class of super-rich and the erosion of wages for the middle and working classes. But certain governments -- France, Germany, Japan -- have used tax and welfare policies to redistribute the wealth without any appreciable impact on growth.Not that I've read Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Piketty's book has become virtually impossible to obtain. I recently walked into the country's largest independent bookstore -- Powell's in Portland -- and asked for the best-seller. The clerk explained that every copy had been eagerly snatched up, and I should come back in a couple of weeks.What explains Piketty's extraordinary success? His book is certainly not the first study of economic inequality. My colleagues at the Institute for Policy Studies have been hammering at this issue for more than a decade. Chuck Collins published 99 to 1: How Wealth Inequality is Wrecking the World and What We Can Do About It a couple of years ago. The most recent version of our CEO pay report, which has documented the outrageous compensation packages for our titans of finance and business, focuses on the growing divide in the restaurant industry between the richly compensated (Howard Schultz of Starbucks) and the barely hanging on (the toilers in the fields of fast food). ""CEO Howard Schultz pocketed $236 million in exercised stock options and other 'performance pay' over the 2012-2013 period,"" the report explains. ""That translates into an $82 million taxpayer subsidy for Starbucks -- enough to raise the pay for 30,507 baristas to $10.10 per hour for a year of full-time work.""And even before Piketty became a surprise best-seller, we were awash in statistical evidence. ""In the United States, according to the economist Emanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, the richest 10 percent increased their share of total pretax income from about 33 percent in the late 1970s to 50 percent by 2012,"" Paul Starr writes in The New York Review of Books. ""The top one percent alone now capture more than 20 percent of total income, double the share they received before the Reagan years.""Piketty, however, provides the kind of continental, academic imprimatur that mere number crunchers in the United States lack. His use of an extensive data set appeals to the empirically minded, his prescriptions satisfy the policy-minded, and his references to Austen and Balzac impress Paul Krugman. And he offers the long view, situating today's inequality in the much larger historical context of oscillations in income distribution. Finally, his book has put the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute on the defensive, as they dust off their usual arguments about the dangers of taxation.But perhaps the most important reason for Piketty's success here in the United States is a latent outrage at the deal that the Obama administration made down at the crossroads at midnight in the wake of the financial crisis. As we all know, the U.S. economy did not collapse in 2009, though it came close. Many people continue to suffer from the financial follies of the 2000s, their homes foreclosed on, their jobs gone, their pension funds looted. But the Obama administration can point to larger, statistical successes: much lower unemployment rates (6.3 percent today compared to 10 percent in October 2009) and some modest growth (close to 3 percent last year). More critically, for all the high rollers on Wall Street who supported Obama's campaign, the stock market has gone steadily upwards, with the Dow Jones now cresting above 16,000 (a 94 percent increase over the last five years).The deal with the Devil, however, was an ugly one. Only one person is going to jail as a result of the widespread malfeasance connected to the financial crisis -- Kareem Serageldin of Credit Suisse. His story reads like one of those cautionary Mafia narratives in which one of the mobsters takes the rap for the entire gang, keeps his mouth shut, does his time, and returns for his payout when his time is up.For despite a very brief period of self-imposed austerity at the depths of the crisis, the financial world has continued to enjoy extraordinary success. Just take a look at how our oligarchs -- oops, I'm sorry -- our ""wealth generators"" have benefitted. The top 25 hedge fund managers took in an average $134 million in 2002. By 2009, their earnings went up to a billion dollars (that's right: they each made a billion dollars a year!). The market ""correction"" didn't send them back to zero or to Sing Sing. Rather, by 2012, they were still making tons more than in 2002: $537 million. In fact, in 2010, these top 25 managers together made four times as much as the CEOs of the top 500 Standard and Poor companies -- combined. These numbers make space station Elysium look more and more plausible.As for the Obama administration's effort to regulate Wall Street, it has been frankly half-hearted. The business world tried to upend Dodd-Frank and largely failed, but implementation of the reforms remains sketchy. Even that notoriously risky financial instrument, the commercial mortgage-backed security, is staging a comeback.The 2016 presidential elections will address a range of issues, many of them entirely irrelevant. Foreign policy will inevitably surface as candidates debate the pros and cons of the Obama doctrine. But unless a major war has broken out by that point, Americans will focus as they usually do on their own wallets. As such, the wisest candidates will focus on gross inequality. Piketty's book, whether it's read or not, should be a wake-up call for politicians. If inequality sells in the stores, it will sell at the polls as well.At the end of Elysium -- spoiler alert! -- the 99 percent have given up their strategy of trying to break into the ranks of the super-wealthy on a case-by-case basis. It just wasn't working. Instead, thanks to the Christ-like sacrifice of the Matt Damon character, they transform the entire system so that the health-case benefits of the magic machines are available to all. It's a powerful promo for universal health care, even it doesn't address the tough questions of how the limited resources of a heavily slanted economy can be shared fairly among all. But where Hollywood films end is where U.S. politics must begin.Crossposted with Foreign Policy In Focus"

The faction's leader, David Yau Yau signed a final peace deal with the South Sudanese government on May 9, 2014 in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Mediators who brokered South Sudan's fragile ceasefire called on May 13 for the warring sides to abide by the deal, with bloodshed showing no sign of stopping despite promises made on paper. Fighting broke out soon after dawn on May 11, a day after the ceasefire was signed by President Salva Kiir and rebel chief Riek Machar, the second time in the five-month conflict that a truce has failed to stick. AFP PHOTO/SAMIR BOLAFP PHOTO/ SAMIR BOL (Photo credit should read SAMIR BOL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc136b0240000d30b519fff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ethnic violence has engulfed South Sudan in a vast humanitarian crisis, already affecting millions of people in the world's newest country. Continuing violence -- which began five months ago -- threatens to disrupt entirely the current planting season, ending in May. Millions are already at risk from severe to extreme food insecurity according to UN figures; and as the rainy season descends on the region, transporting food, medicine and clean water resources becomes hugely more difficult. A failed harvest next fall makes it likely that hundreds of thousands will starve. Children will suffer most.After the ravages of the long civil war (1983-2005), South Sudan will be at risk of food shortages for years to come, indeed until the agricultural sector becomes dominant in the economy. To this grim fact we must now add the consequences of the brutal violence that began last December and has become increasingly ethnically defined. This confluence of forces has made catastrophe inevitable; the question is not whether famine will strike, but where and how hard -- and how many thousands of lives will be lost.Violence emerged explosively in Juba, capital of South Sudan, on December 15, growing out of political rivalries and competing visions of South Sudan's future. President Salva Kiir, following the initial violence, incarcerated a number of political opponents; however, a key opponent, former Vice President Riek Machar, escaped capture, made it to the bush, and began a military effort to overthrow the democratically elected Government of South Sudan. Salva is a Dinka (the largest ethnic group in South Sudan) and Riek is a Nuer (the second largest group): What began as a political dispute over governance reform quickly took on a vicious ethnic character, with mutual ethnic slaughter. Even seasoned field workers are shocked by the nature of the violence.Despite an obvious escalation of military violence, there was little meaningful international diplomacy. A January cease-fire was short-lived, and matters have deteriorated ever since, despite increasingly dire warnings from the ground; humanitarians already face intolerable risks in many places. In addition to threats to civilians and humanitarians, regional conflict has become a growing threat. Uganda early on threw its military support behind the Juba government, and other bordering nations such as Kenya are deeply alarmed.So matters festered for months -- from collapse of the January cease-fire until late April. Finally, serious international attention came to focus on the crisis. There were trips to Juba by UN human rights chief Navi Pillay (May 1) and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon (May 6), threatening all parties with prosecution for crimes against humanity. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, also belatedly, became involved in the effort to secure a cease-fire and threatened U.S. sanctions against those responsible (May 3).Subsequently, a cease-fire was torturously negotiated in Addis Ababa (May 9), an outcome unlikely without high-level attention and clear threats. Even so, few predicted success for the cease-fire, largely because of the belated nature of diplomatic efforts and lack of effective monitoring forces prepared for deployment. What can we learn from this tragic moment? First, attention to a crisis of the sort we are witnessing must be timely and forceful, bringing to bear all necessary resources when the possibility of tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths first becomes apparent.Second, without a standing or ready force of ceasefire monitors, fragile moments of opportunity are likely to be lost. Again, the May 9 cease-fire had no real chance because the Monitoring and Verification Mechanism stipulated in the agreement was not ready for immediate or near-term deployment. When cease-fires are possible in conflict situations, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations should have a force that can be assembled and deployed within 48 hours. A larger peacekeeping or peacemaking force may be necessary subsequently; but the best way to halt fighting is holding parties accountable to cease-fire agreements already negotiated.Contributions to this standby force should come from many militarily capable nations, with firm and specific commitments to deploy at the command of the Secretary-General. Alternatively, if Russia or China objects to the formation of a standing or ready cease-fire force, then a multilateral coalition of militarily capable nations -- determined to halt atrocity crimes before they gather momentum -- should be assembled. This requires significant surveillance equipment and trained personnel: helicopters, small fixed-wing aircraft, and surveillance drones. Expensive -- but not nearly so costly as war or a full-blown peace-making mission. Of one thing we may be sure: If responsibility cannot be assigned for violations of a cease-fire, chances for its survival are slim.South Sudan is the grimmest object lesson in the costs of belatedness and the lack of cease-fire surveillance capabilities. There will be other such conflict situations, and we should be guided by the lessons of effective, concerted international pressure as well as the consequences of failure to apply such pressure in timely fashion.Eric Reeves is a professor at Smith College and author of Compromising with Evil: An archival History of Greater Sudan, 2007 - 2012"

""Schengen I must be suspended and replaced with a Schengen II.""He also pressed for changes to the bloc's structure, arguing that the idea of all euro zone countries being of equal weight was ""a myth"" and that the list of policies to be coordinated at EU-level should be reduced to key areas such as agriculture, energy, trade and competition law.""There is not one Europe but two ... In the euro zone, we must stop believing in the myth of equal rights between all members.""""I am arguing for the creation of a large Franco-German economic zone at the heart of the euro zone that will allow us to better defend our interests while eradicating our fiscal and social handicaps,"" he wrote.Channeling frustration with Europe's executive arm, Sarkozy said the European Commission should no longer have legislative powers, and that these should become the exclusive domain of the European parliament. UNITING THE RIGHTPresident Francois Hollande's Socialist Party, still smarting from its rout in local elections in March, is seen coming in third place behind Sarkozy's former center-right UMP party and the National Front.Although he officially retired from politics after being beaten by Hollande in 2012, Sarkozy has fired off a number of salvos from the sidelines of politics, including a major speech setting out similar ideas on Europe in Berlin this February.""This (latest) intervention unites us because it brings together the Eurosceptics and those that want to keep on building up Europe,"" said Brice Hortefeux, a former minister in Sarkozy's 2007-2012 government and a long-time ally.""This is something on which we can build for the future,"" he told France Info radio.Jean-Francois Cope, the current leader of the UMP but who is struggling with low popularity levels, said it showed that Sarkozy was, unlike Hollande, able to give Europe the leadership it needed in economic and political crises.""Remember when Nicolas Sarkozy was president, as soon as there was a crisis in Georgia, he got immediately involved. Now look at this disaster, the complete absence of France in the Ukrainian crisis,"" he told RTL radio, referring to Sarkozy's shuttle diplomacy over the brief 2008 conflict in Georgia.

Jeanne Shaheen, and her Republican counterpart Kelly Ayotte.Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, is challenging Shaheen for her seat, and made calls to fellow Republicans about the bill before the vote. In those phone calls, he shared ""the same position he's stated publicly,"" his campaign spokeswoman Elizabeth Guyton told the Concord Monitor, confirming previous reports in The Huffington Post.Brown's public position has been that he opposed moving forward on the Shaheen bill because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would not allow an amendment to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Reid instead offered a standalone vote on the pipeline.Guyton said that Brown's outreach ""wasn't lobbying."" Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told the Washington Post that such hair-splitting obscures the reality that there are ""many communications that individuals have with lawmakers and staff that by any reasonable or logical standard are lobbying.""Ornstein went on. ""There is one compelling explanation: he wanted them to quash the bill to keep Jeanne Shaheen from having a legislative victory,"" he said. ""The fact that he repeated to them a public position face-to-face has little to do with it. He wanted them to kill the bill. By my standards, that is lobbying plain and simple.""Despite his campaign's denial of ""lobbying,"" Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC supporting Democratic Senate candidates, is sticking with the terminology. The group has launched a $224,000-plus ad buy attacking Brown over his efforts to prevent the bill's passage. The NH Journal reported Thursday that the ad will run on local TV station WMUR, New England Cable News and Comcast Sports NE.WATCH: “A rare moment in Congress,"" the ad's script reads. ""A bipartisan bill readies for passage in the Senate. Jeanne Shaheen’s energy efficiency bill to create jobs and save billions supported by businesses across New Hampshire.

Scott Brown just moved to New Hampshire and he’s already acting like his job is more important than yours.""HuffPost readers: If you're a New Hampshire resident and have seen the ad, please send a copy to openreporting@huffingtonpost.comImmediately after the bill failed, the New Hampshire GOP issued a statement saying that its demise was proof of Shaheen's ineffectiveness.

But after its defeat, Senator Shaheen doesn't have a single legislative accomplishment to run on as she seeks re-election. It's time to end Jeanne Shaheen's failed tenure in the Senate and replace her with a responsible Republican who can get results for New Hampshire,"" read the statement. Although the Shaheen-Portman bill had 14 initial cosponsors, including seven Republicans, just three GOP senators voted to end debate and move the bill forward. Ayotte  told Huffpost she voted to advance the bill despite a call from Brown. ""I just did what I thought was best based on my state and voted the way I thought I should,"" Ayotte said, adding that she ""wasn’t lobbied."" Guyton, however, confirmed to The Concord Monitor that Brown had expressed his concerns to Republican senators about moving forward on the bill absent a Keystone amendment. ""I told him what my position was. He didn’t push me on that or anything,"" Ayotte told HuffPost.The Senate Majority PAC ran an ad criticizing Brown's ties to Wall Street in January, before he had even announced his candidacy. Brown has been asked about the energy lobbying on the campaign trail, and offered an alibi at a recent campaign event. ""Apparently while I’m driving my truck through New Hampshire I, apparently, derailed a bill in Washington,"" he said in WMUR's Monday report. ""I have this amazing power, I guess.""A WMUR reporter followed up by asking if Brown ""actively advocated"" against the passage of Shaheen's bill. ""No, I didn't,"" he said. ""And I find it actually sad in Washington when there are failures they look outside themselves and try to blame other people for this.""The New Hampshire GOP, meanwhile, has blamed The Huffington Post for all this."
