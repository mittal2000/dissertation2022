After all, if you're not going on a family vacation to the beach, chances are that your getaway will include a visit to an amusement park. And why not? It's quality time with your clan, away from the ubiquitous TV and computer screens that increasingly monopolize our time at home together. Here are seven of America's best places to ride coasters, play carnival games and enjoy one another's company. craiglloyd / Flickr  [In Pictures: America's Best Theme Parks]  Luna Park Brooklyn, N.Y.Luna Park is a relative newcomer to a ""best of"" amusement park list like this one, but its Coney Island locale has experienced a brilliant past. Beginning in the mid-19th century, Coney Island lured New Yorkers to its shores for a sunny escape. Hotels and amusement parks popped up in quick succession, but just nearly a century later the last amusement park shut its gates. Luna Park, which opened in 2010, is hoping to rekindle Coney Island's romance with the amusement park. A number of rides -- designated as mild-, moderate-, high- and extreme-thrill -- reach their colorful beams into the sky. There are also a handful of carnival games like Duck Pond and Water Race that summon turn-of-the-century Coney Island, and several great options for noshing, from Luna Lemonade to hot dogs at Nathan's. But possibly the greatest thing about Luna Park is its close proximity to the Big Apple.  Walt Disney World Lake Buena Vista, Fla.There's a reason that generations of families have made the trek here. As cheesy as it sounds, there's something a little bit magical about Walt Disney World. After all, princesses are mingling with the crowds in the Magic Kingdom, a spaceship -- albeit a simulated one -- is blasting off frequently in Epcot and wild animals are roving through Animal Kingdom. And although Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. is the original Disney resort, Walt Disney World's diversity of amusements is hard to top. The park is certainly more expansive, with its 30,000 acres, four different theme parks, two water parks, multiple resorts and even a ""downtown."" And this summer will be a particularly exciting time to visit since Walt Disney World has unveiled its much-awaited Magic Kingdom expansion. The new Fantasyland includes the addition of a ""Little Mermaid"" ride Under the Sea, so to speak, as well as a recreation of Belle's quaint French village in ""Beauty and the Beast.""[See: Best Family Vacations in the USA]Dollywood Pigeon Forge, Tenn.­­­­Sure, Walt Disney World and Islands of Adventure make sense on a best list, but Dollywood? As in Dolly Parton? Yes ... let us explain. Nestled in the rolling countryside of the Smoky Mountains, Dollywood is a theme park with a side order of Southern hospitality. Plus, it's appeared nine times on Amusement Today's Golden Ticket 2012 awards as one of the best overall parks, one of the friendliest parks and one of the cleanest parks. You can enjoy a number of rides and attractions in the 150-acre theme park. You can also cool down at the 30-acre Dollywood's Splash Country water park, and you can even spend the night in an upscale Dollywood cabin. To get a full taste of Dollywood, book a four-course Southern meal and dinner theater at the nearby Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede.  Universal's Islands of Adventure Orlando, Fla.Universal's Islands of Adventure has Harry Potter. Enough said. Even though the last film debuted in 2011, Potter mania is still going strong. And the Islands of Adventure have cashed in on the craze with ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter."" Fans of the magical world can enjoy a butterbeer in The Three Broomsticks, buy a souvenir house scarf from Filch's Emporium and take the exciting Harry Potter and The Forbidden Journey ride through the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. If Potter passion never captivated you, Islands of Adventure could still be the park for you. It also houses attractions featuring Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Dr. Seuss and more. And this summer, a new attraction will debut -- TRANSFORMERS: The Ride-3D.Schlitterbahn New Braunfels Waterpark New Braunfels, TexasSplashing around a water park is a great way to beat the heat in the summertime ... And Schlitterbahn New Braunfels Waterpark is one of -- if not the -- best park of its kind. Plus, it's one of the more affordable parks on this list, with general admission tickets that are less than $60. Included in the cost of admission is access to a number of attractions, including an elevator water ride, two inner tube slides that are nearly 600 feet in length and even a heated pool and a swim-up bar for the adults. And this park has been so popular that a number of other locations have opened: So if you can't make it to New Braunfels, Texas, the parks in Galveston Island, Texas, South Padre Island, Texas, or Kansas City, Kan. are just as appealing.[See: World's Tallest Ferris Wheels]Cedar Point Sandusky, OhioPerched on a strip of land jutting out into Lake Erie, Cedar Point amusement park boasts picturesque surroundings. Even though its locale is off the beaten track, experts (like those at Amusement Today) regularly praise it as the best overall theme park in the country. But Cedar Point goes one step further: It refers to itself as the ""roller coaster capital of the world."" And with its 16 roller coasters -- one of which is opening this May and has already broken a world record (for its length and its 164-foot drop) -- maybe Cedar Point can legitimately say that. But in addition to the exhilarating rides for the young at heart, Cedar Point also offers attractions for the truly young: a bouncy house, bumper boats and more. In May 2013, Cedar Point will also debut its nearly five-acre Dinosaurs Alive! attraction. This interactive exhibit will comprise 4.5 acres filled with nearly 50 life-size dinosaur replicas, with prehistoric sounds echoing throughout Adventure Island.Knoebels Amusement Resort Elysburg, Pa.Knoebels Amusement Resort earns major props for its affordability. It bills itself as America's largest free-admission park, though before you get too excited -- it's not entirely free. Each ride and attraction costs a small fee, but no ride costs more than three bucks and some are as cheap as $.75. Categorized as Kiddie, Thrill and Family, Knoebel's attractions run the gamut -- from a merry-go-round to a wooden Phoenix Roller Coaster. Not much of a thrill-seeker? Knoebels also offers a Bald Eagle Habitat, an 18-hole golf course and museums. There's also a 900,000-gallon pool, which charges $6.50 for adults and $4.50 for children, with slides, diving boards and a large wading section for young children.[In Pictures: America's Best Theme Parks]  -- Emily H.

1,PARENTING,Ditching the Guilt As a First Step to Having it All,"Jeanne Garbarino, Contributor
Director of Science Outreach, The Rockefeller University; meta...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ditching-the-guilt_us_5b9d179ae4b03a1dcc845eff,"Let's ditch the guilt on the career front and the home front and live now without regret or apology for a job not only well done, but a life well-balanced.",2013-04-25,"This magazine cover image released by The Atlantic magazine shows cover from the July/August 2012 issue featuring an article by former State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter. The piece by Anne-Marie Slaughter describes her struggles balancing a high-powered career with raising her two sons. Since her magazine story last week burst open the debate on the difficulties for working mothers, she has heard from hundreds of all ilks, most of whom were grateful that such a high-flying career juggler has spoken up about the need for more flexibility on the job. (AP Photo/The Atlantic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d179a2100003100c560e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday, April 15th, two very profound things happened.The first event was and is nothing less than harrowing and wretched. That afternoon, two bombs were detonated at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. This senseless act robbed this earth of three lives, including an 8-year-old boy's, and resulted in countless injuries, many severe. Word of this tragedy spread rapidly, resulting in a global outpouring of compassion.The second event was much more isolated, affecting only a handful of people, including me. Just hours after the news from Boston started streaming in, I joined my colleagues at The Rockefeller University in a discussion about work-life balance led by Anne-Marie Slaughter. Slaughter, who was catapulted into the limelight after her famous (infamous?) Atlantic article ""Why Women Can't Have It All,"" presented compelling and honest points about gender equity in the workplace, and the current devaluing of the caretaker role versus that of the breadwinner. While it was a minor point in her presentation, Slaughter said something that burned into my brain: One of the most common things people say on their deathbeds is that they wished they'd spent more time with their family, that they had worked less.The juxtaposition of these two events in my personal space-time continuum has made me seriously reevaluate what the hell I am actually doing in my life. On one hand, I am a caregiver. I have two special and very energetic children who deserve to have a mother who can be fully present on a regular basis. On the other hand, I am a breadwinner. I have a demanding career that I've tirelessly invested in for over a decade. I've put substantial effort into building relationships with colleagues, and maintaining these relationships requires significant input.I love my kids. I love my job. But why is it that they seem to be competing for my attention? Why am I programmed to be overwhelmed with guilt when the balance shifts toward one or the other? Related: Why do others judge me when I have to make a choice?These questions stem from a deep-rooted societal philosophy that caretakers -- traditionally women -- should have only that role if they expect to fill it successfully. And breadwinners, well, they need to maintain a competitive, go-getter edge to win that bread. Written into the subtext of the breadwinning framework is the notion that kids will trip them up in the race. Regardless of whether you think this is a fair sentiment, the fact is that this mindset affects far more women than it does men.This problem has been recognized, with endless discussion and countless measures attempting to reform the workplace culture to reflect the ever-growing overlap between caregiver and breadwinner. But these measures are often too limited or are diluted by a tendency to revert to traditionally defined roles, either in the workplace or at home. That's why reform can no longer be an option. It's a necessity.In her discussion, Slaughter emphasized the need to reinvent the role of the breadwinner to reflect the notion that many breadwinners are also caregivers. This reinvention means completely changing the belief that to be successful as a breadwinner -- a term that itself implies competition -- you must be professionally present 100% of the time, both men and women. And I couldn't agree more.But, we can't just say that these philosophies have to change or take half-hearted swipes at reform. For those of us in the dual roles of caretaker and breadwinner (and the roles of friend, sister, niece, grandchild, neighbor, coworker and just being ourselves), we have to change. Yes, the infrastructure of our working culture needs a major overhaul. We need new policies that don't automatically select against people who choose to be working parents. And we need new language to describe these policies, like 'parental' leave instead of 'maternity' leave, because men can be and are caregivers, too.In addition to these institutional changes, we can do incremental things ourselves that could add up to something substantial. Things like not apologizing for leaving at 5 p.m. to pick up our children or for replacing our laptops and phones with a trip to the park or a snuggle on the couch, sans guilt trip. We can stop worrying that taking off for the night, or heaven forbid an occasional afternoon, will minimize our edge.But it isn't just about letting go of work guilt. We have to let go of guilt at home, too. Let go of the fact that the house might be a little messy or that the person who's caregiving while you're breadwinning might not do things exactly as you do. Maybe it's a small thing, but ditching guilt on both fronts is one example of how we can change ourselves so that we can, in turn, change our culture. And I can't emphasize enough that when I say ""we,"" I mean both men and women alike.I've always felt this way, but the recent string of senseless tragedies has exposed a personal sense of urgency. We are all at the mercy of randomness. No one expected the prestige and exhilaration normally associated with the Boston Marathon to be overshadowed by fear, confusion and overwhelming sadness. No one who attended this historic event ever expected a threat to their lives or that lives would actually be lost.I don't ever want to be that person on her deathbed who says she regrets not being with her family enough. But I, like any complete, multifaceted human, also don't want to die with regrets about my personal goals going unfulfilled or unpursued. No father or mother would want to experience either kind of self-reproach. Even more frightening -- so, so, so much more frightening -- I don't want to be that person who has to face saying goodbye to her own child and then find myself wishing I had been more present, that I had done more.For me, changing the culture of the workplace goes beyond being a woman who achieves a fancy title and a good paycheck. It means always remembering that my success is best measured by whom I get to share it with and how well-balanced my life is all around. I know that it is impossible to do everything right. But it is possible to live in a way that keeps you from feeling, on your deathbed, the weight of a lifetime of career- or family-related guilt. Let's ditch the guilt on the career front and the home front and live now without regret or apology for a job not only well done, but a life well-balanced.This article first appeared on Double X Science."

3,TRAVEL,Avoid The College Scene While Still Rejuvenating This Spring,"Tracy Christoph, Contributor

If you are looking for a spring break to help relax and release your mind from your daily stresses, you'll want to avoid the college scene. So many students travel at this time of year, and if you really want a relaxing time away, you'll want to avoid the typical ""Spring Break"" spots. Often, off-the-beaten-path locations or resorts at a slightly higher price point will offer a more mature crowd. Also, quaint destinations and smaller cities with fewer hotel choices may be a better option if you are looking for a calm and serene setting. Spring is not the time to visit hot spots, especially destinations like Cancun or Punta Cana, unless you prefer the party atmosphere. Remote destinations provide great storytelling opportunities upon your return home. I love telling people about places they haven't heard of before and sharing my unique experiences.Beyond researching your ideal destination, you'll want to seek out a great travel companion, too. I always look for someone who is energetic and willing to try something new at the drop of a hat. Others may prefer a traveler who is more low-key. As long as your energy levels match, you'll have a great time. Whether it's a friend, spouse or co-worker, a travel partner who is easygoing and goes with the flow will make your vacation experience that much better.Pack sunblock, a swimsuit, sunglasses and towel in your carry-on so you can make a quick escape to the beach when you arrive at your destination. And pack knowledge of your destination--especially if you are visiting a foreign country, as you'll want to be aware of its history and present conditions, political and cultural, so you can enjoy the environment safely and fully. If you are looking for a really ""hot"" Spring Break destination with a party and singles scene, these suggestions may not be right for you. But if you are more in need of a relaxing, refreshing getaway, here are a few recommendations for a fun, active spring getaway:Delray Beach, Florida I absolutely love the quaint feel of a beach town, especially one that offers great shopping and restaurants too, and Delray has it all. Whether shopping for new bathing suits or soaking up some sun and enjoying the white sandy beaches, there is plenty in Delray to keep you busy or quiet spots to relax and do nothing at all. On a recent trip there, I enjoyed an amazing, memorable late night meal at the Dada restaurant . It was the best late night spot I've ever experienced! Most times you have to settle for breakfast or greasy food, but Dada offered an eclectic menu and beautiful setting in a historic house. You can even rock on a porch swing with your significant other. There was live music and, for the price, the quality of the food couldn't be beat. Samaná, Dominican Republic If you are seeking adventure, you can enjoy a horseback ride through the rainforest, explore ancient caves or go whale watching. If you want to just kick back, visit its beautiful white beaches.Cartagena, Colombia If you want the city life and the Caribbean all in one dose, then Cartagena is the spot for you. Located on Colombia's northern coast, Cartagena boasts a lively urban scene in a beautiful setting. . Interested in pirate history? Cartagena was a hot spot for real-life pirates of the Caribbean, not just the Hollywood variety. It's a great place for sightseeing with its varied architecture, including Italian, French and Spanish Colonial style buildings.Medellín, Colombia   Another great Colombian destination, Medellín is one of the most beautiful cities in Latin America. If you are looking for an adventure, try your hand at tejo, the national sport. Referred to as lawn bowling, tejo is a favorite local pastime that elicits laughter and smiles from players and fans alike. The Medellín MetroCable offers breathtaking views and was named a top transport system in the world by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) in 2012. It's a great, affordable way to take in a scenic journey. There are so many wonderful places to explore in Medellín, such as the Jardín Botánico Joaquín Antonio Uribe, which contain hundreds of species of plants and trees and a beautiful lake. The Palacio de la Cultura Rafael Uribe Uribe, meaning the palace of culture, is a famous national monument that hosts concerts and art exhibitions.Liberia, Costa Rica If you are looking for white sand beaches and turquoise waters, look no farther than Liberia, Costa Rica. Here you'll explore an authentic Costa Rican town where you can sip on jugo de caña, sugar cane juice, and admire the Ciudad Blanca, the White City, filled with white houses. You can visit rainforests located just outside of the city or pristine beaches. Upon adventuring outside of the town, don't be surprised if you look up and see howler monkeys, more commonly known as congos. They actively swing from limb to limb in the treetops. One more tidbit, don't be upset if bird droppings hit your head. Supposedly, it represents good luck!I hope you have a wonderful spring trip, no matter where you travel!

Now, Gordon is opening up about the reason the former spouses -- and bandmates -- called it quits.In the latest issue of Elle, Gordon says her marriage ""ended in a kind of normal way -- midlife crisis, starstruck woman."" The article continues:Some years ago, a woman Gordon declines to name became a part of the Sonic Youth world, first as the girlfriend of an erstwhile band member and later as a partner on a literary project with Moore. Eventually, Gordon discovered a text message and confronted him about having an affair. They went to counseling, but he kept seeing the other woman. ""We never got to the point where we could just get rid of her so I could decide what I wanted to do,"" Gordon says. ""Thurston was carrying on this whole double life with her. He was really like a lost soul."" Moore moved out. Gordon stayed home and listened to a lot of hip-hop. ""Rap music is really good when you’re traumatized,"" she says.Gordon admits to dating since the separation, which she says is ""just weird."" And according to the feature, Moore has regularly been seen with the same woman -- perhaps the one who broke up the former couple's marriage.""It's a huge, drastic change,"" she says of the split. The former couple married in 1984 and have one daughter together, Coco, who is a freshman in college. The future of the band remains uncertain; in July 2012, Sonic Youth guitarist Lee Ranaldo told BBC radio that ""it's impossible to say what the future holds,"" and that perhaps the group was due for an ""extended break.""Click over to Elle for more on Gordon's life post-split, then browse through the slideshow below for other shocking splits of 2012.Keep in touch!

Coca-Cola Co., the world's largest soft-drink maker, may say profit rose on the second-biggest sales gain in three years as Europeans bought more no-calorie Coca-Cola Zero soda and the company sold more coffee in Japan.

Coke or Pepsi? Regular or diet? What's it called, anyway -- soda, pop or Coke? Those with answers are rarely meek in expressing them. These, they reason, are black and white issues. Choose a side and stick to it.It was in this spirit that HuffPost posed a new (and equally divisive) question: Which way is soda served best? In a bottle, can or from a fountain? Much as we suspected, the editors were vehemently split. A blind taste test, we reasoned, would be the only way to reach an answer. We used Coca-Cola as our test soft drink. But first, a few admissions. Number one, we're talking about plastic bottles, not glass bottles. Secondly, we assume that all bottles of Coca-Cola are alike and that the same goes for cans, but fountain drinks vary by establishment. It seems some stores use more syrup to flavor the drink, some less and mix this with varying levels of carbon dioxide. Fountain sodas are also most often served with ice -- as was ours, picked up from a nearby McDonald's -- which dilutes the drink. That's the appeal of fountain sodas to some, but we recognize that our tests aren't exactly scientific.That said, our results were interesting. Every editor who sampled the three sodas could easily tell the fountain soda from the rest, and about three quarters of the group found it inferior to the bottled and canned samples. ""Yuck,"" one editor wrote plainly. ""Flat and watery."" But other editors found these same characteristics pleasant. ""This tastes seriously watered down,"" an editor admitted. ""But because soda is way too sugary, I kind of prefer it this way. This must be fountain. WINNER in terms of drinkability.""Most editors had difficulty discerning the difference between the bottled and canned Coke. Those that could, however, were adamant about the canned version's superiority.""With bottled Coke, there's a plastic-y aftertaste. And there's a weird gas that seems to sit on top of the Coke and releases in the air the first time you unscrew the top,"" an editor wrote. ""I'll still drink it, but I always prefer Coke from the can. There's something crisper about the latter. And it's more addictive. It's particularly true with diet Coke from a can. It's like crack.""And so, our very unscientific ranking in order descending pleasantness is: 1) Can, 2) Bottle and 3) Fountain. Do you think we got it right?"
