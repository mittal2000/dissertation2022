That said, the stakes are much higher than even a prison sentence. Some may recall my piece in honor of the 4th of July, 2013 entitled ""Red, White and Waterless."" In it, I expressed deep concerns about the extended drought in the Western U.S. Some readers critiqued me for stating the obvious. I think those naysayers were part of the small but mighty choir that most of us environmental do-gooders preach to. The challenge at hand is to convince the greater population that water should be as highly prized as gasoline, if not more so. After all, you won't find fossil fuels on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  The reason I call this column ""Squeezing Water From a Rock"" is that I recently returned from a place that comes just short of this ultimate alchemy -- Israel, a small strip of desert, with no water or oil. Not an ideal place to build an agricultural oasis. But that is exactly what the Israeli water conservationists have accomplished.  A new greywater system has been established by the AIES Center for Trans-boundary Water Management. This is the first of six USAID funded systems. Photo courtesy of the Arava Institute.  I lived in Israel this past winter, working on my Fulbright Grant at Arava Institute for Environmental Studies. My assignment was to teach sessions on ""The Economics of Water as a Basic Human Right"" and ""The Feasibility of Small Sustainable Solutions for Marginalized People."" The latter focused on the plentiful, small waste water solutions found throughout the Negev desert and the West Bank. The Israeli Foreign Ministry funds a program called MASHAV which hosts environmental professionals from all over the developing world -- including Myanmar, Thailand, Cameroon, Ghana, Guyana, Bolivia, Nepal, Serbia, Bosnia and China, among others -- to learn about best practices in water management. Representatives from these varied nations descend upon Kibbutz Qetura to learn the ""secret sauce"" that turned Israel from water scarce to a desert oasis.  Evaporation pools of the Dead sea, Israel, shown here. Photo by Vadim Petrakov, Shutterstock.   Before I delve into a ""Water 101"" discourse, just a word about the Kibbutz. This was my first experience in Israel and I think the Kibbutz represents their success as a people -- based on a utopian model of living, Kibbutz's are agricultural communes (many have industry too, as in Qetura) in which everyone pitches in their fair share to keep the community tidy and pool everyone's income for the greater good. I also had opportunity to learn from leading experts in the world about water conservation and options to deal with scarcity. Israeli scientists and engineers use a very sophisticated blend of desalinization plants, wastewater recycling, drip water irrigation (the Israelis invented this technology which is now used worldwide), leak detection technologies and other pioneering techniques to bring a Garden of Eden to this dry, hot, arid piece of desert. As former Israeli Ambassador to France and Board Member of Arava Institute, Daniel Shek, so eloquently stated, ""Israel can live without rain. It is better if it does rain but it doesn't have to.""

The Israelis desalinate over 500 million cubic meters (one cubic meter equals 264 gallons) of fresh water per year, or 60,000 cubic meter per hour. Over 30 percent of Israel's drinking water comes from desalinization plants that transform salty Mediterranean Sea water to fresh, drinkable final product that rivals New York City's prized tap water in taste, purity and smoothness. The desalination process from intake to completion requires only 20 minutes. I visited Ashkelon, Israel's $300 million plus desalination plant which produces clean drinking water for 50 cents U.S. per cubic meter -- the lowest cost in the world for desalinated water. Israel has centralized its wastewater and desalination distribution systems, which are managed by public-private partnerships overseen by the government. I was fortunate to catch up with Abraham Tenne, Head of Desalination for the Israeli Water Ministry and he stated, As long as you have an ocean and you treat the saltwater, you can use it. Desalination is the answer everywhere. Population is growing, over seven billion people on this planet now and nine billion expected by 2050. Existing water resources are tapped. Desalination combined with waste water treatment and conservation are no longer optional.Of course, desalinization is not necessarily a be-all-end-all solution. It requires massive amounts of electricity and/or fossil fuels to run the plants. Another conundrum of using desalination for irrigation is that farmers don't like water that has been cleansed of all its minerals including the salt. Also, boron is present in desalination, which can inhibit plant growth. A cracked soil pattern caused by drought in the Zin Valley, Arava, Israel. Photo by Noam Armonn, Shutterstock. Exporting this knowhow and expertise could potentially spread goodwill throughout the world for Israel. Larry Gross, a Venture Capitalist in Southern California who is also an expert on native Israeli technology, commented on this concept. ""Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the (U.S.) West Coast this past March. This was the first time in eight years the Israeli Prime Minister has visited California, and when he met with Governor Jerry Brown, the subject matter at hand was adjusting to long-standing drought conditions."" This is but one example of how Israel might help itself in the court of public opinion through its knowledge of water conservation.  Israel's fresh water challenges -- actually the entire Mideast except Lebanon is considered water scarce -- are many. Supply erodes while demand grows. Climate change has impacted water supply: since 1997, water availability has dropped from 1.17B cubic meters to 870M cubic meters, according to Arava Institute's water management specialist, Clive Lipchin.  Water Management at the Arava Institute provides a platform for regional water professionals and policy makers to cooperate in water conservation efforts. Photo courtesy of the Arava Institute. Admittedly, Israel is thimble-sized at only 263 miles long and 71 miles at its widest point. Thus managing a nationalized grid system, and building the infrastructure needed to process and transport the water there is far simpler than it would be in the U.S. And it should be noted, there are virtually no private water rights in Israel. That said, we can still learn from the example set by Israel. Water is treated as a truly precious resource, and the clear and strong national policy makes it possible to provide water at low, low prices even in the midst of a desert.  The cost of drinking water per cubic meter for several major cities. Data from Global Water Intel, 2011. Abraham Tenne astutely observed, This year was the driest winter ever in Israel -- same with California; however, Israel had foresight and prepared for these conditions by optimizing desalination, wastewater, and conservation practices. California was busy for 15 years contemplating whether desalination was a viable option, they lost valuable time. They are finally addressing desalination at a meaningful level in Carlsbad, California. Although, they will need 10X this amount of desalinized water to meet demand. California was late to the party.I also observed firsthand an almost rabid devotion to wastewater recycling and reuse. Nearly 90 percent of Israel's domestic sewage is treated, mostly at monolithic facilities in the Dan region just south of Tel Aviv. Wastewater is processed, treated, and reused for irrigation. I think we Californians and Nevadans can learn something from this. Israel is gradually replacing fresh water with treated wastewater for agricultural purposes (today around 50 percent of water for irrigation is fresh water, whereas in most parts of the world, including in the U.S. it is 70 percent and above). It would be wise for us to pursue this practice here in the U.S. not to mention other countries facing similar realities. It is hard to comprehend that more countries do not embrace this practice. Spain is a distant second with recycling 18 percent of their wastewater; the U.S. is at one percent.  Water efficiency is also high in Israel, only 10 percent lost through pipes; neighbors like Syria and Lebanon lose around 50 percent through pipes; the U.S. loses 15 percent through old infrastructure. London also loses around 50 percent due to outdated infrastructure although Israeli companies like TaKaDu, a company that specializes in identifying existing and future leaks in infrastructure, are helping to resolve this age old problem.  Israel, like developing countries, uses most of its water for agricultural purposes. This is in contrast to most developed countries who use the majority of their water for industry. Chart courtesy of Centre for Science and Environment, India.   So we and others could use some help from Israel. But would we and other water scarce countries be willing to accept their patronage? Does the nature of water, our very life source, transcend the polarizing politics of the Middle East? Is it possible that this life and death issue can supersede politics and prejudice? While this remains to be seen, all I know is that without viable solutions to this problem, the next century could be ripe for military conflict around water rights. This is why i say that water is the new oil, the only difference being it takes a lot of water to process a barrel of oil. Perhaps we are in store for a new type of peace process, one that considers transfer of knowledge regarding water practices? Shek concurred, ""this is already occurring but mostly behind closed doors, countries asking for help may not publicize their relationship with Israel, however, we are hopeful that through sharing best practices, water can become a tool for peace, after all, our lives depend on it.""  As always, we welcome your comments!"

It is obvious to me we need to move forward and get the embargo taken away,"" he told Maher.State governors have no authority over U.S. foreign policy, but Crist's stand could undermine political support for the embargo, especially if he wins in November.Lifting the embargo would take an act of Congress and supporters say it should not be removed until Cuba's one-party political system is abolished.Opponents, including an increasing number of Cuban Americans and some dissidents in Cuba, argue that the island's communist rulers have used the embargo as an excuse for its economic woes, and a justification for tight control on political freedoms.Setting foot in Cuba has been off limits for most Florida politicians, though Kathy Castor, a Democratic congresswoman for Tampa, made a fact-finding trip to the island last year.Public opinion in the state has shifted enough in recent years that Democratic party activist Alejandro Miyar, said ""the idea of engaging Cuba is less of a third rail in Florida politics than ever before.""Miyar, 33, who is the son of Cuban exiles, said Crist's trip ""shows a lot of courage and conviction to engage an issue that has been traditionally difficult for Florida politicians.""But the re-election campaign of incumbent Florida Governor Rick Scott was quick to jump on the Cuba trip.""It just reflects Charlie Crist's ignorance about what is happening on the island and the history of the last 60 years,"" Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera told Reuters.Lopez-Cantera, 40, who is also the son of Cuban exiles, said the proposed trip was ""a tremendous insult"" to Cuban Americans who had voted in the past for Crist, a former Republican governor of the state who switched parties last year.""He keeps evolving and devolving. Maybe he's going down there to explore becoming a communist,"" Lopez-Cantera added.Recent polls have shown steadily weakening support for hardline U.S.-Cuba policy. An Atlantic Council poll in February showed a strong majority of Americans supported normalizing relations with Cuba. Cuban Americans have been visiting the island in record numbers after the Obama administration lifted travel restrictions for exile family visits in 2009. (Editing by Eric Walsh)"
2,IMPACT,Haiyan Six Months On: A Promising Start on the Long Road to Recovery,"Helen Clark, ContributorAdministrator, United Nations Development Programme",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/haiyan-six-months-on-a-pr_b_5291173.html,"Six months after one of the strongest tropical storms ever recorded on earth slammed into the Philippines last November, the physical signs of recovery are increasingly visible.",2014-05-08,"The coastline of Tacloban City on May 7, 2014, still bears scars from the massive damage left by Super Typhoon Haiyan that devastated the central Philippine city six months ago. The storm, the strongest ever to hit land, left more than 7,000 dead or missing and ravaged whole cities when it struck on November 8, 2013. Aid officials say that the affected areas have made a remarkable recovery but years of hard work still lie ahead before the area is restored to normal. AFP PHOTO / MARLON TANO (Photo credit should read MARLON TANO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c2d5200000e500ffbecc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Six months after one of the strongest tropical storms ever recorded on earth slammed into the Philippines last November, killing more than 6,200 people and displacing over 4 million, the physical signs of recovery are increasingly visible. The Philippines authorities at all levels and affected communities have played a powerful role, both in the immediate response to the disaster, which included successfully evacuating hundreds of thousands of people to safety, and in spearheading recovery. Roads have been cleared, over 120,000 households have received help to rebuild, with 15 percent of homes now repaired, and nearly all the damaged schools and hospitals have re-opened. While the costs of the disaster are better understood after six months, the human suffering continues to take its toll. People who were already tackling extreme poverty, including many living in the Eastern Visayas region, now face a future without the security of their farms, employment opportunities, or long-term economic prospects. Rebuilding these communities could span a decade or more. While the response of the international community to the immediate emergency has been generous, post-disaster recovery requires long-term engagement. Recovery is about more than the vital task of building homes and structures. It is also about building greater resilience to natural hazards. Disasters exacerbate inequality and deepen poverty. Effective disaster risk reduction measures and comprehensive social protection can reduce the vulnerability of those most at risk. After the immediate relief phase in the Philippines, real recovery can be based on building back sustainably and improving on what existed before. This is very much what The Philippines authorities are planning for.Typhoon Haiyan affected more than 142,000 fishermen, with some areas losing 95 percent of their commercial boats and equipment. The heavy reliance on a single income stream made entire communities vulnerable to severe economic pressure. Recovery that is focused on building resilience, however, can help communities diversify their incomes and range of economic activities. In this way, local economies will be better able to bounce back from future disasters. In many countries, natural hazards pose frequent risks. The Philippines, battered by an average of 20 large-scale storms a year, is no exception. Investments in preparedness for these events and adaptation to ongoing risks are vital. Improved infrastructure design, for example, can help save lives and protect development gains. Effective disaster risk reduction requires the authorities to prioritize planning for disasters before they happen and build capacities for mitigation of their effects. Wide engagement of communities helps -- all have a role to play in responding to disaster and managing the risks. Bringing people together to explore new solutions which address risk in the most comprehensive manner is a sound approach to building greater resilience.Early warning systems need to be strengthened to limit the impact of disasters and to ensure that communities are alerted in time. They do, however, need continuous maintenance and regular testing. The latest technology to track and monitor upcoming storms will not save lives unless those who operate them are trained, local governments receive urgent updates on developments, and the population knows how to react in an emergency. Looking ahead, disaster risk reduction must be central to all future development that takes place in the Philippines. For example, as new schools are built, they needs to be earthquake and climate-proofed. When the authorities support farmers to access new crop varieties, those crops should be more climate resilient, including by having a shorter harvest cycle after replanting. In some places affected by Typhoon Haiyan, critical government infrastructure was damaged and many government workers consequently left the area. This has affected the delivery of government services, such as education and healthcare and exacerbated the deprivation caused by the storm. UNDP is working to help the government address this and other issues which affect the pace of recovery.It is important to always be mindful that the needs of those who have been affected by the profound crisis of Haiyan must be at the front and center of the response and recovery. Many of the survivors were also first responders. They displayed both enormous courage and solidarity with those who had lost loved ones. They helped family, friends, and neighbors before humanitarian aid arrived, and they continue to provide support to this day. Extraordinary stories of human resilience fill us with hope. Even in the midst of great loss, the people of the Philippines are seizing the opportunity to build a better life in any way they can. I saw this resilience for myself on my visit to the devastated areas of Tacloban in recent weeks. We can all support their dream of a better future if we stay engaged with the long road to recovery.For more information or to donate to UNDP's recovery efforts in the Philippines, visit here."

And it sets the stage for more than two dozen other states that are currently considering mandatory labeling of such GMO foods.""Vermonters will have the right to know what's in their food,"" Shumlin told cheering supporters in a speech on the state House steps. ""We are pro-information. Vermont gets it right with this bill.""Shumlin said the state had set up a ""food fight fund"" to take online donations to help defend the law from litigation expected to be filed by food industry interests to block the law.Consumer groups and lawmakers supporting such mandatory labeling say there is no scientific consensus on whether or not genetically engineered crops are safe, and consumers should be able to easily distinguish products containing GMOs so they can avoid them if they wish.The consumer sentiment has pushed a growing number of U.S. food companies to start using non-genetically modified ingredients for their products because of the consumer backlash against GMOs.But the food and agriculture industries, including the makers of genetically modified corn, soybeans, canola and other crops widely used in packaged foods, are fighting mandatory labeling of GMOs. They say their products are proven safe, and that such labels will imply they are unsafe, confusing consumers and increasing costs for consumers as well as farmers and food companies.""Scientific bodies and regulatory officials around the world recognize that foods made from genetically modified (GM) crops are as safe as their non-GM counterparts,"" said Cathleen Enright, executive vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO). ""GM crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications, less water and reduced on-farm fuel use.""BIO, a trade group whose members include Monsanto Co , Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical Co, and other biotech seed companies said food costs for an average household would rise as $400 per year due to mandatory labeling.BIO and the Grocery Manufacturers Association are backing a proposed federal law that would nullify Vermont's labeling law and any other mandatory labeling of GMOs in the United States.Both sides of the debate claims science supports their views. Last October, a group of 93 international scientists said there was a lack of empirical and scientific evidence to support what they said were false claims by the biotech industry about a ""consensus"" on safety.

In her most important and profound speech since leaving the State Department, Clinton touted the benefits of ObamaCare and warned about the culture of gun violence that has killed far too many of America's children. Speaking to the National Council for Behavioral Health, she called for redoubled efforts to redress economic inequality and a return to a society in which Americans care about one another, in an economy with rising tides that lift all boats.The battle is joined. The GOP addresses its partisan and extreme right-wing base with a venom toward others that mocks the legacies of Abe Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. Clinton addresses the nation as a whole in tones reminiscent of Pope Francis, calling for a nation where no girls or boys have shorter life expectancies than their moms or dads. She champions an economy where aspirations grow higher while the number of jobless falls lower. She stands for politics where data and facts replace delusion and deceit. She proposes a discourse where mutual respect replaces the negativity and hatred that are trademarks of the modern Republican Party.While the GOP looks downward and backward in its negative politics of derision, aiming its appeal to an extremist faction, Clinton reaches outward and forward in her positive politics of opportunity, aiming her appeal to the nation at large. If she runs in 2016, she could well carry 45 states and sweep into office many Democrats running for the House, Senate and governorships.Ignore the vast wasteland of political ""reporting"" about a potential Clinton candidacy, such as the idiot punditry about Monica Lewinsky and the irrelevant bromides about who is allegedly up or down on Planet Hillary. Consider carefully, instead, what Clinton is saying this week.Benghazi? We do not have enough fingers on our hand to count the House Republican committees that have investigated Benghazi.But even after all of these sham public relations operations -- sandwiched between long House Republican recesses and vacations -- potential 2016 GOP candidates cannot see the color of Clinton's pantsuit because she is running so far ahead of them.ObamaCare? Clinton understands that by November 2016 there will be 12 million people, or perhaps 15 million or more, signed up along with children covered under a parent's policy.The Republican nightmare is Clinton in 2016 accusing the party that wants to cut Social Security and Medicare of trying to force 12-15 million consumers to give up health care plans they purchased, trying to strip people with preexisting conditions of the insurance ObamaCare provided, and telling millions of parents that their kids lose the insurance that ObamaCare gave them.Medicaid? Let right-wing Republicans tell voters why they hurt their state budgets and poor folks by refusing to accept federal Medicaid money.War against women? Let Republicans tell voters why Clinton is wrong about pay equity, better child care, paid parental leave and more help for poor women who deserve better than hungry children and premature death.Jobs? Minimum wage? Income inequality? The GOP is busy creating jobs for GOP hacks working for partisan committees investigating Benghazi ad nauseam and for GOP flacks writing press releases advocating the repeal of ObamaCare health plans consumers want. Meanwhile, Clinton is envisioning an America where parents don't have to worry about their children being gunned down in school, workers don't have to worry about being left behind in an economy without jobs, politics is not poisoned by hatred, and our social fabric is not torn apart by economic inequality and social injustice.This week, Americans heard Republicans talk about Benghazi while Clinton talked about them. Upon such things historic landslides and realignments are born. Republicans, consider yourselves warned."

Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut will hold three events, one focused on campus safety laws the Clery and Campus SaVe Acts, one on the gender equity law Title IX and a third on how both colleges and the criminal justice system respond to campus rape. The announcement of the round-table discussions comes just a week after the release of a White House task force report on college sexual assault. It also follows a ramp-up in congressional attention to the issue. All three senators have major universities in their home states that have been accused of mishandling sexual assault cases, and each lawmaker has signaled that they plan to file legislation on the issue.""It's clear we have a lot of work to do to tackle the systemic issues that prevent victims from reporting these crimes, that prevent schools from effectively protecting these victims, and prevent clear and proper enforcement of federal law,"" McCaskill said in a statement. ""These meetings will help us understand, from those who know best, what more we can do for students, administrators and law enforcement to give them the tools they need to curb this epidemic.""Although the White House recently detailed a series of steps it plans to take through the Justice and Education Departments, and although the Campus SaVE Act -- arguably the most significant reform to laws governing college rape in a generation -- passed just last year, the senators still see room for further action.The report from the White House task force includes little in the way of specific proposals for legislation.

""I think first this is one of those good areas in which bipartisanship can be reached because public safety is not a partisan issue,"" Meehan said in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""There's also an interest by our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both understanding the problem more and pursuing wherever the legislative opportunities arise.""Laura Dunn, a campus sexual assault survivor who started the nonprofit SurvJustice, agreed that it was appropriate for the task force not to press harder for specific legislative action.""The White House only has so much power, so it's very much purposeful certain things are left out,"" said Dunn, who helped lobby for the passage of the Campus SaVE Act. ""That being said, the White House has significant power to demand increased enforcement of existing laws.""Many of McCaskill, Gillibrand and other lawmakers' efforts on the college sexual assault issue have attracted bipartisan support. Last month, Gillibrand and Blumenthal sent a bipartisan letter to the White House calling for a restructuring of how the Education Department handles sexual assault reviews, and for a national survey of students on sexual violence. Both ideas were mentioned in the task force's report.In January, a bipartisan coalition in the House, which included Meehan, called upon the Education Department to disclose which colleges are under Title IX investigation, a step the department took last week.Survivor activists who have spoken with HuffPost say McCaskill and Gillibrand's staffs have remained in touch with them for the past few months, soliciting input on what potential legislation might look like. Some of those same survivors, along with experts on the topic, are expected to be invited to the round-table discussions, which will take place on May 19, June 2 and June 16. "

Carrying their rifles and small bags of belongings, hundreds of exhausted Syrian rebels withdrew Wednesday from their last remaining strongholds in the heart of Homs, surrendering to President Bashar Assad a bloodstained city that was once the center of the revolt against him. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc135d7230000330093cb07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Marwan MakdesiHOMS, Syria May 8 (Reuters) - Syrian forces took full control on Thursday over Homs, a city once associated with scenes of joyous pro-democracy crowds but now famed for images of ruin that epitomize the brutality of Syria's civil war.After holding the Old City of Homs for nearly two years, around 1,200 rebel fighters and trapped civilians boarded buses which took them out of the ""capital of the revolution"" in convoys on Wednesday and Thursday, activists said.They were driven to rebel-held territory outside the city under a deal agreed between the insurgents and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.""Old Homs has been completely cleansed of armed terrorist groups,"" state television said.Homs provincial governor Talal Barazi told Reuters earlier on Thursday that Homs would be ""declared a secure city"" and reconstruction would commence after the evacuation.Although the area had been cleared of insurgents, the army is not expected to move into the Old City until Friday when it will be checked for explosives.Rebels smiled to cameras as they left, but the fall of Syria's third largest city to government forces is a major blow to the opposition and a boost for Assad weeks before his likely re-election.When thousands of Syrians took to the streets of Homs in 2011, it electrified the nation and anti-Assad demonstrations erupted in every major city. Government forces cracked down on the religiously mixed city with batons and live ammunition.Mortar bombs were fired on protests in Homs and the revolution became armed. Rebel groups spread through the city as civilians fled or cowered in the basements of battered buildings. A year ago, government forces laid siege to the Old City and residents said they starved.On Thursday, the city was close to silent with no sound of gunfire or explosions. Many buildings at the entrance to the Old City district lay in ruins, destroyed by three years of fighting.Lebanon's al-Manar television aired footage from Homs of a line of rebel fighters, some carrying guns and wearing scarves around their faces, walking to green buses, passing government troops. ASSAD GAINSAt the same time as rebels were evacuated from Homs, dozens of captives held by rebels in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Latakia were freed as part of the same deal.Governor Barazi told state media that 70 people abducted by rebels were released, including five children and 17 women, and state television said more people were later released from Latakia on Thursday.The Homs evacuation comes after months of gains by the army, backed by its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, along a strategic corridor of territory linking the capital Damascus with Homs and on to Assad's Alawite heartland on the Mediterranean.Assad's forces now control most of the capital, along with the main highway from Damascus to the coast, while rebels control much of the desert in the north and east. Syria's second city, Aleppo in the northwest, is contested.Many areas in Homs province remain in rebel hands, including the stronghold town of Rastan, and Assad will also need to secure rural areas around the capital to take full control of areas the Syrian army has been battling for. Government forces have also lost ground in the south to Islamist brigades.Assad is widely expected to be the runaway victor in the June 3 presidential vote, which his opponents at home and abroad have dismissed as a charade.They say no credible election can be held in a country fractured by civil war, with swathes of territory outside government control, 6 million people displaced and another 2.5 million refugees abroad.More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict. Millions more have fled their homes and fighting regularly kills more than 200 people a day. (Writing by Oliver Holmes; Editing by Alastair Macdonald)"

Pumpjacks are used to mechanically pump oil and natural gas out of the earth when there is not enough natural pressure for the liquids to rise on their own. North Dakota has been experiencing an oil boom recently, brining tens of thousands of jobs to the region, lowering state unemployment and bringing a surplus to the state budget. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30c45260000cf008203da.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 4,600 U.S. workers were killed on the job and an estimated 50,000 died from occupational diseases during 2012, a new report from the AFL-CIO labor federation found.The federation's annual report, Death on the Job, analyzes the most recent data on workplace deaths and injuries available from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report released Thursday noted that the death rate among U.S. workers has trended downward long-term, though that progress has recently ebbed. ""Over the years, clearly the United States has made progress in protecting workers,"" said Peg Seminario, director of safety and health at the AFL-CIO, on a call with reporters Thursday. ""But today the numbers of workers being killed and injured is still too high and unacceptable. Over the last several years, the rate for injuries and illnesses has essentially flatlined.""In the AFL-CIO's analysis, North Dakota was by far the country's deadliest state to be working in, with 17.7 workers killed per 100,000. That's compared to a national rate of 3.4 deaths per 100,000. North Dakota was followed by Wyoming, at 12.2 deaths per 100,000, and Alaska, at 8.9 deaths per 100,000.Seminario attributed the high worker fatality rate in North Dakota to the state's oil-and-gas boom, which has lured young workers from throughout the country with the promise of good-paying jobs.""North Dakota really stood out as a state that's deadly and dangerous for workers,"" Seminario said. ""Workers who work in oil and gas extraction are at very, very high risk.""So, in general, are Latinos. Consistent with years past, the analysis found that Latino workers were more likely than white workers to get hurt or killed on the job, with a fatality rate of 3.7 per 100,000 -- a factor Seminario attributed in part to the weaker work protections for undocumented immigrants. That death rate, however, has fallen by 38 percent since 2001. The AFL-CIO praised the administration of President Barack Obama for stepping up enforcement of safety laws and adding more workplace inspectors, but it also criticized the White House for not moving fast enough on occupational health and safety rules. In particular, Seminario urged the White House to enact a final rule tightening standards on silica dust.For decades silica has been known to cause debilitating lung conditions, including lung cancer, and occupational health experts have long called for regulators to lower the amount of silica dust legally allowed in the air on construction sites. After years of delay, the White House finally issued its proposal for new regulations, but the final rule still hasn't gone into effect. Industry trade groups have been lobbying to water it down.On Thursday's press call, Sean Barrett, a terrazzo worker from Massachusetts, called on the White House to put the new silica rule on the books. Barrett, who's 41, said his doctor has diagnosed him with industrial asthma brought on by workplace silica exposure. He already suffers from shortness of breath.""I love my job, and I take a lot of pride in it,"" Barrett said. ""No worker should have to get sick or die to earn an honest day's pay."""

Fewer Americans identify with the Tea Party, but those who do are especially enthusiastic about voting in 2014. And we just can't stop talking about turnout. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, May 8, 2014. UKRAINIANS FAVOR UNIFIED STATE - Pew Research Global Attitudes Project: ""A clear majority of Ukrainians agree that their country should remain a single, unified state, according to a pair of new surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center in Ukraine and Russia – after Crimea’s annexation by Russia, but prior to recent violence in Odessa and other cities. The survey in Ukraine also finds a clearly negative reaction to the role Russia is playing in the country. By contrast, the poll in Russia reveals a public that firmly backs Vladimir Putin and Crimea’s secession from Ukraine...Ukrainians are far from satisfied with the involvement of foreign powers to date. The European Union fares best in the eyes of Ukrainians, with a 45%-plurality describing its influence in Ukraine as good. Meanwhile, assessments of the U.S. impact on Ukraine are split: 38% positive, 38% negative. Russia is viewed with the greatest suspicion. Three times as many Ukrainians say Russia is having a bad influence on their country as say it is having a good impact (67% vs. 22%)."" [Pew Research]How did Pew survey a country 'stricken by violence and unrest?' James Bell, Pew Research’s director of international survey research, explains: ""In Ukraine, as in many other countries around the globe, our surveys are conducted face-to-face, rather than by telephone. This means that interviewers are assigned the task of walking through neighborhoods and knocking on doors to randomly select survey participants. Being out on the street can be risky at times, especially in a restive country like Ukraine. I want to stress that Pew Research always puts interviewer safety first...If we judge conditions in a country to be too dangerous, we will either delay or cancel the project."" In this case Pew Research did not exclude Crimea or other parts of the country due to violence or security threats, however: ""We encountered one instance where a driver on his way to deliver completed questionnaires to the central office was stopped at a roadblock. Unidentified men seized a packet of questionnaires and burnt it on the spot. The driver was not detained and left the scene unharmed. This occurred in the early days of fieldwork, and the lost questionnaires were replaced by interviewers returning to the original neighborhoods and re-administering the survey."" [Pew Research]TEA PARTY SUPPORT CONTINUES TO DECLINE - Frank Newport: ""About four in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents classify themselves as supporters of the Tea Party, while 11% are opponents and 48% are neither. This continues to be a significant drop from the Tea Party's high-water mark in November 2010, when 61% of Republicans were supporters of the Tea Party….The broad group of Republicans who are supporters of the Tea Party are remarkably similar to other Republicans across most demographic categories -- including race and ethnicity, income, age, education, or region of country. Republican Tea Party supporters are somewhat more likely to be weekly church attenders and slightly more likely to be men.What then are the key factors that separate Republicans who support the Tea Party and those who do not? The answer to that question revolves mainly around ideology. Over half of Republicans who self-identify as conservatives are supporters of the Tea Party. Support for the Tea Party drops to 23% among moderate and liberal Republicans....[Yet] Republican Tea Party supporters have given the election more thought, and also are significantly more likely to say they are more enthusiastic about voting, than either other Republicans or non-Republicans. [Gallup]30 PERCENT WILL VOTE TO OPPOSE OBAMA - Andrew Dugan: ""Three in 10 registered voters say when they vote for a candidate in the fall midterm elections, it will be to send a message that they oppose U.S. President Barack Obama, equal to the amount who said this before the Republican wave election of 2010. Nearly a quarter, 24%, say they are voting to support Obama, also similar to 2010. The largest number of voters, however, say their vote will not be a reflection on the president."" [Gallup]TURNOUT NOT AS IMPORTANT AS DC WAGS CLAIM - So says Harry Enten: ""The demographics of who voted in 2012 vs. 2010 were different, but that difference didn’t make much of a difference. The reason Republicans won more votes in 2010 — and likely will in 2014 — is that voters wanted Republicans in office, not that minorities and young people didn’t turn out to vote."" Using statistics drawn from the Census' Current Population Surveys on voting from 2010 and 2012, Enten attempts to apply the 2010 turnout to the 2012 vote, and vice versa. ""In this hypothetical 2010 [based on 2012 turnout], Republicans would have won the national House vote by 4.1 points and taken somewhere in the neighborhood of 232 seats, good enough for a 53-seat gain. The more robust the math, the more solid the GOP’s lead. The same thing works in reverse, when we take 2010’s turnout rates and apply them to 2012. With just midterm voters casting a ballot, President Obama would have won the national vote in 2012 by 1.2 points. That’s 2.7 points less than his actual margin in 2012, but it’s more than enough to have carried the election. It’s not that the demographic splits of voter turnout don’t matter. They worked in Republicans’ favor in 2010 and in Democrats’ favor in 2012; demographics just weren’t the reason either party won. What really mattered was that voters changed their minds about which party they wanted to vote for."" [538]Nate Cohn agrees - Via Twitter, The New York Times' Nate Cohn offers ""3 thoughts"" about his ""apparent disagreement"" with Enten's article: ""1) Despite framing, we agree: his piece says midterm turnout costs Ds 2.7 pts, my estimate was 3 pts....2) In states where Ds depend more on young, non-white voters, like NC, turnout costs...3) If the race for Senate is as close as [the NYT and] 538 [models] estimate, a 3 pt turnout gap is easily decisive. Models don't really account for it."" [@Nate_Cohn here, here and here]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday via email!

But President Barack Obama refused to “liberate” him, he told Andrew Ross Sorkin in a New York Times Magazine profile published online Thursday. The former chair of the New York Federal Reserve is pushing his new memoir, “Stress Test,” which is due to be published May 12. In it, he seems to paint himself as the reluctant pragmatist who steered the country clear of financial devastation.Key word: Reluctant. After he flubbed his first speech in 2009, Geithner told Rahm Emanuel, then Obama’s chief of staff, he would step down. But Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, said “finding a new Treasury secretary wasn’t the solution.""He said he hadn’t even wanted the job in the first place, and apparently stumped for former Treasury secretary Larry Summers when he met with Obama soon after the 2008 election. His wife, Carole, didn’t want him to take the job, either.“Carole didn’t just have reservations,” Geithner writes in the memoir. “She was opposed.”After years of trying to convince the public that the financial crisis bank bailouts were profitable -- they were -- Geithner's slated to make big profits of his own. He's joined private equity firm Warburg Pincus last month, a move that earned him new criticism.“I think the perception problem -- first of all it’s very damaging to me as I was trying to do some tough things, and I think it’s kind of very damaging to the country at the moment because it sees this basic loss of faith in government,” he told the Times. “I thought the only thing I could really do about that was to make sure I didn’t go work for a bank or a firm that we’d regulated or that we’d rescued directly.”Read the full New York Times Magazine profile here"
