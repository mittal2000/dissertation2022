To me, there's nothing more motivating than a fresh start. I'm a writer, so I know that the ""real writing"" takes place in the re-writing. I've learned that we don't have to be bogged down by the past, the shame of regret or the endless shoulda, woulda, coulda. We can lighten our load by mentally stepping into a brand new day, free of the baggage of a broken past. It takes some skill and practice, but when you are starting over, learning how to recover from the loss is vital. Here are some tools for getting over The Tool. 1. Sit down and shut up. This is also known as meditating. The one thing that helps me calm down and eliminate stress is lighting a candle and staring into space. Find a comfortable sitting position, lift through your lower back, relax your shoulders and lengthen the back of your neck. This puts you in a position of sitting up straight so you can gaze confidently into the unknown. Breathe deeply into your belly, and silently inhale the word ""thank."" Then, silently exhale the word ""you."" This is a mantra for the mind to focus on gratitude. Allow your mind to see people, places and things that belong with this breath of thanks. It's quite impossible to stay in fear and resentment when you are consciously going through your gratitude list. When you have said ""Thank You"" to all in your life, then blow out the candle and embrace your day.2. Make a list. Lists are the quintessential way to make sure youʼve accomplished something tangible. Make a list of lists i.e., The Money Making List, The Phone Call List, The Things I've Been Putting Off List, The Things I Haven't Gotten To Do, Yet Still Want To List. Then start doing it. Do the last thing first, then everything else will seem easier. The best part is checking off the list, then rejoicing in the happy baby dance. 3. Go out and play. It's pretty difficult to be pissed off in nature. If you are going nuts in the forest, nature will not go nuts with you. It will support you by remaining still, or by allowing a gentle breeze to blow the nuts away. Nature does not stress about yesterday or worry about tomorrow, it lives and trusts that the sun will rise, the water will come, the wind will blow and all will be fine. It trusts in the fact that it carries on; regardless of stormy weather, nature prevails. So go out and take a walk in a garden, just take only pictures, leave only footprints and put out your fires.4. Call a friend. This can be tricky in divorce, because we tend to lose certain friendships surrounding the demise of a relationship. There might be the friends who are still questioning why you got a divorce, or the ones who are still bad mouthing your ex. ""Endless advice friend"" is not the one, neither is the ""yes man friend."" Call the friend that makes you laugh and lightens your heart and encourages you to make strong, healthy choices. The best friend to call is the one who celebrates you, not tolerates you. You can go through your phone book and check off exactly who makes you feel good about yourself and who makes you feel like you need to take a hot bath. 5. Don't Cyberstalk. If you're fresh out of a failed relationship, move on and leave it alone. If you have to make contact, do it with minimal texts and even less emails. In today's world, it's easy to spy and harass -- but it's not healthy. It really makes you look crazy, especially with the law. In fact, the law has some serious consequences for harassing an ex, especially if you have dated him, lived with him, been married to him or had a child with him. There are steep fines and prison time associated with cyber stalking. For the cold, hard facts, check out this site. Going to prison for hiding behind a computer screen to vent is a lousy way to start over.6. If this is difficult for you, go back to 1. and repeat."

The day after Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the Christmas shopping season in the U.S. (Photo by Carlo Allegri/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5df63c0000660009bb41.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two weeks ago I took my grandkids shopping for a little back-to-school treat for each of them. We walked in wearing flip-flops and before I had taken my sunglasses off, the kids were pointing at the Christmas trees, hopping up and down asking, ""Grandma Neale, is there gonna be snow when we get home?"" I know I'm not as young as I like to think I am, but did I miss Columbus Day? Halloween? Oh no! Did I sleep through Thanksgiving? Now, I know that retailers try to hypnotize us to buy more, but Christmas in September just isn't working for me. Wal-Mart has already started its holiday layaway. The Toys ""R"" Us website has its ""hot toy reservation"" program which they say will make you a ""holiday hero."" For the next 100 days, our kids and grandkids are going to be nagging, ""How many days before Santa?"" How many months of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Up on the Rooftop"" should any store clerk be expected to endure?I'm afraid that instead of talking about summer vacation, kids will be splitting up into groups to work on their Christmas wish lists. Our kids are missing the chance to enjoy all the holidays. Just because you don't get a gift under the Jack O'Lantern doesn't make it any less special!HO HO HOLD EVERYTHING!Here are my top five lessons to put the joy IN and take the debt OUT of the holiday season: 1. Pay It Now Don't go into debt because of poor planning. Make a budget and help your kids with their own budgets. One year I decided to freeze my credit cards in a block of ice so I couldn't be tempted by impulse shopping. I could only spend cash. Just remember that in a moment of weakness you can't thaw the cards in the microwave... I hear it ruins the magnetic strip on the back!   2. Gift Giving Gift exchange isn't an Olympic sport. One year I sent my daughter to a birthday party with a nice hat and scarf set as a gift. When that kid came to my daughter's birthday party she brought a complete stereo setup. She was 10 years old. My daughter was thrilled... me, not so much. We called the parents, thanked them for the thought but asked them to please take it back. The next day I called all the other parents and had them agree to a spending limit for gifts. 3. Giving of Yourself A gift should say ""I care"" and not ""look how much I spent."" Whatever happened to homemade gifts, especially for grandparents and other family members? I will always cherish the ashtray my daughter made for me one year in arts and crafts. It doesn't even matter that I have never smoked. Giving also means giving to charity and volunteering is a great way to give back. For several years my kids and I helped serve holiday dinner at a homeless shelter. This is a great way to remember the spirit of Christmas.4. Gift Getting One year, when my son was 7 or 8, a family friend gave him one of those Chia things -- this one was a bald head that you spread seeds on and watched the ""hair"" grow. I closely watched his expression as he unwrapped the gift and I saw that look on his face. Mothers, you know that look. I was pretty sure I was going to have to fake a heart attack in order to stop my kid from saying something that would embarrass all of us. Awkward! I was so proud when my son managed to say quite convincingly, ""Thank you, I never thought I would get one of these,"" and there wasn't even a hint of sarcasm in his voice. Whew, he remembered to be gracious. You have to do a lot of rehearsing and role-playing so that everyone remembers it really is the thought that counts.5. Making a List and Checking It Twice You and your kids need to make lists of what you want to buy and for whom -- to keep you on budget. Put your kids to work as ""gift detectives"" and have them secretly find out what grandparents and friends might want as a gift and then you can sit down with them and go over the list. Group gifts are a good thing. Your kids can pool their money and give one gift to the grandparents, perhaps something you can all make together. Give your kids jobs to do. Get them involved. Remember, every gift they wrap is one less for you to wrap. We can all be holiday heroes by keeping things in perspective and welcoming the holidays at our own pace. Don't let anyone try to make us celebrate the 4th of July in April."

Rowling has declined a trip into space that was offered to her for £2 million ($3,222,600,) reports the Irish Independent.""I was offered a seat. For a mere £2 million I could have been on the shuttle, but I turned it down,"" she is quoted as saying to fans at a book event. It's unlikely she meant the  space shuttle, since, as The Examiner points out: ""NASA has never sold seats on space shuttle flights nor has allowed any other entity to do so."" The paper also contends that she couldn't be referring to Russia's space tourism program as £2 million is too low for a ride on the Soyuz.That's also more than double the price of space rides that were being offered by Excalibur Almaz, a commercial aerospace company based on the Isle of Man, so that doesn't look like a contender. The most probable culprit is Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic program. Though, according to Space.com, Branson wrote that Rowling was offered the trip ""by parties unknown...which she understandably turned down.""Despite the rumor that Virgin Galactic itself offered the ride, the website reports that Branson was sticker shocked by the £2 million price tag -- SpaceShip Two tickets are going for a comparatively paltry $200,000.If Rowling does decide to change her mind, Branson announced this summer that the first space flight will take place in 2013. So far celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher, Tom Hanks, Katy Perry, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Stephen Hawking are slated to head out of orbit. That is, of course, if SpaceShip Two doesn't continue to ""drop like a rock"" like it did during preliminary testing."

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5e67240000300094a5cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"* Notable jump in whistleblower calls to lawyers* Information, documentation better than beforeBy Nanette ByrnesOct 3 (Reuters) - Whistleblower Bradley Birkenfeld, whose $104 million reward from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service set a record three weeks ago, has helped set off a rush of would-be imitators hoping to cash in on a government program to catch tax cheats.Birkenfeld, now living in New Hampshire, helped lead the IRS to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. taxes owed on money stashed in Swiss bank UBS AG, where he once worked.Dean Zerbe, a partner at Zerbe, Fingeret, Frank & Jadav and one of Birkenfeld's lawyers, estimated he has added at least 15 cases to his roster and lawyers at rival firms reported that they too have seen a notable uptick.""It's been a watershed moment for whistleblowing,"" said Jordan Thomas, chairman of Labaton Sucharow's whistleblower representation practice, which has also seen an increase in inquiries.Although some of the calls are long shots, for the most part ""the quality of the people is significantly better, with better inside information, better documentation and better documents"" than was typical before Birkenfeld, Zerbe said.Despite the case, the IRS program, which was overhauled in 2006, has been criticized for moving too slowly. In June, the agency issued a memo to its staff putting deadlines on processing whistleblower claims.Confidentiality laws keep information about IRS payouts minimal. The agency has said it paid two rewards last year and was on track to pay another three to five this year, including Birkenfeld's.According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, as of last April, a total of 1,387 whistleblowers had identified 9,540 taxpayers since the overhaul was enacted.Birkenfeld chose to disclose his award on Sept. 11, waiving his right to confidentiality. GRASSLEY URGES SWIFT ACTIONBut Republican Senator Charles Grassley said the IRS will have to move quickly if the Birkenfeld publicity results in more leads.""Otherwise, the momentum from the IRS's new policy and procedures and Mr. Birkenfeld's award will be lost, to taxpayers' detriment,"" Grassley told Reuters by email.Grassley, who led the 2006 legislative overhaul, has been a frequent critic of the program's slow progress.Whistleblowers have a growing number of options beyond the IRS. In the past few years, the Federal False Claims Act has been updated and state-level tax and false claim programs in New York and elsewhere have been changed or created, said lawyer Neil Getnick, of Getnick & Getnick LLP.A new whistleblower program at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has just finished its first year and the first reward of $50,000 has been given to an anonymous tipster. That is 30 percent of what the SEC has collected in the case so far and will rise as more is collected. A court already has awarded $1 million in sanctions in the case and judgments might yet come against other defendants, the SEC said.Working against whistleblowers are the long odds of a huge payout, the years most cases take to resolve and the personal turmoil and struggle to find new employment that any informant might face.Some whistleblowers also face prosecution for their role in any tax evasion. Birkenfeld was himself released in August after 30 months in jail for his role helping taxpayers evade taxes.Financially, ""Birkenfeld hit a home run. Meanwhile, many whistleblowers face enormous dangers,"" cautioned New York lawyer Fred Abrams.In a case that shook Swiss banking to its core, UBS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in 2009 and paid $780 million in fines, penalties, interest and restitution to settle charges that it helped thousands of wealthy Americans hide billions of dollars in secret Swiss accounts.Birkenfeld's jail time has proved quite remunerative. Based on netting roughly $44 million after paying federal taxes and legal fees - which lawyers not involved in the case called a reasonable estimate - he realized about $46,000 for each day he spent in prison.U.S. authorities are still investigating other Swiss banks."
6,MONEY,How to Stem the Tide of Junk Mail,"Jason Alderman, Contributor

(AP Photo/Seth Perlman, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5e132100003300c51877.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here's more than you ever wanted to know about junk mail: Each year, according to Catalog Choice, direct mail creates 10 billion pounds of solid waste in the U.S. alone and costs local communities more than $1 billion in collection and disposal expenses -- not to mention putting you at greater risk for identity theft if you don't shred personalized mailings before tossing.So how can you stop the flood of junk mail you receive? You could try moving or changing your name, but as you've probably noticed, a lot of what's delivered to your mailbox is addressed to ""Occupant."" In fact, the U.S. Postal Service relies heavily on such deliveries, which now outnumber first-class postage mailings.Here are a few more practical suggestions for stemming the tide:A good way to significantly reduce the number of offers you get for new credit accounts and insurance is to register with OptOutPrescreen.com, a secure website created by the leading credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, Innovis and TransUnion). By completing a simple online form, you can request to be removed from marketing lists the bureaus supply to lenders and insurance companies for use in firm (preapproved) credit or insurance offers. You'll be asked to provide certain personal information, including your name, address, phone number, Social Security number and date of birth. The information you provide will be treated confidentially.The electronic opt-out is valid for five years. If you want to opt out permanently, you must mail the form to the address provided. You can also opt back into such mailings electronically through the website. And, if you prefer, you may opt in or out by phone at 888-567-8688.Although your request will be completed within five days, you may not see an immediate reduction in the number of solicitations because your name may have already been provided to companies that have not yet mailed their offers. You should see a significant drop within a few months; however you still may receive offers from companies that obtain your contact information from other sources besides these four credit bureaus.Another good method to curb the amount of direct mail you receive is to register with DMAchoice.org, a program run by the Direct Marketing Association, the leading trade organization for businesses and non-profit organizations that send direct mail. When you register, your name is put in a ""delete"" file that is sent to DMA's 3,600-plus members to check against their mailing lists. It's important to note that not all marketers belong to DMA, so registering won't stop all such mailings. Also, it won't stop mailings from companies you already do business with or to which you've made a donation in the past. To get off their lists you'll have to contact them directly. Check the company's or charity's website for their privacy policy, which should contain information on how to curtail or opt out of future mailings. Also make note of their policy on sharing your personal and financial information with affiliates and other third parties.You can also register with DMAchoice.org to stop mail from being sent to a deceased individual or if you want to manage mail being sent to a dependent in your care. And, they have an email preference service where you can opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial emails from DMA members for six years.A third opt-out option to explore is Catalog Choice, a free service that helps you submit opt-out requests for catalogs, coupons, credit card offers, phonebooks, circulars and more. Catalog Choice also offers several paid services where they do more of the legwork to get you off third-party mailing databases. With one, MailStop Envelope, you simply send them mailing labels from unwanted mail in a prepaid envelope. They even have a free iPhone app where you take a picture of the unwanted mail and upload it for processing.  For information on how to reduce the number of marketing calls you get, read my previous blog, How to Stop Annoying Telemarketer Calls.One last suggestion: If you've got elderly parents, you might want to screen their mail for an overabundance of direct mail -- especially catalogs and solicitations for money. If they're on a fixed income and susceptible to strong sales pitches, the combination can be devastating to their bank account. You can help them register with the organizations mentioned above.No matter how diligent your efforts to get yourself off unwanted mailing lists, you're probably still going to get some junk mail. But it's good to know there are ways to significantly scale back the amount.This article is intended to provide general information and should not be considered legal, tax or financial advice. It's always a good idea to consult a legal, tax or financial advisor for specific information on how certain laws apply to you and about your individual financial situation."

A waitress follows with bowls of candied yams, okra, butter beans, Brunswick stew and barbeque slaw. I look across at my friend Sam, a former chef who's lived in Durham for 20 years and has taken me to Bullocks Barbeque to experience traditional Southern BBQ.""I thought we were going to have a light lunch -- not an entire pig-out!"" I say.""You're in the South, get over it,"" Sam replies.   I've come to Durham for the Annual Bull Durham Blues Festival, being held at the same ballpark where they filmed Bull Durham, but right now I'm learning about Southern cooking. Bullock returns to the table and plops down a bowl of hushpuppies. ""Save room for dessert,"" he says, ""because I've got banana pudding, peach cobble and chocolate pie.""Besides his wife and children who work here, Tommy treats everyone as family, including me. He slides into the booth next to Sam. ""You know why they call them hushpuppies?"" he asks. ""Because the slaves used to take the leftover cornbread and fry it up to feed to the dogs.""Tommy has been working at this restaurant since his parents opened it 60 years ago; he still puts in 12-hour days and serves at least 30 entrees, all made from scratch. ""If there's something you don't see on the menu, just ask for it,"" Tommy says, ""and I'll make it for you.""Looking at the huge spread laid out on the table, I'm tempted to ask for a treadmill.Somewhere between the Brunswick stew (delicious) and the spare ribs (never had any better), I learn that the expression ""shooting the bull"" comes from Durham, when people stood around talking and spitting out Bull Durham tobacco. The word ""bullpen"" began at Yankee Stadium where a Bull Durham tobacco logo was painted on the wall of the warm-up pen. Barcode readers, Astroturf and the ctrl-alt-delete computer command were all invented in Durham. North America's largest high tech research park is here along with the AAA Durham Bulls. The town has 43 museums and galleries and is a foodie paradise, offering everything from fine dining to gourmet food trucks. For dinner, I choose Durham's trendiest new hotspot where Spanish food meets Southern drawl. At Mateo Bar de Tapas I chow down on squid meatballs, octopus carpaccio and, tonight's special, a 12-inch long curly barbequed pigtail. No kidding. Since the 1930s, Durham has been home to the Piedmont Blues, and such musicians as Bind Boy Fuller, Washboard Sam and Sonny Davis made this upbeat, ragtime-based, finger-picking blues popular. I stand close to the stage at the Blues Festival listening to Wild Magnolias from New Orleans. Three of the band's musicians are dressed as Mardi Gras Indians and throw us miniature plastic tambourines instead of beads. Later, Marcia Ball wails the blues in her Louisiana swamp-rock meets Texas hold-em. We go wild.Much later, I am still wired and lying awake in my sumptuous suite at The King's Daughters Inn. This 1911 residence, formerly a home for single, elderly woman, has been elegantly and lovingly restored by Deanna and Colin Crossman who met as grad students at Duke. They married, bought the dilapidated property and, for their honeymoon, went to a Restoration School in Maine. The Inn is now a deluxe B&B with Southern furniture in rich velvety textiles and sunny rooms overlooking Duke's East Campus, a perfect place for a workout.Early the next morning, I run the through campus to the massive Gothic Duke University Chapel, then to the Sarah P. Duke Gardens with lotus ponds, terraces and even a Japanese Garden. I decide the one-hour run has earned me the right to indulge in a huge breakfast back at the Inn; I try chocolate pancakes, spicy chicken sausage, grits, fruit, homemade scones -- with no guilt! It's easy to see why Durham has been called America's Foodiest Small Town. Ron Graff, owner of LOAF Bakery is a former scientist researcher who chucked it all to bake bread. Every night before leaving the bakery, he starts a raging fire in a custom made oven, then returns at 4 a.m., cleans out the ash and bakes. ""You'd have to be an idiot to do it this way,"" he grins. I sample a fresh hot baguette. Delicious. Obviously the special oven helps. I decide I'll only have one bite of a chocolate croissant, but of course I eat the whole thing. Saturday is farmer's market day in Durham. Stalls brim with beef, cheeses, local produce, bakery items, organic herbs, spices and crafts. A solo musician sits off to the side playing guitar and I drop a dollar in his basket. (I always tip musicians; they earn it.)Next, I buy a Durham T-shirt with a yellow bull from Liberty Arts, a foundation which is also hosting today's Pig Pickin'. Michael E. Waller, sculptor of Durham's famous bronze bull in downtown Durham, slices off a piece of the delicious cooked pig for me to sample, and then I head off for lunch at the Bull City Burger Brewery. In business just over a year, Bull City Burger Brewery has been voted Durham's greenest restaurant. Owner Seth Gross serves only North Carolina antibiotic-free pasture-raised beef with no hormones. ""I'll close the restaurant before I'll serve corn-fed beef,"" says Gross, who also hand-makes his own buns, mustard and mayo. ""I tried making ketchup,"" he says. ""I bought 250 pounds of tomatoes and cooked them down to eight pounds, and it was all was gone the next day, so I don't any more.""On one side of the restaurant behind a glass wall is a stainless steel working brewery which produces up to eight beers on tap at any given time. ""We import our beer from here to here,"" Gross grins, pointing from the brewery to my table.My cheeseburger, which arrives stabbed through with a steak knife and accompanied by a heaping pile of sweet potato fries, is the best I've ever tasted. Even more amazing, the entire lunch costs less than seven bucks. For a moment, I wonder how much this trip is going to cost me in calories. Then I remember Sam saying, ""You're in the South, get over it.""And I do."

In Berlin, sportsmen and sportswomen from all over the world thus had a great get-together on September 30 -- and so did thousands of spectators along the streets.It's about sports, of course. But it's also a big party, with the runners being cheered by fans, families, friends and Berlin visitors. It's hard to imagine how you could escape from this spectacle which occupies the greater part of central Berlin. And indeed, there's no reason why you should -- even if you are not so much into physical exercise. The electrifying atmosphere is steamed up by samba drummers, and later in the afternoon official and spontaneous private celebrations spring up everywhere in the city. Central to the excitement, of course, is the course, with thousands of athletes running through Brandenburg Gate, to name but one of many nice and historic hotspots along the way.It's a feast for the film maker, getting sporty people, a nice urban panorama and friendly crowds at once, while the news gives us all the important facts. Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya won the 39th BMW Berlin-Marathon 2012 in 2:04:15, 40,000 athletes took part, a million spectators came to watch and celebrate and more than 70 live bands delivered the soundtrack.Our latest contribution to our small video series ""Berlin 01:30"" adds to this as it tries to capture the beat of it all.

Even if you spend a lot of time online, you've probably still get letters, receipts and other important pieces of paperwork that are piling up in your office or online.",2012-10-03,Worried couple doing paperwork in their living room,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5bec240000300094a4cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Linda Descano, CFA®, President and CEO, Women & Co. and Managing Director and Head of Digital Partnerships, North America Marketing, CitiWho doesn't want to live an organized life? Virtually nobody, based on my conversations with women from across the country. Yet many people find the prospect of tackling their file cabinets, storage boxes and drawers full of paper daunting -- and put off the task until ""tomorrow.""Joanne Lang, Founder and CEO of AboutOne, an online family organizer, was one of those women. That changed when her son had a life-threatening medical emergency, which you can read about here, while they were on vacation. That experience propelled Joanne not only to organize her paperwork pronto, but to use her expertise in cloud computing to create a tool for organizing household information and making it accessible whenever and wherever needed, 24/7 on a desktop, smartphone or tablet.""There's no doubt that getting organized requires a small upfront investment of time,"" said Joanne during a recent phone interview. ""The whole point of being organized is to relieve stress by bringing your life back under control. Having a system in place will pay for itself several times over in stress relief when you don't have to frantically look for that one important paper you need."" Still not convinced? Here are three more reasons from Joanne for getting and keeping your paperwork organized:1. Save Time An organized record keeping system will enable you to quickly locate important records and other information when they are needed. Your organized records will also enable you to provide needed information to trusted family or friends when you travel or if there is an emergency. 2. Eliminate Clutter It's so easy to get buried under the press of paper, most of which is just not important! All you have to do is ignore incoming paper for a week or two and you're overwhelmed. Even if you spend a lot of time online, you've probably still get letters, receipts and other important pieces of paperwork that are piling up in your office or online. Being able to scan items quickly from your phone means you can find what you need, when you need it, and that is critical.3. Peace of Mind If a fire or flood were to strike, knowing exactly how to access your family's important papers could save you a lot of trouble. Just imagine the time and effort it would take to replace these documents. Having a system or process in place that allows you to quickly gain access to your important documents eliminates a lot of stress. Another good example is organized records enable you to provide important information to new and current health care providers. These records should include instructions for trusted loved ones or friends that can be used if you travel or if there is an emergency. Having this important information organized in a safe place is a step toward greater peace of mind and security for both you and your loved ones.
