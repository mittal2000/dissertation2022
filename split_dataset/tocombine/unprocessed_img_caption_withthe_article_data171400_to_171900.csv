Which is not to say that I don't have your back in the kitchen come next Thursday. If you want to know how gravy can go wrong, check it out here. And if you're looking for a couple of delicious, no-fuss side dishes, here you go! The cranberry confit can even be made ahead.Cranberry, Onion and Apricot Confit: • 2 pounds onions, thinly sliced • 1/3 cup sugar • 1/2 stick unsalted butter • 2 teaspoons garlic, minced • 1/2 cup red wine vinegar • 1/4 cup water • 2 cups cranberries • salt • 1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped (I use the slab apricots from Trader Joe's)Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over moderate heat, add the onions and sugar, stir and cook until the onions are pale golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring. Add the vinegar, water, cranberries, a pinch of salt and cook the mixture, stirring for 10-15 minutes until the cranberries have burst and are soft. Stir in the apricots and cook for one more minute. Serve warm or at room temperature. You can make this ahead as it will keep in the fridge for 2 weeks covered. Brussels Sprouts and Pearl Onions in Horseradish Cream• 1 bag frozen pearl onions thawed (true confessions, I always buy pearl onions frozen, it's such a pain to peel them, but if you want to go the fresh route, blanch and then peel them) • 1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half the long way • 3 tablespoons horseradish (feel free to use more to taste) • 2 teaspoons flour • 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice (you could use nutmeg) • 3/4 cup heavy cream • 3 tablespoons butter • salt and pepper • 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thymeCook the Brussels sprouts until just tender, either in a microwave for 5 minutes or boil them in salted water for about 6 minutes. Drain well and set aside. Combine the horseradish, flour and allspice in a small bowl, mix well and whisk in the cream. Set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the thyme and stir 30 seconds. Add the onions and Brussels sprouts and sauté until heated through, about 4 minutes. Add the horseradish mixture, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cream is reduced to a glaze, coating the vegetables, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and more horseradish if you like. Serve and enjoy. Happy Thanksgiving!"

In the World According to Retail, the holidays are just hours away, and so -- inevitably -- is the high wire act of gift-giving.Gifts are powerful symbols. In every culture, the choice of object and the manner of presentation carries deep significance. Why are mere things, objects -- freighted with such emotional weight? The answer is rooted in biology as well as psychology. The first object every human loves is the breast -- the ultimate comfort object -- in fact, one that is essential for an infant's survival and sense of self. Humans are hard-wired to relate to respond emotionally to objects, to see in them all matter of meaning. During the holiday season, this universal aspect of human culture takes centerstage. That's why holiday shopping, even during a hectic time, requires careful thought--whether it's a business gift or, especially, a personal one. What is the emotional context of the gift? What is the message you want to convey? Ideally, a gift says, ""I know you, and I value you for who you are."" It's especially meaningful, if the gift isn't a shared interest. A gift that recognizes the other person's unique qualities is especially meaningful. There's even an element of self-sacrifice involved, since it has no direct benefit for the giver except seeing pleasure in the eyes of another. For people who love stuff, gifts have obvious appeal. But for some people stuff comes with mixed feelings. Many people are overly attached to their stuff, and piling on more at the holidays is a double-edged sword.When thinking about what to give -- remember it's never just about the object, it's about the meaning. At the holidays and all year round, the best message is this: I see who you are, and know what will make you happy.So, as we rush out to embrace Black Friday, look less at all the merchandise, and more at the person whose heart you want to touch."

Some doomsday theories designate Bugarach peak as a sacred mountain that would be spared on December 21, 2012, when the Maya's Long Count calendar marks the end of a 5,126-year era -- a date some say marks the end of the world. Villagers in Bugarach fear an onslaught of visitors, trying to escape apocalypse.

These extra-terrestrials will then save the locals before zipping off toward some less-destroyed planet. This sort of prediction is somewhat unsurprisingly making the town a desirable destination for people who go in for such things, who -- as it turns out -- aren't terribly popular with the locals.""This is the 183rd end-of-the-world prophecy since antiquity,"" Bugarach Mayor Pierre Delord told The Guardian.

The Mission for the Fight against Sects has been keeping a close eye on Bugarach, according to The Sun, out of concerns surrounding mass suicides and other potential PR disasters.

If you're as busy as we are, you might not even have your menu planned yet. But don't fret! The New York Times has designed a quiz which they've dubbed ""Thanksgiving-erator"" to help you determine what to cook.The quiz allows you to choose from 7 themes: Modernist, Colonialist, Nostalgist, Hedonist, Baconist (!), Extremist and Purist. You then can select a main course, stuffing, side dish, dessert and beverage. The Thanksgiving-erator is as hilarious as it is helpful. The Hedonist theme pokes fun at its own truffle fixation (""I can drink truffles, too?"" is a drink option), and the Nostalgist category jests, ""Anything besides stuff turkey is heresy."" Once you've finally determined your holiday meal persona, the Thanksgiving-erator generates recipes, and voila! You have yourself a dinner plan that promises to be as tasty as it is thematically cohesive. The Modernist theme consists of Butternut Squash Cannoli and Carbonated Cranberries, while the Colonialist option includes Minced Pie of Beef and Plum Pudding and the Baconist menu features, well, bacon.

Black Friday began in earnest as stores opened their doors at midnight. (AP Photo/Rich Addicks)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8363250000330036183b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Emily DoviWith all the Black Friday ad leaks and sneak peeks we've unearthed in the past few weeks, this season's shopping extravaganza is looking ripe with deals and discounts for all. But even though many product categories will see new all-time low prices, not everything will be a good purchase on Black Friday. In some cases, you would be better off skipping certain deals and waiting for a better offer later on in the coming year. Here are 10 items that are not worth buying this Black Friday.Toys We've said it many times already, and we'll say it once more: Black Friday is not the best time to buy toys for the holidays. Many will likely still be discounted for Black Friday, and it may feel pretty good to get your shopping done early, but you won't love that sinking feeling you'll get when you see those toys discounted for less about two weeks before Christmas.  Game Consoles Without a Bundled ItemSpeaking of toys, if you're looking to buy any of the major video game consoles this holiday, you're likely to get more bang for your buck by opting for one that comes with a few extras. While we've already seen a few choice Xbox deals in the leaked Black Friday ads, in years past, the vast majority of Editors' Choice console deals went to holiday bundles that included premium accessories and two or three game titles. These were frequently discounted 30 percent to 40 percent off their retail prices.Brand Name HDTVs Black Friday is an excellent time to invest in a new HDTV, as we predict a variety of size categories will hit their lowest price points. But don't expect the best deals to be tagged with name brands. Typically, the rock-bottom prices will mostly apply to third-tier manufacturers. Instead, brand name TVs tend to see their best price of the year in January and February as manufacturers look to clear stock in preparation for new models in the spring.The Latest Digital Cameras There's no shortage of digital camera deals around Black Friday, but keep in mind that the premium current-generation models are just a few months away from being replaced by a new line of 2013 options. If you're eyeing a brand new digital SLR, we recommend waiting until February or later when it becomes an ""old model,"" resulting in more aggressive discounts from retailers.Christmas Decorations While not typically on anyone's ""To Buy on Black Friday"" list, Christmas decor tends to end up in-cart on impulse buys. Sure, that string of lights or holiday wreath might be on sale, but deals on Christmas items get better the closer we get to the holiday itself -- and of course are the best after the holiday.Office Supplies For some, it may seem silly to advise against office supply deals on Black Friday, as it's not typically a category associated with the shopping event. But for several years running, office supply stores like Office Depot and OfficeMax have released Black Friday ads in the hopes of encouraging an uptick in business. Unfortunately, these deals are generally no better than those we see throughout the rest of the year. In fact, during the entire Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday stretch in 2011, we only found a measly three Editors' Choice deals in this category.Jewelry and Watches We're flagging this accessories category ""Do Not Buy"" for the entire holiday season. Much like Christmas items, there will be lots of sales advertising shiny, metallic objects perfect for him or her. But the discounts on jewelry around the winter holidays are no better than those around Valentine's Day, when baubles are at their most in-demand. And instead of buying a watch now, consider holding off until the spring and summer when we see more Editors' Choice deals.Winter Apparel During Black Friday, we'll likely see some of the best apparel coupons of the year from a variety of retailers. However, if winter apparel is on your list, it's smarter to hold off until January, when those items are added to clearance sales that take much deeper base discounts. We will inevitably find additional stacking coupons then too, to make those stronger sales even better for your wallet.Apple iPad mini The long-awaited iPad mini will set you back at least $329, and if it follows the price pattern of its distant predecessor, the first generation iPad, it won't see a discount until several months from now. While there's an off-chance that an attention-seeking retailer could offer an iPad mini promotion (the latest full-size iPad is included in the Target Black Friday ad, after all), the bottom line is this: The iPad mini features essentially the same innards as the iPad 2, and we're predicting that the latter will fall to $299 this Black Friday. Therefore, the iPad 2 will offer more screen real estate at a lower price.Microsoft Surface RT Tablet Microsoft has seemingly made a concerted effort to position its products in line with Apple's, thus exerting a considerable amount of control over where the Surface is available and for how much. And like Apple's tendency to offer minimal discounts on the iPad, Microsoft might only offer a marginal deal on the Surface this season. But if Surface sales are weak, the tablet may instead go the way of the BlackBerry PlayBook, wherein we'll see its price fall considerably by the spring.This post first appeared on dealnews.
