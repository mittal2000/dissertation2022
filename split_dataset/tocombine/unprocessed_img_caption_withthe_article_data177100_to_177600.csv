When completed, Sands will have more than 9,000 hotel rooms, which it says will help drive business.The total cost of Sands Cotai Central is expected to be $5 billion upon completion, more than twice the cost of Galaxy Entertainment's Galaxy Macau, which opened last year.Adelson, worth an estimated $25 billion by Forbes, has one more land site left to develop in Macau and is expected to start construction on the site, known as parcel 3, in November. It will be designed as a replica of the Eiffel Tower and is expected to take between 24 and 44 months to build. The phase will cost Adelson $2.5 billion.Michael Leven, chief operating officer for Las Vegas Sands, said $1 billion of the financing will come from the company's equity base with the remainder coming from international banks.The Macau government recently granted Sands an extension until 2015 to complete construction on parcel 3.

In naming Chimney Rock a monument, Obama was following in the footstep of Theodore Roosevelt, who became concerned about a rocky spire sticking out of the Black Hills in 1906. Using the new Antiquities Act, the Roosevelt declared Devil's Tower to be a National Monument and, in so doing, created a new type of American park.National Monuments have always been a motley group of unexpected landscapes, especially because they are created by presidents without the approval of Congress and because of their diversity (the Statue of Liberty is a huge commitment, others, not so much.). These protected areas run the gamut from Wile E. Coyote desert to sea forts to caves and mountains, but they all have caught the eye of executives who couldn't help but preserve them so that another generation of Americans could visit them and think, ""What the hell?""The strangest of America's National Monuments serve as a reminder that the diversity of this vast country is not merely demographic and geographic, it is also ecological and geological. Moonscapes dot Idaho and the bottom of the Pacific Ocean is filled with sharks that owe their safety to President Bush."

She has been in the hospital for 11 days already, eight of which were spent undergoing chemotherapy that is necessary to prepare for the transplant, People magazine reported.Robin Roberts wrote in a tweet yesterday:Myelodysplastic syndrome, formerly known as preleukemia, is a condition where the bone marrow does not produce enough healthy blood cells, according to the National Cancer Institute. Common treatments include medication and bone marrow transplant, like the one Roberts will undergo. With a bone marrow transplant, the patient first undergoes chemotherapy so that the body's defective blood cells are destroyed, according to the Mayo Clinic. Then, those cells are replaced by either a person's own stem cells (called an autologous transplant), or a donor's, which is called an allogeneic transplant. In Roberts's case, she is receiving bone marrow stem cells from her sister, who was found to be a match. The National Institutes of Health reported that the actual transplantation usually does not require surgery; the donor's stem cells are delivered to the patient's body via a central venous catheter. Then, those cells go to the bone marrow, which is the sponge-like tissue in bone. The patient's blood cell count will begin to rise when these donated cells start to grow and go on to produce new blood cells, according to the National Marrow Donor Program. But until the immune system gets to full strength again, the patient must be watched carefully by doctors for the 100 days following the transplant because of complication risk, the National Marrow Donor Program reported. That's because post-transplant, the immune system is still weak and infections may occur. Other possible complications include acute graft-versus-host disease, which is when the donated cells attack the body, and graft failure, which is when the donated cells are rejected by the body. People can become marrow donors by registering with the Be the Match Registry. According to the most recent registry data, transplants that were conducted via donors from this registry increased between 2005 and 2010, from 2,600 to 5,200. In 2010, 15 percent of these transplants from donors were conducted in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, according to the registry data. Want to sign up to be a bone marrow donor?

The FDA said that it defines sugar as a solid, dried and crystallized food ￂﾗ not a syrup. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c3fd33c0000320009b062.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of food companies has filed a lawsuit against the Sugar Association, a trade group representing the sugar industry, for making false claims in advertising that allegedly caused loss of profit and other damages. Their action comes on the heels of an earlier complaint issued by the sugar industry against makers and users of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) for saying that their product was essentially identical to sugar and should be marketed as such. Last year, the Corn Refiners Association (CRA) had asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the name HFCS to ""corn sugar,"" a request that was ultimately rejected. HFCS is derived from corn and is cheaper to produce than natural sugar made from sugarbeets and sugarcane. Both are present in countless foods and beverages Americans consume every day, and some experts believe there is a strong connection between these sweeteners and the current obesity crisis. In fact, studies have linked the consumption of large amounts of added sweeteners to widespread illnesses, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease and dental problems. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends an upper limit of 100 calories for women (about 6 teaspoons) and 150 calories for men (about 9 teaspoons) from added sugar per day. That high sugar consumption, whatever the source may be, can be detrimental to people's health is not disputed, not even by the respective industries. In a public statement referring to the lawsuit, the CRA says that ""vilifying one kind of added sugar [in this case, HFCS] will not reduce American's waistlines. Reducing all added sugars and reducing calorie intake in general will."" The real issue is, the statement continues, that ""Americans should reduce their consumption of all added sugars and calories in general.""Considering that sweeteners in all forms are added to so many food products, including those that don't necessarily taste sweet, it is hard to see how consumers could control their intake on their own. The question is not whether sweeteners are ""nutritionally equivalent"" and ""indistinguishable once they are absorbed in the blood stream,"" as the CRA statement claims, but how consumers can be protected from potential harm to their health and be helped to make better choices. Whether it's HFCS or added sugar, the fact that they are almost ubiquitous ingredients in our highly-processed food and drink supply leaves consumers without much chance to improve their diet. And besides, are we really to believe that food manufacturers whose profitability depends on ever-increasing sales are serious about encouraging the public to buy fewer of their products? If that was the case, why do they keep spending billions of dollars in advertising, including to children? What's at stake here is consumer spending, not health concerns. The damages that are being claimed are price erosion and lost profits -- not damages done to people's nutritional and physical well-being from products that may be associated with some of the most widespread health problems we are confronted with today.Food and Health with Timi Gustafson, R.D.For more by Timi Gustafson, R.D., click here.For more health news, click here."
6,WELLNESS,"The Today Show's Joy Bauer Proves Yet Again That Anyone (Yes, Anyone!) Can Lose Weight","Gregg McBride, Contributor

She let me know she was appearing on Access Hollywood Live the next day and wanted to know if I was up for hanging out in the ""green room"" (aka backstage) with her. Of course, my answer was a very quick ""Yes."" Little did I know that Joy planned to pull me on the air.The next morning I woke up to a slew of emails from the Access Hollywood Live producers, letting me know where to be and when to be there. It was an early call here on the West Coast because the show shoots ""live"" for the East Coast feed. But the producers didn't have to ask me twice. I picked out what I hoped was a dapper outfit and rushed over to the studio.Spending time with Joy is always, well, a joy. And the pun is intended. She is such a big ball of energy and usually has a crowd of people hanging around her (many of whom are people who work behind the scenes) -- all because she is so happy, so full of inspiration and also has a wicked sense of humor.Joy was appearing on the show to promote her New York Times best-selling book The Joy Fit Club (yeah, the one with yours truly along with a few others featured on the cover). The book has been a big hit, and Joy was sharing some of the secrets of her Joy Fit Club members so that people watching would realize if her Joy Fit Club members could lose weight without surgery or fad diets, so could they.I was slated to walk out at the end of the segment, and that I did -- in the goofiest way possible. In fact, when co-host Billy Bush asked me to start dancing, I didn't think twice -- I went for it. Those of you who know me or who regularly follow my blogs on The Huffington Post might have surmised that I'm a ham at heart (and you'd be right).But along with getting a kick out of hearing from friends who happen to see me on TV, I love being able to help Joy get the message out that anyone, no matter how much they weigh, how many diets they've tried or how long they've been overweight, can lose their excess weight and keep it off. Having lost more than 250 pounds of excess weight myself (after topping out at more than 450 pounds) and having kept it off for more than a decade, I'm living proof of that. And I want everyone to know they can do it as well. They have what it takes. You have what it takes. And that journey to dieting success can begin today.While appearing on air, Joy shared some great tips from members of her Joy Fit Club, including one from Kim DeMundo (who has lost and kept off 110 pounds). Kim uses a ""Bag of Tricks"" to avoid cheating (she keeps several pieces of paper inside the bag, each listing something to do other than cheat on her diet -- simple activities that are all geared to take her mind off of food). Great idea, right? And one we can easily incorporate ourselves.Another Joy Fit Club member, April Hudson (who has lost and kept off 109 pounds), uses creative additions to make her salads more enticing. These additions include using a tablespoon or two of pine nuts or raw cashews, adding fresh sliced fruit or avocado and also using flavored vinegars (ones that are so tasty that no oil is required on the salad).The show segment ended up running a little long, so I came out after the last commercial break -- and appeared during the end credits of the show. This is especially hilarious because the producers ""squeezed"" the picture (so it's visually thinner) in order to accommodate the credits appearing on the right hand side of the screen (as you can see in the clip below). Thus, I look especially thin (when dancing like a goofball).If only we could all be squeezed (visually) like this in daily life. Then we wouldn't have to worry about losing weight and fitting into our skinny jeans. Then again, with inspirations like Joy Bauer getting the word out that anyone can achieve dieting success, we can leave all of the squeezing (including into clothes and other tight spaces) behind us once and for all.For more by Gregg McBride, click here.For more on weight loss, click here."

For the first time in 15 years, the United States Department of Agriculture is implementing an overhaul to school lunch guidelines. New nutrition standards set calorie limits based on grade level, reduce sodium levels, ban trans fats, allow only non-fat and low-fat milk, require fruits and vegetables are both offered daily, and substantially increase whole grains. These and other changes are part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. I applaud the federal government for taking this important step that allows schools to create and reinforce healthy eating habits. Texas has the fifth-highest rate of child food insecurity in the country, and meals served through the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program may be the only food these children receive all day. A school lunch of pizza sticks, a banana, raisins and whole milk under the old guidelines will now be whole wheat spaghetti with meat sauce, a whole wheat roll, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, kiwi and low-fat milk. This change will help more than 2.4 million Texas students who receive a free or reduced-price school lunch lead healthier, more active lives -- in and out of the classroom.Similar changes will be required for the School Breakfast Program beginning in the fall of 2013. However, only 56 percent of children who receive free and reduced-price lunch in Texas also participate in the breakfast program. While breakfast is the most important meal of the day, stigma and transportation barriers often keep eligible students from eating a free breakfast at school. The Texas Hunger Initiative -- a statewide anti-hunger organization within the Baylor University School of Social Work -- is working with school districts across the state to increase participation in child nutrition assistance programs, such as the School Breakfast Program. The increased use of innovative breakfast delivery models, including Breakfast in the Classroom and Grab and Go Breakfast, provide convenience to students who no longer need to arrive early and help reduce the stigma associated with school breakfast. Through our partnership with Share Our Strength -- the nation's largest child anti-hunger organization -- we launched the Texas No Kid Hungry campaign last school year and continue our work to ensure that Texas children have consistent access to nutritious meals that will allow them to be successful in life.We are also beginning to work with school districts statewide to help implement the new school lunch nutrition standards and will do the same next school year when the new school breakfast guidelines go into effect. If you have children that eat school lunch, encourage them to try the fruits, vegetables and other new offerings served this year. If your children don't currently eat school lunch, have them give it a try, and I bet they will be pleasantly surprised -- and so will you.For more by Jeremy Everett, click here.For more health news, click here "
