While it's not exactly a new concept that husbands buy their wives postnatal gifts, it is becoming more and more expected that the gift will entail expensive jewelry. Why? Well, there are at least three factors, the first two of which are probably just two sides of the same coin. First, the rich and famous do it, and do they ever. Mariah Carey received a $12,000 diamond and pink sapphire necklace with her twins' names after delivering. And after Beyoncé gave birth to Blue Ivy Carter, Jay-Z presented her with an appropriately-colored 8-10 carat blue tanzanite ring, estimated at $35,000. The second reason, which really stems from the first or at least exacerbates it, is that we live in a consumer culture. Keeping-up-with-the-joneses can ""push"" men with peer pressure, familial pressure or just societal pressure to maintain appearances in the rat-race of who wore/bought what. I call this the ""culture of acquiring stuff.""Finally, the third reason is that men in the twenty-first century are possibly more aware and sympathetic to what their wives endure during pregnancy and delivery. This may be due to their participation in childbirth classes or in the delivery room. As Dr. Philippe Girerd, an obstetrician in Richmond, Va., explained in a New York Times article: ""I think husbands are more involved with the prenatal process. Women go through back pain, morning sickness, stress and so on. We just sit around and take the credit. I think a lot of 21st century husbands are a little more in touch with that."" In light of gifting his wife with a ring and a watch after giving birth to their children, he commented, ""I could care less about the jewelry industry. For me, it was acknowledging everything my wife had been through.And if that's the thought behind giving your wife a push present, then I wholeheartedly support that. Acknowledging a wife's hard work and suffering to grow a baby is a commendable gesture. But, the gift must be both appropriate and affordable.That the gift should be appropriate seems obvious, but this point is crucial. Hubbies need to know their wives' tastes and personalities well enough to make this call. If a woman is the practical type and likes gifts that are both useful and thoughtful, consider buying her what she would truly appreciate when the baby is born, like a massage, cleaning help, babysitting help, or a new, comfortable, machine-washable, non-maternity outfit. If, on the other hand, we're talking about a wife who thoroughly enjoys accessories and expects her husband to buy her jewelry, then her husband has a lot less flexibility. Maybe he should consider a charm necklace or bracelet with the baby's name and/or birth date, which he can add to with each subsequent child's birth. How about a customized ring with the baby's finger print? Or a locket in his wife's favorite color with a special message or picture inside.In addition to being appropriate, the present must also be affordable, which takes on a whole new meaning in light of the cost of having and raising a kid. As if it weren't already enough to budget for all the expensive baby gear and childcare costs, now hubby is expected to save for a diamond bracelet too? As a father of six, I can tell you that your child-rearing expenses will always surprise you on the upside. Why spend money now on expensive jewelry that you'll wish you had foregone in order to save for any number of these real expenses in the not-so-distant future?As I've said before, don't be fooled by the diamond's industry's clever marketing to make you think that diamonds are forever and are the only gemstones that can represent love and romance. Diamonds are beautiful, yes, but so is your wife's smile when you present her with a less expensive alternative that will still communicate your gratitude and appreciation for her super-heroic entry into motherhood.So, take a look at your intentions in buying a push present. Are you trying to keep up with the neighbors? Have you been pushed into this purchase? Want to mimic Hollywood actors who have loads of cash that you don't? If the answer is yes to any of these, you have some soul-searching to do. But if you genuinely want to recognize, thank, and celebrate your wife's hard work to grow and birth a baby, then a push present is a beautiful way to accomplish that. Just keep it appropriate and affordable, and you will both feel happier and less stressed when the big day arrives and junior joins the family tree."

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdfcf2100003100c54cbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Toni ClarkeWASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration kicked off a series of public meetings on Thursday to explain its proposed new rules for improving the safety of the nation's food supply - and gain feedback on the potential regulations.The rules offer a framework for implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act, which was signed into law in January 2011. The law represents the most sweeping reform of food safety laws in more than 70 years.More than 3,000 people in the United States die each year from food-borne illnesses, according to federal data. One in six are sickened and 100,000 hospitalized from illnes tied to such pathogens as salmonella, E. Coli and listeria.The new law is designed to move the FDA into preventive mode from the reactive mode in which it has operated historically, swooping in only after an outbreak has occurred. It gives the agency increased powers to inspect facilities and enforce compliance with safety standards.Yet it remains an open question whether the FDA will be able to invest in the staff, training or technology it needs to implement the rules it has spent two years crafting.President Barack Obama's 2013 budget included an increase in the FDA's funding of $225 million to implement the new law, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, Michael Taylor, said in an interview.The funds were to come from fees charged to food facilities, importers and exporters. That budget has not been authorized by Congress.Even if the funds were to be authorized, they would not be enough to fully implement the regulations, Taylor said.He declined to give an exact cost estimate, saying that would be presented in an upcoming report to Congress, but he said it would likely be less than the $583 million figure projected by the Congressional Budget Office.""We think we can implement the law, with caveats, for less than that,"" he said, ""but $225 million wouldn't cover it.""Under the new law, the FDA for the first time will be allowed to penalize U.S. companies that fail to monitor produce they import from abroad, an extra layer of food safety protection for inspectors whose resources are stretched thin.""Right now at the border, we're limited in the percentage of food and medical devices we can inspect,"" said Michael Roberts, a consumer safety officer at the FDA, who spoke in an interview at a conference for the National Treasury Employees Union.The FDA's budget will be even tighter if the automatic budget cuts known as ""sequestration"" begin on March 1. Those cuts would cut into the travel budget needed for investigators to carry out inspections around the country and the world.""It's already created a slowdown in operations because you can't predict what will happen,"" Roberts said.In January, the FDA released two of five proposed new rules. It discussed the first of those rules, governing agricultural produce, on Thursday. The FDA is set to discuss its proposal for ensuring safety at human food facilities on Friday. Later this year, it will release three additional proposals.The new regulations lay out a myriad of standards, some less stringent than others, depending on the assessed risk of a particular product or facility. For example, products that are eaten raw are considered to carry a greater risk of contamination than those destined for a food processor.Recent outbreaks of food-borne illness have been linked to lettuce, spinach, cantaloupe and peanuts, among other foods.

AFP PHOTO PHILIPPE HUGUEN (Photo credit should read PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdfd92100003000c54cc4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lately, there has been quite bit of conversation revolving around the humane treatment of animals as it relates to my industry. And now, horses have found their way into this discussion.  ""Who wants to eat such a handsome, intelligent animal as a horse? I mean, horses are the smartest animal.""Well, actually -- and here's where one of those pesky scientific facts some people choose to avoid comes in -- pigs are more intelligent than horses. That's how pigs and boars thrive so well in the wild. They also have great personalities, and can understand fear and pain. But we can't ride a pig. Our kids can't hop on a pig and ride them like they can a pony. We can't pump them full of steroids until their bones can't even hold up their muscles and watch them run around a track really fast. We can't train them to hop over hurdles, and run after little calves that we'll rope up and then throw our hands in the air like we've done something monumental. Hell, we can't even attach a carriage to them and ride them through the streets of Philadelphia. They're just a dirty, rolling in the mud, dumb old pig ... clearly not as important as the horse.  It sounds to me like the Hollywood of animal selection. Tall, thin and beautiful people are fawned over like they walk on water, but if you're fat and homely, stay away, it's just not gonna happen for you -- you're not special enough. It seems to me that the animals we deem to be stronger, more regal, and frankly, cuter, get preferential treatment in our society. Sounds like discrimination to me, and I'm not sure who gets to be arbiter of what's good and what's bad, and what's allowed and what's not.Unfortunately, these are very small indicators of a much bigger, more global problem. It seems that while everyone is talking about being humane to animals, they are forgetting a very crucial and basic principal of ethics in society today. What about being humane to humans? I respect the choice of every one of our restaurants' guests, and potential guests, to choose what they will and will not eat. Why is it ok for them to disrespectfully disagree with me even if I am conforming to law and to self-imposed high-quality standards? It's because we encourage debate and discourse, not threats and fear-mongering. I see occasional picketing outside zoos, and alongside the horse carriages in historic Philadelphia, however, it never seems to gain traction. Now, the mere mention of a chef possibly serving horse tartare or horse filet with Roquefort wrapped in bacon -- double whammy -- or even foie gras, has them coming out in droves with a vengeance threatening to shut it all down, picketing relentlessly, and of course, there's always the pleasant threat of ""Watch your back, Cheffy,"" with a video shot through your window of you playing with your two-year-old son in your own home. Never mind that as Americans especially, we tend to judge others by our own values, all the while ignoring the distinct cultural customs and norms that exist outside of our society.Separately, I find this vitriol directed toward farmers and chefs to be a bit odd. In the course of worrying and fighting about what's happening to these animals, we've forgotten about what's happening to our own children. Why aren't we picketing and fighting with the same vigor for their well-being and health? It's the ultimate hypocrisy. In this country, obesity is at epidemic proportions, and showing no signs of slowing. We feed our children junk like high fructose corn syrup, and animal products artificially injected with hormones, additives and preservatives. Now, that's if we even feed them at all. Seventeen million American children are food insecure. The fact of the matter is if we worried about our children as much as we worried about horses and ducks, we would be able to annihilate many of these issues.  The fact is that chefs strive to be true champions and students of ecology, sustainability, the environment and the humane treatment of animals. We care. A lot. Do you really think any self-respecting chef, who remains at the forefront of sustainability would serve anything that was less than the best possible product? Is there a chance that any of us would threaten our own integrity by doing so? We visit with all the farmers who provide us our produce and raise our livestock. We watch their process. At any turn if there was ever a corner cut, we'd know it, product would suffer and we wouldn't be keen to serve it. We're vehemently opposed to the disrespect and disregard of animals that happens daily in conventional agriculture and mass producing slaughterhouses. As chefs, it's our duty to involve ourselves in the entire process. I have watched calves being born, fed them, nurtured them and assisted in a humane slaughter. An animal's life is never something to take for granted, and never something to become complacent about. Experiencing this gives you a connection and a sensitivity that many people go without.  In his 1980 book, About Looking, John Berger, wrote: ""A peasant becomes fond of his pig, and is glad to salt away its pork."" What is significant, and is so difficult for the urban stranger to understand, is that the two statements in that sentence are connected by an and, and not by a but.It's a statement to think about whether you eat meat or not. It is also probably one of the most profound dichotomies that there ever was. Yet, at the same time it's healthy to have the discussion. We should never become complacent about eating meat, and always remember where it came from. It gives the life of the animal purpose, and a life with purpose is really what we are all seeking. Funny thing, I never had any intentions of putting horse on my menu just for the sake of it. If I were to find a livestock farmer who was raising them humanely, I would consider it. But until then, I'll keep investigating all sides of the matter, unlike the people calling for my colleagues' and my heads on a platter. Horses are beautiful loving, intelligent animals. And so are pigs, cows, lambs, goats, deer and all of the others. Yet, they can also be sources of food, and an important part of the natural food chain of ecology. I'm happy to discuss this with anyone who disagrees -- or agrees -- with me, provided you give me the same respect you believe should be accorded to the animals. It's the humane thing to do."

Sure, I spend hours every weekend watching HGTV with my mom and daughter, but I always felt that I lacked the vision to pluck some hidden treasure from a thrift store, Craigslist, or flea market and turn it into something amazing. Well, recently an opportunity arose that challenged me to do just that.With only $100 to spend, I was tasked with finding a thrift store treasure and rehabbing it into an item that someone would actually bid for at an auction. After a number of fruitless stops, I finally found a nice, wooden side table with curved legs, novel contours on the tabletop and a scallop shell carved into both sides. It cost me $35.For weeks I debated what I'd do with it to make an impact and then a crafty co-worker introduced me to marble paper. My idea was born. Playing up the shell accent on the table, I opted for a swirling, marine blue and white marble paper. Two sheets (just in case I messed up one) came to $16 and it was another $7.95 for the Mod Podge (something I'd never heard of before, but came highly recommended by the sales associate for my project). I already had a can of satin finish and white spray paint at home, from a project I did with my daughter a little while back. So I took to my garage and went to work.The drab-to-fab process:First, I wiped down the table with a soft, dry cloth to remove any excess dirt or dust. I didn't use a paper towel to avoid trace amounts of paper fibers being left behind. I laid a sheet of marble paper over the top of the table to judge which sections would be left exposed. Luckily, the width was just enough to cover it all -- the length was no problem.Next, I started spraying the legs of the table. As I moved around to each side of the table, I noticed that I was starting to leave white footprints on the garage floor, and eventually got a clue to lay out paper on the floor. I transferred the table onto the newspaper and continued the painting process. Two coats gave it a nice, crisp finish.After all of the legs and sides were painted, I carefully sprayed the areas of the table that would not be covered by the paper. I let the table dry for the afternoon and later came back to apply a thin layer of Mod Podge. It's necessary to emphasize that a thin layer is required, because even though Mod Podge dries clear, if you use too much of it, it'll soak through your paper, leaving slight discoloration.After a few deep-meditation breaths, I carefully laid the marble paper onto the table, gently smoothing any loose areas and air from the surface. I left it to dry overnight.The following day, after more deep-meditation breaths, I used a craft knife to carefully cut away the overhang from the contours of the table top. This was a nerve-wracking process, and it pays to go slowly.With a final, deep exhale, the cutting was finished and the table was stunning. It went from looking like something from Grandma's house to a posh, little piece that would be at home in any chic setting.I sealed the table with two thin layers of Mod Podge that I let dry for a few hours in between coats. For an added layer of protection, I used a thin layer of acrylic spray coating, which I let dry overnight.You can vote for my side table in the Ultimate Upcycle Challenge for the Great Big Texas Home Show.

T. Bone Burnett's music soars, adding to the grandeur. But this is all a trope, setting the viewer up for a ""take down,"" where we are built up only to fall all the harder.And not without good reason, for 50 million Americans, children, adults and the elderly, are now hungry, uncertain about having food to carry them through the day or the week ahead. Presidents as divergent in their politics as Reagan, Bush I and II, Clinton and Obama have foresworn to end hunger, yet each has presided over an unceasing rise in hunger, with five times as many Americans today going hungry as there were in the 1970s. Upon descending from up on high, A Place at the Table enters the grinding lives of: Rosie (a fifth grader) and her teacher Leslie Nichols (who in childhood also knew hunger), from Collbran, Colo., where small town life nestled beneath the awesome Rockies is rife with unemployment, unlivable wages, and hunger; Barbie, a 20-year-old single mother of two in Philadelphia, whose young son is already experiencing the developmental delays that disproportionately strike nutritionally-compromised children living in urban chaos and poverty; Tremonica, a second grader already obese and unhealthy, whose family lives in Jonestown, Miss., a state that gets the prize for ranking at the bottom of all 50 in food insecurity (a term referring to being uncertain about having or obtaining enough food to meet the needs of a household). The documentary examines unblinkingly a full-time town police officer who has to go to food pantries to feed his family, a rancher who works nights as a school janitor to put food on the table, and a cook in rural Mississippi who must drive 45 minutes to find a green grocer (and spends more than $10 in gas).The ironies abound in this lean 84-minute documentary. Obesity in this country is shown to be often a sign of hunger and poverty, unlike in very poor, developing countries, where hunger and poverty leave people all skin and bones. Becoming employed, as did Barbie after a year of trying, left her unable to feed her family because she earned less than a living wage -- though she no longer qualified for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (food stamps). Seventy percent percent of federal agricultural subsidies go to 10 percent of U.S. farmers -- not the family farms that gave rise to this support in the crippling depression of the 1930s, but to the corporate agribusinesses that dominate farming today. These subsidies sustain the massive production of corn, wheat and soy used to make affordable (cheap) processed foods, such as chips, cookies and cakes, candies, and high-starch (and salted) foods like bread and many pastas. Since the early 1980s, the costs of processed foods have dropped by 40 percent while the costs of fruits and vegetables have increased 40 percent. Even if poor families were to try to buy healthier foods, they frequently live in ""food deserts,"" vast swatches of rural and (even more so) urban communities, where stores shelves burst with processed foods and not an apple or head of lettuce is to be seen.The consequences of hunger are far greater than the pain and malaise that comes with an empty stomach. A hungry child cannot pay attention in school. Nutritional deficiencies in a mother carrying a child and in the early years of life produce delays in brain development, leading to impairments in learning and behavioral disorders and to children being left behind. One in three children entering their teens today will develop Type 2 diabetes. Obesity, in time, increases the risk of hypertension, heart disease and stroke, and puts more strain on our joints leading to osteoarthritis and mobility problems. A Place At The Table is another socially-focused film by Participant Media, which has produced documentaries such as An Inconvenient Truth, Food, Inc. and Waiting for Superman, as well as fictional stories, including Contagion and The Help, with unsparingly-honest views on contemporary issues.The message in this documentary is that hunger in this country is not about lack of a sufficient food supply -- we have ample stores of grain. Hunger is about the denial of adequate and nutritious food to families living in poverty, whether on our great plains or occupying our inner cities. We witness the evidence in the film's stories of these families, from spokespeople like Congressman James McGovern (U.S. Representative, Massachusetts and co-chair, Congressional Hunger Center) to actor Jeff Bridges (founder of End Hunger Network), and from experts and doctors who have documented hunger in America and treated its consequences (see some examples below).I left the theater feeling empty, not really hungry. But I went home and made myself a salad of pricey Whole Foods greens with virgin olive oil and some low-fat nuts. I have the good fortune of living in an oasis of healthy food abundance and an income to purchase nutritious food to help keep healthy. There will be those who criticize this film for promoting government programs or encouraging dependency among people living in poverty in this country. I suspect these critics will not have experienced uncertainty about where their next meal will come from or how ""hunger messes with you,"" in the words of one young girl in A Place At The Table.

You should have -- last Saturday was National Banana Bread Day! Who knew? And thanks to banana bread, there's no need for overripe bananas to go to waste.But here's an important tip -- bananas are not the only food that can be used past their prime. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, 40 percent of food in the U.S. goes uneaten. That's like throwing $165 billion into a landfill each year.Here are some creative ways to use food that's expired, too ripe or past its prime.Produce is the most wasted category of food. Keep a sealed bag in the freezer and when vegetables or herbs start to wilt, toss them in to make a vegetable stock with later. You can also throw in trimmings from carrots, celery, even corncobs.Overripe fruit is the perfect candidate for jam and it's simple to make. Basically, all you're doing is boiling down fruit with sugar and lemon juice. Even unprocessed jam (skipping the boiling water bath) will last about a month in the refrigerator.Grind stale bread in a food processor to make breadcrumbs, which have endless uses -- coat fish filets before frying, bulk up meatloaf or sprinkle on top of your favorite casserole before baking.The average shelf life of ground spices is about 6 months. After that they lose their potency and aren't as great for cooking. Instead, create your own scented candles by melting down old candle bits and blending them with spices like cinnamon or rosemary.If you like your coffee strong, then you probably won't be satisfied with expired beans. No need to toss them, use them as fertilizer in your garden. This is also a great way to squeeze extra value out of used coffee grounds.One last tip: Some food is only past its prime because of ""expired"" packaging. This could be a chocolate bar with Cupid on the wrapper or a box of crackers advertising an expired sweepstakes. These often end up heavily discounted in a grocer's clearance section or at a grocery outlet -- look for great deals on this type of clearance."

""Our study found that BPA may impair the development of the central nervous system, and raises the question as to whether exposure could predispose animals and humans to neurodevelopmental disorders,"" study researcher Dr. Wolfgang Liedtke, M.D., Ph.D., an associate professor of medicine/neurology and neurobiology at Duke University, said in a statement. Liedtke's research, which was conducted in animals, is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Much of humans' BPA exposure comes through what they eat and drink, via containers used to keep the food. BPA's effects on the human body are of concern because some research suggests it is an endocrine disruptor -- meaning it affects the way hormones work in the body, leading to possible reproductive and developmental effects, not to mention a possible link with a number of diseases and conditions, such as diabetes and obesity. Researchers noted that BPA is known to mimic estrogen in the body; the chemical is currently banned from baby bottles and cups in the U.S.In this newest study in rodents, researchers found that BPA could potentially have a negative effect on development of the central nervous system by shutting down a gene necessary to the process, called the Kcc2 gene. If this gene is shut down, the researchers noted that it doesn't produce a protein that plays an important role removing chloride from neurons -- a fundamental step in proper functioning of brain cells. ""Our findings improve our understanding of how environmental exposure to BPA can affect the regulation of the Kcc2 gene,"" Liedtke said in the statement. ""However, we expect future studies to focus on what targets aside from Kcc2 are affected by BPA. This is a chapter in an ongoing story.""Recently, the Silent Spring Institute published a study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, examining potential hormone-disrupting chemicals in common everyday products.

German health authorities have announced they suspect cucumbers, tomatoes and salad grown in northern Germany to be possible carriers of potentially lethal enterohemorrhagic E. coli, also known as the EHEC bacteria, in a an outbreak that has thus far inflicted over 400 people and caused one confirmed death since mid-May.

When I forget to mention this and see the greens severed from the root, the top two inches lopped off the end of a carrot, or half of a leek, lying in the sink, I want to jump off of my stool to rescue it saying, ""Noooo! It's all good!"" But, I remember how I used to do the same thing (because my mother did) until I learned just how important the ""whole food"" is. Of the online definitions, I think Wikipedia has the most in-depth definition. I would also include the Eastern perspective, which is a more holistic view of life in general, and takes the energy of the food into account. It teaches that people should eat the whole vegetable, the root and the greens together, as this is truly what a whole food is. It is believed that there is a certain energy that remains when eating the whole vegetable, in its entirety, leaving nothing to waste. If you look at a carrot, the root in the ground is growing downward, bringing us the earth's energy - likened to centrifugal force - in the vegetable. This energy is said to make a person feel more rooted or grounded. The carrot's greens, on the other hand, grow upward - bringing us the energy from the sun and the atmosphere. This is a more upward and outward energy, likened to centripetal force or what pulls a rotating object towards the center of what it's rotating around. This is said to bring us energy, which in turn, enables us to go out into the world. From this viewpoint, we should eat as much of the whole vegetable as possible to get a balance of these energies, and not waste an equally nutritious (link) part. Try something new. Look at a vegetable in its entirety. For example, take the whole carrot and cook as much of it as possible, both the orange root and the green tops (as suggested in the recipe below). The best roots and tops are the fresh ones purchased in a farmers' market, or pulled from your own garden. Sometimes, you can also find these in a regular grocery store.Or, next time you're garnishing something with a scallion - use the whole of it. If the ends (or roots) are fresh, white, plump and clean, and not dry and shriveled, use this part, too. Instead of cutting and throwing it away, eat the ""whole food."" Other root vegetables that have nutritious greens as tops include beets, daikon and red radishes.STEAMED CARROTS AND CARROT GREENS 1 large bunch of organic carrots with nice greens still attached water soy sauceSeparate the roots from their green tops.

Everett Koop speaks during a press conference in response to a report released by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) on the impact of light and low tar cigarettes November 27, 2001 in Washington, DC. The NCI report concluded that light and low tar cigarettes do not reduce smokers'' health risks.

Everett Koop passed away on Feb. 25, and I already really miss him. When I think about this revolutionary man, there are two words that come to mind: integrity and prevention. Although Dr. Koop was deeply conservative and religious, he was opposed by many on the left and the right because he had the integrity to go where the data took him, regardless of politics or his own personal opinions.To the almost incoherent rage of the Republican Party, Dr. Koop had the courage and persistence to argue for contraception and sexual education in schools as a necessary part of the war on AIDS. He was a man who stood his ground and followed the facts -- and the facts then, as they do now, frequently led to prevention because back then, finding a cure was hard to impossible. The iconic Dr. C. Everett Koop quote that will always stick with me is: ""You can't talk of the dangers of snake poisoning and not mention snakes.""  Again to the anger of the vested right-wing interests, Dr. Koop was never a stranger to making bold statements, and this applied to his stance on cigarettes as well. He once said clearly and honestly that nicotine has an addictiveness similar to that of heroin or cocaine and as Surgeon General waged a war against smoking with an aim to make the U.S. a smoke-free society by the year 2000. He was steadfast, because the facts were clear -- cigarettes were causing innumerable diseases, including lung cancer and emphysema, both painful ways to live and die. The only possible cure was prevention and, to everyone's surprise, once the U.S. embarked on changing smoking behavior, it worked. The number of active smokers in the U.S. has dropped from about 40 percent of the population in 1984 to  19.3 percent of U.S. adults in 2012. We all know that's still 45 million too many people, but if you do the math, it's 75 million fewer smokers than we would have if Dr. Koop hadn't spoken up and mandated the warning messages on every package of cigarettes. Contrast this success with the onset of obesity, which has tripled in adolescents in the the U.S., even as the rate of smoking has dropped to less than half of what it was. Now that anti-retroviral drugs have made AIDS a survivable or chronic disease, we seem to have forgotten the terror and fear that AIDS created in the mid-1980s. I lived in San Francisco from 1981 to 1989, and all around me people were dying, and it seemed that there was nothing we could do. It was awful, and at the time, all we could really do was prevent more people from getting AIDS. Dr. Koop showed us that preventing the spread of AIDS was eminently doable, and he did this despite his religious beliefs, because he was a man of integrity and a man of science. Thirteen years ago, Dr. Koop said, ""Except for smoking, obesity is now the No. 1 preventable cause of death in this country. Three hundred thousand people die of obesity and obesity-related illnesses (diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure) every year."" It seems likely that if he had been the Surgeon General then, we may already have seen a war on harmful eating similar to the one he waged on smoking -- and we may have similar results to show. Dr. Koop not only preached prevention, he took action to make it happen, but without him at the helm, obesity has almost doubled in the last 13 years and is now the No. 1 health crisis in the U.S. today.

10,TRAVEL,Carnival Triumph: There's More To The Story,"Stewart Chiron, Contributor
The Cruise Guy®, America's most quoted cruise expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carnival-triumph-theres-m_us_5b9cde14e4b03a1dcc82916b,"I've been asked several times if I feel comfortable and safe going on a cruise, especially after this latest incident. The simple answer is I wouldn't think twice and neither should you!",2013-02-28,"FILE - In this Feb. 14, 2013 file photo the cruise ship Carnival Triumph is towed into Mobile Bay near Dauphin Island, Ala., Thursday, Feb. 14, 2013. Want to know about a ship's track record for being clean? Want to assess how good or sanitary the food is? It's not that easy to find, in part because there's no one entity or country that oversees or regulates the industry with its fleet of ships that are like mini cities floating at sea. In the case of Carnival Cruise Lines, the owner of the Carnival Triumph that spent days in the Gulf of Mexico disabled after an engine fire, vacationers looking up information about the ship before boarding would have found mostly clean marks and few red flags. (AP Photo/Dave Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cde142100003100c54c24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been an eventful couple of weeks for the cruise industry. Carnival Cruise Lines' Carnival Triumph suffered a fire in its aft-engine room on the third morning of a four-night Western Caribbean cruise. According to Carnival, the ship was heading back to Galveston, Texas and was about 150 miles off of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and more than 250 miles from Progreso, Mexico. when the fire broke out disabling the ship's propulsion system. The US Coast Guard claimed they found exactly where the small fire ignited, which was a leak in a fuel oil return line that sprayed onto a hot surface. The ship's automatic fire extinguishing system was activated and doused the fire according to lead US Coast Guard Investigator, Lt. Cmdr. Teresa Hatfield. ""They did a very good job,"" she said.Carnival's emergency response teams were activated Sunday morning. Press statements and plans were quickly made known so media could accurately convey the latest developments. Before damage assessments were available, Carnival determined the ship needed assistance and dispatched two tug boats to tow the ship to port in case the ship's engines couldn't be restarted.Carnival advised there was a fire aboard the 13.5-year-old, 101,000-ton ship and that it had been extinguished with no casualties nor injuries to the 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew onboard. There was no propulsion power, but emergency generator power was activated with limited auxiliary power. Within hours, another cruise ship, Carnival Elation, rendezvoused with Carnival Triumph to deliver needed food, supplies and support.Within a day and a half of the fire, Triumph drifted about 90 additional miles because of strong winds and currents. On Monday, Carnival Legend arrived to offload tons of food and supplies to assist Triumph's passengers and crew.Taking the ship's current position into consideration, Carnival made the decision to have Triumph towed to Mobile, Alabama instead of Progreso, Mexico. It was stated that the ship was essentially equal distance to both ports. Considering 900 passengers didn't have passports, this avoided delays with Mexican and US immigration and customs authorities. The logistical nightmare of disembarking, housing and transporting 4,200 people to Merida or Cancun and flying back to Houston on charter flights would have possibly added another two or three days to the trip home for all of Triumph's passengers and crew.The first tugboat, which was dispatched from Mexico on Sunday, arrived at 6:30 p.m. Monday evening and began towing. The second tugboat, dispatched from Mobile, arrived Tuesday. Carnival Triumph was met by a third Carnival ship, Carnival Conquest, which offloaded more food and supplies. A total of four tug boats were used to push and pull Carnival Triumph toward Alabama. US Customs and Immigration authorities boarded Triumph while still under tow to quickly clear the passengers and expedite the disembarkation process once the ship finally reached Mobile.Many people questioned why Carnival didn't transfer the passengers to another ship and the simple answer was they didn't want to risk the safety of the passengers and crew. They were extremely uncomfortable but weren't in imminent danger. The weather had drastically changed overnight with seas reaching up to 10 feet with 30 knot winds. The risk of injury greatly increased with the deteriorating weather conditions, so the decision to keep the passengers onboard and safe was prudent and responsible.Imagine trying to load 40 people into a 20 passenger elevator. These other ships were completely full. If there was an emergency, arrangements would have been made as many ships were in the area, but again, passengers were not in any danger, just incredibly uncomfortable.What was horribly painful for us viewers was the shameful media coverage by certain networks. They pulled out the hurricane handbook and went wall-to-wall with their coverage. Their intent was simply over-dramatization for ratings. The coverage was excruciating, redundant and at times, unnewsworthy. Some networks preyed on the suffering of these cruise passengers providing the same story, different person, repeatedly, for the entire day. Media overused the vocal minority and weren't interested in the silent majority.Several people brought up the mechanical condition of the ship, questioning its seaworthiness. Carnival Triumph was recently inspected by the US Coast Guard in November 2012. Previous repairs had nothing to do with the fuel leak that caused the fire and disabled Triumph.The oceans and ships are the lifeline of the cruise industry. No cruise line is going to knowingly sacrifice passenger or ship safety. A careless disaster could be not only be devastating for the company but also for the entire industry.Carnival Cruise Lines provided each passenger with a complete refund, a free future cruise credit plus an additional $500 per person as additional compensation. Carnival isn't as large and successful as it is because of their good looks. They provide a safe, quality product that people from around the world enjoy year after year. As for the industry, each cruise line offers very different products and experiences, but safety is paramount. Keep in mind, cruise ships are machines and machines do break down.The good news is that there hasn't been a negative consumer response relating to Triumph. The current wave season continues to be strong for the industry, as evidenced by higher pricing, year-over-year. None of the cruise lines have engaged in ""panic pricing."" Current cruise sales by several cruise lines, including Carnival, are almost identical in nature with their usual offers. Upgrades, reduced deposits, shipboard credits and the like were offered before and after Carnival Triumph's fire. Cruise passengers feel safe, supported by the undisputed fact that over 150 million people have cruised over the past decade, incident-free.One of the many lessons I've learned in the industry over the past 24 years is that policies and procedures are constantly evolving. Nothing is etched in stone and improvements will always be made, especially when safety is concerned.I'm confident that Carnival learned a great deal from this horrible experience and will share its findings with the entire industry as the matter unfolds. This situation should never happen again, but when it does, better preparation and response will undoubtedly ensue.I've been asked several times if I feel comfortable and safe going on a cruise, especially after this latest incident. The simple answer is I wouldn't think twice and neither should you!"
