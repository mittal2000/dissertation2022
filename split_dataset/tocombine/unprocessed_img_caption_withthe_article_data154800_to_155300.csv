And while this can certainly be applied to the ""big picture"" life stuff, it can also apply to the more practical.",2013-05-15,Young woman sitting on a hardwood floor gazing at her unorganized closet. Vertical shot.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d27583c000032000a08b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Changes in season are beautiful markers of time and, perhaps even more beautiful, opportunities to take stock and evaluate. And while this can certainly be applied to the ""big picture"" life stuff, it can also apply to the more practical. As days become longer and temperatures warmer, just as with the opposite, our wardrobes and closets transition to accommodate the change. With these twice-yearly seasonal switch-outs comes a real opportunity -- a chance to edit what you have and assess what you really need.A closet is such a special space, perhaps the most personal and sacred in your entire home. It is a reflection of you -- what you love, what you are drawn to, what makes you tick -- and something that is entirely your own. A closet can hold so many memories. It's amazing how many moments, both happy and sad, can be attached to your wardrobe and personal effects. So it's not all material after all...I love my closet -- it's a space that I have shaped over the years to resemble a carefully curated little boutique. Unfortunately, I do have to share this space with my husband, so the ability to be ever-expanding is limited, but perhaps that is a good thing. I dislike clutter in my life, and my closet is no different. I like to be able to see clearly what I have in front of me. That said, I also obviously love clothes, so for me, it's about finding the balance between the two.Do you feel comforted when surrounded by large quantities of things? I, personally, feel the need to be surrounded by the things that I love and wear. I could pull anything from my closet and know that it will work. I am big on editing, clear on what I'll never wear again and have over the years built a pretty cool wardrobe filled with great pieces. At the end of the day, no matter how many things you do have, there will always be the occasional feeling that you have nothing to wear. That's why I like to edit -- built in permission to invest in something new.Do you? It can be hard when emotional attachments get involved. The dress that you wore when you met your boyfriend, the first expensive piece that you splurged on, those fancy, iconic bags that just aren't you anymore... Whatever the attachment, deep down you know if you will never wear it again. As a rule, if I haven't worn something in the last year, it's time for us to part ways. And if I have even the slightest doubt, I wait and revisit when I make my next round of edits, eliminating the possibility of regret.My unofficial 10 commandments of recycling:Reasons to edit: • Fashion and fits are ever-evolving. This is way too Spring 2010. • I love the style, but what was I thinking when I bought this color? • This reminds me of the old me. I lost weight and will certainly not allow myself to gain it back! • I have tried this dress on several times but never end up wearing it. • I only wear my favorite tees (the ones on top of my tee-shirt pile). • I always wear the same perfectly fitted black blazer, though I have a collection of others. • I haven't worn it in one year, two years...whatever number feels right for you.Reasons to keep: • I haven't worn this trench in years, but it's truly a classic piece that will never go out of style. • This piece is an heirloom and elicits so many beautiful memories. • I am not wearing it, but I am saving it for my daughters one day.Fashion is ever-evolving and so are you, so edit accordingly. My latest obsession, aka the new Céline mules, will find a place on my shelf instead of those open toe Louboutin heels that I will NEVER wear again...Recycle. Those ultra-forgiving Lanvin dresses were gorgeous...when I was pregnant....Recycle. What was I thinking when I bought that Isabel Marant Western shirt...Recycle.Recycling will make someone extremely happy and will give you the room and budget for your next inevitable splurge.At the end of the day, we don't need any of this.

But living life to the fullest doesn't mean the same thing for everyone.",2013-05-14,Woman taking pictures on pier over a pond surrounded by woods.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d26db2000004e00fdd958.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've been reading a lot of posts by people who encourage others to live in the  moment, and to not put too much faith in the future, and that all we have is  the here and now. Well, I hope you're not tired of hearing about this topic,  because here is another one:In a desperate attempt to do the things we think will leave us with a sense of  accomplishment, fulfillment, and satisfaction, we risk missing out on those  things that actually do. We all know, in one variation or another, the saying,  ""the past is the past."" Well, if I had to make a choice, I'd rather look back on  the things I was able to do, that made me happy, rather than look ahead to things  I might never get to do. But I'm not at the point yet where I need to start looking back,  and I'm too focused on what's happening to me in this moment to look forward. I do what I want to do, now. I trust my gut and do what my body and brain think will  fit best in my life at this moment, and just go with the flow.I'm not sure who said this, but I like it, and maybe you will too: ""If you want to be sad, live in the past. If you want to be anxious, live in the future.  If you want to be peaceful, live in the now.""I'm peaceful, are you?When I was younger, I lived the ""childhood dream"" of going to Disney World. I was  very young, but one of the few things I remember clearly was a place in  Epcot Center called the ""Carousel Of Progress."" It was a sort of ride, where you sat  on your butt the whole time and the seats moved around in a circle, stopping in front  of animatronic interpretations of the future (if you're bored, YouTube it, it's actually  pretty interesting to see what people thought the future would be).Aaaanyway, the theme song playing during the ride had a chorus that I, along with  my sister, sung repeatedly, and still do, because it's catchy, and brings back  good memories, and makes us smile. But it wasn't until I was older that I truly ""got"" the meaning.To help you play along with the craziness of my brain, here's the chorus:""Now is the time, now is the best time, now is the best time of your life.  Life is a prize, live every minute, open your eyes and watch how you win it.""See, the past is important, because it got us to where we are now. And ""now"" is  important, because it will guide us to the future. And the future is important because,  when living in the now, or thinking about the past, gets us down, it's fun to imagine  the things that could be. But, since the future is uncertain, and the past already happened,  the most important place and time we have, is now, and it's fabulous. Life is definitely  a prize, but we don't have to do anything special to win it. Just opening our eyes is enough. Opening them and declaring, ""I am here and it is now,"" and allowing  ourselves to be at peace with who, what, and where we are.Has this post been schmaltzy enough for ya? No? Well, then keep reading...Living life to the fullest doesn't mean the same thing for everyone. Just because  you're not climbing Mt. Everest, jumping out of planes, or, um, doing something  else that sounds like it might be really amazing, that doesn't mean your life is  any less fulfilling. If what you do means something to you at that moment, it  means something to your life overall, regardless of what other people are doing,  or are telling you to do. When you're diagnosed with cancer, there's all this pressure to get out  and ""live your life,"" and anxiety about being judged for taking life for granted  now that you're staring your mortality in the face. But, ya know what?, I don't  know about you, but sometimes I feel like lying around like a bump on a log,  watching a movie, reading a book, or doing something others might consider  a waste of time. But whatever I do, whether it's going out and walking 8 miles, going to dinner and a movie, or a party, or making sure the butt mark in my  couch stays fresh, that day matters, because I lived it. From the moment I open  my eyes in the morning, to the time I shut them at night, I'm alive, I'm here, doing what I want. I'm not going to feel guilty for not ""getting myself out there""  and forcing myself to do something I didn't really want to do, just because  someone else thinks I should.Right now I'm back in treatment, getting another course of radiation, hoping with all that I have that the cancer in my sternum will hate the new warmer  climate radiation is providing, and move out, for good. The treatment is  making me tired. I'm able to get out most days and walk those eight miles  (okay, usually closer to four or five, but still), but then I come home and crash.  Yes, I've been invited out to dinner, and the movies, and other events at night,  and yes, part of me feels like I ""should"" go, but another part says, ""you know what, you had a good day, you got out and walked, and talked to people, and, oh yeah, spent another day fighting for your life, take the damn night off.""When you have cancer, waking up in the morning is your greatest accomplishment,  you've already won the prize. Anything you do after that is just icing on the cake."

Every day, thousands of people from all over the country, in everything from fishing skiffs to million-dollar yachts, travel this ""highway for boaters"" that stretches more than 150 miles to Fort Myers.This waterway, just one segment of a massive, 3,000-mile shipping route that runs along both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, also is a gateway to some of the state's most beautiful getaways.Over the years, hundreds of great waterfront restaurants, hotels, marinas and shipyards have sprung up to serve locals and cruisers traveling the Intracoastal.But Florida's natural barrier islands along the Gulf Coast are a draw themselves. Many are now state parks; others national wildlife refuges; some merely are sandbars that shift with each passing storm.Anclote Key State Park, with its great fishing and bird watching, gets its share of visitors. Most people approach the island from the north because the deeper water there is a better place to anchor big boats.The state has built pavilions in the middle of the island on the gulf side and one at the north end at the designated primitive campground. The picnic areas have composting toilet facilities, and tables and grills are available on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no electricity or running water, and visitors must dispose of their own garbage.Southward lies Caladesi Island State Park, with a beach consistently ranked among the world's Top 10 by Florida International University coastal geologist Stephen Leatherman, also known as Dr. Beach.Leatherman considers 50 criteria when making his picks, including current, sand quality and water clarity. Caladesi scores high in all areas, but the lack of crowds makes it especially appealing.For years the island was accessible only by boat. Since Hurricane Elena filled Dunedin Pass with sand in 1985, adventurous souls have been able to make the long walk from Clearwater Beach.Boaters will find Caladesi Island particularly accommodating because of a new 108-slip marina on the east side. Overnight docking with electricity and water hook-ups are available, but boaters must register before sundown.The state park, which has picnic pavilions, bathrooms and a concession stand, also can be accessed by a passenger ferry, which departs nearby Honeymoon Island at 10 a.m. daily, weather permitting.But of all the barrier islands stretching from Cape Sable in the south to Anclote Key in the north, none has a history as rich as Egmont Key.During the third Seminole War, the Army held Seminole prisoners here. During the Civil War, it served as a Union naval base. During the Spanish-American War, huge guns were positioned here to guard the mouth of Tampa Bay.Since 1974, when Egmont Key was designated a national wildlife sanctuary, it has been better known for its natural history. The island is a critical nesting area for numerous threatened and endangered migratory shore birds, and for loggerhead sea turtles.Though there is no public transportation to the 400-acre island, thousands of people visit Egmont Key every year by boat. It is undoubtedly one of the most popular destinations for recreational anglers and boaters on Florida's west coast.Boaters can pull up on the beach on the windward side of the island or drop anchor and wade ashore on the leeward side.Other great state parks along the Intracoastal Waterway on Florida's West Coast, include:• Cayo Costa State Park • Don Pedro Island State Park • Stump Pass Beach State Park in Boca Grande • Lovers Key State Park • Collier-Seminole State Park • Delnor-Wiggins Pass State ParkThe Intracoastal Waterway is well-maintained and well-marked, but it's always good to boat with a GPS and local chart kit.But the most important thing a boater, sailor or angler needs is a sense of adventure to make the most of these public resources.-- Terry Tomalin, VISIT FLORIDA"

Known simply as ""Kenneth"" and dubbed the first celebrity hairdresser according to The New York Times, Battelle began his career by enlisting in the Navy at 17 and then attended Syracuse University on the G.I. Bill. In response to an ad that promised a salary of $100 per week, he enrolled in beauty school, much to his mother's dismay, and landed his first job at the Starlet Beauty Bar in Syracuse.Climbing his way up the ranks, Battelle began working for Helena Rubinstein in New York--a salon Jackie Kennedy frequented. As the story goes, according to The Telegraph, Mrs. Kennedy stopped by the salon in 1954 looking for her stylist of choice who happened to be out sick. The receptionist called for Battelle who quickly reinvented Jackie's famous hairstyle--from the short and layered cut to the soft bouffant she became known for. Gaining notoriety, Battelle was the only hairstylist to receive the Coty American Fashion Critics' Award in 1961. He later opened his own salon in New York in 1963, appropriately named ""Kenneth"", and according to People counted among his clients Joan Rivers, Lucille Ball, Brooke Astor, Judy Garland, and Audrey Hepburn.He is survived by his three sisters Joan Conine, Jane Lyon, and Lynn Johnson, and of course, by the salon that still bears his name."

I was at Microsoft, where we were developing a new travel product that would become Expedia, and we had the idea to use a new web technology called Live Chat to convey from the field the adventure of travel. I had the idea that I would cover the running of the bulls by standing in a doorway on the route of the stampede, and report live what was happening. But when the canon went off, a river of people charged down the street, and scooped me out of the doorway and into the fray. The 90 thousand people from around the world who tuned in to hear my reportage heard only screams as I ran with the bulls to the stadium.Afterwards I checked out the bulletin boards that had the hundreds of photos taken by photographers on the balconies, and there were several sequences of a bull with his horn just inches from my back.The experience was how some describe adventure today... a well-planned trip gone wrong... but it wasn't always this way.Europe is where Adventure Travel was born. Today it is a 150-billion-dollar industry, and accounts for 26 percent of all tourism departures worldwide.So, why do we take Adventure Travel Trips? In 1735, the British poet Sir Hildebrand Jacob wrote, ""A mind truly disposed for the perceptions of that which is great and marvelous is a product of Nature and cannot be attained through study."" In other words, it's good to get outdoors.In 1757, the Irish philosopher Edmund Burke tried to account for the passions evoked in the human mind by what he called ""terrible objects."" He was interested in our psychic response to things -- a rushing cataract, a soaring cliff face, an avalanche -- that seized, terrified, and yet also somehow pleased the mind by dint of being too big, too high, too fast, too powerful, too uncontrollable to be properly comprehended. These sights inspired a heady blend of pleasure and terror; these were the sights of Adventure. In Burke's theory, beauty, which was about balance and grace, has a relaxing effect on the ""fibers of the body,"" whereas adventure tightens these same fibers. He wrote: ""Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling."" He went on to posit that terror was a passion which ""always produces delight when it does not press too close."" So, as in riding on a mountain train, or skiing a steep slope, kayaking a fast river or hiking through the wilderness it is the suggestion of harm, melded with the knowledge that no harm will likely come, which induces the sensation of delightful terror. It's why we ride roller coasters, and why we take adventure-travel trips. But it's not just an elective. Adventure, which stimulates the evolution of consciousness, is necessary. As the English mathematician Alfred North Whitehead said, ""Without adventure, civilization is in full decay.""So, who were these first adventurers, and why?Adventure was not a motivation for the first travelers through Europe. They were pilgrims, hunters, Crusaders heading for the Holy Land; mercenaries, messengers, tradesmen, smugglers and other criminals. Most of these voyagers avoided the ""hills whose heads touch heaven,"" afraid of the uncanny powers that lurked within. They did not want to be in the mountains of Europe; they did not want unnecessary adventure.A half century before Christ the Romans considered the Alps inhospitable, desolate, hostile -- ocris, arduus, horridus. The Roman poet, Titus Lucretius Carus, called the Alps the waste places of the world, where Nature had swept its rubbish.For generations after the Romans, mountains signified only the deformed and execrable, thinly soiled, steeply sloped, bad for farming, ordeals to cross, the lairs of demons and trolls. The Welsh priest Adam of Usk was so petrified when he crossed the Gotthard Pass in 1402 he had to be blindfolded, and travelers after him would often close the carriage curtains to avoid the dreadful scenes of the Alps. Anything could happen in this icy semi-circle of teeth that bit off Italy from the rest of Europe. Not only were the Alps scary; but they also were ugly, warts on the skin of the Earth; boils on its face. The classical notions of beauty called for purity, order, restraint, regularity, proportion -- perfection; while The Alps were disordered, irregular, chaotic, and bad-mannered. The monk John de Bremble was so horrified by his experience crossing the Great St. Bernard Pass that he prayed, ""Lord restore me to my brethren, that I may tell them not to come to this place of torment."" Bishop Berkeley, crossing the Alps in 1714, carped that, ""Every object that here presents itself is excessively miserable."" Fantastic beliefs are not just a trait of modern politicians. In 1723, a Swiss Fellow of the Royal Society, Johann Jakob Scheuchzer, penned a famous ""dracopedia"" with detailed description of alpine dragons he had seen. And he believed that certain chamois possessed a stone in their bellies that rendered them immune to bullets.And it wasn't just the mountains that evoked these feelings. In 1791 the English cleric William Gilpin noted that ""the generality of people found wilderness dislikable."" ""There are few,"" he wrote,"" ""who do not prefer the busy scenes of cultivation to the greatest of nature's rough productions."" It's interesting that if you look back before the 18th century there is virtually no literature that praises Grand Nature or the adventures found within... nothing in Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare or Milton... it's all about the human form, about delicate beauty, about ordered gardens and symmetrical patterns. Unless a soldier, pilgrim or pirate, adventure was anathema.So, how did this mindset change? When did they pull back the curtains? In 1739, Cambridge professor Thomas Gray took the Grand Tour, crossed the Alps, and wrote letters in which he used the adjectives ""romantic"" and ""poetic,"" and the phrases, ""a sacred terror"" and ""a severe delight."" With these words he put himself in a dramatic story, and turned the pages that grew a movement. In 1775 Jean-Jacques Rousseau found his narrative voice and turned it on: ""I must have torrents, rocks, pines, dead forest, mountains, rugged paths to go up and down, precipices beside to frighten me."" Then the Industrial Revolution, which motivated record numbers to leave farms and crowd to the cities. Suddenly places like London were dirty, smoggy, disease and crime-ridden -- this was the setting that gave Charles Dickens his work. People lost faith in God and humanity.But when the rock star Romantic poets... Lord Byron, Percy Shelly, Mary Shelly... who wrote Frankenstein... William Wordsworth, John Ruskin and others set out to adventure in the Alps, they found landscapes clean and green, dangerous and overwhelming, and it made them feel more alive, it made them believe in something powerful -- and they called the feelings they evoked as""An Agreeable Kind of Horror"" ""A Magnificent Rudeness"" ""A Rapturous Terror"" ""A Turbulent Pleasure""These were feelings on the other side of thought and language... this was adventure.And it was one of the most profound revolutions in thought that ever occurred -- the transition from a loathing of Grand Nature to its celebration. And adventure travel was hatched. The Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix was founded in 1821, and quickly became the biggest guide company in the world, attending to the thousands who followed in the footsteps of the Romantics.Trains then democratized adventure. This despite early sentiments that the rapid movement of trains would cause brain damage and other ill-effects. Thomas Cook -- the Richard Branson of his day -- helped prove those sentiments wrong. In 1855 he brought a tour group of 62 from England to the Continent for the first time, paving the way for cross sections of society to experience what had long been the province of the privileged. At last everyone could be a character is his own moving adventure play.Cook wrote what is perhaps the best brochure copy ever. He said adventure travel ""provides food for the mind; it contributes to the strength and enjoyment of the intellect; it helps pull men out of the mire and pollution of old corrupt customs; it promotes a feeling of universal brotherhood; it accelerates the march of peace and virtue, and love; it also contributes to the health of the body, by a relaxation from the toil and the invigoration of the physical powers.""  In 1888 French author Alphonse Daudet wrote that ""The ubiquitous impulse to leave the beaten track had been tapped and its fulfillment made available."" Europe was now ground zero for the exploding pike of adventure travel. And it remained so for over a century.So, what then happened? The rest of the world caught up, and in many ways took over what Europe started. The Himalaya took the climbers and trekkers; Africa poached the wildlife seekers; Latin America stole the romantics. Parts of Europe today are more American than America, yet with more rules. But things are changing again, and herein lies the opportunity; to get back to where we once belonged.In this age of GPS tracking, big data and disintermediation, adventure travel has become more and more analytical. More statistically driven; more about cost benefits analyses, about benchmarking; about safety, about quantifying guilt with tree plantings and pollution credits.   But the underlying enthusiasm for adventure remains the script with the participant as hero, the three act structure of challenge, struggle and resolution; the quest for the agreeable kind of horror Joseph Addison described in 1701. There is a fundamental delight in being close to danger. As someone who has spent some time exploring wild rivers in remote corners, and who holds the distinction of having capsized on six continents, I know this notion -- that life is more intensely lived the closer one gets to its extinction. We never feel so alive as when we purl by the eddy of death.Our impulses today remain as energetic as ever, eager for the romance, mystery and the vulnerability tapped in wild places... and these attributes argue for preservation, and visitation. Most people won't be compelled to take an adventure because the lodge uses certain light bulbs or soap or low volume toilets; or hires locals; or carbon offsets, though these are necessary and good practices. What most folks seek, I believe, are the unfathomable shadows where the wild things are. Our human DNA compels us to crave exploration, transformation, resonance, and a story that stars us. Yet too many adventure experiences around the world have become internment centers mapped and planned with no blank spots. The trails are overly-marked and monitored; the buses are video-enabled, so you can watch the movie Brave rather than the castle outside the window. Around the world at pool sides and lobbies, visitors watch from a safe distance ethnic spectacles and performances, loaded with Post-it Note mysticism. The deep, rich cultures and traditions are too often reduced to dinner shows for the mobile rich. In these brief, one-sided encounters, there is little chance to understand the people behind the dances, no real celebration of a vibrant, living culture. Visitors are offered the bread crumbs on the floor beneath the big table of cultural understanding. In these dynamics, there is little room for true discovery; little prospect for a story that makes sense of who we are; little chance for profound adventure.And there is little opportunity for magic and luck. The Danish Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr, who nailed a horseshoe above his office door for good luck, was asked by a colleague, ""You don't really believe in this stuff, do you?"" To which Bohr replied, ""No, but I've heard it works even for people who don't believe."" ****Yes, the wilderness is vanishing, and cultures are fading, but what saves them are not dry statistics and doomsday scenarios, but rather the emotional sumptuousness and connection that comes from visitation. We have to lead from the heart, not the head. Our job is to figure out how to inspire someone on a couch in America or Asia watching his television or computer screen to get up and make that step and come see and feel the witchcraft of European wilderness. Once so touched, travelers become the most passionate advocates for place and preservation, as the trees and brooks and wild things are as family.If pieces of Europe can be unmediatedly wild -- like, for instance, Sutjeska National Park in Bosnia, where I recently got lost, afraid to go off path for fear of landmines... If pieces of Europe can be unmediatedly wild, without the requisite security and compliant spaces, without adult supervision, it is then faithful to our childlike imaginations of wilderness. The natural sublime is as much about awe as real danger -- the peril of avalanches in the Alps; the risks of wild rivers in the Balkans; or the hazards of fjords in Norway. Real adventure attracts like moths to a flame, where we feel most alive when we can imagine our own demise. Adventure ought to be the great, original quest, an individual tale of privation, courage, constant vigilance and danger. Done right, it is a journey undertaken with only a fragmentary map constructed out of a patchwork of accumulated local lore and the occasional milepost marked ""here be dragons.""If we decode adventure travel it fulfills the desire to find a new way of being, an experience unpredictable, immediate, and true. One of my favorite films is Michelangelo Antonioni's The Passenger, in which Jack Nicholson plays a disillusioned journalist who decides to abandon his past and assume the role of a dead stranger. The tale is a journey though landscapes of identity and mystery, shimmering with danger and uncertainty. And it occurs to me that any adventure travel trip is a similar chance for reinvention, for becoming someone different, perhaps someone better; a chance to explore the inaccessible landscapes and unmapped countries within each of us.Yet the adventures of today, all over the world, have become too circumscribed. There is a powerful quality in being open-ended, vague at the borders; of being sufficiently unpolished that a visitor can expand upon it in his own mind, projecting himself into its narratives. Too many adventure providers today are like unctuous butlers of the imagination, ready to serve every need or desire as it arises; they don't leave anything implied, unstated or incomplete. They don't allow us to get lost.The key here, of course, is akin to trundling on a train through the Alps... Europe today, unlike much of the world, can offer up the delight of the illusion of menace, the idea of danger, all with a comfortable seat and a nicely structured glass of wine. And it offers, as well, the adventures outside the train. Not many places can offer both.This is the opportune moment for Europe. While economies stagger, tourism has never been more alluring, more important, for both the traveler and the destination. We can re-imagine, re-brand, and retrofit to bring back the thrills that once defined the continent. This is the time to let the chaos of adventure shimmer through the veil of order; to be open to tearing down the grid that has lidded the wild places, to peel back some rules, to strip the veneer of worldliness and return to some more primitive, if more demanding, state of grace, remembering, and perhaps retweeting, that Europe is where it all began."

In its latest outbreak in its Eastern Province, it said it had had 15 confirmed cases, of whom nine had died.World Health Organisation officials visiting Saudi Arabia to consult with the authorities on the outbreak said on Sunday it seemed likely the new virus could be passed between humans, but only after prolonged, close contact.The new virus (nCov) can cause coughing, fever and pneumonia. A virus from the same family triggered the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that swept the world after emerging in Asia and killed 775 people in 2003.French authorities announced on Sunday that a second man had been diagnosed with the disease after sharing a hospital room with France's only other sufferer, who had recently travelled in the Middle East.
