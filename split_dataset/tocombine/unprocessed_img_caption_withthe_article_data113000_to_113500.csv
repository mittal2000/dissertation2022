0,TASTE,"Cooking Off the Cuff: For the Corniest Corn Ravioli, Fire Up the Grill (Pan)","Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-for_b_5672166.html,"While not unheard-of, corn ravioli are uncommon enough that they're always a happy, delicious surprise, especially at this time of year, when they can be made from fresh locally grown corn.",2014-08-13,"For intense flavor, char the corn on a grill pan (or a grill)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e3c7a240000320053e659.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"One of life's little pleasures is biting into a plump piece of stuffed pasta and finding something unexpected inside -- assuming it's something nice. While not unheard-of, corn ravioli are uncommon enough that they're always a happy, delicious surprise, especially at this time of year, when they can be made from fresh locally grown corn. Years and years ago, I tried out a filling that was basically creamed corn. It was pleasant, but no more so than just eating the corn with a spoon. Since then Jackie and I have had the version served at restaurant Jean-Georges in New York: very corny, very flavorful, very elegant -- and a little too elaborate in their sauce and accompaniments for me to feel like trying to emulate them, though I'll eat them any day of the week if someone else cooks them. But there's one thing about their filling that has made all the difference to the way I make them at home: The corn is charred before being cut from the cob and cooked with shallots and cream. This adds a new layer of flavor and lowers the corn's water content. The Jean-Georges dish keeps the kernels whole and uses extraordinarily thin pasta wrappers: perfect with the accompanying tomatoes and copious but light basil puree. For home-made ravioli I prefer more homogeneous fillings and slightly more substantial pasta for a heartier raviolo that's also easier to handle. Here's how I've been making them this corn season.A few hours in advance (or the day before) I shuck four plump ears of corn and cut each crosswise into three shorter segments: Their tapered shape prevents whole ears from lying flat on the grill pan. This makes enough for six generous appetizer portions. I then cook them (without any oil or seasoning) on a medium-hot ridged grill pan; if I had a real grill and felt like stoking the fire, I imagine I'd use that. I leave them alone till they are dark brown in places -- just shy of black here and here is fine, but you don't want them to actually carbonize -- then give them a little turn and repeat. The end result will be corn that's cooked and unevenly charred -- even the places that haven't browned will deepen in color. This can take 20 minutes or longer.Meanwhile, I'm sweating two medium shallots, minced, in butter with salt and a generous amount of finely chopped fresh sage (another herb would be fine, of course).After the corn has cooled enough to handle, I cut off the kernels and scrape off the starchy juice/pulp, all of which I add to the shallots over medium-high heat. When they've started to cook I pour in half a cup (say, 120 ml) white wine and reduce it to almost nothing, then a similar amount of heavy cream. When this comes to the boil, I transfer everything to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until it has formed a slightly coarse puree. This goes back into the pan, where I stir it over medium heat until it looks rather dry. If you taste it at this point (which you must do for the sake of seasoning -- it will need salt and pepper), you will find that it is actually not dry at all. Transfer the mixture, perfectly seasoned, to a bowl, let it cool, then refrigerate it. When cold, it will congeal and be easy to divide into portions either with a spoon or using a pastry bag.Make two eggs' worth of pasta -- I start with 200 g (7 oz) flour -- and roll it out on a pasta machine to the second-to-finest thickness. Form your ravioli using 1/2 Tablespoon filling apiece. You can make them any shape you like; my current favorite (as illustrated in the accompanying photos) is based on what are called ravioli del plin (or agnolotti del plin). There are dozens of good videos on the Web showing how to make this shape and so many others.If you're not cooking them immediately, you can refrigerate the ravioli for a couple of hours or, better, freeze them even if you're planning to use them the same day: There's less chance of the moisture in the filling compromising the pasta wrapper. From frozen, they take around six minutes (you want the pasta silky, not chalky); if just made, they'll take four and a half or five minutes.I've always liked sweet peppers with corn, and I recently served these ravioli with diced roasted red pepper warmed through in butter. It was nice, but not as nice as my default ""sauce"": Heat plenty of butter in a skillet with sage leaves, and when the ravioli are nearly done add diced peeled tomatoes (quartered grape tomatoes are perfect) and salt, then toss the drained pasta in this instantaneous tomato sauce. I don't see that grated parmesan does anything for these ravioli, but I wouldn't withhold it from cheese aficionados.Because of the initial grilling and the concentration of flavor and aroma, the corn in this filling tastes half again as corny as un-charred corn. And since corn accounts for probably 95 percent of the mixture, it truly is a lovely summer surprise to find in your pasta. "

Viktor Orban of Hungary the new Band of Brothers? They can proudly declare that they have created hybrid systems, illiberal regimes in their countries, with their structures of democracy castrated (my sincere apologies to the eunuchs of the Ottoman Empire) over the last few years. Historically Russia, Turkey and indeed Hungary have been vacillating between the West and the East, between Charlemagne and Genghis Khan as their role model. Yet again they seem to be in their ""Genghis"" phase.While one should be aware of the enormous differences among their leaders, there are some striking similarities. All three are talented politicians. They have all acquired a taste for lasting power and have decided to stay in the leading position of their countries for a very long time. Ideology, process and politics, formal democracy are for them mere tools in the service of achieving this goal.No doubt, Putin, Erdogan and Orban all have an amazing sense of understanding of the soul (read: the fears) of their population. They are addressing the dreams of their people of past glories and grandeur, build their ideology on the ""exceptionalism"" of their nation [sorry America, you are not alone in this game]. They also build on nationalism and xenophobia, and fail to realize that it is exactly the crossbreeding of their diverse nationalities that have been a major source of strength through the centuries. Their ambition is to be the leading force and perhaps the example in their respective regions ( believe it or not, Orban included), seeing themselves as a source of inspiration for others. They build on the sentiments of abandonment by the West in the broader population. (Here we must admit: Viktor Orban is somewhat of a cuckoo's egg in this nest as he is the Prime Minister of a country that is a member of the European Union and which would be totally bankrupt without the 17 billion Euro assistance that was poured into the country during 10 years of membership.)Their animosity towards the West is personal. It is driven by the fear of democracy, with its checks and balances, and with election systems that, despite all its faults, still makes political change possible. Some of the reasons for their emergence is of our own making, which lie in our complacency. We took the victorious, unstoppable and continuing advances of democracy in the world for granted. The West was not empathetic to the sufferings and difficulties on the road of transition in Eastern Europe, failing to understand the threats posed by disappointment. Europe has not been generous to Turkey, whose membership in the EU should have been granted a long time ago, thus it let pro western elites down.We need to be careful in drawing conclusions, however. Erdogan might come to his senses, and not aim for a 99 percent win five years from now. His victory is hardly overwhelming. The election results no doubt show strong signs of health in Turkish society. Hungarians are quietly building steam. Orban is overly complacent, a sure sign of the beginning of the end. Putin needed the invasion of a sovereign country to boost his popularity. We must be clear in our message: no one should see the impotence of some leaders in the West as the downfall and the end of western democracies. The response to the malfunctioning, even serious crisis of liberal democracies is not illiberal ""democracies"" but better, more robust democracies. The response to weak western leadership should not be the acceptance of the model of autocratic leadership from authoritarian states, but good, solid, pragmatic and consensus based leadership of the rule of law. The response to a runaway press in a value crisis is not state control and censorship of the media, but the reestablishment of the moral standards of journalism. The answer to a debilitating inequality of the distribution of wealth in our societies is not the creation of a new class of robber barons and oligarchs, nor the stifling of competition, but a stronger oversight and transparency of economic and business transactions. Lasting answers to the challenges of the 21st Century lie in strong democratic institutions.It is in our interest to hold up the experiences of the Nordic countries as the example to follow. Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland have all responded to the recent threats and challenges with a call for more democracy, not less. More diversity, not less. More solidarity, not less. More open and more competitive economies, not isolation and autarchy.The contagion of the illiberal model (recently openly praised by Viktor Orban in a public speech as the real alternative to the ""failed liberal western system"") is yet another wake up call for us to understand the realities of the world, which is a mess. Surrender is no option. This Band of Brothers better get ready for rough times ahead. Democracies will strike back. With more democracy, not less."

For so many people, such recollections are riddled with a feeling that had one more phone call been made, one more visit paid or extended, an ounce more empathy or sympathy expressed, the outcome could have been different. It's a heavy burden to carry, the pain perhaps second only to the loss incurred.Rationally speaking, there is likely nothing anyone could have done. Williams had access to the best mental health care, unlike so many millions of sufferers. In the U.S.A., more people die of suicide each year than in road accidents.  I still remember the pain of wondering ""if only"" with regard to a member of my own family. I believed then that much of life could be controlled; I wasn't yet aware of the extent to which some things lie totally beyond our influence.  This doesn't mean we should throw up our hands when a loved one is deeply depressed. We should, however, be appalled at how difficult it can be for people with mental health issues to access care in America and around the world. It's shameful how emergency-oriented the mental health ""system"" has become. The average hospital stay for psychiatric inpatients is a woefully inadequate seven days -- and that only when admission is gained, which usually requires the perception of imminent harm to self or others. As Allen Frances, Duke University professor emeritus, wrote only days ago, ""This is the worst of times and places for many people with severe mental illnesses.""  With so much to learn about the human brain, and despite political progress, we've been stalled by the stigma of mental illness and deceived by yesterday's promises of deinstitutionalization and ""mainstreaming"" that came to mean nothing more than ostracizing and criminalizing patients. Until we understand that mental illness is not something that happens to other people -- and to other people's families and children -- but rather a capricious visitor who may well have your address, we'll continue to allow millions of people, who could be helped, to suffer and perhaps to die.As we take in the tragedy of Robin Williams' passing, we should also reject the shambles that is mental health care for most Americans. If there is an ""if only"" that makes sense, it is a societal one. Not everyone can be saved and certainly not indefinitely, but people who treat or support mental health patients, including families and friends, need to speak loudly about how a society that purports to be civilized, and whose representatives until recently bragged ignorantly of having the best health care in the world, treat a vulnerable and significant population of its citizens.

Stay close to your mother, you'll be safe!"" Stiller writes. ""I turned around and it was Robin. For a 13 year old who was a huge 'Mork & Mindy' fan, it was sort of like the end of the world. I never forgot it.Robin Williams: Fears of a Clown""So working with him years later I always had this little voice inside of me going 'You are acting with Robin Williams! This is the coolest thing ever!'"" he continues. ""I never got over being a fan. I think most people my age have the same feeling – that he and Steve Martin and Bill Murray sort of represented what it meant to be funny.""Peter Travers on 9 of His Favorite Robin Williams PerformancesBut beyond Williams' abilities to make people laugh, Stiller writes that he'll always remember his heart, which, like the man itself, was larger than life. Robin Williams’ 13 Funniest Impressions""His kindness and generosity is what I think of. How kind he was to anyone who wanted to connect with him. And he could not help but be funny all the time. He would do something as long as it would keep you laughing,"" he writes. ""He made many, many film crews laugh out loud before the audiences ever saw it. He made such a big impact on the world. So there is the man, and his talent and I think in his case both were extraordinary."""

Without that documentation, their health insurance plans will be rescinded Sept. 30. The recipients of these letters are people who have not responded to five to seven previous attempts to obtain their documents, according to a press release from the agency.""We want as many consumers as possible to remain enrolled in marketplace coverage, so we are giving these individuals a last chance to submit their documents before their coverage through the marketplace will end,"" Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in the press release. Discrepancies in an individual's application does not necessarily mean that person is ineligible for coverage, the press release notes.The 310,000 people being contacted represent only a small fraction of the more than 8 million individuals who have enrolled in private coverage via the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges. Nonetheless, this effort by the administration underscores the challenges left from Obamacare's troubled first open enrollment period, which began last October for benefits that took effect this year. Since the sign-ups in that six-month period ended, the Department of Health and Human Services has been working to reconcile problems with more than 2 million enrollees, including questions about the income they reported to qualify for subsidies and about their immigration status or citizenship.Undocumented immigrants are barred from receiving subsidies under the Affordable Care Act or even using their own money to purchase health insurance on the exchanges. Immigrants who are legal residents or have become naturalized citizens can do both.Initially, there were questions related to the citizenship or legal residency of some 970,000 individuals who applied for Obamacare subsidies, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. To date, the issues with 450,000 applicants have been resolved and another 210,000 are in process, the agency reported. These issues are specific to applications made through the federally run exchanges in 36 states, not the exchanges operated by the states themselves. The largest number of letters are going to Florida, where 93,800 people haven't replied to prior requests by mail, phone or email, according to the agency. The next two states on the list are Texas, with 52,700 people affected, and Georgia, with 20,900.Even after the letters are sent, federal authorities will try to make contact with these enrollees three more times before their benefits are canceled, an HHS official said on condition of anonymity. To help people document their eligibility for benefits, the federal government also is enlisting the aid of community-based organizations that provided application assistance during the enrollment period, Tavenner said in the press release.
