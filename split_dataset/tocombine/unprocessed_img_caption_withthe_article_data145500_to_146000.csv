Guarnaschelli is one of only a handful of chefs that have ever appeared on the podcast, which actually seems kind of crazy since Maron is completely obsessed with food and cooking. If you didn't know that before, either from listening to the podcast or from his appearance as The Angry Chef in Saveur, you'll definitely know it after hearing this episode. Maron and Guarnaschelli get pretty rhapsodical about how they both learned to love to eat and cook (Maron himself worked in kitchens for a while and likes to think he may have become a chef in another life). We also get to learn some amazing stuff about the Iron Chef, who grew up in New York City, got a BA in Art History from Barnard and, of course, get to hear her be characteristically enthusiastic about the searing of meat. Our favorite part was Guarnaschelli's advice on becoming a chef: ""Just pick a thing and be it.""Check out this clip about how tough the 'Iron Chef' process can really be.We really can't recommend enough that you go listen to the full podcast episode on WTF.com. We're pretty geeky for the show when comedians are on, but Maron really seems to fall into a particularly pleasant and inquisitive groove when he has a chef as a guest. Marc, we're not saying you missed your calling, but we really hope you keep talking to food people. Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "
2,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking Tips: These Ingredients Will Make Meals Taste Better (PHOTOS),Rebecca Orchant,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-tips_us_5b9d7332e4b03a1dcc8824b2,"Simple, immediate and usually not more expensive than what you're already using.",2013-08-21,After all it is only 6 weeks until Shrove Tuesday / Pancake Day,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d73322000003100fdf842.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everyone is looking for the simple things they can do to make their cooking as good as it can be, us included. For the most part, the cooking tips that make the biggest difference are practice-based: confidence in the kitchen, knife skills, sense memory. But those things take time, and sometimes what we're looking for is a quick trick that will help immediately. We've got ten of them for you today. The quickest way to eating better tasting food is to use better ingredients. But which ones? And what does better really mean? Does it mean you have to drop a whole paycheck at the grocery store? No way, dudes. No way. We've got 10 simple ingredients that will make you a better cook, asap. 1. Good Olive Oil  You know what cheap olive oil tastes like? Oil. You know what good olive oil tastes like? Olives, flowers, sunshine.Good olive oil doesn't have to be insanely expensive. In fact, we don't even use the ultra-expensive stuff. What you want is something somewhere in between that can still do the heavy lifting of sautéing and marinating, but also tastes good as a finishing drizzle over soups, vegetables, pasta dishes etc. What we're really into right now: California Olive Ranch's Everyday California Extra Virgin Olive Oil.2. Good Butter  Good, European style butter will make everything from pancakes to grilled cheese to plain old bread and butter taste even better. Usually, the more yellow the butter, the better it will taste, because cow's milk turns yellow when the cows have been grazing on grass. Which is what you want. Good butter is usually a little bit more expensive than the regular stuff, but it's totally worth it. What we're really into right now: Kerrygold, Plugra and Celles Sur Belle for special occasions.3. Kosher Salt  There is one simple, true answer to why we prefer kosher salt: it's easier to work with. The big salt crystals make it easier to pick up, control and also melt slower for more even seasoning. Some of us swear we can detect the iodine in table salt, but we'll leave that up to you. Also, table salt is still best for baking since it disperses better. The best news is: it's not expensive, so free upgrade. What we're really into right now (and forever and ever): Morton's Kosher Salt.4. Fresh Black Pepper  The powdery, pre-ground stuff in a tin box is stale and gross. Let's all admit that. Buy some whole black peppercorns from a place that specializes in spices. Then get yourself a sturdy pepper-grinder and introduce them. Then you'll realize why nearly every recipe calls for salt AND pepper. In fact, even buying peppercorns in a grinder at the supermarket will be better than pre-ground.5. Fresh Herbs  Fresh herbs will make your food taste better almost immediately. Dried herbs have their place, but ground up, dried basil leaves will never compare to the taste of the fresh ones. Same goes for parsley, oregano, thyme, almost everything. Fresh herbs are often less expensive than dried ones, and you never have to worry that they've been sitting in the cabinet for three years. 6. Good Vinegars  Just like olive oil, the difference between good vinegar and the generic stuff is pretty staggering. This is especially true when talking about red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar and balsamic vinegar. Your caprese salads are going to thank you. What we're really into right now: Fini Balsamic Vinegar, Pedro Romero Prestige Reserva Sherry Vinegar.7. Dried Beans  Don't run away. We're not saying you should be using dried beans every single time you want to make chili or a burrito. But, when you're making a bean salad, a pot of beans and greens, minestrone, etc., taking the time to coax deliciousness out of dried beans is an incredibly good use of your time. As an added bonus, dried beans are usually WAY cheaper than their canned counterparts. Here's how we work with dried beans.8. Fresh Citrus/Zest  Please, please, please hear us say this: the stuff in a bottle isn't the same as the real thing. Even the best orange juice from a bottle won't taste the same as the juice straight from the fruit. Plus, with fresh citrus, you get the added bonus of being able to use the citrus zest, which imparts the fruit's natural oils into every ounce of your dish. 9. Real Parmesan/Parmigiano-Reggiano  NO.  NO.  YES.10. Homemade Stock  Not only do you get to be in control of the exact flavors, aromas, salt-level and ingredients, making stock at home is also a great way to use up leftover vegetable and kitchen scraps. Here's how we make our own stock -- we promise it's worth it.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "
3,STYLE & BEAUTY,Disturbing Photo Shows South Korean Plastic Surgery For Permanent Smile?,Amanda Scherker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-korean-plastic-surgery-smile_us_5b9d731ce4b03a1dcc88224a,"South Korea has become the world leader in per-capita plastic surgery, according to data from the International Society of",2013-08-21, Heidi Montag's Plastic Surgery Prevented Her From Hugging,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf10fe180000dd10bcd11e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Earlier this week a bizarre photo hit Reddit, purportedly showing the results of a new plastic surgery trend. The user claimed the girl in the picture had undergone a ""new plastic surgery in Asia that curls the corners of your lips."" While the authenticity of the photo hasn't been confirmed, the surgery appears to be a real thing. As pointed out by Business Insider, the AONE clinic in South Korea is responsible for the procedure, which gives the patient the appearance of a permanent smile. Dr. Kwon Taek Keun, the clinic's founder, spoke about the ""mouth corner lift"" surgery in 2012 at a yearly international convention for plastic surgeons. Here's how he described the results of the procedure on the conference's website: ""Mouth corners lift up very naturally after surgery, and although mouth corners stay upturned on an impassive face, they lift up even more distinctively during a smile."" AONE's YouTube video (seen above) details the surgery, dubbed the ""smile lipt"" (a combination of the words ""lift"" and ""lip""), and its presumed benefits. The footage is also full of terrifying before-and-after pictures.South Korea has become the world leader in per-capita plastic surgery, according to data from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. The data estimates 20 percent of South Korean women have gone under the knife in this quest for finer features.While eyelid surgery and nose jobs are common, more controversial and dangerous surgeries have grown in popularity. Recently, the double jaw surgery became popular in South Korea. The surgery is supposed to create a delicate ""V-shaped"" chin and jawline, but 52 percent of such surgeries also result in facial numbness and the inability to chew and swallow.When plastic surgery goes wrong:Want more?

The Michelin Red Guide to restaurants ranks on a system of one to three stars, and in North America is located in the cities of San Francisco, New York, and Chicago -- with only around ten restaurants in the United States earning the highest three-star honor yearly.But with the rise of the crowdsourcing trend, users are increasingly turning to review sites such as Yelp for restaurant reviews. This user-generated content is not only a source for restaurant seekers, but it has also become the most significant platform for amateur restaurant reviewers.Considering the major differences in the Michelin Red Guide and Yelp reviewing systems, it is no surprise that the professional high-brow guide and the voice of the people sometimes disagree. This is perhaps most obvious when some of the most widely esteemed restaurants in the world receive negative Yelp reviews. By negative, we mean really negative -- one star out of five, usually accompanied by scathing commentary.Are these Yelp reviewers warranted in their disgust with corkage fees, dress codes, and Japanese fusion?

Scientists who sparked an outcry by creating easier-to-spread versions of the bird flu want to try such experiments again using a worrisome new strain. Since it broke out in China in March, the H7N9 bird flu has infected more than 130 people and killed 43. Leading flu researchers say that genetically engineering this virus in the lab could help track whether it?s changing in the wild to become a bigger threat. They announced the pending plans Wednesday in letters to the journals Science and Nature. (AP Photo/Takeshi Noda/University of Tokyo, Science)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d740524000031005398eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate KellandLONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - A deadly new bird flu virus in China evolved from migratory birds via waterfowl to poultry and into people, and there are other bird flu viruses circulating that could follow the same path, scientists have found.The study - an analysis of the evolutionary history of the H7N9 bird flu that has so far killed 44 people - identified several other H7 flu viruses circulating in birds that the researchers said ""may pose threats beyond the current outbreak"".While none of the additional H7 strains they detected has yet been found in humans, some are able to infect other mammals such as ferrets, the researchers said, suggesting a jump to humans may be possible.""The discovery ... reminds us that even if H7N9 does not return, there are risks lurking amongst the great diversity of avian influenza viruses,"" said Peter Horby, a bird flu expert at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Hanoi, Vietnam, who was not involved in the research.H7N9 bird flu, which was unknown in humans until February, has so far infected at least 135 people in China and Taiwan, killing 44 of them, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data.Most cases have been in people who had visited live poultry markets or had close contact with live poultry.In recent weeks the number of new infections in people has dropped dramatically, thanks largely, experts say, to the closure by Chinese authorities of many live poultry markets and the summer season. But many virologists fear the human case rate may pick up again with the return of autumn and winter in China.To trace the evolution of H7N9 and its path into humans, researchers led by Maria Huachen Zhu and Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong conducted field surveillance around the main H7N9 outbreak region and mapped out, or sequenced, genetic codes of a large number of bird flu viruses they found.Reporting their findings in the journal Nature on Wednesday, they concluded that H7 viruses probably transferred from ducks to chickens on at least two independent occasions and that a so-called ""reassortment"" of these viruses with others called H9N2 eventually generated the H7N9 outbreak virus.They also found another previously unrecognised H7N7 virus strain had emerged and is circulating in poultry in China.In experiments testing this strain, they discovered it has the ability to infect ferrets - an animal model often used by scientists to find out more about what flu might do in humans - suggesting it could jump into people in future.Flu experts praised the research, with Horby describing it as using the kind of ""microbial forensics"" essential for helping scientists piece together where new bird flu viruses come from and what other threats might be out there.Ian Jones, a virologist at Britain's University of Reading, said the discovery of other H7 bird flu strains was interesting but stressed they were ""not of immediate public concern"".""The study identifies the route of adaptation (for H7N9) from migratory birds to local waterfowl to poultry in live markets and then to people,"" he said.""Surveillance programmes can now focus on key strains in the adaption process and eradicate them before they complete the jump to people.""

Nonni's THINaddictives cookies: These light and crunchy biscotti are available with fruit and nuts and the individual packages are perfect for snacking.   2. Justin's peanut butter cups: My weakness! I adore these peanut butter cups, especially the dark chocolate ones. I like the one pack serving size because if there are two in a pack, I will eat both.   3. Snack sized ziplock bags filled with nuts and dried fruit: I particularly like almonds, walnuts and pistachios with dried cherries and dried fruit like mango, but apple and papaya are good too.   4. Mini Babybel cheese: These little cheese rounds can last without refrigeration for at least two to four hours, which works just fine for me. They're not exactly gourmet, but tasty, very convenient and not messy. SEE MORE: The Best Bagels in America   5. Gary West beef jerky: Another food I only eat on trips.

The fruit and nut combinations are actually very good and there isn't a lot of junk in them.  7. Bagel and cream cheese: I sometimes buy a bagel and cream cheese at the airport. It's filling and generally reasonably priced.   8. Stretch Island fruit leather: Fresh fruit can be incredibly messy! I wouldn't normally eat this kind of thing, but it's very convenient for travel.   9. Wild Garden hummus and chips: Not sure how I discovered these, but the combo packet of chips and hummus can definitely tide me over when I am missing a meal. What do you take on the plane?
