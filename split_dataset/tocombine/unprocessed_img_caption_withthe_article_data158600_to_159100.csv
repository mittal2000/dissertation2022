The expansion in public prekindergarten programs has slowed and even been reversed in some states as school districts cope with shrinking budgets. As a result, many 3- and 4-year-olds aren't going to preschool.

But today, a family's income has everything to do with whether children succeed. President Barack Obama's proposal to make high-quality pre-K more affordable and more available can give all kids the chance to reach their potential.By age 5, just 48 percent of poor children in America are ready for school, compared to three-fourths of children from families with moderate and high incomes. Most schools will struggle to help children from low-income families catch up to children from more affluent households. Byt third grade, 80 percent of low-income children are not proficient in reading.Once kids fall behind, the research shows they're much less likely to catch up. A student from a poor family who cannot read on grade level by third grade is 13 times less likely to graduate from high school.The reason is obvious: Money matters. Families with higher incomes have many advantages. One important advantage is the ability to afford quality early childhood education. The National Institute for Early Education Research estimated last year that approximately 9 out of 10 children in households with incomes in the top 20 percent send their children to pre-K. Some families take advantage of publicly-funded programs, but if they are not available they have the means to pay for it on their own. In fact, the vast majority of higher income families pay to send their children to private pre-K, where they receive instruction focused on developing the cognitive, social and emotional skills kids need to enter kindergarten ready to learn.However, one year of privately-funded pre-K costs about as much as one year of college tuition at a public university. So it's no surprise that just 7 percent of children in households with incomes in the bottom 20 percent send their children to private pre-K. While many children in low-income families attend Head Start or other publicly-funded pre-K, these programs don't have the funding they need to serve all the children who qualify, so when it's not available, these kids are left behind. Children in middle income families also feel the impact. Their families' incomes are too high to qualify for Head Start, but nowhere near enough to cover the high cost of private pre-K. As a result, just under half of middle-income children attend publicly-subsidized pre-K other than Head Start -- usually financed through individual states or school districts. But these opportunities don't have the funding they need either, so many of these children are also left behind. Beyond the children and families directly affected, these inequities in opportunity hurt all of us. They strain our public education system, making K-12 education more about helping kids who are behind catch up than challenging all students to pursue academic excellence. And, when kids fail to reach their potential, the result is lower lifelong productivity and higher taxpayer costs for law enforcement, health care, and welfare.The President has proposed a bold plan to build an early childhood education system that lives up to the core American ideal that a child's future should not be decided by the circumstances of his or her birth.We welcome and encourage a vigorous debate over how to get there. However, solving this problem boils down to two relatively straightforward requirements. We must make pre-K more affordable and, thereby, more available. High-quality early education doesn't matter if it doesn't reach the kids who need it most, including the middle-income kids who are left out. We must also ensure the quality of pre-K educational opportunities so all kids get the most educational benefit and taxpayers get real value for their dollar.We can no longer ignore the evidence that some of the most important learning takes place in the years before kindergarten. That expensive delusion has already cost children and taxpayers too much.A 21st century education system must be built on the solid foundation provided by high-quality early childhood education for every child. Laying that foundation is not just an economic imperative -- it is also about providing every child in this country a fair and equal opportunity to achieve their God-given potential."

I know I used to!You see, It was just a couple of years ago that I decided to ""get with the program"" and made it a priority to feed my family quality, nutritional food. There seems to be lots of dinner recipes out on the web; but when it came to lunch packing and tips on how to reuse dinner for lunch... well, there aren't that many. For this reason, I each week I incorporate ways to plan ahead and use up leftovers in the MOMables menus. My subscribers tell me that they are tying new recipes into their meal rotation and are feeling more comfortable with their kitchen skills. I am thrilled that people are eating better and a wider variety of foods, but I can't help but feel like I should incorporate leftovers more, considering how much food is being thrown away each day. Let me give you an example of what happened prior to planning my meals. I'd buy a bag of potatoes at the grocery store for one soup recipe and then a week later my potatoes were going bad! Add another week to that ... and they would go straight into the trash. What a waste!One day, I thought to myself: I have taken major steps in the right direction with cooking, but now I need to find ways to be less wasteful. What if in addition to the three potatoes I boiled for my soup, I added three more and made mashed potatoes the next night?I started to plan this way and utilized one ingredient in 2-3 recipes. Not only did this cut down on waste, but it also saved me time and money.Now, I pack three school lunches and two adult office lunches daily. It only makes sense to apply these same principles of ""re-purposing"" food for his lunches, right? Of course.A great perk to re-purposing food for lunch is that you don't need a lot of leftovers to make it into ""something."" The leftovers that you would normally pitch, because it just didn't seem like enough to justify keeping, could be just the right amount for a kid's lunch.I'll give you another example. Let's say one night you make a grilled pork loin with seared plums, and a baked sweet potato on the side. Use your leftover sweet potatoes to make black bean and sweet potato burritos. Or, you could make our sweet potato hummus and send it with pitas for lunch!We all love this vegetarian lunch option because of the delicious combination of flavors from the sweet potatoes, black beans, roasted vegetables, spices and fresh herbs -- except my 5-year-old, who likes his burrito without the peppers. Black Bean & Sweet Potato Burritos Recipe Courtesy MOMables Menus Yields 2 BurritosIngredients: • 1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed small • 1/3 jalapeno, seeded and finely diced • 1/3 red pepper, diced small • 1/3 small red onion, diced small • 1/2 teaspoon olive oil • 1/2 teaspoon cumin • 1/2 teaspoon chili powder • 1/8 teaspoon salt • 1/8 teaspoon black pepper • 1/3 cup black beans, rinsed and drain • 2-3 T chopped cilantro • 1/2 teaspoon fresh lime juice • 1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese • 1/3 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese • 2 burrito-size tortillasDirections: 1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss together the sweet potatoes, jalapeno, red pepper and red onion with the olive oil, cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. Dump the coated veggies onto a large rimmed baking sheet and roast for 18-20 minutes, tossing halfway through. The vegetables should be tender but not mushy at the end of cooking time.2. Let the vegetable mixture cool. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl and toss with the black beans, cilantro and lime juice. Taste the mixture and add additional salt and pepper to taste, if needed. Refrigerate the mixture until ready to assemble the burritos or use immediately.3. Place 3-4 tortillas on a microwave-safe plat and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave for 15-20 seconds until the tortillas are pliable. Place 1/4 cup or so of the vegetable mixture in the center of the tortilla and top with a sprinkle with shredded cheese, a little of each kind.. Fold in the sides of the tortilla and roll up. Place seam-side down on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tortillas until you have all the burritos you need (the filling can be refrigerated and used for 3-4 days).4. Bake in a 375 degree F oven for about 10-15 minutes, until heated through and the top of the tortilla is golden brown. Adjust the baking time as needed depending on if the filling has been refrigerated or not. For a softer tortilla, wrap each burrito in tin foil and heat through. Serve immediately."

Sure, green asparagus is lovely, but there's just something that feels extra luxurious about the texture and flavor of white asparagus.White asparagus is related to the classic green version, but because it's grown underground and protected from sunlight, chlorophyll never forms (now do you get the vampire reference?). That's what makes it white, and that's also what makes its stalks so tender. Treated with nearly the same feverish excitement as other prized spring produce like ramps, fiddleheads and morels, white asparagus gets bought up quickly by chefs and excitable home cooks alike. The season is fleeting, so be sure to enjoy it while it lasts. These recipes will help you do just that."

Brown/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d029c26000035007fb38c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last month, Jenna Wolfe, correspondent for The Today Show, revealed that she is pregnant with a baby girl due in August. She gushed and glowed as any expectant mother is wont to do as she delivered her good news on the cream-colored couch to Savannah and Matt during a morning segment. Her aim was to get word out just in front of a People magazine article, which was to follow less than a week later.Sure, a pregnancy by someone who wants a baby is good news. But what made this announcement news news?The part that made her tidings remarkable -- but not really -- was the additional revelation that the baby's other parent is Jenna's girlfriend, NBC's foreign correspondent Stephanie Gosk.The mothers-to-be must have been gratified by how well the news was received by their friends and colleagues.We have come a long way in how we think about love and relationships, haven't we?But we still have a ways to goI barely glanced up at the TV screen the day of Jenna's big reveal. People who have suffered infertility tend to tune out pregnancy announcements when possible. I'm happy for her, for Jenna. I just don't have it in me to look at her fecund belly if I don't have to.So that was that, I thought. I didn't expect for People magazine to find me. But it did one day at the gym when I decided to get on the elliptical and had forgotten my Kindle.I admit it. I was curious how Jenna and Stephanie had manifested their pregnancy, though I had a pretty good idea. My curiosity, as a mom who does not share DNA with the children she parents, was less about the details and more about how the women were emotionally approaching their choice to use a sperm donor.Jenna tells People they chose an anonymous donor because, ""We want the child to be raised with two parents and never the question of 'Is there a third?' ""I wasn't surprised by their desire to not want to deal with the fact that a third person exists who is connected to their daughter. New acquaintances of mine are often mystified that my husband and I sought to have a relationship with our two children's birth parents. We are in contact with all four of them in varying degrees based on distance, logistics and their desires. I knew the moment I became a mom that denying the people who created my daughter would not negate their existence, would not automatically and thoroughly edit them out of my children's life histories. Tessa's birth dad is right there in the steel of her will, her birth mom in her innate fashion sense. Reed's birth mom is evident in the shape of his eyes, his birth dad in his curiosity about how things are built.In the moments of their adoption -- like the moment of Jenna's baby's conception -- a split was created in our children between their biology and their biography. Being open about our children's origins is an effective way to heal this split and help them integrate their identities. Instead of hoping our children would never question their heritage, we assumed they would so we drew a wider circle for our family, bringing close more people to claim our children and more people for our children to claim -- birth parents, birth siblings, birth grandparents and other family members. You might say our family is hyper-extended.I suggest that Jenna and Stephanie, in an early act of enlightened parenting, switch from the old either/or paradigm -- either you are the parents OR another person has a claim -- to the more inclusive both/and mindset: Your daughter gets half her biology from a man whose sperm you chose AND she gets her biography from her two moms. In doing so, you as parents are not subtracted from; your daughter is added to. To deny the existence of a man who is crucial to your daughter's existence is akin to denying your daughter part of herself.While we evolve in the ways we think about love, relationships and the right to love the person you want to, let's also be mindful to evolve when it comes to love, relationships and the right of a person to know and integrate her identity."

AUGUST 04: Detailed view of the bottle of Legacy by Angostura, the most expensive rum made in the Caribbean, during a charity gala at Hyatt Regency Trinidad, on August 04, 2012, in Port Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Legacy is a limited edition sipping rum designed in honor of the 50th Independence celebration of Trinidad and Tobago. (Photo by Sean Drakes/LatinContent/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d00cd2000003100fdcc1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was a Wednesday afternoon. I was taking care of my two-year-old daughter when the phone rang. It was my friend, publicist James Monahan. ""How are you, my friend? ""Cut to the chase, pal,"" I said tersely. ""The kid doesn't like it when Daddy talks on the phone."" Over her shouting and the gripping dialogue of her favorite cartoon, Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, I caught only a few snippets of what James was saying. But it was enough. ""Angostura... rum... expensive... limited edition... dinner...."" But the snippet that most caught my ear and captured my imagination was this: ""$25,000."" Now, it wasn't just that I was intrigued by the thought of drinking something that costs 1,000 times as much as an average bottle of dark sipping rum -- although of course I wasn't about to turn down such an opportunity. No, this audacious, downright ballsy product launch could represent a sea change in how rum is presented and marketed, and with any luck how it's perceived as well. Single malt Scotch whiskies that sell for thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars are... well, not a dime a dozen obviously. But they're becoming more commonplace with each passing year. Along with cognac, single malts are the status symbols of the spirits world. So what's Scotch got that rum -- namely Legacy by Angostura, as their new $25,000 super-limited edition is called -- hasn't got? After all, a really good aged sipping rum is as complex and delicious and mind-blowing as any whisky or cognac. And if there's a brand that can take rum to the next level of snob appeal, it's Angostura. They're better known for their legendary bitters, but they've also been making the best rums in Trinidad, and some of the best anywhere in the Caribbean, since the 1940s. Angostura makes rums both for mixing and for sipping, but the flavor profile -- rich, ultra-smooth, with gobs of vanilla, toffee, honey, and varying degrees of oak depending on how long it's aged -- remains constant throughout the range. My favorite is the 12-year-old ""1824"" bottling, with spice and oak notes combining with the sweet flavors to form a more perfect union in your mouth. It's soothing and challenging at the same time -- and at $55, it's very reasonable compared to more glamorous top-of-the-line whiskies.In fact, with precious few exceptions, ultra-premium rums simply don't compare, price-wise, with their single-malt counterparts. If you're into rum, of course, that's a great thing. But it also means that the marketplace perceives rum to be a lot less valuable than single malt whisky. It seems to me there are two reasons why. First, a lot of would-be connoisseurs whose disposable income exceeds their knowledge of spirits aren't buying a bottle of booze so much as they're buying an age statement. And the older the age, the sexier the contents of the bottle, regardless of what they taste like. Scotland's cool and damp climate allows for aging whiskies as long as 30, 40, 50 years or more. Rum, on the other hand, is aged in tropical climes that speed up the aging process, making a bottle of 10-year-old rum the equivalent of a single malt that's two or three times as old. And 10... well, it's just not as sexy as 18 or 21 or 30.Then there's the Bacardi Factor. A single malt whisky, whether it's $30 or $300 or $30,000, beings to mind the same things -- class, sophistication, luxury. And rum? Yeah, it's that clear stuff you put in your mojitos and frozen strawberry daiquiris, or you can drink it with Diet Coke if you're low-carbing. Right?Well, Legacy by Angostura, the self-proclaimed ""World's Most Expensive Rum,"" is here to put lie to that myth. With a blend of rums aged a minimum of 17 years in once-used American bourbon oak casks, housed in an Asprey crystal decanter with a gorgeous sculpted silver stopper, limited to a minuscule 20 bottles worldwide (a mere three in the U.S.), the good folks at Angostura are pulling out all the stops with this one. Angostura's Master Distiller, John Georges, is being flown around the globe to launch Legacy and sing the praises of Angostura in general. Which is why I found myself with a small group of journalists at a swanky Upper East Side restaurant, sitting across from Mr. Georges and geeking out about the finer details of rum distillation with him while sipping our way through Angostura's line. When our glasses of Legacy -- valued, by my reckoning, at more than $1,000 each -- were brought out, Georges was less loquacious than he'd been throughout the evening. Perhaps even a little overwhelmed. He and the other distillers and blenders at Angostura had worked for six years, he said, using some of Angostura's rarest rums, and he believed the end result was truly the greatest sipping rum ever made. I can't quote him exactly because I was too busy staring at my ounce or so of Legacy trying to figure out how much each drop was worth. Does it taste like a $25,000 rum? Well, I'm not exactly the target audience, meaning that I look at 25 grand as, you know, money to live on for a good chunk of time. If Mariano Rivera was there to personally pour it for me while Christina Hendricks rubbed my shoulders, possibly. But Legacy is more than just a bold and audacious marketing move. I'll tell you, this rum has ... gravitas. It's big, profound, monumental, but not without a touch of lightness and a twinkle in its proverbial eye. For some reason, the image of Winston Churchill popped into my head while I took my first sip. It's recognizably Angostura, with those distinctive vanilla and honey notes, but it's deeper and richer, with more spice and wood, notes of dark fruit and nuts, and a long, oaky finish. And having been lucky enough to taste a few five-figure whiskies, I'll assert that Legacy can stand proudly alongside the best of them. If there's one rum that can change people's perceptions about what rum is, and what it can be at its best, this is as good a candidate as any. I guess the real question is, can any one rum accomplish the monumental task of overcoming the Bacardi Factor? Perhaps not, but this is an impressive opening salvo. Remember, twenty years ago tequila suffered from the same perception -- the Cuervo Factor, if you will. Today, in addition to the margaritas-and-body-shots crowd, there's a large and growing market for ultra-premium sipping tequilas, with increasing demand to go along with improved quality. It wasn't achieved overnight, with one limited edition bottling, but it did happen. I'm guessing the same will hold true for rum over the next several years. It's been an ""on the brink"" spirit for ages, but its breakthrough may finally be nigh. And hopefully Legacy will help open minds as much as it opens wallets."

It was midnight and a pack of hyenas had ventured from their nocturnal homes to ours. The only thing between us and them was a thin sheet of canvas. The ill-reputed scavengers of the Serengeti had surrounded our tent pitched in the heart of the savannah. My confidence with the wild animals had grown after watching our guide laugh them away earlier that evening after dinner. I unzipped the tent with just enough room to shine my flashlight only to gaze upon a sea of glowing eyes. I slowly stepped outside and began to set up my tripod to photograph the night sky. The flashlight kept the seemingly dangerous predators at bay. The sea of eyes transitioned upwards as my attention turned to the beautiful night sky. The moment that I realized I was surrounded by hyenas in the middle of the Serengeti I thought to myself, this was the Africa I came to experience. Energized by the encounter and unable to put my mind to rest made falling back to sleep challenging that night. We awoke hours later just in time watch the sun creep over the horizon of the African plains. Not even the animals had risen from their deep slumbers. The predawn light from the Tanzanian skies filled the grasslands with a soft red glow as we filled our canteens preparing for the morning adventure.We departed on our pre-dawn game drive ahead of the sun and just minutes later we spotted a lioness sleeping just a few paces off the main trail. I should say Othman, our Tanzanian safari guide, and not me, had spotted her because spotting animals during the day was an art form. Spotting them before the morning light had broken, well that made him the master. Othman had been a safari guide for roughly seven years and had attended years of safari guide school to earn a degree for his profession. He was from Arusha, the first stop for anyone looking to spot the big five, which include the lion, leopard, rhino, Cape buffalo and elephant, in Northern Tanzania. Othman was our eyes and ears for eight days as he navigated the vast lands of the Serengeti. Without him we would have been lost.The morning of our late night visit from the hyenas Othman had suggested that we awake at 4:30AM for an early game drive. This was his best suggestion yet. We didn't see another safari truck or human for hours. It was just the picturesque savannah, the animals, and us. When Othman spotted the golden lioness that morning, he stopped the vehicle, and we just watched her. She was sleeping undisturbed as the glowing African sun slowly crept over the Maasai rocks in the distance. As the sun rose so did she and she stretched and gazed over the pride lands. This was her home and we were just passing through. Observing the animals in their natural habitat was unlike anything I had ever experienced. We came across elephants showering themselves in the mid-day sun, leopards carrying their kill high into the trees, and we even intruded on a couple of lions on their honeymoon. Always trying to remain respectful and preserving the healthy relationship the animals have with us onlookers. It was our last day on safari, it was everything I could've asked for. The Serengeti is a vast sea of diversity and I could see why my guide loved his job. Some day I will return to Tanzania but until that day I can only dream of Africa.
