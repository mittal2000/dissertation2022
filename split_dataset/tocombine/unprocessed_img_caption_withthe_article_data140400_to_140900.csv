But I have to constantly rotate my collection and move pieces around along with my décor and furniture for the art to harmonize with my house.",2013-10-15,2013-10-14-MariaBrito_RotatingArtCollectionHuffingtonPost.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-14-MariaBrito_RotatingArtCollectionHuffingtonPost.jpg,"Same space, three different styles based on the art.A few days ago I wondered, prompted by a friend's question, if I was an art hoarder more than an art collector. Well, my answer is that, basically, I'm out of walls in my apartment, and if that makes me a hoarder, then I am one. But I have to constantly rotate my collection and move pieces around along with my décor and furniture for the art to harmonize with my house and to be displayed in a way that enhances the collection and the space itself rather than bringing the whole thing down.I recently acquired an LED and mirror electrical drum sculpture by Chilean artist, Ivan Navarro. I knew I needed to change things around and find the best space for it based on the following criteria: 1) proximity of an electrical outlet (the piece has to be plugged-in to show its ""infinite tunnel"" effect); 2) the piece required to be alone in a column or a small wall since, due to its size, placing it in a large wall could run the risk of diluting it; 3) last but not least, it also needed be installed at eye level, since the whole point of Ivan's pieces are to engage viewer interaction to peer into the illusionary abyss created in his sculptures.After the drum was installed on the wall, I had to change almost everything that surrounded it. It was then that I noticed that this corner in my house has gone through several transformations, all driven by the art on the walls. The predecessors of this installation were: a self-portrait of Argentinean artist Flavia da Rin from the ""Girl with Fairies"" series created in a round format mounted in Plexiglas accompanied by stacks of art books -- which are the only constant in the reinventions -- and a Jonathan Adler pottery horse. That vignette was followed by a much-too-much combo integrated by a Ruud van Empel c-print, which was placed next to three mixed-media, wood-framed brown bags from Mark Bradford's ""Can You Feel It?"" series, plus kitschy Alexander Girard wood dolls and an Indian rope anteater (this was really a lot.) The latest and somewhat simpler installation has Ivan's drum plus a perpendicularly-placed wood framed edgy photograph by Assume Vivid Astro Focus. Only the art books on top of the demi-lune table remain because everything else was bringing the whole thing down. Even as a hoarder, one must know when to edit and when to stop."

(AP Photo/Molly Riley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d99232100003100c59675.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Researchers will spend $25 million in federal funds over the next five years assessing the effectiveness and ethical implications of making genetic testing of newborns a new delivery room standard.Launched by the National Institutes of Health last month, the study will be divided into four projects at the University of California, San Francisco, Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Mass., Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Should genetic testing become standard, it will build upon routine blood testing of newborns. The blood testing was introduced in the 1960s as a way for parents to learn if their infants have any conditions that can be banished if treated early on, including several developmental delays.But the answers held in blood testing are limited, say researchers, and there is a higher possibility for false positives.“Genomic sequencing has the potential to diagnose a vast array of disorders and conditions at the very start of life,” Alan E. Guttmacher, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said in a press release. But he also emphasized the importance of weighing the moral implications of letting parents in on conditions their children might develop later in life.“The ability to decipher an individual’s genetic code rapidly also brings with it a host of clinical and ethical issues, which is why it is important that this program explores the trio of technical, clinical and ethical aspects of genomics research in the newborn period,” he said. Some scientists worry such early health forecasts, especially for untreatable or unpreventable conditions, might negatively influence how children are parented.“I think there’s actually greater harm than good to be telling parents that a child has a three- or four-fold increased risk for a late-onset disorder for which we currently have no therapy,” UCSF geneticist Bob Nussbaum told KQED, citing Alzheimer’s disease as an example.Nussbaum cautioned that parents of children flagged for later health risks “are perhaps afraid to institute the same level of discipline. They may treat one of those children differently than the siblings. You’ve introduced a psychological issue.”To evaluate the ethics in genetic testing, bioethicists will evaluate participating parents’ willingness to be informed of health risks their children are likely to face later in life.Study participant Holly Sloan, a nurse in Virginia, told the Star Tribune that the possibility of implementing effective lifestyle changes for her daughter early on made the study worth the risks.""If it was something that we could hopefully prevent through diet or exercise or some kind of lifestyle change, we could start with that as early as possible,"" she said. ""I guess I'm just the type of person, I would rather know and address it."" Parents already have the opportunity to have genetic tests done through private companies. 23andMe employee Catherine Afarian purchased one of the DNA-analysis company’s tests for her son, and discovered he had an increased risk for Parkinson’s Disease. With that knowledge, she says she plans to pay special attention to Parkinson’s studies and donate money to Parkinson’s research."
2,FOOD & DRINK,The Best Kale and Why,"Epicurious, Contributor
Epicurious",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-best-kale-and-why_us_5b9d999fe4b03a1dcc8a043e,Kale is everywhere. But which kind is the best?,2013-10-15,2013-10-15-6a00d83451cb0369e2019affde8374970b800wi.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-15-6a00d83451cb0369e2019affde8374970b800wi.jpeg,"Kemp Minifie, EpicuriousJudging by the huge mounds of bushy bunches of kale in farmers' markets as well as supermarkets, this dark leafy green is still enjoying its well-deserved popularity, despite the fickle self-proclaimed arbiters of food trends who consider it passé. As my husband and I were wolfing down heaping forkfuls of spaghetti with kale and lots of golden-fried slices of garlic the other evening -- it's our favorite pasta dish and we never tire of it despite the fact that I make it every week -- he commented that as a kid he never saw kale or even heard of it. Ditto for me. It wasn't until we started frequenting the Union Square Greenmarket in New York City that we noticed it for the first time.From my perspective in the late Gourmet magazine test kitchens, kale started to appear on the radar in the mid- to late '80s and was close to mainstream by the mid-'90s. For the longest time curly kale was the only kale available. It took the explosion of interest in Italian cooking to bring Tuscan kale to American markets, and other varieties soon followed.See more: Indulgent, Delicious Breakfasts  Although I lacked enthusiasm during my early experiences with kale, I've long since become a kale cheerleader. I buy it year-round, shopping for it in the supermarket only when it's not available at the farmers market. The best and sweetest kale is the stuff that comes to market after the first couple of frosts.Although it hasn't gotten that cold yet here in New York City, I've been stocking up on the Tuscan kale from Rick Bishop's Mountain Sweet Berry Farm in Roscoe, New York, in the western Catskill area, because it is the darkest, most supple kale around at the moment. Bishop's kale is pictured at the top in the photo above. Contrast it to Tuscan kale (a.k.a. lacinato, or dinosaur kale) from a nearby upscale supermarket and you can't help but see a huge difference. So I had to ask Bishop why his kale is so outstanding.""It's about mineralizing the soil,"" he hurriedly explained as his line of customers grew. ""That's my whole shtick!"" Bishop adds compost, rock phosphate, lime, calcium phosphate, green sand, granite dust, and gypsum to his soil and sprays the crop with sea kelp and mineral solutions. ""I'm a huge believer that inputs are necessary. High input. Build that soil up. Get it healthy. It builds up the [kale] flavor, the kale grows faster, it's more succulent, and it's tasty.""Where in the world does he get these minerals? Bishop was quick to credit the Amish with genuine respect. ""Those guys are so close to the earth they know. They know their stuff."" He buys most of it from the Amish, except for lime that he gets at a local mill.See more: Your New Favorite Chicken RecipeI was curious how the Amish had become the big suppliers of minerals for soil. ""It rang a note with the Amish like 30 years ago,"" said Bishop, explaining that as some farmers started turning towards eco-agriculture, growing more for quality to feed their own animals and their customers at the farmers' markets, the Amish saw a niche and became the distributors, the buyers and sellers of mineral inputs. The minerals come from all over the country. The green sand, for instance, comes from ancient ocean deposits in New Jersey.As Bishop's customers grew more impatient with his chatty conversation with me, he wrapped it up with a big smile and a chuckle. ""I'm building the soil, making it happy and alive!""Want to feel as upbeat as Bishop's soil? These four-fork kale recipes are bound to make you feel happy and alive!

Were we living with spirits, or was there a logical explanation? 1. Something's always waking you up in the middle of the night.2. Objects such as keys, phones and remotes seem to move around or totally vanish into thin air.3. Everything is covered in some sort of sticky ectoplasm.4. Lights are always turning on and off.5. Cabinets, doors and drawers that you know were closed are found completely ajar.6. There seems to be a creepy presence lurking just beside you, and it's always there. You sense it in the bathroom while you're taking a shower, slithering about just outside the curtain. It's next to your bed while you sleep, and you don't need to open your eyes to know that it's only inches from your face, silently staring at you. Was that a disembodied hand under the bathroom door? You're not even alone when you're trying to pee.7. There's a bloody hand print running down the glass window! OK, it's not blood, it's really comprised of ketchup and juice, but it still looks gross and fairly scary.8. You hear loud thuds and bangs followed by total silence, and you're completely terrified to go see what could have been making those sounds.9. You're afraid to close your eyes for a moment -- even in the middle of the day.So, next time you hear something going bump in the night, don't be afraid.
