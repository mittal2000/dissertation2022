(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0f2e240000300094ed43.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After two decades of marriage, actress Jane Seymour and her husband, director James Keach, have decided to part ways. Seymour, a former Bond girl and star of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, has been married three times before. Keach had been married twice before. The two wed in 1993 and have 17-year-old twin sons. While neither have stated reasons for the separation, confirming only that they are living apart and negotiating a settlement, reports suggest it may have something to do with his infidelity. The Daily Mail reported that a source close to the couple said, ""James is a very charismatic man, but he's a flirt and has a wandering eye. They've been having trust issues.""Ah, trust issues. Let me first begin by saying it is always a jolt when a couple has been married for a long time and then decides to end it. It is unnerving and hard to understand why and how they prevailed for so long but didn't ultimately succeed at their union. Shouldn't marriage get easier as time goes on? Certainly by now they must have figured out how to adjust to each other's needs and make things work. This takes me back to the trust issues. Sometimes there are problems that surface early in a marriage that are simply swept under the rug. Maybe the couple tried to deal with whatever was in question, but they were busy, with new careers and perhaps with kids. Life was coming at them full throttle and they might not have had the energy or focus needed to get to the foundation of the trouble. They were probably also quite hopeful that this person they chose to spend the rest of their life with was the right choice. And they were pretty committed to proving that fact, for the sake of their lives together and for their family -- the one that might already existed or the one they dreamt about creating in the future. So they let unresolved issues go by, even excusing some questionable behavior. And thus at least momentarily they jumped the hurdle of whatever they were upset about. But if that problem was not fully resolved, to its core, it can sink deep and take root where it can smolder.Flash forward fifteen or twenty years. Imagine that those unresolved issues have been there all that time, beneath that argument they have over and over about the thermostat or keeping the car clean. In my book What About Me? Stop Selfishness From Ruining Your Relationship, I talk about The Never Ending Fight in which a couple has the same heated disagreement over and over and over. Every time it crops up it is open warfare. The years have gone by, but the issues are the same, and now each person doesn't have quite the hope or the tolerance they did at the beginning of their marriage. In addition to that, the time they have shared has only served to clarify the odds between them. It gets to the point where they have hit their last nerve, and so the marriage finally begins to crumble.It isn't funny, but it does remind me of a joke. Bessy and Sam go to see a marriage counselor after 50 years of marriage. Bessy says she wants a divorce. The marriage counselor asks her why, after all these years, is she making that decision now? And Bessy answers, ""Because enough is enough!""Sometimes enough is enough, and it takes a lot of courage to end a marriage after so many years together. One way to avoid reaching that point is to make sure those trust issues that appeared in the earlier years of your marriage don't go unchecked or ignored. Take the time then to work through them. More than anything people want to feel they are safe in their union and they can trust their spouse. But if that remains elusive, and you are truly unhappy, don't let the amount of time that you have shared hold you back from making an important change.

The consistent theme is: Don't let the monsters who did this know they hurt us. Get back to normal right away. Thomas Friedman declared, ""We don't frighten easily anymore."" The most poignant piece was an ode to Boston, ""Messing With the Wrong City,"" by Dennis Lehane. He boasted of his neighbors, ""When the authorities find the weak and terminally maladjusted culprit or culprits, we'll roll our eyes at whatever backward ideology they embrace and move on with our lives.""

Yes, the article ends, once again, on a defiant note, but in between there are the terrible gulps that one does to try and hold back tears, often unsuccessfully.So let's admit we are hurting, at least at first, at least for a little while. Just because we really are. Although I've lived in California for more than two decades, I'm still a New Yorker at heart. On the day after 9/11, my university's health service sent faculty a checklist of stress symptoms to look for in our students. As I started reading the email I said to myself right away, ""I've got that one. And that one. And that one."" All the way down. Although I tried mightily, I'm not sure how much use I was to my students. Within the week, my wife went to mass for the first time in decades.Five weeks later I went to the Alfred E. Smith Dinner in New York City. The attendees are powerful folk, movers and shakers who are used to having their way. The signs of PTSD were everywhere. People I barely knew were hugging me lavishly, telling me how glad they were to see me in frantic, overly-exuberant voices. Laughter was omnipresent and awkward, at comments that were not really funny. My best friend had memory lapses for years. So give us a brief time to cry, to grieve. Something really bad happened. Let us work through our emotions. Then after that, spit in the eye of fate and the madmen, be proud of our cities and our nationality, and gain revenge in normality.

2,FOOD & DRINK,Blondes Have More Fun!,"Marisa Churchill, Contributor

There's a new kid in town.",2013-04-18,2013-04-17-sweet_potato_blondies_01_zpsd0f8d13d.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-04-17-sweet_potato_blondies_01_zpsd0f8d13d.jpg,"Watch out brownies! There's a new kid in town. While blondies have always played a distant second to their darker inspiration, this year chocolate is taking a back seat. As blondies begin to pop up in pastry shops around the country, we are finally getting a taste for why blonde may sometimes be better. Although I am a chocoholic, I must admit that I'm liking the blondie trend. As I recently discovered, the delicate flavor of blondies makes them the perfect canvas for highlighting more subtle flavors. In fact, I have been so inspired by blondies lately that I decided to experiment. I wondered what unique flavors would be lost in a traditional chocolate brownie, yet would shine through in a blondie? I settled on using a batch of my salted bacon toffee to find out. A good batch of bacon toffee, in my opinion, must have balance. The sweet-buttery toffee should give way first to salt, then smokiness, and lastly the earthy flavors of the bacon. The combination should be subtle, slightly reminiscent of bacon dipped into maple syrup. In the past I have coated the toffee with milk chocolate. So I assumed before I began that the brownies would outshine their opaque counterpart. Much to my surprise, I was wrong. For my brownies I like to use Dutch processed unsweetened cocoa and a blend of milk chocolate and 65 percent couverture. I assumed that the rich chocolate flavor would be a great backdrop for the chunks of buttery toffee and smoky bacon. Instead, the flavors of the toffee were completely lost. The saltiness came through, but the rest of the flavors vanished, overwhelmed by the intense chocolate flavor of the brownie. At first I decided that my ratio of chocolate to toffee must be off. So I baked another batch with less cocoa and couverture, and more toffee. Sadly this unfortunate batch was like a bottle blonde with her dark roots beginning to poke through. Clearly when your brownies begin to remind you of a bad dye job, it's time to make a change. I decided it was time to try the toffee with a batch of blondies. For my blondies I like to use browned butter, dark brown sugar, and of course a hint of sea salt. The flavors of the blondie: nutty, earthy, sweet and salty proved a perfect pairing with the bacon toffee. Every nuance of the toffee was highlighted in the blondie. The combination added layers of flavor and richness; reminding me why it's not bad to go blonde from time-to-time. To jump on this year's blondie trend and experiment yourself, follow my recipe for blondies below. For my bacon toffee recipe, or my date and curry blondie recipe, pick up a copy of my cookbook Sweet & Skinny!Blondies Makes about 121 cup all-purpose flour ¼ teaspoon baking powder ¼ teaspoon soda ¼ teaspoon sea salt ½ cup browned butter ¾ cup dark brown sugar, packed 1 large egg 1teaspoon vanilla extractGrease an 8x8 inch pan. Preheat the oven to 350°F, with a rack in the center of the oven.Place a pot on the stove over medium heat. Add the butter into the pot and melt while stirring constantly. Cook until the butter becomes brown and fragrant. Turn off the heat and stir in the sugar. Allow the mixture to cool for about five minutes before continuing. While the butter cools, place the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt into a bowl. Stir the dry ingredients together.Once cooled, whisk the egg and vanilla into the butter mixture. Next whisk in the flour mixture. If adding the toffee, stir a ½ cup of chopped toffee into the batter. Transfer the blondie batter to the prepared pan. Place the blondies into the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the blondies comes out with crumbs sticking to it. Do not overbake. Allow the blondies to cool completely before cutting and serving. Store leftovers, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for up to three days."
3,WELLNESS,The Quest to Slay Bad Breath!,"Thomas P. Connelly, D.D.S., Contributor
Practicing Dentist, New York City",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bad-breath_us_5b9d0e80e4b03a1dcc84191d,I've been away from blogging for a few months because I've been on an important quest -- to help get rid of bad breath once and for all. And I want to tell you a little about what I found in my journeys.,2013-04-18,"close up of beautiful woman laughing, isolated on white background",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0e802500003300364eaa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've been away from The Huffington Post for a few months because I've been on an important quest -- to help get rid of bad breath once and for all. And I want to tell you a little about what I found in my journeys.Actually, my journey was personal, as I spearheaded the development of line of bad breath products carrying my name. It was pretty exciting. And scary. And educational. I learned more about bad breath over the past year than most people learn in a lifetime. (In fact, last year I did an entire series of posts on bad breath, outlining the different ""types."")So anyway, I got interested in bad breath because as a NYC Cosmetic Dentist, I see a lot of bad breath. And I answer a lot of questions regarding bad breath, too. The biggest question I get is what causes bad breath. Truthfully, there are a lot of different causes -- food, tobacco, dry mouth, alcohol, poor oral hygiene... the list is almost endless.But truthfully, most of those are precursors to the real culprit -- volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). VSCs are the common result of the previous ""causes"" I just listed, and are really the true cause of bad breath. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Again, ""Halitosis is caused mainly by volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as H(2)S and CH(3)SH produced in the oral cavity."" Indeed, a lot of research went into this as I developed my product.So essentially, I was left with a choice -- since I wanted to join the fight against bad breath/halitosis, which direction should I go? Should I go the coverup route and come out with Connelly Mints or something similar? Or should I get a little more scientific and look to attack the VSCs? Of course, one (the mints) sounds a lot easier than the other (attacking sulfur... how do you do that?). So of course, me being me, I went the hardest route possible (to tell you the truth, it isn't that I gravitate to the harder route -- I just wanted to develop what I think is the most effective bad breath solution, so I went more with the chemistry route than ""Dr Connelly's Breath Bombs"" -- although you have to admit, that's a pretty cool-sounding name).Anyway, attacking the sulfur was the way to go. So I studied. And my research led me to zinc. You've heard of zinc, right? It's that mineral at the end of almost every USDA information label you see. But it's more than just a funny-sounding mineral beginning with the letter Z -- it's actually very effective in reducing and eliminating volatile sulfur compounds, and, therefore, eliminating bad breath. About zinc, the Mayo Clinic said, ""Chewing gum containing zinc or rinsing out the mouth with a solution containing zinc seemed to reduce bad breath (halitosis) in early studies."" And the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health did a study on it and wrote: ""Chewing gum containing zinc acetate and magnoliabark extract can significantly reduce the oral VSC levels for more than one hour."" So basically, the consensus is that zinc can reduce VSCs for a significant period of time (""more than one hour,"" as stated in the NLMNIH study). But you know what's interesting -- in my own research in developing my product, I found that it works for up to four hours. I can't link you to a study there, as it would be just me writing, but I can tell you as a professional dentist who developed this that yes, zinc works, and it works for a long time. Okay, you've read far enough about my journey and the process of developing the product -- let me give you the link to the product website. (To be clear, this isn't a link for you to go buy it -- it's to read about it if it so interests you since I've talked about it and blogged about bad breath so much. Indeed, the website isn't even fully functional yet in terms of sales -- we sell most of the product on QVC.) But the website for my creation is here.People have asked ""Why 32?"" as the name. Can you guess why? I'll give you a second or two to think about if before I blurt out the answer... tick tock... tick tock... Ready??It's because a healthy adult has 32 teeth. (Although there are exceptions, but the common number is 32.) Anyway, that's where I've been. But now that we're done developing, you can look forward to more posts from me.Until next time, keep smiling!!For more by Thomas P.

Being polite often means not communicating how we really feel. We swallow the truth to keep our jobs, our friends and to maintain the peace in the family. It's likely better that way, but when it comes to figuring out next career and life moves, half-truths will keep you stuck.At my Kripalu weekend seminar over the Easter holiday, there were several instances of half-truths (maybe even quarter-truths) getting in the way of progress in gaining clarity, direction and momentum in life.People told me very sophisticated, planned lies for what they might do next and how they'd do it. How did I know they were not telling the truth? They might fidget or mumble, avoid eye contact or just sound dispassionate and analytical about what they were saying. Just as I would feel myself slipping into a coma, I'd whip out my magic wand.You read that right. However, in this case, I reached over to a vase of flowers and pulled out a miniature sunflower whose head fit nicely in the palm of my hand.""Now"", I said, in my best Glinda the Good Witch imitation.""If I waved my magic wand and you could have it your way now, what would you be doing?""The answers were astounding.One particular gentleman was laying out his plan very methodically when I interrupted him with my wand routine. He had an immediate response that lit up his face and made his eyes dance the cha-cha. He switched off his plan to sell insurance to get his children through the college years and told me about his dream to work in travel and see amazing places while extending that adventure to others.That's a big gap and how on earth would he make that happen?! Pipe dream, you say? I understand how you may think that. And if you do, it also tells me you hold a truth you don't tell, but we'll save that for later. Now, let me tell you how this rolled out.I got an email 36 hours after this admission was made that while on the drive home from the weekend, something came together rather quickly. As the dear man was telling his girlfriend what transpired, he remembered a trip he took to South Africa when he used to play rugby. He recalled the camaraderie among the international players and the traveling they did to explore the land, wildlife and culture. He instantly saw the connection to the recent launch of a rugby league he started in his area, which involved his own kids. He realized he could start organizing international trips for his league (like the one he took) as a business venture moving forward. He also wanted to let me know that the insurance direction was not a complete departure because insuring those trips is quite lucrative as well!This is exactly what I expect when the truth has been let out of the bag: a sudden connection, remembering, ah-ha, ""accidental"" meeting or other coming-together that closes the huge gap between the ""telling"" and real time. It doesn't seem so implausible anymore. The answers come. I know this to be true.Now, back to anyone who might have a half-truth in their plans -- I understand they sound reasonable and safe. I understand there are bills to be paid. I also know that you will not be happy, satisfied or fulfilled. Tell the whole truth and act on it. One small move (phone call, research, planning time, feasibility interviews, etc.) a day will start the momentum. Even if you have to do the half-truth plan to pay the bills, do not keep the truth buried. Bring it out and watch your life change.Author's Note:Just before publication, the gentleman in this piece wrote to me to let me know that his story, now two weeks later, has expanded to include another set of ""synchronistic"" events.He reached out to the company that had arranged the tour he was on years ago and he explained his idea about such tours for youth rugby clubs. It just so happens the proprietor had just heard from someone in the UK who wanted to get his UK youth rugby team playing in the U.S. on a tour. Thanks to our protagonist, he has a U.S. team to meet up with this summer and perhaps a reciprocal tour for the Americans in the UK.There's more to share, but for now, suffice it to say that there is so much momentum stemming from one truth-telling to make your head spin. And spin yours will when you, too, take responsibility for your truth. Keep me posted!Originally posted April 16, 2013 on the Now What?

What marathon runners know about suffering can help us all learn how to cope with this tragedy and rise above it.",2013-04-18,"WELLESLEY, MA - APRIL 16: Boston Marathon runners at the half-way water station in Wellesley coped with the staggering heat the best they could - by dousing themselves with water. (Photo by Dina Rudick/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0df52000004e00fdd05d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We are picking up the pieces once again from a great tragedy that has taken innocent lives and shattered our sense of safety in the world. Again we see before our eyes that what is good and noble on the Earth can be brought down in an instant by the evil that lurks in the shadows.The bombing that occurred at the finish line of the venerable Boston Marathon is deeply ironic in that it threatened those who had already proven their greatness by running 26.2 miles, along with the supporters who cheered them on. Many of those runners who were nearing the finish line were already carrying stories of triumph over tragedy. They were running on Patriots' Day to celebrate a personal victory or commemorate a deep loss or champion a heartfelt cause.Having run two marathons in the past, I know firsthand the dedication and inner fortitude it requires to train for and complete a marathon. What marathon runners know about suffering can help us all learn how to cope with this tragedy and rise above it:1. You must be willing to change yourself. Marathon training requires a new schedule, new priorities, new diet, and a new way of looking at life. Surviving any tragedy requires you to open up to the possibility of change and even to celebrate that change. Many of the problems in our society arise because people demand that things around them change, but are unwilling to change themselves.""You cannot change a single thing on this Earth except yourself. And when you do change yourself... it changes everything.""2. Change happens one step at a time. No one can become a marathon runner overnight. It takes patience, time and a step-wise process to train the body to perform at a high level for 26.2 miles. How much more then does life itself require patience, time, and taking simple steps? ""You must overcome your need for instant gratification and prepare yourself for 'the long haul' of life.""3. Be passionate about the goal without attachment. Training for a marathon, like surviving a tragedy, is never a sure thing. There are no guarantees that the runner will make it all the way to the race or be able to finish it after starting. But the possibility of failure is not a deterrent to the training process, and marathon runners are able to stay true to the goal even when there is no certainty of getting there.""You have to be willing to stay on the path even when you don't know for sure where it is leading you."" 4. Commitment must override comfort. Many marathon runners have to endure injuries, illness and failure on their path toward successful completion of the run. Training itself, even on the best days, is a difficult process that requires discipline and focus. Many aspects of our society promote pleasure and comfort as achievements, without an appreciation for effort and determination.""You must choose commitment to your goal over comfort in the moment if you want to change yourself and the world.""5. Don't run away from suffering. Marathon training is all about learning how to manage suffering to enhance strength and endurance. The best athletes know where the balance lies for them between discomfort and overexertion, which is the point of maximum growth. The attempt to avoid suffering at all costs leads to addiction and hopelessness, which are common problems undermining our society.""You cannot achieve greatness or fulfill your true life purpose without suffering.""When senseless tragedy befalls us -- which seems to be happening frequently these days -- it is important to remember the larger picture of life. These moments in time that would seem to crush us can also bring out the sweetness and strength we carry inside -- like grapes being prepared to become fine wine. We must accept the crushing forces brought to us by life and allow ourselves to be broken, so that we can emerge from our own process of change and transform everything around us.

6,FOOD & DRINK,"Cooking Off the Cuff: Cod With Vegetable ""Goulash""","Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cod-with-vegetable-goulash_us_5b9cf121e4b03a1dcc831fc8,This leek-potato-mushroom goulash is delicious in itself but also really comes into its own combined with the fish.,2013-04-17,Leeks and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms cooking with butter,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf120250000320036442d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"There was lovely, lovely locally fished cod at the farmers' market one day last month, and it was obviously going to be the centerpiece of a Saturday night dinner. As I was waiting my turn at the Pura Vida Fisheries stand (you can listen to an interview with the owner), I worked out a whole dish based on cabbage and caraway seeds and paprika: the fish would sit on a mound of mashed potatoes surrounded by a kind of cabbage goulash vaguely reminiscent of a sauerkraut dish from George Lang's excellent book The Cuisine of HungaryBut of course there wasn't any cabbage in the market. In recent months, last season's heads had gradually shrunken as ratty leaves were stripped away, and by now they were gone altogether. I could have walked into the supermarket and bought all the cabbage I wanted, but (apart from my preference for local produce) there was a silly obstacle. It was two days before St. Patrick's Day, and if I bought a cabbage it might be thought that I was planning to eat it with corned beef like everybody else: I could have explained myself to a farmers' market vendor, but not to a busy supermarket cashier. (We love corned beef and cabbage, but not on March 17.)There was no obvious Plan B. I really wanted to keep the paprika sauce, which is wonderful with so many fish, and I wandered around the market, browsing and musing. Leaves like kale would have a good texture but would be too flavorful; ones like spinach (of which there was quite a bit in the market) too flimsy. So I looked beyond leafy greens and hit upon leeks, potatoes, hen-of-the-woods (maitake) mushrooms and Jerusalem artichokes (a.k.a. sunchokes): the mild leeks and potatoes and the gently earthy mushrooms would make a delicious goulash-like sauce-stew, and the Jerusalem artichokes ... well, we'd see about the Jerusalem artichokes. Maybe a puree to replace the mashed potatoes I seemed to have axed?Back in the kitchen, I sweated the white (and a little of the pale green) of two leeks, sliced and well washed, in just two teaspoons of butter. After a couple of minutes I added a quarter pound of maitake, pulled apart by hand. If I'd been using regular white mushrooms, I'd have sliced them. When the mixture was cooked and much of the moisture had evaporated, I added two tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika and half a teaspoon Spanish smoked paprika (pimentón) mixed into 2/3 cup simple tomato sauce (from the freezer), a teaspoon of caraway seeds, five or six juniper berries, crushed, salt and a little water. I simmered this over low heat for 10 or 15 minutes until it tasted wonderful. Meanwhile, I steamed six small waxy potatoes, peeled. When they were not quite done, but nearly, I cut them into 3/8-inch slices and added them to the leek-mushroom mixture along with some more water to accommodate the potatoes. After five minutes further simmering, the potatoes were done. I stirred in two heaping tablespoons of crème fraîche (or use sour cream by all means) and set the pan aside to await further developments.By this time, I'd tasted the Jerusalem artichokes and found them to be watery and insipid, so I gave up the idea of a puree. But they were pleasantly crunchy when raw, so I peeled and cut up enough of them to make a scant cup of 1/4-inch dice, which I held until the fish was cooked.I generously salted five-ounce skinless portions of cod, left them in the fridge for 30 minutes, then rinsed and dried them -- this improves both the texture and the flavor -- and seasoned them with black pepper. Then I brushed the flatter side of each (where the skin had been) with beaten egg and dipped just that surface into a dish of plain breadcrumbs. Breaded side down, I started these in a lightly oiled skillet with a little butter for flavor, and when the crumbs had just begun to brown transferred the pan to a 400-degree F oven where it remained until the fish was cooked, about 10 or 12 minutes (all will depend on the shape of your fish pieces). I reheated the vegetable ""goulash"" and stirred in the diced Jerusalem artichokes just to warm through -- they remained crunchy -- and perhaps two teaspoons of lemon juice. I divided the mixture among four plates and set a piece of fish on top of each portion.The leek-potato-mushroom goulash was delicious in itself and would have made a nice lacto-vegetarian dinner with a slice of buttered bread, but it really came into its own combined with the fish; the flavors were fairly soft and nothing obscured anything else, while the slight piquancy of the paprika and lemon juice added interest.The Jerusalem artichokes? Well, they were crunchy, which provided a pleasing textural diversion. I'd use them again in a dish like this if they came to hand, but probably wouldn't walk a mile to seek them out."

Photographer: Scott Eisen/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0eeb26000036007fb7a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For us Bostonians, Patriot's Day is a holiday that's ours and ours alone. It may fall in mid-April, but the last snow has barely melted and leaves remain tightly-clenched buds on the trees. For students, it signals the first day of Spring break; colorful windbreakers and fleece jackets replace grungy down jackets that finally have the opportunity to get washed. Businesses close and families and friends' kick back, drink copious amounts of beer, watch the runners and drink more at the Sox game. Up until Tuesday, it was traditionally a really fun day in the neighborhood.Monday changed my beloved hometown forever. A sick and twisted individual saw fit to maim and murder the people of my city. My friends and family were spared, but people they know, weren't. My dear friend's son was friends with 8-year-old Martin Richard, who went to cheer on the runners with his family. His sister and brother were very badly hurt, his mother's eye was damaged and he lost his life. And my dear friend had to tell her children an incredibly painful truth.   Another friend was with his family, 30 feet from where one of the bombs went off. He miraculously escaped unscathed, and spent the afternoon covered in blood, pulling people out of the wreckage as three yellow balloons ascended into the ashy sky over Boylston Street.  As a New York transplant who witnessed 9/11, I resent the fact that I now reflexively react with a surreal calm upon the initial news of an unspeakable horror. As a parent, I resent the fact that I hug my family with an embedded hyperawareness of the preciousness of their embrace, as I now know just how life is but a fleeting gift and their love is my only shelter from the fear surrounding it. And now, I resent the fact that my friends back home will likely feel this way too.My generation was trained to operate under an ominous cloud -- a mushroom cloud. As children, we believed in the Brady Bunch and Santa and the Tooth Fairy but as teens, heightened exposure to the media would reveal an ugly truth: at any given moment, we were told, some angry, power-hungry official in a red suit could push a button and we'd all combust into dust. Helpless, we partied like it was 1999 while we waited for two tribes to go to war. We thought we'd be lucky to see 30. But war was somewhere over there, not here. Not anymore. I resent that, and I resent that individuals with no respect for human life are somehow able to roam free and plot to take life at their whim.   I'd always hoped that by the time I had kids, the perpetual veil of fear would lift or that I'd somehow locate a peaceful utopia we could nestle in. Naively, I also held fast to the idea of raising my children in truth. If I was truthful in my parenting, if I was honest and brave, my children would be honest and brave also. They wouldn't be shocked by human nature and ill-equipped to deal with the variables of life. They would expect and accept the dark with the light and be the stronger for it.   Tragedies like these shroud us in darkness with no accompanying light to fumble for. When your home is in a constant state of heightened alert, it is a huge challenge to be honest and to be brave. Utopia remains an elusive concept. The close calls or degrees from horror narrow to our immediate environs. There is no respite from the sinking feeling that something could go very, very wrong at any given second.  As parents, it is our job to make our children feel safe, so we're forced to contain our anxiety to spare our children's psyches and thus, lie in spite of a very obvious truth: There is nowhere to hide from the middle finger of fate. This is a truth I cannot bear to share with my children, so I have no choice but to hug them real tight and lie about their safety like I do about Santa, because the alternative is to burn away their innocence and smother them in fear.   My friends in Boston won't be able to lie to their kids about what happened. They will explain that a random act of violence that occurred on their streets killed an innocent child. They will know people, or know people who know people, who were hurt or affected by the blasts. They will be forced to wade through emotional grey area so murky, an adult could barely navigate through. And they will learn to lie to their children and tell them they're safe as they walk down Boylston Street at a heightened pace, dodging trash cans and compulsively checking around them for menacing clues.  In the face of such terrible truths the best we can do, as Boston-born and bred parents, is to support our children in the spirit of our tough-as-nails upbringing.  We are staunch realists. We may pepper our speech with a creative chain of curse words, but we roll up our sleeves, put on our baseball caps and point them toward whatever comes our way.   We are hearty as hell. You have to be when you have to get up at 5 a.m. to dig your car out of two feet of snow in 5-degree weather, every single day for five straight months.   Finally, we are emphatically loyal, as our passion for our sports teams can attest. We may not seem like the friendliest of folks, at first. We detest all forms of small talk and universally refer to it as ""bullshitting."" To us, friendship is a gift that must be earned and honored for when it is given, and it is life long. We are not shallow opportunists, careerists or schmoozers who are in the least impressed by who you are, what you do or how much money you have, because we know you aren't better than us. But when we love you, we love you fiercely and wholly.   My people will find their way through this tragedy as they do all things -- with more guts, soul and swagger than any other breed of human. They will be realistic, they will be strong, they will band together, take care of each other and prevail. My heart breaks that my friends and family now have to confront the aftermath of a new, ugly truth that could coat their lives with fear. My sole comfort is they were bred to be brave, as all true patriots are. "

""In 2000, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had to have my thyroid removed. As a result, I have a hypothyroid condition and need to take medicine to treat it,"" Vergara said in a statement. ""In my career, I'm known to ad lib and go off-script -- but never when it comes to my health. I make sure to 'Follow the Script' so I get exactly what my doctor prescribed. This is so important to me, because you can't enjoy what you have without your health.""As Leigh Blickey reported for HuffPost Celebrity:Vergara revealed that she discovered her thyroid issue while at her son Manolo's doctor's appointment in 2000. The physician convinced her to get a check-up and then found out that her thyroid was abnormal just by touching her throat. They did a biopsy and uncovered that her thyroid was, in fact, cancerous.An estimated 20 million Americans suffer from a thyroid disorder, according to Georgetown University, in which the thyroid doesn't produce a sufficient amount of the hormones that help regulate metabolism, body temperature, heart rate and other important functions. The illness disproportionately affects women, about one in eight of whom will develop some type of thyroid disfunction in her lifetime, according to Georgetown. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include feeling slow or tired, feeling cold, memory problems and difficulty concentrating, muscle cramps, weight gain, depression and dry skin.Vergara's condition following surgery is in line with that of many hypothyroidism patients who also underwent partial or full gland removal. Other risk factors and associated illnesses for the condition include autoimmune disorders, radiation therapy and certain medications, like the psychiatric drug lithium.Hypothyroidism is treated with medication containing levothyroxine, reported WebMD. Some cases of mild hypothyroidism don't require medication and instead are treated with a ""watch and wait"" approach. "

Eating locally, seasonally, and sustainably has long been a rallying cry in the food community, since knowing your food and where it comes from is good for people, for farmers, and for the Earth.But one common objection to sustainable eating is that eating ""green"" or ""organic"" is expensive (we've all heard the one about how Whole Foods should be called Whole Paycheck). And it's a sad and sobering truth that in all too many communities in America, healthy whole foods are difficult to obtain, and often come at a price that's higher than unhealthy convenience foods. For many, the challenge is to find a way to eat sustainably and affordably. So we talked to Nature Conservancy expert Sarene Marshall about eating green on a budget in honor of Earth Month. Her inspiring, affordable, and doable suggestions:Eat less meat. Marshall says, ""The amount of land, water and fossil fuels that go into producing meat, especially beef, is astonishing, and that's partly reflected in the price. I always have sticker-shock when I see the price of steak on a menu or in the grocery store."" Try swapping in beans and mushrooms for cost-conscious, tasty, and filling protein alternatives.Grow your own produce. ""Carbon pricing in the coming decades is likely to change the cost of eating out-of-season foods flown from far corners of the globe,"" Marshall says. ""We don't realize it's not normal to have grapes or blueberries in the grocery store in January. A statistic that has always struck me is that, during World War II, America grew almost half of its fresh produce in community gardens."" She points out that herbs in particular are expensive and highly perishable and easy to grow at home, even if you only have a windowsill or balcony for a few pots. ""If you have a tad more space, focus on growing highly perishable items that come at a high economic or environmental cost when grown commercially, like salad greens and tomatoes.""Pick your own. ""Since you provide the labor and transportation and skip the middlemen, pick-your-own prices are often lower,"" Marshall says. ""Our family picks fruit at least three times a year, and we can enjoy the delicious fruits of our labor for weeks or months afterwards,"" especially with clever storage and freezing, which brings her to...Freeze, store, and save. Extend the lifespan of produce and get more for your money by employing Marshall's smart storing and freezing strategies. ""Reusable, air-tight containers for the fridge and pantry are an investment that will pay dividends for years. Freeze food to extend its life but do it in user-friendly ways: flash-freeze items on a cookie sheet so you don't end up with a solid mass of berries or cutlets that takes forever to defrost. Label leftovers, since 'Unidentified Frozen Objects' are likely to end up in the trash. I use bright labels so everyone knows what's inside and enticing phrases like 'Yum' or 'Eat today.'""Reduce kitchen waste. ""I grew up in a household where hardly anything was thrown out--we simply couldn't afford to waste anything--so kitchen waste, especially wasted food, is a big personal pet peeve,"" Marshall says, noting that the problem of food waste goes way beyond the personal: 50% of food produced is wasted. At her house, they live by the FIFO principle for the fridge and pantry: ""In warehouses, they call this 'First In, First Out.' My seven-year-old calls this 'eat the old food first.' The principle is the same: prioritize perishables that will spoil more quickly, like greens, over items with a longer shelf-life, like carrots.""Compost. It's free, and it helps. ""We compost what we can so that our fruits and vegetables go back into our garden and don't end up in a landfill where they will produce methane gas that contributes to global warming.""Use everything you buy. ""The words 'Sell by' and 'Best by' don't mean 'use or toss by,'"" Marshall points out. ""Veggies that are about to pass their prime can be blended into soups or baked into casseroles. Chutneys and salsas are another great choice. Over-ripe fruits make great smoothies or baked goods. And most of those things can be frozen for another day.""What strategies do you use to eat sustainably on a budget?

The research -- which was released Tuesday -- also shows that half of now-divorced women did not make any contributions to a pension plan while they were married. And only one in six had rights to their ex-husband's pension after the split -- which is surprising, given that a pension plan is likely one of the marriage's largest assets (after the home). “It’s clear that divorced women face an uncertain future in retirement,” spokesperson Shellie Wells said in the press release. “Not only have many given up rights to their husband’s pension provision, they have often stopped paying into their own pension plan; dipped into savings and at worst, lost contact with any savings they have accrued.” But that wasn't the only surprising statistic to come out of this survey. Researchers also found that as many as 38 percent of divorcees had no idea what financial settlement they received after the split.

Andy Cross, The Denver Post (Photo By Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0e8926000036007fb76f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The TSA screening area at Reno-Tahoe International Airport's B gates isn't much to look at. It's a dark, cavernous processing area with well-worn linoleum floors that almost makes you feel like you're visiting a relative in prison.But looks can be deceiving. I just had the best TSA screening experience in Reno, and I'm not alone. On a recent Monday morning, my entire family transited through Terminal B, and they could scarcely believe they'd been checked by federal screeners.The TSA checkpoint at Denver International Airport looks like it's something straight out of a science fiction movie. It's a gleaming hall with the newest technology, including an array of shiny new body scanners. It's the kind of place where you'd expect to find a modern, friendly and efficient screening.Yet here, too, all is not as it seems: A few days ago, I had the single worst screening experience of my life. I still can't believe what happened.The two TSAsIn America, there are two TSAs: one that understands its real mission and seems to respect the dignity of its passengers, and another that's operating under the mistaken belief that it's the last line of defense against terrorism and that it can break a few laws, and trample on the U.S. Constitution, to get the job done.You can experience both today, with the apparent blessing of the Department of Homeland Security. Why? Because the government encourages ""random and unpredictable"" airport security, which means that it's in the TSA's best interests to have one airport that passengers actually like and another that's universally hated.No one ever said this would make sense.Best little checkpoint in RenoWhen we arrived at the Terminal B screening area in Reno, we were prepared for the worst. But the line moved quickly, and within less than a minute, we were standing in front of a TSO who greeted everyone with a friendly and genuine smile.""Looks like you guys have been in the mountains,"" he said. Our sunburned faces had given us away.Another screener checked our boarding passes and waved us through quickly. There are no full-body scanners at Terminal B, which doesn't seem to bother anyone. (And surprisingly, no terrorists have exploited that little loophole -- makes you wonder about the deterrent power of those scanners, doesn't it?)After getting our bags scanned, a screener asked my 10-year-old son, Aren, what was inside his bag.Oops. Turns out he'd left his laptop in his luggage by mistake. But the agent examining his bag didn't scold him; in fact, he cracked a joke about what else he might have packed.""Got any Tasmanian Devils in there?"" he kidded.""Uh, no,"" Aren replied.Within less than three minutes, the backpack had been rescreened and we were on our way.""Wow,"" said Aren. ""They were really friendly.""Indeed. The Reno TSAers won the airport of the year award back in 2010, which suggests we aren't the only ones who like their work.Missed it by a mile in DenverOur experience in Denver couldn't have been any different. The pre-screening area is a confusing maze of ropes and missed cues. The agent asking for our ID tried to joke around with the kids, but his humor fell flat.""And who are you?"" he said to my six-year-old daughter, studying her ticket.My daughter, who gets a little shy around strangers, said nothing. Mom and I answered for her, which only seemed to ratchet up the tension.Then we were ushered into the screening area: a baggage X-ray, a metal detector, and a body scanner. The TSA has a state policy of not separating families and isn't supposed to ask young children to go through the body scanners, so it typically allows the whole family to walk through the metal detector at the same time.But not this time. I was the last one through, and an angry-looking female TSA agent with a military-style haircut gestured me toward the full-body scanners.""I'd prefer not,"" I said.""MALE ASSIST!"" she screamed, refusing to turn to me.""You are separating me from my family,"" I said, politely.She refused to look at me, instead staring straight ahead, like a schoolgirl giving you the silent treatment.My ""male assist"" screener was not gentle. On several occasions, he nearly pulled down my pants. He also forcefully grabbed my ankles, where I had an injury. I winced. That didn't seem to bother him.For some reason, a second TSA screener began hovering around us. I have no idea why. Maybe they recognized me? Maybe they just enjoyed watching a colleague perform an ""enhanced"" pat-down?I asked my son to take pictures of the event (see photo, above).Do I look like I'm about to blow up a plane? I don't know... with that shirt and ski pants, I look like I'm ready for a day on the slopes, not someone about to embark on a glorious jihad.The experience left me a little traumatized. I mean, I don't really care if the entire Denver airport screening area sees my tighty whities, but I really felt as if the screeners were just harassing me instead of protecting America's transportation systems.There's a word for that: security circus. It's an eye-pleasing spectacle that doesn't make any sense.(And please spare me your inevitable comments about pressure-cooker bombers at marathons, which has absolutely nothing to do with airport security. Even if it did, would you really want mobile TSA teams scanning and frisking people at the next public race?)It might be hyperbole to suggest that the TSA is at war with itself, that a small number of good screeners are fighting the incompetence and arrogance of a larger group of bad screeners.But if nothing else, my own experience suggests this agency could benefit from a little more transparency. And consistency.We know, for example, that some of the New York-area airports are cesspools of TSA troubles, with corruption, thievery, and botched pat-downs in the news regularly. We also know that the government rates its own airports and compares their scores to other airports.Don't we deserve to know which airports have the best TSA agents?One thing seems clear: If every TSA screening were like the one we recently had in Denver, I would be writing about the TSA every day instead of just once a week.And if it were like the one we experienced in Reno, I would probably never have to write about the agency again. Except, maybe, to commend them on a job well done.By the way, after you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.
