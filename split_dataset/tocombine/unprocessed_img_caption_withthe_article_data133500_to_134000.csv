Kennedy Space Center)Are your kids fascinated by the miracle of flight? Whether they dream of piloting jets or rocketing into a galaxy far, far away, a circle tour of our dispersed fleet of retired space craft is a great place to foster their interest. Here are six space museums where dreams can take flight:Kennedy Space Center There is no place that tells NASA's story better than this launch site just outside of Orlando. The Kennedy Space Center has launched every NASA human space flight since 1968 and today remains an active, working space center. Kids can explore numerous rockets from NASA's earliest missions, or gape in wonder at the Saturn V rocket used to put a man on the moon. The center's newest exhibit, the Space Shuttle Atlantis, includes the ship itself as well as interactive, multimedia exhibits that let you simulate a space walk, operate a 250-ton crane, land the space shuttle, and train like an astronaut. Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum With a deck two football fields long, the 40,000-ton aircraft carrier Intrepid makes an impressive sight docked at a pier on Manhattan's West Side. It's a playground for kids, who can climb into a replica Revolutionary War-era submarine, test their mettle in a Blue Angels flight simulator, and join the ""All Hands on Deck"" program, which teaches how everything works on a ship. You can also explore the Space Shuttle Enterprise, a A-12 Blackbird (forerunner to the world's fastest plane), and a retired British Airways Concorde jet. (MORE: Find a kid-friendly hotel in New York City.)National Air and Space Museum (photo: National Air and Space Museum)The wildly popular National Air and Space Museum preserves the wondrous history of our fascination with flight and, like all Smithsonian museums, is always free to enter. Located on the National Mall in Washington DC, the place is a treasure trove of original historic aircrafts, from the 1903 Wright Flyer and Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis to Chuck Yeager's Bell X-1, John Glenn's Friendship 7 spacecraft, and the Apollo 11 command module. Since the National Mall can't hold the entire collection, the museum also includes two massive hangars near Dulles International Airport where you'll find a SR-71 Blackbird (world's fastest airplane), a Concorde (fastest commercial airplane), and the Space Shuttle Discovery.(MORE: View a family trip itinerary: 5 days in Washington DC with kids.)US Space & Rocket Center This facility in Huntsville, Alabama, has played a part in the space race since the 1950s and was integral to the Apollo missions and space shuttle program. In addition to exploring 1,500 space exploration artifacts at the Marshall Space Flight Center, don't miss the fun series of simulators that let you experience what the G-force of a rocket launch feels like, fight centripetal force, fly an Apache helicopter, and more. If you're up for an extended stay, consider signing up your family or child for Space Camp.Johnson Space Center (Space Center Houston)""Houston, we have a problem."" When astronaut Jack Swigert of Apollo 13 uttered those famous words, he was speaking to NASA's mission control at the Johnson Space Center. Visitors gain access through Space Center Houston, where you can arrange to have lunch with an astronaut, visit the historic mission control for the Apollo missions, and then flash forward to visit the modern mission control, which currently assists the crew of the International Space Station. You can check out displays and artifacts of the orbiting laboratory, and get a glimpse of life on board the ISS. You can also see a working lunar rover trainer used by astronauts and the last manned spacecraft that flew to the moon, and kids can even touch one of only five lunar rocks accessible to the public.California Science Center The West Coast's largest hands-on science center, the California Science Center in Los Angeles, is the permanent home of the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Be sure to visit the companion exhibit illuminating California's role in the shuttle program in California, where the orbiters were built. Before a weekend visit to view Endeavour, go online to get a timed reservation. --Dave Parfitt of Adventures by Daddy contributed this to MiniTime.com."

2,WELLNESS,A Surprising Genetic Risk Factor For Type 2 Diabetes Is Discovered,Meredith Melnick,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/international-research-gr_us_5b9dbd59e4b03a1dcc8c47aa,"""As far as I know, this is the first time a version of a gene from Neanderthal has been connected to a modern-day disease",2013-12-26,"FILE - The March 20, 2009 file photo shows the prehistoric Neanderthal man ""N"", left, as he is visited for the first time by another reconstruction of a homo neanderthalensis called ""Wilma"", right, at the Neanderthal museum in Mettmann, Germany. The world famous fossil ""N"" is estimated being about 40.000 years old; ""Wilma"" was built by Dutch artists Alfons and Adrie Kennis for the National Geographic magazine on a skeleton from the American museum of natural history in New York. Theories about when the last Neanderthals walked the Earth may have to be revised, according to a study that suggests they became extinct in their last refuge in Spain much earlier than previously thought. Previous dating of bone fossils found at Neanderthal sites in the region put the youngest at about 35,000 years. But researchers from Australia and Europe re-examined the bones using an improved method to filter out contamination and concluded that the remains are about 50,000 years old. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dbd592000004e00fe14b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"All environmental factors being equal, Mexican Americans and other Latinos are at nearly twice the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than any other ethnic group. Now, an international research group known as the SIGMA (Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas) Type 2 Diabetes Consortium, may be a step closer to understanding why. In the largest ever genetic study of its kind, researchers publishing in the journal Nature conducted a DNA analysis of more than 8,000 residents of Mexico and people who lived in Latin America and discovered a gene variant that highly correlates to developing the disease. People who carry one copy of the variant of this gene, named SLC16A11, have a 25 percent greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, while those who inherit the gene variant from both parents -- meaning they have two copies of it -- have a correlating 50 percent risk of developing the disease. The researchers estimate that this SLC16A11 variation accounts for about 20 percent of Latinos' increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Approximately half of people with recent indigenous American ancestry -- which includes those of Mexican descent -- have this genetic variation. It is exceedingly rare among those of European extraction, about 2 percent of whom carry it, though 20 percent of those with East Asian ancestry also have the marker. Of particular intrigue for the researchers was the fact that the variant is absent in African populations. That's unusual because all humans originally came from Africa, which implies that this particular gene developed after humans left the continent.The Broad Institute explained: In order to understand this unusual pattern, the team conducted additional genomic analyses, in collaboration with Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and discovered that the SLC16A11 sequence associated with risk of type 2 diabetes is found in a newly sequenced Neanderthal genome. Analyses indicate that the higher risk version of SLC16A11 was introduced into modern humans through mixing with Neanderthal.After leaving Africa, humans interbred with a population of Neanderthals some 60,000-70,000 years ago, reported the BBC.""As far as I know, this is the first time a version of a gene from Neanderthal has been connected to a modern-day disease,"" Harvard geneticist, David Altshuler told NPR's Shots blog, although he noted that there is no evidence this distinct species of human had the disease, merely that they carried a marker for it. The gene is expressed in the liver and is involved in the transportation of metabolites that affect fat levels in cells. By altering the level of the gene variant's proteins, researchers found that they were able to affect the amount of a type of fat that is linked to Type 2 diabetes. ""By expanding our search to include samples from Mexico and Latin America, we've found one of the strongest genetic risk factors discovered to date, which could illuminate new pathways to target with drugs and a deeper understanding of the disease,"" co-author José Florez, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an Assistant Physician in the Diabetes Unit and the Center for Human Genetic Research at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a statement. ""We are already using this information to design new studies that aim to understand how this variant influences metabolism and disease, with the hope of eventually developing improved risk assessment and possibly therapy,” added Teresa Tusie-Luna, project leader at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán and principal investigator at the Biomedical Research Institute, National University of Mexico."

They were in their 40s. Grandpa died in 1979 and Aunt Ruth moved in to be with Grandma. Aunt Ruth passed on recently and Grandma, now 90, has been here alone. Janet, Grandma's youngest daughter, has just moved Grandma to her place uptown. Most everything's been moved out, given to children, grandchildren and cousins. The old grandfather clock, the dining room set, the furniture, the books, clothes, jewelry, records... things. A solitary rubber glove hangs from the kitchen shelf. A book of matches from my early childhood sits on the worn Formica counter. The smell of old soap lingers in the empty linen closet. In the silence, there is a symphony of years and lives. In the emptiness, there is fullness and eternity. This is the place where I first crawled in warm pools of light and care. It is my alpha and my omega, my sanctuary, my womb, my fortress. On this gray autumn afternoon, nothing can hurt me here. Not a million terrorists, atom bombs or diseases. Not even the girl I love leaving me. Once, I lived in this place. Now, forever, it lives in me.info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.com"
