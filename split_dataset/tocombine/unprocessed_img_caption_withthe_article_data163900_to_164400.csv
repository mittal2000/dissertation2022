Magazine. The circle, which, according to the BBC, attracts some 250,000 visitors annually, was described by the magazine as ""the best-preserved and most impressive complex of prehistoric sites in Europe."" Avebury's small(ish) number of visitors has likely helped protect it much unlike China's 43 sites that are threatened by excessive tourism. In contrast, Stonehenge saw more than one million visitors in 2011 (excluding solstice celebrations and school groups), according to an English heritage website. Stonehenge, it should be noted, sits some 38 miles away from Avebury; curious visitors can access both via a walking trail that opened in 2011. The site was deemed better than Machu Picchu, the Pyramids in Egypt and the Taj Mahal, all of which are often considered the bucket list of travelers, according to AOL Travel UK. Avebury doesn't even make the top 10 of National Geographic's best World Heritage Sites. What do you think? Is Avebury impressive? Leave it in comments. "

They now believe the disease begins at least a decade before symptoms appear.""The scientific community and the FDA believe that it is critical to identify and study patients with very early Alzheimer's disease before there is too much irreversible injury to the brain,"" said Dr. Russell Katz, director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.Current Alzheimer's drugs treat symptoms, but none has been proven to interrupt the steady destructive course of Alzheimer's that robs sufferers of their memories and independence.""I think this will be hugely useful to the pharmaceutical industry,"" said Dr. Paul Aisen of the University of California, San Diego, and director of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a joint effort between the university and the National Institute on Aging focused on identifying the earliest signs of Alzheimer's.Aisen said the draft document will help companies design clinical trials to test drugs in people before dementia strikes, such as prodromal disease, a precursor to Alzheimer's in which mild cognitive changes have occurred and there is some biomarker evidence, such as a brain scan, that suggests the changes are related to Alzheimer's disease.The need for new treatments is great and growing. A study on Wednesday suggested that the number of Americans with Alzheimer's disease would triple to 13.8 million by 2050.Drug companies have been working for years to develop so-called disease-modifying drugs, but so far, with little success.Last summer, a promising drug called bapineuzumab being developed by Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Elan, failed to show a benefit in large trials of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.And a drug by Eli Lilly and Co known as solanezumab also failed to meet the main goals of two large trials in this same population. But the drug did appear to show a slight benefit in mild patients when results of both studies were pooled.Researchers now plan to study Lilly's drug in patients with earlier-stage disease, including a trial known as the ""A4"" prevention study, which will study 1,000 volunteers aged 70 to 85 with pre-symptomatic disease, who have not yet developed significant memory problems.The trial will be managed by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study under Aisen's direction.Several other so-called prevention studies are testing drugs in people who are genetically predisposed to develop Alzheimer's at an early age. In one study, members of a large family in Colombia will test a drug from Roche Holding AG's Genentech unit known as crenezumab.Maria Carrillo of the Alzheimer's Association, which has worked with the National Institute on Aging to develop new guidelines for identifying Alzheimer's at an earlier stage, said the proposed changes ""open the door wider for those of us working on and thinking about prevention trials.""The FDA said the move is part of the government's efforts to respond to Alzheimer's as part of the National Alzheimer's Plan signed by President Obama last year. The plan aims to find an effective way to prevent or treat Alzheimer's by 2025.The draft document can be found at: "

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for John Varvatos)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccc342000004e00fdb7dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In late 2009, while doing an interview for a still-in-progress book on Austin's live music scene, I was able to sit down with Brent Grulke, the late creative director and co-founder of the uber-influential South by Southwest Festival. The interview included story after story about what life was like in Austin in the early 1980s and how Grulke and a band of friends got together to make both the Austin Chronicle and SXSW cultural icons in the Lone Star State. At the end of the conversation, feeling inspired, I shared an idea: ""Why not do a style or fashion component during SXSW?""Fast forward to today and I'm proud to share that two of the most important American menswear designers, and two guys who know a thing or two about the intersection of music and style, will be making their way to Austin this March. But you may be surprised what they'll be doing while they're visiting the Texas capital. John Varvatos, the menswear icon and frequent face on NBC's Fashion Star, will be a leading voice in HuffPost Style Sessions, developed for The Neighborhood -- a new style-centric showcase launching March 11-14 this year in Downtown Austin's 2nd Street District. The Q&A series will be hosted by HuffPost Style with executive editor Anya Strzemien moderating the discussion. Varvatos has been making his presence felt in the menswear industry dating back to the 1980s, when he started at Polo Ralph Lauren before taking over menswear design at Calvin Klein, later returning to lead menswear at Polo in the mid '90s. In 2000, he launched his eponymous brand to critical acclaim and preceded to win the Council of Fashion Designers of America Perry Ellis Award for New Menswear Designer and followed it up with Menswear Designer of the Year, an unprecedented feat. ""I am very excited to be part of The Neighborhood & HuffPost's 'Style Sessions' discussing my two favorite subjects -- music and fashion. It's an interesting link, and one that has quite an effect on pop culture,"" said Varvatos, who often styles Gary Clark, Jr., one of the more recent stars to come out of Austin's famous live music scene.Joining Varvatos will be fellow multiple CFDA Menswear winner Billy Reid. Reid won last year's CFDA Menswear Designer of the Year Award, and can routinely be found hosting live music performances in his shops and during SXSW where he host a music showcase each year. As I wrote last year, Reid's ""Southern-bred luxury"" has found a home in Austin just blocks from the one of the world's premier independent record shops, Waterloo Records.""We really enjoy opportunities where creative spirits can overlap and music is a natural love for us. It one of the favorite parts of our jobs,"" said Reid. ""The city of Austin and music -- really cannot be separate thoughts. The scene here nurtures it and welcomes all to enjoy it. We are so proud to be a part of such a great community.""The Neighborhood is the newest project undertaken by myself and my business partner Jon Pattillo, a 9th generation Austin resident and veteran of the design, music and merchandising industries. Over the last two years Jon and I worked hand-in-hand with key producers at SXSW to create and produce an event I named ""Style X"" (pronounced ""style by""), playing off the locals' moniker for the festival ""South by."" And those two years brought forth more than 100 brands from American Apparel and Keds to What Goes Around Comes Around and Zanerobe, along with an estimated 35,000 shoppers in just four days of showcasing. To make it even more dynamic, we put together panels featuring the likes of The Man Repeller, Marcus Troy, and editors from Elle, Nylon and other fashion-savvy publications. It was a great time if you made it, but our partnership with SXSW came to an amicable end.WIth that experience, The Neighborhood was born. Along with these talks, The Neighborhood attendees can look forward to pop-up shops, lounges, blogger talk and panels, and parties with DJ studs like Mick Boogie. Mick, too, will be a guest speaker during The Neighborhood sharing his insights from years spent working with brands like Adidas Originals and artists like Jay-Z. I'm guessing he knows a thing or two about style with that kind of resume.Both the Varvatos and Reid talks will be completely free and open to the public with no badges required so that both official SXSW badgeholders and Austinites (often fearful of the massive festival) can venture downtown to 2nd Street District for insightful discussions as part of the HuffPost Style Sessions.If you've been to Austin during SXSW, you may be thinking to yourself, ""Wow, do they really have room for a big fashion event too?"" My answer: If there's room for Nike to put in a full basketball court or Doritos to create a vending machine stage (as both did last year during the festival), there has to be plenty of room in The Neighborhood for style too. See you in March."

The infrastructure isn't fabulous and few locals,2013-02-08,"This Sept. 10, 2012 image released by Sports Illustrated shows a model being photographed on location in Guilin, China, for the 2013 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. Sports Illustrated took its models to all seven continents for the first time. The around-the-globe effort will be chronicled by the Travel Channel in a special on Feb. 17. Sports Illustrated said Tuesday it's the first to do a fashion shoot in Antarctica, where temperatures were subfreezing. Among the locations featured are Namibia, China, Australia and Easter Island, one of the most remote places on Earth. Swimsuit magazine editor MJ Day says it took seven months to complete. Sports Illustrated will reveal its cover Monday. It can be a star-making opportunity. Last year's cover model was Kate Upton. The magazine hits newsstands Feb. 12.

One location used for issue -- the only one already known to the public -- already stands out for its touristic potential. The question is: Can the Swimsuit Issue put Guilin, China on the tourist map?A city of close to five million, Guilin sprawls along the Li River in Guangxi Province, which borders Vietnam. The city has been popular with domestic tourists, including emperors, since the Ming Dynasty. The Chinese come to see the beautiful karst formations, teeth of jagged limestone that jut above the river. The landscape shows that Chinese painters weren't prone to exaggeration.But Guilin has never been a particularly popular destination for foreigners. The infrastructure isn't fabulous and few locals speak English. But inconvenience rarely stands between travelers and beauty. The Grand Canyon isn't, after all, in a very convenient location. Nor is Las Vegas for that matter.And, Guilin has views to rival both. At night, neon lights illuminate the pagodas on Shan Lake. During the day, fishermen and their cormorants take to the river -- often through a scenic veil of mist -- and float between towering peaks. Though there aren't that many models in Bikinis just standing around, the Merryland Resort offers mini-skirted women admittance for a reduced price. The city has a bit of a sense of humor.It also has, in Reed Flute Cave, one of the more stunning destinations for amateur spelunkers on Earth. Stalactites and stalagmites are in full force here even if travelers can't remember which is which.Exposure in Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue likely won't make this the most popular destination in Asia, but it should serve as a reminder of how much there is to see in China beyond the bright lights and big smog of Shanghai and Beijing."

Or maybe you live on dwarf planet Pluto? Apparently, we are fighting over everything. It starts pretty much right away when we are at our most vulnerable. Most neurotic. Most pregnant.You're a victim of over-medicalized births if you give birth in a hospital. You're a dopey hippy prioritizing your birth ""experience"" over the health of your baby if you do it at home. You can't win.Then it's breastfeeding, bottle feeding or supplementing? Then, when to stop breastfeeding. Or where and when to do it in public. Or how long it is OK for a baby to keep using a bottle. What about a pacifier? You're wrong no matter what.Then, sleep training: You're either a monster or a needless sufferer of sleep deprivation.Then, disciplining: You're either overindulging a budding brat,or stifling a creative genius.Are you over-parenting and creating anxiety-ridden over-scheduled children, or are you free-range parenting and abdicating your responsibilities?Are you staying at home and sacrificing too much of yourself, or are you working and sacrificing your children?Everyone is judging you!!!!Or maybe no one is.Here's the thing. The mommy wars are a well-worn script, but there's no battle taking place among anyone I know. Can my circle of friends and acquaintances be such unique exception to this far-reaching trend? Are we the Switzerland of a larger war? Or is it possible that the whole battle is some kind of a media-generated fantasy?When I enter into conversations, live or virtual, about any of these supposedly incendiary topics, they most often end with, ""but of course each family has to do what's best for each family."" Or ""kids are resilient."" Or some variant of ""None of this will matter in a few years."" We pat each other on the back, and we empathize with the struggles we face rather than fight over which solution is right. And these are not just platitudes. I think the prevailing mom culture, among my friends and on the corner of blogosphere I inhabit, is one of support and acceptance. We know this is hard, we know we don't get enough support (through paid leave policies, work flexibility, a ready community of other moms). So, we commiserate.In fact, after the now notorious ""Are You Mom Enough"" Time cover, most moms I know were not outraged over long-term breastfeeding or the implication if they failed to do it they were some how less of a mother. They were outraged at Time magazine for pitting us against each other and exploiting our insecurities in order to sell magazines. For stoking a conflict we didn't want to fight.So, I don't think there's an active mommy war taking place. Or maybe there's a detente? Or maybe pockets of resistance fighting? Enough battle metaphors yet?)But there's one place where the conflict is certainly not a fantasy. And that's within me.Despite the fact that I've never been openly criticized about any of these difficult parenting decisions and do not feel judged about my decisions by my immediate community, I apologize or fall over myself trying to justify all of them. I kept secret our long labored over decision to sleep train our baby. When used disposables I had a justification at the ready for why we failed to use cloth. I have freakin' elevator pitch for why I'm currently staying at home.If no one I know is judging me -- in fact, most are supporting me -- so why do I feel I need to justify all my decisions?Besides this simply being a deeply personal flaw, I can think of two reasons. (1) The media (yup, I'm going to go ahead and blame ""the media"" while using ""the media"" as a platform) has ginned up and propelled this conflict so much that that I've internalized it. Even though it doesn't reflect my personal experiences, it's part of the Zeitgeist and I can't escape it. In which case, F U Mommy War Industrial Complex!Number 2: There are simply too many choices in modern American motherhood. I currently live in Kenya. Here, there aren't a bunch of parenting philosophies to choose from. Generally, people do things the same as their neighbors, parents and cousins. So, no one's really judging you, and you don't have to labor over (sorry) and then doubt your decisions. So, as much as the mommy wars could be a ginned up controversy, there's some of it that's probably sadly inevitable. I suppose that's the paradox of modernity. We have more freedom to tailor the experience of motherhood. But the more choices we have the more battles there are to fight. With others and within ourselves."

If you're a gamer of any kind, you've probably entered that or similar combinations of buttons into your controller, seeking to enable invincibility, infinite ammo or endless power-ups. In today's video games, cheat codes are everywhere -- originating as secret back doors for programmers to enable them to jump to specific points in the game to test for bugs, cheat codes are in the mainstream now, with the option to enter them usually front and center on most games' main menus. Some are pretty harmless, like sticking a mustache on your character or changing his outfit. But others turn you into an omnipotent juggernaut mowing down hapless bots as you stroll brazenly through bloody, bullet-strewn battlefield after bloody bullet-strewn battlefield, with no need to strategize, conserve your resources or, you know, duck. If you're an adult and that's the gaming experience you want, bully for you. But for kids, being able to quickly button-mash their way out of the effort required to finish a game legitimately with its puzzles and dangers intact is one of the worst life lessons they can learn in their formative years. Just a few short years ago I swore I'd never give a ""kids these days"" speech, but here I am, as inevitably as the tides.I grew up in the era of the quarter-sucking arcade and the first home video game console systems, when the kid whose dad got him the Atari for Christmas was the epicenter of the neighborhood social scene. In those days, you started with three lives, and no matter how far you got in the game, the exhaustion of those lives meant starting again from the beginning. The game might be magnanimous enough to offer you an extra life or two when you reached a certain point threshold, but if you were an amateur gamer like myself, struggling to elude those infuriating multicolored ghosts as you wheeled Pac-Man wildly through his maze of blinking dots, that was a rare prize indeed. There was no such thing as ""leveling up"" -- the aliens descended progressively faster while your skill set remained constant, limited to the extent of your hand-eye coordination. No armor upgrades, invincibility potions or uber-mega-cannons to be found. Mario was forever a lone soldier with nothing more than his ability to jump to a finite height pitted against the merciless barrel throwing of Donkey Kong. And even though the frustration factor was enough to make us want to punch through the screen as we watched our Galaga fighter explode into pixel shards, the challenge, and the fun, kept us coming back. If we'd all hated the experience that much, the nostalgic Wreck-It Ralph never would have been made.In today's games, along with increasingly sophisticated graphics and cinematic behind-the-scenes talent has come checkpoints, save points, official strategy guides and enough in-game cheats both hidden and obvious to let you plow through to the end in a few meager hours of play. You never die in a game anymore; it merely pauses for a few seconds before you respawn in the same place (maybe back a few hundred in-game meters) with little to no penalty. And almost every single in-game danger or problem can be mitigated by a cheat code. Running out of ammo? There's a cheat for that. Missing a crucial key to unlock the next door? There's a cheat for that too. SimCity remains a magnificent recreation of the trials of urban planning and municipal management, where success depends on learning how to allocate scarce resources and resolve the political consequences of important decisions. Without a landfill, garbage will pile up on your streets, but residents will complain and move away if you put it too close to them, and so on. But even SimCity has a cheat that gifts you with infinite cash and reduces the cost of all city improvements to zero. (I'm sure plenty of mayors and planners would love access to that!) Instead of putting in the mental exertion or the time commitment to try and solve the puzzle -- and develop their critical thinking at the same time -= a kid's first recourse is to beg Dad if he can go online for a code. Unfortunately, for most gaming kids, getting to the end as quickly as possible, enjoying the spoils without the effort, is their primary goal. But they're wrong -- the essence and purpose of the game is the journey.Funnily enough, the reward for reaching the end absent any risk or need to think about what you're doing is usually just a brief cut-scene followed by developer credits. I don't know about you, but I'm not that interested in who the second graphics assistant coordinator is for Halo, and I don't suspect Junior cares or understands either. I also know that giving in to the temptation of cheat codes is the quickest way to lose interest in a game. I remember racing through the Facility level on GoldenEye 64 time and again, dodging bullet hits left and right from digital Soviet soldiers to complete the mission in under two minutes and five seconds and unlock the invincibility achievement. Sure, there were times I wanted to chuck the controller against the wall, but I kept playing, kept trying to shave off crucial seconds. Then I discovered that you could actually achieve the same feat with a few button pushes instead. Once I did that, the challenge of beating the game was gone, and so was my joy in playing it. I played it perhaps a half-dozen times after that before it was consigned to a basement box.In an era when everyone is a beautiful snowflake and no one is allowed to fail lest their precious feelings be hurt, cheat codes are another message to children that they don't really need to try, that they will be carried along to the next level regardless of how mediocre their performance is. There is no point in trying, because there's always a way to cheat yourself out of a tight spot. The nobility of effort is a lost concept, and the video games we give our kids to play are emblematic of this problem. Getting crushed by Donkey Kong's barrels or caught by Inky, Blinky, Pinky or Sue were, in own their strange way, important rites of passage. They taught us that we had to consider different approaches and to try harder if we wanted to get ahead and save the princess. One shudders at the thought of a generation of adults raised to believe that they need only to touch the right combination of buttons in order to be granted whatever they desire. (That worked really well the last time I wanted a new car, and infinite ammo for my bazooka.) Or worse -- rushing through life to get to the disappointing cut-scene at the end.Life has no cheat codes. Video games shouldn't either."
