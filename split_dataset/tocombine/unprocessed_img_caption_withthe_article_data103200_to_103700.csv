2,POLITICS,What to Expect From Obama?,"Julia E. Sweig, ContributorLatin America Foreign Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-to-expect-from-obama_b_6255440.html,"With two more years in the White House, is Barack Obama really a lame duck, or can we expect some audacity from this often infuriatingly low-key president?  Based on what we've seen in just one month, my bet is on a lot more to come.",2014-12-03,"President Barack Obama speaks to the media in the briefing room of the White House, Monday, Nov. 24, 2014, in Washington, after the Ferguson grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6916f4230000821839f74c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just four weeks ago the Republican Party won the Senate, substantially increased its majority in the House of Representatives, and now resides in governors' mansions in 32 of 50 states. By most accounts, the Democrats' defeat represented a referendum against their president. With two more years in the White House, is Barack Obama really a lame duck, or can we expect some audacity from this often infuriatingly low-key president? Based on what we've seen in just one month, my bet is on a lot more to come. On immigration, the president defied an obstreperous Congress and used his executive powers to give as many as five million people legal status in the United States, while putting even more money and manpower on the border. The political calculus is clear enough -- most of those who will acquire legal status are likely over time to vote for Democrats, unless the Republican Party can reinvent itself as more inclusive and representative. And making it easier to live and work legally also brings significant economic benefit to the country. But the humanitarian value of Obama's immigration move is just as significant. We are indeed a nation of immigrants, with a remarkable capacity to absorb newcomers. The accusations of imperial presidency notwithstanding, Obama did the right thing on this one.And then there's climate change. Ten months in the making, the non-treaty agreement with China announced during Obama's Beijing visit last month puts diplomatic muscle into global climate talks that could well show substantive results in both Lima this month and Paris next year. And while it is true that during his first term he put his domestic capital behind healthcare reform instead of cap and trade legislation, my guess is Obama will continue using his executive and existing legislative authority to reduce carbon emissions.National security/foreign policy is the space that confounds both Obama's staunchest defenders and his toughest critics. He fired Chuck Hagel after barely two years as Secretary of Defense and reportedly ran through several choices before finding a willing successor. But replacing Hagel's alleged passivity won't substantially improve matters. It is unclear whether the problem is the insularity of the White House national security team, or that the constellation of acute challenges from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Israel, Russia, ISIS, and an array of non-state actors is simply too complex to navigate. David Rothkopf's new book, National Insecurity, suggests the answer is 'all of the above.' But Rothkopf also argues that in the face of complexity and cacophony, sometimes the best response is to simplify (inside) and to listen (outside). And then there's Ferguson, which embodies our major cleavages of race, class, and injustice, hundreds of years in the making. Two years won't heal those wounds; unequivocal presidential leadership might help.This post was originally published in Portuguese in Folha de São Paulo. It is originally available here."
3,SPORTS,The Fall of Robert Griffin III -- Is it Fair?,"Leigh Steinberg, ContributorSports and Entertainment Agent",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-fall-of-robert-griffi_b_6256492.html,"In the contemporary, ""nothing matters but this game"" NFL, spurred on by constant criticism in talk radio and social media, the slow development of a quarterback is not allowed. Win or be benched is the new mantra.",2014-12-03,"SANTA CLARA CA, NOVEMBER 23: Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III (10) sits on the bench in the final minutes of the game as the San Francisco 49ers defeat the Washington Redskins 17 - 13 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara VA, November 23, 2014 (Photo by John McDonnell/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb775fa2400005000988add.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Few players have come into the NFL with so much fanfare and succeeded as quickly as Robert Griffin III. He was featured on national ads like ""Subway,"" his jersey was a red-hot item throughout the country, and he was treated by Washington Redskins fans as the second coming.His rookie season was a revelation. He took the long-suffering Redskins to the playoffs. He had a QB rating of 102.4, threw 20 touchdown passes with only five interceptions and ran for 815 yards. Griffin-mania excited the entire NFL. And now, in his third season, he is benched, with speculation that he may never play for the Redskins again. Is it his fault, or is he a sacrificial lamb?The Redskins paid an unheard of price of draft picks in 2012 to move up only four spots in the draft and select Griffin. The St. Louis Rams received three first-round draft picks and one second-round pick from Washington to move down. As massive as the draft pick surrender was, franchise quarterbacks are difficult to find. Had Griffin continued to develop and enhanced the Redskins' chance to win over the next ten years, the trade would have been judged more favorably. Griffin is under contract with the team through the 2015 season and, in May, the team can choose to exercise an option for an additional season salaried at roughly $18 million.Griffin was the Offensive Rookie of the Year for 2012, playing in an offense specifically designed for him by head coach Mike Shanahan and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. It borrowed elements from his college game. It had option-style running plays and the pistol offense. He needed to learn how to protect his body better by throwing the ball away more quickly and by sliding at the end of runs.The evolution to being a better pocket passer with an escape dimension has been mastered by a number of young quarterbacks. Colin Kaepernick and Russell Wilson are two examples. Griffin suffered a major knee injury during the Redskin's playoff loss in 2012. That and a coaching change hampered his progress.When Jay Gruden and his new coaching staff took over, they stripped the Baylor type plays out of the offense and took away what RG3 did so well his rookie season. He has been forced to adapt too quickly to a classical pocket passer role.The Colts have done everything they can to make the transition of Andrew Luck, a very successful young quarterback drafted just ahead of RG3, easier. They drafted Coby Fleener, Luck's college tight end from Stanford. Last year, they hired Pep Hamilton as offensive coordinator, the same role he played for Luck at Stanford. Luck is running the same offense he did in college. Of course, RG3 ultimately bears the responsibility for his performance, but supportive coaching and game plans can cushion the early years. It is critical not to prematurely break the confidence of the young player or the team's confidence in him.The performance of Kirk Cousins in training camp seemed to dim Griffin's desirability. Cousins went quickly this year from ""next great star"" to the bench. A fundamental principal of quarterback development is allowing that player the confidence of knowing he is the starter and sticking with him through the rougher patches. With time, a young quarterback will develop more field command and proficiency. But in the contemporary, ""nothing matters but this game"" NFL, spurred on by constant criticism in talk radio and social media, the slow development of a quarterback is not allowed. Win or be benched is the new mantra. How many great quarterbacks would have been thrown on the trash heap of history with this philosophy?Questions are being raised now about Griffin's work ethic, the same thing that was praised his rookie year. Speculation on diminished trade value runs rampant. If it does not work out in Washington, some fortunate team is going to end up with a young quarterback with rare gifts. A patient coach will devise a system that takes advantage of intelligence, a strong arm and escape dimension.Over time, RG3 will return to build on his first-year performance and end up being a star in the NFL."
4,HEALTHY LIVING,Our Bodies Wear Out,"Abby Pingree, ContributorHospice Nurse, Mother, Wife, Grateful",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/our-bodies-wear-out_b_6256594.html,"Perhaps with courage and acceptance we can make friends with our own mortality, and with acceptance we can be a peaceful presence when given the opportunity to experience the death of a loved one.",2014-12-03,2014-12-02-10527667_10203505140763362_2157467582032917192_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-10527667_10203505140763362_2157467582032917192_n-thumb.jpg,"As a hospice nurse I often have very difficult conversations with people. I come in to their homes and say things like ""our bodies wear out"" and ""bodies are temporary."" I speak slowly -- intuitively trying to gauge the individual or families' ability to handle and absorb what I am saying. My goal is not to upset people but to bring understanding and, if possible, bring some acceptance. I have seen that this acceptance generates peace and comfort. Death comes whether we agree to it or not but with acceptance comes a decrease in suffering. My goal is to help reduce suffering whenever I can -- sometimes I can and sometimes I cannot.In my line of work I often meet people who do not want to accept the truth of their current condition. They say, ""This should not be happening to me."" Occasionally I can, very gently, help them find acceptance, to snuggle into the truth of what is. I once met an old man near the end of his life who was heartbroken because he could no longer walk to his kitchen. He was angry and pained deeply by this; he was ready to give up and recede into sorrow. I took his hand, looked into his eyes and said: ""Bodies wear out. Did you really think that you were exempt from this?"" He was quiet, and then he smiled and said:"" I guess I thought I was."" A light crept into his eyes and we laughed and laughed. He had a wonderfully loving family, more than willing to get him anything he might need from the kitchen. He agreed to accept help from his loved ones with gratitude; he started to feel very loved and appreciated. He was on board for the experience of his body wearing out. It was beautiful to see.We all will die, this is certain. Perhaps this is the most profound truth of all time, if only because of its unchangeable and concrete nature. Yet we deny and avoid this truth to no end. Often I am instructed by a patient's family not to use the word ""hospice"" or ""death."" The family members, though well intended, are trying to shield their loved one from the truth. I see in their eyes deep denial and fear. I always respect family's wishes because the hospice experience is their own, I will however, if it seems appropriate, give a gentle reminder that there can be great comfort and great peace at the end of life. I may even invite people to entertain the idea of a different experience of death, an experience not of fear, pain, and loss but one of deep intimacy and harmony. End of life can be a profoundly personal family time, the sharing of a sacred spiritual experience, a celebration of life and appreciation. If I have seen anything in my hospice work it is that the end of life need not be unnecessarily painful, emotionally or physically. We have fantastically strong medications to address any physical symptom. And if we are willing to look at our ideas, fears, and denial surrounding death maybe we can decrease the emotional suffering as well. There is grief, I am not denying that there is grief, but when the pain of loss is met with honesty then there is the opportunity for profound love and understanding. Perhaps with courage and acceptance we can make friends with our own mortality, and with acceptance we can be a peaceful presence when given the opportunity to experience the death of a loved one. "

Earth's forests are literally made of carbon, a dominant component of everything from branches, foliage and roots to leaf litter, soils and peat deposits.

These innovators are seizing climate change as an opportunity to show leadership as well as act in their own enlightened self-interest. This must continue -- and we need much more.Reducing carbon emissions is the most visible climate mitigation strategy, but a major challenge lies in the carbon we've already put in the atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon pollution has raised atmospheric CO₂ concentration from about 220 parts per million (ppm) to more than 400 ppm; 350 ppm or less is needed to limit the most severe consequences.Although technologies are emerging to remove the CO₂ that's already in the atmosphere, right now forests remain the only means for doing this at scale. By restoring forests on previously cleared and marginal areas in the tropics, we could remove half a gigaton of carbon from the atmosphere annually, more than the emissions of all cars in the United States combined.The more scientists look, the more we understand the innumerable values of tropical forests to people. Forests supply fresh water that irrigates crops and powers hydroelectric dams, even as they slow the torrents that cause some floods and mudslides. They directly support more than a billion people with fiber, shelter, food and livelihoods. They are the source of many of our most potent antibiotics and other medicines.

We also need to let loose the ingenuity of companies, investors and enterprising governments in finding their own ways to tackle deforestation.September's climate summit in New York saw a flurry of promising progress. The governments of Peru, Norway and Germany hatched a partnership to make Peru carbon-neutral within a decade. Companies like Kellogg's and Nestlé pledged to slow destruction of tropical forests by changing how they buy soybeans, palm oil and other commodities. These innovators are seizing climate change as an opportunity to show leadership as well as act in their own enlightened self-interest. This must continue -- and we need much more.Reducing carbon emissions is the most visible climate mitigation strategy, but a major challenge lies in the carbon we've already put in the atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon pollution has raised atmospheric CO₂ concentration from about 220 parts per million (ppm) to more than 400 ppm; 350 ppm or less is needed to limit the most severe consequences.Although technologies are emerging to remove the CO₂ that's already in the atmosphere, right now forests remain the only means for doing this at scale. By restoring forests on previously cleared and marginal areas in the tropics, we could remove half a gigaton of carbon from the atmosphere annually, more than the emissions of all cars in the United States combined.The more scientists look, the more we understand the innumerable values of tropical forests to people. Forests supply fresh water that irrigates crops and powers hydroelectric dams, even as they slow the torrents that cause some floods and mudslides. They directly support more than a billion people with fiber, shelter, food and livelihoods. They are the source of many of our most potent antibiotics and other medicines. And one in two species on the planet calls them home.The opportunities to harness tropical forests as nature's climate change solution are essential and immediately available, but disappearing. We must act now."

(Photo by Sam Greenwood/Getty Images for NASCAR)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8df591f00000002257792.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, announced on Tuesday that he would not seek to remove a photograph on display at a local museum or withdraw the museum's funding after the city council president called the image ""pornographic"" and asked him to do so.City Council President Clay Yarborough (R) took issue with a photograph at the Museum of Contemporary Art by Angela Strassheim of a nude pregnant woman reclining with her breasts exposed. Yarborough, who saw the image last week while walking through a public space in the museum, emailed the chief of staff for Mayor Alvin Brown (D) and requested the city revoke more than $200,000 in taxpayer funds given to the museum through cultural grants.""Given that any member of the public, including children of all ages can enter, and are in fact encouraged to do so, as City Council President I take great offense on behalf of the people of Jacksonville that the City would accept this,"" Yarborough wrote in an email that was provided to The Huffington Post. ""Unless Mayor Brown supports this inappropriate, pornographic display, and accepts that anyone, including children can enter and see it, I insist that you immediately cause to be pulled all funding designated for MOCA for the current fiscal year or otherwise explain how this will be addressed within 24 hours.""MOCA was awarded $233,029 this fiscal year from the Cultural Council of Greater Jacksonville, which allocates a small portion of the city's budget to more than 20 cultural institutions. In an email to The Huffington Post, Yarborough said he didn't think children should be compelled to see a nude photograph.""While all may differ on the definition of art, a more important issue is: should any person, especially a child, who enters the unrestricted lobby of a taxpayer-owned building have his or her rights violated by being forcibly exposed to this type of picture if they do not wish to see it?"" Yarborough said in the email. David DeCamp, a Brown spokesman, said that the MOCA building is owned by the city, but the museum itself is administered by the University of North Florida.Brown referred the matter to the city's office of general counsel, which told Yarborough that the city could not remove the artwork without violating the First Amendment. ""The museum and artist have First Amendment rights to exhibit artwork in a leased public space, even if it may offend some members of the public,"" Jason Gabriel, the city's general counsel, wrote on Tuesday in an email to Yarborough. ""While the city can choose to fund agencies or activities however it wishes (including those involving speech), it cannot discriminate or base its decisions on viewpoints with which it disagrees.""Citing that conclusion, Brown also told Yarborough in a letter on Tuesday that he would not remove any of the funds appropriated to MOCA.Cultural Council President Tony Allegretti -- who took his two young children to see the exhibit -- said that he was ""mystified over the complaint"" and was unsure of how exactly Yarborough or the city could revoke MOCA's funding. A rally in support of the museum's right to display the picture is scheduled for Wednesday evening.Strassheim, whose exhibit deals with the ""fleeting nature of adolescence,"" said she was shocked at the outcry over the picture.""To me it's a very tasteful photograph,"" Strassheim told The Huffington Post. ""It's not done in a gross, obscene way, so it is shocking to me that there's that much attention to this. But it is also by one man.""""To me the photograph is about this last bit of afternoon sunlight pouring in the window and her kind of embracing the warmth of that,"" she said. ""I'm surprised in 2014 that we're having an issue over breasts in a photograph.""Marcelle Polednik, the museum's director, told HuffPost that a museum ""anywhere in the world"" would have images of the nude body, which has long been a subject of art. ""Introducing children to the body is not something that should be shied away from. It demands a greater context. How many hundreds of thousands of children visit Michelangelo's David every year?"" Polednik said."

""I'm going to take responsibility for all my pain looking beautiful and all the things that I've made out of my strife. I did that.""As Gaga told Stern, she never confronted the man after the incident. ""I don't know how I would react. It would terrify me. It would paralyze me,"" she said.

(Photo by Mark Jay Goebel/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb66da33c000018010d4a41.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There was a time when ""home economics"" meant something other than the family budget. To young teens in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, it meant a school class where the girls were taught to cook and sew -- life skills for being homemakers -- and the boys learned to build things. The classes were generally segregated by gender, although social pressure eventually broke down that barrier. Everyone has a ""Home Ec"" story, whether it be all the unhealthy foods we were taught to make (be sure and slather butter on that bread before you make grilled cheese!) or simply the silliness of making an arrow-shaped tie rack. We asked our Huff/Post50 Facebook friends and others to share some of their favorite, albeit dated, Home Ec memories.For those of us who went to Maple Avenue Elementary School in Newark, N.J., the story was always Mrs. Steinberg, a lovely woman who taught her charges how to make Welsh Rarebit and sew aprons. This writer had her in 7th and 8th grades. Sandra Murgacz noted that she must have been in my class, because we remember all the same details. Mrs. Steinberg was missing several fingers (or at least one) -- which, without a single word spoken, motivated all the girls to be extremely careful around the sewing machine. As Murgacz noted, ""We never asked about her finger(s). We were kind. She was discreet.""In cooking, Murgacz recalls, ""we had to use a white candle to rub on our 3x5 (recipe) file cards to protect them."" (Note to self: Candle wax still works as a protectant.) Linda Bodzin Coppleson remembers making a potato and hard boiled egg casserole with Miss Livingston at Chancellor Ave. School, also in Newark, NJ. Our schools were always rivals and we all went to Weequahic High.Some of us took our Home Ec class more seriously than others. Joni Tucker Sherwood learned to make peanut brittle in Home Ec in 7th and 8th grade and still makes batches of it every Christmas. She writes, ""I have the original ditto recipe our teacher handed out. And my jumper…I don't have it, but boy do I remember how painful it was to make it. It had facing around the neck and armholes… Awful to stitch. What memories you've conjured up!""And Shockingly Delicious food blogger Dorothy Reinhold notes that she ""Got an A damn plus in Home Ec, baby!"" She said, ""I made the apron, I baked the banana bread, and then I went on to make clothing for myself based on those skills, and to use what I learned in the kitchen for my whole life!""Peggy Barrett said she still uses what she learned on a daily basis -- ""mostly how to set the table correctly. Haha."" Vivian Dobbins still remembers how to measure and read pattern directions carefully. She thanks Home Ec for teaching her how to take out seams and redo them when she doesn't follow those directions. ""Actually I learned a lot in Home-Ec,"" she said.But it was not universally loved. Louise Butler ""can still remember the order of dishes in the cupboard we were required to memorize, and the correct order to wash dishes."" She recalls being the only girl in the sewing class who had to wear clothes they hadn't made in the mandatory fashion show. Yeah, that bad.A bit more cynical was Ron Morse, who noted that ""Home Ec [was] where you got a degree in Domestic Engineering...haha."" Perhaps for some, Ron. But writes Mimi Broihier ""I learned the fine exact skill of baking brownies. They wouldn't let me take shop in junior high in the early 70s. In high school, I wanted to take auto shop and my Dad wouldn't let me. The school would also not let me be on stage crew for plays. I couldn't understand it.""Carole Nunes noted that when she was in school, ""girls were Home Ec and guys were shop."" Fond memories? Not exactly. ""I dreaded it!!' she said. ""However, I did learn a great stitch for hemming which has come in handy. I did learn to enjoy sewing though and sewed clothes for my daughters and myself. Wow. I guess I'm more domestic than I thought.""Betty Blatt tried to take shop class because she wanted ""to tear down & rebuild a car when in High School. The school principal would not allow girls in shop. Good grief! That was several moons ago. Ha! We made custards and aprons in Home Ec. I think that was all we did. Don't remember anything else! My custard was fine; apron was a mess!""Bonnie Forward noted that when she was in school, the class was not co-ed. Home Ec was where she ""learned to abhor sewing.""Sewing was hard for many of us. Rhonda Smith says she made her first yellow dress in this class ""and it was awful!""But times changed and Home Ec class along with it. Yvette Desmarais was able to take wood shop and still remembers the skills she learned there. Pamela Stock Newhart took both shop class AND home ec. Lori Jefferson Foster reports that they experimented with her 9th grade class. ""We all had to take 9 weeks each of sewing, cooking, wood shop and drafting. Can't say I remember much but it was fun."" "

As Democrats across the country make an election-year push to raise the minimum wage, they are also looking to motivate younger people, minorities and others in their base to go to the polls on Nov. 4th. The party has put questions on the ballot in five states asking voters whether the minimum wage should be increased. (AP Photo/M. Spencer Green, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6916f4230000c21a0c2500.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Chicago City Council moved hastily Tuesday to approve an ordinance calling for a $13 minimum wage for workers in the Windy City, the latest place where city officials are taking action to increase worker pay independent of statewide initiatives.The ordinance calls for the minimum wage in Chicago to rise from $8.25 to $10 an hour beginning next year, followed by increases to $10.50 in 2016, $11 in 2017, $12 in 2018 and, finally, $13 in 2019. Though five aldermen voted against the ordinance, 44 others backed it during the special Tuesday meeting of the council.The Raise Chicago Coalition, which had fought for the wage boost, called the vote ""a major victory."" “The passage of this increase will change the lives of hundreds of thousands of low wage workers and their families. It will have a tangible benefit for our communities, local economies and small businesses,"" Ann Marie Cunningham of Jane Addams Senior Caucus, part of the Raise Chicago group, said in a statement.The fast-tracked plan, one of three wage-increase proposals considered by city officials this week, is backed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel in what some critics say is a political move designed to win favor with left-leaning Chicago voters ahead of the February 2015 mayoral election.Emanuel applauded the city council's Tuesday vote in a statement. ""A higher minimum wage ensures that nobody who works in the City of Chicago will ever struggle to reach the middle class or be forced to raise their child in poverty,"" he said. ""Today, Chicago has shown that our City is behind a fair working wage.""The council’s 19-member Workplace Development and Audit Committee had approved the plan Monday, with only three “no” votes, despite business groups and a minority of aldermen -- including Ann Sather restaurants owner Tom Tunney -- saying the plan will kill jobs and hurt business in the city.""How do you go from $8.25 [an-hour] to $13 overnight?” Tunney said Tuesday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “You know what you do? You raise the prices and you've also got to find ways to do it with less help. That's what's going to happen.""Business groups including the Chicagoland Camber of Commerce and the Illinois Restaurant Association have also said the wage increase puts Chicago businesses at an unfair disadvantage, especially in parts of the city that border suburb towns in Illinois and communities in the neighboring state of Indiana.Some activist groups and Emanuel rivals gearing up for the mayoral race say the $13-an-hour wage is not enough and have vowed to continue to push for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, an amount that an overwhelming majority of Chicago voters approved via a non-binding ballot question in the March primary election.""While I’m proud to support today’s increase in the minimum wage, we can’t stop fighting now,"" Ald. Bob Fioretti, who is running for mayor, said in a Tuesday statement. ""Rahm Emanuel could’ve pushed this legislation earlier, and he could’ve pushed for $15 an hour today. The chant in the streets here and nationwide has been ‘show me $15,’ not ‘show me $13 by 2019.’""Cook County Commissioner Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia, who is also running for mayor, questioned why the Emanuel administration did not push for a higher wage sooner. Garcia also backed a proposed $15-an-hour Chicago wage.""Why didn't he support a minimum wage hike during his first year in office?"" Garcia said in a statement. ""Why does he want to wait another 5 years before raising everyone to $13 an hour?""In the November elections, a majority of Illinois voters cast ballots in favor of increasing the state minimum wage to $10 by 2015. Sixty-six percent of voters statewide approved the November ballot question, while 87 percent of Chicago voters voted in favor of the increase.Chicago’s move to increase its city minimum wage could have implications for the separate battle to boost the state minimum wage to $11 by 2017. As Crain’s Greg Hinz reported Monday, the backing of business groups which had supported the statewide proposal was likely contingent on the law blocking the ability of Chicago and other cities to independently increase their minimum wages above the state wage.The state minimum wage was a key issue in the state’s contentious gubernatorial race, and there is continued tension as Republican Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner has urged the state legislature to avoid taking action on any major issues, particularly raising the minimum wage, until he takes office on Jan. 12. Rauner, who is pushing for “pro-job creation, pro growth reforms,” such as changes to laws concerning workers compensation and state taxes in conjunction with a minimum wage increase, warned on Tuesday that the Chicago ordinance could make the city less competitive, the Chicago Tribune reports.Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn had vowed to increase the minimum wage in Illinois, and lawmakers may choose to ignore Rauner’s directive and approve such legislation during their fall veto session this week.Chicago is home to approximately 400,000 minimum-wage workers, who will be directly impacted by Tuesday's vote."

They have also engaged in four-and-a-half-minute ""die-ins"" (a minute for each hour that Brown's body lay in the street after he was killed) at the entrances of malls, major street intersections, and highway-access ramps.Regrettably, a majority (or at least a substantial number) of white adults either don't understand or are opposed to such demonstrations. ""Why are they doing this?"" they ask. ""This doesn't help their cause.""Years ago the author James Baldwin was being interview on television by David Susskind, the interviewer on a popular, syndicated late-night TV show. Susskind asked Baldwin, ""Jimmy, what is it that you and your people want?"" Baldwin leaned in close to Susskind and replied, ""David, whatever you and white people want I want.""White racism, a product of the doctrine of white supremacy and the legacy of slavery, remains a pernicious social disease afflicting white police officers operating in black communities nationwide. Race relations in America remain mired in ongoing, 24/7 hypocrisy.As Michael Eric Dyson recently wrote in The New York Times:Black and white people rarely view race in the same way or agree about how to resolve racial conflicts, and black people have furious moral debates among ourselves out of white earshot.As I wrote in my last blog post, after years of cumulative abuses by police in Ferguson and African-American communities nationwide, the ""cup of endurance"" has run over among most African Americans, especially parents of young black men killed by police. Continuing demonstrations in Ferguson and the words on the signs carried by demonstrators reflect this impatience. What is more powerful than a placard that reads, ""Black Lives Matter""?In that same blog post I wrote:The historic domestic and international accomplishments of the equally historic presidency of Barack Obama risk being overshadow and diminished by a perceived failure of his administration to substantively address the ticking time bomb of distrust between the police and young black men in our country today. So here's what I propose: The president and the attorney general should immediately convene a meeting at the White House of young black men and their representatives and the chiefs of police of most major urban communities to address this crisis head-on.Yesterday the president did just that and actually went even further, including leaders of various civil-rights organizations and young people from Ferguson in a meeting at the White House. All persons of good will seeking to address this critical issue of how police serve African-American communities should support and applaud the president's initiative.Similarly, I applaud my colleagues at the University of San Francisco for initiating a ""teach-in"" on the topic of Ferguson and the nationwide protests. Colleges and universities are the preeminent marketplace of ideas. Indeed, teach-ins addressing U.S. policy in Vietnam played a historic role in developing a domestic consensus to end the war. Hopefully other colleges and universities will follow the leadership of the University of San Francisco on shedding light and understanding on the issues raised by Ferguson and their potential role in enabling our country to be the very best that it can be.Yes, as Victor Hugo put it, ""more powerful than the march of mighty armies is an idea whose time has come."""
