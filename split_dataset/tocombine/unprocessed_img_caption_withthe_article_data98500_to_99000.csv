It's had the support of some in Congress. Now congressional leaders want to move on fast track, and soon. That means those standing up for the interests of hardworking Americans must step up their efforts. After all, not everyone is aware of the consequences that a quick up-or-down vote on the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal will bring. It will devastate not only wage earners, but their families as well.The Teamsters and our fair-trade friends have seen the damage fast track and bad trade deals like the TPP can do. President Obama in his State of the Union speech last week conceded as much. Millions of middle-class jobs nationwide have been lost, and they are not coming back. The theme of the President's State of the Union Speech was right on target -- it is time for all of our elected leaders to do everything within their power to support and expand the nation's middle class. It is for exactly this reason that the President and free trade supporters in Congress need to change their position on fast track.Supporters of trade agreements like to say that these agreements create U.S. jobs. But history shows otherwise. In fact, it would strike at the heart of the industry the president is lauded for helping save -- the automobile sector. Because the TPP does not address currency manipulation, other nations will drive up the cost of American goods while at the same time making their goods cheaper. Japan has specifically been called out for the practice and how it affects U.S. automakers. The good news is there is a strong bipartisan collection of lawmakers who, like the Teamsters, have made it clear fast track does not lead to fair trade. Repeatedly, they have written the U.S. Trade Representative, held press conferences and spoken out publicly about speeding trade deals through Congress. This approach will hurt hardworking Americans by shipping their jobs overseas and endangering their health with unsafe imported food and products. Further, removing congressional oversight of trade deals violates the U.S. constitution.Polling has shown that the public doesn't like fast track or the TPP when it discovers the details of both. But the battle is increasing education on the issue. That why the Teamsters, other unions and a coalition of environmental, food safety, health care and even Internet freedom groups plan on using the next few weeks to get the word out and contact lawmakers. We all must let workers know about the problems that would result from limiting debate and outlawing amendments on trade bills.With Congress set to consider fast track soon, there is no time to waste in letting both the public and elected officials know about the dangers of unfair trade. Less jobs, lower pay, less worker protections and unsafe food and products isn't good for anyone -- except big business.American workers are facing turbulent times. Corporations are trying to ship U.S. jobs overseas in an attempt to lower the wages they pay. Having seen the costs with the implementation of NAFTA, the Teamsters and their allies cannot let that happen. This nation doesn't need any more free trade agreements; it needs fair trade agreements. But that will only happen if pro-worker advocates stand up."

But in 2009, ""It hit me,"" says Page. ""My father had passed away, Andrew had lost both his parents -- all to cancer. We could no longer ignores the headlines we'd been reading."" Originally from the midwest, Page ""grew up thinking a meal wasn't a meal unless there was meat in it."" Dornenburg's first job? McDonald's. Here they are, six years on, celebrating Veganuary .Dornenburg's professional kitchen talents go far beyond the golden arches, which made the meatless transition easier.

""It's lighter on our system."" Turns out the Mexican restaurant they've been going to for 20 years has a meatless menu they hadn't even known about. ""We felt no sense of loss whatsoever."" And through interviewing vegan chefs for ""The Vegetarian Flavor Bible,"" Page, a flavor geek, ""came to realize meat isn't the heart of the flavor at all. It's in the vegetables and herbs and spices.""Page defines flavor as more than ""what takes place on your tongue There's taste, mouthfeel, aroma, and the X Factor,"" that hard-to-define something affecting all your senses and ""the heart, mind and spirit"", too. The X Factor is why your mother's spaghetti tastes better than Mario Batali's (although even Mario has embraced Meatless Monday. It was the X Factor that changed Page's mind about meat. She could no longer enjoy eating it knowing the health risks. And the more she learned about livestock production, the less appetizing it became.

Cadbury eggs will still be around, for example -- but now they'll taste slightly different because British-made Cadbury chocolate is produced under a different recipe (the first ingredient in U.K. Cadbury chocolate is milk, while the first in American-made Cadbury chocolate is sugar, according to the New York Times).

CNN reports Cadbury's Toffee Crisps are on the outs because their packaging too closely resembles that of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and Yorkie chocolate bars apparently sound a little too much like York Peppermint Patties. Hershey's spokesman Jeff Beckman told The Huffington Post that the agreement was necessary, saying, ""It is important for Hershey to protect its trademark rights and to prevent consumers from being confused or misled when they see a product name or product package that is confusingly similar to a Hershey name or trade dress...

But to say ""there is no one in government right now who has any market or finance experience"" is, to use the academic term, bonkers sauce. You don't need to look further than the guy who runs the Treasury, Jack Lew, who was formerly the chief operating officer of CitiGroup's Alternative Investment prop-trading unit, where he had something of a storied history.Let's do look further, though! Your Federal Reserve governing board has several members who, I'm guessing, would love to throttle Mr. or Ms. Anonymous Source for the above quote -- most notably Federal Reserve Governors Jerome Powell (Carlyle Group), Stanley Fischer (CitiGroup) and Lael Brainard (McKinsey). Throughout the regulatory landscape you'll find a slew of top officials who very well might take umbrage at Anonymous McSourcy's version of events. Many of these people are former law partners whose clients were definitely under the impression that they knew their way around markets and investments. Like, say, SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar (partner at McKenna Long & Aldridge), CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad (partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore) and CFTC Commissioner Sharon Y. Bowen (partner at Latham & Watkins). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has its own murderers' row of leaders who can make the same boast.Heck, in CFTC Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo, we find a guy who successfully managed to get the private sector windfall for which Weiss was angling. As Bloomberg News' Robert Schmidt reported last week:In moving from the private sector to government, the newest Republican member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has acquired potential conflicts that ethics lawyers say could force him to stay away from matters involving major companies regulated by the agency.Someone better tell this anonymous source that ""Bloomberg News"" is this whole news agency that, like, people can read for free and find out what's going on, and whatnot.At any rate, I'm guessing it wouldn't be ""wrath"" that this anonymous person would earn from Elizabeth Warren, but rather ""pity.""

Away from human buzz, we're able to get in touch with ourselves while truly getting away. So apparently, we should head to this single square inch of land in Olympic National Park -- it's known as the quietest place in America. Back in the 80s, acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton began a mission to find the quietest places in the U.S. -- armed with a tape recorder, he looked for places where he could record a whole tape's worth of sound without one human interruption from noises like planes, voices or cars. By the early 90s, he had concluded there were less than 12 of these ""quiet places"" in the entire lower 48 states. And one of them is inside Olympic National Park. The park is on Washington's northwest coast, draped in rainforest and stretching from wooded mountains all the way to ocean tide pools. It's known as a majestic place for both hidden beaches and glacier hikes. To keep this place ultra-quiet, Hempton launched One Square Inch, in which he makes extreme efforts to protect one especially quiet inch of the park, a particular spot on the forested Hoh River Trail. Hempton has put in requests to airlines, asking that they re-route planes away from this inch of land to preserve its quietness. The theory is that by protecting this single inch of space from noise pollution, he'll end up saving large areas around it -- potentially the whole park -- as a result. To get to ""One Square Inch,"" aka the quietest place in America, visit Olympic National Park and head to the Visitor Center at Hoh Rain Forest. Take an approximately two-hour hike among ancient ferns to a mossy log, located at precisely 47° 51.959N and 123° 52.221W.

These shallower price losses were part of the reason why the gasoline price drop was less steep this week and contributed to the gains in wholesale prices.On Friday, Brent crude closed up at $48.79 a barrel, while U.S. crude settled down 72 cents at $45.59.The highest price within the survey area in the 48 contiguous U.S. states was recorded in San Francisco at $2.54 per gallon, with the lowest in Albuquerque, New Mexico at $1.73.

The issue of a foreign head of state addressing a joint meeting of Congress is not in itself a huge deal. This would be the 115th time it occurred and would be Netanyahu's third appearance before the body.What is a big deal, however, is that Prime Minister Netanyahu actively sought, and Speaker Boehner extended, the invitation entirely behind the administration's back to permit Netanyahu to advocate harsher sanctions against Iran that the administration (and even Mossad) opposes while a final resolution with Iran is being negotiated. Even worse, the date selected (March 3) is only two weeks before Israel's election, so the administration will not be able to meet with Netanyahu due to longstanding policy of not meeting with foreign leaders too close to their election so as not to be seen as interfering.As an administration official explained privately, ""there are things you simply don't do. He spat in our face publicly and that's no way to behave."" Welcome to the Unbearable Rudeness of Bibi.When American Presidents speak of Israel, it is often expressing sentiments similar to President Clinton's when he said, ""America and Israel share a special bond. Our relations are unique among all nations.""When Prime Minister Netanyahu speaks of the United States, however, it is to say that ""American policy in the Middle East is based on lies and distortions"" or to boast that America is easily manipulated and moved ""in the right direction [so] they won't get in the way."" He has also bragged about double-crossing President Clinton by reluctantly agreeing to adhere the Oslo accords but then taking measures to render it meaningless.Secretary of State James Baker temporarily banned then-Deputy Foreign Minister Netanyahu from the State Department for his ""lies and distortions comments,"" while Netanyahu's manipulation comments only prove President Clinton's initial impression after meeting with the new Prime Minister in which he said ""[h]e thinks he is the superpower, and we are here to do whatever he requires."" (Further supporting Clinton's assessment was the recent statement of one of Netanyahu's cabinet members who told the U.S. ambassador that Israel expects ""unconditional"" support ""even when you think we're wrong."")Time and time again, Netanyahu has shown little respect for American presidents, institutions or interests despite the fact that we provide Israel with over $3 billion in aid annually, use our diplomatic capital to block anti-Israeli measures at the United Nations and have had to endure a devastating oil embargo and terrorist attacks at home and abroad because of our support for Israel.In 2010, Netanyahu announced the expansion of new settlements in occupied East Jerusalem on the same day that Vice President Joe Biden arrived to restart the peace process (ignoring the U.S.' request to to implement a settlement freeze as part of the resumption of peace talks with the Palestinians). Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the announcement as an insult, while Vice President Biden privately scolded Netanyahu that he was ""undermin[ing] the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.""Netanyahu has lectured the President in front of the White House press corps and compared the administration's refusal to set a firm deadline for Iran to act on its nuclear program or face military action to the Roosevelt's administration rejecting calls from Jewish leaders to bomb Auschwitz.He also has shown little reluctance about meddling in American politics. In 1998, when President Clinton was pushing Netanyahu to fulfill Israel's obligations under the Oslo accords, Netanyahu made a point of starting his U.S. tour by meeting with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and appearing at a political rally with Rev. Jerry Falwell (who at the time was selling a videotape called ""The Clinton Chronicles,'' which accused the President of having been a narcotics dealer and user and involved in the death of Vincent Foster).In 2012, Netanyahu was criticized in both Israel and the U.S. for actively supporting Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Romney and Netanyahu shared political consultants and Netanyahu's attempts to escalate the situation in Iran during the fall campaign were quickly translated into Romney attack ads in the final days of the campaign.Less than a month before the 2014 midterm elections, Netanyahu appeared on CBS' Face the Nation and charged that he was ""baffled"" by President Obama's opposition to expansion of settlements in the Occupied Territories, a position he said was ""against American values."" Haaretz, Israel's leading English newspaper, called the comments a ""stink bomb"" and condemned Netanyahu for playing the partisan during our election season when he ""slammed the president as if he was a Tea Party brawler rather than the leader of a country with a 'special relationship' with America.""Netanyahu's comments also were a flat out lie, since every President since the 1967 War, from President Johnson to President Obama, has expressed opposition to expansion of the settlements in the Occupied Territories.Netanyahu latest stunt seeks to fuel claims that President Obama is not ""pro-Israel,"" an astounding charge since former Defense Secretary Gates, who served under three Republican Presidents and Obama once reminded Netanyahu that ""no U.S. administration had done more, in concrete ways, for Israel's strategic defense than Obama's"" (a view shared by former Prime Ministers Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak). For Netanyahu to disrespect the United States just after Secretary of State Kerry had called nearly 50 head of state to head off action against Israel at the United Nations is astounding. Waterboys are treated with more respect than that.Maybe the better question is whether Netanyahu is a friend of the United States? In words and deed he clearly is not. As an American, I am deeply offended that a nation that we have given so much to and sacrificed for would show such a total lack of respect to our President. I am also appalled that so-called ""loyal opposition"" leaders were complicit in this scheme. Sadly, Republicans seem elated to see a foreign leader spit in the face of the United States (so much for ""politics ending at the water's edge"").Israelis also are outraged since Netanyahu is alienating Israel's most important ally to salvage his reelection chances. As one Israeli columnist noted, the relationship between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States is ""the greatest strategic asset that Israel has had since its establishment"" and Netanyahu has ""irresponsibly"" ""destroyed"" that relationship. Israeli voters may have the final say on this issue, since with Netanyahu running behind in the polls, they may send Bibi to a well-deserved retirement.He will not be missed."

(Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cf834092100004011e6b349.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maybe this is an Oscar race after all: At Saturday night's Producers Guild of America Awards, ""Birdman"" producers Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, John Lesher and James W. Skotchdopole won the Darryl F. Zanuck Award for best movie, topping Best Picture favorite ""Boyhood,"" among other Oscar nominees, for the honor.Why is this significant? Recent history, for one: Since 2007, when ""No Country for Old Men"" won at the Producers Guild Awards, the guild's top award winner has matched the Oscars' Best Picture choice every time. (Last year, ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Gravity"" tied at the PGA Awards, giving the group a somewhat unfair statistical advantage.) In its history, the PGA Awards has successfully predicted the eventual Best Picture winner 18 of 25 times.The PGA Awards are also 2015's first major guild awards, making it the first time people in the industry (many of whom are also Academy members) have voted on this year's awards contenders. (Previous awards shows -- such as the Critics' Choice Awards and Golden Globes, both spots where ""Boyhood"" triumphed -- were voted on by media members.) That ""Birdman"" was chosen perhaps shows voters' hand a bit: It's a movie about the industry itself, and recent PGA Award and Best Picture winners ""The Artist"" and ""Argo"" were also about the power of Hollywood. As Grantland and Entertainment Weekly writer Mark Harris tweeted:""Birdman"" and ""Boyhood"" will battle again on Sunday night, when the Screen Actors Guild Awards are handed out. Both films are nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture (the SAG Awards' equivalent of Best Picture). The 87th annual Academy Awards are set for Feb. 22."

The talent show that is a presidential campaign began in earnest Saturday as more than 1,200 Republican activists, who probably will vote in Iowa's caucuses, packed into a historic Des Moines theater to see and hear from a parade of their party's prospective entries. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e5af1f00004002257962.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) walked out on stage at the Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday and resoundingly rejected the ""conventional wisdom"" that his East Coast style doesn't play in the heartland.""If I was too blunt, too direct, too loud and too New Jersey for Iowa, then why do you people keep inviting me back?"" Christie asked. He pointed to his warm relationship with the event's organizer, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), whom the governor described as ""a good friend.""Christie's remarks closed out a long day of speeches at the cattle call for conservative White House hopefuls, which also featured Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R). Christie has faced questions about his ability to connect with social conservatives, who are crucial to winning the early Iowa caucuses. His straight-talk, no-nonsense image has won him many fans at home, but the act can come across as grating to those hearing him for the first time. He sought to soothe such concerns on Saturday by doing what he does best -- being blunt.""Being honest with the people you hope to represent about the feelings you hold deeply is never, ever a political liability, and I will never change doing it exactly that way,"" he said, touting his anti-abortion record in the blue state of New Jersey.Christie didn't receive nearly the amount of applause or adoration thrown at the conservative firebrands who spoke before him. But he did win over at least a few audience members, who said they didn't mind Christie's brash style.""What's more important is the ideas and the way they're implemented,"" said Iowa retiree Daniel Reneker. ""We have livestock out here we have to shout at once in a while.""""I've always liked that Christie's the type of guy he is,"" said Des Moines resident George Freeland.""He says the same thing most of the time, but I just like where he's going and I like where he's been. He's kind of proven,"" added Susan Heun, a member of the Iowa Republican Party's central committee.The governor also received a rare vote of confidence from Erick Erickson, a prominent social conservative and editor of RedState.com, who tweeted that he found Christie's address to be ""really solid and impressive.""Nick Ryan, an Iowa-based Republican strategist, said that Christie's reputation is both a boon to his presidential prospects and a potential liability during a long campaign.""The biggest thing that he has going for him is his reputation. But it’s quite possibly his biggest liability. He is known because has been brash. He’s blunt. That’s why he’s been interesting. He’s been newsworthy,"" Ryan said.Christie faces a litany of other challenges as well. His popularity in his home state is at the lowest levels he has ever seen, driven down by criticism that he is neglecting New Jersey with frequent fundraising trips out-of-state as chair of the Republican Governors Association and persistently gloomy economic headlines about the shaky state of New Jersey's finances. Also not forgotten by future Iowa caucus voters is Christie's alleged involvement in the George Washington Bridge scandal.""I don't know if I want his hand on the red button if he's willing to shut down the whole bridge,"" said Ben Unander, an Illinois resident who supports famed neurosurgeon and rising conservative star Ben Carson. ""He says he didn't, but come on, if you have a staff full of people, you need to know what they're doing. Ultimately I think he's responsible."""
16,ENTERTAINMENT,Lena Dunham Dings Woody Allen,Sasha Bronner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lena-dunham-woody-allen_n_6539584.html,,2015-01-25,"PARK CITY, UT - JANUARY 24: (L-R) Mindy Kaling, Lena Dunham and Jenji Kohan appear onstage at the Power Of Story Panel: Serious Ladies during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival at the Egyptian Theatre on January 24, 2015 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Sonia Recchia/Getty Images for Sundance)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb49f6d2100002501c8136b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“America is at its most puritanical,” Lena Dunham proclaimed to a group of (mostly female) patrons at a Sundance panel discussion on Saturday afternoon. ""People are forgetting that humor is a tool for debate and a tool for expression.""The panel, moderated by New Yorker critic Emily Nussbaum, was titled ""Power of Story: Serious Ladies"" and featured four women who have become some of the most powerful forces in comedy over the last five years: Lena Dunham (""Girls""), Mindy Kaling (""The Mindy Project,"" ""The Office""), Kristen Wiig (""Bridesmaids,"" ""Saturday Night Live""), Jenji Kohan (""Orange Is the New Black,"" ""Weeds"").Maybe as a result, the initial conversation was tight-lipped. Dunham teased they were now all too seasoned to fall for ""gotcha"" questions -- like when Nussbaum asked what jokes they've cut from their shows for being over the line -- and that perhaps each woman was just too media-trained now. But that didn't stop her from making one buzzy comment about Woody Allen.The panel had just discussed how fans often assume Dunham and Kaling are just like the characters they write or play. (Wiig joked that if she were anything like the characters she plays, she would be ""really fucked up."") They agreed that male artists deal with this less, and Dunham decided to push the conversation further. Saying she doubts that people like Woody Allen and Larry David walk around being mistaken for the characters they play, Dunham stated: ""Woody Allen is proof that people don’t think that everything he does in his films is stuff that he does. Because all he was doing was making out with 17-year-old girls for years and we didn’t say a word about it. And then he did it. A bunch. No one went, 'Oh, Woody Allen is making out with a 17-year-old in ""Manhattan""; I guess he’s a real perv.' And then lo and behold ...""After that, the room was more alive, but the general questions about being female powerhouses came and went, as did queries about if film or television is the better landscape for women at the moment. But each woman on the panel had a chance to discuss what political issue was most important to her.After muttering under her breath that it was going to sound stupid, Wiig was first to answer the question. ""I think it's important to know where your food comes from. The food in schools right now is the worst. The grade of meat they allow is below what supermarkets allow. I think it's terrible and it affects how we learn and it affects our health. Our health is our lives.""Kohan, whose show ""Orange Is The New Black"" is known for challenging our perceptions of gender and sexuality, stated, “Something I find myself railing against is fundamentalism in all its forms.""Dunham spoke out about reproductive rights and justice. ""The idea that this is still something that women, in what I supposed to be the freest nation, are still fighting for every single day. And it's not just a political issue -- it's also a lot about class and race -- it is a part of all of these other forms of inequality and injustice in our country.""She also commended the Sundance documentary ""The Hunting Ground,"" which focuses on the issue of campus rape. ""Women on college campuses are some of the most privileged women with the loudest platforms to tell their stories,"" she said. ""Most of them are middle class and white. And they still can't be heard as survivors of sexual assault. So think about what that means. That is indicative of the fact that sexual assault is an epidemic and so many people are voiceless.""Pointing out that she realizes focusing only on campuses is ignoring so much other sexual assault in the nation, Dunham clarified, ""I think campuses are a great place to start because that is where we are being educated and where we are told we are going to be safe.""Kaling was also concerned with a female issue. ""So many girls who look up to me are young women of color who have been told that they are ugly,"" she said. ""They feel that they are not normal. I think it's so important for us to help illuminate that they can be beautiful and objects of love and attention and affection. I feel sad when people say, 'You are the first person who made me feel that that is possible.'""Fans can watch the entire panel below:"
