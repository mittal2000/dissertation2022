Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/perfect-arrangement-off-broadway_us_56129a17e4b0dd85030c9a1a,"Because ""everybody knows what it's like to have a secret.""",2015-10-06,"Christopher J. Hanke (left) and Robert Eli star in ""Perfect Arrangement,"" which opens Oct. 15. <br><br>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5613dabd1600002d00038208.jpeg?cache=vMuQ2Eb2WC&ops=crop_0_29_478_374%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Broadway and television actor Christopher J. Hanke sees his new theatrical project, ""Perfect Arrangement,"" as an opportunity to ""dive into a scary moment in [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] history"" that was well before his time.Still, Hanke is quick to clarify that the play, which opens at the Duke on 42nd Street in New York on Oct. 15 and is being produced by Primary Stages, is very much an ensemble comedy that offers ""tons of laughs."" Written by Topher Payne, ""Perfect Arrangement"" follows Bob Martindale (played by Robert Eli) and Norma Baxter (Julia Coffey) two U.S. State Department employees who are tasked with identifying ""sexual deviants"" within their ranks during the ""Lavender Scare,"" the years between 1945 and 1969 when homosexuality was grounds for dismissal from the federal government. The twist? Bob and Norma are both in sham marriages to hide the fact that they, too, are gay.""When people have secrets that they're trying to cover up, there's great comedy in that,"" Hanke, who plays a straight-laced, married schoolteacher who happens to be Bob's secret lover, told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""The way that these characters find themselves trying to spin those plates is very, very delightful to see.""The show also marks Payne's New York debut. Produced last year in Atlanta, ""Perfect Arrangement"" is giving the playwright, who has penned more than a dozen plays, a chance to ""sneak a little social agenda"" into an Off-Broadway comedy with a 1950s sitcom feel.""I'm always intrigued by the moment just before extraordinary social change happens, either for the positive or negative, and when you can attach a human experience to a social issue, really wonderful things can happen,"" he said. The ultimate goal of ""Perfect Arrangement"" is to ""get people laughing, so that you can then engage in a conversation about something that matters.""Calling the show ""a non-stop carnival of delight,"" director Michael Barakiva felt similarly, and believes ""Arrangement"" will resonate with both LGBT and heterosexual audiences because ""everybody knows what it's like to have a secret.""Best known for the 2011 Broadway revival of ""How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying,"" Hanke is no stranger to tackling modern gay roles, having recently starred as a sassy Hollywood hopeful who lands a job working for Barbra Streisand in the Off-Broadway solo comedy ""Buyer and Cellar."" While he's quick to tout the social progress the LGBT community has enjoyed, Hanke hopes theatergoers will walk away from the show with their ""eyes opened.""""I think that people will be able to see that the words, verbiage, attitudes and finger-pointing [that took place during the Lavender Scare] sound pretty similar to the words, verbiage, attitudes and finger-pointing that happens today,"" he said. ""To show them a little piece of American history that's not pretty to see is really awesome as an actor.""Sounds like a must-see to us!Currently in previews, the Primary Stages production of ""Perfect Arrangement"" opens Oct. 15 at The Duke on 42nd Street in New York.

""All told these 358 companies maintain at least 7,622 tax haven subsidiaries.""Fortune 500 companies hold more than $2.1 trillion in accumulated profits offshore to avoid taxes, with just 30 of the firms accounting for $1.4 trillion of that amount, or 65 percent, the study found.Fifty-seven of the companies disclosed that they would expect to pay a combined $184.4 billion in additional U.S. taxes if their profits were not held offshore. Their filings indicated they were paying about 6 percent in taxes overseas, compared to a 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate, it said.""Congress can and should take strong action to prevent corporations from using offshore tax havens, which in turn would restore basic fairness to the tax system, reduce the deficit and improve the functioning of markets,"" the study concluded."

""I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.'""Skip to 0:25 in the video above to hear Carson describe what he would have done if he'd been present at the shooting.Christopher Harper-Mercer, who killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, last week, had six guns with him at the school (and seven more at home). Witnesses said that Harper-Mercer asked some of the victims to state their religion -- and that they likely did so in hopes that he would spare their lives -- but he reportedly killed them no matter what they answered. Notwithstanding Carson's claim that the UCC victims just ""let"" Harper-Mercer shoot them, Army veteran Chris Mintz did fight back. Harper-Mercer shot Mintz seven times. Mintz survived, but is still recovering from his wounds.Carson also criticized President Barack Obama for saying last week that shootings should be politicized so that politicians will actually take action to address gun violence. ""When do we get to the point where we have people who actually want to solve our problems rather than just politicize everything?"" Carson said. ""I think that’s what the American people are so sick and tired of.""Carson also went on Facebook on Monday night and said the Oregon shooting hadn't changed his position against increased restrictions on gun ownership, because he ""never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.""

4,POLITICS,Here's How Hillary Clinton Does In A Head To Head Matchup With Elizabeth Warren,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-other-democrats-2016_us_5613fefce4b0368a1a613a47,A new poll also predicts how Clinton would do against other big Democratic names.,2015-10-06,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talk on Jan. 24, 2013. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5613ffcb1600002d000382aa.jpeg?ops=crop_0_46_3000_1646%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic primary voters still prefer former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, even when they're given the option of picking a fantasy candidate like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) instead.That's the takeaway from a new poll conducted by the liberal-leaning Public Policy Polling that was released on Tuesday. When the polling firm threw a bunch of names into the mix of primary candidates -- such as Warren, former Vice President Al Gore, former Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and Secretary of State John Kerry -- Democratic voters stuck with Clinton. Warren, Gore, Kerry and Dukakis are not actually running, but their names have been tossed out -- sometimes jokingly -- as an expression of some Democrats' desire to add more intrigue and Clinton alternatives to the primary contest. In a head to head matchup, Clinton leads Warren 58 percent to 28 percent, with 14 percent undecided. However, the Massachusetts senator still faces elatively low name recognition. Fifty-one percent of respondents had a favorable view of Warren and 18 percent had an unfavorable view, but 31 percent were unsure. Clinton holds much larger leads against Kerry and Gore. The one figure in the poll who isn't currently running but may shake things up is Vice President Joe Biden, who is rumored to be close to making a decision about whether he will enter the race. The PPP poll finds Clinton leading Biden 51 percent to 38 percent in a head to head matchup. And, in an overall survey that adds Biden to the current Democratic primary field, Clinton earns 42 percent to Biden's 20 percent, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) taking second place with 24 percent. However, as PPP notes, Biden voters tend to pick Clinton, rather than Sanders, as their second choice -- illustrating that a run by the vice president could end up helping Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, by splitting the vote of Democrats who are looking for more of a centrist, establishment figure. If Biden doesn’t get into the race, Clinton leads Sanders 51 percent to 28 percent.With all of the candidates, including the fantasy ones, thrown into the field, Clinton still gets 37 percent to Sanders' 19 percent and Warren's 11 percent. Even combining their support, Clinton would lead them 37-30.The PPP poll surveyed 551 Democratic primary voters between Oct. 1 and 4 and has a margin of error of 4.2 percent.

5,IMPACT,Many Refugees Can’t Afford Menstrual Protection. This Woman Is Helping To Fix That,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-refugees-in-jordan-can-now-make-a-living-by-making-menstrual-pads_us_5610e44de4b0af3706e11965,Families' weekly $10-stipend can't cover sanitary pads.,2015-10-06,Egyptian Billionaire Offers To Build Island For Refugees,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560593941b00004c0005d5d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"For many women refugees in Jordan who are struggling to just buy food and clothes, purchasing sanitary pads is a luxury they simply can’t afford -- a tradeoff that leads to discomfort, indignity and infections.But a simple innovation will enable women there to cheaply produce pads and make a living doing so.About 40,000 women and girls live in the Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan. They subsist on a $10 week allowance distributed by the U.N. and though coupons help with buying basics at local stores, they can’t be used to purchase sanitary pads, according to Rescue.org. Amy Peake, founder of Loving Humanity, is now disrupting that system.Since leaving her family behind in England, Peake has been working to improve the lives of Syrian refugees and is currently replicating a model from India that will allow women to make their own sanitary pads and sell them, the Indian Express reported. Peake is preparing to ship 12 machines, and the raw material required, to set up the operation.One machine costs 1,300 British pounds (about $2,000) employs up to 10 women, according to Loving Humanity. The system was first developed by Arunachalam Muruganantham, an Indian man who became determined in the late '90s to invent an affordable sanitary pad after he learned that his wife, and many other low-income women in rural areas, were using dirty cloths and other unhygienic materials when they menstruated. After four and a half years, Muruganantham found that he could produce a pad by breaking down the cellulose from the bark of a tree. He also invented the machinery to produce the pads that won a national innovation award and that is now being operated by underserved women in need of a sustainable livelihood, BBC reported.Muruganantham was initially met with skepticism, but that didn’t stop his innovation from taking off. His machines have spread to 1,300 villages in 23 states in India. That included grabbing the attention of Swati Bedeker, founder of the Vatsalya Foundation. After discovering that girls often skip schools when they menstruate because they don’t have access to pads, or just use unsafe protection, Bedeker researched a number of solutions and decided to follow Muruganantham’s method, the Better India reported.Five units produce 1 million napkins per month and each pack of 10 sanitary pads is sold for 20 Indian rupees, about 30 cents. Peake found out about the concept from the Vatsalya Foundation and hopes to introduce the model to Jordan’s female refugees in the next few months.She told the Indian Express that she hopes to “improve menstrual sanitation” and also empower at least 50 families as it brings in money through employment.Also on HuffPost:"

Up to 20 families, roughly 70 to 80 people, are expected to have reached the town by early 2016.Under a local Catholic initiative called Echo 65 run by retired soldier Pascal Vigneron, the refugees stay with Amer and Nahren at first before being sent to other homes in the parish.“[It provides] an opportunity for them to acclimatize and get some explanations about France,” said Vigneron.Youssif wants to get a job and send his sons to university in France but that may prove difficult. Of the 60 Iraqis now in Lourdes only one is employed, partly due to high unemployment in the region and to their lack of French language skills.Vigneron said many of the Iraqis also showed little desire to find work.“They said to us, a job?

Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) is chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of Texas businesses and their local representatives last week urged Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) to reconsider his opposition to a government export program the group argues helps U.S. businesses sell products overseas and creates American jobs.Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, is among the leaders of a movement in Washington to kill the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Like similar conservative Republicans, Hensarling argues that the export bank amounts to ""crony capitalism,"" in which a handpicked few with government connections are able to use scarce taxpayer resources to get an advantage over their less-connected competitors.The export lender backs loans and gives other guarantees to help U.S. businesses sell their wares to foreign buyers. Big corporations, such as Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., are among its biggest beneficiaries, further inflaming opponents such as Hensarling, who claim that the bank generally helps politically connected corporate interests rather than all U.S. exporters.Hensarling's opposition helped derail the export lender by causing its authority to strike new deals to expire on June 30, following congressional inaction. The export-focused government lender had generally been supported by wide majorities of both Democrats and Republicans.In their Wednesday letter, Texas business groups and small businesses told Hensarling that his opposition to the bank had cost his home state an unspecified number of jobs.""[C]ountless exporters have come forward with stories about lost sales and opportunities directly related to their inability to access Ex-Im financing,"" the group said in its letter.

The seat he fills has been empty for 1,069 days and is a judicial emergency, meaning the workload exceeds 600 cases or has totaled between 430 and 600 cases for more than 18 months.Drozd was easily confirmed, yet he waited 327 days for a vote. Why? Because Republicans are intentionally slow-walking President Barack Obama's judicial nominees. Many are hoping to hold out until 2017, when a Republican may be in the White House and could fill out the federal bench with GOP-picked nominees. In the meantime, nominees aren't getting confirmed, courts are getting backed up for years and judges are burning out.Judge Lawrence O'Neill may be the happiest person of all about Drozd's confirmation. He serves on the busy Fresno court that Drozd now joins. In an interview with The Huffington Post last month, O'Neill described the work schedule he keeps in order to juggle his more than 1,000 cases: 75-hour weeks, at least one full day every weekend and no breaks on holidays.He credits the media for keeping pressure on the Senate not to blow off the entire judicial branch of government.""Credit is given where credit is due,"" O'Neill said Monday. ""The confirmation of Judge Drozd shows that the U.S. Senate acted because they heard and recognized the truth of the serious issues voiced by the judges of this District by way of a responsible and concerned media. The Senate's action today is more than appreciated by our judges, but the true beneficiaries are members of the public who need to use the Federal Courts.""There are 67 court vacancies left to fill. More than 30 have nominees pending in the Senate, and 10 of those nominees are ready for a confirmation vote. No votes have been scheduled.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) urged Republicans to approach judicial confirmations the way he did when he chaired the Judiciary Committee under President George W. Bush. By this point in Bush's seventh year, Democrats had confirmed 33 of his judicial picks. Republicans have only confirmed seven of Obama's judicial nominees this year, including Drozd.""I wanted to set different patterns. I wanted to take the confirmation of judges, at least, out of politics,"" Leahy said on the Senate floor. ""Well, it went back to the same old, same old. … Let's stop this obstruction."""

12,POLITICS,Obama's Democratic Trade Critics Pin Their Hopes On The GOP Primary,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-trans-pacific-partnership_us_5612abcfe4b0af3706e17696,Progressives will need Republicans to defeat the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,2015-10-05,The Obama administration says it has secured terms for the TPP.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5612ad951800002d00dc128a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Monday announced that it had sealed the biggest trade deal in history. Sorta. The actual text of the agreement hasn't been released. Some final details may or may not remain up in the air, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative can't say when they'll be available.The agency has, however, released a fact-sheet laying out the broad terms of the deal, which remain largely in line with what Democratic critics have long expected. Congressional Democrats still loathe the agreement between the United States and 11 Pacific nations, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and key Republican leaders didn't exactly celebrate the administration's announcement.""I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said in a written statement. Hatch, who heads the committee responsible for trade deals, is Obama's top TPP ally in the Senate.House Ways and Means Committee Chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) -- who also leads a panel that oversees trade -- said in a statement that he is ""reserving judgment"" and has ""concerns surrounding the most recent aspects of the agreement."" The battle lines on TPP have been clear for years. Environmental groups and public health experts have lobbied fiercely against the pact, arguing that it will empower big corporations to undermine important regulations before international trade courts and drive up prescription drug prices. Labor unions say the pact will offshore U.S. jobs to low-wage countries with poor human rights records, such as Vietnam and Malaysia. Corporate lobbying groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly support the TPP, arguing it will boost American exports. In June, Congress granted Obama so-called ""fast track powers"" on trade, which bars legislators from amending or filibustering the final agreement, making it far easier for TPP to pass. But the margin in the House was very narrow -- one vote shy of defeat -- giving opponents some hope that the final terms will peel off enough lawmakers to kill the deal, which must still pass both chambers of Congress.The politics of the 2016 presidential primaries will help that cause, as will the resignation of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) -- a strong TPP supporter -- at the end of October.Democratic opposition to TPP has already created headaches for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has avoided taking a position on the pact, saying she is waiting to see the final terms of the deal. In her book Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that she opposes key provisions included in the pact. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been running a strong primary campaign for the 2016 nomination, has been unequivocally against the TPP for years. He blasted the administration's announcement on Monday.""Wall Street and big corporations have won again,"" Sanders said. ""In the Senate, I will do all that I can to defeat this agreement.""But Obama has the Senate sewn up. There are a handful of House Democrats who voted for the fast-track bill that may flip. Oddly, however, it's the Republican side of the aisle where progressives have the best opportunity to pick up votes. The ""most recent aspects of the agreement"" Ryan referenced in his statement are small concessions that the administration reportedly made to progressive voices. Ambassador Michael Froman proposed removing anti-smoking rules from the sets of regulations that can be challenged before international tribunals. Froman also backed down from efforts to secure 12 years of monopoly protections for cancer drugs, according to sources familiar with the talks. None of these changes mollified Democrats in Congress. But they have angered some Republicans, and give anyone interested in changing positions an excuse to move. Trade is a contentious issue in the Republican base. Many conservative groups vehemently oppose TPP, and Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has been fanning those flames. He's called TPP a ""disaster"" and appeared in a radio ad hammering the ""bad, bad deal."" Trump has targeted the agreement's failure to tackle currency manipulation by Japan as a chief failure. Currency manipulation allows governments to make their goods cheaper in foreign markets without damaging wages or living standards for their own workers. It is one of the few issues to fracture TPP's corporate coalition, generating outrage from American auto companies. On Monday, Ford issued a statement opposing the deal.""We recommend Congress not approve TPP in its current form, and ask the Administration to renegotiate TPP and incorporate strong and enforceable currency rules,"" Ford lobbyist Ziad Ojakli said.But while TPP's political vulnerabilities are principally among Republicans, the Obama administration is already making a largely progressive sales pitch for the deal, touting protections for wildlife and enforceable labor standards. Environmental groups and unions have been largely unimpressed, noting that the administration hasn't really enforced such rules in existing trade pacts. The Sierra Club and other groups have noted that the environmental chapter the administration touts doesn't address climate change.It will be months, however, before Congress actually votes on TPP. Obama has to give Congress 90 days notice before signing the pact, and give them 60 days to review a public text. Most experts expect a vote in February, at the earliest, which would place the vote right in the midst of 2016 primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.On a Monday conference call with reporters, Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said that scheduling could only help their efforts to defeat the pact.""That's perfect timing,"" DeLauro said."

Though Salem Media Group -- which bought RedState last year -- hasn't publicly commented on Erickson's status, there have been signs his tenure as editor (and the public face of the site) was coming to an end. Word that Erickson might leave RedState first surfaced in the kicker to an August profile pegged to RedState's annual conference, which featured nine Republican candidates.The Huffington Post reported last month that Erickson would not be part of Salem's extensive Republican debate coverage, which included top writers from other sites it owns, such as Townhall and HotAir. Erickson has increasingly focused on his radio career with Cox Media Group, a Salem rival, and appeared on their airwaves during debate night. Jonathan Garthwaite, vice president and general manager of Townhall Media, part of Salem Media Group, acknowledged Erickson's coming departure in a memo obtained by The Huffington Post.""As a few of you know, Erick Erickson will be transitioning out of his role as Editor of RedState this Fall to focus more on his Atlanta radio show and other projects,"" Garthwaite wrote.""RedState has been a labor of love of Erick's for over 10 years and it has been an immense pleasure to work with Erick over the past two years since we acquired RedState,"" he continued. ""We cannot thank Erick enough for his leadership and tireless effort and really look forward to being allies with Erick fighting for the conservative ideals we share.""Erickson told The Huffington Post that he informed Salem in June about plans to focus primarily on his radio show and accompanying website after a decade running RedState. He said he’ll remain editor-in-chief through the end of year and still expects to write occasionally for the site after his departure. Erickson said he also plans to participate in next year’s RedState gathering. In the memo, Garthwaite described Wolf as ""earning more and more respect from readers with each passing year"" that he's written for RedState. ""We have great expectations for RedState's growth in readership and influence during the critical months ahead for this country,"" he wrote. ""This is an exciting time for RedState as we take the successes of 2015 and build on them during the 2016 election year and beyond.""Erickson also welcomed Wolf as managing editor in a Monday post, noting that Wolf was coming aboard as he's juggling ""a new book coming out early next year, seminary, and more and more radio obligations."""

That person,"" he continued. ""What are the great films that you and I are missing because their great voices can’t be heard? I want to go to that movie. I want to hear that voice. I’m being denied that voice by a system that’s sent out to give the reins to white men.""Moore felt particularly incensed by a statistic from a University of Southern California study on Hollywood diversity: Of the top 100 films in 2014, only 1.9 percent were directed by women.""I’m telling you, anthropologists are not gonna look kindly on us. We’re gonna look like Neanderthals,"" he stated. ""It’s a form of apartheid, folks, when a minority controls everything and the majority gets a bone thrown to them.""While comparing the representational state of affairs in the film industry to brutally enforced racially discriminatory policies in government is a bit far-fetched, Moore's comments come at a time when an increasing number of actors and industry insiders are calling for better representation both behind the camera and in front of it.

""This is absolutely wrong,"" Moore said of the industry's lack of opportunity for women directors, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""I’m missing out on her story. Their stories. That person,"" he continued. ""What are the great films that you and I are missing because their great voices can’t be heard? I want to go to that movie. I want to hear that voice. I’m being denied that voice by a system that’s sent out to give the reins to white men.""Moore felt particularly incensed by a statistic from a University of Southern California study on Hollywood diversity: Of the top 100 films in 2014, only 1.9 percent were directed by women.""I’m telling you, anthropologists are not gonna look kindly on us. We’re gonna look like Neanderthals,"" he stated. ""It’s a form of apartheid, folks, when a minority controls everything and the majority gets a bone thrown to them.""While comparing the representational state of affairs in the film industry to brutally enforced racially discriminatory policies in government is a bit far-fetched, Moore's comments come at a time when an increasing number of actors and industry insiders are calling for better representation both behind the camera and in front of it.
