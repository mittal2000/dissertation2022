I did everything he recommended to grow my business and create more money in my life. I listened to all the calls, was involved in my mastermind group, went to all the live events, applied meditation, affirmations, dream boards, all the mind and quantum science that he taught and still I wasn't having the results I thought I should be having like some others in the group.I'm a smart, creative, intuitive, intelligent, self-motivated, and entrepreneurial-minded and results orientated person who felt ""something is wrong with me"" because the 'Law of Attraction' wasn't working for me. I'm sure most of you have been in similar circumstances where you applied everything your mentor has taught you about the 'Law of Attraction' or achieving your goals and it didn't work for you. You did everything right, probably multiple times and you still didn't get what you desired. I learned a lot from John along with other ""The Secret"" mentors like Joe Vitale, Bill Harris, Bob Proctor, and scientists like Greg Braden, Candace Pert and Bruce Lipton. Back then the science was just beginning to explain quantum physics and our mind, body and spiritual relationships. I could see that not one teacher had a full understanding or way of explaining how it all worked. So I started mapping it all out visually as I read, listened and learned from each of these teachers. What was I missing that kept me from making the big money and business leaps?Today, I know 'it' was the cause of not having what I desired, but it had nothing to do with my feelings of something being wrong with me. It was my unconscious childhood programming that kept me stuck. It was my belief that I could not have what I desired without great personal sacrifice and hard work. ' It' was my belief that I couldn't financially achieve what a man could and that I had to be perfect in order to feel worthy of receiving my biggest desires. I didn't realize that I didn't feel safe standing out and being different from others for fear of being abandoned by those I loved....and there are many more beliefs I had no idea were running under my conscious radar, dictating the decisions I made in my life.You, too, have unconscious beliefs that are running your decision making process without ever questioning it. Those beliefs are what is keeping you from fulfilling your desires, reaching your goals, manifesting the money, the love, the relationships, the health, the pleasure and happiness you long for. My perception of myself was not aligned with my desires, so there was no way I was going to achieve it. Even though I would spend time visualizing and feeling myself successful in my conscious mind, my more powerful subconscious mind would stop me from seeing opportunities and taking actions that would have created successful results because it was not my inner reality. Working with John helped me realize how powerful I was in creating my world and my new reality but his training didn't take me to my deeply hidden core beliefs at that time. Changing my inner perception of my power rocked my mindset and started the healing of my inner wounded child and gave me permission to take responsibility for creating my life and I happily haven't looked back! I've discovered that our big, deep core issues of self-worth, safety and love are intertwined with our money issues. Personal and professional experiences have revealed that we unconsciously find ways to avoid these issues until they become our biggest challenges and we are ready to wake up to a new way of being. There is something that inspires us to address our inner fears and shadows. It has to be meaningful to go through the growing process, and we don't know how fulfilling it is until we go through it. So it takes a leap of faith, courage and love.Sadly, what is important to us sometimes comes in a wake-up call of an illness, a financial challenge, a divorce, or a great loss of self or something important to you, or through a natural disaster. We each have our own progression of growth that allows us to unlock the deep core issues as we go so we don't shut down completely out of fear. What is keeping you from attracting what you desire into your life is the belief that you can't really have it for some reason. What are the beliefs keeping you stuck? What are the rules or vows that you've adapted for survival over time that don't allow you to have, receive or create more pleasure, money, love or success in your life?It can be hard to see these beliefs because you are so close to them. You think those beliefs are true and are universal truths or they are you - but they aren't! It takes time to wrap your mind around this, but you are worth every moment it takes because this will determine the direction and dynamics of your life! I encourage you to seek a mentor who can guide you and help you in the process of self-discovery and to uncover those subconscious and hidden childhood beliefs that keep you stuck.Live your Turned-On life,Marilyn"
1,POLITICS,"Hillary Clinton Wants To Give Companies A $1,500 Reward For Hiring Apprentices",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-apprentice-credit_n_7599768.html,,2015-06-17,"DES MOINES, IA - JUNE 14: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters during a campaign event at the the Elwell Family food Center at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on June 14, 2015 in Des Moines, Iowa. Clinton officially kicked off her 2016 bid for the White House yesterday during an event on New Yorks Roosevelt Island. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e691871230000781839f7d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton, unveiling the latest plank of her policy platform, on Wednesday will call for a new tax credit to benefit companies that hire people as apprentices. The proposal will be debuted during a campaign swing through South Carolina and, in a bit of political gamesmanship, builds off a proposal from one of the Palmetto State’s U.S. senators, Tim Scott (R). But there are differences between the bill Scott is working on with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), called the LEAP Act, and the one Clinton will propose. The senators' bill would provide a $1,500 tax credit for companies hiring apprentices under age 25, and $1,000 for those older than 25. Clinton is calling for a flat $1,500 credit regardless of age. A Clinton aide told The Huffington Post that she “would be open to adding incentives based on certain other factors, like if the person is a veteran.” But she wouldn’t tie the size of the credit to the age of the apprentice. Under the LEAP Act, the federal tax credit would be available for new apprentices registered with the U.S. Department of Labor or a state apprenticeship agency. Clinton’s proposal would have narrower restrictions on which companies would qualify, mimicking more closely a separate, broader bill from Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine.) and Mariah Cantwell (D-Wash.). Companies “would have to meet rigorous federal and/or state standards and outcome measures” in order to qualify for the credits, the Clinton aide said. Clinton’s proposal does not come with a way to pay for the credits, unlike the LEAP Act, which uses savings in printing costs. But Clinton will introduce a broader array of offsets for this and other items on her domestic agenda later in the campaign, the aide said. (Regardless of whose version goes furthest, both proposals trail Canada, which already has a variation of the apprenticeship tax credit.)At Thursday’s campaign event at Trident Technical College in North Carolina, Clinton is expected to pitch the apprenticeship tax credit in autobiographical terms. A release on the proposal notes Clinton’s experience working in South Carolina after law school for the Children’s Defense Fund to emphasize the importance of encouraging groups to hire young professionals. Clinton got the job through the assistance of a grant for law students working on civil rights research. The apprenticeship tax credit reflects the growing preference of political leaders to use the tax code as a way to encourage hiring. In 2010, Congress passed the HIRE Act, which offered a $1,000 tax credit to companies that hired and retained unemployed workers. On the campaign trail two years later, both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama endorsed similar ideas. Whether it works is another question entirely. As The Huffington Post’s Arthur Delaney reported in June 2012: The Treasury Department reported that from February to October of 2010, businesses hired more than 10 million unemployed people who could have made them eligible for the law's incentives. But there's no telling how many of those hires were actually caused by the incentives, and economists took a dim view of the program. Economists and worker advocates have suspected employers would collect incentives for hires they would have made anyway.Want more updates from Sam? Sign up for his newsletter, Spam Stein."

5,QUEER VOICES,"New Web Series 'Paper Boys' Delivers Diversity, Charisma and a Magical Twist You Never Saw Coming","Wes Janisen, ContributorWriter & blogger, @wesjanisen",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-web-series-paper-boys-delivers-diversity-charisma-and-a-magical-twist-you-never-saw-coming_b_7591486.html,"The new web series Paper Boy highlights the unifying theme for every person in their 20's, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation: That none of us really has a clue what we're doing.",2015-06-17,2015-06-16-1434469763-3496973-paperboys_stills_01.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-16-1434469763-3496973-paperboys_stills_01-thumb.jpg,"I think the unifying theme for every person in their 20's, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation, is that none of us really has a clue what we're doing. Cole, the main character of Paper Boys, is no exception to this rule. He's trying to figure out how to land a job he loves (that will also pay the rent in one of the most expensive cities in the world), what to say to his straight best friend Daren who recently confessed he doesn't want to marry his fiancée, and why he can't seem to stop himself from stalking an old flame, Max, on Facebook. If all of this wasn't enough to worry about already, Cole has also discovered that his sketchbook is, well... enchanted. Whatever Cole draws seems to happen in real life, and while this newfound power could be the answer to all his problems, he hasn't quite figured out if it's only going to make his life even more complicated. Written by Curtis Casella and Kyle Cabral (Cabral also directs the series and stars as Cole), Paper Boys is a delightful new web series that takes the sometimes harsh reality of being a confused millennial trying to juggle love, a career, and a new city, and spices it up with a bit of magic to make it all the more captivating. The first two episodes have already generated over 90,000 views on YouTube, and the creators have recently succeeded in raising $10,500 via their Kickstarter campaign to create two more full episodes (and are hoping to raise even more to keep the series going). I caught up with Kyle and Curtis, as well as Henry Lee (who plays Max), Kai Liu (who plays Rebecca), Sarah Elizabeth (who plays Charlie), and Nathan Brown (who plays Daren) over email, and asked them all about the inspiration behind Paper Boys, as well as what we can expect from future episodes: What do you hope viewers will take away from this series? Henry: That, for the most part, as fantastical as the notebook element may be, we are showcasing real people who are struggling with the same issues that we all deal with. They're asking themselves the same questions we all ask ourselves, while trying to figure out where they fit in the world.Kai: I hope that viewers will notice how diverse we are. The main character is Asian and the sisters are Asian and white. This dynamic is occurring more and more in the world we live in but the media tends to show only homogenous families. I hope we're helping to create a new normal.   In a lot of ways, Paper Boys is a show about ordinary life for your average millennial, and then you have this element of magic mixed in. What was the inspiration for this part of the story?Curtis: When we set out to create Paper Boys, we didn't want to write something that was the same as other shows and web series with gay characters in them, and we ultimately decided on adding in this element of fantasy. We thought the sketchbook was appropriate because it gives Cole a degree of control over his life, which I think many of us millennials don't always feel we have, especially after the financial crisis. So we wanted to explore questions like whether Cole is better off? Will he be happier?  A lot of people describe Paper Boys as a ""gay web series"" -- this seems to happen a lot when a creator features a minority as a main character; the project becomes niche rather than general, it becomes a ""gay web series"" rather than just a ""web series."" What does Paper Boys do to transcend that label and appeal to the masses?Curtis: One of the reasons we created the sketchbook was that a lot of gay media is very rooted in reality - Looking, Weekend - and we wanted to tell a story that wasn't just about being gay, but about a gay character making the discovery that he has this power.Kyle: We'll also have more diversity and representation moving forward, so I hope our series does a good job of being inclusive and relatable. I think the mere fact that we have characters that are involved in such complicated relationships - in terms of family, friends, and love - is something that anyone and everyone can relate to regardless of gender, race, age, or sexual orientation.  Once you realized you possessed a magic notebook that made things happen in real life, what would be the first thing you'd draw?Kai: I would give myself superpowers. Obviously.Henry: Increase the size of my condo by a bedroom and a bathroom and pay off the mortgage. Boring, but practical.Sarah: Me and Jennifer Lawrence eating pizza together. Obviously.Curtis: Paper Boys season two (on HBO?). Or a puppy.Kyle: I can't decide between drawing myself as a new mutant member of the X-Men, or sitting in the master suite office of my very own film and animation production studio. Both are practical, I think.Nathan: ...there are too many things I'd want from comic books to say.Head over to Paper Boy's official website to get caught up on the series, and make sure to ""like"" their Facebook page for updates on new episodes!"

The “Jane the Virgin” star announced on Tuesday that she'll be publishing a book that will encompass all of the lessons she's learned from her father, Genaro Rodriguez. The book, titled I Can And I Will: Tools My Daddy Gave Me, is expected to be released by Simon & Schuster in 2016, according to Entertainment Weekly. Rodriguez enthusiastically shared the news on Twitter after the announcement by the publishing company.“In I Can and I Will, [Rodriguez] will share words of wisdom from her father,” Simon and Schuster associate editor Emily Graff told EW. “These are words that give her strength in times of hardship. Through personal stories, she will describe how these words were challenged, and confirmed. This book will be something you can turn to when you are in search of a friend, when you need inspiration and encouragement.”When Rodriguez, 30, accepted her Golden Globe in January, she spoke about the influence her father has had on her life and career. Rodriguez is just the second Latina to win a Golden Globe for best actress. ""This award is so much more than myself,"" Rodriguez said during her acceptance speech. ""It represents a culture that wants to see themselves as heroes.""""My dad used to tell me to wake up each day and say, 'I can and I will,'"" she continued. ""Well, Dad, today's a great day. I can and I did.""Rodriguez and her fans have since used hashtags like #ICanAndIWill as empowering statements. Earlier this week, the actress channeled her father again with an Instagram photo and caption that thanked him for introducing her to boxing as a child. "

A few dozen protestors with the group Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment staged a demonstration outside of the Wells Fargo headquarters to support those who have lost their homes to foreclosure because of the bank's predatory lending practices. The protest coincides with Wells Fargo's annual shareholder meeting that is being held in Salt Lake City. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb323fd240000510055c428.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember that time the nation's largest banks engaged in fraud and deceptive lending to fuel Wall Street's insatiable appetite for dodgy investments backed by home mortgages? Remember how in the aftermath of the economic collapse, after the banks received massive taxpayer bailouts, some of the same financial institutions totally botched the handling of an epochal wave of foreclosures that their actions had helped to bring about? And how untold thousands of people lost their homes as a result? And how federal regulators chose to ignore warnings about the looming crisis, then looked the other way as mortgage companies misapplied homeowner payments, lost piles of paperwork, and generally made it next to impossible for borrowers to take advantage of (flawed) government-sponsored refinancing programs meant to stem the tide of foreclosures? Perhaps you recall that as part of a legal deal struck in 2011 with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, more than a dozen major mortgage companies paid supposedly independent auditors to review the foreclosure documents of aggrieved borrowers?This is all ringing a bell, right?How about that time the OCC abruptly scrapped the whole program amid cost overruns and allegations of bank employees interference? Were you, perchance, aware that a key condition of that 2011 legal agreement required the mortgage companies to overhaul how they ""service,"" or manage, home loans, to prevent a return to those abuses?Sure, you've been paying attention.But did you know that 99.7 percent of all checks that the banks mailed to consumers as part of a subsequent settlement were for $6,000 or less?So then would you be at all surprised to learn that now, four years later, some of the key players still haven't lived up to the terms of the deal, and homeowners are still suffering as a result? No? Me neither. On Wednesday, the OCC announced that six banks that manage home loans -- EverBank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Santander Bank, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo -- haven't implemented all the reforms they promised to make as part of the 2011 deals.As punishment, the regulator has imposed new restrictions on the banks' mortgage departments, limiting their ability to acquire residential servicing rights in some circumstances, and forcing them to seek OCC approval before hiring senior officers in their mortgage servicing and compliance departments. The restrictions vary, with Wells Fargo and HSBC strictly prohibited from certain types of new business acquisition, while the other banks must first seek OCC approval.Wells Fargo, the OCC said in a new consent order, ""continues to engage in unsafe and unsound practices."" Among the bank's points of ""noncompliance,"" the regulator said in regulator-speak, is its failure to ensure ""effective communication with borrowers, both oral and written.""According to the OCC, Wells Fargo still has yet to ensure that each borrower is matched with a single customer service representative at the bank to handle their modification request or foreclosure -- a basic first step to ending the cycle of confusion, lost paperwork and endless hours on the phone that many homeowners have endured while speaking with a succession of uninformed bank employees.Mike Heid, the president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said in a statement that the bank has ""implemented significant changes to our mortgage servicing operations and achieved compliance with major elements of the original Consent Order."" ""We will continue to work with the OCC to address the remaining items, and we have an action plan in place to complete that work in the coming,"" Heid's statement said.In response to a question about assigning customers to single points of contact, a bank spokesman said that Wells Fargo began that process in 2010, and that the bank is now ""waiting on final validation of recent changes we made in response to new direction provided by the OCC late in 2014.""In the original consent orders, the mortgage companies agreed to 98 separate ""actionable items,"" or reforms, related to how they service loans. Of the banks called out Wednesday by the OCC for not meeting this pledge, HSBC apparently has the farthest to go. The bank failed to implement 45 reforms, the OCC said, including those that address more than a dozen procedural failings related directly to how it manages customer accounts.Did you know that HSBC's procedures for handling consumer complaints; for ensuring payments are promptly applied; for making sure the bank isn't foreclosing at the same time it's helping with a mortgage modification; for training staff to handle mortgage delinquencies; for communicating with borrowers about loan modification requests ""within a reasonable period of time"" before a foreclosure sale is commenced -- were all found lacking by the OCC?""We are actively addressing the remaining issues, and we will continue to work closely with the OCC to ensure we fully comply with all requirements of the order,"" said HSBC spokesman Rob Sherman.And if you need some positive news to hold on to until the next quiz: Citibank and PNC Bank received passing grades from the regulator, and the 2011 consent orders were terminated."

On Tuesday the husbands of two of the women appealed for their return, fearing they might have gone to Syria.""We have received information that contact has been made with the family in the UK ,"" West Yorkshire police said in a statement. ""Contact has been made by one of the missing women and there is an indication that they may have already crossed the border into Syria but this is uncorroborated.""The group flew to Saudi Arabia in May for an Islamic pilgrimage, and a Turkish security official said they traveled to Istanbul on June 9.Their families grew concerned when they failed to arrive back in Britain on June 11 as expected and British police contacted their Turkish counterparts for help the next day.Earlier on Wednesday a Turkish official said authorities were working to locate the women and their children, but had found no trace of them. ""We have no idea if they are in Turkey or have crossed into Syria,"" the official said.British authorities estimate more than 700 Britons have traveled to Syria, with a significant proportion thought to have joined Islamic State, which has taken over vast areas of the country and neighboring Iraq.Islamic State is believed to have attracted thousands of foreign fighters, many of whom have passed through Turkey.Turkey has rebuffed criticism from some Western countries for failing to stem the flow, arguing that domestic intelligence agencies need to do more to stop their nationals being radicalized and traveling to Turkey in the first place.In February, Turkey accused Britain of taking too long to inform it about three London schoolgirls who had traveled to the country in what was suspected to be an attempt to journey on to Syria.

Galbraith, ContributorEconomist, Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greece-imf-tough-choices_b_7603594.html,"ATHENS -- The IMF and Greece's other creditors have assumed that massive fiscal contraction has only a temporary effect on economic activity, employment and taxes, and that slashing wages, pensions and public jobs has a magical effect on growth. This has proved false. Indeed, Greece's post-2010 adjustment led to economic disaster -- and the IMF's worst predictive failure ever.",2015-06-17,"ATHENS, GREECE - JUNE 16: Greek Finance Minister Yianis Varoufakis attends a meeting as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras addresses his party members and ministers at the Greek Parliament on June 16, 2015 in Athens, Greece. The European Commission has said that Greece and its international creditors need to come to an agreement within the next 2 weeks to avoid a possible default, after weekend talks collapsed. (Photo by Milos Bicanski/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc150522400003300382d3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ATHENS -- The International Monetary Fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, recently asked a simple and important question: ""How much of an adjustment has to be made by Greece, how much has to be made by its official creditors?"" But that raises two more questions: How much of an adjustment has Greece already made? And have its creditors given anything at all?In May 2010, the Greek government agreed to a fiscal adjustment equal to 16 percent of GDP from 2010 to 2013. As a result, Greece moved from a primary budget deficit (which excludes interest payments on debt) of more than 10 percent of GDP to a primary balance last year -- by far the largest such reversal in post-crisis Europe.The IMF initially projected that Greece's real (inflation-adjusted) GDP would contract by around 5 percent over the 2010-2011 period, stabilize in 2012, and grow thereafter. In fact, real GDP fell 25 percent, and did not recover. And, because nominal GDP fell in 2014 and continues to fall, the debt/GDP ratio, which was supposed to stabilize three years ago, continues to rise.Blanchard notes that in 2012, Greece agreed ""to generate enough of a primary surplus to limit its indebtedness"" and to implement ""a number of reforms which should lead to higher growth."" Those so-called reforms included sharply lower public spending, minimum-wage reductions, fire-sale privatizations, an end to collective bargaining and deep pension cuts. Greece followed through, but the depression continued.The IMF and Greece's other creditors have assumed that massive fiscal contraction has only a temporary effect on economic activity, employment and taxes, and that slashing wages, pensions and public jobs has a magical effect on growth. This has proved false. Indeed, Greece's post-2010 adjustment led to economic disaster -- and the IMF's worst predictive failure ever.Blanchard should know better than to persist with this fiasco. Once the link between ""reform"" and growth is broken -- as it has been in Greece -- his argument collapses. With no path to growth, the creditors' demand for an eventual 3.5 percent-of-GDP primary surplus is actually a call for more contraction, beginning with another deep slump this year.But, rather than recognizing this reality and adjusting accordingly, Blanchard doubles down on pensions. He writes:Why insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75 percent of primary spending; the other 25 percent have already been cut to the bone. Pension expenditures account for over 16 percent of GDP, and transfers from the budget to the pension system are close to 10 percent of GDP. We believe a reduction of pension expenditures of 1 percent of GDP (out of 16 percent) is needed, and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners.Note first the damning admission: apart from pensions and wages, spending has already been ""cut to the bone."" And remember: the effect of this approach on growth was negative. So, in defiance of overwhelming evidence, the IMF now wants to target the remaining sector, pensions, where massive cuts -- more than 40 percent in many cases -- have already been made. The new cuts being demanded would hit the poor very hard.Pension payments now account for 16 percent of Greek GDP precisely because Greece's economy is 25 percent smaller than it was in 2009. Without five years of disastrous austerity, Greek GDP might be 33 percent higher than it is now, and pensions would be 12 percent of GDP rather than 16 percent. The math is straightforward.Blanchard calls on Greece's government to offer ""truly credible measures."" Shouldn't the IMF do likewise? To get pensions down by one percentage point of GDP, nominal economic growth of just 4 percent per year for two years would suffice -- with no further cuts. Why not have ""credible measures"" to achieve that goal?This brings us to Greek debt. As everyone at the IMF knows, a debt overhang is a vast unfunded tax liability that says to investors: enter at your own risk. At any time, your investments, profits and hard work may be taxed away to feed the dead hand of past lenders. The overhang is a blockade against growth. That is why every debt crisis, sooner or later, ends in restructuring or default.Blanchard is a pioneer in the economics of public debt. He knows that Greece's debt has not been sustainable at any point during the last five years, and that it is not sustainable now. On this point, Greece and the IMF agree.In fact, Greece has a credible debt proposal. First, let the European Stabilization Mechanism lend €27 billion ($30 billion), at long maturities, to retire the Greek bonds that the European Central Bank foolishly bought in 2010. Second, use the profits on those bonds to pay off the IMF. Third, include Greece in the ECB's program of quantitative easing, which would let it return to the markets.Greece would agree to fair conditions for the ESM loan. It does not ask for one cent of additional official funding for the Greek state. It is promising to live within its means forever, and rely on internal savings and external investment for growth -- far short of what any large country, controlling its own currency, would do when facing a comparable disaster.Blanchard insists that now is the time for ""tough choices, and tough commitments to be made on both sides."" Indeed it is. But the Greeks have already made tough choices. Now it is the IMF's turn, beginning with the decision to admit that the policies it has imposed for five long years created a disaster. For the other creditors, the toughest choice is to admit -- as the IMF knows -- that their Greek debts must be restructured. New loans for failed policies -- the current joint creditor proposal -- is, for them, no adjustment at all.© Project Syndicate"

To be honest, it is nothing but disgraceful that nourishing our children would ever be considered a 'statement,' yet this is the world we find ourselves in.So we feed on.And as we nurse, we breathe confidence into the mother too afraid to lift her shirt.And as we talk about breastfeeding, as the dialogue flows, we spread knowledge about basic human biology and simple legal rights.And as we share our pictures, in celebration and in pride, we take another step forwards... another step towards normalizing breastfeeding.Because the more we see it, the more normal it will become.Feeding our babies should not be shocking.Comforting our children should not be a statement.Using our bodies as nature intended should not be front-page news.Let's nurse until they are bored of watching... let's breastfeed until no more heads turn or faces flush. Let's normalize it together, as we nourish our children.So I bring to you a glimpse of real-life nursing in real-life (public) places. I bring just a few pictures, from many hundreds sent to me to share, of real moms and real babies and real breastfeeding... from the beanbag isle to public transport... Because I cannot stress this enough: the more we see breastfeeding, the more normalized it will become.Thank you to the proud moms who allowed me to feature their pictures in this piece.

It could be the soundtrack for an insane asylum. Frantic wooden flutes and vibraphones, playing a hectic, repetitive pattern. Ah, a moment of silence between jams. We have returned to Bali sooner than expected. I was invited to sing at the 14th International Bali Roundup. It's a chance to be of service, so we decided to go for it. Plus, it's a rare opportunity to sing in paradise.Our journey to Indonesia had it's up's & downs. I left my phone in the Brisbane airport terminal during a tolerable stop-over. This is not a life & death occurrence, but my reaction to it after about eighteen hours of travel, was less than graceful. I really wish our world was free from terrorism. For so many reasons. Nowadays, you can not disembark your plane. Once you check in, it's stay put or forfeit your flight. I'm generally a big fan of Virgin Airlines (in this case Virgin Australia), but when a flight attendant talks to you like you are a potential terrorist, the fan meter lessens. Back in the day, my emotions were unbridled. That which makes me a heartfelt singer, makes me a ball of unwanted sensitivities, tears, and emotional energies. I have a dim memory of forgetting my passport on a security belt in the UK. Already locked on board an Aer Lingus puddle jumper, I recall knocking on the airplane window in a crazed ""get me outta here!!"" escape attempt. My poor friends, Irish & well-behaved, were writhing with embarrassment. How I didn't land myself in the airport security slammer, I will never know. So this time, when the Virgin Australia attendant demanded I bring it down a few notches, I realized there was an excellent chance that they'd boot me off the plane if I didn't cooperate. Ah the wisdom of age. I confess, I did have fantastical thoughts of tearing out the plane entrance tube to retrieve and rescue my poor abandoned iPhone. That little piece of technology makes traveling so convenient. I was having a flash of tech withdrawals. ""How will I navigate around a foreign country?"" ""What about my voice exercise mp3's?"" ""All the hotel reservations are on there!"" ""Oh, the photo ops I'll miss!"" ""Man, what's a replacement going to cost"". All that panicked thinking firing off in about 10 milliseconds. Survivalist thinking as it were. Reality - I wasn't traveling alone. I could easily use my girlfriend's iPhone for all of the above. But the mind, or this mind, just doesn't work like that. Especially two-thirds into a twenty-four-hour journey.In the end, Virgin came through. Perhaps the nagging & crying worked? Someone on staff walked over to the bar where I left it. My lonely 5s is now on her way to France! A near escape from the iPhone graveyard, found in every airport, in every city. It was a happy ending for all.Follow Cynthia Catania on Facebook & Twitter & Instagram."

Turkey now faces the prospect of weeks of political unrest after the AK Party lost its parliamentary majority in polls over the weekend. (Photo by Burak Kara/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1501c240000360076f5c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VIENNA -- Turkey is moving into unchartered political territory, following the failure of the ruling Justice and Development Party to retain its parliamentary majority in the country's recent general election. The choices that Turkey makes in establishing a new government will not only be pivotal to shaping the future of democracy there; the next administration could also play a decisive role in a series of peace processes vital to restoring stability in the wider Middle East.First and foremost for Turkey, there is the ongoing peace process with its own Kurdish population. At its core, this process is about redefining the secular, unitary state created in 1923. Everyone in the new republic who was not explicitly defined as a member of an officially recognized minority was supposed to merge into a new Turkish identity.But this did not happen as Atatürk planned. Kurds held fast to their own ethnic identity. Eventually, the suppression of the Kurdish language and culture fueled a brutal insurgency, led by the Kurdish Workers' Party, which has cost the country more than 30,000 lives.It is to the great credit of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that he had the courage to launch an open peace process with the PKK in 2013. Since then, that process has made progress that seemed unthinkable only a few years ago. Yet key steps toward lasting peace remain to be taken.A comprehensive settlement of the Kurdish issue within Turkey will be key to the country's stability and the future of its bid for accession to the European Union. Otherwise, one can envisage scenarios in which the forces of disintegration now roiling the neighboring Levant actually spread into Turkey itself, with unimaginable consequences.The success of the mainly Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party in capturing 13 percent of the vote in the recent election -- a total well above the party's core constituency -- should boost the Kurds' confidence and ease the way ahead in the peace process. But the far-right Nationalist Movement Party performed strongly in the election, capturing 16 percent of the vote, probably owing largely to popular opposition to the opening to the Kurds. Indeed, even Erdoğan, evidently trying to stop the MHP's advance, used campaign rhetoric that alienated many Kurdish voters.A high priority for any new government in Turkey should be to complete the peace process that Erdoğan began. And Erdoğan should understand that his legacy might well be shaped by whether that process succeeds or fails.The second peace process at stake is the new attempt to unify Cyprus, which has been divided since its constitutional breakdown in 1963 and Turkey's invasion in 1974. Indeed, it is bizarre that the capital of an EU member country is divided by a dead zone patrolled for decades by United Nations peacekeeping troops.The continued division of Cyprus is blocking both the EU accession talks with Turkey and increasingly necessary cooperation between the EU and NATO. But now, under President Nicos Anastasiades and the newly elected president of Northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akinci, there is a real possibility, after years of stalemate, of reaching a settlement that can re-unify the island. UN-supported talks have acquired new and important momentum.But a settlement will not be possible without the clear support of the Turkish government. The new administration's stance will thus be critical: Turkey has much to gain by supporting a solution in Cyprus; but it could also revert to old habits and spoil today's unique opportunity.The third peace process in play concerns Turkey's relationship with Armenia, which, if improved, could help create the conditions for a peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A far-sighted agreement was signed by Armenia and Turkey in Zürich in October 2009; but wider regional forces eventually blocked progress, with Russian intervention decisive.Maintaining the frozen conflict with Armenia is not in the long-term interests of Turkey or any other state in the region. The ongoing blockades and military face-offs could, at some point, lead to violent upheaval in the southern Caucasus, with very negative effects for Turkey. The next government should resume the approach it took in Zürich --- and Armenia's government must do the same.The fourth and most immediately consequential peace process concerns Syria. Turkey has taken a principled and strong stand against President Bashar al-Assad's regime, and has generously taken in more than a million refugees. But the dangers posed by the ongoing conflict, particularly the strains on Turkey itself, should not be underestimated.All key actors have a common interest in preserving the Syrian state while changing the regime. A complete collapse, fueled by efforts to impose a political solution by military means, would most likely lead to catastrophic consequences for decades to come, with Turkey among the worst affected. So Turkey's new administration should be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue, together with the United States and Iran, on possible solutions.The immediate task facing Turkey is to bridge old divisions and establish a functioning coalition government. Otherwise, a fresh election -- and thus fresh political uncertainty -- will be unavoidable. That is why Turkey's friends should take this opportunity to remind the country's leaders of what is at stake -- for Turkey itself, as well as for peace in the region.© Project Syndicate"

I notice you in theaters, your eyes locked upon me as if sitting was a crime. Every time I look down at a magazine, there are your eyes, in the corner of mine just looking for whatever it is you expect from me. To be honest I'm quite content with myself. I've worked so very hard to become this person you gawk at rudely in the waiting room. It's taken me so many years of affirmation and strength to love myself, and it's something I continually work to re-affirm.

I know they say chivalry is dead, but general respect and saying thank you never goes out of style in my world. My mother taught me that it's rude to stare. She told me how disrespectful it comes off to suddenly start ignoring the person in front of you having a conversation. Despite what you may have been convinced, I do not enter society everyday to pass your test. I do not dress myself in accordance to your mandates, and I refuse to console you because this isn't about you. Yet here you are, staring at me. Your gaze burning a hole through my being, casting a judgement upon my soul. I constantly wonder if you realize how you look, how others see you.  When you're frozen there for about 30 seconds, you turn into a lifeless statue. Unlike you, I know how people see me. I've spent more than enough time watching people watch me. People of all ages, young and old alike. It's funny, children never seem to notice me that much. I drift on by. It's usually middle aged adults. Some gaze, look at me and see a beautiful woman. Some see a man in a dress. Some just stare and don't know what to think. However you see me, I don't want to know. It's not fair for you to invade the sanctity of my body with your complete contempt of human decency. Next time when you're out in the world and you see someone like me, keep your gaze to yourself. I don't want your opinion, your validation, and I don't care to cater to your audacity. After all, didn't your mama teach you any manners?Love, an unapologetic trans girl."

This is why it's so vital to carry out effective recruitment tactics.,2015-06-16,2015-06-15-1434390872-8696148-Bigstock51531233MythsandFactsopposition.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-15-1434390872-8696148-Bigstock51531233MythsandFactsopposition-thumb.jpg,"Employees are just as important to a business as the products and services being sold. This is why it's so vital to carry out effective recruitment tactics. Surprisingly, it is possible to segment potential workers based on certain characteristics and specifics. Here's a quick look at few myths about employee recruitment that prevent you from finding the best workers.Myth #1: The best employees will come to you If only! Wouldn't that make life easy? Occasionally an ideal employee might discover your company, but generally, the best workers have no problem securing a job. This is why you want to recruit them.Myth #2: Only big businesses should recruit workers It doesn't matter if your company employees five or 5,000 employees, each worker influences the overall success of your company. When you don't take the time to recruit quality workers, you end up with employees who don't know how to provide top-notch outcomes. This, of course, leads to poor performance, inefficiencies, and a drop in your profit.Myth #3: Not every position requires recruiting You might think that the janitor position isn't worth carrying employing recruitment strategies. Think again! All positions should be carefully evaluated. If there is a role within your company that needs to be filled, take time to recruit a worker who can fill the role with the utmost effectiveness and efficiency. Not only does this decrease overhead, it also boosts productivity and profits.Myth #4: Employee recruitment is too time consuming Did you know that using employee recruitment software can fill positions before they become open? This means all applicants are unbiasedly compared according to your desired preferences, and the software shows you which applicants are best suited for each position within your company.Myth #5: Recruiting software can do all the work for you While recruitment software is of benefit, keep in mind that software isn't human. It doesn't have your intuition. After evaluating the applicants, if your hunch suggests a certain candidate, carefully consider the role of your intuition. Your instincts can be spot on.Myth #6: Employee recruitment scares away applicants Many small businesses believe a recruitment process scares away applicants who are potentially good workers. On the contrary! Talented individuals expect to go through a recruitment process. And, most times, a recruitment process significantly simplifies hiring for your HR department and the applicants.Myth #7: Quality workers are too hard to find If you've had trouble recruiting quality workers in the past, rest assured--good employees are out there. You simply need to let them know you're looking for them. This involves posting on social media, marketing the position on your company website and job boards, and through good, old-fashioned word-of-mouth advertising.Myth #8: Employee recruitment is ineffective  Employee recruitment is effective, regardless of what you've heard in the past. In fact, Jobvite found a 49 percent improvement in the quality of applicants when using social media employee recruitment tactics. Unbridled Talent discovered over 300 million job searches conducted each month. Recruiting employees is effective when using the Internet properly.The Takeaway If you consider implementing employee recruitment strategies, take comfort in knowing your efforts will net good results. From a reduction in employee turnover to enhanced customer service, employee recruitment takes your company to the next level of success.

As we age and become parents, we undoubtedly become aware of the crucial life lessons imparted by our fathers. Many of these lessons were implicit in their behavior and not necessarily spoken about, yet those unspoken lessons are often the ones that leave the biggest imprint on our hearts and souls. Here are three life lessons that my father has taught me.1. Money isn't everything - While my father worked hard, never once do I remember him obsessing over money. He didn't talk about other people's money nor did he seem to be impressed by money. Money was a necessary object that helped pay for tuition, buy food, and even do fun things, yet it was never the be all and end all, nor the judge of one's self-worth. I have early memories of my father giving us our weekly allowance. It was assumed we would give a portion of it every week to tzedaka. Money wasn't ours to hoard; but to share with others who were less fortunate. 2. Caring for others - We grew up feeling a duty to always think about others. Even though my father often came home late from work, he spent many evenings on the phone soliciting donations for various charities. It forever impacted me to be aware of the plight of others. As long as there were others suffering somewhere, it was never sufficient to live in our own bubble and remain indifferent. Even within our own family, we learned how to be considerate of other's needs, to do a favor for a family member, and to inquire what we could do to help. My father has taught me that being in a relationship often means putting the needs of others first.3. Pursue Peace - There are many people who like a good fight. My father is not one of them. He always avoided conflict at all costs and chose to be the bigger man. To this day, I see him shrugging off hurtful comments or criticism. While many men would get reactive, my father has very little ego and couldn't care less. I rarely remember him getting angry about everything. His gentle nature has quietly made an impression on all those who meet him. His example has helped me become a patient father and husband and the calming force in our home.While my father may not think that his actions have been impactful, they have greatly influenced every area of my life. Children learn what they live. My father's calm nature, caring persona, and healthy attitude towards money, are his unsung qualities that have become part of my own being.We all wish to impart important life lessons to our children. What are we sharing with them, even non-verbally? Father's day is a great reminder for us all to reflect upon the lessons we have learned, consider what values we are transferring to our own children, and to share the appreciation that we may lose sight of, in the day-to-day of our busy lives.

Unemployed On Line, Oil on canvas, 40 x 80"", 2013 Your work is classified as social realism. Can you talk a bit about the form? Social refers to the concepts or subjects of my paintings, which are about life in the real world. It is about the human conditions that I see and experience on the streets of New York and it is about issues of war and peace, justice and injustice, and, in general, the tragedies as well as the joys in our lives. The realism of the content is the truthfulness of the social situation. John Keats said ""Truth is beauty..."" which for me means that it is beautiful to face reality, not to falsify or glamorize or avoid it like so many Germans did in Nazi Germany when they saw Jews disappearing from their neighborhoods or like we do when we fail to speak up or ""blow the whistle"" about injustice fearing for our own insecurity. The realism of the form is the realistic or natural appearance of the images, especially the human forms. For me, there is an aesthetic beauty of the human form. As a humanist I cannot accept the mangled abstraction of the human form as seen in much of modern art.  I believe that the realism of form can communicate ideas most effectively. You paint in a traditional manner, taking cues from masters like Goya and Sorolla, while depicting scenes that speak directly to topical issues, like your recent paintings about foreclosure, Abu Ghraib, and long unemployment lines. Are there artists whom you admire both for their artistic skill and for rebelling through their subject matter? There are artists whose work I think is beautiful and well-painted. For example, John Singer Sargent is a masterful painter, but he was painting a different reality, that of an aristocratic world. I identify much more with painters like Dagnan-Bouveret and Jean-Francois Millet who painted French peasants naturalistically and Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida who expressed in his paintings a strong earthy feeling for ordinary Spanish people. The Russian painter Ilya Repin and the American painter Winslow Homer also expressed the reality of life of ordinary people in a realistic and skillful manner.On the other hand I admire Francisco De Goya for his anti-war expressions, Disasters of War. But in my painting Torture Abu Ghraib, I am only partially inspired by Disasters of War.

I asked as I reluctantly settled into the sensation of tiny jabs of stinging ink penetrating my lightly tanned skin.Small talk was my way of pushing aside the heart pounding, the sweaty palms, and the out of body sensations of doubt that had filled my mind for the previous 24 hours.""Do you want the long version or the short one?"" my tattoo artist inquired.""I'll take the long, I'm going to be here for awhile right?""Turns out this highly talented woman found her calling after spending years as an art teacher.Realizing the world of education was not for her, she fully embraced love of body art, worked her tail off to find an apprenticeship and went after her dream.She gets it, I thought.She gets all of it.Why I'm here. What I'm doing. The love of symbolic, artistic expression. And the importance of going after your passion and purpose.Sometimes you don't realize how powerful a desire is until you speak it out loud.That's what happened when I was on a call with a trusted friend back in December and admitted I had been thinking about a new tattoo for awhile.But but I stammered...""I'm not exactly sure what I want the final design to look like""There was fear. Some of it rational. Most of it way irrational.I was standing in my own way with excuses instead of taking small action steps and seeing where they might lead.That's the thing with fear though.Every fiber of your being tries to tell you that you're wrong, but at the core you know that the desire you feel is absolutely 100% without a doubt right.There was that time I decided to switch out of classroom teaching to technology and felt like an absolute fraud.Each of those scenarios has something in common.Fear.You know what it feels like.Those moments where every alert light in your body goes off trying to tell you that your dreams, goals, and desires are wrong.Or that you don't really know what your desires are, because there are other dreams you should go after instead.Or you'll never attain the goals you're after because, who are you anyway? You're simply unworthy of ultimate happiness and contentment in your life.But sometimes a dream takes hold and it doesn't let go. So you take the leap and do it anyway.And everything turns out better than expected.Getting the gumption to email a tattoo artist, schedule a consult, and eventually get inked was the ultimate exercise in self-discovery, intuition, confidence, and commitment.And there are a few things this experience taught me about the importance of honoring oneself and going after dreams no matter how big or small.Here are the eight things getting a tattoo taught me about myself:1. Grounding. Each time doubt would creep in I centered myself, and tapped into my intuition, and asked whether my dream was simply a 'should' or a true 'desire'.2. Self-Care. I learned the power of stepping up and saying YES to myself, asking for support, and doing something just for me!3. Commitment. Getting a tattoo (especially a sizable one) can be scary! I made sure to communicate to my body that I'm committed to walking with fear instead of always pushing it aside.4. Patience. Deciding to get such a visible tattoo was not a decision I took lightly. I did 3+ years of research: observing and pinning images, figuring out my style, and finding the right artist. Even after finding her there was a 5 month waiting list to schedule my appointment.5. Trust. At my initial consult I felt like I was being taken care of. My fears were discussed and I felt at ease as each of my concerns were taken into consideration. Something so permanent and personal forces you to put full trust and faith into yourself and who works with you.6. Assertiveness. I gave myself full permission to say no, change course, or ask for what I really wanted. The day of the design reveal there were a few tweaks I needed in order to be fully happy with the final outcome. I learned it was ok to ask for them.7. Confidence. This was a total step out of my comfort zone. I'm a quiet country girl. It took a ton of mental effort for me to make the first steps in scheduling an consult. Once I did though, the experience became much more 'real' instead of 'just a dream'. 8. Emotions. With any dream there will be pain, struggle, or obstacles standing in your way. The tattoo process is a physical reminder to breathe through the pain and take the journey one minute or one moment at a time. Tattoo artist: Liaa WalterWhat untold dreams are you holding beneath the surface waiting to be revealed?Don't be afraid. I'm holding a safe space for you to share them with me. I'll be waiting in the comments for you. This post first appeared on Beryl Ayn Young's personal blog where she inspires moms to love their photos and their life. "

Personally, I take the time to balance my family's books, mostly financially but from time to time environmentally as well. So, back in January I did a rough calculation of my personal carbon footprint for 2014 using data from our local utility, my own record of travel activity, and emission factors for local transit from the transportation LCA database developed by Mikhail Chester, Arpad Horvath, and their colleagues, as well as the ICCT's aircraft performance model. Doing so helped me put several recent articles on the environmental cost of air travel into perspective. First observation: my carbon budget reaffirms that I'm in the right line of work. Transportation - especially the 11,000 miles I commuted to the office by train and the 12,000 miles I flew last year for our two family vacations - accounted for almost 80% of my personal carbon footprint in 2014. In contrast, my residential energy use was modest, thanks to a mix of personal choice (some investments in energy efficiency and sharing a small home with my family) and luck (being located in Northern California, with its temperate climate and a relatively clean electricity mix). Automobile emissions were low because I only drive on the weekends, and even then in a fuel-efficient car. In total, my direct energy consumption led to about 3.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) being emitted last year, which doesn't look too bad considering the global average of about 5 metric tons per person, not to mention the 16.5 tons put out by the typical American. One caveat: my calculation doesn't take into account carbon emissions due to embodied energy use linked to the production of food and manufactured goods, my share of the built environment, etc., complicating a direct comparison.  Even this figure underestimates how central transportation, especially air travel, is to my carbon footprint because it doesn't take into account work-related air travel. As a technical observer to UN agencies that regulate international transportation -the International Civil Aviation Organization for planes, and the International Maritime Organization for ships - I fly regularly to attend meetings to help set emission standards for planes and ships. Last year I flew 77,000 miles on 30 flights over 9 work trips, releasing an additional 11 tons of CO2. This means that flying for work quadrupled my emissions last year. And this doesn't take in account emissions of nitrogen oxides, black carbon, and water vapor that likely make a gallon of fuel burned in a plane worse for the global climate than if it were used in a car or truck. 2014 air travel (work trips in blue, personal trips in green)  Source: www.gcmap.comSo what can be done about this? If we're going to be bluntly honest, in the short term, and on the individual level, not always very much; I can't take a bus to London, and I can't not go if I want to do my job. This is a systemic problem, not an individual one. To be sure, individual travelers can vote with their dollars and choose to fly on less polluting airlines, and we should. ICCT research has shown that in 2013 the least fuel-efficient airline in the US released 27% more CO2 than the most efficient carriers to provide a comparable level of transport service, a gap that can be even larger on individual routes (see the appendix of this study). If more travelers let that fact influence their planning, the industry will have to take notice. For shorter trips where planes, trains, and automobiles really do compete, getting there and back again by a more efficient mode of travel may be part of the solution, too. But the fact that this is a systemic problem means that we need governments to develop policies internationally and domestically here in the U.S. to promote more efficient planes and to impose a price on carbon to curb aviation emissions. Unfortunately, the jury is out about how ambitious policymakers really will be in the near term. Longer-term, larger investments in new technologies such as blended wing body aircraft, open rotor engines, and third generation biofuels will also be important.All this, and more, will be needed given that aviation CO2 emissions are on track to triple by mid-century at the same time that many developed countries are resolving to reduce their emissions by 80% in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The fact that to succeed we have to tackle this as a systemic problem doesn't mean that personal choice won't come into play as well. The days of the ""road warrior"" business traveler are numbered, if we're serious about reducing GHG emissions from aviation. We -- I -- need to be thinking harder than ever about whether it's really that important to be at that meeting in person rather than virtually. (And so do our bosses.). At some point more of us will likely have to start enjoying the benefits of staying a little closer to home.

Quite a surprise considering the headline facts and figures. As a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions agriculture is significant: around a quarter of the global total when factoring in the wider food chain and indirect impacts. Second, the most recent assessments of the best scientific evidence available indicate that agriculture is already affected by climate change, with negative impacts set to increase in the coming decades. Looking forward, meeting the needs of a growing and more affluent global population, which by some estimates would demand a 50% increase in total food production over today's levels, will require that the agricultural sector to reconcile being both a culprit and victim of climate change.It is troubling, then, that this critical sector is not been more upfront in deliberations over a global climate agreement. But this is now changing, and we are seeing welcome progress: within the global UN Climate Change process, agriculture-related topics are being examined by one of the convention's main subsidiary bodies (SBSTA), which met last week in Bonn, Germany. SBSTA, which is tasked with providing advice on scientific and technological matters, is unique in the sense that it is able to draw in, digest and present the latest scientific findings and options from experts, whilst sitting at a distance from the politicized atmosphere of the COP. During the conference, countries considered issues relating to agriculture in two dedicated workshops. Agriculture groups hope that formal consideration of these issues by the SBSTA will raise the profile of agriculture more generally in the formal process at climate change negotiations and improve the state of, and access to, scientific understanding amongst parties.Fueling the SBSTA's progress is salient scientific evidence. Fortunate then is the timing of the latest publications from the vanguard of climate knowledge, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The second installment of AR5 came in 2014 and included for the first time a dedicated chapter on food security. This chapter characterizes the potential future effects of climate change on agriculture, identifies knowledge gaps and recommends increased urgency for adaptation within the sector. A dedicated chapter on food security such as this underscores the increasing importance of the subject, a point seemingly reflected in the evolution of chapter titles relating to food and agriculture through the Assessment Report back-catalogue. (Second Assessment Report: 'Vulnerability to climate change'; Third Assessment Report: 'Ecosystems and Their Goods and Services'; Assessment Report 4: 'Food, fibre and forest products'; and Assessment Report 5 'Food Security and Food Production Systems'). These Assessment Reports represent the current state of knowledge and global scientific consensus on climate change drivers, impacts, adaptation and mitigation; a feat achieved by synthesizing the latest peer reviewed literature.So what kind of science is informing the IPCC's Assessment Reports chapters on agriculture, food security and land use? A pertinent question for CGIAR, a consortium of research organizations involving some 10,000 scientists, aligned to a goal of achieving a food secure future. A recent analysis of IPCC citations comparing the 2001, 2007 and 2014 IPCC Assessment Reports, revealed a notable jump in the absolute number and relative share of total citations from CGIAR researchers in relevant chapters of the latest Report. These results are encouraging because CGIAR focusses its work on developing countries and smallholder farmers, and has in its mission a focus on poverty alleviation and food insecurity. Getting more evidence about impacts and options for smallholder farmers is crucial as the literature is dominated by work in developed countries. We hope that the scientific contributions will aid decision makers worldwide to effectively and fairly integrate the interests of smallholder farmers into a global climate agreement."

We would have shared with my husband, but he was late to the party and we had already made short work of it.Never underestimate two girls with a fork and a free afternoon, just saying.The cake itself is slightly dense and moist, full of zippy lime flavor and pretty green color. The strawberry frosting has a bit of cream cheese in it, just to give it a tangy creaminess. It's the perfect contrast to the lime and a great flavor combination.Definitely keep an eye on this cake while it's baking – even just a bit of over baking will make it a little dry and crumbly. And we all know that dry cakes are against the law. For extra moistness and flavor, feel free to brush the cakes with a bit of lime juice after you level them with a serrated knife. --About Kristan Kristan is known for her candy creations and hilarity on Confessions of a Cookbook Queen.

Sam Brownback speaks at the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka, Kan. Brownback is calling on the GOP-dominated Legislature to junk the stateâs current formula for distributing $3.6 billion in aid to school districts. Heâs proposed distributing most of the money to districts in âblock grantsâ that remain stable while lawmakers draft a new formula.

Adding to that adage, pusillanimous politicians propose undressing the court: if you fear its decision, strip it of jurisdiction. You might even steal the court's money, or push the judge off the bench.The latest practitioner of such interbranch bullying is senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas. Afraid that the Supreme Court will invoke the Constitution to safeguard same-sex marriage and that other federal courts will then follow that new precedent, he has introduced in the Senate the ""Protect Marriage from the Courts Act."" The act threatens to strip the jurisdiction of lower federal courts, as well as the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, over ""claims pertaining to the constitutionality of State marriage laws.""Of course, the Supreme Court is on the verge of deciding precisely such an appeal. Lest it issue its judgment before the bill becomes law, not to worry: the bill refers to the pending case and provides that no non-parties -- in other words, no state judges -- ""shall have any obligation to comply with the decision.""The way to protect marriage, apparently, is to declare war on the independent judiciary, a pillar of our constitutional democracy. This legislative attempt to restrain the judicial branch violates the separation-of-powers doctrine, and the invitation to state judges to ignore a Supreme Court decision makes a hash of the constitutional enshrinement of federal law as ""the supreme Law of the Land.""To justify this power (s)trip, Cruz seeks refuge in two flawed lines of reasoning. One turns on Congress's constitutional authority to ""ordain and establish"" lower courts. That greater power to create courts from scratch, goes the argument, inherently includes the lesser power to withhold cases selectively from their jurisdiction. That logic is dubious; just because I don't have to hire any employees at all does not mean that once I do I can pay them as little as I'd like. In any event, although broad, neutral limitations on lower courts' jurisdiction have long been accepted, the notion that Congress can cherry-pick specific cases has not.With respect (so to speak) to the Supreme Court, Cruz's bill relies on the constitutional provision that ""the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction . . . with such Exceptions . . . as the Congress shall make."" But would-be jurisdiction-strippers misinterpret that clause. In fact, so do their opponents who protest that exceptions violate the Constitution's spirit while ruefully conceding that the letter of the law allows them. What both groups overlook is that exceptions to appellate jurisdiction do not abrogate jurisdiction altogether. Rather, as I have explained in detail elsewhere, exceptions expedite the hearing of important cases by moving them into the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, which is otherwise quite circumscribed.As troubling as Cruz's attempt to divest courts of jurisdiction is in theory, in practice it is a political striptease with little chance of consummation. Perhaps even more scandalous is a judiciary appropriations bill that Sam Brownback, governor of Kansas, actually signed into law recently. Brownback knows that the state supreme court will likely soon address the constitutionality of a favored law of his from last year that seized administrative authority from that court and dispersed it to trial courts across the state. The new legislation leaves intact the state supreme court's jurisdiction to entertain such a challenge, which is already pending in trial court. But it comes with a threat of a different order: if any court strikes down the earlier law, then the provisions funding the entire state judiciary will be ""declared to be null and void."" The judicial pen may be mightier than the sword, but ink costs money. Brownback should keep in mind that judicial review -- the power of courts to invalidate actions of other branches -- has been a cornerstone of the framework of separated powers, providing a crucial check on executive and legislative overreach. And as Cruz presumably laments, federal courts have been essential enforcers of the Constitution in the face of stubborn states, most notably during the Civil Rights Movement. If the political branches wield necessities like jurisdiction and budgets as weapons for browbeating courts into submission, the damage to judicial independence will in turn erode the rule of law.Still another way politicians have found to intimidate judges has been to jeopardize their jobs. A precursor to Cruz's same-sex marriage bill was the ""We the People Act,"" introduced by Texas representative Ron Paul, like Brownback a onetime presidential hopeful. Paul sought to block federal courts from hearing cases about not only sexual orientation but also reproduction or religion. Any violation of the jurisdictional bar by a judge would be, the bill warned, an ""impeachable offense.""These various threats to disrobe judges by stripping them of authority are not only unseemly but downright dangerous. If Cruz, Brownback, Paul, and other merchants of menace fear certain court decisions about facts or law, let them pound the table. But don't let them have a pound of judicial flesh."
