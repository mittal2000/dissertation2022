A 33 percent increase from that number would mean that 93 percent would be heavy.The risk for childhood obesity in particular was somewhat higher - about a 40 percent increase over kids born vaginally.Nearly one in five kids aged six to 11 is obese in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Liu said the increase in risk was modest, but that it persists into adulthood. When the researchers looked just at the studies on adults, they found that those who were born surgically were 50 percent more likely to be obese than those who were born vaginally.WHY THE LINK?It's not clear why c-section births are tied to a better chance of being heavy.One possibility relates to the bacteria babies are exposed to when they are delivered vaginally, which might affect the way they process and store food, said Liu.Additionally, Liu added, researchers have suggested that c-sections are linked with a lower concentration in the umbilical cord of a hormone important in regulating weight and with a reduced rate of breastfeeding, ""both of which are reported to be associated with an increased risk of later obesity.""Babies who are larger than normal are also more likely to be born via cesarean, but most of the studies Liu's team analyzed took into account birth weight.Cesareans have become increasingly popular, and in the U.S. now one in four babies is born through a c-section.Liu said there's been concern that some of these are unnecessary, and given the potential negative impacts on children the unneeded ones should be curbed.""In clinical practice, (the) potential adverse impact of c-section should be considered by medical staff, and non-medically indicated elective c-section should be somewhat avoided, where possible,"" Liu said.SOURCE: bit.ly/XcjOMh International Journal of Obesity, online December 4, 2012.Copyright 2012 Thomson Reuters.

1,MONEY,10 Reasons Why You're More Susceptible to Identity Theft During the Holidays,"Adrian Nazari, Contributor
Founder and CEO, CreditSesame.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-reasons-identity-theft_us_5b9c9dd8e4b03a1dcc8052dc,"During the holidays, most of us are out to get the best deal and we often choose to shop at a website that has what we're looking for at the cheapest price. Before shopping at an unfamiliar site, always check out the company first. Do they have trust seals to confirm they are legit?",2012-12-13,"The Target web site is shown on a computer screen at a coffee shop in Providence, R.I. Monday, Nov. 28, 2011. Online sales on Cyber Monday, which was started in 2005 by a retail trade group to encourage Americans to shop online on the Monday after Thanksgiving, were up mid-afternoon by 15 percent from a year ago, according to data from IBM Benchmark. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9dd82500003300362354.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft cost Americans $1.52 billion in 2011, with complaints increasing from 1.4 million to 1.8 million year-over-year. Consumers are particularly vulnerable to identity theft during the holidays because many relax their guard and substantially increase the exposure of their financial information. Here are some of the reasons you are more exposed during the holidays: 1. Influx of temporary workers who may (or may not have) had background checks.Some of the largest chains in America together will add more than 300,000 temporary workers during the 2012 holiday season to handle the predicted higher volume of shoppers. These include Target (80,000-90,000), Toys""R""Us (45,000), Amazon (50,000), Macy's (80,000), GameStop (17,000), Walmart (50,000) and Kohl's (52,700). While this is good for our economy, the influx of temporary workers can put consumers at a greater risk of identity theft because not all temporary employment agencies conduct background checks. This means that an unchecked temporary worker may be more likely to have a criminal history or be previously convicted of identity-theft related crimes. 2. You're using your credit card more frequently .According to First Data Corporation, the number of credit card transactions grew by 4.3 percent in November and an additional 6.1 percent in December of last year. Every time you hand over your credit card or personal information, there is a chance for identity theft, so pay attention at the checkout line. Your credit card may be getting copied via a handheld skimmer or a cell phone picture. It could even be getting swapped out for another similar-looking credit card. 3. You pay using credit cards you rarely use the rest of the year and may not be on top of it.Consumers often change their usual spending patterns during the holidays and may dig out an old credit card they haven't used in a while to cover holiday expenses. This year, the National Retail Federation expects holiday sales to increase 4.1 percent compared to 2011, putting the estimated total for holiday sales at $586 billion. While it's great to have a back-up credit card, consumers usually don't vigilantly check their statements and may not be as on top of the purchases they make on this card, as they are on their main credit card. This can help identity thieves get more mileage out of your credit card. Protect yourself by signing up for a free credit monitoring service from a company like Credit Sesame. Credit monitoring will alert you to changes in your credit file, so you will always know where you stand financially. 4. You may be more likely to open a store account and provide personal information to get the 10 percent store discount.When you're shopping for the holidays and spending a lot of money on your family and friends, a 10 percent or 20 percent discount can seem especially appealing. According to IndexCreditCards.com, retail store credit cards represent the greatest portion of credit cards issued, at 38.6 percent, followed by bank credit cards at 37.7 percent. The reason this can put you at risk for identity theft is that you are filling out personal information at a store, and handing it to the clerk to get approved. That sensitive information if not fully protected or destroyed, can be copied, leaving you open to identity theft. 5. You're bargain shopping on sites you may not be familiar with or know.During the holidays, most of us are out to get the best deal and we often choose to shop at a website that has what we're looking for at the cheapest price. Before shopping at an unfamiliar site, always check out the company first. Do they have trust seals to confirm they are legit? Are they a secure site using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)? Are they asking you to provide unusual information that most sites don't ask for when you're purchasing an item? If all of these things check out, then the site is likely safe to use. If not, shop for that particular item somewhere else. 6. You're shopping online more.  According to comScore, Inc., online retail sales increased 14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. When shopping online, you should consider using a credit card rather than a debit card. Credit cards have added protections through the Fair Credit Billing Act in case something goes wrong. This means you have the right to dispute charges on your credit card and can withhold payments during the investigation. If you're especially worried about identity theft, some credit card companies will generate a temporary number that can only be used for that transaction, protecting your real credit card number if a thief manages to get a hold of it. This is also a great service if you don't want a subscription to auto-renew. Banks call this service by different names including virtual account numbers (Citi) and ShopSafe (Bank of America). Know that not all credit card companies offer this service. American Express discontinued its program in 2004 and Discover stopped its program in September 2011. 7. Stores are more crowded, making it easier for pickpockets to work their magic. Window displays, glittering holiday decorations and crowded stores provide the perfect environment for pick pockets. Not only are the shoppers more likely to be interested in checking out the décor and finding the perfect present, but they're less likely to be paying attention to their purses and wallets. The crowded stores make it easier for a pickpocket to bump into you, lift your wallet and vanish into the crowd. 8. You're traveling.  Often when you're traveling to visit family during the holidays, you're dealing with very crowded airports and are connecting to unsecured airport Internet to finish up work or take care of personal to-dos before you can officially enjoy your time off. However, surfing on an unsecured network can put you at risk for identity theft via ""sidejacking."" Programs like Firesheep allow someone to capture cookies transmitted over a public Wi-Fi connection and use those cookies to gain access to the unsecured email and social networking accounts of anyone using the network. Once they have access to this information they can obtain the financial information you've provided those sites. Make sure your using encrypted sites like Gmail to prevent this and know that this can also happen to your smartphone when switching from 3G to a wireless hotspot. To help protect your phone, turn on its encryption settings. 9. You're using your smartphone more .According to Javelin Strategy & Research, smartphone owners are a third more likely to become identity theft victims than the general public due to ""careless consumer usage."" During the holidays, consumers can become more inclined to multi-task and take care of personal information (paying bills, etc.) on their phone as they wait in long checkout lines. Others may forget their phone at a bar or party, or set it down on a store shelf while grabbing an item they want to purchase. The amount of personal data and the ability to access financial information through apps on your phone can mean your identity is more likely to get stolen if you lose your phone. 10. You are doing more mail orders and getting more mail.  Think you're safe if you just pay for items via phone or mail? That is not the case. According to Javelin Strategy & Research, 13 percent of victims still lose their identity via offline purchases made via phone or mail. The U.S. Postal Service expects to deliver 17.9 billion Christmas cards, letters and packages between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve -- with the average amount of mail processed during the holidays at 560 million per day, up 6 percent from the usual 528 million pieces per day. The increased amount of ingoing and outgoing mail can leave you more vulnerable for identity theft, as thieves keep their eyes peeled for promising mail such as Christmas presents, checks sent to you, credit card offers or even outgoing bill payments. To protect yourself, consider getting mail box with a lock, always mail your mail from the post office and request a signature when sending/or receiving your packages to ensure they're received. When disposing of mail, make sure you shred anything with personal information on it (name, address, etc.)."

Gift certificates for mom and dad? These are all well and good -- but what about giving a gift that provides genuine value beyond the latest trends? Is it possible to indulge in a bit of retail therapy while still making your purchases count? Yes, it is!We've all heard the quote, ""The best gifts are tied with heartstrings."" Well, if you want to give a gift that keeps on giving, think about what would really enrich your loved ones' lives. As a seasoned financial adviser, it should come as no surprise that knowledge is power -- and that helping your loved ones live the best financial life possible is the noblest gift of all.Here are some ideas to help your loved ones get a leg-up this holiday season and set them on the path to a solid financial future. Gift Ideas for Teens: Survey after survey have proven that teenagers are lacking in financial literacy. This deficit can lead them to take out student loans they don't understand and fall into credit card debt after turning 18, as well as not understand the general value of money. Start educating them now! The Motley Fool's Investment Guide for Teens is a great resource, and is written in a style that will hold your teen's attention in what can be a rather dry subject, at least in their eyes!Furthermore, to encourage your child to open an IRA account, it makes sense to match their contributions, even if it's only a 50 percent match on the dollar. Your son or daughter should be incentivized because of the instant match, and will be more likely to save -- rather than spend -- their earnings in the future!Gift Ideas for Young Professionals: For those who are heavily focused on their careers, why not gift a free consultation with a financial adviser or a career coach? Then, perhaps even a life coach consultation, which can help you discern the next step in their life's journey.   Finally, I wouldn't feel right discussing ideas without also providing some money-saving tips for holiday shopping. Attempt to determine how much you can afford to spend before hitting the malls, if possible. Avoid the temptation to open store credit cards that carry high interest rates or other exorbitant fees, and don't be afraid to return items if you find a significant price differential at a different retailer.Lastly, Standard & Poor's Guide to Money & Investing is one of my favorite guidebooks when it comes to personal finance. I've recommended it to many clients in the past, and love how it provides a brief but thorough overview about personal finance and investing. The same goes for Zac Bissonnette's How to be Smarter, Richer and Better-Looking Than Your Parents, a fun read on how to avoid common financial pitfalls many young people encounter after their college years.Gift Ideas for Mom and Dad: Many of us are living longer than ever, which makes taking care of ourselves of the utmost importance. For less than $50.00 per year, you can give your parents a subscription to the Harvard Health Letter and the Mayo Clinic Health Letter, which will provide them with invaluable information about health, medicine and how to live the best life going forward.The holidays might just be my favorite time of year. That said, I've always looked at gifts as an opportunity to improve the lives of those closest to me in unique and long-lasting ways. It's better to give a thoughtful gift that leaves a lasting impression, than an expensive one that's soon forgotten!"

Rosenbaum and Ashley Hebert tied the knot earlier this month in Pasadena, Calif. The couple, who met and got engaged on ""The Bachelorette,"" married in front of fellow ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" cast members, including Emily Maynard, Molly and Jason Mesnick and Ryan and Trista Sutter. Here, the newlyweds open up to HuffPost Weddings about their relationship, their MyRegistry.com wedding registry and their down-to-earth home life.1. J.P. loves a night on the town more than Ashley does.  ""I [Ashley] am such a homebody. There is nothing I love more than a night in cuddled up on the couch. J.P. always wants to make plans months in advance for dinners and outings, but I usually stay in!""  2. The couple now celebrates both Jewish and Catholic traditions.  “Now that we are working on building our own home, we’ve incorporated both Jewish and Catholic symbols and traditions into our household. In fact, when we created our wedding registry at MyRegistry.com, it was important that we include a few key items to incorporate J.P.’s Jewish heritage into our home.”  3. J.P. and Ashley share an equal amount of closet space.  ""J.P. is the true definition of a New York fashionista! He has a pretty amazing wardrobe consisting of the most amazing suits, shoes, cuff links, etc. We share an equal amount of closet space, but I'm pretty sure he has more shoes than I [Ashley] do.""  4. Ashley has a fear of flying, while J.P. loves it.  ""Despite the thousands of miles I've [Ashley] spent flying these past couple of years, I can't shake my fear of turbulence! I know it's silly, and I sometimes can talk myself out of it, but as soon as I feel turbulence, I think there is something majorly wrong...and I've been on some scary flights! J.P., on the other hand, can fly on Friday the 13th, through a thunderstorm, with endless turbulence and remain completely calm.”  5. J.P. is the chef; Ashley is the maid.  “I [Ashley] am a terrible cook. The first time I made a dish for J.P. he told me ‘it was a good first effort.’ Since then, we've decided that J.P. does all the cooking, while I do all the cleaning. I love cleaning!""  6. Even though Ashley doesn’t cook, she collects cookware.  “Ashley has cooked two meals in one and a half years, although she has an obsession with collecting the fancy Mauviel line of cookware, as you can see on our wedding registry at MyRegistry.com. She says they are only for show. I’d [J.P.] say to show just how little she cooks!  7. Ashley has an assortment of nicknames for J.P. that he prefers she not mention in public!  ""I [Ashley] promised J.P. I would not call him these nicknames in public, so I’m trying to keep this promise. But behind closed doors, it's fair game!""  8. We have our own language.  ""Whatever the word of the day/week is, we somehow combine it with either one of these two words: ""snuffleupogus"" for an adjective or ""fluffernutter"" for a noun. Most recently, we turned ""wife"" and ""husband"" into “wifernutter” and “hubbernutter.""  9. J.P. and Ashley never sleep next to each other in bed.  ""Though this may come as a surprise, we never sleep next to each other in our king size bed because our four-pound Yorkie, Boo, insists on sleeping between us. We're lucky if we can kiss goodnight without having her jump in for the block!""   10. Ashley thinks she is a comedian.  ""Nearly all of our disagreements end the exact same way in less than 30 minutes, with Ashley doing something silly or making fun of me [J.P.]. I laugh and the argument is over. Ashley usually will make a funny face, or do a funny dance, or even just take my side of the argument and make fun of it. I try to hold back from laughing because I think I'm upset, but I'm never able to.""""The Bachelorette: Ashley & J.P.’s Wedding"" airs Dec. 16 on ABC.Click through the slideshow below to see photos of the couple."

The Swedish retailer has applied to invest a total of Euro 1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) to open 25 stores in India, India's Commerce Ministry Anand Sharma said Friday, June 22, 2012. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9c5f1f00005100214a60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Ikea,I just wanted to thank you for hijacking our weekend and providing my husband and I with a few hundred more grey hairs. As working parents of five children, we were truly delighted to dedicate our weekend to bunk bed assembly, rather than enjoying quality time together as a family. We were especially thrilled that as the moon rose on Sunday evening, the bunk beds still lay strewn in pieces and we had to farm out our triplets to other rooms of the house in sleeping bags. Do have any idea what kind of disappointment this is to our trio of 4-year olds? Or what that disappointment sounds like? Imagine heartbroken wails, whines and tears; a symphony of agony as our little fellas faced the dark alone on the floor rather than snuggled together in the ""big boy beds"" they so eagerly and patiently anticipated.With all of this in mind, we'd like to take this opportunity to applaud you for astutely recognizing that most bunk bed consumers have large families and busy lives and, as such, the luxury of time to labor feverishly over the fourteen thousand pieces you so thoughtfully provided for building the beds. We especially appreciate the effort you put into creating the user-friendly, simple and intuitive assembly manual. When we saw the first page -- the one with an X through one stick figure and circle around two stick figures -- we gave each other a big hug and jumped right in, knowing from the sweet diagram that this was a job for two people in love. When darkness fell and we were still surrounded by bits of wood and bags of bolts, we swore and snarled at each other and considered burning your manual, having learned from a grueling day that it is woefully deceptive. Building a bunk bed is not a job for team of two, but rather, for a group of at least three, each of whom, ideally, has an engineering degree. Next time you update the manual, please consider adding a third stick figure (at a minimum) and a diploma to the diagram; this will save other harried time-pressed parents from the frustration and short-term harm our marriage experienced today.As dusk began to fall, we recognized we needed that third set of hands and called in my Dad in to help. He was impressed by how you cleverly numbered the wooden dowels, screws and other assorted pieces pictured in the manual; he was far less impressed when he, as we had, searched for the corresponding numbers on the dowels and screws themselves and realized they did not exist. That was a mean trick. It literally drove my father to drink. And, not wanting to see a grown man drink alone, we joined him. Needless to say, this didn't make the assembly any easier. What would make it easier would be if you could separate the thousands of pieces and place them in numbered bags that correspond to the numbers in your maddening manual. Perhaps you were being environmentally conscious by putting approximately 14,462 pieces into one large bag rather than several small ones? Perhaps you thought it would be fun for parents under pressure to build a bed before sundown to revisit the puzzle-solving joy of their youth? Whatever your intentions, they were wrong. We suggest you buy the baggies, number the parts and save the sanity of parents the world over who, like us, have been wooed by your Swedish design and undeniable affordability. As for us, three weeks have passed since I first started this note of gratitude. Though we purchased two sets of bunks, we've only built one. It took roughly eighteen hours. So, here we are, three weeks later, with three boys in one set of bunks. How does it work? There's one fella up top and two on the bottom. Which was all well and good until one of the bottom boys barfed this week. On the bunk, bed and brother. All we can say is that when they grow up and wonder why they shared a bed and why one was the recipient of the others regurgitated hot dog, we are telling them to call you... and hoping they will have a better experience than we did with your customer service line.

It snowed on November 1st and the sun went on sabbatical until May. I'd grown up in Philadelphia, had lived in Hershey, Pennsylvania and had spent a few years in Chicago, so it wasn't really the cold that battered me so much as the gray. But the holiday season, coupled with the wonder of childhood, had a way of brightening even the darkest of cityscapes.It was easy to forget that chill as I cozied up with my 4-year-old son on the sofa that backed up against our a floor-to-ceiling window. The hill on which we lived gave us a view of two streets lined with houses. On this night, most homes were flickering with Christmas lights. They flickered and limmered and we had a front row seat. The snow reflected not only the moonlight, but those strings of icicle lights and flashing North Pole signs. While I admired the fleeting beauty in my neighborhood, my son was contemplating the flip side of an age-old childhood quandary. ""How will Santa know not to come here?"" He was as serious as a 4-year-old can be.We didn't have a chimney, but that didn't matter. The even more relevant fact that we are Jewish and so do not celebrate Christmas in any way, shape or form -- even as a secular holiday -- was not sufficient enough to quell the fears of my pensive preschooler.As a mom, I was at a fork in the road of parenting. I could have very well told him that parents leave all the presents, and that Santa isn't real, just a nice guy in a costume. I could have explained that parents do that for their children because it's fun and part of the Christmas tradition in our country. But, those words stuck in my throat. That wasn't what he was asking. He believed. He was 4. And even though it wasn't my myth to perpetuate, I did not want him to lose his sense of awe and wonder. Even of Santa. He was not hoping for a few misbegotten toys to show up on Christmas morning, although I'm sure he found himself somewhat distracted at the idea of yet another Power Ranger. He wasn't secretly wishing for a tree, nor did he want to leave cookies and milk ""just in case."" He'd been showered with gifts for eight nights of Hanukkah and he attended a Jewish preschool. I knew he wasn't feeling deprived or left out of anything. At that point in his life, he didn't know anyone who celebrated Christmas. To him, the thought of a big man in a red suit coming into his house was troubling, even scary. He wanted my reassurance there was no way that guy and his sleigh were going to land on our roof and traipse through our little bungalow. And while it was my job to quell his fears, I did not want to burst a childhood bubble of belief. ""See those lights?"" I pointed out the window. He nodded. ""Santa only goes to the houses with the lights.""""Oh,"" he said.A good save.When my son lost his first tooth later that year, the same thing happened with the Tooth Fairy. My kid was mortified. He wanted no part of some stranger coming into his room in the middle of the night, flying no less, and sticking her hand under his pillow! Money or not, this was just not an idea he was buying into. So, we put his pillow on the kitchen table with the tooth under it. And, I'll be darned, that Tooth Fairy is one smart magical creature. She knew just where to go. Tooth fairies, we learned, are very accommodating. I think about these events every time the Santas reemerge in the malls and on the street corners. I smile. I wonder what I'd have done if we did indeed celebrate Christmas. Would I have dressed my son in his plaid finery and plunked him on St. Nick's lap at the local mall, screaming in terror? You know, the way he did when he I took him for a hair cut? I'll never know.What I do know is that I smile when I see the adorably dressed, color coordinated tikes lined up, sucking on their candy canes ready to meet the big guy in the red suit. And I love teasing my son about sitting on Santa's lap now. I promise Santa would be the one shaking in his boots as my almost 21-year-old asked for what he really wants. (That's something I really do not want to ponder.) My son, who stands 5'9"" to my 5'3"", still smiles like a little boy when I tell him these tales of his long-ago worries and questions. His stature has changed, yet not so much his sweetness. I've never been sorry that I rewrote the script for some childhood characters to meet the needs of our family at that moment. If there's one thing I'm sure of it's this: things change. And that's one reason I'm confident in saying that anyone who wants to leave money under my son's pillow, or come down the chimney and leave presents, is more than welcome to do so."

But as my nieces and nephews become teenagers, they seem busy with their own lives. I don't know what to do to get closer, other than friending them on Facebook. Do you think having relationships with their aunts and uncles matters to kids?I absolutely love this question, because it speaks to one of the most fundamental beliefs I have about parenting: Children are meant to be raised in a village or tribe.It's not easy being a kid in today's world. While it's true that growing children have always had to deal with peer pressure, family challenges and complex social lives, today's youngsters are also having to navigate exposure to alcohol and drugs at ever younger ages, highly sexualized media messages and the influence of a digital world that none of us quite know how to manage.As youngsters grow up, they may be unwilling to turn to their parents as they navigate the minefield of adolescence, especially if they think Mom or Dad will react angrily if they reveal something upsetting. So who do children look to for advice? Their friends. And while there are certainly times that it's great to have a buddy to vent to about your latest heartbreak or the stress of finals, youngsters need the counsel of wise adults when the going gets tough. Here are some suggestions for deepening the connection you have with your nieces and nephews, both as a cheerleader who celebrates their successes and as a trusted confidante they can turn to when they need the sound advice of a caring adult. • Spend time with your nieces and nephews. Even if they seem busy, most kids (heck, most adults!) find it enormously flattering when someone shows interest in getting to know them better. Whether it's asking your outdoorsy niece to go for a hike or inviting your nephew to join you for some live music, if you extend an invitation to do something they enjoy, you'll probably get a ""Sure, I'd love to!""  • Stay in touch. Skype, Facebook, texting and emails are all ways to let your nieces and nephews know that you're thinking of them. It can make a world of difference to a youngster to know that a beloved aunt or uncle cares enough to send a ""Hi, how ya doing?"" text message. You'll never know if your thoughts of kindness might arrive just as they're dealing with something difficult.  • Offer to help with school work. If you have an area of expertise that one of your nieces or nephews needs help with, let them know you'd love to give them a hand. Better yet, combine an afternoon of tutoring with a meal that the two of you cook up together and you will have created a memorable experience that will nourish them physically, emotionally and intellectually. If you're a parent and don't have dependable relatives who can take your kids under their wing now and then, make a point of expanding your tribe to include trustworthy adults who can become unofficial aunties and uncles to your children. The operative word, of course, being trustworthy. We're all sadly aware of instances where a relative, coach or friendly neighbor has fostered a connection with a youngster in order to establish an inappropriate, harmful relationship. Listen to your instincts and do your homework before giving any adult access to your children. But don't let fear keep your kids from having relationships with genuinely upstanding, responsible adults.  When I was growing up, I was fortunate to have a beloved family friend, Lillie, who offered me priceless wisdom and guidance when I was reluctant to turn to my parents. Her influence remains an integral part of what has been best about my life. And I have to admit, as much as I love it when my son confides in me, I take great comfort in the fact that he has close relationships with his uncles, aunts and adult family friends. I hope you find a way to be the loving Auntie you imagined you would be when your siblings had children. You will no doubt be enriching the lives of your nieces and nephews, and they will surely enrich yours, as well.Do you have a question for the Parent Coach?

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9cbb2400005000534422.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When was the last time you received a holiday card that started like this? Dear Friends and Family,  The year, 2011, brought no great surprises or triumphs. Jordan has remained an average student who gets mostly B's. Ashley tried out for varsity field hockey but didn't make it. She didn't score any goals this season playing on junior varsity. Jim is still in middle management and hasn't been promoted in the company where he has worked as an engineer for 20 years. I still spend my days driving carpools, cooking meals and packing lunches. We didn't go on any vacations this year... The fact is, very few families are that honest in communicating their mediocrity. This time of year, we receive realms of boastful tidings intended to bring good cheer. These are communicated, of course, in the form of that annual holiday card, intended to let everyone know all that the various family members have accomplished. For some reason, many people feel the need to take stock of their good fortunes as the year draws to a close, and those usually translate to material accomplishments. We hear about children who have excelled in school, in sports and are now receiving college acceptances. We hear about their trophies, fellowships and competitive internships; their eye-opening trips abroad. We are expected to marvel at parents who have soared to the top in their career, climbed Mount Everest or have been recognized as a leader in their field. It's as if these kinds of developments translate to a greater self-worth. Only toward the end of the cards do we hear the casual mention of good health and happiness that they're grateful for and that they wish for you. We can witness this polished and persistent delivery of good cheer 365 days a year now, thanks to Facebook, where everyone seems to always present their best self, free of the wrinkles that real-life travails inevitably bring.   As a writer by trade, I have considered sending the annual holiday card. It would, after all, be so much easier than my usual practice of scribbling a few hasty lines of personal greetings on each of the 100 cards I send. But I have flinched at the prospect of a card that tells only of the bliss we've experienced in the past year, free of the challenges. I recall receiving a card one year that I treasured most. It described the extended family's serious chain of illnesses, then concluded by saying how grateful they were for their healthy and happy children.   I'm not saying that holiday cards should be morose. But when I get those cards that list all the great things, it does make me feel a bit inadequate, instead of treasuring what I'm most grateful for.   I admit I was once consumed with conveying information about the perfect report cards, the trophies and the original piano compositions that received accolades. But time -- and plenty of ups and downs -- has reinforced my belief that it's the basics that I cherish this holiday season: a terrific husband, three amazing children, great friends and the most supportive extended family. I know that will make for a very boring holiday letter. So, as usual, I won't be writing one.  This year, don't beat yourself up if you don't get around to sending that holiday card. Instead, hug your children tight. Use the time saved over addressing envelopes to indulge in stress-free family get-togethers. Focus less on the unearned trophies, missed soccer goals and family squabbles over issues so small you can't even remember them. That's my priority this year. My wish is that you can enjoy the same. Here's to a boastful-free holiday season."

They demand a huge amount of time and effort. If you're remarried with kids or step-kids or you and your husband share custody of the kids, holiday planning can be overwhelming.Our book, Love For Grown-Ups, is a relationship guide written for women who married a little later in life. It may be a first, second or even third marriage that took place sometime after the bride turned thirty-five. We interviewed women all over the country about their marriages. Here are some of their very good ideas for making the holidays fun rather than stressful.If children are involved in your holiday plans, work that out first.  Ask some key questions: How long and when will the kids or step-kids be staying with you? When and how long will your kids be with their father and when will they be with you? There's nothing worse than getting tickets for the Ice Follies for everyone and then finding that your ex has made reservations to take them to the beach that weekend. Make sure you get dates and give dates to all involved parties (and if the kids are teenagers, include them in this too).Get dates in your calendar as far in advance as possible. Beginning in October, our calendars fill up with dates right through the new year. We know that it's difficult to get the children's schedules early, but you can start with your calendar and go from there. Pour a cup of coffee and sit down with your calendar and edit it. That's right -- separate the ""have-to"" events and obligations from the ""want-tos"". There are obligations that you must fulfill, but be honest about what you really have to do. Schedule nothing one day or one weekend.  One woman we spoke to schedules a day or a weekend during the holidays with nothing on the calendar. If it's a day when the kids are with your ex, use it for yourself (you might want to think of this as a Christmas present to YOU!) But something magical can always happen when you and your family are spontaneous. If the children are with you, stay home and bake cookies or watch your favorite holiday movies. It may very well become the calm place in the middle of so many hectic weeks. On the flip side, if you receive a last minute invitation that is appealing, you're able to go.Make a gift list and check it twice. We understand that you want to give personal and unique gifts. Maybe save that creative impulse for people's birthdays and for thee holidays, determine the one gift for this year. For instance, exotic fruit baskets or a calendar that you've created on Shutterfly or fancy chocolates for your gift list. Some of the women in our book gave gift certificates to book stores or Amazon to the teenagers on their gift lists. You could go further and make a donation to a charity in your friends' names; everyone appreciates that. Have a family ""Kris Kringle"" name swap, where on Thanksgiving you pick a name from a hat and that's the person you buy a gift for with a predetermined price range.Don't feel you have to celebrate a holiday on the exact day. Some of the women we interviewed found that their husband's ex-spouse was adamant about having the kids on Christmas day or on Thanksgiving. You can celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve or the weekend after Christmas. One woman we know has all her kids on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Some families alternate holidays. We have learned that celebrations don't have to happen on the day of the event. Don't be rigid about the date if it is going to start an argument. Being flexible makes it easier on all of you -- and the important thing is to enjoy the holiday!See people who make you happy. Try to get together with friends with whom you have no issues. Take it a step further and go to a festive restaurant so that nobody has to cook, clean or decorate. Find a pocket of time to raise a glass and have some laughs.Create a greeting card list that consists of only the people you don't see during the holidays. You can deliver your holiday wishes in person to the people you do see!Give yourself a gift. Create an oasis for you. Schedule a manicure and pedicure or sneak away to a café and read a book. Whatever it is that feels like a mini vacation for you is the gift that you should give yourself.How do you manage the holiday frenzy? How do you thrive -- and not just survive -- the holidays? What plans do you make?
