LynchWASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White on Tuesday responded directly to allegations in Michael Lewis' new book about high-frequency trading markets.""The markets are not rigged,"" she told a U.S. House of Representatives panel. ""The U.S. markets are the strongest and most reliable in the world.""White's comments come nearly a month after Lewis' ""Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,"" was published. The book has re-ignited a fierce debate over the role of high-speed trading, and whether it may leave some investors at an unfair disadvantage.Lewis alleges that high-speed traders are engaged in a form of front-running, in which the firms are able to quickly identify an investor's desire to buy stock, rush to buy it first and then sell it back at a higher price.Since the book was released, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney General, New York state prosecutors and the SEC have all confirmed they are investigating the practices of high-speed firms.White on Tuesday tried to soothe some concerns about whether firms are wrongfully trading ahead of others.She said it ""is not unlawful insider-trading.""There has been some confusion between the idea of having an early sneak-peak at data, versus cases where firms are able to react more quickly to publicly available data.

The latest numbers suggest, however, youth turnout could dip below the level of 2010, when 31 percent said in February of that year they'd definitely vote, and about 23 percent actually made it to the polls. In 2010, Republicans retook the House. And this year, the potential drop-off is troubling for Democrats, who worry that the failure of young adults and others in their party's base to vote in November could cost the party the Senate.The new poll found young Democrats to be especially unmotivated: Those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 were 9 percentage points less likely than those who voted for Mitt Romney to say they're definitely voting this time.""Young people need to feel like they're able to make a difference in order to be engaged,"" said John Della Volpe, polling director for the Harvard Institute of Politics. ""Frankly, I don't think that either the Republicans or the Democrats have really tried to inspire and engage people like they have in the past."" The survey found that adults under 30, especially Democrats, consider income inequality a major issue and that 63 percent of Democrats believe raising the minimum wage would be effective in reducing the wealth gap. Party leaders hope a focus on the minimum wage will drive their voters to the polls, although in a recent New Republic article looking at Democratic strategy, journalist Sasha Issenberg points to some research that finds such messaging ""does little to influence a person’s likelihood of actually voting.""If it's hard to predict what exactly would persuade young Americans to turn out, it's also uncertain how accurate they are in assessing their own chances of voting. Americans are not particularly good at predicting whether they will vote.The survey's results on possible turnout, however, point to a sense of disaffection among young adults that's borne out elsewhere in the poll. Trust in institutions, including the president, Congress and the Supreme Court, is at a low ebb. Compared with 2010, young adults are somewhat more likely to feel that people like them don't have a say in the government's actions and that political involvement rarely yields tangible results. Fifty-eight percent said elected officials don't share their priorities, up from 51 percent in 2010.The Harvard poll surveyed 3,058 Americans ages 18 to 29 between March 22 and April 4. The poll recruited participants by phone and mail, and then surveyed them online."

They want to restrict everything because they're headed towards the 'glorious past',"" Anton Nosik, a prominent Russian blogger and online media expert, told Reuters.""China is much more liberal than what Russia wants to achieve,"" he said, describing the move as unconstitutional.The pressure group Reporters Without Borders (RWB) said the law was an attempt to increase control of online content.The State Duma lower house has already backed the law and it now needs Putin's signature to go into force. Both chambers are dominated by the United Russia party loyal to the president.The new rules will require popular bloggers to register by name with Russia's communications oversight agency and conform to regulations on the mass media.The Kremlin denies allegations of censorship or pressure on the media and says Russians have the right to express their opinions and stage protests. CIA PROJECTBut Putin has described the Internet as a CIA project and parliament has approved moves requiring social media websites to keep their servers in Russia and save information about users for at least six months.With 61 million users, Russia is Europe's fastest-growing Internet audience, according to a 2013 report by industry body comScore, and blogs have been seen by Putin's opponents as one of the few popular platforms beyond the Kremlin's reach.The editor of a popular Internet news site, Lenta.ru, was dismissed this year and independent TV Dozhd has gone off the air. The head of VKontakte, Russia's answer to Facebook, has been ousted and fled the country.The government has also blocked access to the Internet sites of Kremlin critics Alexei Navalny and Garry Kasparov because they ""contained calls for illegal activity"".Navalny was one of the leaders of the anti-Putin protests of 2011-12, which were organised largely through social media sites and blogs. Navalny has further used his own blog to highlight state corruption and undermine United Russia in a campaign that helped establish him as an opposition leader.Russia's leading blog platform, LiveJournal, appears to be standing up to the new rules.The day after the blogging law was approved by the lower house, LiveJournal director Dmitry Pilipenko said the site would no longer display the number of subscribers a blog had if the figure exceeded 2,500.Pilipenko said ""all coincidences are accidental"" but the timing of the announcement means many have seen the decision as a bid to protect LiveJournal's users. The decision followed a similar move by Russia's biggest search engine Yandex.These steps will not stop Russia's media watchdog monitoring popular bloggers as it can obtain information on readership statistics independently, Roscomnadzor head Alexander Zharov said.""LiveJournal and Yandex's move to hide blog statistics is just an emotional decision,"" local media quoted Zharov as saying.(Editing by Timothy Heritage/Mark Heinrich)"

Seriously?""It was bound to happen sooner or later. Someone mentioned that Hillary Rodham Clinton was going to become a grandmother this year and the detrimental remarks were being made. I was at a black-tie affair with my husband and unfortunately, had to overhear the above remarks from a man in his 30s who obviously thought being a grandparent meant that a person's personal and professional lives were over. Disregarding my husband's ""don't-say-anything-let's-just-walk-away"" look, I turned around to Mr. Mouth and asked him what being a mother, wife, or grandmother had to do with being president? He was surprised at my question.""Well, she'd be more interested in the baby than running the country, right? I mean that's what women do. They pretty much give up everything else when they become grandmothers. It's a female hormonal thing.""Right, sure. Female hormonal gets us every time and makes us suspect in the eyes of the ""experts"" on what we can and can't do.Truthfully, the experts don't have to be male. Some women have also taken the misguided stance that grandmotherhood will make Hillary less capable of running a country. Linda Feldmann, staff reporter for The Christian Monitor wrote this in her piece on the announcement of the impending grandmotherhood: ""If we had to guess, we'd say that Hillary Clinton will be a tad less interested in running for president now that she's about to be a grandmother.""Excuse me, but am I missing something here? Why should her becoming a grandmother change her political goal? Certainly, no one would think to play the grandparent card adversely with a male candidate. If anything is mentioned at all about a man running for office who is a grandfather, it is always mentioned in positive political statements. ""A strong man, a man of courage and conviction, a loving husband, father, and grandfather."" No mention being made that perhaps he will be a ""tad less"" interested in running for president now that he's a grandfather.The Washington Monthly, in an article titled, ""Nana for President"" written by Haley Sweetland Edwards, made this statement: ""She will also likely provoke a national water cooler debate, as no male candidate would, over whether she is too involved in her grandchild's life, or, more likely, not involved enough"" and posed this question that people may ask, ""How can she have time to be a good grandmother when she's out running for president?""I seriously doubt that anyone would ask this question concerning a male candidate. Mitt Romney was surrounded by grandkids during his presidential run and no one ever ventured the question, let alone the thought, that he might not be a good grandfather or was not involved enough in their lives.Is it Hillary's age combined with the term ""grandmother"" that may make some pundits speak incorrectly? Being 66 is not old and being a grandparent at that age is normal. However, that age-number seems to define each gender differently. A man may be considered seasoned and still young at that age and the idea that he is a a grandparent seems to afford him a solid trusted image. But 66, for a woman in the political arena (and other arenas as well), is a different story. Unlike a man, a woman's ""shelf-life"" seems to be limited when she is described, even in her 60s, as a grandmother. And unfortunately, Americans seem to favor the word ""grandma"" over grandmother. No matter how many fond memories you may have of your grandmother, the word grandma is a synonym for old lady. Look at news stories. Whenever a woman of a certain age with grandchildren is headline news, the headline invariably will refer to her as ""Grandma."" You can win the Nobel Prize for Peace and the headline will read, ""Grandma Gets Peace Prize!"" Fight off a mugger and even if you are the CEO of a national company, the headline will read, ""Grandma Fights Off Attacker."" I'm playing this for laughs, but there is a solid grain of truth here.The idea that being a grandmother somehow must limit a woman's goals in life is unfair and unjust. Especially in 2014, when more older women are healthier, are presidents of companies, lawyers, doctors, etc. To discount their expertise in any area is wrong. I certainly hope Hillary runs in 2016. It would be good to have a woman with her intelligence and political savvy as the first woman president of the U.S.. Being a grandmother is only one title women have in life and it is a title not a detriment to a personal and professional goal.Read ""Welcome to Hell"" by Kristen Houghton You may email Kristen Houghton at kch@kristenhoughton.com© 2014 copyright Kristen HoughtonEarlier on Huff/Post50:"
7,BLACK VOICES,"Sterling's Gold: Roger, Donald, and Us","Oluseyi Fayanju, ContributorFormer fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sterlings-gold-roger-dona_b_5223612.html,"If our society complacently allows power brokers like Donald Sterling to go unpunished for their prejudice, it will be maddeningly difficult for America to progress towards a more just and equitable future.",2014-04-28,"FILE - In this Dec. 19, 2011, file photo, Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling looks on during the second half of an NBA preseason basketball game between the Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers in Los Angeles. The NBA is investigating a report of an audio recording in which a man purported to be Sterling makes racist remarks while speaking to his girlfriend. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement Saturday, APril 26, 2014, that the league is in the process of authenticating the validity of the recording posted on TMZ's website. Bass called the comments &quot;disturbing and offensive.&quot; (AP Photo/Danny Moloshok, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badf94e2400003100964ca9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ensemble cast of Mad Men is already recognized as one of the best in modern television, and the character of Roger Sterling, portrayed by John Slattery, is a highlight among them. Entitled and insouciant, the pleasure-seeking Sterling embodies the casually prejudiced and socially unperturbed Northeastern elite whose control of corporate board rooms and other chambers of power sat unchallenged until the convulsive changes of the 1960s. Many of his more memorable musings on people are compiled into a book of scene-stealing quotes entitled Sterling's Gold, in reference to a biography written by the character several seasons ago.It would be comforting if the racist views of rich and powerful men were limited to screenplays about America's past. However, the recent release of sound bites allegedly attributed to another wealthy and influential Sterling have rekindled conversation about how far we have moved on corporate race relations since the Civil Rights Movement. More importantly, the Sterling situation has underscored the need for further action on confronting privilege coupled with prejudice. Donald Sterling, the Los Angeles Clippers owner in hot water over racist comments he reportedly made during a phone call to an ex-lover, is, admittedly, quite different from Roger. First, Donald Sterling is not the cocooned product of Manhattan society, but the son of a humble immigrant household who spent his earliest years in working-class neighborhoods of Chicago and East Los Angeles. Second, the modern-day Sterling, who changed his surname from Tokowitz in an attempt at assimilation, earned his fortune speculating on Southern California real estate, as opposed to inheriting a stake in a Madison Avenue advertising firm as was the case with Roger. Lastly, while the fictional Sterling's rakish ways and blasé attitude towards life are entertaining to some viewers, the reality of Donald Sterling's shady business practices and complicated personal life are more likely to elicit disgust or comparisons to the worst sets of villains from Dickens' canon.Despite their differences, the two Sterlings are interesting subjects for comparison because of what they have in common -- money, power and prejudice. If we think about the socioeconomic shifts that have taken place in America since the Civil Rights Era, we can easily see that such progress happened in spite of the best efforts of people like Roger and Donald who resisted change through their indifference or outright ignorance. It is Roger Sterling who, in Mad Men's opening episode, neither knows nor cares if the firm has any Jews on its payroll, and who, along with the rest of the firm's partners, quietly brings a mail room employee named David Cohen to a C-suite pitch in a blatantly forced effort to project an image of diversity to a Jewish-owned department store. Several seasons later, Roger Sterling, by then married to Jane Siegel, a younger Jewish woman who served as a colleague's secretary, entertains his work friends at a Derby Day party by donning blackface and singing ""Old Kentucky Home."" As the decade progresses, Roger embraces experimentation with drugs and novel sexual practices, but his increasing openness to the hedonistic aspects of hippie life is not matched by an interest in exposing himself to the sociopolitical movements sweeping the country. Left to this Sterling, any dissimilar people hired by his firm would have remained in subordinate roles, low on the pay scale, and even lower in influence. By the time we reach the late 1960s, Roger finds himself being chastised by co-workers for his prejudiced views about Japanese and Jewish people, indicating how changing attitudes have subtly shifted the ground under Sterling's feet. It is disturbing to recognize that the latter-day Sterling experienced little comparable censure from his corporate colleagues for his racist views, despite being 50 years removed from his fictional counterpart. Sitting at the top of a basketball organization worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Donald Sterling has been sued for discriminatory practices against minority employees of the L.A. Clippers, and the nuggets of his perspectives that have leaked to the wider public through sworn affidavits reveal a man whose views would have been retrograde even by the low standards of the mid-1960s. In spite of this, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has given Sterling and his repugnant record a pass since he purchased the Clippers in 1981. Former NBA Commissioner David Stern was probably not ignorant of this man's transgressions, but similar to Major League Baseball's kid-glove handling of Marge Schott and the Cincinnati Reds franchise during the 1980s and early 1990s, the NBA was fine with Donald's behavior until it was widely exposed. Few questions have been asked about why the NBA was tolerant of a man who clearly exhibited little tolerance for people who were different from him.Sterling's startling views on race carried over into other aspects of his life. The real estate operation he controls has been accused of segregating potential tenants on the basis of race in direct violation of decades-old laws against such practices. While Donald Sterling dismissively talked about the vulgar habits of African-Americans and Mexicans, he bizarrely brought a woman who identifies as black and Latina as his courtside arm candy to Clipper games, weirdly paralleling anti-Semitic Roger's relationship with Jane Siegel. Sterling hypocritically complained about the laziness of various ethnic groups while a diverse roster of Clipper players led by a black head coach worked its way through the playoffs, bringing a perennially basement-dwelling franchise legions of new fans in a Los Angeles desperate for a winning basketball team. Donald Sterling's horrible comments provide a window into the mind of a man who, by virtue of his fortune and influence, has the power to shape policy in one of the America's major sports leagues and politics in the funding free-for-all that the Supreme Court has created in the wake of the McCutcheon decision.I am horrified that a person like the present owner of the L.A. Clippers could wield so much clout, but I feel that the Donald Sterling tape, like Sterling's Gold, has inherent value. It reminds us that while we have made tremendous progress since the era of Roger Sterling, we still live in a country where discrimination and its after-effects remain very real concerns. If our society complacently allows power brokers like Donald Sterling to go unpunished for their prejudice, it will be maddeningly difficult for America to progress towards a more just and equitable future."

A Man in Chair (Larry Raben) seeks to lift his spirits by listening to a recording of a 1928 musical, ""The Drowsy Chaperone"". In the musical, stage actress Janet Van de Graaff (Jessica Ernest) plans to marry oil tycoon Robert Martin (Eric Michael Parker). By the end, the Man manages to shake his blues. To say the marriage doesn't go off without a hitch is the understatement of the century.Under James W. Gruessing's direction for the Norris Center for the Performing Arts, ""The Drowsy Chaperone"", written by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, with music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, is a spectacular production. It's funny and wistful. It's vibrant and extravagant. And it's guaranteed to wipe a frown off any face. Its costumes, songs, and dances reflect the stylish look and larger than life feel of the Roaring Twenties. They also capture its rhythm and verve.The ensemble cast is outlandish. It includes frantic Robert's best man George (Chris Daniels) and Janet's bibulous Drowsy Chaperone (Tracy Lore). They face the impossible task of keeping groom and bride on track. There's Broadway producer Mr. Feldzieg (Greg Nicholas). He wants to stop the marriage lest two Gangsters (Jon M. Wailin and Adam Trent) fill him full of lead. There's aspiring actress Kitty (Noelle Marion), who wants to take Janet's place on Broadway. There's the ludicrous Latin lover Adolpho (Jeff Max). He doesn't cuckold Robert but sure made someone happy. There's the long-suffering house staff, Mrs. Tottendale (Lindsay Brooks) and the Underling (Danny Michaels). And, because you can't have a Roaring Twenties Musical without an aviatrix, there's Trix (Lindsey Martin). Then there's Raben's Walter Mitty-esque Man. His is the most spectacular performance in an evening full of spectacular performances. For most of the production, he's flamboyant, impassioned, and opinionated. Raben nails the contrast between the Man's vivid imagination and his dull, house mouse life. When he soars, he's infectious, hilarious, and affectionate. You can hear it in his voice. You can see it in his gestures and the way he moves around the room to watch the story. But when life, in the person of a building superintendent coming to fix a fuse, interrupts his rapture, he shuts down. It's like watching someone cycle through a bipolar episode. The effect is chilling. ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" is a love letter to musical theatre. With spot-on casting and evocative staging, it shows how musical theatre can transform a daily grind into a breezy love story. Just like the Man in the Chair, we become enchanted spectators, at least until we have to leave.Performances are 8pm, Friday and Saturday, 2pm, Sunday. The show runs until May 11. Tickets are $45 adults and $25 children 12 and under. The Center is located at 27570 Norris Center Drive, Rolling Hills Estates, 90274.

Anti-China sentiments run high in the Philippines, which is locked in a showdown with the Asian giant over disputed atolls in the South China Sea, part of a proliferation of maritime hotspots that has stoked Asian tensions. During an Asian tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, Obama has repeatedly warned that small nations should not be bullied by larger ones, a clear reference to China's increasingly sharp geopolitical elbows. ""Disputes need to be resolved peacefully, without intimidation or coercion, and... all nations must abide by international rules and international norms,"" Obama said in Malaysia Sunday. That is also a message that has resonance in America's East-West showdown with Russia over Ukraine -- a row to which Obama has had to return time an again during his Asian journey.- Simmering disputes -Opening his trip Obama made clear that US defence treaties with Japan did cover disputed islands long administered by Tokyo in the East China Sea, which are known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyus in China. The Philippines has its own territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea -- notably over the Second Thomas Shoal, an outpost in the remote Spratly Islands.US officials have not been so specific over perceptions of their obligations towards Manila on territorial disputes -- but it is clear they do not believe them covered by the American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines. ""With respect to some of the difficult territorial issues that are being worked through, it is hard to speculate on those because they involve hypothetical situations in the South China Sea,"" said deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes. ""The US Japan agreement has very specific coverage of territory under Japanese administration. ""Some of the disputes in the South China Sea raise more hypothetical circumstances."" In essence, the difference lies in the fact that Japan already administers the Senkakus/Diaoyus while the status of other islands and reefs is disputed -- even though they lie within the Philippines' internationally-mandated exclusive economic zone and more than 1,000 kilometres (580 miles) from the nearest Chinese landmass. Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam, as well as Taiwan, also have overlapping claims to the sea, believed to contain vast deposits of natural gas and oil.Obama has repeatedly stressed that despite Beijing's territorial disputes with its allies, his Asia rebalancing strategy is not aimed at containing China's rise to regional, and perhaps global super power status. But officials also make clear that they blame China for hiking tensions in the region over claims often well outside its territorial waters. ""We oppose the use of intimidation, coercion or aggression by any state to advance their maritime territorial claims,"" said Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asia at the National Security Council. - US 'rebalance' to Asia -The Philippines has accused China of becoming increasingly aggressive in staking its claims to the sea, and has called on the United States for greater military as well as diplomatic support.During his overnight stay in the Philippines, his first visit as president and his last stop on this Asian journey, Obama will meet President Benigno Aquino, hold a press conference and attend a state dinner. The new defence agreement will not allow Washington to establish a permanent base in the Philippines or bring in nuclear weapons to the country.But it represents a new era in defence ties. The Philippines hosted two of the largest overseas US military bases until 1992, when Manila voted to end their lease amid growing anti-US sentiment. Amid rising regional disquiet over the implications of China's rise, the Philippines has sought greater military ties with Washington in recent years. John Blaxland, a security analyst at the Australian National University said that the new defence deal would be seen as an important US assurance for Manila.""The presence, and the aura of the presence is something that the Philippines desperately wants, and is something that the US sees as being necessary to effect the rebalance to Asia,"" said Blaxland.""Bolstering the US presence will undoubtedly induce the Chinese to think hard about ratcheting further the confrontation with the Philippines in the South China Sea.""
