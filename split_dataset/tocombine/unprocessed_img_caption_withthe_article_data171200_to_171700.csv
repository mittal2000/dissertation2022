2,PARENTING,Sex During The Ninth Month Of Pregnancy Won't Actually Start Labor [STUDY],,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-bringing-on-labor-study_us_5b9c8c3ce4b03a1dcc7faa41,"""We are a little disappointed that we did not find an association,"" said Dr. Tan Peng Chiong, an obstetrics and gynecology",2012-11-22,Cheerful caucasian pregnant woman lying on bed with her husband in the bedroom,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8c3c3c00005b0009cd75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," NEW YORK, Kerry Grens (Reuters Health) - Despite a widespread belief that sex during the later stages of pregnancy can jumpstart labor, a new study from Malaysia found no differences in the timing of delivery between women who had sex near term and those who abstained.""We are a little disappointed that we did not find an association,"" said Dr. Tan Peng Chiong, an obstetrics and gynecology professor at the University of Malaya, and one of the authors of the study. ""It would have been nice for couples to have something safe, effective and perhaps even fun that they could use themselves to help go into labor a little earlier if (they) wanted.""Tan said that many women believe intercourse can induce labor, and scientists have proposed plausible biological explanations for why it might help.For one, semen contains a hormonelike substance called prostaglandin, which is used in synthetic form to induce labor.Breast stimulation is also thought to hasten labor and orgasm can trigger uterine contractions.Tan said the belief also probably came from ""the deep seated folk perception that intercourse in pregnancy may be unsafe and may cause pregnancy expulsion or miscarriage despite fairly replete evidence to the contrary.""But few studies have ever investigated whether sex really can initiate labor, and the small amount of existing evidence was inconclusive, Tan and his colleagues write in the obstetrics and gynecology journal BJOG.So they set out to see whether advising women to have sex during the final weeks of pregnancy could help them avoid an induction.""Labor induction for prolonged pregnancy is common and many women are also tempted for a variety of personal reasons to trigger labor off in the very latter stages of pregnancy,"" he said.The researchers invited more than 1,100 women to participate, all of whom were 35 to 38 weeks pregnant (the typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks) and none of whom had had sex in the previous six weeks.Roughly half of the women were advised by a physician to have sex frequently as a means of safely expediting labor.The other half were told that sex was safe during pregnancy, but that its effects on labor were unknown.The researchers then tracked the women to determine how long their pregnancies lasted and whether they required any medical intervention to start labor.They found that about 85 percent of the women who were encouraged to have sex did follow the doctor's advice, while 80 percent of women in the other group also had sex.Women in the group advised to have sex also had it more frequently for the remaining duration of their pregnancies - three times versus two.But the rates of induced labor were similar in both groups: 22 percent of those advised to have sex and 20.8 percent of the other group had inductions, a difference so small it is likely to have been driven by chance.Pregnancy also lasted an average of 39 weeks for both groups.Dr. Jonathan Schaffir, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at The Ohio State University College of Medicine who has studied obstetrical folklore, said the findings offer good support for the idea that sex won't induce labor.Earlier research had relied primarily on surveys of women about their sexual experiences during pregnancy, but this study was ""the first attempt to really randomize the experience, for some to have sex and some to not, which is a very hard thing to do,"" he said.Schaffir wouldn't advise his patients to have sex for the express purpose of going into labor, he added, but the study did indicate that there aren't any hazards to it.""Even though this study did not show any increase in the rate of labor or a decrease in the rate of induction, it helped to cement the idea that having sex is probably safe if you want it,"" he told Reuters Health.Tan said the results show that pregnancy evolved to be resistant to disruption.""Human pregnancy has to be robust to a little adventure like intercourse and unfortunately for our purpose, it seems pretty robust to the very end,"" he said.SOURCE: bit.ly/WxE4wk BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, online November 12, 2012.Copyright 2012 Thomson Reuters.

Fox in a Delorean. Every Thanksgiving, as soon as I open the canister of spices -- it's as though I'm standing there, watching the scene unfold before me...My mother slid the cornbread dressing into the oven as my younger sister and I chopped vegetables and stirred pots. The turkey was almost done and the smell of roasting meat filled the house with its rich scent. The sounds of football and male conversation drifted in from the den as my Grandaddy, brother, husband and uncle attempted to stay out of the way. My petite and proper, Southern Baptist grandmother, Dot, was dressed in her Sunday finest and chatting with us as we prepared our Thanksgiving feast. Her white hair was permed and perfectly coifed. Her red size five pumps were the exact shade of her lipstick, her knock-off Chanel suit, red clip-on earrings. I took a moment to pause, mentally, and appreciate the beauty of what we were sharing. Three generations of women, gathered around the stove and giving thanks for all the blessings we enjoyed. Cooking recipes that had been tweaked and handed down through my family for generations -- what a gift! I became teary as I realized that my grandparents were getting older and that one day, all too soon -- this crystal clear moment would fade to a hazy memory.The channel changed in the next room and now instead of hearing Sportscenter, we began overhearing news reporters discussing President Bill Clinton's recently discovered indiscretion.""Mmm, it's just shameful,"" Momma said as she stirred the gravy.My sister and I nodded in agreement as my grandmother said in her very Southern drawl, ""I just cain't believe he had oral sex in the Oval Office.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baeb31e2000003000ff5e3e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm not big on crowds, and I hate standing in line. Maybe that's why I find Black Friday so hard to fathom. I mean, I like bargains as much as the next guy. But unlike the 147 million people who the National Retail Federation expects to shop this Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, I'm not especially eager to spend the day sardined at the local hypermart just for a chance to save a buck on a Furby.Is Black Friday really all about bargains? I suppose that's what most shoppers would say -- and what retailers would have us believe. But while I don't doubt that it's possible to save some green on Black Friday, researchers say the retailing riot that defines the day after Thanksgiving may be less about dollars than about basic psychology.At least psychology as it applies to women, apparently. Recent research on Black Friday consumerism has been done mainly on female shoppers, according to a 2011 article in the Washington Post. Women do most holiday gift-buying, Dr. Jane Boyd Thomas, professor of marketing at Winthorp University in Rock Hill, S.C., told the paper, adding that the stereotypes about women and shopping hold true for researchers. ""The only time men were present, they were sort of just tagging along,"" Thomas said.In any case, the research suggests that many Black Friday shoppers actually enjoy being part of the mobs and the quest for bargains, according to The Atlantic Wire. Black Friday discount coupons seem to amp up the pleasure. In fact, a new study sponsored by a coupon company showed that women who receive a discount coupon show reduced stress and higher levels of oxytocin, the so-called ""cuddle hormone.""The enjoyment is only amplified when shoppers feel they're competing with one another for scarce merchandise. ""At certain levels, consumers enjoy arousal and challenges during the shopping process,"" Dr. Sang-Eun Buyn, assistant professor of consumer affairs at Auburn University in Alabama, told the Washington Post. ""They enjoy something that's harder to get, and it makes them feel playful and excited.""Of course, marketing types know just what it takes to fuel this so-called ""hedonic shopping."" They create scarcity -- for example, by deeply discounting specific merchandise but limiting its availability. Like, I dunno, offering a 70-inch plasma television for a nickel -- but only to the person who happens to be first in line when the store opens.Good luck with that.""Research shows that people tend to react against limits on opportunities and reassert their freedom to have and do what they want,"" Dr. Laura Brannon, professor of psychology at Kansas State University, told The Huffington Post in an email. ""We naturally want things that are rare or difficult to obtain... Even in the dating arena, people understand the value of playing 'hard to get.'""Been a while since you dated? Don't worry. Dr. Brannon has another metaphor for the ways in which Black Friday shoppers affect each other's behavior: ""If you have five people stand on a busy street corner and look up in the air, rest assured, most passersby will stop and look up as well because they'll assume there's something to look at.""Once shoppers line up for the coveted merchandise, others feel encouraged to join the queue. Simply put, the line lures rather than repels them. Why is that? Dr. Brannon puts it down to ""social proof"" -- a psychological principle she sums up with the phrase ""if other people are doing something, we use that as evidence that it must be good.""Shoppers who do come away with the coveted merchandise tend to experience a satisfying ""mission accomplished"" feeling. I wouldn't know, of course, but that's one finding of a 2011 study involving interviews with ""experienced female Black Friday shoppers."" The study was co-authored by Dr. Thomas and published in the International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management. In the abstract of the study, Dr. Thomas and her co-author said four themes emerged in the data: familial bonding, strategic planning, and the ""great race,"" along with that ""mission accomplished"" feeling. The authors concluded, ""The themes coalesced around a military metaphor.""Another researcher recently used a different metaphor -- though it, too, is one that conjures up images of firearms and violence.Black Friday is sort of like ""hunting for women,"" said Dr. Leisa Reinecke Flynn, professor of marketing and fashion merchandising at the University of Southern Mississippi. ""It's so much like deer hunting it's hard to tell the two apart.""Black Friday and deer hunting are indistinguishable? Hmm. If there's one thing I have less of a feeling for than shopping for sport, it's what it's like to grab a rifle and blast Bambi. I guess about the only thing I know about deer hunting is that it's a bloody mess.Wait, now I get it."

I have the most precious gift of family and friends. Every dog in our life is also a great gift. And every dog in my pack is a blessing to me.Christmas is also a very special time of year for me. I left my home in Mexico on December 23, 1990 to come to the United States. When I told my mother it was time to go, she just looked at me and said, ""but Cesar it's Christmas time."" I didn't have papers and I only had $100 that my Dad gave me as a going away gift. In hindsight, this money was the greatest gift of all because it allowed me to pay a coyote to help me cross the border. I had tried crossing on my own but failed three times. My Dad's gift was his way of saying ""I believe in you and I believe you can make it."" It was all the money he had!I had a gift too. My gift wasn't a physical thing like a toy or car or money. My gift was a dream of what I wanted to do and a clear belief in my purpose to become the best dog trainer in the world. I eventually made it to Los Angeles, California and found a job washing limos in South Central, but on the streets all around me I saw dogs who had been abused and abandoned by their owners. There was a lot of gang violence at that time in South Central and people were buying large dogs for protection. However, once they got these large dogs, they couldn't control them. I wanted to help. I didn't have much money, but I did have a gift for understanding and training dogs. So, I started rescuing the abandoned dogs one at a time and training them. It didn't take long before I was walking a pack of 60 dogs! Finally, the owner of the limo service that I worked for came to me one day and said, ""you have a real gift for training dogs. I am going to fire you so that you can pursue this gift because otherwise, you will never leave here!"" Wow, I thought to myself, that's the first time a gift caused me to get fired. But he was right. Once I had my pack, I needed to figure out a way to feed them. I believe that sometimes when you have nothing or very little, you have more because you have to trust in faith to make things happen for you. Over the years of hardship, I had developed a gift for making something from nothing. I was able to work out agreements with the shop owners in South Central to keep the dogs in their shops as guard dogs during the night in exchange for money to feed the dogs. This was an amazing thing because it took the dogs off the street and gave them a purpose and the store owners got protection of their shops.Most people see their dogs as ""students"" and the human as the ""teacher."" But to me the dogs are the real teachers. They're totally unselfish and put the welfare of their pack -- both canine and human -- ahead of their own well-being. Dogs can teach us how to be more humane. Dogs can teach us how to live in harmony with family and community. And dogs can definitely teach us about love and service.This holiday season, the first question we should ask ourselves is, ""how can I help?"" It's not ""What's in it for me?"" and it's not about the rewards and recognition we might receive for doing good. We should help because we can. I always look to dogs for inspiration and I realize that dogs are grateful to you, in poverty and in abundance. A dog won't love you if you're rich and he won't love you less if you're poor. The other thing about a dog is that if he could make a wish, it wouldn't be for himself, it would be for his family.Giving the greatest gift of all. My father gave to me and I am giving to my sons Andre and Calvin. Once you start giving, you begin to see the world very differently. You see needs being met, you see families reunited and you see dreams realized.I have travelled to over 10 countries this year. I know first hand how depressed people are about the economy. In Spain, I met with people who have undergone great hardship and sacrifice to fix their economy. Throughout Europe there is great uncertainty about what will happen to the European Union and their currency. In my home country of Mexico there is fear about immigration and jobs. This is the time when we need to raise our eyes beyond our own concerns and say, ""how can I help?""The desire to help others was one of the reasons why I created the Cesar Millan Foundation. This is a nonprofit organization dedicated to animal rescue and rehabilitation and educating humans about animals. The foundation has done many wonderful things to save dogs around the world, as well as, educate over one million elementary school children about humane treatment of animals and the need to adopt abandoned dogs. Since I did not have a college education, I wanted to give the gift of education to some of the poorest schools in America. The school curriculum that I developed in conjunction with Yale University, School of the 21st Century is made available to needy schools for free. My youngest son Calvin is working with a T.V. production company to create a television show around the principles of this curriculum which is called mutt-i-grees. For more information you can go to MillanFoundation.org or visit education.muttigrees.org. When I was growing up poor in Mexico. I didn't get a lot of physical gifts but I did get love and support, and I learned how to create something from nothing. For me, Christmas meant Los Posados, the nine days before Christmas ending on Christmas Eve, when people enjoy the comfort of friends and family. As a father to two boys, I have tried to pass along this learning and tradition along to them... to teach them that physical gifts come and go but the greatest gift of all is giving.

Think hard about what really matters and make someone else's holiday season merry and bright! Without any further intro from a proud Mom... Here's SJ...***While it is accurate that Thanksgiving only comes once a year, I think Thanksgiving is more of an attitude that we should live by than a holiday. Thanksgiving promotes an attitude of gratitude; I apologize on the front end for the rhyme, merely a coincidence. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""For every minute you are angry, you lose 60 seconds of happiness."" If you have the freedom to read this little article, you have much to be thankful for.In 1863, Abraham Lincoln declared that the last Thursday of every November be celebrated with a national holiday known as ""Thanksgiving Day"" to honor those colonists and Wampanoag Indians who sat down and shared a feast one Autumn day in 1621. William Bradford, the ""governor"" of Plymouth and the first colonists who arrived on the Mayflower in 1620 arranged this meal. The point of my telling you this is not to bore you with history. My point is that the original settlers sat down and were thankful for a meal even though about half of the original 102 colonists who traveled over on the Mayflower perished during the first winter.Abraham Lincoln created the holiday in the middle of the Civil War. He had time to be thankful even though he was the leader of our nation during the biggest turmoil our country has ever had to go through. I'd be curious to see what Lincoln would think of the country he once led today. He might think it humorous how our perceptions of words like Thanksgiving, blessing, giving, etc. have changed.Recently, our nation had the privilege of voting for our president. Instead of being thankful for the fact that we were able to watch two men debate on our television or read about it on our computers, our tablets, or in newspapers, we complain that the candidate we wanted or didn't want to win did not. I bet people in China and North Korea sure would have enjoyed their voices being heard.If you are reading this on an electronic device, it is estimated that less than 1 percent of the world owns a computer. How is that for something that we overlook? About 151,600 people die every day, which equates to about 2 people per second; Life is a gift. I had a friend open the fridge the other day and jokingly mumbled how there was nothing good to eat. I thought about this for a second and wondered how many people open their refrigerators and have nothing. Take that a step further; think how many people are not afforded the luxury of even owning a refrigerator. I know this message is very cliché and pounded in our heads from such a young age, but we truly do have so much that we are blessed with.So as my dad says,""What is the rub?"" The rub is that the holiday is not ""Thanks-getting."" This day was not designed just for us to sit around a table and be thankful for blessings. As aforementioned, Thanksgiving is an attitude. The cheesy definition of ""gratitude"" is: ""The quality of being thankful; readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness."" So as you sit around a table, thankful for blessings remember the key word in the definition is: show.It is not what we say about our blessings, but how we use them. Sure, it may be easy for me to say; my parents are still together and as of now are not included in the 8 percent of American population who are not holding jobs. So yes, it is easy to sit around a table with friends, family or send a tweet out or however you will be communicating on this holiday about counting our blessings, but counting only gets you so far. Living thankfully, showing, not telling, is a true measure of our Thanksgiving."

""They pay low wages, then the taxpayers pick up the tab for food stamps and Medicaid,"" Ferreira said. ""They need to take care of their people. They need to be responsible to their workers."" A few months ago, Ferreira heard about the union-backed group OUR Walmart, which is orchestrating an as-yet-unknown number of strikes at Walmart stores throughout the country this week, throwing the world's largest retailer into damage control just ahead of Black Friday. Ferreira said she liked the idea of a group advocating for workers, so she joined.Ferreira said she tried to recruit members, but it wasn't easy. ""They're so scared,"" Ferreira said of her co-workers. ""I couldn't get anybody to join. They said, 'You can't fight Walmart.'""Whatever strikes hit Walmart stores this Friday, it's likely only a small, perhaps miniscule fraction of the retailer's 1.4-million member U.S. workforce will take part. And though news footage may show boisterous gatherings by activists outside stores, the more daring acts of protest will have been undertaken by individual workers like Ferreira who walk out when there are no TV cameras around. In recent days, it became clear that if she went on strike she would probably do so alone. But Ferreira said she felt compelled to walk out after an incident a few days ago. In a letter she's filing with the National Labor Relations Board, Ferreira accuses management of retaliating against her because of legally protected organizing in the workplace. Ferreira said that on Saturday she received her first-ever ""coaching"" -- a formal bit of Walmart disciplining that could help lead to dismissal down the road -- after a customer complained about a problem with a cake order. Despite occasional problems with cakes in the past, Ferreira said it was the only coaching she's been given in eight years. She said she believes she was disciplined because she was a known member of OUR Walmart who might demonstrate on Black Friday. She said in her letter that she would withdraw her complaint if the coaching were removed from her file.""I've worked at Walmart and never had a writeup, no warning, no nothing,"" Ferreira said. ""I've been in the baking industry in retail operations for 20 years and never [been] disciplined.""On Wednesday morning, Ferreira said she and other employees were called to a meeting where the manager warned there might be distractions led by OUR Walmart surrounding the holiday. According to her own version, Ferreira told her co-workers it was employees' right to go on strike, and then things got ""pretty hot."" A few workers said Ferreira didn't speak for them. Ferreira said she was speaking for the ones who were afraid to say anything at all. To cool everybody off, Ferreira said the manager tried to lead everybody in a ""Walmart cheer.""  ""Why don't you just quit?"" Ferreira said one co-worker told her.""I said I've got eight years invested in this place -- I'm going to make it better,"" Ferreira said.The store manager did not return a call from HuffPost requesting the manager's version of events.After the meeting, Ferreira said her manager came to the bakery with store security and asked her if she planned on disrupting the store on Black Friday or Thanksgiving. The manager offered an ""open-door"" discussion to talk about her grievances, which Ferreira declined. Ferreira gave her a letter informing her of her charge being filed with the labor board and then clocked out.By then, several family members had shown up to support Ferreira, including her daughter, Tanya Russ, who said the scene was ""awkward and tense.""""Everybody was looking, but nobody was saying anything,"" Russ said. ""The other workers, they were looking but everybody got really quiet. Then I just said, 'Walk out.' So we walked out.""Russ noted that her mother is in a better position than many workers, since her husband has a good job and they're less dependent on her wages.""She didn't have to do this,"" Russ said. ""She's not in a position [many] workers are where they live off the government and don't have a car and don't know how the bills will get paid. She's standing up for them and for her future co-workers."" Russ and the other family members had brought homemade protest signs. They included the classic Walmart smiley face with tape over the mouth, to symbolize the silencing of workers. Their signs said ""We want to live better, too."" Ferreira and her family were joined by labor activists but no other employees. The police soon arrived, took down their information and ordered them to leave because they were trespassing (the police order comes at the end of the video below). According to Sgt. Denise Roberts of the St. Cloud Police Department, the police issued the trespassing warnings at Walmart's request. They were not given summonses because no civil or criminal charges will be filed. In all, more than 20 such warnings were given to people outside.""We did it on behalf of Walmart,"" Roberts said. ""Walmart just has a policy with this Black Friday that they don't want anybody doing any demonstrations inside the store or outside.""Angela Williamson, a former Walmart employee and activist with the United Food and Commercial Workers union, was also given a trespassing warning. She said she and the others, including Ferreira, were told they could not come back on Walmart property.Kory Lundberg, a Walmart spokesman, said the trespassing warning was given to Ferreira mistakenly, and that she's welcome to return to the store for her next shift after her strike. ""It was certainly not intended, and we're reaching back out to her,"" Lundberg said. Lundberg said Walmart did not have enough information to comment on Ferreira's retaliation claims.Of the strikes expected Friday, Lundberg said, ""We think it's going to be the same small number of associates at the same handful of stores they've targeted over and over, most of it union organized. ... It's not going to have an impact on our stores."" Ferreira has both Thanksgiving and Black Friday off, with her next shift set for Saturday. She'll be spending the holiday at her daughter's house with her family. She said she has much to be thankful for.""I'm blessed compared to other workers at Walmart,"" she said.CORRECTION: This article has been revised to correct the spelling of Ferreira's last name.

The Twinkie, an American icon and one of the nation's all-time favorite snack cakes, is celebrating its 75th anniversary this month. James A. Dewar created the beloved treat in 1930, while working as a Hostess bakery manager in Chicago. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2ddc32000003000000eb7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Carey Gillam and Martinne GellerKANSAS CITY, Mo./NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Enough is enough, say bakery workers at Hostess Brands Inc.After several years of costly concessions, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco and Grain Millers Union (BCTGM) authorized a walk-out earlier this month after Hostess received bankruptcy court approval to implement a wage cut that was not included in its contract.With operations stalled, the company that makes Twinkies and other famous U.S. brands said last week that liquidating its business was the best way to preserve its dwindling cash. It won court approval on Wednesday to start winding down in a process expected to claim 15,000 jobs immediately and over 3,000 more after about four months. [ID: n L1E8ML3WU]Interviews with more than a dozen workers showed there was little sign of regret from employees who voted for the strike. They said they would rather lose their jobs than put up with lower wages and poorer benefits.""They're just taking from us,"" said Kenneth Johnson, 46, of Missouri. He said he earned roughly $35,000 with overtime last year, down from about $45,000 five years ago.""I really can't afford to not be working, but this is not worth it. I'd rather go work somewhere else or draw unemployment,"" said Johnson, a worker at Hostess for 23 years.With 18,500 workers, Hostess has 12 different unions including the B CTGM, which has about 5,600 members on the bread and snack item production lines, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents about 7,500 route sales representatives, drivers and other employees.Unlike some non-unionized rivals, the maker of Wonder Bread and Drake's cakes had to navigate more than 300 labor c ontracts, with terms that often strained efficiency and competitiveness, Hostess officials have said. In some extreme cases, contract provisions required different products to be delivered on different trucks even when headed to the same place.Aside from those so-called onerous labor contracts, Hostess has grappled for some time with rising ingredient costs and a growing health consciousness that has made its sugary cakes less popular. It filed for bankruptcy in January, only three years after emerging from a prior bankruptcy.Lance Ignon, speaking on behalf of Hostess, said the company recognized how difficult the past few years had been for workers and wished it did not have to ask them for more givebacks.""But the reality was that the company could not survive without those concessions,"" Ignon said.FRUSTRATIONS, COMPLAINTSWorkers had a laundry list of frustrations, from rising healthcare costs to decreased wages and delayed pension benefits. They even cited a $10-per-week per worker charge they said Hostess claimed was needed to boost company capital.""They have taken and taken and taken from us,"" said Debi White, who has worked at Hostess for 26 years, most recently as a bun handler at its bread and roll plant in Lenexa, Kansas.""They have been walking around stomping their foot saying either you give in ... or else we're going to close you now. Well, go ahead, we're tired of their threats,"" she said. ""That's how we feel.""Hostess workers are now scrambling to figure out when their health insurance runs out -- or if it already has -- and where and how to apply for job retraining and unemployment benefits.Following a summer and autumn spent in labor negotiations trying to find a common path to reorganization, Hostess' management gained concessions from some unions, including the Teamsters.The fear of thousands of job losses, for its own members and other unions, led the Teamsters to plead with the BCTGM t o hold a secret ballot to determine if bakery workers really wanted to continue with the strike, even with the threat of closure.Teamsters officials complained that bakery union leaders did ""not substantively look for a solution or engage in the process,"" and complained that the BCTGM c a lled for its strike on Nov. 9 without first notifying the Teamsters.They said that, unlike the bakery union, the Teamsters voted to ""protect all jobs at Hostess."" Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Ken Hall said Wednesday's court approval for liquidation marked ""a sad day for thousands of families affected by the closing of this company.""Bakery union President Frank Hurt has said that any labor agreements would only be temporary as Hostess was doomed anyway. The union said new owners were needed to get Hostess back on track and the only way they would return to work was if Hostess rescinded its wage and benefit cuts.""Our membership ... just had no confidence in this management group being able to run a business,"" said Conrad Boos, a BCTGM local business representative in Missouri.Hurt was not immediately available to comment on Wednesday but the union said in a court filing its sole objective was to leave Hostess with ""a real, rather than an illusory or theoretical, likelihood of establishing a stable business with secure jobs."" On Wednesday, Hostess' lawyer Heather Lennox said the company had received a ""flood of inquiries"" from potential buyers for several brands that could be sold at auction, and expects initial bidders within a few weeks."

10,WELLNESS,A Movement to Fight HPV Throat Cancer,"Pamela Tom, Contributor

Public education will hopefully change that.",2012-11-21,Doctor hand make patient insulin flu shot by syringe subcutaneous arm injection vaccination isolated on a white background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c828f1f00002d00213f56.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A movement starts with one voice. In this case, it's mine -- but everyone's concern.Doctors say HPV-associated throat cancer is becoming a pandemic among non-smoking, middle-aged men. A 2011 study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology says by 2020, the number of cases of men with HPV throat cancer will surpass women with HPV cervical cancer.Haven't heard about it? I didn't know anything about it until last March when my husband, Jeff, was diagnosed with the HPV-16 strain, the human papillomavirus that causes oropharyngeal cancer in the throat, tongue, or tonsils. A week after he was diagnosed with HPV-associated throat cancer, we were preparing for treatment: simultaneous radiation and chemotherapy for seven weeks. Jeff was snapped under a netted mask onto the radiation table every day for two months. He visited the chemo infusion clinic once a week for two hours. He relied on a feeding tube and liquid diet. He lost 45 pounds and it changed his life.My emotions ran the gamut but mostly I felt helpless. Until I decided I could help. As Jeff underwent treatment, I spent the months working my day job at home so I could care for him. When he slept, I educated myself about HPV throat cancer. What is it? How could he get throat cancer when he has never smoked? What I learned is what YOU need to know.Anyone can get HPV through vaginal, anal, and oral sex -- in fact, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), at least half of the sexually active population will have HPV at some in their lives. As many as 50 to 80 percent of middle-aged men may carry HPV. For undetermined reasons, maybe cultural, Caucasian men are most susceptible to HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer at this time. HPV is usually contracted in the early 20s, when people become sexually active. HPV sits dormant in the body for decades... then emerges. That's why middle-aged men who got it when they were young are now fighting HPV throat cancer. Only certain strains of HPV cause cancer. The HPV-16 strain causes throat cancer. The Pap smear screens for HPV in women but there is no formal screening for HPV in men. There has been some media coverage about HPV throat cancer, yet not on a wide scale given this is a national -- if not global -- pandemic. That's why I am building an informational multimedia website called hpvandme.org that will be a user-friendly, first-stop resource with information about prevention, treatment, research news, and support. Creating awareness about HPV throat cancer is my way of helping while feeling so helpless.My goal is to start a movement. One voice that grows into a collective voice because HPV-associated throat cancer is spreading, and more and more men will have to fight it. Early detection is important because once the cancer is no longer localized in the throat and spreads, surgery may no longer be an option. In such cases, like my husband's, evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes prompted his oncologist to order the harsher radiation and/or chemo treatment.Scientists have been studying HPV throat cancer for less than 10 years. They need support to find better treatments and ultimately, a cure. Researchers are still determining the best treatment plans for HPV throat cancer. They know HPV throat cancer is different than throat cancer caused by tobacco and alcohol. In the meantime, because the outbreak is more recent and treatment for HPV throat cancer is less proven, often the more aggressive treatment used for a smoker's cancer is prescribed. Our doctor told us while it may be overkill, it's better to over-treat, rather than under-treat the cancer. Doctors say the prognosis for HPV throat cancer patients is good -- if detected early. If we start learning and spreading the word about HPV prevention and cancer now, we can reduce the risk.I have learned of other HPV throat cancer patients. After treatment, they can no longer produce saliva, taste foods as before... One man lost his jaw, tongue, and ability to speak. And women can get HPV throat cancer, too. We still don't know if Jeff is cancer-free, but he is living ""life to the fullest."" Strong, active men like Jeff won't think to seek medical help when they feel a lump in their throat or have difficulty swallowing. Public education will hopefully change that. Young men and parents of boys should also know that the CDC recommends HPV vaccines for boys as well as girls. While there has been controversy about the Gardasil HPV vaccine, it is considered an effective way to fight back. I am not a doctor. I am a journalist spreading the word. One voice = many voices = CHANGE.For more information, watch this report.Please help me spread the word. The site will launch in 2013.  In the meantime, please share this link about this project with everyone you know. For more by Pamela Tom, click here.For more on personal health, click here."

If you're newly divorced, you're probably thankful to be free and moving on. However, the holidays can still be a difficult time for anybody who has been recently divorced. In fact, Thanksgiving kicks off the string of holidays that I like to refer to as ""the big four"" -- Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years and Valentine's Day. If you have been married for many years, it's probably difficult to spend these first holidays without a significant other. If you have children, it's undoubtedly a big change for them as well. However, the bright side is that you have survived divorce, so take a moment to commend yourself for getting through it. As Thanksgiving approaches, you should be thankful for the many reasons that you are divorced and finally on the road to happiness. In fact, this is your chance to enjoy the holiday in a whole new way. Below are some things that divorcés may be thankful for during Thanksgiving.   Your Own Invite List: Now that you're divorced, the great thing about holidays like Thanksgiving is that the guest list is all up to you. You can invite whomever you want. And if you weren't fond of your ex-spouse's relatives, you won't have to see them this holiday or any other. Only the Turkey Will Be Stuffed: At the end of your marriage, you probably thought your ex was full of it. You may have even resented spending the last few holidays with him or her. Thankfully, this year, the only one filled with stuffing at the dinner table will be the turkey. A Slice of Life: During your marriage, you may have let your spouse cut the turkey on Thanksgiving. It's now your turn to do the ceremonial slicing. The divorce might have cut deep, but you're now free to enjoy life again and cutting the turkey is just another sign of your freedom.   Sleepy Time: You probably had to listen to your ex tell everyone the same stories at the dinner table. They probably made you sleepier than the tryptophan in the turkey. Now that you're divorced, you don't have to listen to any more boring stories from your ex. A New Head of the Table: Over the years, your spouse sat at the head of the table. Now it's your chance. By taking this seat and not looking back, you're redefining the new family structure in your home. No Need to Share: Maybe one of the best reasons is that all of the leftovers in the fridge are now yours to do whatever you want with. That delicious pecan pie your ex always seemed to polish off without you getting a slice is your new guilty pleasure. There's no need to share leftovers with your ex any longer.   Not Your Party: When you were married, you may have had to go to a friend or relative's house that your ex wanted to. Even though you didn't like him or her, you put on a happy face. No more going to places you don't want to on the holidays -- now it's all up to you.For more tips on how to survive the holidays after a divorce, read Lois Tarter's new book ""The Divorce Ritual"" by clicking here."
12,DIVORCE,A Public Service Announcement For Remorseless Cheaters,"Tracy Schorn, Contributor
Blogger and cartoonist at Chump Lady",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-public-service-announce_us_5b9c865fe4b03a1dcc7f7112,Dear remorseless cheaters: Apparently there is still some confusion out there that your extracurricular shenanigans are wrong.,2012-11-21,A silhouette shot of a business colleagues having an affair in the office,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c865f1f000050002140f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Remorseless Cheaters,Apparently there is still some confusion out there that your extracurricular shenanigans are wrong. In the interest of members of the unsuspecting public that may hook up, marry, or have children with you, the following PSA is offered.1. You aren't ""edgy."" You think we lack the sophistication and intellect to understand your complicated love rhombus. On the contrary. You lack the intellect to keep both your security clearance and your pants on. Cheating on your spouse doesn't make you special, misunderstood, or star crossed. It makes you rather embarrassing.2. Quit with your Darwinian theories already. We didn't evolve to be monogamous? Well, we didn't evolve to do a lot of things. Farm. Use indoor plumbing. Buy sequined crap on QVC. And yet we manage. Why is it that you blame your primal self for infidelity, yet you are quite adept at technologies such as placing personal ads on Craigslist? Why point to the reptilian part of your brain as an excuse for boinking whomever you want to? When the spouse of that person comes after you with a shotgun, neither you nor the court of law will be much impressed with his argument that the reptilian part of his brain would like to splatter your guts on the sidewalk.3. Admit that you like the deceit. Come on, it's a high. Playing hooky is a lot more fun than getting a day off from school. Everyone there in the classroom, playing by the rules, listening to a boring lecture on the Continental Congress, while you smoke dope behind the bleachers. Renegade! The secrecy and lies are what gives the frisson of danger to your affair and makes it so delicious. Otherwise you would have an open marriage, same rules for everyone. But no, the power imbalance is what you're after. You enjoy a position of advantage over your trusting partner. They're at home, devoting their energies to you and your home life, faithful to the wonderfulness that is you. Sweet gig you got there -- and you know it.4. Stop minimizing. Cheating is no big deal? Quit getting those puritanical knickers in a twist? It's just a quick naughty with the boots on. Nothing to get so huffy about. Geez.Tell that to the man who had to paternity test his children. Or to the spouse who gets an STD thanks to you. Or to the stay-at-home mother who made herself financially vulnerable to your cheating ass. Or to the children who lost their intact family and get shuttled around next holiday season, having to play nice with your latest flame.When your family reminds you of your selfish choices that led to these outcomes, you'll be tempted to tell them that they are bitter and should stop playing at ""victimhood."" They are not pretending to be victims -- they are victims. How they navigate away from that pain is up to them. You've got no business telling them to suck it up. When the urge strikes, distract yourself, perhaps with a sparkly object like a mirror, an exercise class, or by slapping yourself.5. Swingers, open marriage aficionados, the polyamorous -- no one is judging you. Have at it. It's not cheating if everyone is consenting and on board. This public service announcement does not apply to you.6. No one is forcing you to stay married. If you don't want to be monogamous, don't be. Find another person like yourself and quit feigning monogamy. If your marriage is truly awful and sexless and your love language is seething passive aggression, find your guts and just end it honestly. But your spouse and children couldn't function without you? They need you too much? Let them be the judge of that. You may find that they get on quite well without you. Your partner is a person deserving of respect and honesty, not a consolation prize. It's condescending to act like life with them is a huge sacrifice. Lay your ""burden"" down already.7. This is not your best self. It is understandable that you want to think of yourself as a good person. Our character, however, is made up of our actions. Not how we wish to perceive ourselves. People who don't care who they are hurting, who lack empathy synapses and introspection? We call those people sociopaths. Don't be like that. (And if you are truly like that, no public service announcement in the world can save you.) You're better than this. Please go live an authentic life.Thank you."
