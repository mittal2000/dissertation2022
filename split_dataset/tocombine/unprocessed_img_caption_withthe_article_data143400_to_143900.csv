One of the farmers, whose specialty was Asian vegetables, had a huge crate of these gorgeous little green peppers -- they looked most tempting! Since then, I've been such an avid fan of the exotic peppers that I've even grown them in my own garden.Shishito peppers are small Japanese sweet peppers; they're skinny and slightly twisted. They're picked young, while still green and only about three inches long. When growing my own I've never had a spicy one in the bunch, but when I've purchased them, about one in 10 peppers turns out to be hot. Also, I find that the smaller the peppers are, the less of a chance they'll be spicy. Of course, the most wonderful thing about these little peppers is their flavor -- slightly smoky and sweet with a hint of bitterness.They are delightful simply pan-sautéed with a little olive oil, served as a nibble or a side veggie. But here, I serve them with feta, olives and fresh thyme for a delectable hors d'oeuvre.If you can't find shishito peppers at your farmers' market, look for them in Asian specialty stores - especially Korean markets, where you'll find them labeled as ""twist peppers.""Marinated Feta with Pan-Roasted Shishito Peppers and OlivesServes 4 Active time: 20 min4 oz (115 g) Shishito peppers or mini sweet peppers - left whole 2 tablespoons olive oil sea salt to taste 8 oz (225 g) feta - cut in 1"" cubes (1 1/2 cups) 1 cup Kalamata olives 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oilStep 1: Before cooking the peppers, make a small slit in each pepper with a paring knife. This will prevent them from bursting when they cook. Heat a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the oil and peppers and toss well. Sauté for 4 to 5 minutes until peppers are golden-brown and blistered, tossing only occasionally. Transfer to a tray lined with paper towels and sprinkle with the salt. Set aside.Step 2: Place the feta, olives and roasted peppers in a wide bowl. Sprinkle with the thyme. Drizzle with the olive oil and gently turn the ingredients over with a silicone spatula, being careful not to break the feta cubes. Let marinate at room temperature, for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour before serving."

It has currency, postage stamps, a national anthem (""E Mare Libertas,"" which is also its national motto, meaning ""from the sea, freedom""), and even a soccer team. Never heard of Sealand? That's not a surprise. It's a concrete dot in the North Sea roughly the size of two tennis courts, and it's never been recognized by any other nation on Earth. But that never bothered its eccentric founder, Paddy Roy Bates.In 1967, Bates was a pirate radio broadcaster looking to operate a radio station untroubled by the then-strict regulation of the British airwaves. To that end, he occupied HM Fort Roughs, a Royal Navy fortification that had been built seven miles off the coast of Suffolk during World War II as a platform for anti-aircraft artillery. When maintenance workers approached the fort in 1968, the Bates family opened fire with a shotgun, beginning a fine tradition of Sealanders taking pot-shots at passersby.Also from Condé Nast Traveler: Submit Your Travel Photos to Win a $25K VacationA court found that because the fort lay outside Britain's three-mile limit of territorial waters, Her Majesty's government had no jurisdiction over the incident. This decision inspired Bates to declare his ""nation"" 's independence, rechristening Fort Roughs as the Principality of Sealand and crowning himself its first head of state, Prince Roy I.The new nation faced its toughest international challenge in 1978, when a German lawyer named Alexander Achenbach stormed the marine platform, took Bates's son Michael hostage, and declared himself Prime Minster of Sealand. The coup failed when Prince Roy led a daring helicopter raid to retake his country, but Achenbach's group still considers itself the rightful leaders of Sealand, and runs a ""government-in-exile"" from Germany.Sealand's original government is also an absentee one nowadays. Prince Roy died last October, leaving the throne to his son Michael. But Prince Michael lives on the mainland, in Essex, so the Principality of Sealand currently has a population of one: a caretaker who lives on the platform. The nation's main source of income continues to be the online sales of mugs, t-shirts, and even peerages -- you and that special someone can become Count and Countess of Sealand for just $320! But in 2012, Sealand announced it was beginning a new tourism industry, for visitors dying to see one of the world's weirdest micronations. Be warned, however: To come ashore at Sealand, you'll have to be lifted out of your boat on a winch. After a long history of invasions, the fortress has no ladders.More from Condé Nast Traveler: Is This the Best Job of All Time?

It is more than likely that I had spent too many hours watching Hitchcock movies when I first got it in my head that I must evoke the hair stylings of Grace Kelly on my big day. After a few months of growing my hair out from the pixie cut that I had loved for the better part of a decade, I tried to convince myself that the next inch is when my hair will suddenly feel full, wavy, and elegant. Three months before the wedding, and a week before my bridal shower, I started to panic. My hair did not look glamorous, in fact, it looked weighed down and flat (the way my hair had always looked whenever I attempted to grow it more than a few inches past my jawline). In my state of panic, I decided that the cure for my long hair blues had to be a bottle of platinum blond hair dye. You can probably imagine what happened next: My flat hair had become fried and, instead of Grace Kelly, I looked more like I belonged in an '80s hair band.I looked awful, and yet, I thought I can make this work, I attended my shower with my long, bleached blonde hair and continued to pin my favorite updos onto Pinterest.The whole wedding was nontraditional -- we were getting married in a movie theatre, there would be a marching band, and my husband and I would surprise our guests with a rap performance. It was all so unique, and yet, I was still trying to convince myself that I wanted traditional bridal hair on my wedding day. The problem was, I was not buying it anymore, and after a brief discussion with my Maid of Honor it was decided that I had to be myself.I booked an appointment with a salon, one that did not judge me for wanting to be a short hair bride, and chopped off seven inches of hair a mere three weeks before the wedding. There was no turning back.I have to admit that I was a slightly concerned at first: What if I had made a huge mistake? Well, you know what? The morning of the wedding I felt special, beautiful, and all of the things that a bride should feel. I got married to an amazing person who loves me and, most importantly, I felt like myself while doing it.The moral of this story is not to encourage droves of newly engaged women to chop off their hair, but to say that your wedding day should be about celebrating who you truly are. If you are a short haired girl, own it! If you have a head full of awesome curls, own it! If you have tattoos up and down your arms, own it! Whatever you do, stay true to yourself, and you will be a beautiful bride."

Smokeless tobacco can cause oral and other cancers, as well as other mouth diseases and heart disease.Among several striking findings in the ITCP report was that, while many smokers and tobacco users said they knew of the health risks, only a small proportion said they would like to quit.Up to 94 percent of smokers and up to the same proportion of smokeless users in the survey said they had no plans to give up.Set against this, the report also found that up to 81 percent of smokers and up to 87 percent of smokeless tobacco users expressed regret for taking up the habit, and more than 90 percent of tobacco users and non-users in all four states had negative views on smoking and tobacco.The report said that, while India has been a regional leader in enacting tobacco control legislation over the past 10 years, the laws are poorly enforced, regulations covering smoke-free zones are patchy, and tobacco remains relatively cheap.Fong said the low percentage of people wanting to quit meant deaths from tobacco use were destined to stay high.""If there is any single indicator of the urgent need for continued and strengthened efforts for strong, evidence-based tobacco control in India - this is it.""
