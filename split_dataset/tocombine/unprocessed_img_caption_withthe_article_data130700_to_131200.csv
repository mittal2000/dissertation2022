""China urges the United States again to carefully handle the current ... investigations, be prudent in taking measures and terminate the investigation proceedings.""China will assess the impact on its solar industry and ""resolutely defend"" itself through various mechanisms, the ministry said.The investigations were sparked by a complaint at the end of last year by the U.S. unit of German solar manufacturer SolarWorld AG . The company at the time said it was seeking to close a loophole in a prior trade case that enabled Chinese solar panel producers to evade duties by using cells manufactured in other countries, mainly Taiwan.The Commerce Department investigation and a parallel inquiry by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) could open the door to expanding duties on some imported solar panels.In October 2012, the U.S. set steep duties on billions of dollars of solar products from China, but turned down pleas to expand the scope of its order to include Chinese panels made with non-Chinese solar cells. In response, many Chinese module producers simply began sourcing cells from Taiwan.The ITC is to make a preliminary ruling on whether there is a reasonable indication that imports from China or Taiwan materially injure, or threaten to injure, the local industry by Feb. 14. A negative finding would stop the investigations.If the ITC determines that the imports could be hurting the domestic industry, the Commerce department is to make preliminary determinations about subsidies in March and dumping in June.

Yet savings know no season, and are sometimes affected by a timeline of when energy investments will have paid for themselves. Unfortunately most products don't come with this information clearly stamped on the box, but that's where we come in! Here we examine seven popular product categories to see how long it might take before you realize any returns on investments.Payback time is an important factor in determining your energy savings, but it should not be the sole factor in determining which appliance to buy, or home improvement investment to make. Sometimes, we spend money just to upgrade our quality of life, and certainly, a brand new refrigerator or windows will accomplish that. But these decisions also produce measurable savings that take the edge off the final bill, even as they contribute to a better environment and real energy efficiency. And if you're on the fence about spending for your home, payback time is arguably the one variable that can act as a tiebreaker. Knowing you'll see a real return in real time can provide, yes, real comfort in more ways than one."
2,BLACK VOICES,HBCU Presidents Share Insight On Sustainable Leadership,Jarrett L.

But with a new year of challenges ahead in financing, political mobilization and the redefining of value in higher education, many HBCU communities are searching to discover how to keep quality leadership, or to attract it. Four sitting presidents shared lessons on sustainable HBCU leadership, with each giving their top impression of what it takes to build a long and successful presidency at a black college. “It really starts with president and board synergy. If they are not compatible, the institution suffers. Most of these short tenures are due to that mismatch, and that’s not an indictment of the president or the board. It starts though with the presidential candidate.” - Dillard University President Walter Kimbrough“Leading HBCUs has to be a labor of love for the institutions and students that we serve. In addition to the normal stresses of running universities in an era of shrinking resources, there are special challenges embedded in HBCUs. They are institutional reflections of the people they primarily serve, and as such have been denied access to wealth and the ability to generate it.” - Southern University System President Ronald Mason“In the first four years, we were on the road more than three days a week to get corporations and donors to understand and appreciate what we were trying to build in our academic and social training systems here. We wanted students to learn and follow the values of honesty, integrity, respect, and accountability. We wanted them to be servants to their fellow man. And our partners bought into those ideas.” - Hampton University President William Harvey“In my almost seven years at the helm of the Quinnite Nation I have come to two central conclusions concerning personnel management. The first is that we must be obsessive about recruiting, retaining, and developing premium talent for our staffs and faculties. Just as a coach cannot consistently win games without gifted players, college presidents cannot produce outstanding students and institutions with mediocre staff/faculty. It does not add up.” - Paul Quinn College President Michael Sorrell "

The Dobsonian telescope, a type of Newtonian telescope on a cannon mount, helped to revolutionize amateur astronomy, making it possible for large-aperture telescopes to be home-made with readily-available materials. (Photo by Garth Eliassen/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baebdd52200003401db0c16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Eccentric telescope pioneer and world-renowned astronomer John Dobson passed away this month at the age of 98. He revolutionized astronomy with a homemade telescope design now belovedly known as the Dobsonian Telescope and made the sky more accessible to the backyard star gazer. He founded Sidewalk Astronomers and brought telescopes to a street corner near you. His motto: ""Have telescope. Will travel.""The Dobsonian TelescopeDobson spent most of his life in the San Francisco area. After graduating from UC Berkeley with a chemistry degree, he dabbled in many fields, including modern dance. As a member of the Carol Beals dance group, Dobson participated in politically motivated dramatizations. In 1934 he performed for the Waterfront strike that began after two workers were killed on the job. ""I was all muscles back then,"" he said. ""I had this long hair, and, well, you might understand that I would look a little funny to the dock workers."" Dobson spent the next 23 years of his life as a monk in San Francisco's Vedanta Monastery, where he had his astronomical awakening. In his free time he made his own telescopes out of scrap parts and donated materials. As a monk he was allowed no personal possessions and had to hide his activities. He ground his mirrors for hours in a tub of water so that the scraping sound would not alert the other monks.At night he would sneak out to the streets of San Francisco to try his telescopes. He quickly became hooked on these nocturnal pursuits, where he shared views of the heavens with an enthusiastic public. When the other monks found out, they threw him out of the monastery and threw his telescope into San Francisco Bay. They never believed his astronomical excuse and reasoned that he must be doing sinful things under the cover of darkness. His dismissal from the monastery allowed Dobson to dive into astronomy full-time. In 1968 Dobson and some of his protégés founded a public service organization called the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers. When asked what it was like being in San Francisco in the late '60s, Dobson deadpanned, ""Well, sure, it was foggy....""'Have Telescope. Will Travel.'Dobson and his telescope made a strange sight on a street corner. He was an old, rail-thin man with a pony tail imploring passersby to peer through an object that looks more like a cannon than a telescope. In the 1970s his group expanded to other cities, and they often went on the road. Their 24-inch telescope made the rounds in national parks, Native American reservations, and anyplace where ""dark skies and the public collide.""For the next 30 years Dobson globetrotted from starparty to starparty. He had no permanent residence but hopped around a worldwide network of fans and well wishers. Donna Smith had the challenging task of managing his tours. On visits he preferred staying in astronomers' homes and often refused payment. ""He's ripped up checks before,"" Smith said. ""Or he just lost them."" She warned me, ""Also, if you see him pick up a weed on the ground and eat it, don't be alarmed. He knows what it is.""When I interviewed Dobson in 2005, he told me that the greatest thing about telescopes is that ""they let you see where the hell you were born."" He apologized for the mild curse. ""I hope it doesn't offend. But one time I said that to a lady. She asked, 'Why should I look through a telescope?' and I said, 'So you can see where the hell you got born.' She walked away and called a cop over. This was in Texas."" The policeman told Dobson to pack up his telescope and go somewhere else.When people looked through his telescope for the first time, at the Moon or Jupiter or Saturn, he heard this: ""Wow.""""One kid looked at the Moon, and he turns to me and says, 'Nice, but it needs some repairs.'"" When an adult asked him how far it is to Jupiter, he typically responded, ""Way the hell out there.""So it was not surprising when someone asked, ""What are you? An astronomer or a comedian?""He often rankled professional astronomers by criticizing their theories. ""Professionals are straying from the formulas,"" he said. ""They're not using them. They're using their guts. And I always say, 'Don't trust your guts. They're full of....'""To the end John Dobson was an amateur astronomer and relished the title. ""It is up to the amateurs to bring astronomy to the people, to get individuals really interested in astronomy,"" he said. ""They are generally the best people.""Dobson One-LinersBelow are some excerpts from our often rapid-fire Q-and-A session that highlighted this memorable astronomical personality. We'll miss you, John.Dean Regas: How did you get into astronomy?John Dobson: I was born. D: How do you describe being a sidewalk astronomer?J: I am an astronomical entertainer to her majesty the general public.D: When you were in the monastery, one of your missions was to reconcile science and religion.

I eat the yogurt and power the telescope. But if I get hungry, I'll just forage around in your back yard for a while.D: Is astronomy like a religion? J: If it is, an observatory is like a temple. I often thought of it that way. An observatory definitely is a temple. But religion is completely different. Religion is based solely on feelings. It's all guesswork.

""We are taking aggressive action to determine the nature and scope of the issue.""The warning comes in the wake of a massive data breach at Target Corp  over the holiday shopping season, and suggests that hackers may be attacking U.S. retailers in a spree the extent of which is yet to be fully understood.Target last month said hackers had stolen some 40 million payment card records and accessed 70 million customers' records. Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus has also disclosed a data breach that compromised data from about 1.1 million cards.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation last week warned retailers to expect more attacks and said the agency has reviewed 20 incidents over the past year that were similar to the recent breaches.Michaels said federal investigators and an outside forensics firm were investigating to determine if there had been a breach. The company said it decided to warn the public and launch a probe into the matter after hearing that there had been an increase in fraud involving cards of customers who had shopped at its stores.It was not immediately clear how many cards might have been affected, when an attack might have occurred, or whether the systems were currently compromised. A Michaels representative declined to elaborate on the statement.U.S. Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan told Reuters his agency was investigating the matter.PLANNING TO GO PUBLICMichaels, whose major investors are Blackstone Group LP  and Bain Capital LP, last year filed documents with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to go public. The company resubmitted its IPO documents late last month following a restructuring.In a high-profile 2011 attack, hackers replaced some 84 PIN pads on payment-card terminals at a small number of Michaels stores, resulting in the theft of about 94,000 payment card numbers, according to Department of Justice attorneys who eventually prosecuted two men charged in that case. (http://reut.rs/1fekNaX)Last year the Irving, Texas-based retailer settled a class-action consumer lawsuit related to the matter, without admitting to any wrongdoing.Michaels disclosed the 2011 attack in an S-1 registration statement that it filed with the Securities and Exchange in March of last year.""This would be devastating for them because this is the second time in a row,"" said Gartner security analyst Avivah Litan. ""The public and the credit card companies are going to slap their wrist twice as hard because they'll say they haven't learned their lesson and that they can't be trusted.""But that criticism might be tempered somewhat, given that other retailers have been breached, Litan said.The FBI has warned retailers about cyber criminals using ""memory-parsing"" software, also known as ""RAM scrapers."" When a customer swipes a payment card at checkout, the computer grabs data from the magnetic strip and transfers it to the retailer's payment processing provider. While the data is encrypted during the process, RAM scrapers extract the information from the computer's live memory, where it briefly appears in plain text.RAM scraping technology has been around for a long time, but its use has increased in recent years and cyber criminals have added features to make it more difficult for victims to detect the malicious software on their networks.""They have gotten much more sophisticated,"" said Daniel Clemens, chief executive of the cyber security firm Packet Ninjas, whose firm investigates credit card breaches at retailers. ""We are in a cycle where the incidence of these attacks will just continue to grow.""(Reporting by Jim Finkle.

7,BUSINESS,States With The Least Government Benefits: 24/7 Wall St.,"24/7 Wall St., 24/7 Wall St.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/states-government-benefit_us_5bb30746e4b0480ca661d6d8,"Right now, the states already bear a substantial burden.

While the federal government offers various assistance programs to U.S. residents in need — anything from unemployment benefits to food stamps — the states provide additional services and benefits.Right now, the states already bear a substantial burden. They pay for public pension plans, unemployment insurance, education, Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF), among other benefits. However, while most states fund many of these social programs, the amounts and levels they spend vary widely. 24/7 Wall St. identified the states that guaranteed the most benefits in these five categories, and the states that guaranteed the least.(Click here to see the states with the most government benefits)For the most part, states that spent the most in one program tend to spent the most overall. Rhode Island, which ranked as the top-spending state this year, spent in the top 15 in all five measures we considered. Similarly, states that were close to the bottom of our list for doling out benefits and services spent less than average in nearly every spending category.However, this was not always the case. States like New York, which spent the most in the country on education per pupil and second-most in the country on Medicaid per enrollee, paid the fourth-lowest weekly unemployment benefits relative to lost wages.The reasons some states spend more than others on benefits and programs is complicated. One factor that seems to be consistently true across the top and bottom spenders is the political climate. Of the 10 states that ranked as the most generous, nine voted Democratic in the last presidential election, with Alaska as the exceptions. Of the 10 states that spent the least on their social programs, all but one — Florida — voted Republican.The political climate can also influence how much a state collects in taxes, with Democratic states collecting more than Republican states. States that spent more on benefits were also more likely to have higher median incomes, which mean that tax bases were also higher. In fact, all five of the states with the highest median income are among the top spenders on social programs. Most of the least generous states have among the lowest median incomes in the country.There does not appear to be a relationship between the relative needs of a state’s residents for social programs and the state’s spending. Of the states that spent the most on weekly Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance, for example, the vast majority had among the lowest poverty rates in the country.In an interview with 24/7 Wall St, Michael Leachman, director of state fiscal research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, explained that it’s hard to explain why states that have a greater need for public assistance spend less, while states with better-off populations spend more on benefits. “You wonder if it isn’t to some extent a case of chicken-and-egg,” he said. “In the states that have urban, higher income populations… there’s money there, and the politics have evolved to encourage spending on public programs. But it is a difficult question to answer.”In order to assess how much or how little a state guarantees in benefits and services, 24/7 Wall St. examined spending by each state on a number of different programs. We considered average pension benefit payments per beneficiary as well as per pupil spending, both published by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 2011 fiscal year. Pension benefits include both state and local pensions, while per pupil spending reflects the total from all sources of funding. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment & Training Administration provided unemployment insurance figures, calculated over a 12-month period ending in the third quarter of 2013. Information on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families figures is from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). Medicaid payments per enrollee for fiscal 2010 are from the Kaiser Family Foundation. While states receive partial federal funding for TANF and Medicaid, they have considerable discretion over how to implement these programs. All data used were for the most recent available year.Here are the states with the least government benefits, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"
