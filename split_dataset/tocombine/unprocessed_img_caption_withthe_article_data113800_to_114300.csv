(AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b6b2400004f0024ecda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Natalia Zinets and Richard BalmforthKIEV, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Monday it was in talks with Moscow over the return of 311 Ukrainian soldiers and border guards who had been forced by fighting with separatists to cross into Russia, but Russian border authorities said the troops were seeking asylum.Both sides seemed set to use the fate of the troops to score propaganda points as Ukrainian government forces extended steady gains it has made against the pro-Russian separatists since a Malaysian airliner was downed over a rebel-held area on July 17.Ukrainian defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said a group of soldiers and border guards, who had been caught between the Russian border to the east and rebel positions in the west, had crossed into Russia in the early hours of Monday.He put their number at 311, telling a news briefing they had retreated into Russia for safety reasons after helping their comrades break through rebel lines.Kiev, he said, was now negotiating with Russian authorities for their return.In Moscow, authorities acknowledged that Ukrainian troops had crossed into Russian territory - though they put the number at 438 - and Russian border guards said they had crossed during the night seeking asylum.""They were tired of the war and wanted no further part in it,"" Vasily Malayev, spokesman for the border guards in the Rostov region of Russia, told Reuters by telephone. However, he added that 180 would be returned to Ukraine later on Monday.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to Itar-Tass and Rossiya24 TV, said Russia would facilitate the return of the Ukrainian soldiers but suggested they would be vulnerable to prosecution for desertion once they returned home.""I expect Ukrainian authorities to understand that it is absolutely unacceptable, when Ukrainians ... are forced to fight with their own people, to treat those who refuse to do so as traitors to the motherland,"" Lavrov said. RAILWAY HUBUkrainian government forces recaptured the important railway hub of Yasynuvata on Sunday from the rebels, Lysenko said, adding that five soldiers had been killed and 15 others wounded in fighting in the 24 hours up to Monday.However, the rebels, who seized Yasynuvata - which lies just north of the city of Donetsk - in May, denied that government forces had retaken the railway hub.Government troops, who have been battling the rebels since April, have now all but encircled the separatists' second-largest stronghold of Luhansk and rebels have declared a ""state of siege"" in Donetsk, the largest city they hold.Luhansk has been left without electricity or running water and the mobile network is also down, local officials said.At the crash site of the Malaysian Boeing, international experts resumed their recovery and investigative work on Monday.""After a delay due to fighting, the team of Australians, Dutch and Malaysian experts began work,"" a statement by the Dutch mission said.A large group of international experts began work there on Friday after a lull in fighting in the area allowed them finally, after lengthy delays, to reach the site. The victims included 196 Dutch, 27 Australians and 43 Malaysians.

In March, he appointed Joseph Ponte, a longtime corrections official from Maine with a reputation as a reformer.Prosecutors acknowledged that de Blasio and Ponte inherited many of the problems, which have been pervasive for years despite some small reform-minded undertakings during the final years of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's tenure.But the theme repeated throughout their 80-page report was that violence permeates the three Rikersfacilities for 16- to 18-year-olds.The investigators found particular problems in the main jail that houses young inmates, the Robert N. Davoren Complex, where new correction officers are assigned to ""one of the most combustible environments at Rikers, ill-equipped to cope with adolescents who are often belligerent and suffer from a wide range of mental illnesses and behavioral disorders,"" assistant U.S. attorneys Jeffrey Powell and Emily Daughtry wrote.They found that jail guards too often struck inmates in the face and head with closed fists while staff and potential witnesses are instructed not to report uses of force.The consultant used by the federal prosecutors said that in reviewing hundreds of correctional systems, he had never seen such a high rate of head shots, use-of-force rate and such pervasive inmate-on-inmate violence.In one August 2013 case detailed by the investigators, four unidentified inmates suffered broken noses, perforated eardrums, head trauma and facial injuries during a ""brutal use of force"" involving multiple guards in a trailer where school classes are held — and again later when they were handcuffed in a clinic holding area.In that case, the inmates told the federal consultant they were assaulted after getting into an argument with a jail guard. Correction officers disputed that account, writing in reports to their bosses that the inmates jumped an officer and confronted others who came to the guard's aid.There is no video of the encounter and, nearly a year after it occurred, corrections investigative reports were not completed, the federal government lawyers noted. What's more, in the initial use-of-force reports, the officers used similar wording of how the fight went down, ""suggesting that the officers may have colluded with each other to ensure their reports were consistent.""That case is representative of others, the federal attorneys found, noting that when uses-of-force occur, their reporting is widely inconsistent and subsequent investigations are regularly incomplete, untimely and often inconsequential.Four officers were involved in 50 to 76 use-of-force incidents at Davoren complex between 2007 and 2012.""The officer with the highest number of uses of force during the six-year period (76) was disciplined only once during this time,"" they wrote. ""Most of the others were disciplined once or twice, and some never.""Last fiscal year, there were 489 adolescent inmates, down from 682 in fiscal year 2013, when the average jail stint for 16- to 18-year-olds was 76 days. More than half had a mental health diagnosis. When they break jailhouse rules, such as refusing to obey orders or being verbally assaultive, they are sent to punitive segregation, a 23-hour lock-in essentially the same as solitary confinement.In one 21-month period, an average of 150 inmates received such punishment each month, resulting in a total of 143,823 days in solitary.At Rikers, the federal attorneys detailed dozens of changes that should be made, including moving all the youth inmates to a facility off Rikers supervised by experienced, better-trained guards; installing more video cameras; instituting a zero-tolerance policy for not reporting uses of force; and developing top-down training for staff.___Associated Press reporter Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report."

Facing tough questions from Congress, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the crisis on Wall Street has changed since the $700 billion bailout was first passed by Congress and he now wants to use the money to directly shore up banks instead of buying up bad loans. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d1b5200000070201d16f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional battles over the Export-Import Bank and terrorism insurance are an opportunity for Democrats to win back corporate elites who abandoned the party after the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, according to one of that law's primary architects, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.).Business leaders, Frank said, have begun to focus on the ""increasing domination by the Republican Party now by the people who don't believe in reasonable governance of the sort that the business community needs.""""I think this is finally starting to get to the business community now,"" he told HuffPost during a July interview. ""Part of this was the real significance of the defeat of [then-House Majority Leader] Eric Cantor. Eric Cantor was one of [Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd] Blankfein's best friends in government. His wife used to work [at Goldman] and they were personally friendly -- of course, a great recipient of money. And then Cantor loses and now Kevin McCarthy shifts his position on the Export-Import Bank.""The Export-Import Bank is a government agency that backs cheap loans to foreign companies that want to buy American-made goods, effectively providing a trade subsidy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other corporate interest groups strongly support it.Many liberals in the past have criticized the Ex-Im Bank as an engine of corporate welfare, since a tremendous portion of its work benefits just a handful of large companies. But in recent months, Democrats have closed ranks in defense of the agency, as the conservative groups Club for Growth and Heritage Action have pressed to let its authorization expire at the end of September. McCarthy, the new House majority leader, has also come out in favor of closing down the bank. The agency finances about 2 percent of U.S. exports.""I wish we lived in a world where there were no export subsidies,"" Frank said, but shutting the bank would be ""a clear case of unilateral disarmament.""""Let me put it this way,"" he said. ""If I knew that there were subsidies being cut off to Boeing, I would recommend that people buy stock in [French airplane manufacturer] Airbus. ... As long as other countries subsidize their exports, we would be putting our guys at a competitive disadvantage.""While many members of the business elite are die-hard Republicans, some are Democrats, and even those allied with the GOP often side with Democrats on social issues. Nearly all of them, however, lobby for government help in the form of tax loopholes or more direct subsidies. With GOP hardliners trying to eliminate government aid on exports, housing and terrorism insurance, Frank sees an opportunity to bring more corporate titans into the Democratic fold.""Some of the ... business guys say, 'Okay, I don't agree with [Republicans] on abortion and gay rights, but those aren't their real issues. Their real issues are the economy.' And now I think they have a serious problem,"" Frank said. ""A lot of the business people supported Obama in '08 ... and then we really pissed them off mightily with the financial reform bill."" ""I believe one of the major things people want from politicians is psychic income,"" Frank continued. ""They want to be told that they are wonderful people, that their jobs are important for the human race, that they contribute greatly. Lloyd Blankfein was not really kidding when he said that, 'We are doing God's work.' That's his inner feeling. I don't think that the [Dodd-Frank] legislation really hurt them much, and I think a lot of them, frankly, some of them welcome it because they're not under competitive pressure to do stupid things -- now, nobody can do them. But we really hurt their feelings mightily, particularly the president. You've seen that with these ridiculous statements from [Blackstone Group CEO] Steve Schwarzman going on about Nazis.""That thin skin, according to Frank, led a lot of wealthy business executives to back politicians who didn't have the best interests of their pocketbooks at heart. ""And so in '10 and '12, they went overwhelmingly to the Republicans. And I said to Blankfein and [JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie] Dimon and the others, 'You know, this is a little frustrating to me, because you're giving money to people who take irresponsible positions and then you are looking to me to protect you from them -- people you've given money to. But I think that's now become an increasing problem for them.""More than a year ago, the House Financial Services Committee passed a bill that would eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without providing any other government support for the housing market. The legislation is vehemently opposed by the banking industry and has not been taken up for a vote on the House floor. House Republicans are also tussling over a program started in the aftermath of Sept. 11, in which taxpayers shoulder most of the losses from terrorist attacks. The private sector has struggled to find ways to price insurance and mitigate the financial risk associated with terrorism.""The notion that a private business should have the responsibility of deterring terrorism is dumb,"" Frank said. ""What, do you put drones on the roof?""But the biggest battle is currently over the Ex-Im Bank. While Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) and some old-guard liberals remain critical of the agency, Frank's position is carrying the day among congressional Democrats. In addition to corporate lobbying groups like the Chamber of Commerce, labor unions strongly support the bank.To illustrate the value of the Ex-Im Bank, Frank described a project from the Clinton years: ""Here's the deal. When you're making things for the Pentagon, you're not going to have to worry about costs. But when you're making things for the private market, that's tougher. And the habits and factories that make military equipment are not really nearly efficient enough to compete in the private sector because the Pentagon has had this lavish flow of funds. But Raytheon was bidding on a project in Brazil ... to keep the rainforests from being depleted. ... They had what they thought was the best project, but they were being undercut by heavy subsidies from the Italian and French governments for their companies. And we got Ex-Im, I called the guys at Ex-Im at the time and said, 'All I want you to do is equal what the Italians and French are doing. I would like for us to take their subsidies out of the equation and let them compete on the merits.' And they won.""That very process, of course, is what bothers the bank's critics. ""I don't think the Ex-Im Bank is ... very open. It's too secretive,"" Ralph Nader told the Heritage Foundation's Daily Signal in June. ""And also it doesn't have a real strategy other than who knocks on their door the hardest and who gets someone to make calls from members of Congress."""
3,WORLDPOST,MSF Official: Constant Wave Of Casualties Strains Gaza's Fragile Health System,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gaza-msf_n_5637796.html,,2014-08-03,"Palestinian medics take a break after carrying wounded people injured from an Israeli strike in Shijaiyah neighborhood, into the emergency room at Gaza City's Shifa hospital, Wednesday, July 30, 2014. Israeli strikes hit a crowded shopping area in the neighborhood, hours after tank shells tore through the walls of a U.N. school crowded with war refugees Wednesday in the deadliest of a series of air and artillery attacks that push the Palestinian death toll above 1,300 in more than three weeks of fighting. (AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b562600005300709927.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than three weeks of conflict between Israeli forces and militants in Gaza have left over 1,700 Palestinians and more than 60 Israelis dead, while Gaza's Ministry of Health says more than 9,000 Palestinians are wounded. Gaza's hospitals are struggling to cope with the large number of casualties.The WorldPost spoke to Doctors Without Borders (MSF) medical coordinator Audrey Landmann about the medical situation in the enclave. Landmann is responsible for MSF activities in Gaza and returned from the war zone last week. MSF has worked in the area for over ten years and has an international team of doctors at Gaza City's main hospital al-Shifa. The organization also operates a clinic and brings in medical supplies.What is the medical situation like in Gaza right now?Gaza is a very dangerous place at the moment. Hospitals and ambulances have been targeted, and medical staff have died. It is difficult to bring people who have been injured to hospitals. And when people are able to reach hospital, the medics are under great pressure because of the huge amount of patients, especially in the emergency rooms. Gaza had a fragile health system before the current conflict -- a shortage of essential drugs, lack of medical supplies, and a lot of power cuts made it difficult to operate medical equipment. Now add the pressures of war. One doctor told us they have used 15-days worth of medical supplies in the last 24 hours.There is a constant wave of casualties and many need multiple procedures, requiring a long stay in the hospital. Therefore, people are forced to share beds in hospital because there are too many patients. Others have to leave the hospital still in a critical condition. Some are not able to reach their homes due to the violence and have to stay at relatives' houses. The sanitary conditions are sometimes terrible. For example, one Palestinian nurse I know has a three-room apartment that is housing 40 people at the moment. What longer-term impact will the war have on the medical system in Gaza?I expect that the hospitals that have been damaged in the shelling will be repaired. I'm more worried about the follow-up medical attention for patients. We saw after previous wars in Gaza that people needed secondary follow-up care and surgeries. Now the system is more fragile than ever. A second challenge is the mental health follow-up. There is the immediate trauma and then the follow up mental health care as people develop symptoms in the coming weeks. Right now people are in survival mode. A lot of people are in shock and won't allow themselves to think, they are just concerned about how to get their children to safety. People are completely terrorized, tired, and there is no way to escape this tiny piece of land. Almost every day a part of Gaza is evacuated and people don't know where to go. They face constant bombardment. Sometimes there is bombing and shelling for 12 hours in a row. There is no place they feel safe. Parents worry for their children, and children have been completely traumatized by what they saw. Some families were completely destroyed. In one of our clinics there were three sisters and a father who were wounded -- they lost seven siblings and their mother. Have you seen a lot of people seeking shelter in hospitals around Gaza? I saw people starting to arrive at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after the ground operation began in the nearby neighborhood of Shujaiyeh in mid-July. In these first few days the UN was still able to take people to their shelters. But now the UN shelters are full and people are afraid to go to them after UN facilities were bombed. What is appalling is that they arrive at the hospital with nothing. They are sitting on the ground, trying to put up sheets over their heads for shelter. Some organizations have delivered food vouchers - so the displaced get at least one meal per day - and have tried to truck in water. But the organizations have a lot of problems moving around to deliver aid because of the bombing. Some aid workers have died trying to deliver supplies. At the last count there were around 2,000 people seeking refuge in the grounds of Shifa hospital. Now the same thing is happening at Nasser hospital, south Gaza's main hospital, after the Israeli army recently asked people in east Khan Younis to evacuate. They still have a sense of safety coming to the hospital, but I am not confident it will remain safe.What sort of conditions are doctors in Gaza working in at the moment?The Palestinian medical staff are real heroes. They are working for hours, often without eating or taking a break. They are exhausted, and emotionally impacted by the casualties. The doctors are very well organized and they are trying their best. They are working knowing that even in the hospitals, they aren't safe. This interview was conducted on July 31. It was condensed and edited for clarity.  "

Graduates of the school are commissioned as 2nd lieutenants in the Air Force.The probe was announced following a report in the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper, which chronicled a pattern of recruiting irregularities, preferential treatment given to student-athletes by certain professors, drug use by cadets, and alcohol-fueled parties.While Johnson's statement referenced the misconduct in general terms, the Gazette reported that at a Dec. 2011 off-campus party, cadets smoked ""spice,"" a synthetic compound that mimics the effects of marijuana.Some athletes at the party also may have plied women with so-called ""date-rape"" drugs, the newspaper said. The alleged victims had no recollection of what may have happened to them, and no criminal charges were filed, it said.When Johnson was appointed last year as the first female superintendent in the academy's 60-year history, it was widely viewed as an effort to change the culture at the school.In 2003, reports surfaced that dozens of female Air Force Academy cadets had been sexually assaulted by fellow cadets over the previous decade, but that academy officials ignored or downplayed their complaints.The Gazette reported that in the 2012-2013 school year, 45 Air Force cadets reported sexual assaults, representing ""nearly two-thirds"" of all assaults reported at the nation's three major military academies.Johnson said she has met with the athletic department's leadership, whom she said have vowed to be more vigilant.""They've implemented several programs to ensure all cadet-athletes are living up to the Air Force's core values,"" she said.

It says the military is close to completing its main objective of destroying cross-border infiltration tunnels from Gaza and prepared to resume strikes in response to any future attacks by the Palestinians.Hamas, whose envoys are in Egypt for truce negotiations that Israel has shunned in anger at Friday's lethal ambush in Rafah, saw a possible ruse in the humanitarian truce announcement.""The calm Israel declared is unilateral and aims to divert attention away from the Israeli massacres. We do not trust such a calm and we urge our people to exercise caution,"" said the group's spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri.Israel launched its offensive on July 8 following a surge in Hamas rocket salvoes. It escalated from air and naval barrages to overland incursions centered on Gaza's tunnel-riddled eastern frontier but also pushing into densely populated towns.Gaza officials say 1,788 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed and more than a quarter of the impoverished enclave's 1.8 million residents displaced. As many as 3,000 Palestinian homes have been destroyed or damaged.""DISGRACEFUL SHELLING""Many of those evacuees took shelter in U.N.-run facilities, including a Rafah school where 10 people were killed on Sunday in what Gaza officials said was an Israeli air strike.Israel said it was investigating the incident and that it may have been linked to an attempt by the military to kill gunmen from Hamas' kindred faction, Islamic Jihad, as they drove nearby.International outcry crested against the Israelis.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described the attack as a ""moral outrage and a criminal act"" and called for those responsible for the ""gross violation of international humanitarian law"" to be held accountable.The United States said it was ""appalled"" by the ""disgraceful shelling"" and urged its Middle East ally to do more to prevent harm to civilians. Washington also called for an investigation into other, similar attacks on U.N. schools in Gaza.Israel says it makes every effort to avoid non-combatant casualties and that Hamas invites these by launching rockets from and entrenching gunmen inside congested civilian areas.""Hamas has an interest in Gaza residents suffering, thinking that the world will blame Israel for their suffering,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement on Monday, adding that Israel was allowing foreign aid shipments to enter the Palestinian territory.The statement said Hamas had further inflamed the humanitarian crisis by turning U.N. facilities into ""terrorist hotspots"". The main U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, says it has found rockets in three of its schools.Israel has lost 64 soldiers in combat and three civilians to Palestinian cross-border shelling that has emptied many of its southern villages. Iron Dome interceptors, air raid sirens and public shelters have helped stem Israeli casualties from the Gazan rockets.Egyptian truce mediation, supported by the United States and the United Nations and also involving Qatar, Turkey and Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, has been complicated by the dramatically divergent terms set by Israel and Hamas.Israel has said Gaza must be stripped of tunnels and rocket stocks. Hamas rules this out, and demands an easing of the crippling Gaza blockade enforced by both Israel and Egypt, which consider the Palestinian Islamists a security threat.In Cairo on Sunday, Palestinian delegates said they also wanted Israel to quit Gaza, facilitate reconstruction of the battered territory and release Palestinian prisoners.The Israelis, however, have shown little interest in resuming negotiations after blaming Hamas for violating Friday's truce with the Rafah ambush - an accusation echoed by the United States and the United Nations, though disputed by Hamas.

Dianne Fenistein (D-Calif.) announced on Friday. The committee's report on the CIA's use of harsh interrogation and detention techniques in the post-9/11 era was expected to be released in the coming days, and has much of Washington on edge. U.S. officials have said that the report will conclude that the Bush-era tactics were unnecessary and accuse some CIA officials of misleading Congress about the program's effectiveness.After receiving the redacted report from the White House, Feinstein announced that the wider release of the report would be delayed ""until further notice,"" McClatchy reports.More of Feinstein's statement from Roll Call:The committee this afternoon received the redacted executive summary of our study on the CIA detention and interrogation program.The news of the delayed release followed President Barack Obama's admission on Friday that in the aftermath of 9/11: ""We tortured some folks. We did some things that were contrary to our values."" Obama also expressed his support for CIA director John Brennan, despite a report that CIA employees spied on computers used by the Senate Intelligence Committee during their investigation, which Brennan had adamantly denied to Congress. Several lawmakers have called for Brennan's resignation.Citing Feinstein, Roll Call reports that Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) expressed concern about “the excessive redactions” to the report on interrogation tactics, adding ""especially given the president's unequivocal commitment to declassifying the Senate Intelligence Committee's study."" The Washington Examiner notes that the Committee's review of the CIA redactions could take weeks.It is not known what parts of the report have been redacted, according to McClatchy. The extensive investigation into CIA practices found abuse that Feinstein called ""chilling.""

The algae growth is fed by phosphorus mainly from farm fertilizer runoff and sewage treatment plants, leaving behind toxins that have contributed to oxygen-deprived dead zones where fish can't survive. The toxins can kill animals and sicken humans. Ohio's fourth-largest city, Toledo, told residents late Saturday Aug. 2, 2014 not to drink from its water supply that was fouled by toxins possibly from algae on Lake Erie. (AP Photo/NOAA)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15ba1260000e9008187bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — More tests are needed to ensure that toxins are out of Toledo's water supply, the mayor said Sunday, instructing the 400,000 people in the region to avoid drinking tap water for a second day.Mayor D. Michael Collins said although new samples have shown the level of toxins in the water has decreased, ""this is not over yet.""Toledo officials issued the warning early Saturday after tests at one treatment plant showed two sample readings for microsystin above the standard for consumption, possibly because of algae on Lake Erie. The city also said not to boil the water because that would only increase the toxin's concentration. The mayor also warned that children should not shower or bathe in the water and that it shouldn't be given to pets.Long lines quickly formed at water distribution centers and store shelves were emptied of bottled water. The warning effectively cut off the water supply to Toledo, most of its suburbs and a few areas in southeastern Michigan.Worried residents told not to drink, brush their teeth or wash dishes with the water waited hours for deliveries of bottled water from across Ohio as the governor declared a state of emergency.Gov. John Kasich pledged that state agencies were working to bring water and other supplies to areas around Toledo while also assisting hospitals and other businesses affected.""What's more important than water? Water's about life,"" Kasich said. ""We know it's difficult. We know it's frustrating.""The governor said it was too early to say how long the water advisory will last or what caused toxins to spike suddenly in the drinking water.""We don't really want to speculate on this,"" Kasich said. ""When it comes to this water, we've got be very careful.""Families toting empty coolers, milk jugs and even cookie jars topped them off with well water funneled out of the back of a pickup truck.John Myers, a farmer from nearby Swanton, loaded 450 gallons of well water into a container in his pickup Saturday and gave it out for free in a high school parking lot.""The more you got, the more we'll fill,"" he told residents carrying empty containers. ""I never thought I'd see the day that I'd be giving water away.""Myers said his concern was that the advisory could go on for days. ""This is a lot more serious than anybody's thinking about,"" he said.Tyshanta DeLoney, of Toledo, filled up a big plastic container after spending much of the day searching for water. ""That was a blessing,"" she said.Late Saturday, Kasich ordered the state's National Guard to deliver water purification systems, pallets of bottled water and meals ready to eat, or MREs, to residents in Lucas, Wood and Fulton counties.The first tests indicating trouble came Friday night and additional testing confirmed the elevated readings, said Craig Butler, director of the state's Environmental Protection Agency.Water coming from the lake into Toledo's water plant had relatively low toxicity levels this summer compared with a year ago until this sudden spike.Algae blooms during the summer have become more frequent and troublesome around the western end of Lake Erie, the shallowest of the five Great Lakes.The algae growth is fed by phosphorus mainly from farm fertilizer runoff and sewage treatment plants, leaving behind toxins that have contributed to oxygen-deprived dead zones where fish can't survive. The toxins can kill animals and sicken humans.Scientists had predicted a significant bloom of the blue-green algae this year, but they didn't expect it to peak until early September.There were no reports yet of people becoming sick from drinking the water, Collins said.Stores in cities up to 50 miles away were reporting shortages of bottled water. Some neighboring communities that aren't connected to Toledo's water system were offering their water to people who brought their own bottles and containers.Operators of water plants all along Lake Erie, which supplies drinking water for 11 million people, have been concerned over the last few years about toxins fouling their supplies.Almost a year ago, one township just east of Toledo told its 2,000 residents not to drink or use the water coming from their taps. That was believed to be the first time a city has banned residents from using the water because of toxins from algae in the lake.Most water treatment plants along the western Lake Erie shoreline treat their water to combat the algae. Toledo spent about $4 million last year on chemicals to treat its water and combat the toxins. "

Peter Lerner said Friday, Aug. 1, 2014 that Goldin was apparently captured by Hamas militants who came through a tunnel from the Gaza Strip and another two soldiers were killed. An hour after Friday's cease-fire started, gunmen emerged from one or more Gaza tunnels and opened fire at Israeli soldiers, with at least one of the militants detonating an explosives vest, said Lerner. Goldin was apparently captured during the ensuing mayhem and taken back into Gaza through a tunnel.

Israel began its air and naval offensive against Gaza on July 8 following a surge of cross-border rocket salvoes by Hamas and other guerrillas, later escalating into ground incursions.Shelling exchanges continued on Saturday, pushing the Gaza death toll given by Palestinian officials to 1,675, most of them civilians. Israel has confirmed that 64 soldiers have died in combat, while Palestinian shelling has also killed three civilians in Israel.More than 30 tunnels and dozens of access shafts have been unearthed and were being blown up, the military said.""Our understanding is that our objectives, most importantly the destruction of the tunnels, are close to completion,"" a military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner, said.Netanyahu said in a televised speech on Saturday evening that military action would continue even after that goal was achieved.""After completing the anti-tunnel operation, the IDF will act and continue to act, in accordance with our security needs and only according to our defense needs, until we achieve our objective of restoring security to you, Israel's citizens,"" he said. 'PAY FOR EVERY MINUTE'A Hamas spokesman said: ""Netanyahu will pay for every minute he spends carrying out more aggression against our people.""Several ceasefires between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that dominates the Gaza Strip, have failed to take hold or quickly collapsed, most recently on Friday after the ambush in which Goldin and the two other soldiers were killed.In Cairo, a Palestinian delegation arrived for new truce talks, which would include Hamas' demand that Egypt ease movement across its border with blockaded Gaza. Turning its back on those negotiations, Israel said it would not send envoys as scheduled.""They (Hamas) cannot be trusted to keep their word. They cannot stop (firing) because, for them, a ceasefire at this stage, whether by arrangement or not by arrangement, would mean acknowledging the worst possible defeat,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israel's Channel Two TV.Hamas, its guerrillas massively outgunned by a Jewish state it considers an eternal enemy, said it would prevail.Any unilateral pullout by Israel would mean ""it has failed to achieve any of its goals and would be a clear defeat for the occupation army and for its leaders,"" Hamas' bloc in the Palestinian parliament said in a statement. ""Gaza resisted, endured and will achieve victory."" 'EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE'Israel said Palestinians on Saturday launched 86 rockets across the border, most of which missed their intended targets and fell harmlessly wide, while seven were shot down by its Iron Dome interceptor, including over Tel Aviv.Crowded Gazan towns close to the Israeli border have seen devastating clashes and the flight of tens of thousands of Palestinians as tanks and troops swept in to confront dug-in guerrillas.The Palestinian Center for Human Rights said 520,000 people had been displaced by the fighting - more than a quarter of Gaza's population.Israel on Saturday told evacuees from Beit Lahiya, a northern town of 70,000 residents, they could return, but fear still gripped the townspeople.""No one has told us to go back,"" said Talab Manna, a 30-year-old father of seven camped out at a U.N.-run school serving as a refugee haven. ""We can't risk going back and being bombed by the Israeli forces.""Hamas had long threatened to capture Israelis for a prisoner swap. In 2011, Israel released more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit, a soldier snatched by Hamas five years earlier. Israel has twice freed prisoners for the bodies of soldiers held by Lebanon's Hezbollah militia.The Rafah clash in which Goldin was initially reported to have been captured, triggered Israeli shelling from the middle of Friday morning that killed 150 Palestinians. By afternoon, Israel declared an end to the truce - which was meant to have lasted 72 hours.Rafah residents said they had received recorded telephone warnings from Israel to stay indoors during a barrage that wreaked widespread ruin.""It was like an action movie - explosions everywhere, cars flying up in flames, people crushed under houses that were bombed,"" local resident Bassim Abed told Reuters.

Bush's administration.""We did some things that were contrary to our values,"" Obama said.Republicans on the committee have long disagreed with Democrats about the use of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, and they largely boycotted the committee's probe.""I thought it was a mistake then. I still think it is a mistake,"" Chambliss said on CBS.The investigation has been plagued with difficulties. The CIA conceded last week it had improperly monitored computers used by committee investigators looking into the torture allegations.The revelation prompted two Democratic senators to call for the resignation of CIA Director John Brennan, who took over the spy agency last year.Senate committee members appearing on Sunday television news shows did not call for Brennan's resignation, but said the CIA had committed a breach of trust that needed to be addressed.Arizona Republican Senator John McCain, a survivor of torture, said on the Fox News program ""Sunday Morning Futures"" he was in some ways more concerned about the CIA spying on Senate staffers than the torture issue, and he called for an independent investigation.U.S. Representative Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, warned against overreacting.""I don't think this is some conspiracy notion that they wanted to spy on either of our committees. That would of course be intolerable. I think it would be a crime,"" Rogers said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""But these were CIA computers at a CIA facility, he said. ""That's a little bit different than spying on Congress.""Senator Angus King, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the CIA's biggest mistake on the interrogations was not being able to admit a mistake.""They're still trying to justify it and argue it wasn't torture, which is nonsense,"" the Maine independent said on CNN.

Even during the best of times, one out of every three girls in Niger marries before her 15th birthday, a rate of child marriage among the highest in the world, according to a UNICEF survey. Now this custom is being layered on top of a crisis. At times of severe drought, parents pushed to the wall by poverty and hunger are marrying their daughters at even younger ages. A girl married off is one less mouth to feed, and the dowry money she brings in goes to feed others.

She had started having sex with him when she was 10 because, she said, he gave her money and small gifts, while her parents could not afford to feed her or buy her clothes.Chimwemwe, not her real name, became pregnant, and their families forced them to marry. When I interviewed her in September 2013, two years into her marriage, she said: ""I've never experienced happiness in my marriage. I've never seen the benefit of being married."" Her husband beat her, she often went without food and she had almost died giving birth.Chimwemwe dropped out of school in standard four (equivalent to fourth grade) but said she does not want to go back because ""I feel I was not good with books.""On July 22, the United Kingdom and Unicef, the United Nations children's agency, hosted the global Girl Summit 2014 in London to mobilize domestic and international efforts to end child, early and forced marriage, and female genital mutilation within a generation. Chimwemwe's story illustrates the challenge they are facing.The meeting will bring together governments, international donors, nongovernmental groups, activists, community and religious leaders and the private sector to adopt a plan for concrete action. Participants are expected to make commitments, and there are plans for a global process to track progress on carrying them out.Forum for Girls and WomenSignificantly, leaders will hear from girls and women who married as children. In my work, I have seen the devastating impact of child marriage on girls and women in countries such as South Sudan, Malawi and Tanzania. While the contexts were different, the stories they shared with me were similar.Girls were beaten, verbally abused, threatened or thrown out of their homes by their families for rejecting forced marriages. They were sexually abused and abandoned by their husbands, often left to care for children without any financial support.Child brides were financially dependent on often abusive spouses, in part because they lacked the education and skills to provide for themselves and their families. I heard stories about girls who were so broken by the forced marriages that they contemplated suicide. I also interviewed and was inspired by girls who made heroic efforts to escape this fate, to control their own lives. Too often, though, they didn't get the help they needed.Although some countries have made notable progress, there has been little change in global rates of child marriage. In this decade (2011-2020), 142 million girls worldwide will be married if current trends continue.More Girls, Communities Saying NoThe good news is that more communities and girls themselves are standing up to say no to child marriage. I have spoken to dozens of women and girls who, without any support, fled their abusive spouses or stood up to their families, often at great risk. And there is growing global momentum and support by nongovernmental organizations, international agencies, governments, and global leaders to address this problem, for example at the Human Rights Council in Geneva and at the African Union.This summit should support these efforts by making governments, international donors and others in a position to help to make commitments to address the multiple and interconnected factors driving child, early and forced marriage, and to promote girls' human rights.Knowing what does and doesn't work to end child, early and forced marriage should be a basic starting point. It is encouraging that one of the goals of the summit is to share best practices and understanding.Part of the problem has been a lack of documentation and evaluation of existing programs to end child marriage, so there is little information available on what approaches work, and in what contexts.Governments and donors need to shift the way they work, by supporting the systematic monitoring and evaluation of such programs. That way, they can channel their investments to efforts that bring about real change, and actually end child marriage within a generation. Without this smart and comprehensive approach, by both national governments and international donors, girls, women and communities will continue to suffer unnecessarily from the impact of child, early, and forced marriage.Agnes Odhiambo is a senior women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch covering sub-Saharan Africa.This post originally appeared on Women's eNews.

It was the third deadly attack on a U.N. school sheltering Palestinians during the 27-day conflict between Israel and Hamas militants.All three incidents are being investigated, but the United Nations has initially blamed Israel for Sunday's attack and another strike last Wednesday on a U.N.-run school in Jabalya refugee camp that killed at least 15 civilians.""The Israel Defense Forces have been repeatedly informed of the location of these sites,"" Ban's spokesman said in a statement.""This attack, along with other breaches of international law, must be swiftly investigated and those responsible held accountable. It is a moral outrage and a criminal act,"" the statement said.Israel began its offensive against Gaza on July 8 after a surge of cross-border rocket salvoes by Hamas and other guerrillas.The fighting on Sunday pushed the Gaza death toll given by Palestinian officials to 1,772, most of them civilians. Israel has confirmed that 64 soldiers have died in combat, while Palestinian rockets have also killed three civilians in Israel.Ban again demanded an end to the fighting and for the parties to begin negotiations in Cairo to address the underlying issues of the conflict.""The resurgence in fighting has only exacerbated the man-made humanitarian and health crisis wreaking havoc in Gaza,"" the statement said.

""The United States is appalled by today's disgraceful shelling outside an UNRWA school in Rafah sheltering some 3,000 displaced persons, in which ten more Palestinian civilians were tragically killed,"" reads the statement from State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki. ""We once again stress that Israel do more to meet its own standards and avoid civilian casualties."" Psaki continues: ""UN facilities, especially those sheltering civilians, must be protected, and must not be used as bases from which to launch attacks. The suspicion that militants are operating nearby does not justify strikes that put at risk the lives of so many innocent civilians.""Below, more from the Associated Press:In language that was rare in its directness and severity, the U.S. denounced in a statement issued Sunday the attack earlier in the day that killed 10 people, noting that the school had been designated a protected location.""The coordinates of the school, like all UN facilities in Gaza, have been repeatedly communicated to the Israel Defense Forces,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in the statement.
