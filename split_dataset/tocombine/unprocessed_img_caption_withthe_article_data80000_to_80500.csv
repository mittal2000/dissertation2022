""You could see the buying accelerating at mid-day and people saying 'I'm wrong', and starting to cover their shorts.""The Dow Jones industrial average finished 3.95 percent higher at 16,285.51.The S&P 500 gained 3.9 percent to 1,940.51 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.24 percent to end at 4,697.54.Data earlier on Wednesday appeared to strengthen the case for a rise in interest rates at a Fed policy meeting on Sept 16-17.Durable goods orders rose 2 percent in July, compared with analysts' average forecast of a 4 percent fall. Orders for core capital goods, a proxy for business investment, rose 2.2 percent in the biggest gain in 13 months.Following weeks of concerns about demand in China for iPhones, Apple shares provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite index, jumping 5.73 percent to $109.69.Up to Tuesday's close, the Dow had lost 10.71 percent in the past six trading days and the Nasdaq composite had shed 11.5 percent.The S&P is now down 5.8 percent in 2015.""We're still in a period of searching,"" said Kurt Brunner, a portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""You have more people taking advantage of upside. But we're in for some sloppy trading and I don't think it's over today. I don't think it's a straight shot up.""The recent pummeling in U.S. shares reduced valuations some investors had seen as pricey. The S&P 500's valuation was down to about 14.8 times expected earnings, compared to around 17 for much of 2015 and below a 15-year average of 15.7, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data for Tuesday, the most recent available.Google surged 7.72 percent after Goldman Sachs raised its rating to ""buy"" from ""neutral."" Amazon jumped 7.38 percent.NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,474 to 646. On the Nasdaq, 2,136 issues rose and 713 fell.Underscoring the market's frailty, the S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and 28 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded five new highs and 142 new lows.Volume was heavy, with about 10.5 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, far above the 7.6 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

1,MEDIA,Fox News Gets Schooled On Why WDBJ Shooting Isn't Necessarily An Anti-White Hate Crime,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-wdbj-shooting_us_55de2880e4b029b3f1b17c22,“He shot three white people today. Why is that not a hate crime?”,2015-08-26,"<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.1818180084229px; background-color: #eeeeee;"">A gunman shot and killed reporter Alison Parker, left, and cameraman Adam Ward, right, during a live news broadcast on Wednesday morning.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55de3c331400002e002e41e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hours after a gunman killed two journalists and wounded an interviewee during a live news broadcast Wednesday morning, Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson asked a question that may have also been on the minds of many of her viewers: If the alleged shooter was black and his victims were white, shouldn't this be labeled a racist hate crime?The answer, security expert Paul Viollis told her, is not that simple. The suspected gunman, 41-year-old Vester Lee Flanagan, on Wednesday sent a manifesto to ABC News, saying his ""tipping point"" was the June shooting of nine congregants at a historic black church in Charleston. In that case, the white gunman explicitly revealed his racist motivations and desire to kill black people in a brutal act of bigotry. But Viollis suggested that the available information on Flanagan is not enough to determine that the on-camera attack was racially motivated.“This is quintessential workplace violence, from the behavioral profile of the individual to the actions that he displayed, from the manifesto to the time he was terminated in 2013,” he said.Flanagan was fired in 2013 from news station WDBJ, the CBS affiliate in Roanoke, Virginia, where reporter Alison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, also worked. Parker and Ward were both killed in the shooting Wednesday, while a third victim, 61-year-old Vicki Gardner, who was being interviewed on air, is in stable condition.Memos issued by Flanagan's bosses prior to his termination and since obtained by The Guardian paint a picture of a problem employee who was unpredictable and at times aggressive. Flanagan himself admitted in the document sent to ABC News that he was a ""human powder keg ... just waiting to go BOOM."" He had also filed lawsuits against WDBJ and at least one other prior employer, alleging racial discrimination and other mistreatment. According to The Guardian, police were called to escort Flanagan out of the WDBJ offices after he was fired.But Carlson returned focus to the fact that Flanagan ""talked about race a lot"" in his manifesto.“He put the initials of the Charleston church shooting victims on the bullets that he used today, he praised the Virginia Tech mass killer, Columbine High School killers, says he was being attacked for being a gay black man,” she said. “He shot three white people today. Why is that not a hate crime?”Viollis again pointed to a more complex psychology that he said often serves as a backing for these outbursts of violence.“Because of the fact that the workplace violence offender is clearly delusional,” he explained. “They make up their own sense of reality, and they struggle with their sense of identity. So they don’t like who they are, they make up something that will envision them as a victim, as the quintessential victim. It’s the finger-pointing.”Viollis continued, “Hate crime is something where he clearly was motivated by sense of race, color or creed.”Carlson again said the alleged shooter's manifesto was clear evidence of such a motivation, but Viollis theorized that the ""tipping point"" Flanagan spoke of was rather the moment he decided it was time to engage in shocking, ""attention-seeking"" behavior.“He saw the attention that was received from that shooter all over the country, and that particular shooter was glorified on the news in his eyes,"" Viollis said. ""That’s why he picked this time of the day to shoot these two people.”[H/T Raw Story]"
2,BUSINESS,Why Even Women At The Very Top Can't Get Equal Pay,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/woman-ceos-equal-pay_us_55ddda2ae4b0a40aa3acf08a,The downsides of not being in the old boys' club.,2015-08-26,"<p>Indra Nooyi, the CEO of <span style=""color: #3d3c40; font-family: Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif; line-height: 22px; background-color: #ffffff;"">PepsiCo. New research finds that women in management see greater pay disparities with men than women in working-class jobs.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55dde0b2170000b700568a09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Happy Women's Equality Day! There's no better day to remember that women in America are still far from equal at work -- even at the very top. Three researchers at the New York Fed wrote in a blog post Tuesday that they found women in management see an even greater disparity in compensation between themselves and their male peers than women in working-class jobs. The post was a follow-up on an earlier NY Fed staff report on the same issue. The researchers said they found that female executives, quite simply, get screwed when it comes to compensation. They found that women at the top get less incentive pay -- things like stock and bonuses on top of their salary -- than their male counterparts. That tends to mean that they experience less of the upside when their companies do well and are more exposed to declines in their company's value when things go poorly than male executives.The researchers think that the reason this happens is because women tend to be younger and have looser networks than their male counterparts when they come into executive positions. Basically, women aren't in the old boys' club. This means that they aren't likely to have as many buddies on the board of the company as male CEOs. Boards approve executive compensation packages, so weaker networks can mean that women have less negotiating power when it comes to getting a package approved. A less friendly board, it turns out, often means fewer stock options. There is one bit of good news, according to Claudia Olivetti, an economist at Boston College and one of the researchers who published the study. ""The good news is that part of the gender differences in compensation can be explained by the fact that female executives tend to be younger and have shorter tenure than male executives -- there are very few women in the earlier cohorts,"" she said. ""So going forward, as more women get into the ranks of executives and start having longer tenure, things should improve.""(That, of course, assumes women will start breaking into the C-suite at higher rates, which is hardly a given.)The findings come just a few days after the SEC announced a new rule on how companies have to disclose executive pay. The new rule says that public companies have to publish the ratio of CEO pay to the pay of its median employees. Some people think this rule might embarrass companies into reducing CEO pay, although others, like Bloomberg View's Matt Levine, believe that ""all executive-pay rules have the effect of increasing executive pay."" This may also be bad news for women further down the pay scale. New research shows that incentive pay, also known as variable pay, is on the rise for employees at all levels of the company. Less fixed pay raises coupled with more variable pay allows companies to reward top employees without making a big commitment. While non-executive female employees don't have their pay structures approved by a board of directors, and therefore wouldn't have exactly the same problems as female CEOs, the realities of network effects remain the same. If there are more men at the top of the company making decisions on variable pay, are the people they feel more connected to -- that is, other men -- more likely to see higher rewards?It's a question worth asking."
3,MEDIA,How Most Major TV Networks Are Handling Footage Of The Virginia Shooting,Gabriel Arana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-shooting-footage-networks_us_55ddeb1fe4b08cd3359e2c02,"""If you find these kinds of things disturbing, please leave the room.""",2015-08-26,"<p>MSNBC generally freeze-frames footage before material gets violent, a spokesperson said. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55de37711d00002f00145fcd.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When footage of violence streams in from Iraq or photos of mass graves from Mexico’s drug war end up on an editor’s desk, news organizations are often placed in the difficult position of deciding how much disturbing material they should broadcast to their audience.Wednesday’s shooting in Virginia -- which left an anchor and photographer from local television news station WDBJ dead -- offered a case in point. Footage of the attack was captured live on air by the station itself and by the killer, who recorded the shooting and posted video on social media. The different ways the major TV networks have chosen to handle both pieces of footage shows there’s not necessarily a firm rule dictating when media outlets censor graphic material or pass it along. Most often, news organizations play it by ear, balancing the public’s need to know with the obligation not to spread trauma.On CNN, anchor Carol Costello warned viewers before airing a live video clip of the attack, initially saying the network would only play the clip once. “I want to warn you if you find these kinds of things disturbing, please leave the room,” Costello said.The CNN host later clarified that the network would only play the clip once per hour.A spokesperson for MSNBC said the network generally refrains from showing graphic video, opting instead to freeze-frame before the material gets violent. On its digital platforms, the organization allows only the first gunshot to be heard, then mutes the audio. The material also comes with a disclaimer warning of “graphic or disturbing content.”As of Wednesday evening, Fox News was not showing footage of the shooting, though the network was running still images of the shooter. A Fox News spokeswoman said the decision not to show the footage would continue to be evaluated as the story progressed.ABC is showing portions of the Virginia shooting video, but stopping the tape before shots ring out. “It’s similar to what we do with the South Carolina shooting,” a source at the network said. “You show parts but not the actual moment out of respect.”Dan Abrams, chief legal correspondent at ABC News, laid out the network's policy on the video in a series of tweets. The anchor said ABC would air parts of the footage up until the actual shooting.The question that lingers in the background of these decisions is whether showing the graphic content in full does, in fact, serve the public interest. What if watching disturbing material helps shock citizens into action?Journalists openly discussed on Twitter the ethics of transmitting the videos, which Columbia Journalism Review rounded up on its website. At National Review, Jim Geraghty laid out the case for presenting the video to the public, arguing that, perhaps, we ""owe it to the victims to not avert our eyes"":But I feel like there’s at least one compelling reason to show the video: this is the actual truth of what happened. The job of journalists is to inform the public of what happened. One of our great complaints about modern media is that it feels a paternalistic need to emphasize certain aspects and obscure others, often in service of a particular narrative, no? Abrams, on the other hand, expressed how he felt about this rationale:At The New Republic, Jeet Heer said there was good reason for the ""taboo"" against circulating images of killings. ""Showing and viewing such images is disrespectful of the dead and also painful to their loved ones,"" he said.""The moment of death, especially if it comes about in the terrifying form of murder, is deeply traumatic,"" Heer added. Editors here at The Huffington Post decided to use an edited version of the footage that opens with a warning, mutes the audio and blurs the footage when the shooting begins.If anyone wants to review the clip, it appears at the bottom of this article."

Shameka was one of three people stabbed, while the 52-year-old officer was shot as he responded to the incident.Surlay Johnson and Courtney Jolivette, the suspect's wife, were both stabbed in the attack at a home, and were taken to local hospitals. Shameka and Surlay Johnson are the sisters of Grand Coteau Mayor Shaterral Johnson.Officials characterized the motive as a possible domestic dispute. Riley is believed to have stabbed the three people, including the woman who died. Officer Nelson died of bullet wounds he received while responding to the attack at the house, which is about 70 miles west of Baton Rouge. The suspect fled by car to a convenience store. He drove through the front door and barricaded himself inside.Police used tear gas and negotiators to force Riley out. ""He was not coming out. He was ready to fight,"" Guidroz said. The suspect was eventually taken into custody, and evaluated at a local hospital. Police said he had an extensive criminal history.Guidroz said there weren't any hostages taken as earlier reports suggested, and that three people inside were able to escape. A witness took a photo of the aftermath and posted it to Instagram, saying the incident was like ""a movie."" The photo shows a car smashed through the side of the store and a body on the ground. It's unclear who the person in the photo is, and his or her condition is unknown. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal issued the following statement on the attack: ""Supriya and I are heartbroken to learn of another deadly assault on one of our public servants. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Sunset Police Officer Henry Nelson and the other victims as they endure this senseless tragedy."""
5,POLITICS,Environmental Groups Threaten To Sue EPA Over Fracking Wastewater Rules,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fracking-wastewater-lawsuit-epa_us_55de19ade4b0a40aa3ad440a,"Coalition cites outdated rules for disposing of wastewater, which can contain carcinogens and radioactive materials.",2015-08-26,"<p>A jar of fracking wastewater from Midland, Texas.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A coalition of environmental groups is threatening to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for not implementing new regulations on the disposal of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations.The organizations -- which include the Environmental Integrity Project and the Natural Resources Defense Council -- will file a lawsuit if the EPA does not issue rules explaining where and how oil and gas drillers should deal with the water left over from their operations, they told the agency on Wednesday. Hydraulic fracturing, often called fracking, uses a high-pressure stream of water, sand and chemicals to tap in to oil and gas reserves within rock formations. The environmental groups are concerned about wastewater injected into the ground -- an estimated 2 billion gallons a day, according to industry estimates -- and cite recent research linking wastewater injection sites to increased seismic activity in some parts of the United States. They also worry about the practice of spreading wastewater on fields and roads to deal with dust and drought, and about the lack of structural requirements for storing wastewater in landfills or ponds.Wastewater from fracking operations has been found to include carcinogens and radioactive components, they say.""Oil and gas waste is extremely dangerous -- yet the EPA admitted decades ago that federal rules are inadequate to protect the public,"" said Matthew McFeeley, an attorney at the NRDC, in a statement. ""Toxic waste should not be sent to run-of-the-mill landfills, sprayed on our roads and fields, or stored in open air pits.""The coalition wants the EPA to review and revise how it handles this wastewater under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs waste disposal. They say that while the RCRA requires the agency to review regulations at least every three years, it has been more than 25 years since oil and gas waste rules have been updated.If the EPA does not take action on fracking waste within 60 days, the coalition says it will file a lawsuit.""We will review the Notice of Intent and any related information submitted to EPA,"" agency spokeswoman Laura Allen told The Huffington Post in an email."

It seems to be working, so far. After threatening to leave the BSA to create its own scouting organization, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Wednesday that it felt properly reassured that it could continue to appoint Scout leaders who would uphold its ""religious and moral values.""""At this time, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will go forward as a chartering organization of BSA, and as in the past, will appoint Scout leaders and volunteers who uphold and exemplify Church doctrine, values, and standards,"" the church's top governing authorities said in a statement. The departure of the Mormons would have meant a significant financial hit for the BSA. The LDS church sponsors nearly 38,000 scouting units that serve 427,000 young boys, making it the largest national chartering organization, according to the Associated Press.The church has softened its tone on LGBT members in recent years, and even played a key role in backing an anti-discrimination bill in Utah. Still, it has refused to budge on doctrine, which bans gay marriage and considers acting on same-sex attractions to be a sin. Across the country, gay Mormons had mixed reactions to the church's announcement about the BSA. Most saw it as a good, albeit small, move in the right direction. Todd Richardson, senior vice president of the LGBT Mormon group Affirmation, said he was initially disheartened by the church's first statement about a possible separation from the BSA. But the recent reversal has made him happy.""As an Eagle Scout myself, I found [the BSA's] connection with my LDS congregation meaningful as I grew up. And while I would hope to see greater inclusion for LGBTQ people in our church, I see this as another small step forward,"" Richardson told HuffPost in an email.Wendy Montgomery, the mother of a gay LDS boy scout, said she was grateful that the church is continuing to partner with the BSA. However, she said the church would be losing out on the ""wealth of talent, vision, character and integrity"" that LGBT Mormon leaders would have provided.""This deeply saddens me as my own son, a 17-year old gay Eagle Scout, is less than a year away from leadership eligibility. Whether he chooses this path or not, the option should be open to him,"" Montgomery, of California, told HuffPost in an email. ""If he stays in a Mormon Scout troop, this door is solidly shut in his face.""  Also On HuffPost: "

On Wednesday, the former ""19 Kids and Counting"" stars' parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar released a statement on the family's website announcing that their son had entered a ""long-term treatment center,"" which they described as a ""a long journey toward wholeness and recovery."" We are so thankful for the outpouring of love, care and prayers for our family during this most difficult situation with Josh. As parents we are so deeply grieved by our son’s decisions and actions. His wrong choices have deeply hurt his precious wife and children and have negatively affected so many others. He has also brought great insult to the values and faith we hold dear. Yesterday Josh checked himself into a long-term treatment center. For him it will be a long journey toward wholeness and recovery. We pray that in this he comes to complete repentance and sincere change. In the meantime, we will be offering our love, care and devoted support to Anna and our grandchildren as she also receives counsel and help for her own heart and future. During this time we continue to look to God—He is our rock and comfort. We ask for your continued prayers for our entire family.""Coinciding with news that Josh is headed to rehab, In Touch also reported on Wednesday that Danica Dillon, an adult actress and stripper, claims she had sex with Josh on two occasions.Dillon, whom the magazine notes passed a polygraph test, says Josh first approached her at the Gold Club in Philadelphia where she was performing and paid $600 in private dances before inquiring how much it would be to spend the night with her. She says that he offered her a gift of $1,500 and claims that he was violent with her when they had sex, adding that they didn't use protection. Josh has repeatedly been in the headlines this year. Formerly the executive director of the conservative and anti-gay group Family Research Council Action, he was forced to resign from the position in May when he admitted that, as a teenager, he sexually molested five minor girls, including some of his sisters.

(RNS) A young Muslim woman has been elected as the head of the student arm of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel organization.Amna Farooqi, 21, a Pakistani-American and a senior at the University of Maryland, says she loves Israel, cares deeply about Palestinians and sees nothing contradictory in a Muslim advocating for the Jewish state.Growing up in a Muslim home in Potomac, Md., a suburb of Washington, D.C., with a heavily Jewish population, Farooqi said she took on her family’s sympathy for Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank. She also made many Jewish friends and grew comfortable in Jewish culture. She decided in college that she didn’t understand the Israeli viewpoint on the Palestinian crisis and immersed herself in Israel study courses, including a semester at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.Farooqi came to see Zionism, the idea that Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, as a universally applicable story.“I fell in love with Zionism because Zionism became about taking ownership over the story of one’s people,” she said in March. “It is about owning your future. How could I not respect that?”Elected president of J Street U on Sunday (Aug. 23), Farooqi is charged to advocate for Israel but takes the critical view of the Israeli occupation espoused by her group’s parent organization, J Street. The Washington-based lobbying group is considered a liberal alternative to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the more established lobby that takes a more hard-line stance toward Palestinians.During her one-year term, Farooqi said, she wants “to see American Jewish communal institutions become more active and transparent in supporting a two-state solution,” referring to the idea — widely supported by American Jews — that a Palestinian state should emerge alongside Israel. Farooqi said she is concerned that some groups that publicly support the two-state solution still invest in projects in Palestinian territories that compromise Palestinians’ rights.American Jewish communal leaders have generally expressed support for Farooqi.“We expect that she will lead J Street U in fulfilling its Zionist mission to be pro-Israel and pro-peace, as we would expect of any democratically elected president of J Street U,” said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the lobbying arm of the largest stream in American Judaism.Also on HuffPost:"

We have long known that the moon was once home to ""fire fountains,"" a type of volcanic eruption driven by rapidly expanding gas. Astronauts on the Apollo missions in the '70s found hardened beads of glass that were proof of these fiery geysers. But scientists were never quite sure exactly which volatile gas caused fountains -- until now.  A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Monday finds that carbon caused the moon eruptions when it mixed with oxygen to form expanding carbon monoxide gas.""The carbon is the one that is producing the large spectacle,"" Dr. Alberto Saal, associate professor of planetary sciences at Brown University and co-author of the new study, said in a statement. For the study, the researchers analyzed the glass beads collected during the Apollo missions and looked for any magma that might have been trapped inside them when they cooled. And -- voila -- the magma they found had traces of carbon monoxide in it.Since the researchers found much higher levels of carbon in the beads with trapped magma than in the moon's volcanic glass overall, they concluded that the carbon monoxide must have been responsible for the fire fountains, Space.com reported. The finding not only sheds new light on the moon's old fire fountains, but also serves as more evidence that our planet and its satellite have a lot in common. The amount of carbon detected in the beads was very similar to the amount found in volcanic rocks on Earth. This new study adds to previous findings that the moon may have formed out of leftover debris when Earth was hit by a Mars-sized object.""The volatile evidence suggests that either some of Earth’s volatiles survived that impact"" and helped create the moon, Saal said, ""or that volatiles were delivered to both the Earth and Moon at the same time from a common source — perhaps a bombardment of primitive meteorites.""For the full story of how Earth got its moon, check out the ""Talk Nerdy To Me"" episode below.

And -- voila -- the magma they found had traces of carbon monoxide in it.Since the researchers found much higher levels of carbon in the beads with trapped magma than in the moon's volcanic glass overall, they concluded that the carbon monoxide must have been responsible for the fire fountains, Space.com reported. The finding not only sheds new light on the moon's old fire fountains, but also serves as more evidence that our planet and its satellite have a lot in common. The amount of carbon detected in the beads was very similar to the amount found in volcanic rocks on Earth. This new study adds to previous findings that the moon may have formed out of leftover debris when Earth was hit by a Mars-sized object.""The volatile evidence suggests that either some of Earth’s volatiles survived that impact"" and helped create the moon, Saal said, ""or that volatiles were delivered to both the Earth and Moon at the same time from a common source — perhaps a bombardment of primitive meteorites.""For the full story of how Earth got its moon, check out the ""Talk Nerdy To Me"" episode below.

In a statement Tuesday, Napa Valley Wine Train CEO Anthony Giaccio said the company was “100 percent wrong in its handling of this issue,"" according to The Associated Press. ""We accept full responsibility for our failures and for the chain of events that led to this regrettable treatment of our guests,"" Giaccio said.Giaccio also said that he'll offer additional diversity training to his employees. He offered the women 50 free passes for a future train trip.The book club, however, was not impressed. ""You can apologize but you can't take away the experience we had,"" Lisa Renee Johnson, an outspoken member of the book club, told the Contra Costa Times. ""We were still marched down the aisle of the train car to waiting police officers. I'm still traumatized by the whole experience.""Eleven members of the Sisters on the Reading Edge book club -- all but one of whom are black -- were removed from a wine train on Saturday after other customers complained that they were making too much noise. The women felt they were singled out because of their race. Johnson told an employee that she and her friends were behaving just like any other group on the train. ""She said people were complaining and I said, 'Who’s complaining?' And she said, 'Well, people’s faces are uncomfortable,'"" Johnson told the Napa Valley Register. ""At that point, one passenger nearby said, 'Well, this is not a bar.' We reacted, 'Yes, it is a bar, a bar on wheels.'""Outrage spread on social media after the women shared their story.

15,TECH,"Microsoft's Vague New Privacy Terms, Explained",Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/microsofts-privacy-terms-explained_us_55db66e2e4b0a40aa3abb0c9,"You probably shouldn't pirate ""Halo"" anymore.",2015-08-25,"<p>""Halo 5: Guardians"" is an upcoming game from Microsoft that you likely won't be able to download and play illegally.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55db8aae1d00002f00145bae.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Microsoft isn't shedding much light on a controversial portion of its new Windows privacy terms that has people concerned about the company's power to snoop on their computers. The passage in question suggests the company can prevent users from accessing unauthorized programs they've downloaded on Windows 10 computers, and people aren't thrilled about it. On Aug. 14, Australia's PC & Tech Authority reported that an update to Microsoft's end user license agreement allows the company to ""disable any games you've pirated or devices you've unlawfully hacked."" In other words, if you illegally download a game or plug a counterfeit keyboard into your computer, Microsoft theoretically reserves the right to stop you from using them.Apparently, that was the last straw for individuals already concerned about privacy on Windows 10. On Saturday, TorrentFreak reported that some private communities centered on file-sharing via torrent are beginning to ban individuals who use Microsoft's new operating system. Torrents, which allow file-sharing between individuals on a massive scale, can be used for a variety of legal and not-so-legal purposes -- but the implication here is that pirates want to avoid detection by one of the most powerful technology corporations on the planet. As Ars Technica pointed out Monday, that's probably fine by Microsoft, which has continued to be vague when reached for comment about its terms.The relevant text exists in the Microsoft Services Agreement, a document that governs a variety of Microsoft products from Bing to Xbox Music Pass. Here's what Microsoft actually says (emphasis ours):Sometimes you’ll need software updates to keep using the Services. We may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices. You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply. Microsoft isn’t obligated to make any updates available and we don’t guarantee that we will support the version of the system for which you licensed the software.A spokesperson for Microsoft told The Huffington Post on Monday that while this specific agreement is new, the overall idea is the same as its ever been. Microsoft has long been able to do this.""The Microsoft Services Agreement allows Microsoft to change or discontinue certain apps or content where we deem your security is at risk,"" the spokesperson said.When HuffPost pushed back for more information, Microsoft simply reiterated the language quoted above in its Services Agreement. The spokesperson did not tell HuffPost what it means to ""change or discontinue certain apps,"" nor did it indicate if a user is able to disable this functionality. It's obvious why Microsoft wants to be vague: If users don't know exactly where they stand on pirated software, they're less likely to take a risk on it and might actually buy  the new ""Halo"" or whatever.Some users believe the agreement gives Microsoft the power to monitor any content on a computer running Windows or an Xbox console. Actually, the agreement's terms are more specific: They apply not to Windows 10 computers or Xbox consoles broadly, but to products like ""Office 365 Home"" and ""Xbox and Windows Games published by Microsoft."" The Windows 10 operating system itself has an additional layer of License Terms, which includes a clause about detecting pirated versions of Windows, but nowhere is it stated that Microsoft can detect that a program published by a third party was downloaded illegally.All this is to say: It appears Microsoft can detect when a pirated version of its own software is being used and might disable that program, but it isn't going to comb through every file stored on your computer to figure out if you paid for it all. That idea isn't new. People who downloaded bogus rips of Microsoft Word in my college dorm found that they couldn't use it when they shared a network with others who had identical versions of the software. Electronic Arts, a massive video game maker, uses authentication to ensure that people aren't uploading new games for the entire Internet to enjoy for free.So, rest easy: Microsoft, like almost any service you give any personal information to in this day and age, is definitely watching you, but it probably doesn't care that you're downloading eight seasons of ""The Big Bang Theory.""Probably."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speech in Seattle earlier this month may have represented a new high in tensions between the movements for economic equality and racial justice -- and a progressive coalition’s agenda for a Federal Reserve conference this week could offer a model of fusion for the two camps.The Fed Up campaign, a coalition of groups led by the nonprofit Center for Popular Democracy, will converge on Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this week to urge the Federal Reserve to be more responsive to the needs of American workers. In doing so, it will focus on both “economic and racial inequality,” campaign director Ady Barkan told reporters on a Monday press call previewing the campaign’s plans. The gathering is aimed at influencing Fed officials attending the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium.A major theme of Fed Up's parallel conference on Thursday and Friday will be “Whose Recovery,” based on the premise that the economic recovery has yet to reach many workers, particularly those of color. They note that the official African-American unemployment rate -- 9.1 percent -- is much higher than the 5.3 percent rate for the overall population.“Although there has been a strong recovery for Wall Street, that recovery has not reached Main Street,” Barkan said. At Jackson Hole, Barkan said, “We will be asking not only, ‘Whose recovery is this?’ but also, ‘Whose Federal Reserve is this?’” The Fed Up campaign’s immediate goal is to stop an interest rate hike that would slow economic growth, which it says would disproportionately hurt people of color. The Federal Reserve has indicated it will raise interest rates in September, though some economic analysts are speculating that Monday’s stock market slide and turmoil in emerging-market economies will give the central bank pause. Over the longer term, Fed Up hopes to reform the selection process for regional Federal Reserve bank presidents, which it believes currently reflects the interests of financial elites more than the broader public.(For more on the Fed Up campaign's efforts and the broader debate over monetary policy, head over here.)Fed Up will bring an estimated 50 low-income workers and representatives of communities of color from across the country to the Jackson Hole gathering -- an increase from the 10 activists it brought last year. “We see racial justice and racial economic equality as part of the same agenda,"" Barkan added, referencing the persistent racial disparity in employment. The campaign has reserved conference rooms where activists will hold “teach-ins” making the case for monetary policy that prioritizes full employment and wage growth, and plan to share their views in informal conversations with Fed officials and members of the media.The activists will also deliver to Fed officials an as-yet-undetermined number of petition signatures opposing an interest rate hike absent greater wage growth. Last year, Fed Up amassed 10,000 signatures for a similar petition, but this year it hopes to submit a much larger number thanks to the campaign’s collaboration with progressive online heavyweights CREDO Action, Daily Kos and Working Families Party, and a promotional video from popular liberal economist Robert Reich that has already been viewed over 150,000 times.Asked whether Fed Up planned any public and potentially disruptive protests at the Jackson Hole gathering, Barkan refused to disclose any specific plans, but did not rule them out either.While Fed Up since its inception has focused on the disproportionate impact of Federal Reserve interest rates on people of color, its events at Jackson Hole this year explicitly appeal to the themes of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has gained steam since last year’s conference. The campaign will host back-to-back teach-ins entitled “Do Black Lives Matter To The Federal Reserve?” on Thursday and Friday that Barkan said will explain how a “weak economy causes racial discrimination and disparities.” The sessions will be organized by activists from the St. Louis and Wichita, Kansas, metropolitan areas, many of whom have also been active in protests against police mistreatment of, and use of force against, black people. Barkan said that because Black Lives Matter is not a centralized movement, however, it has no formal affiliation with Fed Up. Dawn O’Neal and Keesha Moore, two African-American rank-and-file Fed Up activists who are attending the Jackson Hole gathering, shared their reasons for lobbying the Fed.O’Neal described the challenges of earning just $8.50 an hour as a teaching assistant for 3-year-old children in Dekalb County, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. Her husband is unemployed and stands in line at 5 a.m. every day for odd construction jobs at a local gathering point for day laborers. If her husband is lucky, he is one of 30 or 40 men among a group of 300 predominantly black men to be chosen for work that pays roughly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. They lack health insurance and must choose which bills to pay at the end of every month.“When the Fed says the economy is recovering, I do not see recovery in my community. I see the struggle of my neighbors, lines of people looking for work, people trying to make ends meet on McDonald’s salaries,” O’Neill said Monday on the press call. “I do not think those at the Fed know how life is here in South Dekalb county when they say the economy is recovering.” Moore, a 36-year-old single mother of four in Philadelphia, described her dogged and disheartening search for work after being laid off as a data entry specialist seven months ago. She lamented a Catch-22 of job hunting: Getting a good job often requires a car, and she will only be able to afford a car when she has a job.Moore suspects that being African American has impeded her job search. “They always ask me when I apply what my race is,” Moore said. “I am not quite sure what that has to do with getting a job.”Moore, like O’Neal, wants to tell the Fed about her community’s urgent need for more jobs and “fair” wages.Fed Up and its allies say even a modest interest rate hike will slow down a job market that is already inadequate for the size of the population and has yet to produce significant wage growth. That would disproportionately hurt people of color, who are already more likely to be out of work, and often experience discrimination in hiring that they are more likely to overcome in a high-demand economy supported by low interest rates.Proponents of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase, which include many Fed officials, center-right economists and politicians, argue that rates must rise to prevent excessive price and asset inflation. And some economists are also expressing concerns that prolonged low interest rates will limit the Fed’s ability to stimulate the economy by cutting rates if and when a significant slowdown occurs, The Wall Street Journal reported on August 17.The Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, which is hosting the Jackson Hole symposium that Fed Up is targeting, is aware of the planned counter-conference, Barkan said, but has not expressed opinions about it. Fed Up’s actions last year led to a meeting between activists and Kansas City Fed president Esther George.Barkan said that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart had expressed interest in attending Fed Up’s sessions.""President Lockhart’s first obligation is to the Kansas City Fed’s conference that he is in Jackson Hole to attend,"" Jean Tate, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta Fed, told HuffPost.
