The author stopped by HuffPost Live on Monday and dished on what it was like to call off her wedding five months before the Big Day.""I was surprised by how supportive everyone was,"" she said. ""I had one person who I spoke to that gave me the permission to call if off; a lot of people kept telling me, 'Oh that's normal, everybody has cold feet, everybody gets jitters,' and I was just so grateful that I had one of my best friends say, 'You know what, you can do it. Call it off; do what's right for you.'""According to Milford, there are some clear reasons people are hesitant to cancel their weddings, even when they know it's the best decision.""A lot of times, I think they think it's too late in the process and they don't have the guts to call it off,"" she said.

Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, was invited back to Queen Elizabeth II's summer castle last weekend, raising more than a few questions as to why the disgraced royal would be back in the monarch's good graces. Fergie was spotted leaving the Aberdeen airport en route to meet up with ex-husband Prince Andrew and her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, at Balmoral, where she stayed in the main castle for the first time since her 1996 divorce. ""It's just like old times. The duchess is being treated as if she and the duke were still married,"" a source told The Daily Express.So why is the queen finally warming up to Fergie? Royal gossipers might have you think that the olive branch has been extended in preparation for a wedding announcement from Beatrice, who has been dating boyfriend Dave Clark for six years. The pair were introduced by Prince William and have been pretty inseparable ever since, attending events together, hanging with celebrities and even hitting up the London night scene hand-in-hand.With the royal baby hullabaloo out of the way, perhaps a royal wedding is imminent. Beatrice just turned 25, and she's officially been pushed down the line of succession with the birth of Prince George. But will her mother be fully redeemed in time for the rumored nuptials? She was snubbed for William and Kate Middleton's big wedding day, after all. (Between the toe-sucking scandal and that whole bribe mess, we can see how it may be a little difficult for her in-laws to muster dinner party chit chat.) Alas, the queen knows when it's time to implement some decorum, so we have a feeling that there might be a sliver of truth to the latest wedding buzz. What do you make of Fergie's recent Balmoral stay? Do you hear wedding bells for Bea?Think we have another one on our hands?Want more?

Doug Downey, the co-author of the study and a professor of sociology at OSU, said in a press release that there is a palpable difference in the probability of divorce for children with siblings as opposed to children with no siblings.""When you compare children from large families to those with only one child, there is a meaningful gap in the probability of divorce,"" he said.The study looked at data from the General Social Survey, which interviewed 57,000 adults all over the country 28 different times between the years of 1972 and 2012. ""We found that the real story appears to be how family dynamics change incrementally with the addition of each sibling,"" said Donna Bobbitt-Zeher, co-author of the study and assistant professor of sociology at Ohio State's Marion campus. ""More siblings means more experience dealing with others, and that seems to provide additional help in dealing with a marriage relationship as an adult.""This is not the first study to look at the intersection of siblings and divorce. A recent study found that teens who have half-siblings with a different father are much more likely to experiment with drugs and sex before they reach the age of 15 than adolescents who only have full siblings.Click through the slideshow below to see even more fascinating divorce research.Keep in touch!

6,PARENTING,"Flips, Toronto Restaurant That Bans Strollers, Has Made Parents Very Angry",Mandy Velez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/toronto-restaurant-bans-strollers_us_5b9d6e89e4b03a1dcc87eac5,"Here in the U.S., different places have implemented solutions to keep strollers out of small spaces and for parents to stay",2013-08-13,"NEW YORK - APRIL 22: Strollers parked the launch of 'Sammy and Sue Go Green Too!' at Kidville on April 22, 2009 in New York City. (Photo by Roger Kisby/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6e893c000032000a2601.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hell hath no fury like parents scorned … over a stroller. Well, these parents at least.According to the Toronto Sun, Jason Desroches, Andrea Chilcott and their 16-month-old daughter were refused entry to Flips, an independent breakfast restaurant in Canada, because they had a stroller. Dad told the Sun that after speaking with a manager, he learned that the Flips' insurance policy doesn't allow stroller, because it's against fire code.""They didn’t present us with any alternative -- 'you have to leave' that's all,"" Desroches explained in an interview.The couple felt that the 17-year-old restaurant discriminated against them and other families with young children. However, one of the restaurant's managers, identified as only ""Bill"", told the Sun that the no-stroller rule comes from legal contractions, not discrimination. He said if someone were to trip over a stroller or skateboard the business could face a lawsuit.The couple is now boycotting the restaurant and planning a peaceful protest at the establishment.Click over to The Toronto Sun to read the full story.A Toronto human rights lawyer, Selwyn Pieters, told the Sun that although restaurants have the right to refuse service, denying someone service based on having a child in a stroller could be discrimination under the Ontario Human Rights Code. In other words, the couple may actually have an actual legal case. Yet, The Stir's Jeanne Sager thinks it's a load of you-know-what.“Strollers are nice. But they're not a basic human right,” she writes. “They have heard of babywearing, right?” Strollers aren’t a necessity like wheelchairs, which the restaurant does allow, she explains.And while this couple may not agree with Sager's resolution, stroller bans aren't exactly uncommon. Last October, a café in Europe went so far as to put up a stroller “blockade” to keep them out. Yes, that is a giant concrete pole in the doorway.Here in the U.S., different places have implemented solutions to keep strollers out of small spaces and for parents to stay happy at the same time. Disney World has designated ""stroller parking"" outside its tabletop dining areas as well as attractions. A county in Florida offers ""stroller"" permits for cars with young children to park close to their destination in parking lots. One Y.M.C.A in New York even has a stroller valet. So, while these Canadian parents can't have it all when it comes to strollers, at least they should be grateful for small favors -- they can have still take what's in the stroller out to eat. "
7,WELLNESS,How Much Do You Really Know About Antioxidants?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-are-antioxidants_us_5b9d6b7fe4b03a1dcc87cd03,More From Shape.com: 12 Surprising Sources of Antioxidants Top 10 Get-Gorgeous Foods Top 20 Artery-Cleansing Foods By Keri,2013-08-12,"Five fresh fruits and vegetables, part of the daily recommended healthy diet, held on the prongs of forks, on a white background.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6b7f25000033003673f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Keri Gans for Shape.comFor the last decade we have heard repeatedly how important antioxidants are for us, and every other day we learn about another new superfood claiming magical powers -- maybe because there seems to be always some emerging research in this field. But what's funny to me is that most people don't even know what an antioxidant is. More From Shape.com: 12 Surprising Sources of Antioxidants Top 10 Get-Gorgeous Foods Top 20 Artery-Cleansing FoodsAccording to a new survey for MonaVie, a nutritional products company, 92 percent of Americans cannot give an accurate description of an “antioxidant.” In addition, 91 percent cannot recognize one or more sources of foods rich in antioxidants, even though 75 percent of Americans say they try to eat foods full of this nutrient. So What Is An antioxidant? An antioxidant is a vitamin, mineral, or other nutrient that may protect and repair cells in the body against damage caused by free radicals. A free radical could occur for many reasons, including exposure to pollution, tobacco smoke, chemicals, or an unhealthy diet.Which Foods Are Rich In Them? Various antioxidants are found in a variety of foods. Here's just a few. Beta-carotene and other carotenoids: spinach, sweet potato, tomatoes, apricots, asparagus, beets, broccoli, cantaloupe, carrots, corn, kale, mangoes, peaches, pink grapefruit, pumpkin, squash Vitamin C: bell peppers (red, green, or yellow), strawberries, tomatoes, berries, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cantaloupe, cauliflower, grapefruit, honeydew, kale, nectarines, orange, papaya Vitamin E: broccoli, carrots, chard, red peppers, spinach, mustard and turnip greens, nuts, sunflower seeds Zinc: oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, seafood, whole grains, fortified cereals, dairy products Selenium: Brazil nuts, tuna, beef, poultry and fortified breads, other grain products What Are They Really Good For? With all the research to date, sometimes it does seem that antioxidants are good for everything including the kitchen sink. But from what I could find, most studies suggest that antioxidants can help reduce the risk for certain cancers and heart disease -- but even this is still not 100 percent conclusive. And specifically vitamins C and E, zinc, and beta-carotene may decrease the risk of age-related eye disease as well. As for fertility, a recent review published in the Cochrane Library found that antioxidants did not increase a women’s chance of conceiving or having a baby, whether she or her partner took the supplements.Bottom line: The thing to remember is that antioxidants are not a silver bullet to health. Loading up on supplements is not recommended and can actually be unsafe. However there really is no down side to including antioxidants in the form of a variety of fruits and vegetables in your daily diet, as they are high in fiber, low in calories and fat, and taste really, really good."
