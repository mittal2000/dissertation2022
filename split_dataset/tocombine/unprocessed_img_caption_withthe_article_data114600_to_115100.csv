Police said they're deciding whether to arrest an 80-year-old man who shot Miller while fleeing, unarmed despite her telling him she was pregnant. (AP PhotoLong Beach Police Department)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b9f63c00005b000af3c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Prosecutors Friday were waiting for the results of a police investigation into the killing of a burglar by an 80-year-old California homeowner who says he shot the woman in the back as she fled his home and ran down an alley, the district attorney's office said.Long Beach resident Tom Greer, 80, told KNBC-TV that the burglar had said she was pregnant and asked Greer not to fire, but he shot her twice in the back anyway.An autopsy later found that Andrea Miller, 28, was not pregnant, said coroner's spokesman Ed Winter.""Long Beach police are still investigating,"" said Sarah Ardalani, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. ""It's ongoing, and so we're waiting at this point.""Prosecutors filed murder, burglary, robbery and weapons charges against Gus Adams, 26, a suspected accomplice of Miller. He was being held on bail of more than $1 million.A court appearance initially set for Friday was rescheduled for next month.The murder charge is possible because Adams is accused of participating in a felony that led to a death, said Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell.Police said Friday that Adams' mother, Ruby Adams, also was involved, and she was arrested Thursday night on suspicion of robbery. They gave no details on her alleged role or the evidence against her.McDonnell said the homeowner came home around 9 p.m. Tuesday and surprised Adams and Miller, who were trying to break into a safe. They assaulted him, breaking his collarbone, before he was able to get a handgun, the chief said.Police said he fired shots inside and outside his house.Under California law, homeowners have a right to protect themselves with deadly force inside their homes and in the immediate vicinity — such as a patio — if they feel they are in imminent danger of great bodily injury or death, said Lawrence Rosenthal, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at Chapman University.But this case enters a gray area because Greer, by his own account, chased the burglars and fired at them outside his home as they were fleeing, Rosenthal said.""The problem here is that all this happens very fast and his legal right to use force probably ended just a few seconds before he did use deadly force,"" Rosenthal said. ""So the question is should you charge somebody on the basis of what really was a series of split-second decisions when he's just been robbed and physically assaulted?""McDonnell declined to say how many shots were fired or to confirm that Miller was shot in the back.No phone listing was available for Greer and he could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press."
2,POLITICS,There's a New World Superpower -- And 4 Other Things I Learned at Netroots Nation,"Ruairí McKiernan, ContributorSocial innovator, campaigner, and presidential appointee to Ir...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/five-things-i-learned-at-netroots-nation_b_5619021.html,"I had barely touched down in California when it was time to take off again.

This time, to Detroit, to attend Netroots Nation, billed as the United States' biggest annual gathering of progressive activists, organizers and online social justice innovators.My trip to the U.S from Ireland is thanks to a Fulbright fellowship that sees me based at the pioneering Citizen Engagement Lab in Berkeley. My research here looks at how we can collectively use the web to promote people power and build better democracies. I figured the trip to Netroots Nation was a must, something that could also help inform our work in establishing the Uplift campaigning organization in Ireland, which launches later this year.  So, with a guest ticket in my pocket (thanks Netroots!), I packed my bags and headed off to Detroit.Here are five things I learned at Netroots Nation.1. A new global superpower is being born. Everywhere I went at Netroots Nation were incredible movers, shakers and world changers. These are people who are mostly in their twenties and thirties and leading organizations with the power to engage and mobilize millions of people through sophisticated online campaigning and organizing. They are birthing a new world superpower -- a digitally facilitated citizen superpower that offers hope for people and planet. These groups are linking issues and allowing concerned citizens to join forces on issues that affect us all. They are harnessing the vast power of the web to promote real political reform, and improve women's rights, climate change action, immigration reform, Black, Asian and Latino rights, highlight corporate abuses, as well as championing other important causes. They include groups like the  Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Color of Change, 18 Million Rising, Sum of Us, Avaaz, 350.org, CREDO Action, UltraViolet, and members of  the OPEN (Online Progressive Engagement Network), who have over 10 million members in more than 10 countries worldwide. (See a more complete list of groups on my blog here).Such is their reach that no longer can these campaigners be dismissed as mere 'clicktivists' who don't know how to cut it in the real world of politics. These are serious players who know how to rapidly and cost effectively translate technological tools into funding, votes and lasting change. Groups like MoveOn helped elect Obama. Demand Progress was instrumental in stopping the regressive SOPA bill. 38 Degrees helped prevent Britain's forests from being sold and GetUp! made history by changing Australia's electoral enrollment laws. In India, Jhatkaa!, led by 26-year-old activist Deepa Gupta, is trailblazing a powerful movement that is pressuring the government to take action on issues like rape culture, police brutality, and the pollution of the Ganga river. The presence at Netroots Nation of numerous establishment politicians, including heavyweights like U.S Vice President Joe Biden and Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren, was testimony to the fact that these web activists have power, real power -- people power. 2. We need more soul.One of the highlights for many at the four day gathering was the keynote address by the firey Reverend Barber who brought the passion of his North Carolina based ""Moral Mondays"" movement to a crowd who often prefer their politics without spirituality. The Reverend injected life and soul into issues that all too often hang out in the realm of the intellect. He helped connect head and heart. He uplifted, shifted and got people affirming their huge potential to change the world. There was little or no talk of religion, just calls to unity, to love, to higher ground. Nor was this just some entertaining preacher pumping the masses with feel good endorphins. Barber was sharp, cutting and clinical in his deconstruction of the political and economic inequalities that dehumanize us all. He was strategic but soulfully so. He breathed life into what Gandhi referred to as Satyagraha, or soul force, and reminded activists and organizers that technology is great but it ain't nothing if it isn't fueled by hearts, minds, soul and spirit, all working together. Barber left the crowd electrified and ready for action. He concluded his speech by leading the crowd to stirringly chant ""forward together, not one step back, forward together, not one step back!""3. Detroit isn't giving up.  Detroit is a city that has lost more than 1 million of its residents (or half its population) over the past 60 years. The decline of American motor manufacturing meant the city lost its industrial base, resulting in urban decline and more recently bankruptcy. Everywhere you look in Detroit there are empty buildings, urban decay, and signs of poverty, particularly among the Black community who make up over 80 percent of the population. In total, 39 percent of Detroiters live below the poverty line.The strength of the motor lobby prevented Detroit from getting a public transportation system and it is claimed that all major national food chains have abandoned the city in recent years. Locals say racism and police brutality are widespread. Recently, thousands of residents have had their water supplies cut off, resulting in nurses referring to the situation as a public health emergency.But there's another side to the Detroit story. It is the story of courage, determination and the refusal to give up. Detroiters are fighting back and welcoming newcomers to come join them. There are now an estimated 1400 urban farms and gardens in Detroit and people are innovating and creating community based solutions for a city that understands the harsh truth of capitalism more than most.4. Taking it to the streets is still important. As I joined a water rights protest in the city, I tasted the magic of what happens when online activism converges with the tradition of ""taking it to the streets."" Here parents, nurses and union activists marched side by side with web warriors who published live social media updates and action calls that rippled out to the world's media and politicians. These updates bombarded local and state politicians and led to stories in the Washington Post and elsewhere. The pressure has since led to a temporary suspension of the cut-offs. While marching through Detroit's streets I was also reminded that while the web opens up the world to our campaigns, nothing can beat the energy injection of people coming together, face to face, side by side marching together, rising together. There is something about that deeper human connection that the web can't give us. It is something about seeing and feeling the power of community and having the realization that you are not alone in your worries, fears, hopes and dreams. The modern world brings great benefits but often keeps us separate, boxed away in cubicles and in cars, on phones and laptops. It has the allure of connectivity and freedom, but in many ways cultivates separation and loneliness. Merging internet savvy with human connection gives us the best of both worlds, and opens up doorways to deeper change.It can be easier to ignore emails than it is to ignore the sight and sounds of people demanding change. This is something Joe Biden knows. During his keynote speech, he was interrupted by the protests of young immigration campaigners from Presente and United We Dream who repeatedly chanted 'stop deporting our families'. It can't have been an easy decision for the campaigners to make the stand they did, especially with so many of the crowd enamored by the Vice President. Nonetheless they managed to hit home a harsh reality to not only the Vice President, but to the progressive community. They also succeeded in getting their plight covered in major news networks worldwide. The protests succeeded in reminding millions of people that immigration reform is a very real and urgent issue, particularly for the 11 million undocumented people in the U.S. Under the Obama-Biden administration, a staggering 2 million people have been deported. The protests were a poignant and strategic reminder that old school tactics might not always be polite or pretty, but they can be hugely effective. 5. The future is bright. At times it seems that the darkness of war, greed, injustice and prejudice is overwhelming. It is understandable why mental health problems are on the rise and why some people fall into the world of addiction, entertainment and endless consumption. ""Ignorance is bliss"" goes the saying, but it's not true. More people are waking up to this, realizing that collective action is the best medicine for despair. According to Reverend Barber, the slaves didn't know how they were going to free themselves, they just kept alive a vision of freedom, and so too must we. Netroots Nation gave me hope that we are more organized than we think, that we are more connected than we imagined, that we are creating a tipping point towards a better world. Let us keeping marching forward together -- not one step back.

4,POLITICS,Republicans Have Zero Reaction To Obama's Historic LGBT Order,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-boehner-gay-rights_n_5618954.html,,2014-07-26,"Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, talks with reporters about the border crisis, veterans' health care, and future funding, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, July 24, 2014. House Republicans and Senate Democrats are at an impasse on dealing with tens of thousands of young migrants showing up at the southern border, leaving any solution unclear with Congress' annual August recess looming. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d09a200000070201d11b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When President Barack Obama signed an executive order Monday making it illegal for federal contractors to fire or harass employees based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, civil rights advocates hailed the move as one of the most important actions ever taken by a president to stem discrimination.Democratic lawmakers raced to issue statements celebrating the advancement for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In addition to offering new protections for transgender federal employees, the executive order covers the broad federal contracting community -- some 24,000 companies employing 28 million workers, or about one-fifth of the nation's workforce.But in Republican quarters on Capitol Hill, it's as if nothing happened. GOP leaders have been silent. Socially conservative members have gone quiet.The Huffington Post searched the websites of the 18 congressional Republican backers of the proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- a companion bill to the executive order -- to see if any of them put out a statement. Only one did: Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who said he supports the policy behind the executive order because ""employees shouldn’t face unjust discrimination in the workplace simply because of their sexual orientation,"" though he raised concerns about the rights of religious employers.For all the LGBT rights advancements in recent years -- including the repeal of the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy; the Supreme Court's striking down the Defense of Marriage Act; and some 90 policy changes put into place by the Obama administration for federal employees -- the preferred response among congressional Republicans has been no response at all.Perhaps nobody better illustrated this point than House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). HuffPost asked him Thursday if he had any reaction to Obama's LGBT executive order.""Nope,"" Boehner said at his weekly briefing. ""The president signs a lot of executive orders.""Asked if he supports the principle of workplace protections being extended to LGBT employees, he punted again.""Listen, the president is going to make his decisions. He can,"" Boehner said.HuffPost reached out to some socially conservative groups -- Focus on the Family, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, the Family Research Council and the American Family Association -- to see if they were frustrated with the silence from their GOP allies on Capitol Hill. HuffPost also reached out to LGBT rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign and Americans for Workplace Opportunity, for their assessments. Most did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A spokeswoman for Focus on the Family declined to comment, but pointed to a colleague's recent blog post lamenting that the president of a Christian college has been ""bullied"" for urging Obama to let religiously affiliated institutions with federal contracts openly refuse to hire someone because he or she is LGBT.On the other side, Human Rights Campaign spokesman Fred Sainz said he considers Republicans' silence golden.""While I would far prefer they speak on behalf of the equality their constituents support, it's definitely evidence of our progress when some say nothing,"" Sainz said.One factor may be that Republicans simply aren't keeping up with the flurry of LGBT rights advancements. Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), one of the eight House GOP co-sponsors of ENDA, said Thursday that he didn't know about Obama's executive order. But he emphasized that if it has the same goal as ENDA -- which it does, except that ENDA has far broader implications -- he supports it. ""I co-sponsored ENDA because I think that should be the law for everyone,"" Grimm said.The Republican lawmaker shrugged when asked if he thinks it's hurting his party that so many are sitting on the sidelines amid a revolution in LGBT rights. He said he thinks his colleagues are coming around. Slowly.""Generally, I think our party is in transition,"" Grimm added. ""More people are starting to pay attention."""

Palestinians retrieved dozens of bodies from the rubble of Gaza homes during a brief truce in the fighting, raising to over 900 the overall death toll of Israel's onslaught on the territory since July 8, medics said. AFP PHOTO / MOHAMMED ABED (Photo credit should read MOHAMMED ABED/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b282400003200381b67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GAZA/JERUSALEM, July 26 (Reuters) - Palestinians in the Gaza Strip poured into the streets on Saturday to recover their dead and stock up on food supplies after a 12-hour humanitarian truce agreed by Israel and Hamas took hold on the 19th day of their conflict.Women in the northern town of Beit Hanoun wailed as medics pulled three dead relatives from a home struck overnight by an Israeli air strike, with hospital officials saying 85 bodies had been found after the guns fell silent at 8 a.m. (0500 GMT).Just before the truce started, 18 members of a single family, including five children, died in a strike near the southern town of Khan Younis, the Gaza Health Ministry said.Israel's military pledged to hold fire for 12 hours but said it would carry on searching for tunnels used by militants. The Islamist group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, said all Palestinian factions would abide by the brief truce.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been spearheading international efforts to end the fighting, in which 985 Palestinians, many of them civilians, have been killed. His diplomatic push was to continue on Saturday in Paris.French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said that the foreign ministers of all seven countries involved in the diplomacy -- the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Germany, Turkey and Qatar -- had called for an extension of the truce.""All of us call on the parties to extend the military ceasefire that is currently under way,"" Fabius said.WAR TOLLIsrael said two more of its soldiers were killed in pre-truce fighting in Gaza, bringing the army death toll to 37 as troops battled militants in the tiny Mediterranean enclave that is home to 1.8 million Palestinians.Two Israeli civilians and a Thai laborer have also been killed by rockets fired from Gaza. Israel launched its offensive on July 8, vowing to halt repeated rocket fire out of Gaza by Hamas militants who want to break a blockade of the territory.Stunned residents of Beit Hanoun wandered through destroyed streets lined with damaged houses or mounds of rubble where once whole buildings had stood. Some who had not seen each other for days embraced as they surveyed the wreckage around them.Many of Beit Hanoun's 30,000 residents had fled the area. ""We hope the calm lasts and they find a solution so fighting ends. We are afraid for our children's safety,"" she said, adding she will not leave her home. ""There is no place to go.""Israeli tanks stood by as people searched through the debris for their belongings, packing whatever they could, blankets, furniture and clothes into taxis, trucks, rickshaws and donkey carts before fleeing the town.Naser Tattar, director of Gaza's main Shifa hospital, said most of the bodies recovered on Saturday came from Beit Hanoun, Khan Younis and Shejaia -- a district east of Gaza City. Residents returning to that neighborhood found entire blocks flattened.Fighting continued until the truce took hold. Militants fired a barrage of rockets out of Gaza, triggering sirens across much of southern and central Israel. No injuries were reported and the Iron Dome interceptor system shot down some missiles.EID AL-FITRMinutes after the truce began, many Gaza residents rushed out of their homes and lined up outside banks to withdraw cash. Gaza City market was packed with people buying food and clothes for the coming Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr.""For us the Eid is going to be another day of war, another day of grief. I hope it all ends before we lose more people,"" said Shaima Mahmoud who was shopping with her four-year-old daughter for a holiday dress.Israel on Friday rejected international proposals for an extended ceasefire, a government source said. But Kerry said in Cairo that no formal proposals had yet been put forward.He said there were still disagreements on the terminology, but he was confident there was a framework that would ultimately succeed and that ""serious progress"" had been made, although there was more work to do.Israel's and Hamas's positions are still far apart.Hamas wants an end to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza before agreeing to halt hostilities. Israeli officials said any ceasefire must allow the military to carry on hunting down Hamas's tunnel network that criss-crosses the Gaza border.Israel says some of the tunnels reached into Israel and were meant to carry out attack on Israelis. Other underground passages serve as weapon caches and Hamas bunkers.Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said on Friday the military could widen its Gaza offensive.""You must be prepared for the possibility that we will soon instruct the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) to significantly expand the ground operation in Gaza,"" Yaalon was quoted by his office as telling Israeli troops at an Iron Dome battery.The Gaza turmoil has stoked tensions amongst Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.Medics said eight Palestinians were killed in incidents near the West Bank cities of Nablus and Hebron on Friday -- the sort of death toll reminiscent of previous uprisings against Israel's prolonged military rule there, which shows no sign of ending.On Thursday night, 10,000 demonstrators marched in solidarity with Gaza near the Palestinian administrative capital Ramallah.

Kennedy Airport July 22, 2014 in New York City. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has halted all flights from the U.S. to Tel Aviv, Israel following a rocket attack near Ben Gurion International Airport. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b0c230000380093d5b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The decision of the Federal Aviation Administration to resume US flights into Tel-Aviv airport was greeted with collective sighs of relief in Israel. But the sting of the ban still remains and points to the newly exercised reach of Hamas rockets, and their ability to seriously impact the lifestyles and bottom lines of Israelis. Hamas's political leader, Khalid Meshal, said at a press conference in Doha on Wednesday, that the rocket attacks that led to the flight cancellations were ""a siege in return for a siege,"" a taste of Israel's own medicine, and a highlighting the unfortunate double tragedy that Palestinian suffering only becomes a headline when the Israelis feel some pain too.Israel's transportation minister called the previous flight ban a ""prize to terror."" But it is unlikely than any Palestinians will shed tears over what had become an airport closure, since, for us, the airport might as well have never existed. It's very simple: Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip aren't allowed to use Israeli airports and we are not permitted to have any of our own. As a Palestinian living in the United States, every time I visit my family in Ramallah I fly into neighboring Jordan and drive two hours to get to the ""bridge,"" a tri-party international crossing point that encompasses a bureaucratic labyrinth of offices, checkpoints and security structures. First I pass through the Jordanian intelligence office, then load myself and my bags onto a bus that will cross three checkpoints until it finally gets to a bridge that crosses over the Jordan River. This would ostensibly bring us right into the West Bank, but in fact, Israel controls the border, so we have to unload from the bus, go through another bag check, security scan and passport control. When this is all finished we are loaded into yet a third bus and taken to the Palestinian side to do it all over again. This whole process takes anywhere from three to twelve hours, depending on capacity and the whims of the various security officers. If I had taken a flight straight from the US into Tel-Aviv airport, I would have been in Ramallah in less than an hour. And I know that because the last time I entered through Tel-Aviv I was with the press charter plane accompanying President Obama on his trip to the area last March. Even then, the travel office at the White House told me it took them a while to convince the Israelis to let me through. Travel restrictions imposed by Israel on Palestinians are at the heart of the current conflict. Through a system of military-imposed identity cards Israel has managed to divide Palestinians into four separate categories that are used to control where we can and cannot go. As a Palestinian from the West Bank I am prohibited from entering any part of Jerusalem, Israel or the Gaza Strip. In fact, I am not allowed to use many roads within the West Bank, since they are reserved exclusively for Israeli settlers. This summer I took my husband and my mother-in-law, Americans from Kansas with no connection to the region, to visit for the first time. With their American passports they were able to tour Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv and most of Israel. As a Palestinian whose grandfather was kicked out of what-is-now Israel in the 1948 war, I would need special permission from the Israeli military authorities to enter my ancestral land.For Palestinians in Gaza it's even worse: they can't enter Israel at all, nor can they go to Jerusalem or the West Bank. They must depend on the whims of the Egyptians if they wish to leave the Gaza Strip at all. Since the beginning of the year the border with Egypt has been open a total of 17 days. A Gazan with a visa to the US needs permission from Egypt to get to the States just as I, as a West Banker, need permission from Jordan.The occupation, which is enforced through a system of checkpoint and walls, affects the transpiration of people and of goods. But it has an even more dangerous consequence: It separates Palestinians from fellow Palestinians. As an example, I have not seen my aunts, uncles or cousins who live in Gaza in over 14 years. For Israelis, this period has been a difficult one, and a reminder that occupying another people can sometimes get in the way of summer plans. For Palestinians, however, it is just one more day under siege."

I could buy solid gold stilettos that a cross-dressing King Midas would lust over.Let's be honest for a moment. When it comes to the intricacies of fashion, we women dress for each other. Of course we want the boys to like (lust, adore, pine for) us, but there are very few men out there who know something fabulous when they see it. And when they do, we start feeling a little suspicious. This female flexing of physical dominance, which is usually manifested through clothes, is actually just one facet of a complicated intra-sexual competition between women. A Brief History of Psycho-sexual Competition  Charles Darwin -- circa the 1850s -- established the dominant theory surrounding intra-sexual competition, which basically means that members of a certain sex are vigorously vying for members of the opposite sex for ""reproductive rights."" While Darwin's theory largely focused on males battling for females, more modern evolutionary biology has since incorporated women into the intra-sexual competition fray.Among the dawn of big hair, ubiquitous denim and George Michael, the '80s also saw the dawn of a new psychology surrounding females openly competing for desirable male mates. American evolutionary psychologist David Buss broke intra-sexual competition into two fundamental categories -- self-promotion and competitor derogation.While men typically vie through socio-economic status, and of course physical dominance, women tend to highlight their youth, physical attractiveness and character strength. In short, men flex their money and muscles while women flaunt their bodies, style and more desirable disposition.According to Joyce Benenson (an associate of Harvard's Human Evolutionary Biology Department and a Psychology professor at Emmanuel College):From early childhood onwards, girls compete using strategies that minimize the risk of retaliation and reduce the strength of other girls. Girls' competitive strategies include avoiding direct interference with another girl's goals, disguising competition, competing overtly only from a position of high status in the community, enforcing equality within the female community and socially excluding other girls.Benenson explains that women's often surreptitious competition stems from very basic needs to protect our bodies, the archetypical vessel. Because we need to dominate other women while still maintaining a physical distance, our rivalry has evolved to be physical only in appearance, coupled with more cerebral control over others.She breaks it down into Three Main Characteristics of Female Competition:1. Women are basically hardwired to protect their bodies from physical harm to keep baby-making parts intact, healthy and without threat; ""veiled aggression"" has cropped up in the absence of physically attacking another woman. 2. Women who possess ""high status"" and ""high attraction"" (i.e. money, societal clout and beauty) don't need other women's support as much, and thus, are much less likely to invest in relationships with other women who only represent potential competition. A woman who tries to distinguish or promote herself inherently threatens other women and will often encounter hostility. 3. Women trying to guard themselves against potential competitors will often do so by means of ""social exclusion,"" which basically equates to glorified shit-talking. If you reduce the worth of another women in potential mates' eyes, it increases one's chances of snagging said male mate. How New-wave Feminism Has Complicated Things Even Further In the frothing wake of neo-feminist theory, the line between biological and sociological has grown ever blurrier; yes, we're all undeniably hot-blooded mammals simply vying for sex and resources, but our complicated social structure has impacted our inherent biology in profound ways. Feminist discourse posits the theory that many women have internalized what Karl Marx called ""false consciousness."" Marx's theory revolved around the notions of class; he argued that the dominant social class pitted members of the lower class against one another as the enemy, when in actuality, the dominant social class was actually the enemy.When this lens is repurposed for feminist purposes, female competition is not driven by ""biological imperative but social mechanisms."" According to this argument, cutthroat female competition is due mainly to the fact that women, born and raised in male-dominated society, internalize the male perspective (the ""male gaze"") and adopt it as their own. The male view of women as primarily sexual objects becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. As women come to consider being prized by men their ultimate source of strength, worth, achievement and identity, they are compelled to battle other women for the prize. -- Noam Shpancer, Psychology Today All in all, this paradigm is no damn good. We should try and be sisters, not saboteurs. This neo-middle school cruelty gives me heart palpitations. I can still hear the sweet thwack of snap bracelets on the cool girls'slender wrists. (Not to mention their lilting laughter as their budding breasts bounce down the hall to Home-Ec.) Sigh.We may scoff, smirk and sh*t talk the sexiest woman strutting down the street or slipping onto the nearest bar stool, but we're simultaneously taking silent inventory of what she's wearing and how she comports herself in the world. We want to destroy her and be her. If you haven't sniffed the bitter odor wafting through the air, it's irony.I guess all we can hope for is that by recognizing the strings -- both biological and sociological -- that tug daily upon our limbs and minds, we might grow increasingly aware of their pull and slowly deny them that power.But in the meantime, stay the hell away from my man."

I wish him well, but it's high time the Internet supported a group of savory snack food entrepreneurs with a viable plan for scaling up, and some surprising health and environmental benefits to offer their neighborhood and customers. A new pickle company has emerged in Philadelphia, going by the evocative name Gary Ducket, founded by five guys who love brine and sustainable farming practices. Pizza Brain co-owner Brian Dwyer is one of five partners in Gary Ducket, along with Larry Andersen, Josh Taylor, an international musician and film maker, Mike Wert, and Joel Evey, graphic designer at large, who's handling the mysterious and unforgettable branding for the company. Gary Ducket has already partnered with some top-drawer Philly restaurants and food purveyors, like Cheu Noodle Bar, Little Baby's Ice Cream, and the Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co., a Rittenhouse Square bar named after a front for a notorious Prohibition alcohol ring.Gary Ducket currently brines four varieties. Reggie Dill is a classic garlic dill pickle with vinegar brine, described as appealing to ""regular pickle folk,"" like me. Merky Mu$kit is a ""familiar, alien, sour dill funk pickle with lacto-ferment brine, for ferment enthusiasts and beer fans."" Scorpion $weet, not for the faint of heart or tastebud, is a Trinidadian scorpion pepper sweet hot pickle with vinegar brine, ""for heat-lust, masochists, perverts, etc."" (One wonders what the ""etc."" might indicate in this lively description.) And last but not least, the Bourbon County Gho$t, a ghost chili savory hot pickle with vinegar brine, which customers are advised to avoid putting ""in direct contact with children, pets or eye sockets."" Savory, spicy, or avoid-the-eye-sockets-spicy. You have options.Now that you're hungry, here's the really good part: the Gary Ducket folks care about the community in which they live and grow the food they produce, and their aim is to personally cultivate everything that goes into their jars. The team uses the method of Korean Natural Farming, which was developed by Master Han Kyu Cho in South Korea in the 1960s, and was introduced to Hawaii in 1999. Korean Natural Farming (KNF) advocates the use of self-sustaining, closed-loop systems which it creates by eliminating herbicides, pesticides, and synthetic nutrients. The health and fertility of the soil and all the benefits that go with it are KNF's top priority. All of this leads to robust crops and delicious food. Gary Ducket Korean Natural Farmspace in Kensington, Philadelphia, PAGary Ducket's yeoman farmers know all too well that most of Philadelphia's urban landscape is not an ideal setting in which to produce food, which makes their efforts on behalf of their own small but mighty farming operation all the more laudable. Through KNF practices, at least one corner of the city's land will be turned back into nutrient-rich soil which will help Gary Ducket produce the highest quality food they can in the middle of the neighborhood they love, ""repairing the soil,"" they say, ""instead of destroying it."" Some of the founders of Gary Ducket are even planning to become certified by studying with Master Cho at the Janong Natural Farming Research Institution in South Korea.Gary Ducket's Kickstarter page goes into even greater detail about the benefits of KNF, and includes lots of beguiling videos (one is narrated in Polish, in deference to Central Europe's venerable delicatessen culture) promoting the various pickles they make. Supporters at the $25 level and above will get their very own jar of Ducket pickles. But supporting this business has its own rewards: helping a small but vibrant neighborhood cultivate entrepreneurs and improve its ecosystem, deliciously and sustainably."

He is doing amazing and our family has learned the transformative power of change after spending the last five years responding to frequent change as a result of adjustments to schedules, vacations, medical considerations and activities that daddy could not attend because he had a dialysis appointment. Patrick's dialysis schedule was from 2:00-6:00 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. We have three children who were just 11-, 7- and 4-years-old when he started this therapy. As they grew so did the their extra-curricular activities and our need to constantly tweak and adjust our schedules to a new normal. My husband is an extreme contact dad and so he decided that being a classroom parent would compliment his morning schedule and allow him to be available for our children. Isn't he cool?We made a decision as a couple that for us to thrive as a family we had to learn how to embrace change. We never complained to our children about daddy's dialysis treatments and schedule because we chose to embrace it. As a result of our attitudes and decision to live our extraordinary lives our children never developed resentment or felt that daddy's evenings away were a bad thing. I'm writing this for any parent who might have to introduce change to their child or children and are struggling with where to begin. Our journey wasn't perfect but it certainly was resilient. I learned that my children never internalized that their dad was less available or sickly because he had kidney failure. My children saw therapy as a gift and whether we were traveling locally or internationally they saw that dad could always find a way to be healthy. They never interpreted any limitations on their dad or on what our family could do, be or have because of dialysis.If you a struggling with introducing change to your family here are a few things that I've learned over the years to move forward during changes in life:Set a date to move your change forward Nothing happens until you decide that you are willing to embrace and make a change in your life. Hope is not a strategy but taking action in the direction of the change that you desire will help you make progress toward your situation every time. In our case, Patrick made the decision to begin his dialysis treatment proactively.Ask for what you want and don't ask for what you don't want When moving in a new direction in your life, I want you to know that you are always in control of your choices. So many people respond to change as if they no longer have power over the decisions that they make in their lives and that is not true. We looked at the best possible options for treatment and ultimately decided on a 2:00-6:00 p.m. schedule because it allowed Patrick to have his days free for work and to drop the children off at school.Reach for the highest and best solution for yourself If you find that you never get what you want or that you it takes you a long time to obtain what you want to accomplish, I want you to look at the options that you are selecting for yourself. Are you choosing what is the best and highest solution for you? I want you to write down the five best scenarios for any situation that you want to change and rank them in order of your preference. Patrick consulted with his doctors about many different dialysis treatment options and did home dialysis for awhile because it was an option. This option gave us more flexibility and Patrick greater freedom for his therapy.Mentally adjust to the best option for you without consulting your ego How many times have you decided to make a decision because your ego told you, ""you need this, you deserve this, they need you, you should be able to...""? I know you can finish that sentence. When deciding on choosing what is best for you the solution will always bring you closer to peace, ease and joy. Period. If the options that you choose for yourself result in inner calamity and discord revisit your choices. We did what made the most sense for our family without guilt.Embrace your new path Different ways of doing things bring new insight, people and opportunities to personally grow. You can't celebrate what is in front of you if you aren't willing to embrace the goodness in front of you. I see people do this all the time when they move to a different neighborhood, change jobs, doctors or partners. They struggle to give their new experience a chance. They overplay the magic of the old relationships only remembering the good times and forgetting that it took time and commitment to make that journey great. If you decide to change directions, then embrace your new path wholeheartedly. At one point Patrick commuted for years to a medical team in Pennsylvania from Maryland for the type of medical support he needed. We embraced it and did not struggle with the commute.Change is emotional  The truth is that change brings out both good and bad crazy emotions in people. When you choose what is best for you, it might mean that it isn't what is best for someone else and as a result, they might not celebrate your choice publicly or privately. Patrick and I learned that you have to do what is right for you and your family. We always had great medical teams supporting his journey but we had to switch dialysis centers several times throughout the years based on what was best for us to give him what he truly needed to be healthy. It wasn't always popular but it was the right choice. Show Up and Play Full Out The day will come for you to fully show up and savor your new adventure. Arrive early and stay late so that you can learn about the new opportunity that is in front of you. Connect, network and learn how to make the most out of your new experience without fear. Just because it is unknown doesn't mean that bad things will follow. Trust and expect the best.We arrived at the hospital on March 12th early, eager and excited to learn about Patrick's and our family's new journey. He is doing amazing!"
17,HEALTHY LIVING,Am I Crazy For Getting a Puppy?,"Kipp Friedman, ContributorAuthor 'Barracuda in the Attic'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/am-i-crazy-for-getting-a-_b_5619468.html,"Yes, call me crazy but we are ready for a new pup in our life -- potty training, sleep deprivation and all.",2014-07-25,"two dogs, a yellow labrador retriever and a black labrador retriever, running on the beach against a blue sky",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e35d6250000320036c2c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In about two weeks we'll welcome a new addition to the family: a black Lab puppy. We've even picked out a name for him: Loki, after the Norse god of mischief.  Some people, however, think I'm the one who's loco.They tell me a puppy requires tons of work. That I should expect weeks of potty training. Sleepless nights. Soiled carpets. Ruined furniture. Some even liken it to having a baby. And what if the dog doesn't like me? Who needs that kind of tsuris, especially at age 53?  Dog people understand, though. They are quick to respond: ""Why wouldn't you get a puppy?""Here are just some of the reasons dog people cite for getting a dog:• Dogs can reduce stress, both at home and in the workplace; • They give us a reason for regular exercise through daily walks; • Dogs reduce loneliness and make you more social; • Perhaps most importantly, dogs provide unconditional love -- nothing makes a dog happier than making people happy.  I can deal with most things in life, providing they don't involve the harming of dogs. Tell me the lead actor dies at the end of the movie and I can cope with it. When Gwyneth Paltrow's head is literally handed over in a box at the end of Se7en, I shrug: ""Eh."" Klingons destroy an entire planet and its inhabitants in a Star Trek movie. No problem.  But I know I can never watch Sounder again because the family's beloved old coonhound is shot in the end. I well up when I recall how Odysseus's eternally faithful dog, Argos, instantly recognizes him after 20 years of struggling to return home to Ithaca in Homer's Odyssey.Like Odysseus, I too, am a dog lover.  In anticipation of Loki's arrival, my wife and I have been visiting a local dog park to get our daily fix of second-hand dog. The other day, Anne locked eyes with a yellow female Lab and the dog came over to say hello. The Lab then turned to me wagging its broom-like bushy tail, inviting me to rub its blocky shoulders, which, of course, I did, and then it walked away contented.My wife and I are convinced that this was a paranormal experience. It felt as though the spirit of our beloved late black Lab Berna was channeling to us through the yellow Lab. It was uncanny. There were dozens of other dogs chasing balls and Frisbees in the park, zipping by, oblivious to us. Only this lone yellow Lab decided to walk over. We just knew Berna was communicating to us from beyond the rainbow bridge. Anne got weepy. I know this sounds crazy, but dog lovers understandDog lovers will tell you that they enjoy the company of dogs as much, and often more than most humans. That while people will always disappoint, dogs will never let you down, except when their lives are over way too soon. Indeed, one dog lover's bumper sticker summed it up nicely: ""Who rescued who?""My wife thinks of Berna as the daughter we never had. We found her in 2002 at age two and a half through Midwest Labrador Retriever Rescue. She had already had a litter of puppies. We joked that she was a disgraced showgirl who got knocked up by the lead boy in her kennel and lost her girlish figure. When we first met her on a farm in southern Wisconsin, she charged out of her kennel with her siblings howling like a wolf in a pack. She came to a halt in front of Anne, gently bent a front paw, and stared into Anne's eyes and licked her on the nose. It was instant love. Berna fit into our busy lives without any problems. Our son, Max, would occasionally bristle when Anne would refer to Berna as his ""sister.""  ""She's a dog, Mom,"" he would say, rolling his eyes. But even Max knew it was a lost cause, rubbing his face against Berna's fuzzy muzzle. Berna slept in our bed most nights, her square head nestled under my wife's chin until her final day.  My feelings for Berna were so strong that I fainted moments after we had to put Berna down two days before Thanksgiving last year. Paramedics were called. I quickly recovered and was told there would be no charge for their visit. Weeks later, however, I received a $300 bill. I called the local fire department to dispute the bill. The fire chief was firm, but softened when I told him how I had passed out in the veterinarian's office after putting our dog to sleep.""Man. I didn't mind when my wife left me,"" said the sympathetic fire chief. ""But when my dog died I couldn't handle it."" Needless to say, he agreed to waive the fee.I have never grieved for anyone as much as I did for Berna. While we know we can never fully replace her, we are heartened that Loki is her great-great nephew -- the last of Berna's blood line.We plan to keep a dog cage next to our bed, but I know it's just a matter of time before my wife has Loki sleeping under her chin.Yes, call me crazy but we are ready for a new pup in our life -- potty training, sleep deprivation and all."

Simply put, it's the best visual to come out of the administration in months, maybe longer. (Full backstory on the photo and the visit to the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site here.) One thing this image highlights by contrast is how visually tired this White House has grown. (That's as compared to the Vatican, say, which is brimming with creative energy and a savvy for capturing the moment.)Our takes:• What's brilliant about the photo is how it plays the ""post-racial"" ideal against the reality of continuing racism and discrimination. On the one hand, the first black First Lady transcends the ""colored"" label the same way we, as a culture, identify segregation and this specific set of terms as well behind us. On the other hand, Michelle Obama has been the object of racial slurs, especially visually ones, from the first campaign onward. (You can Google it.) On that level, what the photo communicates, in no uncertain terms, is that this label is continuously hung over her head.• An extension of the last point, Michelle Obama has come a long way in her ability to establish her identity on her own terms. You recall the firestorm this caused because the Obamas weren't known well enough to make it obvious parody? The parallels to the photo above, are also interesting. Just add ""militant.""• From a purely personal standpoint, it's impressive how much power and presence Obama brings to the photo. The fact she's so much taller than the education director at the center; that she's dressed in all black; that she remains so receptive, listening that attentively as she also stands with her arms crossed, all conveys a deep assurance and personal authority. It requires that kind of presence to counterweigh those signs.• Certainly, this picture has plenty of power on its own. As a historical statement and a personal portrait, however, this photo makes a perfect bookend to the First Lady's very clever official portrait.
