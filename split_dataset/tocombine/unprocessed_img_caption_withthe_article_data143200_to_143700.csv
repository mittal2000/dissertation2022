Living in this beautiful house that we built, that took so long to build. Being in my art studio, painting. Packing my bags tomorrow to go home to Kauai where we have a house. Which all sounds very grand, and I suppose it is, in some respects, but nothing comes from nothing. It all comes from hard work. Being with my wife and children in Kauai, seeing old friends there, being on the beach, painting, paddleboarding. Sitting under a Kauai moon with a bonfire going, buddies around. Those are the things that kind of make my world turn.MP: Now I really want to fly to Hawaii and start a bonfire. That’s really going to make my day very difficult, thinking about that. So thank you for that. What does love mean to you?PB: PB: Love means that everything is right with the world. Love and only love. Love means that you are content within your own heart and in the presence of the person that you love, who fills your day and makes you stronger and wiser, and gives you the confidence to go out into the world. Love is just the most beautiful, joyous feeling. It can come from many places. Hopefully, the one who is beside you, the one who is there on the pillow beside you in the morning -- my wife. We’ve been together nineteen years, we’re celebrating our nineteenth year on April 4th. We’ve done a lot of life together. It’s been a great journey, a great road, and we still have lots of plans and desires and wants and wishes and plans. She’s my north star, somebody who has been a constant companion. And we seem to do well at being together and being in love and more importantly, liking each other. The like factor is a great thing. Love cannot burn constantly.It’s very hard for it to be so intense. But it’s wonderful. I tell her I love her everyday. It’s important to say that.MP: What makes you feel vulnerable in life?PB: Sickness of my family, sickness of friends. Sometimes the limited time you have. The news. Listening to the world, hearing the madness, seeing the madness of mankind and our leaders. The fragilities of our societies, the fragility of our ecosystem. The sheer shameful neglect of our leaders not to collectively get together and try to sort this planet out. China, North Korea. All of the above.MP: Are there causes or things happening on the planet that you’re sensitive to or you’re passionate  about? Organizations or causes that you’re behind?PB: On my website there are a number of organizations that I have supported, from the NRDC to Sea Shep to Jane Goodall to Save the Elephants. All of these players are significant human beings and organizations. The slaughter of the elephants -- it seems to have a dreadful inevitability to it, which is just absolutely shocking and appalling. You don’t see it on the news at night, you don’t hear the drum loudly enough through the static of other issues. So the demise of that creature will come with such a death knell, if we don’t really collectively pull together and try to stop the trade that’s going on and the slaughter for the Asian market. That has to be done through the young people, really, because those are the ones that will stand up and say, No, this is unacceptable.MP: Do you have a daily routine, a way that you keep your center and your balance?PB: Play tennis in the morning after dropping the boys at school. Then I go to the gym and I come home. Make a cup of coffee, go up to my studio, and paint for a while. Read scripts, answer phone calls, have lunch with Keely. Then I go back to the studio and paint for a while. Pick the boys up from school. That’s about it, really. It’s very simple. I live a very simple existence when I’m not on the road. Because when I’m on the road making a movie, I’m away from home. The next destination is Croatia. Last year I was in Sorrento, Mallorca, London, Tokyo. When I’m home, I’m home.MP: About the film, Love is All You Need -- is there something about it that you connect with on an emotional level?PB: It’s a movie about a woman with cancer. There’s a man who watched his wife suffer and endure the greatest emotional havoc and physical havoc from cancer. That leaves an indelible mark. So the film connected to me initially on that level, but it’s not all about that -- it’s about love. It’s about this woman who has breast cancer and is fighting the good fight with family, a son and daughter and a husband—who’s an idiot. The daughter’s getting married in Sorrento and she bumps into a very grouchy guy like me. They fall in love. It’s about a wedding, really. Susanne Bier directed it. She makes very intricate, complex, human stories. It’s like a Mama Mia! Luckily, I don’t sing. There’s no singing. The world is safe. You don’t have to endure my dulcet songs. But it’s a beautiful film. I love this film. It’s like a warm embrace. And so for any man or woman who is suffering through all of the onslaught of cancer or anything like that, this is a delightful film. It’s not sad, it’s joyous. It’s about family. And it looks ravishing!MP: I didn’t realize you were a painter. I financed this magazine through my artwork. What do you paint?PB: I paint in oils, I paint in acrylics. I paint figurative and landscape portraits. It’s all in my own kind of style. I’m self-taught. I was a commercial artist when I left school, but luckily I became an actor. I’ve painted for many, many years. Now the last few years it’s gotten more serious. Thinking about and hoping I will put on an exhibit and make a book shortly. Maybe next year.MP: Now he’s a painter, oh god. Put that on the list.PB: He paints like he sings and he acts like he sings. It’s all a game, Maranda. It’s all a game. The thing is to get away with it! Get away with it, great!MP: I have a PhD in getting away with it!PB: So there you go! Wonderful. Thank you so much.

The only problem? Apparently, nobody in Uzbekistan seems to know how 18-year-old Rakhima Ganieva won her crown.This is Uzbekistan's first year participating in the Miss World pageant, making it the third of former Soviet republics of Central Asia to be made eligible. In late July, the official website of Miss World announced Ganieva as the winner of the Miss Uzbekistan competition. It was reported that the self-described piano and travel enthusiast was crowned on July 20 in Uzbekistan's capital city, Tashkent. So why does it seem nobody in Tashkent knew about it? Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that its Uzbek services contacted the Uzbek Culture and Sports Ministry and the National Committee on Women, both of which said they were unaware that Ganieva had participated and that Uzbekistan even had a Miss Uzbekistan contestant competing in Miss World. Zhavlon Komolov, a representative of the Tashkent-based Pro Models modeling agency, noted that ""Rakhima Ganieva never passed through any special selection process in Uzbekistan.""According to Uzbek news site Mezon, the circumstances behind Miss Uzbekistan's crown are hazy. Mezon called all 10 modeling agencies in Tashkent and found that none knew who Ganieva was or had heard of a Miss Uzbekistan pageant occurring earlier that year. While local authorities were unaware that the event transpired, several United States pageant blogs publicized the results earlier in the summer. Beauty Pageant News described the contest as including ""national costumes, catwalk in cocktail dresses and catwalk and interview in evening dresses"" (although the webpage that listed that description has since been pulled down). The site said that the event was organized by Interalliance UZ and thanked Animesh Barua, national director of Miss World in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan for the information. Missosology, another pageant site, also publicized the results in its forum, saying, ""Thanks to Interalliance UZ for exclusive photos of Rakhima.""Which brings the mystery to Animesh Barua and his company, Interalliance KG, which has a ""Department of Models and Beauty"" branch  claiming to organize several different beauty contests including Miss Kyrgyzstan. The 2013 Miss Kyrgyzstan competition is publicized thoroughly on an official website. That site also posted several of Miss World's interview videos with other 2013 Miss World candidates, including one of the mystery candidate, Miss Uzbekistan. Interalliance KG makes no mention of an actual Miss Uzbekistan pageant, however, despite apparently distributing pictures of the purported winner on U.S. pageant blogs. In order for Miss Uzbekistan to have qualified for the contest, the ""preliminary"" round must have been approved by the Miss World pageant. The question remains, though: If there was a pageant, why does it seem to exist only in rumor?Miss Uzbekistan's Miss World introduction video, posted to MissWorld.org:A preview from last year's pageant: Want more?

(Photo by Harry How/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badefe82100003100c6ba85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This post is in partnership with TheShadowLeague.com.You remember: Barack Obama won the presidency, everyone was feeling all bloated with hope and the images of the Civil Rights era took on a shiny new hue, on the way from legend to prophecy. Eulogies for the recently deceased specter of racism met no sarcasm or derision; token blacks and browns everywhere suddenly, unimaginably belonged, like a stumble that becomes a part of a dance. We frolicked for a moment in the utopic playground of Post-Race America, where no one could see or respond to race because we were, you know, over it. But now we’re over being over it; Oscar Grant and Trayvon Martin have seen to that. We live in post-Post-Race-America, where we lie in wait for a chance to catch-a-racist-by-the-toe, knowing both intuitively and misguidedly that the best protection against being labeled a racist is to label somebody else a racist first. We do it well; we’ve read some books and we watch both Bill Maher and The Daily Show. We were ready for the Adventures of Oprah in Switzerland and we were ready to pull the race card on her race card when the saleslady cried foul.And we’re ready for someone like Colin Kaepernick, whose racial-cultural background has wound its way into more than a few compelling water-cooler chats. There are many reasons to talk about the 25-year-old starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers. First and least controversial among them is this Sunday’s much-anticipated game against the other half of the newest of the great football rivalries , the Seattle Seahawks. With an injury-free preseason and a Week 1 win safely behind him, Kaepernick is officially poised to dazzle both fans and fantasy-owners as he leads his Niners through the regular season. Amid breathless reports that San Francisco coaches have every reason to renegotiate Kaep’s contract at the start of the 2014 season, it’s finally time to find out if Colin Kaepernick can live up to the hype.And yet, somehow, that’s only half the story. Colin Kaepernick’s status as one of the NFL’s rising stars is due not just to the hype related to his potential as one of the league’s next best quarterbacks, but also to the gossipy phenomena that surround not Kaepernick the athlete, but Colin the man. As recent photo spreads on newsstands in GQ and ESPN Magazine’s Body Issue suggest (along with the resulting options you get when you Google “Colin Kaepernick Tumblr”), that man is the kind of man who has the kind of body women want to see more of. And as recent controversies in the media have shown, that body boasts the kinds of tattoos some people feel some type of way about .The beautiful thing about a Colin Kaepernick is that the attraction we feel as consumers to his celebrity gets complicated with the ways we see the world, ourselves and everyone else in it. Sometimes the thing everybody’s talking about is exactly the thing we need to talk about. But, when that thing is race, we seem to have a hard time getting beyond pointing fingers and isolating ourselves from people who don’t share our views.Especially in post-Post-Race-America.Stanford law professors Ralph Richard Banks and Richard Thompson Ford, writing about unconscious race bias, describe a shift after the Civil Rights Movement in which conscious race bias effectively moved underground, in step with an increasing “moral condemnation” of racist and prejudicial attitudes and behaviors. For me this connects to the failed state of Post-Race America. Failed because of what Banks and Ford’s work suggests, which is that the people who feel they have the most to lose from appearing biased will make a more conscious effort to hide it.And from what I can tell, the strain of that effort makes a jumpy trigger finger. When you see a racist around every corner, you might want to double-check to make sure you’re not in a hall of mirrors.In this climate, it should not be a surprise to discover that when people write about Kaepernick, they at least touch on, if not outright discuss, his racial identity. The public discourse of post-Post-Race America is a Wild West of sorts, complete with a land grab across a muddied plain, where everyone, regardless of race, is seeking to articulate some newly discovered ground, to stake a claim and announce to the world: “No, I’m the one who gets it!”And before you get all troll-y on me and start calling me names on Twitter, allow me to implicate myself: I am very well aware that I, too, suffer under the delusion that I have at least one finger—or maybe just a pinky toe—on the race-pulse of America.To get a better picture of post-Post-Race-America, let’s take a bird’s eye view of the controversy that started when Sporting News writer David Whitley wrote a column criticizing the omnipresence of black ink on Kaepernick’s body, on the grounds that it soils the image of the great American quarterback with a little too much of “Who’sWho on Cell-block Four.” From Whitley we get at least a clearly racially coded (of his own horror: “It’s not just a white thing, I hope”), if not actually (and perhaps accidentally) racist column. And then, as is natural in post-Post-Race America, the writers of Team Kaep’ weighed in to happily excoriate Whitley in the name of defending Kaepernick -as-magical-negro, displaying their newly acquired uber-progressive capacity to recognize and deconstruct undercover (and perhaps imagined) racist frameworks: “Why, some of his best children are black!” At least one Whitley defender chimes in, making the claim that Whitley suffers from age bias, not race bias, as if each of us is allowed just one bias per life and are perfectly fair and balanced in every other respect. There’s even a middle-of-the-road-er , who is ready to make a distinction between someone being a racist and someone like Whitley being racialized by his own experience and making comments that are both offensive and in line with integrity to that experience and the beliefs it yields.And so, our post-Post-Race-American landscape stretches out before us: Everyone agrees that there are ways to talk about race and ways not to. Everyone agrees that someone is doing a really bad job of talking about race, and perhaps even has the hubris to assume that they are doing a much better job.Is there a silver lining here? In an attempt to find one, I’d like to offer up a few observations: We are comfortable talking about conscious bias because it is never our own;e are comfortable talking about unconscious bias as long as we are certain it is not our own;e are ultimately unable to hide our unconscious bias because we are what we eat.And this is not a bad thing.Maybe one day, we’ll be able to turn to a friend after an awkwardly raced moment and simply say, like DJ Jay Smooth suggests, “ Hey, there’s something racist in your teeth,” and everything will still be copacetic.You know what? I’d like to propose a toast: to post-post-Post-Race-America, where we are now invited to freely move about the cabin and talk about race, to talk about what we see and even to talk about Colin Kaepernick, freely, without fear of rebuttal. Not because we don’t expect one, but because we don’t fear rebuttal. It’s where, instead of ending a conversation at agree-to-disagree, we might begin one. We are allowed to change our minds. Grow a little from time to time. Maybe even get to the bottom of it. A hall of mirrors is a pretty good place to begin the business of seeing yourself as you really are."

Though ""Naked"" has already nabbed a number of awards at film festivals in San Francisco, Palm Springs and Atlanta, the movie's starring foursome -- Ryan Vigilant, Karmine Alers, Lué McWilliams and Benjamin Weaver -- appeared particularly jubilant to present the film before an eager audience of Manhattanites on Sept. 12. (Check out the film's trailer above) ""This is the premiere I've been waiting for, because we all met in New York,"" said Vigilant, whose acting résumé includes stints on ""Gossip Girl"" and Lenox Avenue,"" among other roles. Noting that his ""Naked"" role was his first lead in a feature film, he added, ""It was a true test of my endurance. The movie was kind of born here, so it feels like a cap in a way."" ""Naked"" focuses on Laura (Alers) and Elliot (Vigilant), two siblings who return to their childhood home to re-connect with their ailing mother (McWilliams), who is in the final stages of terminal cancer. The pair is surprised to find that not only has Mom taken up smoking marijuana in addition to arts and crafts, she's also acquired a dashingly handsome new housekeeper, Ted (Weaver). Elliot quickly discovers that Ted's domestic talents aren't limited to the kitchen as the two men begin a smoldering affair, but his mysterious new beau has a hidden agenda of his own. Check out photos from the premiere of ""Naked As We Came,"" then scroll down to keep reading: Though the movie has received most of its acclaim on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) festival circuit, ""Naked As We Came"" has cinematic aims that go well beyond the sexuality of its principal characters, and refreshingly so. The film ultimately serves as a complex portrait of a tormented family finding strength and courage in what is unquestionably a tumultuous circumstance. The tension of the plot is juxtaposed against the backdrop of a pastoral New England estate, but each member of the ensemble cast turns in an equally solid performance, highlighting the subtle nuggets of humor in LeMay's script. The film was a very personal one for writer-director LeMay, who said he was inspired by several close friends who lost parents over the course of a year. ""I started thinking about what I would do if I knew one of parents was going to die,"" he said. ""It's a pretty dysfunctional family, but I think dysfunction can also be funny, if you stand back and let it be."" Noting this his aim was to ""make a movie that wasn't focused entirely on gay themes or gay issues,"" LeMay added, ""I don't think that [being gay] is the issue in this case; the issue is really just that they're human."" Weaver echoed those sentiments, noting, ""I think the message is about identifying what your real dream is, and having the courage to go after that, but also knowing that it's not always so easy to articulate that, and it might take some false starts before you figure it all out."" After its week-long theatrical run, ""Naked As We Came"" will be released on DVD in October. For more information, click here. "

In morning trading, U.S. stocks suffered a steep loss after news of Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc was selling itself to Bank of America Corp and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2fd93260000360081ffa4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Michael ErmanNEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - A few years ago, Larry Summers, then the director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, held a private meeting with some of Wall Street's top bankers and executives.Although the worst of the financial crisis was over by then, Summers - now seen as a candidate to be the next chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve - chastised bankers for being out of touch, saying they didn't understand how angry average Americans were with them, according to a participant in the meeting.A spokeswoman for Summers said it sounded like something he might have said, though she did not provide more specific confirmation.Five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and two years after the start of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Wall Street has drastically changed under an onslaught of new regulations and by some accounts become more conscious of its image on Main Street.Still, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Main Street animus against bankers and their role in the financial crisis persists. (Click on http://link.reuters.com/sud23v for the results)The anti-Wall Street sentiment bodes ill for the sector: It serves to pressure lawmakers and regulators into further restraining perceived excesses on Wall Street, threatening the long-term profitability of the industry. 'NOTHING'S REALLY CHANGED'The poll of more than 1,400 adults, representing a cross-section of the U.S. population, shows that half of the respondents believe there has not been enough reform to prevent a future crisis.As many as 44 percent of those polled believe the government should not have bailed out financial institutions, while only 22 percent thought it was the right move. Fifty-three percent think not enough was done to prosecute bankers; 15 percent were satisfied with the effort.Henry Paulson, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary who was the architect of the bailouts in 2008, said he believes the government botched its chance to portray them as a necessity for the financial stability of all Americans.""I never was able to convince the average American that what we did with these rescues wasn't for Wall Street but it was for them,"" Paulson said in an interview.""To understand the financial system, it's a little like plumbing in your house - you don't know where the pipes are and you just realize it when the pipes get clogged and everything grinds to a halt.""Among those polled, the concerns go deeper.""I can't see any reforms they've done. Nothing's really changed,"" said Judith Klatt, 67, a retiree from Wisconsin who responded to the survey. ""I'm angry at the government and Wall Street. I think they've both, in plain language, screwed the public and are still doing so."" A WORSE CRISIS FORESTALLEDMany financial experts believe bailouts of financial institutions after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and subsequent actions by the U.S. government to prop up the economy helped stop the country's spiral into what could have been a crisis even as dire as the Great Depression. New regulations, including the Dodd-Frank finance reform law and Basel III capital rules, have also forced Wall Street to rein in risky behavior.And while Wall Street gets poor scores on many questions, the results of the poll are not as damning as some polls about attitudes to Wall Street taken soon after the financial crisis.Lindsay Owens, a Stanford University doctoral student who has tracked American attitudes toward Wall Street, said animosity toward the financial sector reached its highest level in 40 years in 2010. When it declined slightly in 2012, the level was still higher than it had been in that period before the crisis, she said. (There is no direct previous comparison to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.)The cost of the crisis has been severe. A paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated that the financial crisis and the recession cost the U.S. economy as much as $14 trillion, or about $120,000 for every household.The recovery has also been slow, and high levels of unemployment have persisted. In September 2011, a groundswell of rage led to the creation of the Occupy movement and the concept of the 99 percent of people against the 1 percent of highest income earners, including bankers on Wall Street.""We have, on the one hand, the bankers and the lobbyists and the politicians that have been bought by those lobbyists and think that any regulation is too much regulation,"" said Cathy O'Neil, a former quantitative hedge-fund analyst who is the organizer of the Occupy Wall Street alternative-bank group, which wants to make the financial system more accountable and transparent.""On the other hand, we have the 99 percent who see it from a very different angle, and in particular don't see why we had to bail out the banks or any improvement to the system since then,"" said O'Neil.LESS PAY, MORE PUNISHMENTThe Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that as many as 30 percent of Americans believe Wall Street banks and traders do not help the economy grow and create jobs. (Twenty-six percent of those polled said they believed the financial services sector was good for the economy.)Fifty-one percent believe Silicon Valley and the technology industry do better than the financial services industry at creating jobs and helping the U.S. economy, while only 10 percent said they thought Wall Street did better.About one-third of those polled said breaking up the big banks will help the economy, nearly twice the number of people who thought it would hurt.A majority of those polled said Wall Street bankers, traders and executives were still paid too much. More than half also want the government to do more to punish those responsible for the crisis.""I haven't seen anybody prosecuted and joining Bernie Madoff in jail as a cell mate,"" said Francisco Ramos, 47, a Florida-based former land surveyor, in reference to the fraudster. Ramos, who was among those polled, said he wants to see bankers jailed ""just to scare them so they don't pull the same shenanigans again.""Barney Frank, who recently retired as the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said past convictions were an unfair standard to use when considering the government's success in reforming the financial sector.""People don't fully understand. One of the reasons we had to pass a lot of new laws is a lot of bad things weren't illegal. It will be fair to judge going forward,"" Frank said.Kenneth Feinberg, the so-called pay czar who was charged by the U.S. government with keeping bonuses in check at bailed-out firms after the crisis, agreed with the respondents that pay was still too high on Wall Street but said he didn't believe it was the government's job to regulate compensation.""American history teaches us that there's always been a wide chasm between Wall Street and Main Street,"" Feinberg said. ""I don't think anything that Wall Street can do will bridge that divide.""

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb36a0120000030000038ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Edward Snowden's unprecedented exposure of U.S. technology companies' close collaboration with national intelligence agencies, widely expected to damage the industry's financial performance abroad, may actually end up helping.Despite emphatic predictions of waning business prospects, some of the big Internet companies that the former National Security Agency contractor showed to be closely involved in gathering data on people overseas - such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. - say privately that they have felt little if any impact on their businesses.Insiders at companies that offer remote computing services known as cloud computing, including Amazon and Microsoft Corp, also say they are seeing no fallout.Meanwhile, smaller U.S. companies offering encryption and related security services are seeing a jump in business overseas, along with an uptick in sales domestically as individuals and companies work harder to protect secrets.""Our value proposition had been that it's a wild world out there, while doing business internationally you need to protect yourself,"" said Jon Callas, co-founder of phone and text encryption provider Silent Circle, where revenue quadrupled from May to June on a small base.""Now the message people are getting from the newspapers every day is that it's a wild world even domestically.""PROPHESIES OF DOOMShortly after Snowden's leaked documents detailed collaboration giving the NSA access to the accounts of tens of thousands of net companies' users, the big Internet companies and their allies issued dire warnings, predicting that American businesses would lose tens of billions of dollars in revenue abroad as distrustful customers seek out local alternatives.In a federal court filing last week, Google said that still-unfolding news coverage was causing ""substantial harm to Google's reputation and business"". The company said that could be mitigated if it were allowed to comment with precision about its intelligence dealings.Likewise, last month, six technology trade groups wrote to the White House to urge reforms in the spy programs, citing what it called a ""study"" predicting a $35 billion cumulative shortfall by 2016 in the vital economic sector.That number, it turns out, was extrapolated from a security trade group's survey of 207 non-U.S. members - and the group, the Cloud Security Alliance, had explicitly cautioned that its members weren't representative of the entire industry.""I know you want sectors and numbers, but I don't have it,"" said Ed Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, one of the trade groups behind the letter. ""Anybody who tells you they do is making it up.""The trade groups aren't the only ones issuing dismal, and headline-grabbing, forecasts.Forrester Research analyst James Staten wrote of the $35 billion figure: ""We think this estimate is too low and could be as high as $180 billion, or a 25 percent hit to overall IT service provider revenues.""Staten's comments generated dozens of media stories, some of which neglected to mention that Staten said the worst would come to pass only if businesses decided that spying was a bigger issue than the savings they gained from a shift to cloud computing.In an interview with Reuters, Staten said he didn't believe that would be the case. ""I don't think there's going to be a significant pullback,"" he said, though the rate of growth could slow for a couple of years.LITTLE IMPACTGoogle employees told Reuters that the company has seen no significant impact on its business, and a person briefed on Microsoft's business in Europe likewise said that company has had no issues. At Amazon, which was not named in Snowden's documents but is seen as a likely victim because it is a top provider of cloud computing services, a spokeswoman said global demand ""has never been greater.""In the more than three months since Snowden's revelations began, no publicly traded U.S. company has cited him in a securities filing, where they are required to report events that are material to their business.One reason that the prophecies of business doom are getting such a wide airing is that both the U.S. industry and its overseas detractors have been saying the same thing - that customers will stop buying from U.S. cloud companies.Politicians in Europe and Brazil have cited the Snowden documents in pushing for new privacy laws and standards for cloud contracts and in urging local companies to steer clear of U.S. vendors.""If European cloud customers cannot trust the U.S. government, then maybe they won't trust U.S. cloud providers either,"" European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes told The Guardian. ""If I am right, there are multibillion-euro consequences for American companies.""There have indeed been some contract cancellations.Charles Mount, chief executive of business file-sharing service OneHub, told Reuters that an automated system that asks customers why they have dropped the OneHub service elicited this reply from an unspecified Bertelsmann unit in Austria:""Headquarters is banning storage of company data in the U.S. or with U.S. companies altogether because of the NSA data-mining and industrial espionage. You should watch out for that. Maybe you should think about hosting in Iceland, Sweden or some other place known for complying with their own privacy legislation.""Bertelsmann spokesman Christian Steinhof said the company couldn't confirm that the exchange had occurred and therefore wouldn't comment.FEW GOOD ALTERNATIVESThere are multiple theories for why the business impact of the Snowden leaks has been so minimal.One is that cloud customers have few good alternatives, since U.S. companies have most of the market and switching costs money.Perhaps more convincing, Amazon, Microsoft and some others offer data centers in Europe with encryption that prevents significant hurdles to snooping by anyone including the service providers themselves and the U.S. agencies. Encryption, however, comes with drawbacks, making using the cloud more cumbersome.On Thursday, Brazil's president called for laws that would require local data centers for the likes of Google and Facebook. But former senior Google engineer Bill Coughran, now a partner at Sequoia Capital, said that even in the worst-case scenario, those companies would simply spend extra to manage more Balkanized systems.Another possibility is that tech-buying companies elsewhere believe that their own governments have scanning procedures that are every bit as invasive as the American programs.Some think it's just a matter of time, however, before U.S. industry suffers significantly.""Industry is still in denial,"" said Caspar Bowden, once the chief privacy officer at Microsoft and now an independent researcher and privacy advocate in Europe. ""It's like Wile E. Coyote running over the cliff, his legs are still turning but he hasn't started falling yet.""BOON FOR ENCRYPTION SECTORAs for the upside, so far only a minority of people and businesses are tackling encryption on their own or moving to privacy-protecting Web browsers, but encryption is expected to get easier with more new entrants. Snowden himself said that strong encryption, applied correctly, was still reliable, even though the NSA has cracked or circumvented most of the ordinary, built-in security around Web email and financial transactions.James Denaro, a patent attorney with security training in Washington, was already using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a complicated system for encrypting email, before the Snowden leaks. Afterward, he adopted phone and text encryption as well to protect client information.""One of the results we see from Snowden is an increased awareness across the board about the incredible cyber insecurity,"" Denaro said.Some early adopters of encryption have senior jobs inside companies, and they could bring their habits to the office and eventually change the technology habits of the whole workplace, in the same way that executive fondness for iPhones and iPads prompted more companies to allow them access to corporate networks.""Clients are now inquiring how they can protect their data overseas, what kinds of access the states might have and what controls or constraints they could put in with residency or encryption,"" said Gartner researcher Lawrence Pingree, formerly chief security architect at PeopleSoft, later bought by Oracle.Richard Stiennon, a security industry analyst and author, predicted that security spending will rise sharply.A week ago, Google said it had intensified encryption of internal data flows after learning about NSA practices from Snowden's files, and consultants are urging other big businesses to do the same.Stiennon said that after more companies encrypt, the NSA and other agencies will spend more to break through, accelerating a lucrative cycle.""They will start focusing on the encrypted data, because that's where all the good stuff is,"" Stiennon said.Already, in a fiscal 2013 federal budget request from the intelligence community published this month by the Washington Post, officials wrote that investing in ""groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities"" was a top priority.(Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Ken Wills)"

LynchWASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Twitter's use of a confidential initial public offering filing has reignited a debate about a 2012 U.S. law that critics say denies investors time to digest a company's financial information and erodes the widely-held value of market transparency.The social media giant can use the more secretive process thanks to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, which loosened a number of federal securities regulations in hopes of boosting capital raising, and thereby increasing job growth.It included a provision known as the IPO on-ramp that allowed ""emerging growth companies"" to keep draft filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under wraps while negotiations over the disclosures occur.Companies that don't meet the emerging growth criteria must release their IPO filings, usually with hundreds of pages of detail about their financial condition, risk factors and ownership and management structure, months before they sell their shares.This gives investors, financial analysts and journalists a lot longer to analyze the company's prospects.In the case of Twitter and other emerging growth companies, they can delay the release until 21 days before a roadshow to investors, which usually precedes the share sale by only a few days or weeks.They can also can disclose less information about pay for executives and directors, and gauge interest by sophisticated investors prior to filing IPO documents with the SEC.The law helps true startups test the regulatory process for an IPO without worrying about bad publicity if they decide to later withdraw their paperwork. It also allows companies to keep information from their rivals for longer.Some critics say it's absurd to lump a household name like Twitter in this category, even if it fits the technical definition of less than $1 billion in annual revenue.Its market value once listed is expected to be more than $10 billion.There is also an irony in Twitter, which freely spreads around vast amounts information in the blink of an eye, keeping its own details out of view. It announced its IPO plans in a bare-bones tweet late on Thursday.J. Edward Ketz, an accounting professor at Pennsylvania State University, said the idea of having a confidential filing process is ""dead wrong"".""It goes against everything the SEC is about,"" he said. ""The whole purpose of having the SEC in the first place is to get corporations to provide full and complete information about what they're doing.""Advocates of the JOBS Act say those arguments don't hold water.They contend that keeping private the initial discussions with regulators spares companies the heartburn of putting out financials and then being prevented from elaborating on them due to ""quiet period"" rules. Those rules prevent company executives from making public statements related to information in the filing.They note that 21 days before the roadshow provides plenty of time for public debate.Ketz said Twitter is not doing anything illegal or wrong, but said the decision is not encouraging for shareholders. ""If management at Twitter were more investor friendly, it seems they wouldn't invoke the option that they have.""Others disagree, including Kate Mitchell, who chaired the IPO Task Force, a private-sector group whose work advised the Treasury Department and lawmakers, including Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who helped draft the IPO on-ramp provision of the JOBS Act.She said that while the idea of a confidential IPO process ""sounds nefarious,"" it allows for the company and the SEC to have a generous discussion about proper disclosures and accounting methods.And it prevents companies from being put in the awkward position of putting out some business information to some potential investors and Wall Street analysts and then not being able to publicly discuss it.She pointed to the recent IPOs of Facebook and Groupon. Groupon in 2011 was plagued by questions about its reliance on what some considered to be unusual accounting practices. Facebook faced serious doubts last year after its IPO filing described its lack of mobile advertising as a risk factor.""All this hype was building around these offerings, and there was limited and static communications,"" said Mitchell, who is also a co-founder and partner at Scale Venture Partners.She also said potential investors get to look at all the SEC's red-line edits on the draft registration statements before the company goes public. SLEEPER LEGISLATIONThe JOBS Act was a rare bipartisan bill that sailed through Congress last year, even though Washington was generally gridlocked over budget and other domestic issues.The idea of fostering young companies at a time of sluggish economic growth had strong appeal, and those critics concerned about the erosion of investor protections were only able to make modest changes to the legislation.Besides allowing emerging growth companies to quietly navigate the IPO process, the bill also opened the door for hedge funds to advertise private securities deals and allowed for crowdfunding, a capital-raising strategy that lets investors take small stakes in private start-ups over the Internet.Overall, roughly 250 companies have used the confidential IPO process as of June 2013, according to the SEC, who will not name the firms.Among the known companies are some that are far cries from start-ups. English soccer powerhouse Manchester United last year used a confidential IPO to launch its offering in the United States after abandoning earlier attempts in Hong Kong, Singapore and the UK.The architects of the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate accountability law in late July mocked the notion that the soccer club is an emerging growth company that is going to help create jobs in the United States.""They've been emerging for 120 years,"" said former U.S. Representative Michael Oxley, drawing laughter from a conference crowd last year.Schumer, in a statement to Reuters, said the confidential filing provision has been one of the most successful parts of the JOBS Act. He said investors still have all the information they need to analyze well in advance of the IPO.""If Twitter meets the definition of an emerging growth company, they're free to avail themselves of the relief provided under the bill,"" Schumer said. INVESTOR PROTECTIONSEven early on, some questioned whether the definition of ""emerging growth company"" was too broad. Mary Schapiro, who headed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when the legislation was being debated, had tried to lower the $1 billion threshold but was not successful.In a March 2012 letter to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson and then-ranking Republican Richard Shelby, Schapiro said she recognized the importance of reducing IPO obstacles for small businesses, but was not sure the JOBS Act had found the best way.""A lower annual revenue threshold would pose less risk to investors and would more appropriately focus benefits provided by the new provisions on those smaller businesses that are the engine for growth for our economy,"" she said.Barbara Roper, the director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said Twitter's use of the confidential filing process undercuts the idea behind the JOBS Act.""It exposes the absurdity of the basic premise that this was about small company capital formation,"" she said."

""Oh boy,"" he said. ""Pack people in nice and tight, all screaming at about 115 decibels, and yeah, I could imagine peak sound might hit 132 decibels.""""I'm a football fan,"" Fligor added. ""But I'm not a big fan of that.""The current crowd noise record is 131.76 decibels, set at a Turkish soccer arena in 2011. At that level, people can suffer immediate and permanent hearing damage, Fligor and other experts warned. In a society filled with iPods, rock concerts, subways and battlefields, loud noise is often overlooked as an environmental health hazard, they said. Sporting events aren't typically high on the loud list, but Seahawks fans also don't see themselves as typical. CenturyLink Field has earned a reputation around the NFL for its opponent-distracting noise, a result of the stadium's acoustical design and the lungs of some 60,000 screaming fans, often known as the team's ""12th man.""The loudest official recording during a Seahawks game is 112 decibels. Fans and the organizing group of this Sunday's crowd roar, Volume 12, believe they have a good chance at the Guinness World Record.Joe Tafoya, co-owner of Volume 12 and a former Seahawks defensive end, is well acquainted with the Seattle stadium's noise. He recalled one particular moment during the 2005 NFC Championship game there -- a victory that led the team to its first Super Bowl.""I had to stop and look around the stadium in sheer amazement of the level of noise, the passion the fans were pouring into it,"" he said. ""That stuck with me.""The idea that such noise could be in any way a health risk never crossed his mind. But now, he said, he sees hearing loss as a ""public health issue.""In addition to going for the crowd roar record at this week's Seahawks match-up against the San Francisco 49ers, Volume 12 is working with Seattle's hearing-impaired community to raise awareness of noise-induced hearing loss. Volunteers will be handing out 30,000 ear plugs attached to informational cards to fans at the game.Standard foam ear plugs are designed to drop noise levels entering the ear by around 30 decibels, but that may not be enough to safely stifle the crowd noise on Sunday.""In the real world, it's probably more like 20 or 25 decibels,"" said Dr. Jay Rubinstein, director of the University of Washington's Virginia Merrill Bloedel Hearing Research Center. ""That would be adequate if you're trying to reduce levels that start at 100 or 110 decibels. If you're going to be around something noisier, you need a greater level of hearing protection.""Rubinstein noted that hearing loss is the result of both a sound's intensity and its duration. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration limits the amount of time a worker can be exposed to noise levels of 85 decibels and higher to 8 hours a day. For every additional 5 decibel increase, the maximum time is cut in half. At 115 decibels, for example, the limit is just 15 minutes.By the time noise levels reach 130 decibels, ""it's really unsafe to be listening to the noise for any period of time,"" said Troy Cascia, an audiologist at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.Of course, football fans aren't the only ones at risk of noise-induced hearing loss. Certain occupations can be dangerously loud, such as construction work and military service.One in three U.S. soldiers returning from the Middle East reports hearing loss, making it the most common injury sustained by troops -- ahead of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) is No. 2 on the list.Then there are those notoriously noisy rock concerts and iPod earphones. ""If you go to a concert one time, that's not a big deal. But if you go to three concerts a year from age 15 to 55, then your hearing when you're 55 may actually look more like the hearing of a 75-year-old,"" said Fligor, noting that just 4 percent of concert-goers wear earplugs. ""Without hearing protection, you've essentially prematurely aged your ear.""Some everyday exposures to noise are less avoidable, such as the passing of an express subway car or firetruck. In those cases, experts suggest sticking a finger in each ear may be the best defense.""We live in a noisy world,"" said Fligor, ""and we are living longer.""More years means more exposure, and a greater likelihood that earlier exposures will manifest as hearing damage. That damage can be subtle, such as a diminished ability for the ear to detect the high pitch notes of speech, said Cascia, who emphasized the importance of protecting children's hearing.
