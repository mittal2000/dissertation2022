Scott Walker's efforts to portray himself as the true small-government conservative in the Republican presidential primary could be complicated by his financing of major league sports inside his state. Party activists have criticized the governor for months over his support for a plan to devote hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to a new arena for the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks, echoing sports economists who have said it amounts to “sports extortion” -- the type of handout to special interests Walker decries on the stump.A lesser-known deal could further amplify the criticism that Walker is only comfortable spending taxpayer funds when it helps moneyed sports interests.In 1995, Walker also backed a plan to put taxpayer money toward a new stadium for baseball’s Milwaukee Brewers. Walker was a back-bench member of the state assembly when the then-owner of the Brewers, Bud Selig (who retired from his role as MLB commissioner in January), came to the state legislature looking for money to replace Milwaukee County Stadium. The plan lawmakers ultimately crafted and approved raised sales taxes by 0.1 percent on residents in five counties around Milwaukee. The newly created tax jurisdiction included Walker’s district.Walker voted in favor of the financing package that included the tax increase, according to Wisconsin legislative records. The tax is still in effect today.The stadium that would become Miller Park was controversial at the time. Statewide voters had already rejected a proposal to create a special lottery to fund the stadium and the tax increase led to the recall of state Sen. George Petak (R), who represented nearby Racine and cast the deciding vote to fund the project. The tax increase was scheduled to sunset in 2010. But even before the ballpark opened, cost increases caused analysts to extend it to 2014. At the start of 2015, the state still owed $195 million on Miller Park’s debt and last year, analysts estimated residents would need to keep paying the tax -- or find another source of revenue -- until 2020, if not longer. One local analysis found that the stadium had cost each household in the new tax district nearly $1,600.It has remained a source of controversy. In each of the last two legislative sessions, groups of lawmakers sought to end the tax increase. The Walker campaign did not respond to request for comment about the 1995 increase.Walker initially considered raising taxes on hotels and rental cars to help finance the new Bucks arena -- arguing, amid conservative criticism, that those increases did not amount to new taxes. Unlike the Brewers plan, the Bucks arena proposal, which state lawmakers have substantially modified since Walker introduced his original plan, does not involve direct tax increases on Wisconsinites. Instead, it uses state bonds and county funds to pay for part of the $500 million arena. Combined with the cost of property tax exemptions granted to the arena, taxpayers will pay for more than 80 percent of the project’s estimated cost, with the team and a former owner -- ex-Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) -- together paying the rest.The deal does, however, include a $4 million annual reduction in state contributions to Milwaukee County, which could potentially lead to future budget complications if the county cannot collect on unpaid debts to cover its losses. If past deals are any indication, those complications could result in additional tax increases or cuts to public services.Walker and the team have argued that a new arena will revitalize Milwaukee and have a major economic impact across the state. But research has shown that using taxpayer money to finance sports stadiums and arenas has little if any benefit for state and local economies. As the Brewers tax and other stadium deals have demonstrated, revenue projections often fall short and leave the public on the hook for even more than originally planned.The primary benefits of tax-financed sports stadiums instead go largely toward franchise owners who get a new stadium, revenue sources and often a sizable increase in the franchise’s value without taking on the project’s debt or financial risk.The Wisconsin state senate approved the Bucks arena deal last week. The state assembly is scheduled to take up the measure later this month. John Hammes, a member of the investment group that owns the Bucks, now serves as the Walker campaign’s fundraising chairman."

AFP PHOTO / ALBERTO PIZZOLI (Photo credit should read ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a7c67c1300002c00939e28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly half of Americans say they ""can't imagine"" life without their mobiles. Our devices have become extensions of ourselves, and while often a near-necessity (how would we get  anywhere without Google Maps?), they can also be more burdensome than functional.Excessive smartphone use takes us out of the present moment, but it's more than an annoying habit. Research has linked disproportionate smartphone use to anxiety, depression, stress and a lack of focus. There are still moments in our very digital age where it's appropriate to unplug and live undigitally. Setting tech boundaries is imperative to being in control of the phone, and not the other way around. Here are 12 times and places where it really is best to power down: 1. During a Broadway show.Because you really, really don't want to be this guy. Or this lady. 2. At home with your child. Lead by example and let your child know face-to-face conversation is the way to truly honor those around you.  3. When real life is cooler than screen life.Which is most of the time, really. 4. On the toilet (or in the shower).Sadly, most of us are guilty of texting on the toilet. Some studies have found that the average person's smartphone is actually germier than the toilet seat. But it's not just icky: Cases of people dropping their gadgets in the john have become increasingly common. To lower the risk of drowning your phone, keep it out of the washroom.  5. At the dog park.Your dog likes to explore and smell on her walk -- it's one of the the best parts of her day. If your head is down and your mind is distracted, you won't be able to notice her pace and body language. Make the walk around the block your bonding time -- she'll surely gift you with some extra happy wags. 6. During a meeting.Using your phone during a meeting isn't going to solve any inefficiencies. In fact, you and your colleagues are destined to get off track. Just feeling a buzz or hearing a beep can hamper your ability to focus, so it's best to keep your phone on vibrate, tucked away in your pocket. That dreaded meeting will be shorter and more productive.7. At a wedding ceremony.The couple has hired a photographer and your grainy smartphone photos are actually just making said photographer's job harder. Allow yourself to witness this special occasion tech-free -- and reminisce in a couple of weeks when the gorgeous, professional pictures are posted to Facebook.8. In a yoga class.There are so many benefits to yoga. The practice can clear your head, improve your sleep and present you with a new-found sense of gratitude. For one inward-turning hour, you're given the privilege of living in the present moment. And if not for your own benefit, switch to airplane mode out of respect for the other people in your class. No one wants to hear a Marimba ringtone during savasana.9. During a movie.There is no reason to pay $14 to see a flick in theaters if you're going to behave the same way you do when watching a movie in your living room on the couch. 10. In your car. Because in many states it's the law and because it's a terrible idea everywhere. 11. Under the covers. The only activities that should occur in your bed are sex and sleep. Make this a rule to live by and you'll snooze more soundly and improve your relationship. 12. During a Papal visitYou only get one chance to make a first impression. You get a lifetime to regret posing your gaudy pink cell phone case next to a respectable religious figure.  More on HuffPost:"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a708141200002b0013500c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"This story originally appeared in Capital & Main. Sign up for email alerts from Capital & Main.The 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) got underway in earnest Wednesday at San Diego’s Manchester Grand Hyatt resort hotel. The mood was convivial and the attire corporate casual: Brooks Brothers suits without ties, Dockers and sports shirts.Although this year’s star attractions — a GOP presidential frontrunner, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and a returning presidential contender, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee — weren’t scheduled to speak until Thursday, conference delegates had plenty to do yesterday.See more of Capital & Main's ongoing coverage of the ALEC Annual MeetingThe actual “dates” occur at meetings like those unfolding in San Diego — a council spokesperson said 1,300 conferees were in attendance — and take place behind locked doors, where the two groups hammer out the “model bills” that ALEC-member legislators then take home and introduce in their respective statehouses.The real work of drafting this year’s legislative agenda was mostly completed at ALEC’s May meeting in Savannah, Georgia. San Diego’s get-together is mostly a rubberstamping affair that presumably focuses more on implementation.Wednesday’s heavy lifting took place in the morning, in closed-to-the-public working groups and subcommittee meetings held in the Hyatt’s second-floor conference rooms. These focused on rolling out ALEC’s latest efforts at legislating away state public-sector pensions (through its Public Pension Working Group), diluting environmental health standards for things like greenhouse gas emissions and ground-level ozone levels (Environmental Health and Regulation Subcommittee Meeting) or deterring injured workers from filing workers’ compensation claims (Workers’ Compensation Joint Subcommittee Meeting). And that’s just to name a few.The tenor of those closed-door efforts could be grasped in the public afternoon seminars and policy workshops. On Wednesday, those included the conference’s packed opening luncheon, in which Iowa’s virulently anti-immigrant Republican Congressman, Steve King, introduced keynote speakers Clint Howard, the film actor andpolitically reactionary brother to liberal director Ron Howard, and West Virginia’s young solicitor general, Elbert Lin.Lin recently joined attorneys from 14 other states in federal court in an attempt to invalidate the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Clean Power Plan rule. That plan would require states to limit carbon emissions from the utility sector — currently the source of more than 30 percent of the U.S.’s carbon emissions.Lin denounced this “federal takeover of states’ energy economies,” which he termed “Orwellian.”“This isn’t something you’d expect, I think, from an environmental regulator,” he quipped. “Rather, I think it might be something that you would see from a central planning authority.” The room burst into applause.A later “policy workshop” titled, “Brave New World: Efficient and Cost Responsible Alternatives in Criminal Justice,” featured Copia Interactive vice president Aryeh Lightstone and for-profit bail industry lobbyist Nick Wachinski. The two were peddling a cyber-education literacy and vocational training scheme to legislators as a surefire cure for prison recidivism. Copia describes itself as “fully dedicated to the success of the K-12 schools, school districts, states and higher education institutions that we serve.”In addition to addresses by Walker and Huckabee (scheduled speaker Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz backed out at the last minute, citing senate business), Thursday’s agenda includes afternoon task forces on “communications and technology,” “civil justice,” “commerce, insurance and economic development” and “education and workforce development.” More: Labor Rally Sends ALEC Conference Into Lockdown Mode"

The 470-mile ride, featuring 8,500 cyclists, began July 19 and finishes July 25. Mara Gubuan, an Iowa native and founder of Muslim women's sports non-profit Shirzanan Global, said some women on the team only learned how to ride a bicycle recently, due to stigma in their home countries against women's participation in sports.The team is diverse. It includes an Afghan soccer player, a Pakistani swimmer, and an Iranian snowboarder, among others, according to Shirzanan's website. They ride from roughly 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Depending on their level of religious observance, many consolidate their five daily prayers into just one in the evening and maintain dietary restrictions by eating vegetarian meals.Gubuan is not Muslim herself, but said sports participation was a ""foundational"" experience of her own childhood -- and one that all women should have access to.In Saudi Arabia, women are banned from participating in sports in state schools. Those who do so outside of school are frequently viewed as immodest by religious clerics. In Afghanistan, a new women's cycling team is challenging cultural taboos that have kept women away from sports for years.""It can be considered immoral to ride a bicycle,"" Gubuan told The Huffington Post from a rest stop on the ride. The Muslim athletes on her team are women ""who have overcome gender barriers and cultural barriers to succeed.""Team member Raha Moharrak, the first Saudi woman to scale Mount Everest, told HuffPost Live's Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani that she learned how to ride a bike just a few months ago. She said she hopes her participation on Team Shirzanan will inspire Muslim girls around the world.""I never set out to be this role model,"" Moharrak said. ""But if living by example can show young girls all over the world, in general, and Muslim women in specific, that you are capable of doing what you set out to do -- whether it's climbing a mountain or riding a bicycle at my age -- then we have done a great thing.""Also on HuffPost:"

Kailen Young, 17, who works at a Hardee's franchise in Knoxville, Tennesee, was washing the windows of the restaurant earlier this month when he stopped to walk Bobbi Clare, an elderly woman, across the parking lot to her car, WBIR reported.  (Story continues below.) The act of kindness was spotted by David Yardley, a passerby who took a picture of the scene and posted it to the Hardee's Facebook page. It went viral with more than 16,000 likes and over 4,000 shares as of Thursday afternoon. But people on social media aren't the only ones touched by Young's actions.

At the end of the day, it was a young person having enough compassion to help to help an older person.""The onlooker told HuffPost that he has gotten messages from people as far as Singapore, expressing appreciation for Yardley's photo and Young's actions.The teen, on the other hand, thinks that what he did isn't anything out of the ordinary. ""Some people say they view it as rare, and I was surprised by that, because it's just a normal thing for me,"" Young told the WBIR. ""Going through reading the comments, it's been very humbling, very heartwarming.""Young's good deed did not go unappreciated. Hardee's rewarded the 17-year-old with a $1,000 check for his kindness.
