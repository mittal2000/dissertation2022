Alcohol, in turn, contributed to some 3.3 million deaths as of 2012.In some countries, consumption, and the resultant health problems attached to drinking, were worse. In 10 countries residents consumed more than 13 or more liters per person as of 2010. In Belarus, the heaviest drinking nation, residents consumed 17.5 liters on average. Based on figures from the WHO, these are the countries with the highest per capita consumption.Click here to see the heaviest drinking countries in the world.Nearly all of the countries with the highest levels of alcohol consumption are located in Eastern Europe. They include Russia and other former Soviet Union nations such as Belarus, Lithuania, Moldova, and Ukraine. The only top-consuming nation not located in Eastern Europe is Andorra, a principality located between France and Spain in the Pyrenees.According to Tom Donaldson, president of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS), historical and societal factors explain why certain countries have higher rates of consumption.Residents in many of these areas may also lack the information necessary to make informed health decisions, Donaldson added. “In some of those areas, there are no public health awareness efforts whatsoever about the effects of alcohol consumption.” Eight of the nations with the highest consumption did not have public policy initiatives to address the effects of alcohol consumption on the general public.Residents in these countries were also often among the most likely to suffer from alcohol use disorders. Five of the heaviest drinking countries also had among the 10 highest prevalences of alcohol use disorders. These include alcoholism and other forms of health-damaging use of alcohol. Such disorders lead to physical problems such as liver cirrhosis and mental illnesses such as depression. The three nations with the highest rates of alcohol use disorders, Hungary, Russia, and Belarus, were all among the 10 heaviest drinking nations.Of the 3.3 million alcohol related deaths worldwide, a third were caused by cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Unintentional injuries accounted for 17.1% of alcohol-related deaths. Various types of cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, and intentional self-harm were also common causes of deaths related to alcohol. In five of these nations, 30% of deaths in 2012 were alcohol related, compared to 5.9% of deaths worldwide.A number of serious diseases are largely caused by alcohol. Half of all deaths due to liver cirrhosis are attributable to alcohol. Similarly, more than one quarter of all cases of pancreatitis and various types of mouth cancer are attributable to alcohol use.Life expectancies in the nations with heavy alcohol use are also shorter. The average life expectancy at birth in high income nations was 79.3 years as of 2012, far higher than in almost all of the heaviest drinking nations. In Romania, the average life expectancy was just 68.7 years. In Russia and Ukraine the average life expectancy was below 72 years as well.While men in these countries drink much more than women, women in these countries are also heavy drinkers compared to women in other countries. The heaviest drinking countries overall include six nations where women consumed the most alcohol.Moreover, “Alcohol use among women has been increasing steadily in line with economic development and changing gender roles,” according to the WHO. This presents major health concerns for women who tend to be more vulnerable — physically and socially — to alcohol use.Women in these countries may also not be aware of the dangers of drinking during pregnancy and the health risks of alcohol on infants in utero. “There are no public health efforts to educate women on fetal alcohol syndrome,” Kathleen Mitchell, vice president and spokesperson for NOFAS said. “What it takes is a compilation of public health measures and awareness for people to change their behavior or take notice.”Based on figures from WHO’s recent “Global Report on Alcohol and Health 2014” 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the countries with the highest rates of alcohol consumption. Per capita consumption figures are based on a combination of average recorded consumption between 2008 and 2010, as well as unrecorded consumption estimates as of 2010. Figures on alcohol use disorders, which includes drinking behavior that can lead to health problems and alcoholism; heavy episodic drinking, or binge drinking; and data on the relative contribution of alcohol to mortality as of 2012 are also from the report. 24/7 Wall St. also obtained the most recently published data on GDP, unemployment, and inflation from the International Monetary Fund. Figures on life expectancies and poverty levels are from the World Bank and current as of 2012.These are the heaviest drinking countries in the world:"

3,WORLDPOST,Turkey Clamps Down On Mine Disaster Protests As Death Toll Reaches 301,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-mine-disaster-protests_n_5344039.html,,2014-05-17,"SOMA, TURKEY - MAY 17: Members of Progressive Lawyers Association who came to the city to give legal counsel to the victims' families were detained by the Turkish police in Soma, a district in Turkey's western province of Manisa May 17, 2014. Manisa Governorate has banned all demonstrations in the town. Rescue workers began to wind up their operation on Saturday after two more bodies, believed to be the last of the missing miners, were found bringing the death toll to 301, according to the Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz. (Photo by Ozgu Ozdemir/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc136722300005000d0ae27.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Humeyra PamukSOMA, Turkey, May 17 (Reuters) - Turkish police put the mining town of Soma on virtual lockdown on Saturday, setting up checkpoints and detaining dozens of people to enforce a ban on protests as rescue efforts following the country's worst industrial disaster ended.The last two bodies of workers thought still to have been left in the mine were carried out four days after a fire sent deadly carbon monoxide through it. That brought the death toll to 301, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.Hundreds of riot police patrolled the streets while others checked identity cards at three checkpoints on the approach road to Soma, a Reuters witness said. The local governor banned protests in response to clashes a day earlier between police and several thousand demonstrators.Eight lawyers from the Contemporary Jurists Association, including its leader, were handcuffed and detained during the lockdown on suspicion that they had gone to the town to take part in more protests, the private Dogan news agency reported.A total of 36 people were arrested and taken to a sports center in the town where they chanted: ""the pressure cannot intimidate us"", the agency said. The number of detentions could not immediately be confirmed.Tuesday's disaster has triggered protests across Turkey, aimed at mine owners accused of ignoring safety for profit, and at Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government, seen as too close to industry bosses and insensitive in its response.Erdogan has presided over a decade of rapid economic growthbut worker safety standards have failed to keep pace, leaving Turkey with one of the world's worst industrial accident records. The plant manager denied any negligence at the mine which was inspected by state officials every six months.Demonstrators clashed with police in the western port city of Izmir overnight, some setting up makeshift barricades and throwing stones and fireworks aimed at the police, Hurriyet newspaper reported. Some 40 people were detained.There were also protests in Istanbul. Some residents in the city banged pots and pans from their windows, an act which was a feature of last summer's nationwide anti-government unrest. ANGER AT ERDOGANThe police intervention in Soma could add to public anger towards Erdogan. He has survived mass demonstrations and a corruption probe into his government over the past year to remain Turkey's dominant politician, but now risks alienating conservative, working-class voters that form his party's base.There was wide media coverage of footage apparently showing Erdogan slapping a man as locals jeered his entourage when he visited Soma this week. The man, Taner Kurucan, said Erdogan had slapped him and told Kanal D TV he was then beaten by the prime minister's bodyguards.His adviser Yalcin Akdogan accused ""gang members"" of provoking Erdogan's team as he went to meet mourning families. Anger was intensified by a photograph of an Erdogan aide kicking a protester held down by police special forces.A group of students at the Istanbul Technical University occupied the mining faculty on Friday evening in protest at links between the university and the company which operates the mine - Soma Holding, the private Dogan news agency reported.They said they would continue their protest until various demands were met, including a guarantee that the university's links with the company were cut and the resignation of an academic there who said those who die from carbon monoxide poisoning ""died sweetly"". He has apologized for his comment.A university official said it had ended its ties with the owners of Soma Holding, meeting one of the students demands, Dogan reported.The mining company managers held a fractious news conference on Friday where they said an unexplained build-up of heat was thought to have led part of the mine to collapse, fanning a blaze which spread rapidly more than 2 km under the surface.Erdogan's opponents blame the government for privatizing leases at previously state-controlled mines, turning them over to politically connected businessmen who they say may have skimped on safety to maximize profit.Questioned on links between Soma Holding executives and Erdogan's ruling AK Party, a mine executive confirmed his wife was a local AK Party politician. Company chairman Alp Gurkan said he had never met the prime minister before this week.The AK Party said the formerly state-run mine at Soma, 480 km (300 miles) southwest of Istanbul, had been inspected 11 times over the past five years. It denied any suggestion of loopholes in mining safety regulations. (Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by Alison Williams)"
4,POLITICS,The Minimum Wage Isn't Just a Wage: It's a Standard,"Jared Bernstein, ContributorFmr.

A growing number of fast food workers in the United States have been staging protests outside restaurants, calling for a raise in wages, claiming it is impossible to live resonably while earning minimum wage. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c993260000300183b689.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've been doing a bit of historical research for a minimum wage paper and keep stumbling on these interesting and compelling ideas from the framers of that and similar policies (h/t: GL).Arguments about minimum wages tend to be about two things: will it hurt its intended recipients and the businesses that employ them by raising labor costs, and is it well targeted? These are, of course, important questions. But while they were certainly entertained by the framers of the national policy back in the 1930s, their motivation went beyond these narrow questions. They viewed the minimum wage as a new, national standard.Labor markets, like the broader economies in which they exist, are social and political constructs. They operate as much by laws, rules, and standards as by supply and demand. Laws against child labor, discrimination, overtime without extra pay, wage theft, and more are examples of hard fought standards that most Americans today recognize as integral to the functioning of labor markets.The minimum wage was conceived in this same spirit. Testifying before Congress in 1937, Isador Lubin, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, stressed that the minimum wage ""...aims to establish by law a plane of competition far above that which could be maintained in the absence of government edict. Other proponents argued that the policy would ""underpin the whole wage structure...at a point from which collective bargaining could take over.""Both Frances Perkins, FDR's labor secretary, and later Roosevelt himself spoke of putting ""a floor on wages and a ceiling on hours."" In this regard, we see that the framers had a very specific type of labor standard in mind, one that would block market outcomes widely perceived as market failures.It was not at all hard to imagine back then that left to its own devices, given the excess of supply over demand and the non-existent bargaining power of low-wage workers, the ""market"" could drive wage offers down to pennies and desperate workers would have no choice but to accept such offers. Through the Fair Labor Standards Act, which created the federal minimum wage, Congress acted to correct that failure (the act's objective was summarized as the ""elimination of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standards of living necessary for health, efficiency and well-being of workers"")To this day, advocates and analysts supportive of higher minimum wages remain motivated by these goals. Yet the debate rarely invokes labor standards, and instead exists almost exclusively on technical grounds involving employment and price ""elasticities"" (responses to increases in the wage) and targeting (whether the wage reaches low-wage workers in low-income households). This emphasis sucks important oxygen out of the room. Instead of placing the debate in the context of market failure, it becomes a debate about market efficiencies.No question, the failure of the low-wage labor market was far deeper in the 1930s than it is today -- that's one reason there's less urgency around these issues. And no question that market efficiencies must be considered.But while this isn't the Depression, there are still too many low-wage workers who can't make ends meet based what they're paid, and the research shows that moderate increases in the minimum wage have their intended effect without creating large or even moderate market distortions. Given those realities, it is essential to reintroduce the concept of labor standards to the minimum wage and similar debates. To abandon that fight is to accept the persistence of a sub-standard labor market.This post originally appeared at Jared Bernstein's On The Economy blog."

Meet five souls who rise above the masses. 5. Joe Putignano The man turned heads and generated applause at The Crystal Man in Cirque du Soleil's breathtaking ""Totem,"" but beyond the spotlights, lurked a dark, deeply disturbing personal tale, which Putignano brought to life in the book ""Acrobaddict,"" released last fall. The memoir is a fascinating, haunting and sobering chronicle of the gay athlete's vexing journey from the U.S. Olympic Training Center to homeless shelters to shooting heroin on the job. That it ventures beyond the athlete's addiction and illuminates the mood swings of the human spirit-- dogged, fragile, resilient, transformative and back again--is a triumph. It's a memoir for our time in that it shows how anybody has the ability to move through their darkest moments and find the light again. Good news: Putignano continues to generate buzz for his efforts--interviews with CNN's Anderson Cooper and The Advocate stand out. But this fall, the athlete takes his message further when he will speak to junior high, high school and college students, zeroing in on the subjects of bullying, drug addiction and following one's passion and life purpose. ""I wanted to talk to students because of this massive resurgence in opiate addiction, which seems to begin with prescription drugs,"" he says. ""I have a very similar story because I started taking prescription drugs, which ultimately lead me to intravenous heroin addiction. ""When I was in high school, we had a guest speaker talk about addiction,"" he adds. ""His story was gruesome and terrifying, however, it was filled with a lot of scare tactics. I don't believe scare tactics work to well with teenagers, because they are in a place of experimentation. Many of them think, as I once did, 'it won't happen to me, and I have a friend who did, and they are fine.' Not everyone that takes drugs becomes an addict, but when someone begins taking a physically addictive drug (such as opiate prescription drugs) they will become physically addicted, regardless of their willpower.""4. Mark Wolynn  Forget everything you may know and believe about traditional therapy. Calm down. it still transforms, but hang with me here for a second, folks and turn your attention to Family Constellation work. Haven't heard about it? Make a mental note. Better yet, check it out here. And then consider checking out a workshop. Why? Well, just breathe and keep reading because I'm going ask you something that requires you to be honest: Take a look at your life. What do you see there? How are you feeling? What feelings continue to emerge? What patterns of behavior repeat themselves on endless loops? Family Constellation attempts to illuminate previously unrecognized systemic dynamics that span multiple generations and the intent is the help resolve the lingering effects of all of that by encouraging the subject to accept the factual reality of the past. How that happens is unique and is facilitated in a group setting, and that's where Wolynn comes in. He's the director of The Family Constellation Institute, The Hellinger Institute of Northern California and co-director of the Hellinger Learning Center in New York City. His work in inherited family trauma is now revered. ""Just as we inherit our eye color and blood type, we also inherit the residue from traumatic events that have taken place in our family,"" Wolynn writes. ""While our physical traits are easily discernible, this emotional legacy is often hidden from us. Anxiety, fear, financial worries, depression, illness and unhappy relationships can all be forms of our unconscious inheritance."" Another notable: Wolynn's upcoming book, ""The Secret Language of Fear: What Our Words Reveal and How They Help Us Heal."" Keep your eye on this one.3. James Fox Yoga and prison aren't typically two words you would find in the same sentence together, but thanks to James Fox, that is changing. Fox is the founder and director of Prison Yoga Project, the unique program at San Quentin, which has introduced hundreds of prisoners--from those serving life sentences to those who have been released from prison--to the spiritual pow of yoga and meditation. ""The highest level of emotional intelligence or emotional literacy is sensate, getting past your mind and relying on your senses to tell you what's going on in your body,"" Fox writes. In other words: using that wonderful vessel we call the body to teach the mind. (Yeah, that thing!) In essence, Fox's practice introduces prisoners to skills to become more sensitive to how they actual feel in their bodies in an effort to gain a close relationship with, as he puts it, your own sensitivity. That way, ""you are less apt to violate another-- this is empathy."" And this is good. In reaching out to prisoners, Fox has created a stellar objective: to provide mindfulness tools so that they can use their yoga practice when they're not doing yoga. (Which is when most of the ""yoga"" is put into practice, actually.) The way Fox sees it, the practice may assist in life off the matt--anything from confrontations on the yard--and even upon release--and not giving in to the temptation to go back to using drugs perhaps. These souls can draw upon what they have learned from yoga for practical solutions--moving through the world or a situation without actually having to do a yoga pose to get the value. Says Fox: ""That's the transformational, rehabilitative value of yoga.""2. India's Crown Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil Being a prince is one thing. Being a divorced prince in India certainly makes somebody stand out. But being an openly gay prince in India? Is it just me or is there a major motion picture waiting to come out of this? (Somebody needs to arrange a pitch meeting!) Manvendra Singh Gohil is the only known person of royal lineage in modern India to have publicly revealed he is gay. When he did, heads turned. Eyebrows furrowed, especially among people in and from his own country. After spending several years speaking up and, in a sense, out, about his personal journey--the fortysomething was recently honored at the GMCLA Voice Awards for his courage of living as an openly gay man and founding the Lakshya Trust, which offers education and AIDS awareness--the prince is about to head into new territory. On Aug. 15, India's Independence Day, he will officially launch a bold new campaign: Free Gay India. Talk about a game-changer. Stay tuned for more details on that but in the meantime, look for a flurry of hashtagging and Tweets (#freegayindia, @FreeGayIndia) and other studly Social Media (facebook.com/FreeGayIndia). In an era where some freedoms are still being fought hard to attain, it's refreshing to find yet another courageous human whose valiant spirit shows us all that, despite all the odds, a sea change can actually happen.1. John Amaral There are people that move you. There are people that inspire you. But rarely do we find a beast that can combine the two and through their life work, have the ability to help transform you and, in some respect, the others around you. It's a safe bet to place John Amaral on the top of that short list. Like personal growth icons Tony Robbins, Kyle Cease, Barbara DeAngelis and human evolution and personal systems developer Dr. Donny Epstein before him, the Soquel, California-based, self-described edge-junkie and Network Spinal Analysis (NSA) practitioner is taking his work in the fields of Somato Respiratory Integration and NSA to a broader audience and thrusting it onto a platform from which individuals can play bigger, transform their own lives and--this is good--the world around them.Enter Body Centered Leadership. Amaral just launched the absorbing year-long project, which revolves around a series of workshops that steers individuals to connect to their greatness. At first glance, the project appears to showcase more clearly just how greatness requires, as Amaral notes, one ""to be energized, resourced and connected enough to overcome comfort and familiarity in an effort to master the art of living an energy-rich life.""The program delivers four immersion events throughout the year, which includes such things as NSA but much more. Special guest speakers/transformers/facilitators are also tapped to be part of the events, which are typically longer weekend affairs designed to allow attendees to ""upgrade"" their personal software, for lack of a better phrase.""When I first got the iPhone 5, I didn't realize that you had to shut down apps every time you used it, so I had like 17 apps running,"" Amaral reflects. ""And I was wondering why my battery was running out so quickly. And what most people don't realize is that they have all these apps running in their body; that physiologically they are hooked into a lot of stuff they have opened and haven't resolved, or haven't opened yet and they are concerned about. So that there's all these apps running in a system and it's a hardware thing in the brain and nervous system. What we are doing is clearing out the recycling bin, shutting down all the apps you have running and just preparing you to be in the moment and what's going on right now.""Amaral was first introduced to NSA and Somato Respiratory Integration 20 years ago. He launched his own practice, The Well Being Center, in Soquel, California, during the last decade and the practice evolved. He enjoys a steady clientele but wanted to do more; go farther.""I realized that people were really good at taking care of their bodies on a fitness/performance level,"" he says of the impetus to launch Body Centered Leadership. ""They eat well in the realm of fitness and nutrition, and maybe Piiates, yoga, or meditation ... and even with all of those things, I noticed that there was a big gap between people's awareness about what was going on emotionally in their consciousness, in their minds and how it was related to their bodies.""Amaral also noticed that people were taking care of their bodies as more of a mechanical thing they had to do to keep the vehicle moving and working. ""The other things that were present--thoughts, spiritual practices and anything to do with the mind seemed to be done as a separate thing. And so that there was a big need to help people understand to use the body in a way to help make them make that link in a way that was more integrated... way and feel good.""Body Centered Leadership's tagline sums up nicely: ""One part life-hacking, one-part personal growth and one part world-class mastermind."" As for Amaral, he just entered a new realm with his work. He's certainly one to watch."

(Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images for WIRED)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5bc8c200000e50000db02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The abrupt firing of Jill Abramson, The New York Times' executive editor, has sent waves throughout the media world, with pundits scrambling to uncover what motivated it and asking what comes next for one of journalism's most powerful women.  It is not, however, the first time the twists and turns of Abramson's career have grabbed headlines. In 2011, not long after she accepted the executive editor role, Abramson published a book -- not an in-depth investigation into some aspect of politics or current affairs, but an ode to her new golden retriever puppy, Scout. That the first woman to ever hold the Times' top job chose to write about something so seemingly far afield was the subject of much criticism, a fact Abramson acknowledged outright in ""The Puppy Diaries.""   The book is a sweet look at Abramson’s love for her dog, and a deeply personal account of how a new pet changes a life. But it also contains a great deal of wisdom that goes well beyond the ups and downs of pet ownership –- insights about loss, acceptance, trust and love, and especially the potential for an outside interest to enrich every aspect of our lives, including our careers, in unexpected ways.  Being publicly fired from a high-profile job and losing a pet aren’t exactly identical experiences, but for those in the media and beyond wondering what Abramson’s next chapter will be, there’s probably no better time than now to revisit her book. Here are seven lessons from ""The Puppy Diaries"" about resilience, joy, and finding meaning in life’s twists and turns.  1. Death –- even of a beloved pet -- shakes us from our routines. After Buddy, Abramson's 14-year-old ""stone-deaf, feisty-to-the-end West Highland white terrier"" died, she was ""disconsolate."" ""It wasn't simply that I missed the unconditional love or the ecstatic greeting each time I walked in the door, even if I'd been gone for only a few minutes to take the garbage to the basement,"" Abramson writes. ""I missed everything about our routine, from feeding him grilled chicken to our late-night strolls along the windy riverside.""Abramson quickly got used to not having to take a dog out, filling her time instead by reading more and playing with her gadgets (""I got an iPhone and quickly became a master of distracted living, a lifestyle not well suited to the focused playing and training a puppy needs,"" she writes).2. Traumas can put our priorities in focus.In May 2007, two months after Buddy died, Abramson was hit by a truck while crossing a street in Times Square, crushing her foot and dragging her to the ground. The accident and Abramson's resulting injuries (she also broke her pelvis and sustained internal damage) were a turning point in her life. As she said at The Huffington Post's 2013 Third Metric conference, ""I was hit by a big angry white truck in Times Square... an accident like that will put things into big bold perspective for you.""In addition to throwing herself into her work (she returned, in a wheelchair, just nine weeks after the accident, according to The New Yorker) Abramson gradually came around to the idea of getting a new dog at the urging of her husband, children and good friends, who thought it would help her emerge from a depression that, she writes, seemed to ""smother her like a hot blanket."" Scout certainly complicated her life, but she also helped infuse it with fun and happiness it was missing. 3. Our hobbies and passions can enrich our careers.At work, Abramson made no secret of her love for dogs, unabashedly showing off her ""latest Scout photos to anyone who betrayed even a hint of interest,"" she writes, and chatting with a so-called ""coterie of devoted dog owners"" at The New York Times about the ins and outs of dog ownership. She doled out advice to younger colleagues, and solicited it from experienced owners, like Sam Sifton, the paper's restaurant critic and a fellow dog fan. Embracing her passion in the office led her down new paths professionally (her book began as a column about dog rearing) and connected her with many readers who were also dog devotees.4. Intuition is more important than public opinion.When Abramson began writing about Scout, she knew it struck many of her colleagues as strange -- even silly. ""Because I have dedicated much of my career in journalism to editing and writing serious investigative stories, some of my readers -- and a few of my friends as well -- found it strange that I was publicly sharing my nervousness over Scout's first day of puppy kindergarten,"" she writes.But it was a story she felt drawn to tell, ignoring the criticism that it was somehow beneath her position. “She knew before she did the puppy diaries that she would get a lot of grief,” Trish Hall, the Times' deputy editorial-page editor told The New Yorker's Ken Auletta. “She didn’t care. I like it that she’s got this rich life. It used to be that women wouldn’t talk about when their kid had a dentist appointment. Jill doesn’t pretend that work is the only thing in her life.”5. Sometimes, a walk can make all the difference.  Soon after she brought Scout home, Abramson joined a small group of dog owners near her Connecticut house who had formed a dog walking club. Most mornings, at 7:30 a.m., they would walk in the meadows together, the dogs roaming off their leashes. The walks not only taught Abramson and her husband more than any of the books had about raising her new dog, she writes, but also became a cherished tradition. ""I had made so many new friends, both dog and human, and over the summer I had become much calmer and happier,"" she writes. When she returned to the world of morning meetings and rushing into the office, Abramson missed the simple joy of being outside, with friends, on a walk.6. There are no limits to how much we can love.  Even after a year of living with Scout, Abramson still longed for her old dog, Buddy, causing her to wonder, ""could I ever give my whole heart to Scout?"" The answer, she learned in time, was yes. Roughly three years after her accident, Abramson slipped while hiking and injured herself. When she returned home, Scout seemed to sense just what she needed, waiting calmly by the door and laying by Abramson's feet for hours on end.""During my convalescence, Scout's breathing and the sight of her white back rising and falling made me feel cozy and safe,"" she writes. ""I wouldn't say I stopped thinking about Buddy altogether, but Scout proved to be such a loving and generous companion that my attachment to her grew even stronger.""7. The unexpected moves we make are often the most valuable.Buddy -- the first dog Abramson ever owned -- was a surprise in her life in many ways, not least of all because he drew out a different aspect of her personality. ""I spent so much of my day talking, reading, and writing that it was both a relief and a joy to spend time with Buddy,"" she writes. ""Except for a few simple commands, our conversation consisted entirely of my silly cooing sand his appreciative grunts.""Dog ownership led her down new paths, both literally -- as Buddy and then Scout yanked her along during morning walks -- but also by nudging Abramson to stay open to new possibilities. ""Among other things, [Buddy] taught me that even in stressful situations, dogs have a unique way of steering you in unlikely and interesting directions."" "

Imagine, you can only interrogate with one consistent question for each thinker, one simple inquiry that would sufficiently mine the thoughts of each artistic and cultural figure. How about: ""What does creativity mean?""This is, essentially, what the short film ""Inspiring Creativity"" does. Add in the likes of Hans Ulrich Obrist, Karen Elson, Karim Rashid, Klaus Biesenbach, Lee Daniels, Tracy Emin and Moby, and you've touched on the basis of Pablo Ganguli and Tomas Auksas' exploration of 20 artists, filmmakers, musicians, writers and inventors. The film, clocking in at just over 11 minutes, invites the audience to ponder the wonders of creativity with some of the world's, well, most creative people. In it, they muse on about the rituals that inspire creative thinking and the bits of our culture -- technology, nostalgia, industry -- that spark their own innovation. For those in need of a remedy for their creative block, or simply want to infiltrate the minds of successful originators, behold: 11 things famous artists and cultural figures can teach you about creativity. (You can watch the full film above.)1. “I’ve never written a note of music for money, because money is not inspiring. If anything, it gets in the way of things.” -Hans Zimmer2. “True creativity comes from restriction and limitation.” -Paul Schrader3. “I think if it wasn't for my creativity, I would probably be dead now.” -Tracey Emin4. “I feel like we live in a culture where people are content at just being good enough. To be a viable artist or musician or filmmaker, you really had to master your craft. To be a photographer, you had to understand your camera, your film, the developing process, the printing process. Now you don’t need to know any of that.” -Moby5. “Most of us do not even know how to ask a question. Most of us do not see the root of the word ‘question’ is ‘quest’. Most of us don’t have a quest in our life.” -Richard Saul Wurman, TED founder6. “I’ve been going through screening exercises, I’ve been rolling on cylinders, and meditation is very good because somehow it makes you lose your intellectual control.” -Johan Lindeberg7. “If I wasn't creative, I don't know how I would function. I don't know who I would be.” -Karen Elson 8. “I find it important to find these subversive people who have been driven away by the shame of social networking. This world where people who are living off of their phones and who are beating the shit out of human perception.” -Lola Montes Schnabel9. ""Creativity. All those creative people you are ruining my visual world. You are ruining my food. You are ruining everything I respect. All those schools that promote creativity. I would like to ban all of you to some distant island. Why don’t you just paint, or make films, or sing, or play music? Forget creativity.” -Jonas Mekas10. “What I’ve learned to do – and just started doing this past year –- is painting on my lunch hour. I paint the actors in the film. This is just a way of generating more work from a single project.” -James Franco11. “I’ve found music over the course of my life is slightly more astoundingly inspiring than great cinema.” -Mark Romanek""Inspiring Creativity"" is a short film created by Liberatum, directed Pablo Ganguli and Tomas Auksas, and presented by illy. Fun fact, James Rosenquist helped create the original illy logo, so the company has a history of fostering the arts.Correction: An earlier edition of this article quoted Jonas Mekas as saying ""schooled"" when in fact he said ""schools.""

It could not be put more clearly: ""Climate change is a fact."" Regardless, the great national anxiety and confusion -- about where we get our energy, how it is produced and its impact on the environment -- needs to end. Congress should act, but in the face of their polarization and dysfunction, action by presidential order is warranted. Ham-fisted climate denial is still a profound political reality on the Hill, and profitable for K Street. There is no reason to expect a new or sincere Congressional discussion about economy-wide legislation to manage or limit greenhouse gases any time soon. For that to happen, the Congressional leadership would need to realize that managing carbon is not an ideological ""Obama"" ploy or hoax as trumpeted nightly by some cable news programs and late night AM radio talk shows. A national legislative response to climate change in the form of a carbon price would be the beginning of an unprecedented economic opportunity already grasped but unspoken by a significant number of investors and operating companies in the United States. Whether it takes the form of a fee, a tax, or cap and trade scheme doesn't much matter. The president, for his part, is utilizing the power of the executive office to achieve greater energy efficiency, curb carbon pollution, and seek ""a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel.""The truth is that most large operating companies with a fossil fuel footprint already manage and price their carbon emissions, many with enough reduction credits to make it profitable to do so. Dozens of the nation's biggest corporations -- including big oil -- plan for future growth while fully expecting to pay a price for carbon pollution to slow down global warming. Airlines, energy companies, the transportation sector, appliance makers, homebuilders, and others, all realize that the success of our economic and energy future lies in part with how we manage and price carbon emissions. The message from business to Congress is this: Let market forces go to work on carbon pollution. We know carbon limits will come; give us some certainty so we can plan. We are missing out on one of the greatest economic and environmental opportunities to come along in decades. Regulating or taxing carbon emissions is no longer a partisan or ideological issue -- it's a matter of business and investment, and of vital importance. A tax or fee on greenhouse gas emissions can begin to unlock the investment in the clean energy technology and innovation necessary to at least curb some of the most negative impacts of global warming and climate change.And regardless of where you stand on the Keystone XL Pipeline or natural gas or drilling in the Arctic, both the economy and the environment will change for the better when Congress acts and the market is used to price the potential risks of climate change related to fossil fuel use.Meanwhile, as outlined by President Obama in the State of the Union address last January, expect the president to exert as much executive power as he can to deal with climate change. His previous increases in automobile fuel efficiency standards are already making a large contribution, and his proposed rules on carbon emissions from power plants will be even more significant. Even without Congress, he can move the country toward what we and the world need to do to correct the market failure that is leading to the most significant environmental danger of our time."
10,POLITICS,Death to the Death Penalty,"Marjorie Cohn, ContributorProfessor Emerita, Thomas Jefferson School of Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/death-to-the-death-penalt_b_5332175.html,"It is high time for all the states in this country and the federal government itself to outlaw capital punishment. There is no good reason to retain it, and there are compelling reasons to abolish it.",2014-05-16,"FILE - The gurney in the death chamber is shown in this May 27, 2008 file photo from Huntsville, Texas. Anti-death penalty advocates believe, Texas and other states are trumping up the possibility of violence to avoid having to disclose their name of suppliers, ensuring they can keep buying the drugs they need to put condemned inmates to death. (AP Photo/Pat Sullivan, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c92e220000bb01dd77e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The recent torturous execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma has propelled the death penalty into the national discourse. The secret three-drug cocktail that prison authorities administered to Lockett -- the first to render him unconscious, the second to paralyze him and the third to stop his heart and kill him -- didn't work as planned. After writhing in pain, he finally died, allegedly of a heart attack, 43 minutes after the drugs had been administered. Madeline Cohen, a lawyer who witnessed the botched execution, said Lockett had been ""tortured to death."" A seasoned reporter who witnessed the execution said she and other reporters were ""unsettled."" President Barack Obama found it ""deeply disturbing"" and promised a review of how the death penalty is administered.But the issue is not simply the fairest and most ""painless"" and efficient method that the 32 death-penalty states should use to put someone to death. It is not just a problem of executing innocent people, or the dubious constitutionality of the death penalty, or racism in its application and imposition, or the fact that the death penalty does not deter homicide, or the higher cost of keeping someone on Death Row, or the fact that nearly all industrialized countries have abolished capital punishment. The premeditated killing of a human being by the state is just plain wrong, and the United States should abolish it.A week after Lockett's execution, the Constitution Project released its report after one of the most comprehensive examinations of capital punishment in the United States. Calling the administration of the death penalty ""deeply flawed,"" the report focused on procedural deficiencies. It recommended that death-penalty states use one drug instead of three to kill their citizens. It called for fewer constraints on post-conviction review of exonerating evidence, and for videotaping interrogations to identify false confessions, concluding that over 80 percent of 125 documented false confessions occurred in homicide cases. (Twenty percent of the defendants in those cases were sentenced to death.) It recommended the abolition of the death penalty for ""felony murder,"" in which a person participates in but does not commit the homicidal act. It expressed concern about inconsistent application of the ultimate penalty since the Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that intellectually disabled individuals should not be executed. It criticized states such as Texas, Alabama and Pennsylvania for compensating capital defense lawyers so poorly that it is ""nearly impossible"" to receive a proper defense. And it urged death-penalty states to determine whether there are racial disparities in the application of the death penalty. However, the bipartisan panel did not recommend abolition of capital punishment.Innocents on Death RowA new study just released by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences determined that 1 in every 25 people on death row is innocent. But that innocence rate of 4.1 percent is more than twice the rate of exoneration. That means an unknown number of innocent people have been put to death. ""Every time we have an execution, there is a risk of executing an innocent,"" said Richard Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. ""The risk may be small, but it's unacceptable.""Cruel and Unusual PunishmentThe Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution outlaws ""cruel and unusual punishments."" Although the Supreme Court has upheld the death penalty, some justices have concluded that it violates the Eighth Amendment. In 1972, in Furman v. Georgia, the high court imposed a moratorium on the death penalty because it was arbitrarily imposed. Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority that executions were ""so wantonly and so freakishly imposed"" that they were ""cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual."" But Justice Stewart was only opposed to capital punishment as a matter of policy. States revised their death-penalty statutes to eliminate arbitrariness, and four years later the Supreme Court upheld Georgia's new and improved death-penalty law in Gregg v. Georgia. Unlike Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, Justice Stewart did not believe the death penalty was unconstitutional. Justice Marshall noted in his concurrence in Furman:Perhaps the most important principle in analyzing ""cruel and unusual"" punishment questions is [that] ... the cruel and unusual language ""must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society."" ...Justice Brennan also concurred in Furman. He wrote:When examined by the principles applicable under the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, death stands condemned as fatally offensive to human dignity. The punishment of death is therefore ""cruel and unusual,"" and the States may no longer inflict it as a punishment for crimes. Rather than kill an arbitrary handful of criminals each year, the States will confine them in prison.Eighteen years after Furman, Justice Harry Blackmun came to the conclusion that the death penalty is unconstitutional. In 1994, his last year on the Supreme Court, Justice Blackmun famously wrote, ""From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.""Most recently, in 2008, Justice John Paul Stevens decided that the death penalty amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Stevens concluded, quoting Justice Byron White's Furman concurrence:[T]he imposition of the death penalty represents ""the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes. A penalty with such negligible returns to the State [is] patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment.""In his new book, Six Amendments, Justice Stevens proposes that the Eighth Amendment be changed to read, ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments such as the death penalty inflicted.""Racism in ImpositionAccording to Death Penalty Focus, the race of the victim and the race of the defendant in capital cases are major determinants in who is sentenced to death in the United States. A 1990 report by the General Accounting Office found:In 82 percent of the studies [reviewed], race of victim was found to influence the likelihood of being charged with capital murder or receiving the death penalty, i.e., those who murdered whites were found to be more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered blacks.The Innocence Project reports that of the 316 post-conviction DNA exonerations, 198 involved African Americans.ThinkProgress reports that African-American defendants convicted of killing whites are much more likely to receive a sentence of death than white defendants convicted of killing African Americans. Since 1976 only 20 white people have been have been executed in the United States for killing a black person, but 271 black defendants were executed for killing a white person. Death sentences in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, are 97-percent more likely in murder cases when the victim is white. Florida has never executed a white person for killing a black person. Not a DeterrentCapital punishment does not deter people from committing homicide. Dartmouth University statistician John Lamperti notes that ""an overwhelming majority among America's leading criminologists [have concluded that] capital punishment does not contribute to lower rates of homicide."" In fact, murder rates in non-death-penalty states are lower than murder rates in states with the death penalty, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.Life Without Parole Saves MoneyThe alternative to the death penalty is life in prison without the possibility of parole. Judge Arthur Alarcón and Prof. Paula Mitchell concluded that the cost of the death penalty in California has totaled over $4 billion since 1978. They calculated that a gubernatorial commutation of those sentences would result in an immediate savings of $170 million per year, a savings of $5 billion over the next 20 years. The California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice found in 2008:The additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons where those sentenced to life without possibility of parole ordinarily serve their sentences, is $90,000 per year per inmate.International ConsensusInternational treaties and customary norms forbid capital punishment. They include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its Second Optional Protocol, and Protocol No. 6 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Concerning the Abolition of the Death Penalty. Last year only 22 countries not involved in military conflict carried out executions. The United Nations Human Rights Committee found the United States to be in noncompliance with its obligations under the ICCPR due to the excessive number of offenses subject to the death penalty and the number of death sentences imposed. Amnesty International reports that the countries that carried out the most executions in 2013 were China, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and the United States. Does the United States really want this to be its peer group?End Institutionalized MurderFive U.S. states have abolished capital punishment in the last seven years. Support for the death penalty in the United States is waning. In October 2013, 60 percent of Americans favored capital punishment, down 20-percent from 1994. The American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Board of Anesthesiology and the American Nurses Association prohibit members from assisting in executions; they consider it a violation of their medical code of ethics.Years after witnessing the excesses of the French Revolution, the Marquis de Lafayette told the French Chamber of Deputies in 1830, ""I shall ask for the abolition of the punishment of death until I have the infallibility of human judgment demonstrated to me."" Indeed, as Eugene Robinson wrote in The Washington Post:We fool ourselves if we think there is a ""humane"" way to ... kill someone. ...Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg wrote in 1976, ""The deliberate, institutionalized taking of human life by the state is the greatest conceivable degradation to the dignity of the human personality.""It is high time for all the states in this country and the federal government itself to outlaw capital punishment. There is no good reason to retain it, and there are compelling reasons to abolish it.Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, a former president of the National Lawyers Guild and the deputy secretary general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.

India's stock market and currency rallied Tuesday on exit polls predicting election victory for the pro-business BJP and its allies. Official results are expected on Friday. (AP Photo/Ajit Solanki)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1365124000033002285dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Malini Menon and Rajesh Kumar SinghNEW DELHI, May 16 (Reuters) - Opposition candidate Narendra Modi thundered to victory on Friday in India's election, with partial results showing that the pro-business Hindu nationalist and his party trounced the ruling Nehru-Gandhi dynasty in a seismic political shift.Modi's landslide, the most resounding election victory India has seen in 30 years, was welcomed with a blistering rally on India's stock markets and raucous celebrations at offices across the country of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), where supporters danced, exploded fireworks and gave out sweets.The BJP looked certain of a parliamentary majority, giving the 63-year-old former tea-seller ample room to advance economic reforms which were started 23 years ago by current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but stalled in recent years.Singh's Congress party suffered its worst ever wipeout, a big boost to Modi's goal of ending the dominance of the Nehru-Gandhi family that has governed for most of the 67 years of independent India.Singh, whose party looked set to win less than 50 of the 543 parliamentary seats at stake, congratulated Modi with a telephone call.Crowds surged around Modi's car after he visited his mother's home in the western state of Gujarat, where he has been chief minister since 2001.He sent a message saying ""India has won"" that instantly set a record as the country's most retweeted Twitter post.The desire for change has been so strong that voters put aside concerns about Modi's Hindu-centric politics.""I'm so happy because all of India wanted a strong government,"" shouted software engineer Vinod Rai at the BJP's Delhi headquarters. Rai echoed the sentiments of millions of Indians who bought into Modi's promises of job creation and economic growth to satisfy a bulging youth population.With more than six times the seats of its closest rival, Modi's is the most decisive mandate for a leader since the 1984 assassination of prime minister Indira Gandhi propelled her son to office. Since 1989, India has been governed by coalitions.The BJP had already won or was winning in 283 seats in parliament, counting trends showed, comfortably across the halfway mark of 272 required to rule. An alliance led by the party was ahead in 338 seats, TV channel NDTV said. MARKETS SOARResponding to the news, Indian markets got off to a roaring start, with the rupee breaking below 59 to the U.S. dollar, an 11-month high, and the benchmark stock index jumping 6 percent to a record high before paring its gains.Betting on a Modi win, foreign investors have poured more than $16 billion into Indian stocks and bonds in the past six months and now hold over 22 percent of Mumbai-listed equities - a stake estimated by Morgan Stanley at almost $280 billion. Unlike his predecessors, Modi will not have to deal with unruly partners as he implements reform. That could usher in profound economic changes, and he will try to replicate his success in attracting investment and building infrastructure in Gujarat, the state he has governed for more than 12 years.""He can afford to have a smaller but stronger cabinet, that means a far more decisive government. He has been saying less government and more governance, we are really likely to see that,"" said Navneet Munot, Chief Investment Officer at SBI Funds Management in Mumbai.But with India's economy suffering its worst slowdown since the 1980s and battling high inflation, it will not be an easy task to meet the hopes of millions of Indians who have bought into the idea that Modi will quickly push their country onto the top table of global economic powers.His party also lacks strength in the upper house of parliament, where backing is needed for legislation to pass.""It's important to be realistic about how quickly they can instigate change. It takes time to, number one, get economic reforms through the political machinery and, number two, it also takes a while before economic reforms actually have a positive impact,"" said Leif Eskesen, an economist at HSBC in Singapore. DESIRE FOR CHANGEIndia's election was the world's largest ever. Staggered over five weeks, a record of more than 500 million ballots were cast from the Himalayas in the north to the tropical south, with voters braving blistering heat for a record 66 percent turnout.Since being named as his party's candidate last September, Modi has flown 300,000 km (186,000 miles) and addressed 457 rallies in a slick, presidential-style campaign that broke the mould of Indian politics.Modi contrasted his humble roots with the cloistered life of privilege of his dynastic rivals.He ran circles around his slow-footed opponent Rahul Gandhi, 43, from the Congress party which his family has dominated since his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, led India to independence from Britain in 1947.Rahul, his Italian-born mother and leader of the party, Sonia, beside him, shouldered blame for their party's rout.""The Congress has done pretty badly, there is a lot for us to think about. As vice president of the party I hold myself responsible.""Both mother and son held onto their own seats, but these were the only ones their party clinched in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 lawmakers to parliament.Prime Minister Singh launched reforms in 1991 as finance minister that opened India's socialist economy to global capital, but his spell in the top job ended marred by corruption and a floundering economy amid mounting policy paralysis. He has already bid farewell to his staff after ten years in office.A dark chapter of violence against Muslims on Modi's watch in Gujarat has mattered less and less to many, including a ballooning middle class alarmed by dwindling purchasing power and job opportunities as the economy slumped to sub-five percent growth in the last two years.Modi has promised that, if elected, he would take decisive action to unblock stalled investments in power, road and rail projects to revive economic growth.Tax and labor market reforms, backed by a gradual opening up to foreign investment, would seek to create the 10 million jobs that Asia's third-largest economy needs every year to absorb young people entering the workforce.
