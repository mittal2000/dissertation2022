""No censure of Japan means they will be off to the money printing presses.""After late-night talks, finance ministers and central bankers agreed on wording closer than expected to a joint statement issued last Tuesday by the Group of Seven rich nations backing market-determined exchange rates.A draft communique on Friday had steered clear of the G7's call for economic policy not to be targeted at exchange rates. But the final version included a G20 commitment to refrain from competitive devaluations and stated monetary policy would be directed only at price stability and growth.""The mood quite clearly early on was that we needed desperately to avoid protectionist measures ... that mood permeated quite quickly,"" Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told reporters, adding that the wording of the G20 statement had been hardened up by the ministers.As a result, it reflected a substantial, but not complete, endorsement of Tuesday's proclamation by the G7 nations - the United States, Japan, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Italy.As with the G7 intervention, Tokyo said it gave it a green light to pursue its policies unchecked.""I have explained that (Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe's administration is doing its utmost to escape from deflation and we have gained a certain understanding,"" Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters.""We're confident that if Japan revives its own economy that would certainly affect the world economy as well. We gained understanding on this point.""Flaherty admitted it would be difficult to gauge if domestic policies were aimed at weakening currencies or not. NO FISCAL TARGETSThe G20 also made a commitment to a credible medium-term fiscal strategy, but stopped short of setting specific goals as most delegations felt any economic recovery was too fragile.The communique said risks to the world economy had receded but growth remained too weak and unemployment too high.""A sustained effort is required to continue building a stronger economic and monetary union in the euro area and to resolve uncertainties related to the fiscal situation in the United States and Japan, as well as to boost domestic sources of growth in surplus economies,"" it said.A debt-cutting pact struck in Toronto in 2010 will expire this year if leaders fail to agree to extend it at a G20 summit of leaders in St Petersburg in September.The United States says it is on track to meet its Toronto pledge but argues that the pace of future fiscal consolidation must not snuff out demand. Germany and others are pressing for another round of binding debt targets.""We had a broad consensus in the G20 that we will stick to the commitment to fulfill the Toronto goals,"" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. ""We do not have any interest in U.S.-bashing ... In St. Petersburg follow-up-goals will be decided.""The G20 put together a huge financial backstop to halt a market meltdown in 2009 but has failed to reach those heights since. At successive meetings, Germany has pressed the United States and others to do more to tackle their debts. Washington in turn has urged Berlin to do more to increase demand.Backing in the communique for the use of domestic monetary policy to support economic recovery reflected the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to monetary stimulus through quantitative easing, or QE, to promote recovery and jobs.QE entails large-scale bond buying -- $85 billion a month in the Fed's case -- that helps economic growth but has also unleashed destabilising capital flows into emerging markets.A commitment to minimise such ""negative spillovers"" was an offsetting point in the text that China, fearful of asset bubbles and lost export competitiveness, highlighted.""Major developed nations (should) pay attention to their monetary policy spillover,"" Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao was quoted by state news agency Xinhua as saying in Moscow.Russia, this year's chair of the G20, admitted the group had failed to reach agreement on medium-term budget deficit levels and expressed concern about ultra-loose policies that it and other emerging economies say could store up trouble for later.On currencies, the G20 text reiterated its commitment last November, ""to move more rapidly toward mores market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments"".It said disorderly exchange rate movements and excess volatility in financial flows could harm economic and financial stability."

In music, Veronica Falls' ""Waiting for Something to Happen"" relied on a familiar sound that left most critics underwhelmed. Nataly Dawn received negative marks for her lifeless delivery on ""How I Knew Her"" and Ulrich Schnauss was called out for not challenging himself creatively with ""A Long Way to Fall.""

Recently, some in Congress have attempted to take catch shares off the table for fishery managers, limiting regional councils' ability to make the best decision for their fishermen. Catch shares help eliminate overfishing and restore fish stocks by dividing the total scientifically approved allowable catch among the fishermen and ending short seasons and derbies. Catch shares have been proven to recover fish populations, increase compliance with catch limits, reduce waste, stabilize revenue and increase business efficiency. In more than 115 meetings, the fishermen and chefs stood together to make it clear that catch shares are working, they are making American fisheries more sustainable and they have had positive impacts not only on fishermen, but the seafood industry. Chef Rick Moonen of rm Seafood in Las Vegas delivered a letter to Congress signed by chefs from around the country, including Eric Ripert, Mario Batali, Hugh Acheson, Kerry Heffernan, and Susan Spicer just to name a few. Chef Moonen made his support for catch shares clear while in Washington, D.C. In a press release distributed Wednesday, he said: ""Embracing the idea of serving my customers sustainable seafood has been a primary focus over the past 25 years of my professional career as a chef. Catch share programs naturally create an incentive for environmental preservation and species stewardship by the fishermen who rely on their health to succeed. Restaurants will then get to experience a more consistent supply of properly handled fish, more stable prices, longer seasons and more species diversity. Most importantly we need to provide the fishermen with the tools they need, like fully funded catch share programs.""Catch shares are making huge impacts around the world. More than 65 percent of all fish landed in United States federal waters are landed under a catch share fishing program providing a healthy ecosystem, fishing jobs, and a consistent supply of sustainable seafood.The full day of meetings culminated in a reception honoring Fishing Families Champions, where EDF recognized Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine for their tireless advocacy for American fishermen. The fishermen and chefs certainly left their mark on Washington this week and everyone is hopeful that we'll see more champions like Sen. Murkowski and Rep. Pingree emerge. There is still work to be done, but America's local fishery management councils can't be limited by special interests in Congress from making what they believe to be the best decision for their fishermen."

That number is 2.4 billion.That staggering number is the median estimate of birds in the United States killed each year by domestic cats. Fluffy, Ginger, Tabitha, etc. Many thousands of millions of birds because we put feral cats in our woodlands (the majority of the kills) and allow our house cats out of the house. These numbers are revealed in a new study by Smithsonian and Fish and Wildlife Researchers, which in turn is built upon more than a score of close studies.Their results modeled a range of 1.4 to 3.7 billion kills of birds by cats, and, perhaps more incredibly, kills of 6.9 to 20.7 billion kills of small mammals by cats in our country each year. Billions! This study makes clear that cats are, by far and away, the most single important cause of wildlife loss by an anthropogenic (human-linked) cause in the nation. Birds killed by cars, by windows, by lighted towers, by wind energy? Merely millions. Cats? Billions.I am a conservation biologist and have been part of diverse studies of other human-linked effects on wildlife through the years. While the concerns in those studies are usually about specific species and regional threats, those numbers (if estimated) usually estimate dozens, or scores, or hundreds, and maybe sometimes thousands of birds lost to an issue. Our and other recent success in working with the Department of Interior in protecting key Arctic Alaska habitats from development meant the protection of millions of nesting birds and hundreds of thousands of caribou. Only millions and thousands. Not billions. Passenger pigeons were considered the most abundant bird on earth, and were thought to number between 3 and 5 billion birds at the time of European settlement in North America. The extinction of the Passenger Pigeon is considered one of the most dramatic extinctions due to humans ever. Our cats, particularly the feral cats we have directly or indirectly put out to roam, kill the equivalent of passenger pigeon peak abundance on an annual basis.Most everyone would agree that keeping house cats (estimated to be some 29 percent of the kills -- say ""only"" some 700 million birds worth) in the house and confronting the bigger problem of feral cats is needed. If you love cats and care about nature, there are billions of reasons to keep your cats out of the wild."

The NBA, NBA TV and Turner Sports -- the owners of the 2013 NBA All-Star Weekend in Houston, Texas are programming otherwise, touting anniversary specials, yes, with MJ, but also with his longtime rival and sidekick Charles Barkley, he of TNT Sports. They'll also do a special salute to the only living player to ever walk a court who is better and was more impactful than Sir Rare Air, that being the great Bill Russell.Well, the Digital Sports Desk thinks otherwise. Our programming will be different with all due respect to Russell, Jordan and Sir Chuck, my favorite player of all-time.The 2013 NBA All-Star Weekend is a rather quick return to the land of the Johnson Space Center after performances in 1989 at the ancient but once modern-day wonder AstroDome and a 2006 soiree at the downtown Houston building block known as the Toyota Center. But for some reason, we're back in the land of ""we have a problem"" with a storyline that most NBA fans no longer appreciate. The fact of the matter is that this weekend is NBA Commissioner David Stern's last NBA All-Star Game where he will sit in the driver's seat in the same manner that astronaut Neil Armstrong sat in the commander's seat of Apollo 11. It is Stern who will say, ""Let the games begin,"" and he will push the Blast-off button and the curtain will go up on an NBA extravaganza that has no equal.When Stern took over the NBA during the 1984 NBA All-Star Weekend in Denver, the very first seeds for ""event greatness"" were in place. Much because of the legacy of the 1976 ABA All-Star Game and its iconic Slam-Dunk Contest which featured the likes of Artis Gilmore and Darnell Hillman but is long remembered because of the Rocky Mountain High duel between Julius ""Dr. J"" Erving and David Thompson, the powers that were in place with the Denver Nuggets' front office, namely Carl Scheer, pushed the NBA league office hard to stage ""another"" Slam Dunk. Stern and his fledgling NBA were beginning to spread some wings in terms of national sponsorship sales and the chess pieces were played. Miller High Life held some marketing rights, Schick (razors) took on the ""Old-Timer's Game"" and American Airlines signed up while ESPN only agreed to televise the ancillary event after a hard arm-twist, albeit on tape delay. CBS Sports took a complete pass in favor of another Boom Boom Mancini Saturday afternoon bout on CBS Sports Saturday/Sunday but after the fact, the George Washington of courtside reporters, Pat O'Brien and his ""At the Half"" crew took to the edit rooms to bring the highlights to a nation thirsty for rim-rocking.The Stern legacy began at McNichols Arena where former Celtics great and Miller LITE hawker Tommy Heisohn tugged at the ""tight"" short of the late Johnny Red Kerr and the term old-timer became ""Legend"" right in front of a nation that had long forgotten Joe DiMaggio and preferred their roundball dunked rather than spit upon. Dr. J took it from there but the script writers tore up their work. There were new sheriffs in town and their names were Orlando Woolridge, Darnell Griffith, Edgar Jones and Larry Nance, the latter the lone wolf who went eye-to-eye with the rim and defeated the great Dr. J much to the delight of an audience standing on its feet, witnessing pro basketball history.I was lucky, as I had a front row seat and was pretty much the notary public to the new will and testament being inked on NBA courts nationwide.The '84 NBA draft had delivered Hall of Famers like Hakeem (then Akeem) Olajuwon, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, John Stockton and the booming age of NCAA basketball was delivering a host of supporting actors, like Alvin Robertson, Otis Thorpe, Sam Bowie, Kevin Willis, Michael Cage and Sam Perkins, much to the wonderment of NBA coaches everywhere. The talent level was rising and then along came the 1985 NBA Draft and with it, superstars for every port. Patrick Ewing went to New York and the Knickerbockers were instantly revived but the second-coming continued and Chris Mullin was dispatched to SF/Oakland to rejuvenate the Warriors, Karl Malone fit in with Stockton and the Utah Jazz would be a contender for a decade to come, Joe Dumars joined up with Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons were blessed. The depth chart in Chicago grew deeper as the Bulls maneuvered to land Charles Oakley and the NBA chess pieces were in place from coast-to-coast.All the while, Stern was working his magic with cable TV deals far before anyone saw their value, with satellite tv delivery for international broadcasters far-and-wide, with a slew of sponsorship sales and their partnership business models that made TV industry execs stand-up and take notice. The NBA had placed its league on a solid foundation, born of a ""new fangled"" salary cap style collective bargaining agreement and back-up with the very first comprehensive anti-drug agreement in modern-day work-force history. NBA players, like the player's association president Bob Lanier, were saying ""test us"" and may the younger generation get the message that ""if you're going to be an NBA player, you better say ""No"" to drugs. The league's two-person ""entertainment"" division went into overdrive and the Public Service Announcements of ""Don't Foul Out"" became as powerful as the highlight spots claiming, ""NBA Action ... It's Fan-tastic!""The juggernaut lifted off.Stern was at the helm and along came a world of basketball fanatics, many of them media members who just ""loved the game"" and helped bring a legion of baby-boomers along with a ""hip, cool, you want (and are very welcome) to be a part of this"" attitude that was our mantra. And that aspect of Stern's leadership was the secret sauce that the Teaneck-born, Chelsea-bred Commish learned to whip-up at his father's deli in New York City. (Part Two of this series will tell the story of the ultimate ""behind the scenes"" man in basketball, Stern's cohort Russ Granik)."

Hair is terribly personal, a tangle of mysterious prejudices."" -- Shana Alexander, American journalistCelebrity hairstylist Ursula Stephen cried as we talked about... hair. It caught me off guard as I hadn't considered the possibility of tears during an interview about celebrity cuts and color. What I discovered however, was that Ursula was a woman who was not only well-versed in the mechanics of her craft, but acutely aware its profound social, cultural and political significance. Barely speaking through her tears, we talked about her trip to South Africa where she worked with women of color whose natural hair texture was almost unrecognizable -- marred by years of improper relaxers, no conditioner and an incessant desire to manipulate their hair into straight, Anglo-inspired styles. As she ran her fingers through the hair of women who knew virtually nothing about how to care for their own hair, she understood that their dry, brittle strands were vestiges of their apartheid past. Their hair whispered stories of their history; and Ursula was moved to tears by what she heard.Despite the fact that Elle magazine has lauded her as ""hair royalty,"" Ursula Stephen remains remarkably humble and painstakingly human. She's yet to allow herself to become jaded or disconnected from the essence of her craft in a haze of global jet setting with one of the biggest popstars on the planet. Her two Vogue covers with Rihanna haven't rendered all else unimportant. She remains firmly grounded -- using her talent as a conduit to help women feel beautiful, empowered and recognize better versions of themselves. From those uncovering their identity soaked in layers of racial injustice, to a pop-princess asserting her power as an icon, Ursula remains equally inspired.Below are excerpts from my conversation with Ursula Stephen, who proves that in her industry, style does not always trump substance.Robyn: What are your thoughts on the increasing number of women of color who are choosing to wear their hair in more natural styles? Bloggers like Taryn Guy, Chescaleigh, Urban Bush Babes, Curly Nikki and Hey Fran Hey, have become Internet celebrities and gained huge followings, essentially by sharing their natural hair journey and styling tips.Ursula: I think the movement that's happening right now is really great. Women are gaining a certain sense of self confidence. For a long time, if you wore your hair natural, people didn't associate you with being pretty, stylish or sexy. And now, with so many different styling options and different products available, it just makes it so much the better for the natural girl to really show her beautiful self.I'm a hairstylist and I'm down for whatever -- weaves, braids, bald heads, short hair, etc. I appreciate styles for what they are. I think everything is beautiful. Every image. Every picture. Every person. But the fact is that so many women are losing themselves behind weaves and extensions. So I'm happy that women can feel and be beautiful with natural hair because they were losing that sense of themselves for a long time. That's why they were losing their edges and hair because they were becoming essentially dependent on these extensions. They forgot about their own natural hair and how beautiful and how healthy it could be.At the end of the day, a healthy head of hair is the foundation for a great hairstyle. So they sacrifice their own hair because they want to wear these expensive weaves and braids... but then the weaves and braids start looking crazy because they don't have any hair. It was like a bad cycle that we were going through. I think this movement is helping women to get back to who they are and really appreciate themselves. Women are learning that weaves and braids are just accessories to be worn for a certain amount of time, and to be taken out for a certain amount of time.Robyn: You cut Rihanna's hair into the infamous bob -- a haircut which many people credit with helping to catapult her career into superstardom. Tell me a bit about the thought process that went into going short. Because prior to the cut, her long hair, flowing tresses mirrored her popstar counterparts. You guys were taking a bit of a risk because the long weave seemed to be an essential part of the popstar formula.Ursula: That was one of the reasons why we did it -- because she was tired of looking like everybody else. Plus, I was tired of doing the same old thing for her and for everybody else. And we just went for it. But we never thought that it was going to be talked about to the extent that it was. That wasn't the aim. It was really just a matter of being tired of looking like that... like everybody else. It's something that we just did. We never knew that it would be this world-renowned haircut. So I wasn't nervous when I cut her hair, because we had no idea it would be so big.I think I realized that the cut was a big deal when I started seeing everybody, not only in New York, with the haircut. It had even gone overseas. No matter where I would go -- New York, L.A., London, Paris, Germany -- somebody was taking some piece of what she had done to her hair. It was everywhere. It was crazy.Robyn: What has been your experience in the entertainment industry as it relates to standards of beauty... particularly black beauty?Ursula: I think there is a little prejudice towards it, but it's unsaid. No one speaks about it. You know, you have other artists that are darker skinned and they just don't really go that far. There are a few exceptions. But the percentage is so small. No one really speaks about it.I don't think anyone has ever come to me and said, ""Oh she's too dark, so we wont show her or we wont put her in front."" Nothing like that. It's just something that silently happens. There are all of the artists out front -- the light-skinned girls with long hair and all of that. But that's what I liked about the whole movement with Rihanna. She did cut her hair and she did shave her hair. She was this super pretty girl that was so rebellious with her hair that it was an oxymoron. So it messed everybody up. It let people actually see that you could be gorgeous, successful, and make it in this industry and not have long hair down to your knee caps or boobs up to your chin. It's possible. So it is possible to change these standards. And I think it is happening now. Now people are embracing it more because you have the rule breakers like Rihanna who have shown that.It's funny because every time I have creative meetings with an A&R executive, or whoever is in charge of how they want an artist to look... it's usually men. And that's what men want. They want to see the light-skin-and-long-hair girl because that's their fantasy. Before you would go into a creative meeting and people would give you references of all these long-hair artists... you know, the Mariahs, the Beyonces, and all that type of thing. But now that Rihanna has come along, she's changed the game. Now I go into creative meetings and they give me references of my own work... of funky, short hair cuts. And now that's in the limelight. That's what's beautiful. So it's changing. It's definitely changing. It's absolutely changing. Robyn: How does it feel to know that your work has made a cultural impact?Ursula: That part makes me feel great. It makes me feel happy and proud. Because I am that young girl who was different than other young girls growing up. Who didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do. Even with my hair and my identity... I went through that too. So the fact that I can give that confidence to to other girls, that's the best part of the whole deal.But I don't want people to minimize it either, and think that you can just cut your hair in a bob or shave your hair on one side and you're going to be a popstar. It's not just a cookie cutter method. And so my point in saying that is we did it because it was real. We weren't in a lab saying, ""Oh, this is going to make them go crazy."" We did it because it was real. It was a real feeling. It was a real movement. It was a real team behind it. The team worked together from hair to makeup to wardrobe, to everything. And that's important when you are an artist. You have to have a great team. And you have to work well together.Robyn: When you were in South Africa with Motions, Rihanna tweeted the following: ""*Meanwhile on set* Being able to do hair and being able to do black hair are 2 different things! #magazines please pay attention."" What were your thoughts when you saw that statement?""Ursula: (laughs) I actually never saw that tweet from her, so I can't confirm whether she said that or not. And since I did not see it and have not spoken to her about it, I cannot confirm exactly why she said that. I was in South Africa under contract with Motions, so there were a few projects I was not there for.But if she did send that tweet, it sounds like she was on set and they must have hired whoever they wanted to hire for her hair and it didn't come out well. That is a thing that happens in this industry big time. It is really hard for the brown girls to get on certain sets. Very hard for the brown girl. And I've been doing Rihanna's hair since 2007... through every look that everybody loved, hated, maybe liked, maybe disliked... but still talked about it regardless. And there are editorials that will come up, and those people who are the decision makers will say that they don't want me. They want to use their own people. So how can you want this artist to be in your magazine because of the way she looks which I had something to do with, but now you don't want to use me for your magazine cover? So now they bring anybody in, who, chances are, it's somebody who is not brown and has no knowledge of black hair. And black hair needs to be understood to be done well and properly. And so you brought this person in because they must have a big name or whatever political reason they have, and then the artist is not happy because her hair looks like shit. It's a crazy thing. As a black stylist, I've always been able to go on the set and do black, white, Asian, and all types of hair. But we can't get the job. They wont give us the job.Robyn: We talked earlier about women of color in the States starting to embracing their natural hair. Tell me a bit about the women you recently worked with in South Africa? Do they have a similar relationship to their hair as the women of color in the States?Ursula: Oh no. We are miles ahead of them here in the States. They really don't have knowledge of their own hair types. They really don't get it. And I don't want to get too political about it, but just from going back and forth from the States to South Africa, they are really into other people and other cultures there. You know, apartheid really just finished over there. It seems like it was a long time ago, but for them that are living in it, it's still now. So I think that plays into it. (crying) I'm sorry. I think that plays a lot in their views on their hair type. So they don't have the knowledge. They're doing relaxers really wrong. They don't condition it. Not that they want to mimic white people necessarily, but they just think that they want to get their hair to be straight like theirs... so they don't take the time to understand their own.I speak to all the girls and talk to them because I do classes over there. So I ask them what they think is wrong? And they say that they do not condition their hair. They just relax and that is it. It's never been taught to them. They don't know. And so they have just really dry, dry hair. They've just given up on it and it's just there. And it's so different than the states because in the states your hair is a part of your beauty. So it is a totally different world. It hurt me because, I'm in a class trying to teach or in a workshop, and I'm like ""oh my God... I can't believe you guys are doing it that wrong."" They have no knowledge of their hair type or how to care for it. Nothing. (crying)Robyn: What surprises you the most about what you have managed to achieve in your career?Ursula:  Maybe one of the things that actually surprises me most is that I turned the one thing that made me happy and loved to do into a career. Because that bothered me for a long time. I think the view of being a hairstylist has changed now. But when I was trying to do it, it wasn't viewed as a career. It wasn't really respected. But I didn't care. I was young. I loved it. That's all I knew. That's all I wanted to do. Hair, hair, hair all the time. Even for free... I would just do it. But then I got to a point where I was grown and I needed to make sure I created something stable.And I would fear that because I knew I had my mother to answer to. You know, having to answer questions like, ""You didn't finish school, so what are you going to do? You're just going to keep on doing hair?"" So I had to really make it solid. And I feel like I'm in the process of doing that. I'm not going to say that I've done it, because I still have a lot of things that I want to do. But I like the path that I'm on in general. Robyn: Tell me something you've learned on your journey. Was there ever a moment on your path -- prior to your success -- where you considered quitting?Ursula:  I went through a difficult transition time. I was in the salon and just really going through it. I was tired of being behind the chair and I wanted something different. And so I decided that I was going to really start freelancing. And so I started doing it, but it was so hard financially. I almost decided not to freelance anymore. I was talking to my agent Krystal, and would tell her things like, ""I'm not doing it anymore."" Because when I worked in the salon, I would make cash. And so I always had money and it was easy. My bills were getting paid. But now when you start working freelance, it's like you have to wait, and your tunraround time for checks are very different than the salon. So in that transition period, I didn't make it where it was revolving quickly enough yet. And so it was rough for me. I was losing my clients. I practically lost most of them because I was so in and out of the salon with the freelance thing. So I was totally broke at the time.But I was like, you know what Urse, just pray and wait. Let's just see. And before I knew it I just started really working and I started making money and it just started coming. And I realized that I had put like 15 years into the salon and saw all the benefits. So I talked to myself a bit... and I said, in order for you to see the benefits with freelance, you've just got to close your eyes and don't look back. You just have to jump in and put your hundred percent and see what comes out of it. It worked. Everything worked out the way it should of.Follow Ursula Stephen on Twitter: www.twitter.com/UrsulaStephen."

(Photo by Chelsea Lauren/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd2722100005100c54765.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There was a time, long ago, when fashion shows were a private matter. Gone are the days when Coco Chanel sat at the top of the staircase of her Rue Cambon salon, peering down while a very small group of fashion professionals; buyers, editors and writers furiously sketched and took notes and made serious decisions as to what would fly and what would define at that moment in time the word chic. The take away was a perfect presentation, with no distractions, no peripheral information to distract from the task at hand, that of expressing the couturier's vision in cut and draped fabric wrapped around living mannequins and finished off with flawless hair, makeup and accessories like icing on a cake. So, of course, we have watched the de-evolution of this process over the past several decades... beginning with ready-to-wear, the celebrity-in-the-front-row phenomenon, and now with the advent of handheld mobile technology, a complete breakdown of the houses having any control whatsoever of the ""public image"" which is seen instantaneously from third row hands straight onto social media. Now, mix this with, as Cathy Horyn pointed out, the fact that there are too many presentations and not enough talent, topped off with Suze Menkes' lament of the new sideshow, the ""circus"" that now takes place physically right outside of the venue where the show is about to take place. This new stop, pose and tweet phenomena is now as much if not more fodder for this constant need to ""report"" on something. The bloggers, having come at the industry straight on but painfully unnoticed for so long, (until Miss Gevinson wore that hat) have made up their own purpose for getting out of bed in the morning, as they have decided that their own creativity is as authentic as the designers whose shows they live to attend.One might even make the argument that it is they who should really be funding these events, rather than the houses, as they benefit from the backdrop increasingly more so than the organization that shelled out to appear on a white commercial catwalk for their own 15 minutes tops. Can we ever go back? No, never. Ask elder statesman Tom Ford, who attempted to show to just a ""select group of editors"" and his super-famous best friends, not release any images until several months later and try to hold on to that private club from a galaxy far far away. How did that work out for him? It was a bit of a yawn in terms of process and seems he is returning to the runway during London Fashion Week along with everyone else. You cant ignore the reality that even at a brilliant theatrical show presentation like that of Thom Browne, you notice that no one is looking up at the models in their painstakingly put together outfits. Nope, instead, they are staring at the screens on their phones. It's 2013. Like it or not, everyone is a photographer, everyone is a videographer... and I've seen the tweets to prove it. And Instargam filters or not, the images aren't very good. Yes, they allow you to say, ""I've seen it!"" but what exactly is it? So, when the show invitees are staring at their own screens and there is a sub-show happening before and after your show, what's a designer to do? The experience they work so hard to provide in order to forward their creative vision has been completely twisted into a self-serving exercise for those in attendance. Have they completely lost control?Why yes they have! Is there anything they can do about it? Why yes there is! Take the case of Peter Som, who relinquished his show time slot and opted instead to do a purely digital presentation, painstakingly filmed in advance, with fewer models, the walk perfected, the designer himself sitting up front overseeing exactly how, visually, every look was to be consumed. They released the finished presentation on digitalfashionshows.com this morning and the purpose was clearly defined. It's not an event that benefits the hangers on, but rather, he has taken back, for all designers, the possibility of having complete control of the presentation for himself. The public will be served a very well thought out image of the creative work, rather than poorly composed snapchats and dead looking quick digital images taken in haste by amateurs and spread all over the world in an instant. It feels like sucha waste.I must admit that I am biased towards this, being a photographer and a filmmaker, the idea of composing a designers symphony from all the right angles, the textures, the movement, the sparkle in the models eye. Let it be embedded, reblogged, excerpted, grab some stills, make it public all right, but limited to the visual image the house controls. Not after the fact, like campaigns function now, but in real time. One day designers will realize the campaign is already happening the moment the lights dim and the music begins, not six months later when the new magazines come out. They must, as Mademoiselle Chanel did from her staircase perch, have a public image, limited."

So on a recent flight from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Miami, she obediently stepped into the airport's full-body scanner, held her arms up and waited for the agent to wave her through.He didn't.Instead, a female screener was summoned to give Burton an ""enhanced"" pat-down. ""My breasts were patted down right there in front of God and everybody,"" she says. ""I wasn't even afforded the privacy of a screen. I was so stunned, I was just mute. What do you say without being arrested? What should I have done?""Good question. To paraphrase Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, she should have said something.Why do people keep their mouths closed when they feel violated? A combination of powerful motivators keeps air travelers quiet. Only by understanding these influences can we end them.Reason #1: you're not crazy, are you?Many passengers are afraid that if they speak up, they'll end up as the hysterical passenger on YouTube -- reacting irrationally to what many consider ""rational"" airport security.I wrote about this incident after it happened. Although there were good reasons for her reaction, according to her son who taped the entire episode, she was nonetheless tarred as a loonie by TSA supporters (read the comments on her video if you doubt me).Reason #2: everyone else is doing itAnother effective tool of persuasion: peer pressure. Everyone else is going through the scanner; everyone else is getting patted down. What's your problem? Don't you care if there's a 9/11 sequel?Besides, American airport security is the ""gold standard,"" isn't it?I encountered these faulty arguments the first and only time I was prodded into a full-body scanner. It was months before the opt-out protest, and the devices were still being tested in only a handful of airports. A friendly TSA agent told me I had nothing to worry about. ""We've all been through them, everyone else is going through them and you won't feel a thing,"" she assured me.Well, if everyone is going through them, then what do I have to worry about?Peer pressure -- the fact that no one else seems to be complaining -- keeps you quiet when your conscience tells you to speak up.Reason #3: you'll miss your planeThe final, and perhaps the most persuasive trick, is the implied threat that if you resist, you'll miss your flight. Unfortunately, it's not an empty threat, and the TSA agent screening you knows it. If a blueshirt believes your attitude is anything less than docile, you could be subjected to a retaliatory wait time.It doesn't help that airlines are unforgiving when their passengers miss a flight -- a ""no-show"" in airline parlance. Often, air travelers either have to pay for a new ticket at an expensive ""walk-up"" fare or get sent to their destination by a less convenient route, missing appointments or a valuable vacation time. No one wants that.Had Burton stopped, asked to speak with a supervisor and filed a report, she would have been threatened with these three possibilities: becoming a poster girl for crazy, being made to feel like a problem passenger or missing her flight.It wasn't an anomaly. On her return flight, TSA agents did exactly the same thing to her.Time to say somethingThis has to end. There's no evidence that patting down passengers like Burton has made air travel any safer. The only thing it's accomplished is to erode a number of constitutional rights we once took for granted, say critics.If invasive, prison-style pat-downs are accepted by air travelers, then who knows what other kinds of searches the TSA might someday try?The agency has ruled out more invasive searches, at least for now. But in a recent poll, one-third of Americans said they would be in favor of cavity searches to board a plane. No, you didn't read that wrong. Cavity searches.The next time a TSA agent asks you to do something you're uncomfortable with, say something. You won't just be helping yourself, but all of the passengers who pass through the checkpoint after you. And if enough passengers speak up, the TSA might stop treating us like inmates when we exercise our constitutional right to travel.It can't happen soon enough.By the way, after you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.

He looked up at me with his little pinkies extended, and clearly, as one might say, ""Hi,"" or ""Bye,"" he said, ""Fuk.""""Excuse me?"" I asked.""Fuk,"" he said. And once again with more emphasis, in case I didn't hear him the first time. ""Fuk!""It was the third time he'd used that word this week, and every time he did, I thought, ""Dammit. The fact that I have a foul mouth has finally come home to roost.""Friends had warned me if I didn't clean up my language, it was going to rub off on my son. Until now, Eddie wasn't old enough to understand what I was saying. It appears that's now changing.I was never one to care about cursing in front of children. Before I had my son, I even resented having to curb my language. I hated the way when we'd visit friends with children, I couldn't get a story out without constantly being interrupted with ""Shuh!"" or ""Achem!"" every time I said a four-letter word. These same friends usually had prohibitions on anyone watching shows like ""Law and Order"" or ""Family Guy"" in their homes because they deemed the language or subject matter to be inappropriate for children.So we all have to suffer? I would think.My husband has even gotten on my case about word choice.""You know he said 'Fuk,' the other day,"" my husband said.""Yeah, I've heard him say that, too. I think he was talking about his 'truck.' I don't know why he calls it that, but he meant 'truck,' "" I said.""Yeah?"" my husband said.""Yeah,"" I said.While using profanity may not be genetic, the idea that it shouldn't be verboten apparently is. My father thought the prohibition on cursing was ridiculous. But more than that, he thought such a prohibition actually encouraged it. To prove his point, he conducted a scientific experiment in our home when I was young. He told me and my brother that under no circumstance could we ever use the word, ""Gherkin."" It was simply forbidden. And don't you know, whenever I felt angry, the first word I would utter was, ""Gherkin!"" When I felt defiant? ""Gherkin!"" Frustrated? ""Gherkin!"" In our house, this miniature pickle was something to be avoided, not because it tasted bad, but because if you said it, you could get your mouth washed out with soap. When the experiment was over and I could use the word ""Gherkin"" as freely as anyone else, I no longer said it, proving his point.Years later, I replaced ""Gherkin"" with any number of George Carlin's ""Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television."" The words weren't just alluring because they were prohibited. When I used them, I seemed to exude toughness, something I didn't feel as a shy youth who was afraid to express her opinions. People seemed to think a girl who uses foul language eats nails for breakfast and can kick your butt, if not physically, then verbally. Nothing says ""strength"" like a string of sewer-mouthed invectives.Of course nothing says ""disrespect"" like a string of sewer-mouthed invectives, and that's what I've finally come to realize. People have strong opinions about cursing. In a crowded room full of chatter, profanity is jarring. It sounds menacing, like shattering glass. When you use it, people form opinions about you that aren't always good, just as they might form an opinion about someone who has a tattoo or a nose ring. And some of the people forming those opinions will be my son's teachers or prospective friends. I figure Eddie's got plenty of time to disenfranchise himself from the people around him. I should at least let him get to second grade before that starts happening.But I know Eddie doesn't have a chance in hell of keeping his mouth clean unless I clean up my own mouth, and I need to do it fast. He's already begun mimicking the things me and my husband do. He's started calling me, ""Scay-bee,"" the pet name my husband and I call each other. He takes tissues out of the tissue box and pretends to blow his nose, because he's seen me do it. He sits briefly on his little training potty, grunts once and then says, ""All done,"" because he watches us. After seeing me put strips of first-aid tape on my chest so that when I go running, my bra doesn't give me an abrasion, Eddie now asks for tape and then places it on his own chest, in the same spots I place mine.My son's daycare is in a church, and when I attended a Zumba class there the other day, I found myself standing next to the daycare's director. I turned to her after a particularly strenuous dance routine, and said, ""Oh my god, my f*cking ankle is killing me!"" As she looked up at me incredulously, I could feel the words float out of my mouth in slow motion the way people describe that moment in a car accident when their vehicle turns 180 degrees before crashing into the guardrail. It seems I need to curb my cursing not just in front of Eddie, but in front of his teachers, lest they think I throw curse words around our home with impunity. Much in life is viewed like the ""Broken Window Theory"": People will think if a parent allows cursing at home, what other dirty, filthy habits will they tolerate?I watched Eddie in his high-chair, and he didn't seem to be eating his bananas. He just sat there staring at them.""Fuk,"" he said again. He then pointed to a drawer of our kitchen cabinet. ""This?"" I said and opened the drawer. ""Fork!"" I took a fork out of the utensil tray and handed it to my son.""Fuk,"" he said, holding up the fork. He then speared one of the bananas and stuck it in his mouth and smiled.I was given a reprieve, but I knew it was only temporary. With Eddie 2, I was going to have to begin training my potty mouth now. Because I hear it only gets more challenging as time goes on.Also on HuffPost:"

Why would you want to tie yourself to someone you are no longer legally bound to? Why would you want that daily reminder that ""hey, things didn't work out, you big failure""?Turns out? I get why people keep their married names now. I'm one of them.Back when I was a freshly engaged, ""my life is just beginning,"" dew-eyed girl of 22, I got into a fairly heated (for us at the time) debate with my soon-to-be husband. I'd always been partial to my maiden name -- I'd had it for 22 years, I'd always gone by it, and I'd never been one of those girls who liked to combine her first name and her crush's last name in swirly script.Not me.I was happy with my maiden name and I didn't really see any need to change it. I didn't want to become Mrs. (Husband's First Name, Husband's Last Name) because it kinda grossed me out. Mrs. So-and-So was my mother-in-law, a matronly woman who taught Christian elementary school.Not me.I was a fresh-eyed girl who had big plans for her future. I'd go back to school after I popped out a few kids, I'd change the world with my research into viruses and bacteria, and I could do it with my very own name. I wasn't Mrs. So-and-So.My husband-to-be disagreed and I could see his point -- it would be obnoxious to have to constantly correct our future children's teachers, doctor's offices, really everyone we knew. And how do you say, ""My name is So-and-So"" without sounding like a bitch?Now I'm staring down the barrels of a divorce and the option of changing my name back to my maiden name (which is my middle name now) seems silly.I've lived as Becky Sherrick Harks for nearly 10 years, and I have no need to go back to my former name. I go by my full name and I like the way it sounds. It's, quite frankly, become part of who I am.And while I've had to change many other things about my life since the ""D"" word was first brought up, my name isn't something I'm planning to give up.Because it turns out? It is me.Would you change your name after a divorce?More from The Stir:The Unfair Secret Trick to Staying MarriedAn Open Letter to My Happily Married FriendsHere's How Much a Divorce REALLY CostsWhat NOT to Say to Your Spouse If You Want to Stay Married (VIDEO) "

As John Gottman has pointed out, Americans have a divorce epidemic on our hands. Grey divorce is on the rise and divorce rates for second and third marriages are high as well. We're obviously doing something wrong when it comes to our relationships. In my opinion, unless there's abuse, turning in your current spouse is not the answer. I'm a firm believer in trying to work things out the first time around, especially if you have children. But if you're already divorced like me (not by choice, in my case), what should you know in order to enhance your odds of success before you remarry? Venker has been studying women and families for over a decade. She's been around the block herself, too. Her first marriage -- with no children -- failed, but she's been happily remarried now for about 15 years with two children. In a recent post that went viral, Venker writes about why women aren't having success in marriage. According to Venker, men feel that their female counterparts just ""aren't women"" anymore. I talked to Suzanne over phone and e-mail to find out more about what that means and what Suzanne thinks women -- in particular divorced women of a certain age -- should do about it. Q. What's key to choosing wisely the next time around?  A. The majority of second marriages that end in divorce do so because of issues regarding stepchildren. Getting divorced and marrying someone else isn't the easy answer it appears to be. I also think what keeps many women from making the right choice the second time is the inability to look in the mirror to see what they did wrong or could have done better. I've read the divorce literature, almost always written by women, and noticed a common theme: blame. The same thing happens in the press whenever there's a Hollywood divorce, too, with the heroine wife hailed as finally free of the loser husband. Blaming one's ex may feel good, at least temporarily, but it's ultimately counterproductive if the goal is to be successful the second time around.Q. That's a sweeping statement. What about victims of infidelity or domestic violence, or women whose husbands were addicts or walked out for no good reason?   A. While most of the divorce literature is blame-oriented, that's not to say there aren't women who get divorced with good reason. But we have to look, unflinchingly, at what's going on with modern women. To suggest all or even most of the women who initiate divorce (about two-thirds) were married to ""bad guys"" and had no choice but to get out is to bury our head in the sand.Women have been taught to view men and marriage in a negative light and often end up creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you enter a marriage thinking it's going to ruin your identity or whatever, that's a very negative attitude you're taking with you. Chances are, you'll get what you expect to get: not much. Q. Why do you think baby boomer women initiate so many divorces?  A. Largely because they can. Since women are living longer than ever and their children are no longer at home, women view this phase of life as a new beginning. Of course, if two people have been miserable for decades and stayed together all those years for the sake of the kids, that's one thing. But if they're just bored or want to see what else is ""out there,"" that's something else.I have an entire chapter in my new book called ""The Green Grass Syndrome."" I think it's human nature to wonder if there's something better ""out there"" than what we have. But the truth is, you'll never get everything you want all wrapped up in one man. There's no reason married people can't be free to live as they wish once their children are gone with one exception: sex. So if sex is the reason baby boomer wives are leaving their marriages, they're going to be disappointed. They'll most certainly find sex with a new person exciting, but in time that will fade and they may very well be left with less of a relationship than they had to begin with. Q. What do you mean by ""free to live as they wish?"" A. I'm just saying it's children, not husbands, that curtail a woman's freedom because of their enormous needs. Parents can't come and go as they please, but married people whose children are gone can live according to their own needs and desires. That's liberation! Q. Let's go back to sex. How do grey divorcees, or any divorcees for that matter, handle sex and dating the second time around? A. In my book, I drive home the point that young women have been sold a bill of goods. Being so aggressive and available to men -- as though the sexes are ""equal"" or ""friends"" -- is not going to get women the love they want. Men like to chase, or ""catch,"" women. If women raise their standards en masse by demanding traditional dating and postponing sexual intercourse until the relationship is established, men would have no choice but to rise to the occasion. I do think the ""rules"" should be somewhat different for, shall we say, more seasoned men and women. But the same general idea still applies.I was talking with a group of women a few weeks ago, and I asked them to imagine eating chicken every night for seven days and then being offered a filet mignon. Yum! When men come across a filet mignon -- a woman they'd like to spend time with and get to know, as opposed to just have sex with -- they know it instantly. The problem today is that there are too many chickens and not enough filet mignons! Q. Your book advises women to leave their office persona at the office once they come home. Is being strong and outspoken a problem for women and are we supposed to just put our core beliefs to the side? A. I would never suggest anyone, male or female, put his or her core beliefs to the side. I'm referring to attitude, tone and style. If you're used to being in charge at work, that doesn't mean your husband wants to be bossed around at home. You have to switch from work mode to married mode.I don't believe men are put off by strong, outspoken women. I wouldn't have found two men willing to marry me if that were the case! But most men are turned off by women who use their power and strength to undermine their guy's masculinity. As clinical psychiatrist Paul Dobransky, M.D., wrote in Psychology Today (in response to my war on men piece at FoxNews.com), ""Men know women are powerful, and we don't mind that one bit. It empowers us that you are empowered. Unless, that is, when you disempower us in order to feel empowered.""Q. So what would I look for in my next husband? A. Someone who values marriage as much as you do, for one. And whose interests are very similar to yours since you're entering a phase of life where marriage is not going to revolve around children. Without the stress of children, a marriage becomes more about the partnership itself, as opposed to being a partnership with parenting thrown into the mix. That's an huge stressor. Q. I have two daughters, approximately college-aged. Would your advice to them be different than your advice to me?   A. My book definitely speaks to your daughters' generation more than yours. They are facing issues you and I didn't, particularly with respect to dating. Dating is defunct. That wasn't the case for you and me. In a broader sense, however, the issues are similar. It was the ""grey divorce"" generation that taught their daughters to ""never depend on a man"" and ""find yourself first"" before getting married. These are modern concepts that became extremely chic. But that doesn't mean they're true. Baby boomers, as a whole, did not provide good role modeling for marriage. Many members of Generations X and Y were also raised in broken homes and thus have no idea what a good marriage looks like. I happen to think divorced people make great mentors for what works and doesn't work in a marriage if they were self-reflective about their own divorce. Q. Any last words? A. I think women need to understand that, more often than not, the power is in their hands. All women, but especially the modern generation, have been groomed for power and independence, not for how to be a wife or how to be married. Thus, woman lack the tools they need to get the marriage they want. I believe my book can help them.But a word of caution: How to Choose a Husband is not your personal overnight guide to getting a ring, nor will it help you find the perfect husband or marriage. I have neither. No one does. It merely offers a whole new way to approach men, marriage and frankly, life."
