We're behind drinking sparkling wine from a can. We are always looking for the best bottle under $20. And we don't blindly follow industry rules on the best ways to aerate wine. While we respect traditions, when it comes to wine all we really care about is that it's good (and preferably without all the pomp and airs). But there are some wine ideas we can't get behind, like when wine is sold in boxes made to look like designer handbags -- that's when it's just gone too far. Available for purchase at Fire Box, the Wine Handbag is for the wine drinker who wants to be discreet and stylish. With a purse filled with wine, we imagine that's not hard to do. You can get the Wine Handbag in three different colors -- to match your outfit, of course -- depending on the type of wine you buy.

The late singer/songwriter was an American legend who helped shape Motown Records in the 1960s and his musical genius was heard around the world. There are few awards that were not bestowed upon Gaye during his short-lived career, and even fewer musicians who aren't greatly influenced by his work. In celebration of what would've been Gaye's 74th birthday (on April 2), we are taking a look back at a vintage photo of the star. In this 1973 snapshot, he is seen relaxing outside of a studio in Los Angeles, and we have to say, we are a little obsessed with his ensemble. His look proves the theory that all an outfit needs is a strong foundation. (What could be more solid than a crisp white T-shirt and the perfect blue jeans?) Gaye accessorized his get-up with distressed boots, red striped socks and a matching hat. This is a prime example of a fashion-forward guy who can teach us a thing or two about style.

5,TRAVEL,A Perfect Day In Sydney: Travel Like A Local,"Ethan Gelber, Contributor

That was only natural; any new foreign resident to any new land undergoes a period of discovery that is both exciting and destabilizing. On the way to feeling like a local, everything is thrillingly new; everything is also disruptively new.A general sense of deracination notwithstanding, I was very lucky to have a strong leader as I got my bearings. Shortly before arriving in Australia, I had married a lovely Sydneysider named Jane and was counting on all her home-field advantages to help me find my footing. I predictably got more than I bargained for. Not only did she translate sometimes harder-to-understand-than-expected Strine, she brought to life for me a city with far more than meets the eye. Which says a lot, because there's already plenty to see.Sydney revealed more and more of its character to me through a very slow drip, as one would expect from any great urban centre. In keeping with its structure -- it is more an assembly of discrete suburbs, each with its own (often banner-held-high) reputation, than it is a metropolis with a blend of neighborhoods -- I stumbled across its treats and its treasures one trove at a time.It must be said that I was aided by my choice of transport. I have never owned a car, preferring both the liberation and limitations of travel by bicycle. Fortunately, Sydney is pretty bike-friendly. While not without its challenges for two-wheelers -- hilly terrain, confusing one-way streets, huge and dangerous thoroughfares, aggressive drivers -- it has a far-reaching network of bike routes, a weighty and outspoken body of devoted pedal-commuters, and a temperate and mostly saddle-suitable climate. Of Sydney I therefore saw a whole lot more than many people do simply because I was moving around in a way that made it easy for me to stop and explore.Regardless, against my better judgment and ever lamenting all that I knew I didn't know, I inevitably eased into a routine that became familiar if never quite comfortable. And then, after five years and the births of our two children, we moved to my native New York City.So in homage to our home away from home in the land Down Under, this is a fond remembrance of Sydney, informed almost entirely by what I learned from Jane, who paved the way for me there and loved qualities of it that I learned to love on my own. We may not live in Sydney now, but our hearts remain with it, split between frustrating antipodal allegiances and affections.Jane's Perfect Day in Sydney We wake up late to a bright summer sun over Darlington. We have ample time for coffee and brunch at Cafe Ella, a focal-point local eatery popular with university students. Most of it consumed by an extension of The University of Sydney campus, Darlington is a small suburb, its limited name cache and low profile something the locals love, especially in contrast to neighboring Chippendale, Newtown and Redfern.By the time our appetites are sated, it's starting to warm up. We make a quick detour to pick up picnic materials at the weekend market near Carriageworks, the lively and always-worth-a-visit multi-venue arts and performance centre set in the suburb's old, repurposed rail yard. Provisioned, we hop on our bikes (although it's an easy trip by train or bus too) and cruise off to Sydney's central business district, or CBD.We dismount at Hyde Park, the oldest public parkland in Australia, and then walk the length of Central Avenue, a lane shaded by the enmeshed canopies of towering fig trees, some more than 80 feet tall. At the far north end, we pause in the refreshing mist of the Archibald Fountain, where giant bronze mythological figures gaze at the surrounding city.At the heart of Sydney, this fountain is a perfect departure point for pretty much any of the central city's attractions. Today our chosen destination is the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Free admission to its air-conditioning and large permanent collection makes it a perfect, cool and cultured retreat. Jane's favorite rooms are the subdued Asian galleries, where shining buddhas, bodhisattvas and other gods and goddesses peer stolidly through dim light. We can't leave without checking what the special exhibits are and taking in the lower level's impressive Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander Collection in the Yirbana Gallery.Back out in the summer heat, we head for relief: it's time for a swim. A short pedal away is Andrew (Boy) Charlton pool, which almost always has us convinced that we're swimming right in Sydney Harbour -- without any boats to dodge.Feeling energized after our aquatic exertions, we head west. In season, the entrance to Sydney's nighttime open-air cinema is right here, which is something we keep in mind for later. For now, though, we're right at the doorstep of Sydney's phenomenal Royal Botanical Gardens. We head straight to the Fernery, an oasis of extra-green within an oasis of green.Pangs of hunger don't let us linger so we push to the gardens' Farm Cove waterfront, where we find a shady spot for our picnic and resist the temptation to feed the bold free-ranging ibis and marauding seabirds. Within sight of Bennelong Point and its world-famous Sydney Opera House, we follow the coast that way around on our way to Sydney Cove. Here, at the Circular Quay travel nexus, the ever-lively street scene is a commotion of performers, tourists and commuters dashing for the ferries that reach all across Sydney Harbour.We pause for a gelato and stand still amid the hubbub. We look at the posted ferry departure times and destinations and make a spur-of-the-moment decision to leap aboard one bound for Cockatoo Island, a fascinating former penal settlement and shipbuilding centre right in the middle of the harbor. We decide instead to alight much further east, at Watson's Bay, Australia's oldest fishing village, located on the southern head of the entrance to the harbor.From the Watson's Bay wharf, we take a walking path past Camp Cove and Lady Bay (a nude beach) to the striped Hornby Lighthouse at South Head and then make our way back to Doyles Restaurant's takeaway fish-and-chip outlet. We tote our dinner haul to the nearby park and watch the sunset to the squawk of hungry seagulls."
6,WEDDINGS,What's Audrey Hepburn's Advice For Today's Bride?,"G.E. Masana, Contributor

That would be the Number One thing.,2013-04-02,"In this image released by Paramount Pictures, Audrey Hepburn is shown in a scene from ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Memorable movies, including ""Breakfast at Tiffanyￂﾒs,"" ""Dirty Harry,"" ""A League of Their Own"" and ""The Matrix"" are being preserved for their enduring significance in American culture as The Library of Congress announces, Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2012, the slate of films it will induct into the National Film Registry.(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) ** NO SALES **",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfe0d2200008300d974a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Now with ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" opening on Broadway, the character of Holly Golightly is once again on the minds of women everywhere. And so is legendary movie star Audrey Hepburn, who brought Holly to life in the iconic 1961 film version.In fact, Ms. Hepburn's influence as a role model -- and style goddess -- hasn't faded in some 50 years. As the embodiment of a modern woman with grace, elegance and style, many women today have grown up with a movie poster of Hepburn hanging in their bedroom.As a wedding photographer, especially being in NYC, brides often tell me how they admire Audrey Hepburn, describing her as irresistible. Beautiful. Classic. Strong. Noble. And always stylish.Sadly, she passed away in 1993. So I wonder:What would Audrey do -- if she were a bride planning her wedding today?For the answer I turned to Pamela Keogh, author of ""What Would Audrey Do?"" which looks at lessons drawn directly from Ms. Hepburn's life, a life where she overcame hardships such as abandonment by her father at the age of six, then escaping Nazi-occupied Holland, yet turning all obstacles into strengths along the way.Pamela, I should ask first, what made you write ""What Would Audrey Do""?My first book was a book about Audrey's style, a really big authorized 70,000 word biography with a lot of photos people had never seen and I just wanted to do a lighter fun sort of a book about Audrey and her life and what we could learn from that today.And what would that be? What made Audrey Hepburn the icon she is today?I think with Audrey, and you see this in a lot of fascinating people, Audrey's style came from who she was. There wasn't any disconnect.Her style came from her history, from her experiences as a young girl during World War II when the Nazis invaded. It came from her intelligence, from her courage, her vulnerability. So it wasn't like she was created by a stylist or by some Hollywood person telling her what to wear. It really works that her style is so authentic, literally coming out of her life and who she was.When I wrote the book I interviewed Gregory Peck [her co-star in her first American movie ""Roman Holiday"" and for which she won an Academy Award] and you see the same exact thing: he was who he represented on the screen. What you saw was who he was. There was honesty. They weren't ""made up.""Now you look at the Kardashians or Paris Hilton and you get a sense they're manufactured pastiches of what celebrities should be.So when it comes to weddings, do you think shows like ""Bridezilla"" popularize a version of a cruder bride?I think it's not so much ""popularizing"" but ""acceptance."" In the old days, back in the 1940's and 1950's men did not walk out of a house without wearing a hat and women were considered properly dressed by having gloves on. There was an aspiration to try and better yourself. You wanted to improve yourself.Whereas now, perhaps not what the typical person does, but on television, there's a popularization of this awful, crass, ridiculous behavior. An example is ""Jersey Shore."" They act like buffoons but people don't really act that way. Only clowns act that way.Is that influencing people to imitate their behavior and steer away from earlier role models?Cool people doing cool stuff, educated, contributing to society, doing good things, helping out kids, whatever they're doing -- they're still there. They don't even know the Kardashians exist.The problem is the people who aren't doing good things, well, they may be clownish.So here's the big question: What would Audrey do if she were a bride planning her wedding today?Most of all, and probably most important of all, Audrey would do whatever she wanted to do on her wedding day. That would be the Number One thing.You know she was married twice, though unfortunately both marriages didn't work out. But the weddings themselves were very beautiful occasions.Both her weddings weren't big extravaganzas. They were very intimate affairs. She was a very private person. And each time she was a world famous movie star but she didn't want the attention of the press.Givenchy designed her first wedding dress, the material, a silk, was gorgeous. But this, like her wedding, was a reflection of who she was. They were a continuation of her style, which was the way she presented herself to the world.So then, what's the biggest thing to take away from this?Well, this is the number one thing, and it's to ""know oneself."" Know what works for you. Don't listen to a wedding planner. Don't listen to your mother. Or your mother-in-law. And since I've never known any husband who got involved at all at any wedding at any level, it doesn't matter what he wants. It's your day. Do what you want. And get what you want. Have a vision in your mind and follow through.Maybe you love flowers but really don't know what a great flower arrangement should look like, so you get a florist in to help you. The most important thing is that the wedding day be a reflection of who you are and what you want.Some brides want a big wedding, others want a small wedding. Again, it should be a reflection of what she wants and who she is as a person.And it should also be a reflection of the love between the couple.That leaves the question, if Audrey's the bride's role model, who's the role model for the groom?Oh! Cary Grant! Or Gregory Peck!But my final thoughts for the bride would be: you've been expecting this day for a while. You're beautiful! Relax, have fun, enjoy yourself. Be like Audrey -- and shine. You're the star that day."

9,HOME & LIVING,An Open Letter To Everyone Selling Furniture On Craigslist,"Brie Dyas, Contributor
On Assignment For HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/open-letter-to-craigslist_us_5b9cfdf4e4b03a1dcc8396f6,"Craigslist's furniture category has really just become an overpriced graveyard for Ikea furniture, where everything is ""vintage."" If you even think about selling, I'd like a word with you.",2013-04-02,Antique Chairs on a table at flea market of Tel-Aviv,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfdf41f000050002170be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Selling on Craigslist? I'd like to have a word with you.I get it. It's hard to part with the stuff we collect in the day-to-day life, especially if you're one to hold on to (read: hoard) anything vintage. Or, if you knew you paid a few hundred (or even over a grand) for that sofa in your living room. But clutter can mean cash, so away to Craigslist you go. No problem there.But the thing is...your stuff, nine out of ten times, isn't worth as much as you think. For instance, that floral sofa bed set that has been with you since the first Bush administration. It is worth far, far less than, say, $190.Seriously. Ask yourself: If I moseyed into Pottery Barn (or even Raymour & Flanigan) would I pay that much for that aged floral print fabric? No. I don't think you'd even accept it for free. Which is why you're selling it on Craigslist.And don't get me started on finding Ikea furniture. It's everywhere. Craigslist's furniture category should just be called ""Secondhand Ikea."" First of all, no one *really* wants Ikea furniture. Usually it's a compromise or the panicked buy at the last minute. Sure, there are really cute things there now. But we all know that the stuff chips faster than the rarest of Victorian dolls. And after the crazed trip (battling through hundreds of families who treat Ikea as a viable form of entertainment), the assembly process and the inevitable exchange, paying $50 for a new Ikea table starts to seem a little steep, no? So why do you honestly think someone will spend $50 after it's been in your house for years? Or that they would want to give you $270 for the privilege of taking an Ikea couch that, statistically, you've probably spent at least three sick days on? Especially if it appears to be velvet? I mean, I'm still regretting spending $500 on a ""starter"" sofa from Ikea that lasted me five years before the arm inexplicably departed from its frame. The polyester cushions have since reconfigured into some sort of interactive art piece. Yet I wouldn't expect anyone to buy it off of me. In fact, I would pay somebody to take it away from my house. But what's that, you say? You indeed have rare and priceless antiques, just hanging out in your home?Nope, you don't. You just have a small cabinet from 30 years ago that you'd like to receive $525 for. 30 years ago, it was 1983. There was nothing that came out of the furniture design realm that would be worthy of that amount, in 1983. Unless Michael Jackson danced on top of it in the 'Thriller' video. And even then, its worth is debatable. While we're at it, let's discuss the use of the word ""vintage,"" which peppers the Craigslist furniture listings like a form of Tourette's. Instead of describing an item that's over 30 years old and stylish enough to be desirable, the term has now become a catch-all for anything dusty and unwanted. It could have been purchased at Urban Outfitters last week. Now it's ""vintage.""So let's be real. Furniture loses value immediately. You know how they say that a new car loses half its value when you drive it off the lot? It's worse for furniture. Once it's in your home, you'd be lucky to one day get $20 for the thing. (Unless it is honest-to-God midcentury modern, where well-meaning people will line up to buy it, blog about it and then sell it once they have children, repeating the cycle.) Most furniture today is little more than overpriced fake wood configured in whatever style most people would find appealing. And most old junk is exactly that...old junk. There's also the unavoidable fact that it's been in your house, collecting stains and crumbs. And no one knows if you've been lounging around in the nude on the sofa or chair in question. Think about that the next time you put your stuff up for sale.To see really strange Craigslist ads, check out HuffPost Home's slideshow below.Have something to say?

Jobs Council members, administration officials and Silicon Valley leaders spoke with entrepreneurs about how public and private sectors can partner to create jobs through innovation.

Many years later, she became the COO of Facebook and I became a stay-at-home father (and part-time writer). Stuff happens. But, since I now have two tween daughters, I read her Lean In with them in mind. For the most part, I remained part of the inspired choir she's preaching to about the need for a culture more conducive to women's ambition for leadership. A few passages, however, left me troubled and even sad.  First, the sadness. Early in the book, Sandberg reveals that even though she was voted ""Most Likely to Succeed"" in high school, she did the unthinkable: She convinced a friend on the yearbook staff to remove her name to avoid taking ""any chances with the prom."" What?! It's so sad to read about self-sabotage in the name of dating. When I was honored with the title, I did not become a megalomaniac (as least as I remember it), but it was nice to be recognized. (Little did I know it would complicate my conversations at our reunions.)  A key strength of the book, however, is precisely this type of admission from an accomplished, unlikely source, which could teach girls important lessons. Indeed, the confession fits in nicely with the chapter I most endorse titled, ""Don't Leave Before You Leave,"" which begins with a funny -- but also sad -- story of a young woman at Facebook who was already asking work/family balance questions before she even had a boyfriend! Sandberg's advice is counterintuitive, but right: ""The time to scale back is when a break is needed or when a child arrives -- not before, and certainly not years in advance."" Allow me an ""Amen"" from the choir. Upon reading this, I realized I had followed this advice unconsciously, mainly because I was culturally conditioned as a man, but hopefully, future at-home mothers will follow it as well. My career trajectory after high school was clear: college, graduate school and a Ph. D. in American literature. Even though I met my wife in college, we thought very little about future kids and very much leaned into our career paths.   It was only when we became serious about starting a family that I started to weigh our financial future and childcare options. Eventually, I quit my job teaching at the University of Michigan, but I'm grateful I didn't lean out of my career path until a few years after I earned the terminal degree. Sandberg states that ""women rarely make one big decision to leave the workforce,"" but basically I did, and I'd recommend it to all young men and women fortunate enough to be able to consider at-home parenthood.   The key reason is that life today is far too uncertain to make oneself financially vulnerable until it is absolutely necessary. Any parent who takes over at-home parenting (even just part-time) has to worry a bit about the three-headed monster of potential divorce, widow(er)hood or a spouse/partner's job loss. (Feel free to picture me lecturing my daughters at this point, complete with eyerolls.) As my own former stay-at-home mother kept saying to me, ""At least you have your degree in case anything happens."" My wife often rolled her eyes at that one, but I now understand my mother's parenting version of ""hope for the best but prepare for the worst.""  Sandberg adds the valuable point that leaning into your career just before leaning out also gives you more leverage when it's time to re-enter the workforce. This is not to say one should deceive a future employer if one is about to quit. And yes, placement committees might take issue with this type of advice, but scaling back your professional plans does not necessarily mean you will never use your credentials again.   And now for my trouble with Sandberg's book, which is her dating advice. She advises women to date ""all"" the boys when looking for a worthy partner: ""the bad boys, the cool boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys."" Excuse me? I know she says don't marry the crazies, but I would have preferred she take the advice Eric Schmidt at Google gave her about how to choose the best careers and apply it to how to choose the best dates: ""potential for growth."" While a young woman is dating the crazies, she could be missing out on Mr. Potential for Growth!   Fortunately, Sandberg concludes her dating advice by recommending women find someone ""who wants an equal partner."" She even claims that domestically supportive men become sexier over time, citing a book called Porn for Women that shows scenes of men cleaning the kitchen and tending to the baby. Now I have fodder for the next reunion: Perhaps I should have been voted Most Likely to Become a Porn Star?   Late in the book, Sandberg provides an inspiring look to future generations: ""The homes we create tend to be more rooted in our childhoods."" Again, amen. This concept struck home for me when my wife, my 12-year-old daughter and I happened upon the ""Makers: Women Who Make America"" series on PBS. As each woman told her story, I couldn't help noticing what we were doing during the show: I was folding laundry, my wife was on the phone with the hospital and most significantly, my daughter was oblivious to both our activities. The show mentioned the subject of ""women's work,"" and I had to remind myself that my daughters think ""women's work"" involves performing laser surgery and running staff meetings. (My daughter also didn't understand the bra-burning scene, but I let her mother handle that one.)  As a stay-at-home father, I have ""leaned way in"" to my family, and it was the right arrangement for us. But I always try to remind myself of the luxury of my choice and remain grateful for my, yes, different kind of success. As Sandberg notes, however, there are many obstacles in an at-home dad's path, especially at the beginning. Her chapter on the need for more mentors for women with leadership ambitions reads like a mirror image of the need for more mentors for men with domestic ambitions. My first year as an at-home father with a colicky baby was especially difficult, but outlets like a local Early Childhood PTA (full of welcoming moms, thankfully) and later, a small dads' group I organized in my area became invaluable. For anyone in a similar situation, I recommend finding/creating such groups for support, as well as visiting the websites for larger organizations like the National At-Home Dad Network and the New York City Dads Group. I agree with Sandberg: We need to make both men and women more likely to succeed, whatever their professional or domestic ambitions."

AFP PHOTO MARION BERARD (Photo credit should read MARION BERARD/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfaa52000003100fdc9d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've just ended an epic battle with a two-week long cold. Typically, this wouldn't be a thing of note, however, I have a storied history with strep throat and my condition was such that I was prime for infection. Under ordinary circumstances strep throat wouldn't be a thing of note, however, I am currently living in France where healthcare works a little differently than in the United States.Strep throat and I are old pals, and in the past it hasn't been unusual for us to reconnect every six months or so. Generally it occurs after a cold, after a week of little sleep, or after any other set of circumstances that leave my immune system in a general state of disrepair. The pain in my throat will linger long past all other symptoms: no redness, no swelling, no fever, spots, or bumps. More than once, dubious doctors have been proved wrong in 15 minutes by a positive Rapid Strep Test (backed up by a standard two-day culture). Antibiotics are ultimately prescribed and a week later I'm back on track. It's a simple process I know well and take seriously because although no one wants to be living with strep throat, I also have guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis is a skin disease (the trendiest of skin diseases!) where small pink, scaly lesions appear on the skin, and outbreaks of which are primarily triggered by a streptococcal infection, among other things such as stress and skin injury. The anxiety caused by the possibility of an outbreak alone is enough to trigger an outbreak. So last week I had my French host mother book me an appointment with the local doctor as soon as my sore throat failed to subside.Speaking a melange of French and English I tried to ask the doctor for the RST. ""Le test? L'examen pour les streptocoques?"" My inquiry was met with confusion. He asked me what I usually do when I have les streptocoques and I told him I take antibiotics. He vehemently denied me the antibiotics I wasn't even asking for, then told me my throat wasn't red and shooed me out of his office with a prescription for Ibuprofen. Later in the car with my French host mother I explained the RST in English and learned that such a simple and routine procedure does not exist in France. What is this tomfoolery?As cultural differences is a favorite topic of mine, two days later I relayed my ordeal to a French friend. He astutely pointed out that while I may think it's insane that such a basic healthcare practice doesn't exist here, he thinks it's insane that the infection is such a ubiquitous issue in the United States that the practice is a necessity. An outbreak of strep throat is so rare in France it's practically newsworthy he said to me. My initial incredulous reaction began to change shape-- perhaps my irritation with this foreign health system that can't cater to my medical needs should be redirected home to Antiseptic America. Growing up I would often hear my nurse mother complain of the parents who bring their sniffling children to the doctors and the doctors who then dole out antibiotics to shut up the sniveling parents. Overuse of antibiotics in America is no myth and the ""hygiene hypothesis,"" which proposes that increased cleanliness and hygiene has decreased our exposure to infectious microbes and parasites and thus suppresses the natural development of our immune systems, is not a new theory. I can't help but wonder if the HH is less theory and more fact. Americans have a reputation for over-washing, over-sanitizing, and over-prescribing and although it's possible my personal experience with sickness in a foreign country is a result of my own weak immune system and not that of an underlying cultural issue, evidence suggests otherwise. Scientifically speaking of course, I, and many of my American cohorts, seem to get sick a lot abroad. And my French dishwasher's capabilities are questionable. But I'm not pointing any fingers. One can't be sure of the origins of the American notion of ""dirty Europeans"" but maybe a little dirt isn't such a bad thing if it makes one less susceptible to bad things. I still don't know if I had strep throat or not but I did what any American would do: doctor shopped and got a prescription for antibiotics.For more by Carrie Dennis, click here.

Armstrong Roberts/Retrofile/Getty Imag",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf89e1f00002c00216e98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We've all heard the phrase ""opposites attract."" But what happens when that happy union of opposites starts to rub you the wrong way? At my Soul Blazing Sanctuary, I often work with couples where one person is very intellectual and not interested in social activities, while the other person is quite the opposite -- very social and not considered intellectually gifted. Sometimes the differences don't matter and the couple manages to make it work. But more often than not, these specific opposite tendencies create stress, frustration, and feelings of inadequacy in at least one of the partners. For example, Bill and Patricia (not their real names) recently came to me for help. Bill likes to go out with his friends who are intellectually his equal. He says that his wife is more of a ""simple"" person who can't talk at his level and engage in intellectually-stimulating conversation. While Patricia is indeed smart, she prefers reading about fashion, food, and the latest celebrity gossip instead of the philosophy books Bill reads. Whenever Bill mentions his friends, he often throws in phrases like, ""You couldn't possibly understand our conversations."" That's when her buttons get pushed. His words and actions make her feel that she's not good enough. Instinctively, she retaliates by saying derogatory things to him, which causes him to leave and go out with his intellectually-gifted friends. The next day they make up, and a few days later the cycle repeats.Fortunately for couples like Bill and Patricia, it doesn't have to be this way. You can blend smart and social and make the relationship work. Here's how.• Aim for Acceptance, Not DominanceFirst, realize that it's not about determining which personality tendency is ""better"" than the other, and then forcing the other person to change. Neither tendency ""wins"" in life. Being intellectual has advantages, as does being socially-oriented. Rather, it's about accepting each other for who the person is, because you each are unique individuals. Remember, no matter how hard you try, you can't change another person. • Know Yourself If the differences between you and your partner are straining your relationship, get clear on what you can do to calm yourself. When the other person ""pushes your buttons,"" how can you temper your reactions? I'm not suggesting you hide or ignore your feelings. Rather, I'm suggesting that you know what steps you can consciously choose to take to not let the other person's words or actions set you off. Does going out for a walk help? Journaling? Doing yoga? Figure out what helps you feel at ease so you don't erupt every time your partner irritates you.• Focus on the PositiveGet in touch with your strengths and what you offer to the relationship. If you're not sure, ask your partner to tell you what they love about you, what attracted them to you, what they find desirable in you. Then, do the same for your partner. What strengths does he or she have that you like? Put your focus on these areas of your relationship -- on the strengths rather than on the differences. • Like YourselfUsually, when you start picking on others and focusing on their flaws and differences, it's because you're not happy with yourself. When you don't feel secure with who you are, it's easy to emotionally bully others by putting them down or fighting with them. So after creating your list of positive qualities, re-read them and think of examples in your life where you've exemplified the positive traits. Embrace the positive feelings that come with those memories so you can ""fall in love"" with yourself and all you have to offer to the relationship.• Gain Understanding About What Your Partner LikesEven if you don't like something, you can still appreciate it. For example, suppose your intellectual partner loves to go to the ballet or the opera. You may find these outings boring. To make it more interesting, learn about the origins of a certain opera or ballet you'll be attending. Also, read a few books about well known ballerinas or opera singers. The struggles and sacrifices these people made for their art may move you. At the very least, you'll gain an appreciation for what your partner enjoys, which will make attending the show with him or her more enjoyable. Likewise, if you hate socializing at mainstream events, find one thing your partner likes to do (perhaps cooking) and take a class together that focuses on the activity. Meet the other people in the class and learn about what got them involved in the activity and what they love about it. Since most classes are small, this is a good place to start ""breaking the ice"" with regular people who share an interest that your partner has. For both of these scenarios, remember that you're doing it for the relationship, so go in with an open mind. After some time, you may even develop a new interest in the topic or activity and realize that the two of you have more in common than you initially thought. Happily Ever AfterUltimately, you chose your partner for a reason. You have a soul-level connection that can transcend any differences. Hold strong to that fact and you'll soon find that smarts and social can indeed go hand-in-hand in any relationship.For more by Lisa Haisha, click here.For more on relationships, click here."
