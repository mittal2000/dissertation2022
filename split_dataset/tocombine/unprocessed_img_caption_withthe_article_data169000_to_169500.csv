0,WELLNESS,The Newtown Shootings: Mourning the Loss of Children Taken So Suddenly Away,"Peter R. Breggin M.D., Contributor
Peter R. Breggin, MD, has been called “The Conscience of Psych...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newtown-shootings_us_5b9ca083e4b03a1dcc80699a,"We don't necessarily ""recover."" We may never ""get over it.""  Instead, we may wrap ourselves in the wisdom gained from loss. We may learn that life means even more to us than we realized before our loved one was taken away.",2012-12-16,"A couple of volunteer firefighters place flowers at a makeshift memorial at a sign for the Sandy Hook Elementary school, Saturday, Dec. 15, 2012 in Sandy Hook village of Newtown, Conn. The massacre of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary school elicited horror and soul-searching around the world even as it raised more basic questions about why the gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, would have been driven to such a crime and how he chose his victims. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca0833c00004c0009d5af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Children are about hope. Children are about our many hopes for them and for ourselves. We give these fragile beings all of our love, hoping and believing that they will grow with that love and then spread the gift to others.We look at the mistakes our own parents made and vow to do better and to provide our children the best possible family life. We look at the suffering we endured as children, perhaps from poverty, from family conflict, from bullying, from failing to accomplish, and then we do everything we can to make their way easier.We look at the opportunities we had, or didn't have, growing up and work hard to make sure that our children's lives will offer them even better and more-varied choices. When times are difficult for us, we try not to let our own frustrations spill over onto our children. We try to be the best parents we can so that our children will have the best of us upon which to build their own lives.There are conflicts and difficulties, of course, as we bring up our children, but there are also moments that seemed bathed in grace when our children shine like angels in our lives, and other moments after seeing them work so hard to achieve, that we bask in their success, knowing we helped to make it possible. And then there is the quiet, ever-present sense of satisfaction we achieve from day to day from simply knowing that they exist.Sometimes our children seem so much a part of us, and our hopes, that it can be difficult to know when and where they begin as individuals and when and where our hope for ourselves becomes more purely hope for them, for their lives, and their future families.So what, then, are we to do when our children, one or more, are taken from us in one horrible instant that dashes all of our hopes? And what about the slower, sometimes more torturous tragedies we endure as parents? The unexpected traumatic loss of a child at the hands of a murderer or a drunk driver is among the most unendurable losses, but it is not the only kind. There is the loss of watching our children become estranged from us through marital conflict and divorce that has spun out of control. There is the loss in witnessing our children sink into drug abuse and addiction, or profound emotional distress, dragging them beyond our reach.There is chronic illness that afflicts our child and breaks our heart. There is seemingly-inexplicable conflict that creates rifts between us and our children, conflicts that we cannot seem to heal no matter how we try.The loss of a child is the loss of a part of ourselves, and especially that part of us from which hope springs eternal. It faces us with the knowledge that hope may not spring eternally -- at least not in our lives and lifetimes. I don't have any answers. But I do have a direction: to revive hope, to love again, and to reconnect with the eternal in ourselves, our children, and our loved ones. We don't necessarily ""recover."" We may never ""get over it."" Instead, we may wrap ourselves in the wisdom gained from loss. We may learn that life means even more to us than we realized before our loved one was taken away. We may learn to treasure life in a deeper way, bathed in the knowledge that loved ones can never be taken for granted. We may be sustained by accepting that we never do stop loving, even when our loved ones are removed from sight, because love persists beyond loss. In this knowledge that love transcends loss, we can find continued strength to love. It is because of love that hope can spring eternal. It's at all times a fragile effort, but it's what we're supposed to do.   Peter R.

(Photo by Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb40d5a260000e900823fe6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While The Hobbit, Peter Jackson's prequel to his Tolkien-inspired Lord of the Rings series, leads the box office charts, the New Zealand director was in town last week for its premiere, but that was not the only film he has opening. The next night, he introduced his film of passion, West of Memphis, the documentary he and partner Fran Walsh produced and funded themselves, a cause célèbre in the United States revisiting the murder of three 8-year-olds in 1993, and the three teens, Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley, who went to jail for the crime. Amy Berg directs the documentary feature, focusing on the case of the only West Memphis Three (WM3) on death row, Damien Echols, who with his wife Lorri Davis, also produced West of Memphis. While Damien Echols acknowledged Peter Jackson for saving his life, all agree, this film and Echols' story would not be known if not for the decades-in-the-making trilogy, that covered the case as it was evolving, Paradise Lost, produced for HBO by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky.Here is how it all began: In 1993, a newspaper item about the murder of three 8-year-olds in West Memphis and the three teenaged boys arrested for the crime piqued the interest of HBO's Sheila Nevins. She called the filmmaking team of Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, sending them south to document the case. The filmmakers thought they were going to tell a tale about guilty teens and Satanic rituals in the heartland. Finding the evidence overwhelming that the men were innocent, instead they made a movie that pointed toward a miscarriage of justice.Paradise Lost 1: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills and 2: Revelations Galvanized Support for the Convicted Young Men. A website was set up. A Brooklyn based architect, Lorri Davis, left her job to work on the release of Damien Echols, ending up married to him. A celebrity following: Eddie Vedder, Johnny Depp, Patti Smith, and Peter Jackson came on board, giving the case further visibilityAfter 18 years in prison, the men were released in August, 2011, a bittersweet ending. The West Memphis Three had to plead guilty to the crime under a legal catch-22 called the Alford Plea. Innocent, they also had to sign documents saying they would not prosecute the state of Arkansas for wrongfully imprisoning them. Jason Baldwin did not want to comply, but then realizing that Damien Echols could be executed before the case could be retried with new DNA evidence, he saw the importance of essentially playing along with an untruth. Many say that Jason Baldwin's decision saved his friend's life.In the celebration of their release, one truth is overlooked: the case of three little boys murdered in West Memphis in 1993 remains cold, even though by the end of the Paradise Lost Trilogy: Purgatory, and in West of Memphis, to open on Christmas day, a glaring light shines on Terry Hobbes, a murdered boy's stepfather.After West of Memphis screened at the French Institute, actors Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan, and an artist who inks Echols, gathered around him, congratulating this freed man on the film and his new book, Life After Death, optioned by Johnny Depp. Echols lives with his wife in Salem, Massachusetts when they are not traveling. He does not see Jason or Jesse, as they did not have contact over the 18 years they were wrongly jailed and did not stay in touch.Peter Jackson says West of Memphis doesn't have much to do with the other boys because Jackson ""was always on Damien's defense team. They all have different defense teams."" As a New Zealander looking at the American system of justice, he noted that American officials are elected. ""They want to keep their jobs so their sense of justice is biased."" On this case, ""It is unlikely that someone will do the right thing and pursue the truth of the murders. It is in no one's interest to do so.""In addition to the documentaries, a fiction film by Atom Egoyan is in the works. Alessandro Nivola, so fine as Elle Fanning's father in Sally Potter's gem, Ginger and Rosa, plays Terry Hobbes. The real Terry Hobbes is laying low, working in a hardware store, even though, as Lorri Davis put it, ""No one is interested in dealing with 'the Hobbes family secret.'""Says Joe Berlinger on the occasion of the release of the Paradise Lost boxed set, the WM3's ultimate lesson is the utter immorality of the death penalty, but not from the old debate centered on, does the state have the right to kill? ""The justice system is run by human beings who may allow self-interest to get in the way of the truth. There is never a justification for killing an innocent person.""A version of this post also appears on Gossip Central."

Brandon Marshall’s production: Keep an eye on Marshall’s pre-snap alignments. The Bears will use Marshall as the Z, the X, in the slot, out of stack, etc. A variety of alignments designed to create a matchup for Jay Cutler’s No.1 target. Think of the short to intermediate route tree with inside breaking cuts. That’s Marshall’s game because of his size and leverage. The Packers limited the WR in their Week 2 win playing 2-Man in the secondary and I would expect to see some more man-under until this Bears’ offense can make some plays.2. Packers’ run game vs. Cover 2: The Bears are going to play Cover 2 vs. Aaron Rodgers. But considering the production this offense showed running the football on Sunday night in the win over Detroit, let’s see if the Bears can stop Green, Harris and Grant with a 7-man box. Because if Green Bay can force Lovie Smith’s defense to walk a safety down into the front (Cover 1, Cover 3), Rodgers will have some opportunities outside of the numbers vs. CBs Charles Tillman and Kelvin Hayden with a single high safety in the middle of the field.3. Randall Cobb inside of the numbers: I’m excited to check out the second-year pro on Sunday after watching him on tape this week. On top of his lateral ability in the open field, Cobb is smooth out of his cuts and has a nice burst to the ball. Don’t be surprised to see him aligned as the No.2 or No.3 where he can run the underneath Hi-Lo concepts, the deep crossing routes and work the intermediate cuts vs. zone coverage. And let’s not forget about 3rd and 2-6 situations, because the quick option route can move the sticks. As I broke down in the Chicago Tribune last night, Cobb can be a matchup issue for this Bears’ defense.4. Cutler’s ability to protect the ball: The Bears haven’t had an answer for Dom Capers’ defensive game plan and that leads to Cutler forcing throws vs. pressure. Can’t turn the ball over and put your defense in an adverse situation. The Bears have to get Matt Forte involved early on Sunday, stay ahead of the sticks and prevent the QB from having to make a play in 3rd and 7-plus situations. And if the Packers try to take away Marshall, look for rookie WR Alshon Jeffery. Someone has to emerge opposite the No.1 WR to make some plays for the QB who comes into this game with some injuries.5. Nick Roach’s eye discipline: With Brian Urlacher still out with a hamstring issue, Roach gets his second start at the Mike Backer position. But was he really tested vs. Ponder and the Vikings? I didn’t see it. Roach will have to be sound in his run-pass keys and match speed down the field. However, it starts with the LB's ability to read through play action and get depth in his drop. Can’t look in the backfield and vacate the middle of the field vs. Rodgers. That’s trouble.Follow me on Twitter: @MattBowen41"

11,WELLNESS,Psychological Effects Of Connecticut Shooting: 'You're Looking At A Lot of Trauma',Saki Knafo and Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/psychological-effects-connecticut-shooting_us_5b9ca058e4b03a1dcc8066ab,"When Peggy Lindholm heard about the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., on Friday, she thought back to April 20, 1999, when",2012-12-15,"In this photo provided by the Newtown Bee, Connecticut State Police lead a line of children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. on Friday, Dec. 14, 2012 after a shooting at the school.

Lindholm's daughter, Margorie, survived the massacre at Columbine High School that day, but couldn't set foot in a classroom for years afterward. She struggled with depression and addictions. Her mother went on to work as a licensed counselor for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Something like this does a lot of things to your mind,"" Peggy Lindholm said. Although the news of the latest school massacre is still fresh, psychologists and experts in child development have already begun drawing conclusions about the psychological toll that the shooting might take on survivors. Lindholm boiled it down to this: ""You're looking at a lot of trauma."" Russell T. Jones, a clinical psychologist and psychology professor at Virginia Tech, has studied and worked extensively with traumatized children, and he said the Newtown massacre is likely to have a long-lasting impact on the kids who survived it. ""They're likely to have difficulty concentrating, difficulty with trust, difficulty with dealing with the losses they've incurred,"" Jones said. ""Many of these kids will never be the same kids.""Jones, like Lindholm, has firsthand memories of the aftershock of a massacre. In 2007, he arrived on campus at Virginia Tech, just hours after Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people. He helped coordinate the school's efforts to provide counseling to students in the aftermath, and in 2011, he and eight other researchers published a widely cited study of post-traumatic stress on campus. Using an online survey, the authors found that 15 percent of students developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress -- a smaller percentage than they expected. “We like to say it was due to the resilience of the Hokie Nation,” Jones said, referring to the school football team's famously tight-knit fans. How well the children in Newtown do in the coming months and years will likewise depend partly on the closeness of the community, Jones said. ""After a fire, the Red Cross is there and the friends are there, but four or five days after that, you're on your own,"" he said Dr. Steven Berkowitz, the director of the Penn Center for Youth and Family Trauma Response and Recovery at the University of Pennsylvania, also stressed the importance of the community response. ""Unfortunately, one of the things that we saw in Columbine is a situation where experts flew in from all over country, offering their services and leaving,"" Berkowitz said. ""What really needs to happen is that people who are local need to be trained up to provide the kinds of interventions children need, because we need people to be able to sustain these efforts over time."" Like several other experts, Berkowitz noted that the kids in Columbine who were either injured or were close to those who died had the highest risk of psychological scars, followed by those who came from families that were not ""functional."" Dr. Frank Ochberg, a former FBI psychiatrist who guided counseling teams in the aftermath of Columbine, echoed this observation. ""My sense is that the good ones do well,"" he said. “The kids who have certain problems to begin with, it's those problems that affect them.”Dr. Lloyd Sederer, the medical director of the New York State Office of Mental Health (and HuffPost's Mental Health editor), pointed out that the children in the Newtown shooting are particularly young. “Distress is rendered differently by different age groups,” Sederer said. “The less verbal a person can be, the more they're apt to express their troubles behaviorally or physically. So a 4-year-old isn't going to be able to articulate very well what's happened, or even a 6-year-old. But they may show sleep problems, they may be anxious and avoidant, they may have tummy aches or headaches or non-specific pains. The distress is expressed through the body, many times.”Jones, the Virginia Tech professor, said the university did a good job of reaching out to traumatized students in the aftermath of that shooting -- a task made easier, perhaps, by the fact that Virgina Tech, like most colleges, already had a mental-health infrastructure. In the days after the mayhem, Jones said, he and other counselors encouraged students to think of their psychological symptoms as normal. “It's normal to feel frightened, it's normal to have nightmares, it's normal to not want to go outside and that sort of thing,” he said. “But what we shared with them was that, over time, things typically get better.”   Joy Resmovits contributed reporting."

Nevertheless, we all want our guests to feel welcome, and there's lots of high tech help for making your holiday hotel run smoothly. Make some little upgrades to your guest quarters. Even if your visitors are staying on the office sofa bed, a few thoughtful details will make them feel as though they're on vacation. Avoid having to loan your entire bathroom cabinet by setting your friends up with mini toiletries from minimuis.biz, where you can get adorable travel-sized necessities. For a bit of added luxury, try Brookstone's towel warmer, a plug-in device (sneak it off to your own bathroom post-holiday) that heats two towels at once. Add style and function to your guest room with Soundfreaq's Sound Rise alarm clock, which can charge iPhones and Androids and stream wireless music.  Bring the entertainment to them. The most stressful part of hosting isn't the extra laundry and clean-up, it's keeping guests constantly entertained. During downtime (aka your break), offer guests the best TV experience ever with Roku's Streaming Stick, which plugs directly into your HDTV and gives you instant access to tons of entertainment--it's a totally simple and easy way to experience streaming TV. For light reading, you could put out your three-month old décor mags, but a much classier option would be to let guests borrow your Kindle Fire loaded with the NextIssue app, which unlocks unlimited access to 75 magazines. When you want to get your lodgers out of the house, give them a great smartphone city guide and point them in the way of Know What or GuidePal, two apps updated by locals.Keep kids content. Have you ever experienced the calm that technology can bring to children? Take it from me, it can be a marvelous thing. Getting them engrossed in an e-book or game can provide hours of entertainment, so consider loading up your tablet with a bunch of apps and books. One particularly amazing iPad book, Morris Lessmore is beautifully-designed and delightfully interactive. Looking for a fun but educational game? Little Digits teaches all about numbers and counting. If you're planning a grown-ups-night-out and need a real sitter, you can turn to Sittercity, a directory that'll help you find a vetted local babysitter.As for the rave reviews for your hospitality, I'm sure your guests would give you five stars on Yelp.Have something to say?

They sang. They laughed. They danced. They waved to their parents in the audience. And we waved back. They were so innocent. And so were we.After my son's performance, I ducked out into the hallway with my toddler. He was thirsty. I found a cup and headed to the water fountain. He wanted to fill it, so I let him try. He held the cup at just the wrong angle -- not a single drop made it in. I tried to show him what he was doing wrong, but he wouldn't listen. He pushed the button on the fountain over and over again. The water continued to flow. And the cup -- again -- failed to contain it. As I was about to wrestle my toddler away from the water, my phone buzzed. I glanced at it.

I don't believe that any of us will ever forget the moment we learned about what took place at Sandy Hook Elementary. After I read the news, I tried to compose myself and took my toddler's hand. We walked back into my 5-year-old son's school auditorium. I was overwhelmed -- lucky to be with my beautiful children in our school, safe. Those children. Those teachers. Those parents.

A few years before that, it was a similar phone call from her: the father and stepmother of yet another dear, dear friend were killed.

Earlier that week, two people were fatally shot when a gunman opened fire in a crowded shopping mall in suburban Portland, Ore. The victims left us with their stories only partially written and their destinies unfulfilled. Our hearts ache for these 28 innocent people and for every other innocent victim of confused and misguided violence that will suffer or die today, or any day -- in the U.S. or in other parts of the world. All of these beautiful souls deserved to tell their stories, fulfill their destinies, and share their gifts with others.Although an entire nation is in mourning and millions of people around the world are now grieving with us, this tragedy will eventually disappear from the headlines, and it may fade from our collective psyche. The families of these victims and the community of Newtown, however, will have a long and arduous healing process that will span many long, painful months and years. It will be our responsibility to ensure that finding solutions to gun violence remains part of the national conversation during the months and years ahead. These two horrific tragedies join a growing list of gun-related atrocities that have taken place during the past few years in Auora, Colo., Oak Creek, Wis., and Tucson Ariz. In addition to these high-profile incidents, cities across the country -- from New Orleans to Baltimore, and Chicago to Philadelphia -- are suffering from gun-violence epidemics. Of the 12,664 murders reported by the FBI in 2011, 8,583 of them were due to firearms. These staggering statistics should compel us to demand urgent legislative action that addresses the root causes of these tragedies. It is clear that more effective enforcement of existing gun laws and new gun control measures are needed. However, we must also be aware of the deeper, more disturbing suffering produced by the following: passive indifference to unjust violence, the decline in civic and community engagement, toxic popular culture and entertainment, social isolation, uninformed consumerism, uncritical militarism, and fear-based divisiveness. If we wish to truly decrease senseless, unjust violence, we can begin by learning more about the suffering that people endure everyday through individual acts of violence and structural violence, and by investigating how our life choices may increase or decrease that suffering. In order to build a more just, harmonious, and peaceful society, we must cultivate bonds of inclusion, understanding, and ultimately -- love. If those bonds are to form, citizens will need healthy spaces for creative expression and institutions committed fostering civic engagement and community empowerment. It is through our bonds with one another that we are able to share our gifts and recognize our inevitable interconnections, common hopes, dreams, and destinies. If we actively seek to build more of these common bonds, then we may begin to think twice about perpetrating unjust violence, or passively accepting it."

The news about the tragedy will spill out. Grief is at large during the moment of impact. How do we provide the truth to our children without scaring them?This type of tragedy is actually more common than we realize. The only difference between everyday loss and today's tragedy in Sandy Hook is that today everyone is watching. When friends, parents or siblings die and we have to share the loss with our children, it is just as tragic as today's shooting. Often, children are so shielded that they are unable to understand what happened when they are told that someone has died. They have not been a part of the journey of life, which always includes loss. Instead of experiencing healthy grieving when they are told the news, they experience confusion as they go from the world of fairy tales and good endings to the world of tragedy. Very often there is no bridge between the two and many children will fall into the gap between the story world and the real world. Isolation comes next as they fall behind trying to catch up with their emotions as the world moves on so fast. Not only are they in pain because they feel the loss, but they also feel angry and anxious, as they cannot understand any of it. We must include our children in our grief. Not only does it help them avoid the confusion of loss, but it also helps them discover their own strengths and their heart's ability to heal itself.So here are some tips on how to bridge this gap between life and loss. Look them in the eyes. When your kids come home, make sure you hug them tight but sit by their side so you can look them in the eyes when you tell them the news. They will need to see your authenticity and your vulnerability. They will need to see your heart breaking and then mending. You serve as a mirror for them so they can see their own reflection and their own healing taking place. Always answer their questions without hiding from grief. Cry in front of them and remember that vulnerability is a strength. Reassure them, as it is important to share with them that this tragedy is not likely to happen to their school. But it is natural for them to be afraid that their school will be next. Make sure you listen to their fears and work with their teachers to make them feel safe again. Have them journal about this experience. Ask them to write down their feelings. Journaling creates clarity, especially in kids. Their minds are looking for communication and expression, so when you sit to have the conversation with them have some pencils and paper handy. Start writing with them -- you need to be the example so that they can copy your expression. Steer away from TV images. As a parent you want to be able to control the way your child will be receiving the news. Make sure you choose a specific segment with no violence that you have watched yourself prior to letting your child watch it. Be prepared. Learn from your child. We must make sure we walk by their side when they are experiencing the aging aftermath of loss. Kids are not necessarily more resilient; they are just better able to leap back into the living world and start over. Learn from them, as they are better at life after loss than we are. "

On Meet The Press earlier this year, New York Times political and cultural commentator David Brooks was asked by host David Gregory if the Colorado shootings may cause ""some kind of national moment"" to occur. Brook's response framed the issue clearly and poignantly. He said: ""The theme of the show so far has been 'do we focus on guns or do we focus on the person.' ... I personally think the focus should be on the person. There are 250 million guns in this country. If someone wants to get their hands on a gun they are going to be able to. But we also have this situation where we have a lot of 20-year-olds who are living in their under-institutionalized world, lonely -- with not a lot of people dealing with them. At the same time a tremendous hunger for fame and you see the rise of these spectacle killings. I would like to see a debate about that.""Brooks noted two vital factors contributing to a more violence-obsessed society: first, an ""under-institutionalized world"" that is leaving too many young people ""lonely"" and, second, ""a tremendous hunger for fame."" After years of working with teenagers and young adults as a pastor, and now as a university professor, these observations strike a truth chord, but also point to another, and third, ""factor.""The breakdown of social structures (foremost of which is the nuclear family) and the build-up of technologies focused on accentuating the individual (i.e., YouTube and iPhone) are creating a dangerous new ""dynamic duo,"" a lethal combination of an under-emphasized social experience and an over-emphasized individual one. We now have fewer social ""places"" for creating and experiencing authentic community, for navigating and dealing with interpersonal conflict and more and more ways to accentuate our individuality in increasingly psycho-isolated ""spaces."" There is something inherently unhealthy, if not inhumane, about an all-too-virtual lifestyle. We are creating less-social and more selfish souls, machines of sorts, people who are increasingly more isolated, lonely and socially inept. And I would add another factor to Brook's list: We not only have come to consume gratuitous violence as ""entertainment,"" we are now creating a thousand ways to play-act at it via first-person shooter video games of virtual wars, gangland murders and car thefts.Our new ""under-institutionalized world"" is indicative of one that has become more connected individually by technologies but much less connected socially because of the breakdown of our foundational social-based institutions. In an interview, President Bill Clinton said he fears that despite the numerous advantages of technologies we may be losing our experience of interpersonal or social ""presence."" One organization, as an example, that we depended upon as a socializing gateway for boys for years is The Boy Scouts of America. Now, it is in a steep decline with only half the enrollment it enjoyed in 1972. And, what has replaced the time formally spent in these types of organizations that focused on nurturing skill and character development within a social setting? That is quite clear -- videos, technologies, virtual friendships, and video games the most popular of which, ironically, are highly-weaponized.Brook's second factor leads us to ask what has brought about such ""a tremendous hunger for fame"" within young souls. Researchers of generational trends universally agree that Millennials carry a strong sense of entitlement from their adolescence. They, after all, were weaned on countless Disney movies and celebrities built upon the notion of ""when you wish upon a star, your dreams will come true."" Match high expectations of entitlement, however, and hard realities of a recession and you get disillusionment in varying forms and intensities.Ironically, young adults' disillusionments come from more than a failing American economy and job market; they also have something to do with their need for authentic ""heroes."" No, I'm not speaking about Batman or Spiderman, but real meaningful and substantive mentors. There is a vital place that elders have played in the lives of churches, communities and families over the years. Unfortunately, we have lost much of that. It must be recaptured. For people of faith there has always been a social/spiritual narrative that includes stories of the heroes of faith, stories about Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, David, Esther, Ruth and more. Our restless souls still need real heroes who lived in a real world, endured, overcame and exhibited real faith in a real God.Not too long ago, I met with a cross section of four key generations in a church I pastored in New England and asked them about their heroes. The room was full of people from 18 to 82. As I asked several questions of them, perhaps none more important than this one: ""Who were the heroes of your generation?"" The oldest couples' answer was definitive: ""Oh, our heroes were FDR and Eisenhower.""The Baby Boomers said: ""That's easy -- John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.""It was the young adults' answer that caught me by surprise. One of them shook her head and spoke up quickly and articulately: ""Our generation doesn't really have any real heroes. All our 'heroes' are celebrities and sports figures and ... and, we really don't expect them to have integrity.""Tragically, today's ""heroes"" don't come from the Old Testament or the New, but from celebrity sites and the lenses of paparazzi. But, celebrities are not worthy heroes. Nowhere close. Mere fame or renown is no validation of a person deserving emulation. Fame does not a hero make; rather, heroism is something born of character and integrity. While mythical characters intrigue the mind, moral heroes compel the soul and shape character. Hollywood puts hundreds of millions into creating virtual characters for the big screen; let's put our best efforts into our next generation and cultivating the kind of character and faith within our own lives that will compel them to do more than buy a ticket to a movie, but rather give their best to a worthy cause. The Bible asks, ""Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord"" and then it answers ""the one who keeps his promises even when it hurts"" (Ps. 15:1b, 4c).The Connecticut crisis and the Aurora tragedy both beg us to keep a watch on our weapons in this country and an even closer watch on our character. Our challenge is more about our sons than our guns."
