0,HEALTHY LIVING,Don't Allow Your Limitations to Define You!,"Amy Oraefo, ContributorManaging Attorney; Managing Director, Lavish Affairs",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-allow-your-limitations-to-define-you_b_6744968.html,"As you progress through the journey of achieving your dreams, you will be able to clearly realize that the most difficult limitations and circumstances actually served as necessary tools that helped you become a better version of yourself.",2015-02-25,Business woman with spyglass looking for new business opportunities.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e93e126000032008055ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What do you believe is holding you back from going to the next level in your life? Could it be the lack of financial stability, the lack of drive or motivation, or is it the lack of education or training in a desired practice area? Or could it be that you just feel stuck, trapped in a web of complacency? The fact is there will always be some type of obstacle, excuse, or distraction that will attempt to block you from achieving your goals; however, the choice to be positive and never give up on the ability to rise above it all can be the tool that will help you transition to the next level. For example, the obstacle may be a physical impairment that you have suffered from since you were a child or it could be a psychological fear of failing that you recently adopted as a risk-adverse adult. Nevertheless, that physical impairment that you have struggled with since childhood could in fact be the element that makes you unique and sets you apart from the masses.   Begin thinking positively! Even better, you can make a conscious decision that today you will abandon any anxiety or fear of failure. Instead, consider adopting the following mindset as a mantra-- great success cannot be achieved without first experiencing failure. Failure is the lack of achieving the intended purpose or target. Never give up, try again and again. With each attempt you may find that you become better at learning particular traits such as patience, the ability to communicate more effectively, or other valuable skills, but most importantly you will develop the desire to always learn. Take the negative connotation away from any limitation in your life and begin to view it as a necessary element in the journey of achieving great success and fulfillment. As a human being that is given another opportunity to live another day, it is your responsibility to make a conscious decision to rise above any issue, obstacle, or individual that threatens to deter you from your goals. If you feel like your back is against the wall, what would you do? You do not have the option to quit-- you must fight for your future. You cannot and must not give up; you have a job to do!  Look beyond yourself. Whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, you were created to live a life that inspires both strangers and confidants alike, in pursuing their purpose in life. Consequently, you can only do this if you get outside of your comfort zone, move out of your own way, and become willing to adopt an attitude and desire to serve others.  In a world where we are constantly encouraged to ""get what's yours"", choose to go against the grain; instead make it your duty to help someone in need. The best antidote of pushing beyond your own issues is to consider another individual's desires and exercise selflessness. Choose to be the student in the course of life that will pass the test of overcoming obstacles with high marks, while assisting others in doing the same. Learn to appreciate the growing pains that may come with the process of evolution and the transition of becoming a more fulfilled human being. Change is constant, so determine that you will not be a victim of your circumstances, and you will not be left behind.  Remember, it takes only one ""Yes!"", one relationship, one encounter, or even one isolated moment to positively change a person's life forever. Wake up each day, regardless of your circumstances, with the mindset that you are one step closer to that one encounter, opportunity, or divine appointment that God created just for you.  Despite the bumps and bruises that you may encounter throughout life, you must adhere to one requirement... you must be willing to take the journey and commit to learning along the way. As you progress through the journey of achieving your dreams, you will be able to clearly realize that the most difficult limitations and circumstances actually served as necessary tools that helped you become a better version of yourself. Ultimately, you want to be able to confidently proclaim that no limitation or obstacle could negatively define you or deter you from your path to achieving greatness!"

Communism is a loaded term, but it really should be understood as a kind of transactional morality, where we act according to Louis Blanc's principle, from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs. When we don't keep track of who is giving what to whom, we are acting in a communistic way. Sharing, in its purest form, is communistic. It occurs when no one claims exclusive ownership. It happens when people share what they believe belongs to everyone, or to their particular community.When my son Zeke and his friends play harmoniously with the communal toys at school, they are sharing in a communistic way. When Zeke and his brother Ozzie take turns playing with our family's communal toys at home, they are also practicing this kind of sharing.In Greenland, an Inuit once explained to the anthropologist Peter Freuchen why he would be willing to share several hundred pounds of meat with a hunter that hadn't been as successful: ""Up in our country we are human! ... And since we are human we help each other. We don't like to hear anybody say thanks for that. What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that by gifts, one makes slaves, and by whips, one makes dogs.""Since the Inuit hunter believed that everyone has the right to eat, it made no sense for him to claim exclusive ownership of the meat. If the meat is not considered private property, the idea of gifting the meat is nonsensical. Once private ownership is dismissed, it's only possible to share it in a communistic way.However, private ownership is not always dismissed.E.E. Evans-Pritchard and Graeber describe how the Nuer in South Sudan share food and other necessities freely with members of their camp, but they never share their cattle with each other. Indeed, they will literally defend their cattle with their lives.I was thinking about the Nuer when Zeke invited his friend, Zev, over for a play-date. At the time, Zeke's prized possession was his guitar. Zev wanted to play with it, and Zeke, quite reasonably, refused. I asked Zeke to share his guitar, even though I had made it clear to both Zeke and Zev that I was not willing to share the camera that I was using to film them. Indeed, I would not even let them touch the camera, fearing that they might damage it. Zeke, probably sensing my inconsistency, clung to his guitar as if his life depended on it. Zev grabbed it too, and they spun around the room. Eventually, Zeke relented. Zeke and Zev took turns playing the guitar, and they both seemed happy. It was beautiful, but I was left feeling like a hypocrite. Why should Zeke share his most special possession when I was not willing to do the same thing?In the United States, we keep much of our property to ourselves, but we do share certain things in communistic ways. We share office supplies with our co-workers, and we share pretty much everything while camping. We share directions freely with strangers; and we post all kinds of information online for everyone's benefit, despite new restrictions from Facebook and other corporate entities.Everyone has the right to enjoy our parks, libraries, and public schools; and, at least for the most part, our air, oceans, lakes, and rivers belong to all of us. There have been attempts to privatize our parks and water, and funding for our schools and libraries are often threatened; yet they still remain part of the public domain. We share their pleasures as well as the responsibilities of maintaining them. Of course, some of us share a lot more than others. There may not be as many socialist communes in the United States as there were in other periods, like the 19th century; but they certainly still exist, and people continue to live in them.I understand the appeal of the socialist commune, and I've fantasized about living in one at different times of my life. When I was 18, I spent the summer on a kibbutz in Israel. I didn't want to leave. I was drawn to the beauty of living a life where we shared everything in communistic ways, but I must have been even more enticed by the American Dream. After a summer of picking carrots and working in a salami factory, I moved back to the States to pursue my personal ambitions.The ideal of communistic sharing continues to inspire me, and it seems to entice many others as well. People are excited by new online sites like rideshare.com, couchsurfing.com, and mealshare.org; and many are sharing in ways that they wouldn't have imagined previously. I don't know if I would have been happier if I had stayed on the kibbutz, but I almost certainly would understand more about sharing if I did. One of my brothers has been living on a kibbutz for many years, and we are planning to visit him soon. I'm eager to find out what we will learn about sharing in the process.Joel Tauber is an artist and filmmaker who teaches experimental film and orchestrates the video art program at Wake Forest University. His current undertaking - ""The Sharing Project"" - will be presented as both a sculptural video installation (Adamski Gallery For Contemporary Art, Berlin, April 2 - 29; The University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach, June 12 - July 12) and a feature film. http://thesharingproject.net."

Do you ever feel so involved in watching a game, that you feel like you are in the game? Sports create a relationship between the fan and the players. This relationship resembles that of a family. Sports fans, like other people, separate themselves out into similar groups with common values, religions, aesthetics, ethnicities and so forth. This kind of connection has primal overtones, in that primitive man survived in tribes through co-dependent relationships (1). And, when people in general connect by groups through their similarities, they are protecting themselves against annihilation. Thus, the team becomes a tribe, and the fan becomes invested in its identity. This feeling of belonging becomes so powerful that it can create biases, as well as prejudices. And, fans are so emotionally invested in their tribe, or sports team, that they may defend that relationship against verbal or physical attack. Feelings of belonging to a particular team are so powerful that they impact feelings of well-being, alienation, loneliness, energy levels and depression. We are, after all, social animals, and our feelings of purpose and belonging are affected by our group's identity, including our chosen sports team. Moreover, sports give the fan a place to focus and sublimate his feelings of stress and frustration from his daily life and the world at large. When the fan is focused on a sports play, he might actually imagine that he's involved in the activity on the field. In fact, a fan's hormonal responses during the game may actually imitate that of the sports players. His body's biology then moves him into the flight or fight syndrome, his adrenalin starts pumping, and his excitement and energy can reach pitches equivalent to fighting that lion or running away. In the final analysis, there are great intrinsic rewards for being the sports fan. Not only do we have an acceptable place to focus and deliver high levels of emotional stress and response, but also receive feelings of well-being, trust and satisfaction in our social life.

The March 1 performance at 2:00 will feature her protégé, Ye-Eun Choi, a recipient of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation scholarship and winner of the 2013 European Culture Award for New Artists. The program begins with The Light That Fills the World by J.L. Adams -- this year's Grammy winner in the category of Best Contemporary Classical Composition. Following the intermission is Schumann's Symphony No. 1, Spring. Ms Mutter begins a European tour a few days after her last performance. ""I can't be here for the March 1 concert,"" she said, ""but I'm terribly excited that Ye-Eun Choi will be playing. There must have been a long line of violinists they would have liked, but they were gracious enough to accept her. She is a unique Korean woman who enrolled in my program when she was sixteen. She came as a child to study in Munich. I was very taken by her determination and also her very pure viewpoint on life as a musician -- something which I have found very rarely. She plays in a very personal style and has these wonderful colors. I am very happy to have found someone who is willing to develop a unique personality and not go in a direction where success could probably have come much easier."" Anne-Sophie Mutter and Ye-Eun Choi. Courtesy of SF SymphonyMs Mutter was in Munich during our recent conversation. We talked about the element of celebrity that surrounds the Brahms's violin concerto. It ranks perhaps second only to the beauty and challenging virtuosity of Beethoven's earlier Violin Concerto in D major which premiered in 1806. An astonishing link between the composers and their concertos is super luminary violinist Joseph Joachim (1831-1907). In 1844, while still only twelve years old, the young prodigy revived Beethoven's work and added his own cadenzas -- which are still in play today. Thirty-four years later, Brahms dedicated his concerto to Joachim who played the premiere on New Year's Day in 1879 and, again, with his own cadenzas. Though a number of violinists have since substituted their own variations -- Fritz Kreisler among them -- it is Joachim's cadenzas that have remained the standard in the Brahms concerto and which Ms Mutter will present at Davies Hall. Said Ms Mutter, ""Why not use the cadenza of the violinist for whom the great composer has written the piece?"" The Brahms, like many other important works of the violin repertoire, was a piece I started to study rather early. My collaboration with Karajan began in the late '70s. I was studying it even before meeting him, when I was around twelve. He moved through repertoire quite briskly despite my young age. I was sixteen when I played the Beethoven concerto in concert for the first time. I find it interesting that someone like Joseph Joachim was such a prominent figure in the development of the big violin repertoire, particularly of the romantic repertoire. In addition to Brahms -- Dvořák wrote for him, Bruch wrote for him. He had great influence on their work. This is something which has fascinated me throughout my relationship with the piece, because it shows that Joachim was not only a specialist on his instrument but was a whole musician. It's not a typical solo violin concerto. It is really a symphonic piece of art, where the orchestra is equal to the soloist. And where the soloist very often -- and it's a lifelong task -- has to blend-in when the winds have the melody. Think of the first movement where, after the eruption, the violin has to step back into the orchestra as a harmonic figure but not as the leading voice. This goes on through the first and second movements. Then you have the third movement with this Hungarian finale. It's endlessly fascinating.I likened the pressures of performing the Brahms concerto to that of an actor in a run of Shakespeare's Hamlet, even the abbreviated three-hour version. How does one proceed through the day, through a tour -- with such daunting repertoire? After her long history with the Brahms concerto, of keeping it warehoused in the brain and fresh on the fingertips -- what continues to fuel her public performance of it? In a way, one tries to pretend it's a normal day. You hope that on the day of a concert, your preparation has been as much as it could be and finished to a degree where you can just lean back. But, of course, with the family and everything else, and my foundation -- the ideal situation does not exist. You have to be able to perform under the wildest of circumstances. Your flight has been delayed, you've had no sleep, probably no food other than a banana, there's no time to do anything and you have to rush on stage. Anne-Sophie Mutter. Courtesy of the artistWhat do I bring that's new to it? I have done quite a number of contemporary premieres in the last twenty-five years. I think that collaborating with living composers -- and learning that they are extremely open minded to very different approaches to one and the same piece. That has liberated me from falling into the trap of believing in a genuinely right interpretation. It's always a work in progress. Are the sparks flying then as on the perfect day? Hmmm. My answer is that ideal preparation does not exist. I'm a tennis fan -- think of an athlete like Roger Federer. He has great days and less-great days. In a way, a musician is like an athlete. We have that one chance. At eight o'clock, you bring everything forward -- everything you've been thinking of, dreaming of and training yourself for. The wonderful thing with music is that you always have the chance the next evening to shed light on a different aspect of the very same piece. There are good days and bad days. Sometimes it's a struggle. But struggle is part of the process.During the first two weeks of March, Anne-Sophie Mutter will be on tour with conductor Andris Nelsons and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The repertoire includes the Sibelius Violin Concerto in d minor and Shostakovich's Symphony no. 10 in e minor. On March 10, she will make her first appearance at the newly constructed Philharmonie de Paris. Speaking of dedications, at its gala opening on January 14, violinist Renaud Capuçon played Sur le même accord (On only one chord) by Henri Dutilleux. The piece was composed for Ms Mutter in 2002. She premiered the work with Kurt Masur and the London Philharmonic Orchestra and later recorded it for Deutsche Grammophon in 2003. The track is included in the spectacular 40-CD boxed set, Anne-Sophie Mutter -- The Complete Musician. Only days before the opening of the new symphony hall, the streets of Paris were filled with over three million in the ""Je suis Charlie"" demonstration. I asked Ms Mutter how Sur le même accord might have affected an audience that would still have been in a highly charged atmosphere. What does she think the composer had in mind while composing this piece for her? In concert with Lambert Orkis. Photo, Dario Acosta/Deutsche GrammophonFirst of all, at every concert, I always think -- this could be my last. Therefore, I will give it everything I have. In human history we have learned that in moments of great disaster and desperation, people have always turned to music -- to the power of music -- to the empowering wonder of what music does to our emotions. I get really sad and also slightly aggressive when I see what politicians do to our cultural life. They are not acknowledging that music has a wonderfully positive power and enriching quality -- particularly in moments of desperation, loneliness, disaster. Sur le même accord, as the title says -- is actually a very reduced piece, sassy, and also very short. When I performed it with Kurt Masur, we always played it again as an encore because it gives the listener the chance to really delve under the skin a little better. I really don't know what Dutilleux's thoughts were about me when he was writing the piece, if there were any at all. This is something I cannot answer -- unless I want to sound shamelessly immodest.On the other hand, she has no hesitation in bringing her full voice to the problem of the lack of proper musical education in the schools. I asked her what would be the most important thing she could say to educators, to those on education boards, to whoever is in charge of making these budgetary decisions -- who probably grew up without music education themselves. That led to a number of insights about the recent uproar created by the decision of Bavaria's Minister-President, Horst Seehofer, to nix funding on the construction of a sorely-needed concert hall to replace Munich's thirty-year-old Gasteig, a notorious acoustic nightmare.""Isn't it incredible?"" she said. I'm not originally from Munich, but this is kind-of my second home. It's the richest state in Germany. They want to re-do the existing hall which has a catastrophic acoustic. When Leonard Bernstein opened the hall thirty years ago, here is what he wrote in the guest book: Burn it. Our Minister-President has made a terribly wrong decision and the outrage is huge. Why has he made this decision? Because you would never see him at a concert. He has no idea what he is judging over. What they want to do now -- for 400 million Euros -- is to try to take the hall out, physically out, and leave the skin of the building in tact. Which is impossible to do! But that's the plan. Then they want to implant a smaller hall into it which, hopefully, will finally have a good acoustic. But Munich is a large city -- with two world class orchestras -- the Philharmonic and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra. But we only have one big hall. The other hall, where the Radio Orchestra has tried to perform under Mariss Jansons, has only 1,100 seats. Financially, this is going nowhere. They can never invite, for example, the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra to play there because ticket prices would go through the roof. It's much too small. More people want to come to the concert. It's totally crazy. Why invest 400 million Euros, possibly more, to re-do an already rotten structure instead of building something new? Then you would have an additional hall -- a bad one and a good one. It's better than only one of which nobody is sure of the outcome. I've had it with politicians!So, what would I say? We do know of all the positive effects of musical training -- on social behavior and on the development of the brain of a child. In a world where we live in a multicultural situation, children have to be trained early on to have respect for other cultures. They have to listen to each other -- the dialogue will be something that is more important than anything else in the future. In music, this is a skill that is learned very early on -- the social skills - getting to know different cultures, of listening to and having an emotional bond through music. If you look at the other activities of children -- sports are great and very important. But all these activities are about one against the other. It's competition, it's about beating someone. Music has nothing to do with that. It's about being together with someone and making something together. We are all here, trying our best. It leaves a positive feeling in the air."

I'm not originally from Munich, but this is kind-of my second home. It's the richest state in Germany. They want to re-do the existing hall which has a catastrophic acoustic. When Leonard Bernstein opened the hall thirty years ago, here is what he wrote in the guest book: Burn it. Our Minister-President has made a terribly wrong decision and the outrage is huge. Why has he made this decision? Because you would never see him at a concert. He has no idea what he is judging over. What they want to do now -- for 400 million Euros -- is to try to take the hall out, physically out, and leave the skin of the building in tact. Which is impossible to do! But that's the plan. Then they want to implant a smaller hall into it which, hopefully, will finally have a good acoustic. But Munich is a large city -- with two world class orchestras -- the Philharmonic and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra. But we only have one big hall. The other hall, where the Radio Orchestra has tried to perform under Mariss Jansons, has only 1,100 seats. Financially, this is going nowhere. They can never invite, for example, the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra to play there because ticket prices would go through the roof. It's much too small. More people want to come to the concert. It's totally crazy. Why invest 400 million Euros, possibly more, to re-do an already rotten structure instead of building something new? Then you would have an additional hall -- a bad one and a good one. It's better than only one of which nobody is sure of the outcome. I've had it with politicians!So, what would I say? We do know of all the positive effects of musical training -- on social behavior and on the development of the brain of a child. In a world where we live in a multicultural situation, children have to be trained early on to have respect for other cultures. They have to listen to each other -- the dialogue will be something that is more important than anything else in the future. In music, this is a skill that is learned very early on -- the social skills - getting to know different cultures, of listening to and having an emotional bond through music. If you look at the other activities of children -- sports are great and very important. But all these activities are about one against the other. It's competition, it's about beating someone. Music has nothing to do with that. It's about being together with someone and making something together. We are all here, trying our best. It leaves a positive feeling in the air."

The March 1 performance at 2:00 will feature her protégé, Ye-Eun Choi, a recipient of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation scholarship and winner of the 2013 European Culture Award for New Artists. The program begins with The Light That Fills the World by J.L. Adams -- this year's Grammy winner in the category of Best Contemporary Classical Composition. Following the intermission is Schumann's Symphony No. 1, Spring. Ms Mutter begins a European tour a few days after her last performance. ""I can't be here for the March 1 concert,"" she said, ""but I'm terribly excited that Ye-Eun Choi will be playing. There must have been a long line of violinists they would have liked, but they were gracious enough to accept her. She is a unique Korean woman who enrolled in my program when she was sixteen. She came as a child to study in Munich. I was very taken by her determination and also her very pure viewpoint on life as a musician -- something which I have found very rarely. She plays in a very personal style and has these wonderful colors. I am very happy to have found someone who is willing to develop a unique personality and not go in a direction where success could probably have come much easier."" Anne-Sophie Mutter and Ye-Eun Choi. Courtesy of SF SymphonyMs Mutter was in Munich during our recent conversation. We talked about the element of celebrity that surrounds the Brahms's violin concerto. It ranks perhaps second only to the beauty and challenging virtuosity of Beethoven's earlier Violin Concerto in D major which premiered in 1806. An astonishing link between the composers and their concertos is super luminary violinist Joseph Joachim (1831-1907). In 1844, while still only twelve years old, the young prodigy revived Beethoven's work and added his own cadenzas -- which are still in play today. Thirty-four years later, Brahms dedicated his concerto to Joachim who played the premiere on New Year's Day in 1879 and, again, with his own cadenzas. Though a number of violinists have since substituted their own variations -- Fritz Kreisler among them -- it is Joachim's cadenzas that have remained the standard in the Brahms concerto and which Ms Mutter will present at Davies Hall. Said Ms Mutter, ""Why not use the cadenza of the violinist for whom the great composer has written the piece?"" The Brahms, like many other important works of the violin repertoire, was a piece I started to study rather early. My collaboration with Karajan began in the late '70s. I was studying it even before meeting him, when I was around twelve. He moved through repertoire quite briskly despite my young age. I was sixteen when I played the Beethoven concerto in concert for the first time. I find it interesting that someone like Joseph Joachim was such a prominent figure in the development of the big violin repertoire, particularly of the romantic repertoire. In addition to Brahms -- Dvořák wrote for him, Bruch wrote for him. He had great influence on their work. This is something which has fascinated me throughout my relationship with the piece, because it shows that Joachim was not only a specialist on his instrument but was a whole musician. It's not a typical solo violin concerto. It is really a symphonic piece of art, where the orchestra is equal to the soloist. And where the soloist very often -- and it's a lifelong task -- has to blend-in when the winds have the melody. Think of the first movement where, after the eruption, the violin has to step back into the orchestra as a harmonic figure but not as the leading voice. This goes on through the first and second movements. Then you have the third movement with this Hungarian finale. It's endlessly fascinating.I likened the pressures of performing the Brahms concerto to that of an actor in a run of Shakespeare's Hamlet, even the abbreviated three-hour version. How does one proceed through the day, through a tour -- with such daunting repertoire? After her long history with the Brahms concerto, of keeping it warehoused in the brain and fresh on the fingertips -- what continues to fuel her public performance of it? In a way, one tries to pretend it's a normal day. You hope that on the day of a concert, your preparation has been as much as it could be and finished to a degree where you can just lean back. But, of course, with the family and everything else, and my foundation -- the ideal situation does not exist. You have to be able to perform under the wildest of circumstances. Your flight has been delayed, you've had no sleep, probably no food other than a banana, there's no time to do anything and you have to rush on stage. Anne-Sophie Mutter. Courtesy of the artistWhat do I bring that's new to it? I have done quite a number of contemporary premieres in the last twenty-five years. I think that collaborating with living composers -- and learning that they are extremely open minded to very different approaches to one and the same piece. That has liberated me from falling into the trap of believing in a genuinely right interpretation. It's always a work in progress. Are the sparks flying then as on the perfect day? Hmmm. My answer is that ideal preparation does not exist. I'm a tennis fan -- think of an athlete like Roger Federer. He has great days and less-great days. In a way, a musician is like an athlete. We have that one chance. At eight o'clock, you bring everything forward -- everything you've been thinking of, dreaming of and training yourself for. The wonderful thing with music is that you always have the chance the next evening to shed light on a different aspect of the very same piece. There are good days and bad days. Sometimes it's a struggle. But struggle is part of the process.During the first two weeks of March, Anne-Sophie Mutter will be on tour with conductor Andris Nelsons and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The repertoire includes the Sibelius Violin Concerto in d minor and Shostakovich's Symphony no. 10 in e minor. On March 10, she will make her first appearance at the newly constructed Philharmonie de Paris. Speaking of dedications, at its gala opening on January 14, violinist Renaud Capuçon played Sur le même accord (On only one chord) by Henri Dutilleux. The piece was composed for Ms Mutter in 2002. She premiered the work with Kurt Masur and the London Philharmonic Orchestra and later recorded it for Deutsche Grammophon in 2003. The track is included in the spectacular 40-CD boxed set, Anne-Sophie Mutter -- The Complete Musician. Only days before the opening of the new symphony hall, the streets of Paris were filled with over three million in the ""Je suis Charlie"" demonstration. I asked Ms Mutter how Sur le même accord might have affected an audience that would still have been in a highly charged atmosphere. What does she think the composer had in mind while composing this piece for her? In concert with Lambert Orkis. Photo, Dario Acosta/Deutsche GrammophonFirst of all, at every concert, I always think -- this could be my last. Therefore, I will give it everything I have. In human history we have learned that in moments of great disaster and desperation, people have always turned to music -- to the power of music -- to the empowering wonder of what music does to our emotions. I get really sad and also slightly aggressive when I see what politicians do to our cultural life. They are not acknowledging that music has a wonderfully positive power and enriching quality -- particularly in moments of desperation, loneliness, disaster. Sur le même accord, as the title says -- is actually a very reduced piece, sassy, and also very short. When I performed it with Kurt Masur, we always played it again as an encore because it gives the listener the chance to really delve under the skin a little better. I really don't know what Dutilleux's thoughts were about me when he was writing the piece, if there were any at all. This is something I cannot answer -- unless I want to sound shamelessly immodest.On the other hand, she has no hesitation in bringing her full voice to the problem of the lack of proper musical education in the schools. I asked her what would be the most important thing she could say to educators, to those on education boards, to whoever is in charge of making these budgetary decisions -- who probably grew up without music education themselves. That led to a number of insights about the recent uproar created by the decision of Bavaria's Minister-President, Horst Seehofer, to nix funding on the construction of a sorely-needed concert hall to replace Munich's thirty-year-old Gasteig, a notorious acoustic nightmare.""Isn't it incredible?"" she said.

The question is: Do I bring my daughters, who are 8 and 6, to a kids' movie that looks like a bosom-heaving Harlequin Romance starring a #2 pencil in a blue dress and glass slippers? Based on the trailer, and based on the life-size photo of the new Cinderella plastered on the Disney Store's window, her waist can't possibly be larger than a #2 pencil. There are lots of photos online of the actress who plays Cinderella and she has a perfectly normal, thin, human waist. There's nothing wrong with thin -- there's everything wrong with distorted.Director Kenneth Branagh claims he did not digitally alter the actress's waist. He insists she's wearing a very tight corset. Oh, Kenneth, you say this as if it's somehow redemptive. The actress, Lily James, claims she had to squeeze within an inch of her life to get into the corset. It's true that corsets were once a thing, and actresses still wear them on stage and in films to denote a specific time period, but why so tight for Cinderella? Why such an extreme? More so, why, in today's age of eating disorders and crippling low self-esteem among girls, do you want to present this kind of Cinderella?  Unless, of course, girls are not the target audience...It's a Disney film. It's Cinderella. But is it for kids? Based on the melodramatic/romantic/humorless trailer, and based on the fact that the trailer ran non-stop during ""The Bachelor,"" little girls munching popcorn and swinging their short legs from movie seats is not the first image that comes to mind. Instead, I see a theater filled with:1. Pervy middle-aged men and...2. Grown women in the mood for a good heart-thudding romance. In the latest trailer for the film, the swoony prince slips his big, strong hand around Cinderella's waist and draws her close. The moment is tightly framed, filmed in close-up. His eyes burn with purpose, his passion palpable. The heat of his flagrant resolve sets my middle-aged heart on fire. My husband gets the same look in his eyes when the Thanksgiving turkey is set before him in all of its basted glory.Ladies, when was the last time a man drew you in by your waist and looked at you like that? When the trailer ended, my first coherent thought was: When does this delicious film open and are there advanced ticket sales? Well-played, Mr. Branagh.Bottom line: Better get there early, kids! There might not be any seats for you opening day.An ""Intoxicating Romance""... for children? Here's how one film critic describes the scene when the Prince and Cinderella first meet: ""[the Prince] conceals his royal identity as they circle one another on horseback. This puts them on equal footing as the seeds of intoxicating romance are sewn."" Intoxicating romance? I'm not sure my 2nd grader and kindergartner are ready for an intoxicating romance on the big screen. Who knows, maybe it will be a super fun movie for kids! And maybe I shouldn't judge a film by a disfigured waist or its sweeping romantic trailer. Besides...""You can't shelter kids forever."" Technically, kids aren't kids forever. So, we only have to ""shelter"" them while they're kids. (Who started that stupid saying?) Kids get to be kids for all of five minutes these days. Can't we just give them those five minutes? My daughters have seen the animated Cinderella plenty of times, the last thing they focus on is the prince. They like the evil stepmother parts, the Fairy Godmother parts and the cute mice, especially Gus Gus. Yes, there's a prince. But Cinderella is not viewed through his heartsick gaze. It's not his story -- and the moments between the prince and Cinderella are not presented in intimate, heart-stopping, cinematic detail.   For kids, the story of Cinderella is not about the magic of falling in love. It's about the magic of things going right. Cinderella deserves to get the hell out of that torture chamber of family misery. And she deserves a new dress! Especially after her animal friends worked so hard sewing the first one. When she does finally get out, it's not a happy ending; it's a happy beginning. I tell my daughters that after the wedding the prince encourages Cinderella to enroll in college to become a veterinarian where she can continue working with animals -- her true passion. All this psychobabble about Cinderella being a fairy tale that teaches little girls to wait for a prince is just that -- psychobabble. It's not solely a love story unless you go out of your way to paint it as one. It's a story of hope and resilience: no matter how awful your life is, don't let it change who you are at heart.If Branagh's Cinderella is indeed an ""intoxicating romance,"" maybe I'll make it a moms'-night-out. We'll order some apps, nurse some appletinis and catch the 9:30 showing. My kids can stay home and watch Lady and the Tramp -- two dogs touch noses over some saucy spaghetti in the moonlight. Lord knows the ""intoxicating romances"" will begin soon enough in my daughters' lives. They don't need sweeping cinematic visuals to get them started."

For you, gentle readers, I was tortured for two hours of my precious time and went to see Fifty Shades of Grey, the film. All I can say is I was more disappointed than anticipated... and we all know I had very low expectations. When stripped of the laughable prose of the book, the messed up relationship between Ana and Christian really comes to the fore of Fifty Shades, the film, and it's not pretty. All I saw in Christian Grey was a mentally ill, singular character, who enjoys torturing women and who preys upon a naive, impressionable girl. This is another representation of male dominance over women that perpetuates sexist ideas that sex is something that men do to women, never exploring the woman's pleasure or fantasies. Why not just say what the movie is really about, a sadistic sociopath who hates women and leave BDSM out of it? Christian claims he's ""like this"" because he's ""fifty shades of fucked up."" Well, that goes double for this film.Once again, Fifty Shades is NOT about BDSM because it lacks the consensual context in which BDSM is predicated. Ana clearly doesn't want to sign the contract wherein she agrees to be Christian's submissive, yet he coerces her again and again. ""What do I get out of this?"" she asks. Christian answers, ""Me."" You could actually hear my eyes rolling at that one. Oh, and she also gets new clothes, a new laptop, and a new car. Again, no pressure, but could you please sign the beating paper now?  Jamie Dornan plays a convincing serial killer on the television show The Fall and I guess that's why he was cast as Grey. He does do creepy stalker very well. Poor Dakota Johnson tries her best, but will most likely have to have bottom lip replacement surgery after playing Ana. Sam Taylor-Johnson does a good job of polishing a turd into a shinier turd. On a positive note, I liked the soundtrack. Fifty Shades, the film, grossed over $85 million in its first weekend. That is proof positive that people are looking for some kinky fun in their lives and kink is out of the shadows and into mainstream conversation. Let's keep that conversation going in a more healthy, intelligent, and truly kinky way. Mistress Trinity https://twitter.com/KINKTVSHOW http://www.mistresstrinityla.com mistresstrinityla@gmail.com"

Even Justice Thomas -- as evidenced by his recent ""[this] may well be seen as a signal of the court's intended resolution"" dissent in the 7-2 SCOTUS decision to allow gay marriage to precede in Alabama -- appears to be jumping on the bandwagon of inevitability. While the recognition is welcome, there is no need to congratulate John Roberts and Co. after the Supreme Court issues its decision in late June because they are not leading the charge. Rather, they are facilitating a transition in society that is already happening but not yet complete. Progress isn't the same as the end zone -- and even gays know you don't call for a pass on the one-yard line at second down.The opposition (Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, '80s sitcom has-been Kirk Cameron) has effectively conceded the marriage issue and is in the process of metamorphosing from a one-trick pony to a surreptitious warhorse. By perpetuating regional concerns, encouraging rogue elements and rebranding hate as a threat to religious liberty, these agents of intolerance are proving to be resilient. Exhibit A -- and a classic example of the ""stupidity is often mistaken as bravery"" adage -- is Alabama's Chief Justice Roy Moore, the man who encouraged judges to refrain from issuing marriage licenses to LGBT couples. In putting his own beliefs above the very law he is sworn to uphold, Justice Moore willingly defied the Constitution's Supremacy Clause and has become the poster child for ineptitude. Regrettably, Judge Moore is no outlier with his recalcitrance. Texas state legislator Debbie Riddle has filed a bill that would throw transgender people in jail for using public restrooms. Bakers from Oregon to New Jersey are refusing to sell gay people wedding cakes by either claiming freedom of expression or denying service based on a religious exemption that doesn't exist for private businesses. Mississippi passed a law that codified discrimination against gays based on the concept of religious liberty, and Arkansas, in a move right out of the Jim Crow playbook, just banned local governments from expanding anti-discrimination legislation to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Haters gonna hate, but haters disguised as states rights proponents or strict constructionists are cunning bullies that need to be stopped.While our country has history blemished with exclusion and intolerance, it has an even longer history of eventually getting it right. This is our moment -- the time where we need to double down, recalibrate our priorities and dedicate ourselves to ""The Movement 2.0."" Here's the red-orange-yellow-green-blueprint of how to finish the job started by our brothers and sisters at Stonewall nearly two generations ago.We must not leave our southern brothers and sister behind. It's easy for cynical Northerners to dismiss the South as an anachronistic appendage to the United States based on its historically slow adoption of civil rights. However, the Southern LGBT population is at particular risk in the event of a marriage victory. Southern states have the highest proportion of LGBT couples raising children, but they offer the fewest protections for LGBT families. According to the LGBT Divide, a data portrait conducted by UCLA's The Williams Institute, 34 percent of all LGBT individuals, and 36 percent of all LGBT families, live in the South. And the number of Southern states that have passed legislation protecting LGBT employees from discrimination in the workplace? Zero.We must agree that freedom of religion is not a blank check for hatred. Religion has long been the third rail of American politics, and perhaps it's time to stop proselytizing and start legislating. The religious exemptions inserted into the Affordable Care Act regarding birth control were not only too accommodating to the religious lobby, but also have opened up a Pandora's Box of discrimination. I'm certain that if the government were to explore the tax-exemption status of religious institutions, those that use the power of the pulpit to promote a political agenda would find a renewed sense of contrition. Our nation has long endured separation of church and state bipolar disorder, and the LGBT population is the latest casualty of institutions that preach sufferance and act insufferably. But when a young artist like Hozier creates the song and viral video for ""Take Me To Church,"" as a metaphor for organized religion's hypocritical relationship with sexuality, there's hope that the pattern is changing. Can I hear an Amen?We must continue the fight at the national level. While President Obama signed an Executive Order that prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, there remains no federal law protecting LGBT people against worker discrimination -- and that needs to change. It is deplorable that in 2015 gay people can still get fired in 29 states for their sexual orientation and in 32 states for their gender identity. Yes, the FDA recently recommended a relaxation of its own antiquated blood donation ban for men who have sex with men (MSM), but the new policy will require that these men -- wait for it -- not have homosexual relations for a full year. Seriously. That's Travolta-at-the-Oscars crazy. Even as marriage equality approaches the finish line, raising a family depends too much on the state line. States that prohibit second parent adoption, like Michigan and Ohio, legally relegate one parent to the sidelines, and surrogacy as a means of growing one's family remains illegal even in states as progressive as New York. As long as civil rights continue to vary state by state, the fight must continue at the federal level. We must watch more TV. We've certainly come a long way from Will and Grace. Nashville, with closeted cowboy country singer Will Lexington, is reaching into the depths of Dixieland and putting a (handsome) human face on the struggle to come to terms with one's sexuality. Lee Daniels' Empire is blowing the roof off of the all-still-recalcitrant homophobia in the black community, taking an issue that is too often relegated to the DL and placing it under a glaring spotlight. The Fosters features a biracial lesbian couple and even Pretty Little Liars has teenage lesbians. And with apologies to Mitch and Cam, as networks recognize that the power of these stories supersedes opposition from any fringe hate group, they will continue to commission vehicles with gay characters that realistically represent the community. Even commercials are getting in on the gay action. From last year's Honey Maid Graham Cracker ad showcasing doting gay dads to Hallmark's recent Valentine's campaign featuring a lesbian couple, big business is recognizing the formidable power of the pink purse. According to Witeck Communications, the adult LGBT buying capacity reached $830 billion dollars in 2013. That's a lot of graham crackers. We must make more bathrooms Unisex. Today there is perhaps no group more maligned or misunderstood than transgender people. Coming out of the closet was hard enough, but it's difficult to imagine the feeling of being assigned the wrong gender. It is remarkable how science and medicine have advanced so that people can become their true selves without living a lie -- or worse, taking their lives. If only societal acceptance would evolve as briskly. Amazon's Transparent and Netflix's Orange is the New Black (and Laverne Cox in particular) has helped to elucidate the transgender journey and stimulate an important if not long overdue conversation about gender identification. We may not all fit in a box, but we certainly can all share a bathroom.It is time for the American public to recognize that many of the purported obstacles to LGBT equality aren't obstacles at all. Gays are bad for business? The Williams Institute estimates that gay marriage alone has already generated an excess of $2 billion, and hundreds of corporations are signing Amicus Briefs to the Supreme Court arguing that marriage equality is good business. The Latino community is closed to homosexuals? According to the Social Science Research Solution's 2011 study, LGBT Acceptance and Support: The Hispanic Perspective, the storied concern over Hispanic homophobia is highly exaggerated. Republicans will never get on board with the freedom to marry? Support for marriage among Republicans has jumped significantly in each of the past three years. CBS News polls show that Republican support for gay marriage was hovering around 25% in 2012, a number that jumped to 33% in 2013 and currently sits at a robust 43%. The younger generation of the GOP is even more effusive in its support of gays: Pew Research reports 61 % of Republicans 30 or under support marriage equality. Our opponents may be crafty but they are running out of excuses.Whether the old guard is wising up or dying off is no longer relevant. The gay rights movement is being won person by person, family by family, city by city, with Washington, D.C. a reluctant, self-congratulatory last stop. At the end of the day, sharing our stories and living out loud is the best way to help move the needle forward. By admiring the meteoric (and unapologetic) rise of Sam Smith, or simply by hosting play dates for our children's friends in our same-sex households, we are the catalysts creating the sea change. The Roberts Court is merely playing eleventh-hour catch up to public opinion so that it leaves the impression that it was on the right side of history.Nobody is going to hand us freedom, but it is ours for the taking."

Is your kid's peanut butter sandwich really worth that much to you?",2015-02-25,Overhead view of peanut butter on bread with red crayon warning against peanuts which are a dangerous allergen for many children and adults.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e93c326000035008055a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm guilty.Years ago, when my daughter was young, I did it. I took her to the playground and offered her a snack with peanuts in it -- a peanut butter granola bar, say -- and let her wander off. I didn't watch and I didn't pick up after her. And inevitably, I'm sure, she dropped some; maybe on the ground, maybe on a piece of playground equipment. A little peanut time bomb, lying there casually waiting for someone to pick it up.Knowing what I know now, the memory haunts me. Did a little toddler come along and, with his penchant to put everything in his mouth, pick it up and give it a try? Did my carelessness cause an innocent child to suffer? Am I paying now, in some kind of karmic way, for my wrongs?There's a new study out suggesting that early exposure to peanuts could actually help prevent allergies. I have a very mixed reaction to it. On the one hand, I feel vindicated: Years ago, when my daughter was born, even before this was commonly accepted, it made sense to me. When it came time to introduce her to solid foods, peanuts -- and all other allergens -- were on the menu. Other parents looked at us like we were crazy, but we saw countries around the world with low incidence of food allergies and they were all places where ""allergenic"" foods are routinely eaten. So we fed her Pad Thai with peanuts and shrimp and the girl has no food allergies.Then my son came along. I was prepared to do the same with him. I ate peanuts when I was pregnant and breastfeeding and just as soon as he could start solid foods I was ready to share our versatile menu with him. But before we could even start, it happened: just an accident. A little peanut dust from a jar of nuts; it just sprinkled on his skin. Hives all over, immediately. Red eyes. Coughing. And on the way to the emergency room, the fear: what if his airways close up? No. I can't even think about that.A few weeks later, the results of blood tests and too many pricks on my tiny baby's skin were in: my son is allergic to peanuts, tree nuts and even dairy. (This is not a lactose sensitivity, this is an allergy that has already sent us to the emergency room. This is: your kid's dropped Goldfish could kill my son.) The doctor handed me the Epipens, told me what anaphylaxis would look like, and showed me how I would have to jam a needle into his thigh and hold him down while I kept it in him for a count of ten before calling 911.So I have a mixed reaction to this new study. If it can help other parents avoid peanut allergies, fantastic. This is not a fate I would wish on anyone. And yet: we didn't even get a chance to try it. Why did my son develop allergies so early?Still, the questions aren't the scariest part. The reaction of other people is the scariest part. Because right there, in the comments to the article, were ideas like these: ""The problem with Americans and their allergies is that a child can show a SENSITIVITY to something, and suddenly the whole school is in peanut-free lock down."" Children should ""take personal responsibility not to eat or have contact with their particular allergen."" ""It's only one percent of the entire population that has an allergy to peanuts. The problem is when the other 99 percent of the population has restrictions imposed on them.""I get it. I really do. I was that parent too. I didn't understand why my daughter couldn't bring a peanut butter sandwich to school. I gave her that peanut butter granola bar at the park. The parents of kids with allergies could worry about it, just let me do what I want.I'm so, so sorry for that.The fear is palpable when you have a child with food allergies. Sure, you ""get used to it."" You never forget your Epipen, you clean out your pantry, you adjust your family's food choices. But the fear doesn't go away: it's always there, causing every moment with your child to be tinged with a darkness lurking on the edge. Every trip to the playground is a disaster waiting to happen, because of people like those commenters. Because of people like I used to be.I'm not a helicopter parent, but I track my son carefully. He's 18 months now and I want to let him climb and run without mommy on his tail, but I can't let him get too far. I'm always scanning the ground, watching what he picks up, watching the other kids whenever they have food. Parenthood generally is marked by a heightened state of awareness. Parenthood with food allergies is even more extreme: every crumb, every little dropped nut or goldfish is a potential killer to my son. And he is nowhere near old enough to ""take responsibility"" for himself. He's noticed now that mean mommy doesn't let him share snacks with the other kids (unless I can read the ingredient list, he gets nowhere near any unknown food), but he's not old enough yet to really understand why. Until he is, those ""locked down"" peanut-free classrooms are saving his life.So here's what I want you to know: I understand the ""nut-free"" craze might be inconvenient for you. I get that you don't want to worry about it. And the truth is, you don't have to. It really IS my job to keep an eye on my son. But if you could consider not bringing snacks with nuts in them to the park or other activities, it would make my life a little easier. And barring that, if you could at least understand my craziness when I'm scanning the ground for little peanut time bombs, I'd really appreciate it.Yes, it may be that one child with a peanut allergy makes your whole school nut free. Isn't it worth protecting even one child? Is your kid's peanut butter sandwich really worth that much to you?

How can I lighten up when I worry so much about my daughter? How can I lighten up when I'm grieving my love of 20-something years?",2015-02-25,Man with dog admiring sunset on Pacific Coast at Monterey Bay,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e93c33c000032000a9a7c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I came across a video of my daughter recently, grabbing one of what seemed like a hundred balloons, scattered above the ceiling behind her. She untied the end, inhaled deeply, then spoke in a silly, helium-infused voice. She was maybe 10 years old, we were all laughing on the video, her father still with us. I paused the image, and I thought, I want to be as light as those balloons.Except for videos and photos, I will never see my husband again. Maybe when I die, he'll be waiting for me in the white light. He'll be young still. His green eyes twinkling. I will be old. At least I think I will. I've learned that death can't be predicted, even when the doctors are telling you, ""Your husband is critically ill."" Now I am left with our daughter to raise on my own. She will live her life having more years without her father than with him. I am left to raise her to be well-adjusted, happy, successful. Left to ensure that her education is a good one. That she has interests and activities. I am left to make sure she chooses the right friends, the right kind of man one day, the right profession. I am left to make sure that she can function in the world, fulfilled, productive and again, happy. No pressure. I am also left to repair the leaky faucet in the kitchen. I am left to replace the windshield wipers on my car. I am left to call the gardener to deal with the massive tree that fell over in the backyard. And like all single parents, I will do these things in between the grocery shopping and bill paying, and meal planning and meal prepping, and rides, and tutors and doctor appointments and the overall care-taking of everyone and everything in my house which also includes wiping tears (my own, and my daughter's), doing the laundry, picking up the dog poop... speaking of the dog...I am left to take care of her, too. To wonder if her current near death experience will really be the end this time. It's the second go around with her loss of appetite, lethargy and occasional blindness. The dog psychic -- yes, dog psychic -- said to let my dog's body ""do what it needs to"" should she get sick again. My daughter and I joke that Joel isn't sure if he wants the dog in Heaven just yet. He may want her to stay with us, to drive us crazy, for just a little while longer. She's a neurotic dog, after all. I am left, too, with Joel's family -- my in-laws. Two sets, as Joel's parents are divorced, and each is remarried. All of them have birthdays this month. Joel's sister is coming in for the weekend to celebrate. Joel and I used to host almost everything: Birthdays, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Passover, sometimes two nights each for the two sets of in-laws. But what do I do now that my husband isn't here? I feel his absence at every occasion. Still, they're the ones who lost a son. I don't know how anyone can recover from that, whether your child is 5 months, 5 years, or 50. So in light of these things, this responsibility, this new life of mine, how can I lighten up? How can I ""celebrate"" with my in-laws who are both having a second birthday without their beloved son? How can I lighten up when I worry so much about my daughter? How can I lighten up when I'm grieving my love of 20-something years, even while surrounded by the loving support of friends, family, and a wonderful new man?I ran into a neighbor last week, who I haven't seen in a while. When he greeted me, he asked, ""How are you?! I haven't seen your husband or the big dog in a long time, how is everyone?"" The ""big dog"" was Lucy. She was 15, a genius and super model among dogs. She was old, but hanging in there... until my daughter and I went away for a few weeks, to heal. Friends say that Lucy died when we were out of town so we wouldn't have to witness yet another loss, so soon after Joel's. I have no doubt that they are together now. But when I saw this neighbor, who obviously had no idea, I was rendered speechless. How could I begin to utter the words that ""everyone"" had died? He took in my expression. ""Oh, no!"" he said. ""Not the dog?!"" I swallowed the sobs that were screaming from my gut. I didn't want to make a scene. I think I muttered something along the lines of, ""Both of them."" He clasped his mouth with his hand, lost all the color in his face, legitimately shocked. ""I am so sorry,"" he managed to say. I did not think I could keep it together. This was, and continues to be, my biggest fear -- running into people who don't know, who innocently ask about my family... and then, having to explain.But I reminded myself to breathe. And in that breath, something strange happened. This tremendous, unbearable loss, this hand I had been dealt, came to the surface. It was so hard to fathom! The ridiculous sadness of my life was... well, it was almost laughable! So I smiled. I had to. The next day, I found a condolence card from the neighbor and his family. It was attached to a balloon, a little something for my daughter. I took the card and let the balloon float to the ceiling, light as air. And in that moment, I somehow felt lighter, too.

AFP PHOTO / MENAHEM KAHANA (Photo credit should read MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc145bb230000320093e529.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While few American Jewish leaders will speak openly on the subject, many thoughtful Jews are worried that Prime Minister Netanyahu's planned speech in the House of Representatives on March 3rd will actually harm Israel's security interests rather than help them. They fear that the US electorate, which is clearly unwilling to get involved in another major conflict following on the costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, may see Netanyahu's speech as war mongering -- an attempt to push the United States into military conflict with Iran.Until now, the implications of the positions taken by Netanyahu and the arguments he has made have not been closely followed by the American public or carefully scrutinized by the media in this country. However, a speech by Netanyahu before the Congress intended to influence the legislative process, especially now, after the tensions with the Obama Administration and the politicization of his speech both here and in Israel, will attract great attention.The thrust of Netanyahu's position is that anything short of an enforceable agreement by Iran to give up all efforts at achieving nuclear capability is unacceptable. However, it appears that the negotiators from United States and other of the P5+1 countries (Russia, China, United Kingdom, France plus Germany) are seeking an agreement that would permit Iran to retain its nuclear infrastructure but delay its ability to build a nuclear weapon by more than a year with sufficiently rigorous inspection and other protection elements.Thus, explicitly or implicitly, Netanyahu may ask the Congress to reject any agreement reached by the negotiators and acceptable to the Obama Administration. In addition, he may ask the Congress to add more sanctions on Iran. Negotiations with Iran are already running into problems and it is very possible that they may fail. The threat of increased sanctions may be blamed for that failure. Even if the negotiation achieves the objectives set by the Administration, Congress may reject the agreement. Either way, a failed negotiation with Iran will put the Obama Administration in a position to make good on the President's statement ""My policy is prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons."" With sanctions and negotiation not working, the only open path is military action. Whether Netanyahu's intention is to lead America into war or only to increase pressure on Iran, the fear is that those opposed to another military intervention by the United States - and there will be many -- will quickly seize on blaming Netanyahu and Israel for creating the conditions requiring military action. One can be sure that Iran will certainly do so and those opponents of Israel and anti-Semites here will readily take up that argument. In the end, they may prevail in stopping military action or if nothing else, create strong resentment by American citizens against Israel for pressing the United States into an unwanted war. Netanyahu's views have been expressed before and need not be restated before the Congress. There are other venues available that will not suggest that the Prime Minister of Israel is attempting to influence American legislators to take action that can lead to the United States going to war. The risk to Israel's interests is too great to take for the putative benefit of airing Netanyahu's views in an important forum.Robert K. Lifton is former President of the American Jewish Congress and a founder, former President and now Board Member of the Israel Policy Forum.

(Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd6701f0000df00231dd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Michael Sam, famously, is the first openly gay man ever drafted by the NFL, a fact that often can obscure the man behind the statistic. He has been held up as a role model, as an example of what gay can look like, as an icon, and as an example of how far queer folk have yet to go in gaining acceptance in certain areas of society. While many articles have detailed Michael Sam's story and have described and determined his importance to the gay community at large, I was most interested in gaining another perspective: Michael Sam's perspective on Michael Sam. Sam was in St. Louis to give the keynote speech at an event organized to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS in the Black community as part of National Black HIV and AIDS Awareness Day, and he was kind enough to agree to answer a few questions. We sat down in a little corner, and after he'd retrieved his phone, I told him that my interest was in finding out how he sees himself and his place within the gay community and what he thinks his place is within the Black queer community.Maurice Tracy: I read a lot about you, and it is usually, honestly, [a lot] about football and [your place in the] gay community at large, but I wanted to know about how you see yourself, especially as a Black gay man. How do you see your position in Black gay culture and the Black gay community? Michael Sam: [W]hen I first came out, I didn't see myself as a role model or an activist or an advocate or anything; I liked to think of myself as a football player, as a guy who just tried to chase a dream and achieve his goals, and that's how I saw myself at first. Now, by being in the spotlight, I think my role [has] become more [about] trying to help others, whether it is being in the Black community or the Black gay community or LGBT community. [I want] to help others and have people understand that it is OK to be who you are and to tell the truth. Does that answer your question?MT: Yeah. Think of it more as a conversation. Imagine we are in a coffee house having a kiki. [Michael frowns in confusion.] Do you know what ""kiki"" means?MS: Kinky? MT: [Laughs.] ""Kiki,"" not ""kinky""! A kiki is Black gay slang for basically ""shooting the shit,"" just talking [with your friends]. MS: All right. MT: Do you have a lot of Black gay friends, or are most of your Black friends straight because of sports, or white gay friends or, well--MS: So I have a few gay friends. My best African-American/Black gay friend is transgender. I met her at Mizzou; she helped us in a dinner. So, uh, I don't have a lot of gay friends. I have a lot of straight friends, which we joke around sometimes, and people will try to call me ""straight-acting,"" like I'm a ""straight-acting gay,"" and I am like, ""No, I am not 'straight-acting.' This is who I am. I'm gay. [Same for] people who [are] more feminine; that's just who they are."" ... I'd say I have more straight friends than gay friends. MT: It is probably because of sports. I remember when my brothers played sports, your team becomes your family, and you spend most of your time with them. I used to get jealous over that. But when you talk about femininity and masculinity -- and I too hate the phrase ""straight-acting"" -- but how much do you think your ""masculinity"" has shaped what your narrative?MS: Can you rephrase the question?MT: So do you think you would be received as well as you are received if you weren't so ""masculine""?MS: If I was more feminine?MT: Yeah.MS: So I think it would be either way. People would still judge me. [Some] would hate me even more, but it is hard to discuss that, because this is who I am. I think that it doesn't matter if I was masculine or feminine, because the haters are still going to hate because I am gay.MT: I guess. Also your narrative in general -- how [much of it has been in your control]?MS: I think I have handled it right and the best way ... people always want to see you fall, but there hasn't been an incident all year. I haven't done anything; I have handled myself in the right way. People thought I would be a distraction. I didn't make myself a distraction; the media made me a distraction. MT: Expanding on [your relationship with the public and the media], does it ever throw you that you have a Wikipedia page entry now? Like, you will never just be Michael -- Mike -- Sam; you'll never be Mikey. You will always be ""Mike Sam, the first...."" Is that a lot of pressure?MS: It's not a lot of pressure. I can only control what I can control. And when you say that bio thing, a lot of people want to know if all that went to my head. No [because] I love what I'm doing: helping others. But still ... I could do a lot more than I am doing now if I continue on playing. So I am really banking on me playing so I can help people more, even though there may be a lot of [negativity] because they don't accept it, but when they get to know me, because that is how you change people. People are just like, ""Oh, he's gay,"" but get to know me, because then they'll be like, ""He's just another human being."" MT: So do you actually follow the comments or criticisms people have said about you or what you represent? MS: I try not to. I may see that first one. It doesn't hurt my feelings. I am from Texas, and you just treat people with respect. MT: I am thinking about the conversations that surround people like you, Derrick Gordon, and others, conversations that center around the perception that, when Black gay folk come out, they always seem to have or get white partners. MS: Yes, I have gotten criticism from the Black gay community for dating Vito. The thing is, if you know anything about Mizzou, it is [pre]dominantly white. We are a small group of Black people that are there. Now the Black people can hang out together, but athletes, [we are kept] separate. The only Black friends I really had were my teammates and people in the athletic department. There are not a lot of openly gay athletes. and most of them are on the swimming or the softball team. So when I start dating someone [openly] gay within the athletic department, that person [happens] to be white Italian. If you fall in love with that person, I think it is unfair to judge me because I'm dating a white guy. I love this person; why would I stop that and go looking for something I already have? Also [at the time I was] still closeted. What if I try to find someone outside the athletic department and they take picture and tweet it and it gets out and I'm not ready? So I think it is unfair to judge me and you don't know the whole story. MT: OK, I got a bit of that from the Oprah interview, and it kind of makes sense. But OK, my last question, because they are hovering, is inspired by Joseph Beam's brilliant essay ""Brother to Brother."" In it he talks about Black men loving Black men being a revolutionary act. Some have debated whether he means this in a romantic sense or just a communal sense. But do you feel a sense of responsibility or greater obligation to Black gay men? Do you consider yourself your brother's keeper?MS: [For] me it's 2015. It's a whole new generation. I don't see Black or white. I see the person. * * *I must confess that when I began the interview, I expected to encounter a polished celebrity, a man hyperaware of his image, but the man I encountered was someone altogether different. There was a moment after his keynote speech, during the Q-and-A portion event, when a woman told him that she was childless but would be honored to think of him as her son. Another woman simply wanted to wrap her arms around him and give him that ""home embrace,"" the type of embrace I have only known from the arms of Black women. I understand why they would do such a thing. Michael Sam is a man who is incredibly kind and earnest, one who connects his potential profession with the ability to make a difference for others. It is no wonder that a room filled with people would collectively tell him that he should consider himself a part of an extended queer family that loves him. A version of this interview originally appeared on The Vital Voice.For more of my interview with Michael Sam, see ""A Kiki With Michael Sam"" on Blaqueer.wordpress.com."

""But as I think about how best to serve the people of this great state, I know that my heart and my family are here in California, not Washington, D.C.""Villaraigosa's announcement ends weeks of speculation that the former mayor would seek retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer's (D) seat. With the longtime senator's impending retirement, California has an open Senate seat for the first time since 1992. California Attorney General Kamala Harris (D) announced her candidacy last month, while Democratic Reps. Xavier Becerra, Loretta Sanchez and Adam Schiff have expressed interest in running. On the Republican side, California Assemblyman Rocky Chávez has said he's exploring running.Environmentalist Tom Steyer and California Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom have also said they will not run. (Newsom has instead launched a bid for governor in 2018, an office Villaraigosa may also seek.) Villaraigosa served as Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013. In 2008, he was a national co-chair for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, raising his profile on the national stage. In 2012, he was selected as chairman of the Democratic National Convention and fundraised with President Barack Obama in Los Angeles. Harris, who was the first candidate to officially jump in the race, has already secured the backing of several prominent Democrats. Massachusetts Sen.

This month, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) unveiled budgets with deep spending cuts for public universities. Rauner's proposed 2016 budget contains a 31.5 percent, or $387 million, reduction in funding for public universities. Wisconsin's 2015-2017 budget would shrink state funding by 13 percent, or $300 million over two years, the largest reduction in the state's history.The steep cuts are perplexing to some school officials because the improving economy has helped public universities in other states recover some of the funds they lost during the recession. Over the past decade, lawmakers from both parties significantly reduced public university spending across the country.Tuition increases aren't on the table in either state, meaning universities would have to make up the difference through layoffs and cuts to programs on campus. Walker's budget requires a tuition freeze for all public state universities in addition to mandatory spending cuts. According to Illinois Board of Higher Education Executive Director Dr. James L. Applegate, his state's universities aren't expected to raise tuition either. The University of Illinois system instituted a tuition freeze a month before the governor unveiled his budget.It's unlikely administrators will take salary cuts to close the budget gap, so instead, officials predict, lower-level employees on campus will likely be targeted for job cuts.""All institutions of higher ed are very, very people heavy,"" professor Jennifer Delaney of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign told The Huffington Post. ""The bulk of our budgets go to people, so a cut of this magnitude would certainly impact [staff].""""The majority of spending by colleges and universities are on personnel -- faculty and staff,"" David Bergeron, vice president of postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, said in an email. ""The combination of a budget cut and tuition freeze will result in cuts to those.""Small schools in both states would also face serious challenges. Though large universities like the University of Wisconsin-Madison will probably see a greater percentage drop in funding, small universities don't have deep reserves or as many alternate sources of revenue such as grants and sponsorships.Declining enrollments and sustained funding reductions have already left many of both states' schools with no reserves. This year, University of Wisconsin-Superior instituted layoffs and eliminated academic programs. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, some legislators are even considering closing campuses because of anticipated funding shortages.While Rauner proposed larger cuts, Walker's plan proposes altering key parts of the public university funding system. The budget creates a public authority run by the 18-member University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. Under Walker's plan, the legislature would cede control of tuition and tenure to the board and abolish shared governance, the state statute that allows students, faculty and administrators to make decisions over university rules and operations.The governor claims that this system and proposed block grants will give universities more room to make their own financial decisions.""With the increased flexibilities UW has been seeking, UW System will be able to plan for this reduction and manage it over the next two years and four months,"" said Walker press secretary Laurel Patrick. ""The proposed block grant model gives UW financial certainty for long-term planning and stability, and the annual increase to the proposed UW block grant helps to offset costs.""But some policy experts and UW staff believe that Walker's proposal could hurt universities by giving the board appointed by the governor too much power. Currently, 11 of the 18 members of the Board of Regents were appointed by Walker, with several more slated to leave and be replaced before the governor's term expires.""If there is a push to change tenure, like eliminate it, in today's world you'd have to change state law,"" Noel Radomski, director of University of Wisconsin-Madison's Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education told The Huffington Post. ""However, if this public authority goes through, there would be state policies, one would be on tenure, or it might be combined with some policy items, and a majority of this board could make changes.""Particularly in Wisconsin, which has reduced state university funding for years, the long-term costs of continued cuts could have a lasting economic impact.""Withdrawing investments in higher education hurts everyone, including those that don't attend college,"" Bergerson said. ""Further cuts, paired with the proposed tuition freeze, will result in fewer college graduates entering the state's workforce. This will drive up the wage premium paid to college graduates but drive down the wages for everyone else.""Both governors downplayed the severity of the cuts.""Illinois is the fifth most populous state in the country, and number four in support for higher education, which remains true after these savings,"" Rauner press secretary Catherine Kelly told The Huffington Post.""[Democratic] Gov. [Jim] Doyle cut the University of Wisconsin by $250 million in the 2003 budget, but did not give them the tools to manage their budget,"" said Patrick, Walker's press secretary. ""Rather, [Doyle] allowed the UW System to raise in-state tuition by up to $150 million.""Some university advocates believe those statistics are misleading. Radomski said that in 2003, the $3.2 billion deficit that Doyle inherited made cuts necessary.""The economy is on the upswing, we had a surplus, and then [Walker] decided to do a tax cut,"" Radomski said, referring to a bill the governor recently signed. ""I think the difference there is this fiscal economic environment is much better than it was then.""Illinois public university officials plan to lobby the Democrat-controlled state legislature to scale back the governor's proposed cuts. Democrats in both states have already vowed to oppose the plans, and some Republican legislators have said the cuts to universities are too extreme. "

North Korea appeared to rule out any resumption of dialogue with the United States, threatening to react to any US 'war of aggression' with nuclear strikes and cyber warfare. AFP PHOTO / JUNG YEON-JE (Photo credit should read JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d98a023b00000630ec9845.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Although many speculated that we might see a breakthrough in North-South relations on the Korean Peninsula after high ranking officials made an impromptu visit to the Asian Games at Incheon in October of last year, tensions of late have been ratcheted up again, especially after the United States responded with sanctions to the allegations of North Korea's hacking of Sony Pictures. Now, with talk of designating North Korea again as a terrorism sponsor, there is concern that we are entering into another period of heightened tensions. But might it not be a smarter strategy to create a virtuous cycle, rather than a vicious cycle, one that can turn this all too predictable process around? The true lesson of the recent uptick in tensions is not that we should increase pressures on Pyongyang, but rather that we have to move beyond the current approach to engagement with North Korea.For the last twenty years we have engaged North Korea through a variety of limited forums such as the Six Party Talks, reunions for family members separated on either side of the DMZ and limited humanitarian activities by NGOs. The world is changing rapidly in this age of globalization and the tremendous potential of East Asia is being slowed down by our inability to fully integrate North Korea into the international community. The time has come for a creative and broad approach to engaging North Korea that can get us beyond the current stalemate and open up new vistas of a peaceful and integrated Northeast Asia. As China emerges as a truly global power and the United States tries to define the nature of its rebalancing in Asia, this moment is critical for creating a broad dialogue with Pyongyang that includes more actors and offers more potential directions for future development. This article, and those that will follow, provides an overall analysis of the current situation and presents a few concrete proposals for innovative engagement that can change the manner in which current problems are perceived. By changing those perceptions, we can lay the foundations for a more fundamental integration of the region in an institutional sense that reflects the economic realities of this century. The first step is a shift in the manner in which we engage North Korea. The current situation in North Korea should be viewed in a proper historical context. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 90s, North Korea faced serious economic problems. The lives of its ordinary citizens were particularly miserable, because the basic elements of the country's economy turned out to be completely dysfunctional. To some extent, this situation occurred because of the drawbacks of economic policy: however, the collapse of the gigantic Communist economic bloc was the most severe blow to Pyongyang. The Communist bloc system of trade, economic and technological support encouraged each country to concentrate on its domestic social and political concerns and in general, did away with competitive international trade. The pricing system in the Communist bloc was not aligned with international market prices. North Korea enjoyed favorable pricing of energy and raw materials -- many of which were obtained from the Soviet Union at beneficial prices far below the international market price. The situation was similar in all of the Soviet Union's satellite nations. When this system fell apart in the late 1980s, North Korea for the first time faced a tremendous growth of prices for basic products and was subject to the influence of market forces, which it was completely unprepared for. North Korea also relied on the Soviet Union for a constant supply of weaponry and means to maintain its military. When that system fell apart, the entire economic, social and ideological system that supported North Korea so perfectly collapsed. The loss of Soviet support of North Korea's military forced the national elites to consider the urgent need to defend their country by themselves. In that sense the crisis for Pyongyang was similar to Seoul's earlier reaction to a somewhat similar situation: growing US doubts about its military presence in South Korea. This began late in the Nixon administration, including a hint about withdrawal of American forces by Vice President Spiro Agnew during a visit to Seoul. The trend reached a peak under President Jimmy Carter who spoke bluntly about complete withdrawal. Just as then-President Park Chung-hee felt that South Korea should develop nuclear arms to defend itself, Kim Il-sung probably also had the same motivation in mind. The North Korean economy was built on the ideology of self-reliance. North Korea had been lucky enough to possess significant natural resources, including a wide range of minerals such as coal. It also inherited a developed infrastructure and an advanced industrial sector from the days of Japanese colonization. This enabled North Korea to pursue a degree of self-sufficiency that was impossible for South Korea. The combination of natural resources, strong infrastructure and access to inexpensive imports from the Soviet Union is what kept the North Korean economy afloat. Therefore it was a terrible blow to the North Korean economy when the Soviet trading system fell apart, and Pyongyang faced a pricing system set by the international market. Even in the middle of the struggle to overcome this economic shock, North Korea hastily allocated significant resources for the development of nuclear arms. After Kim Il-sung passed away in 1994, things went from bad to worse. The country suffered through four years of consecutive poor harvests because of bad weather and the loss of topsoil due to the implementation of inappropriate agricultural policies. This blow set the economy back, and many North Koreans died of starvation. The nation was demoralized and the suffering of the great majority of citizens was critical. In fact, I wonder if back in 1994 when Kim Il-sung (just before he died) accepted an offer from President Carter for direct interaction with the South, he was thinking that he really could not continue allocating these enormous amounts of resources for arming North Korea. At that point, some form of reconciliation could have mitigated the huge economic problems that the country faced. When his father passed away, Kim Jong-Il inherited a hermit kingdom which faced a perfect storm: the collapse of the Soviet empire and economic decay due to the development of the nuclear program and years of continuous poor harvests. It would have been hard enough to respond to these challenges even under normal circumstances, but Kim Jong-Il also had to devote much of his time to consolidating his persona; power base as a new ruler. Nuclear arms symbolize North Korea's self-reliance and independence, which means there are both domestic and external reasons why Pyongyang will not lightly abandon them. Although this program is expensive and risky, and has led to the country's isolation from the international community, North Koreans suggest that nuclear weapons are their cheapest approach to self-defense under the current economic circumstances. Now a new young third leader has inherited this complex situation. Kim Jong-un has to cope with a military that is pushing for an increased nuclear arsenal. At the same time, he has to do something concrete to improve North Koreans' living standards. All this is happening against the background of the complex political games that he is playing in order to stay in power. The bottom line is that if he cannot find a way to improve relations with South Korea and the Western world, he will not have the resources and the time to ameliorate the situation of his people. The challenges for North Korea remain significant, and we cannot expect this inexperienced leader to have much free time to explore new initiatives.Read the second installment of this series here.The author is chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media Network -- one of South Korea's leading media groups, including the prestigious JoongAng Ilbo daily -- and a former South Korean ambassador to the United States."
17,WORLDPOST,Withholding Child Abuse Emails Further Damages Tarnished Telegraph,"Tom Watson, ContributorDeputy leader of the Labour Party and MP for West Bromwich East",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-abuse-emails-telegraph_b_6736094.html,The Telegraph might be withholding emails related to a ridiculous smear campaign to label Labour politicians as pedophiles: yet another example of the Telegraph pandering to its friends in the Conservative government.,2015-02-24,"A person reads on July 19, 2011, in Paris, the British daily newspaper, The Daily Telegraph of which front page is on the spiralling phone-hacking scandal. Australian-born and US head of the global News Corporation empire, Rupert Murdoch, his son James and former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks faced questions on July 19, from British lawmakers over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal which has shaken the British establishment and placed Prime Minister David Cameron under pressure. A whistleblower in this scandal, former News of the World reporter Sean Hoare, was found dead at his home on July 18, but there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances, police said. AFP PHOTO MIGUEL MEDINA (Photo credit should read MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc145ad230000330093e525.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Already reeling from accusations of pandering to corporate advertisers, Britain's Telegraph newspaper is now under fire for withholding emails that might harm its friends in the Conservative government. The latest scandal threatens to further damage the Telegraph's editorial and political integrity and independence.The Telegraph's extra-friendly relationship with the Conservative party dates back years. Just before the 2010 general election, as the Leveson Inquiry later exposed, the paper's chief executive, Murdoch MacLennan, wrote to David Cameron, the Conservative leader: ""We desperately want there to be a Conservative government and you to be our next Prime Minister.""""We'll do all we can to bring that about and to give you great support in the grueling months ahead,"" MacLennan promised. He added: ""And as we are no fair weather friend, we'll be there with you too when you're in Downing Street.""Last week the Telegraph's executive editor finally admitted to me that the paper holds internal email exchanges from senior officials at the Conservative Campaign Headquarters relating to child abuse. In so doing he contradicted Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps, who told me that after reviewing the situation he hadn't found ""any evidence to substantiate"" my claims that the emails exist. The emails are so potentially damaging to Tory reputations that the political correspondent who was inadvertently copied in on them assumed the Telegraph would be publishing them, even assuring one MP that he was not the subject of the ""silly emails."" The paper is still sitting on the emails and, as far as I know, has not given them to Grant Shapps to read so that he can form a view of whether they amount to an attempt to smear Labour politicians, as at least one Telegraph insider has claimed. That the Telegraph might spike a story that could damage the Conservative government should not be a surprise to those who read the evidence in the Leveson Inquiry. The direct promise of help with newspaper coverage of the Conservatives during the general election campaign was outmatched by an even more remarkable offer made in March 2010 by Aidan Barclay, the chairman of the Telegraph Media Group. Barclay texted the aspiring prime minister, saying he had spoken ""to Tony G'' (Tony Gallagher, then editor of the Telegraph). He said that ""they would arrange a daily call during the campaign"" between Cameron and Gallagher.Later, Barclay explained it away, saying that if Cameron wanted ""to get the attention of the editor [of the Telegraph] and wanted to get his message across in the most efficient manner, he should make a habit of calling on a daily basis and I recommended that that's what they should do."" However, there was no suggestion at the time that such a call would be restricted to commenting on possible Telegraph editorials.As it happens, Tony Gallagher was sacked by the newspaper. Though he is too discreet to say it, many think he was pushed out because he was too independent-minded, particularly when it came to editorial judgments on the Cameron government. Of course, none of this email correspondence is conclusive when it comes to proving news bias. We have to read the Telegraph's news coverage of the general election campaign to show its determination to present the Conservatives in the best light and Labour in the worst possible light. No doubt the Telegraph will claim it did not hold back from outing Conservative MPs in 2009 over their Commons expenses and then say how tough it was on Maria Miller, who resigned as culture secretary in 2014 over her expenses. But of course she made the mistake of trying to bully the paper, which lost her all public support. There is now a huge gaping hole in Mr. Barclay's claims to the Leveson Inquiry that the Telegraph's news coverage and its business interests ""do not collide"" and that the relationship ""is arm's length and transparent,"" giving no advertiser special favors in their news coverage. There is clearly also a huge hole in the contention that the Telegraph's news coverage is ""fair and balanced,"" and bears no relationship to what looks like a deal struck with the Conservative Party in 2010.When it comes to its conservative leanings, no one denies the Telegraph is a paper with both ""small C, and a capital C"", as Mr. Barclay put it when he came before Leveson. But that is not what the debate is about: It is about the paper's much-vaunted claims to integrity and to impartiality when it comes to news coverage. And now that it is clear from Telegraph insiders and former insiders that the paper's news judgements about its own advertisers are distorted by commercial considerations, is it now possible to ignore the clear bias in its news coverage of politics? Gordon Brown complained to the Telegraph early in 2010 about such bias and ""a lack of balance"" in the paper's news coverage of the Labour government. The then editor-in-chief of the Telegraph Media Group, Will Lewis, responded in a staff email that editors had to be ""cautious"" and remain ""fair and balanced"" in the paper's coverage. But this did not happen and soon Lewis was replaced, anyway. The facts speak for themselves. When the Telegraph had a sensational coup in 2010 that Vince Cable, secretary of state for business, innovation and skills, had declared ""war on Murdoch,"" the paper's leadership shied away from publishing its own scoop. Cable's comments to undercover Telegraph reporters did not emerge until the transcript of their interview was leaked to the BBC's political editor, Robert Peston, who broke the story. How the Telegraph failed to publish its own world exclusive for fear of embarrassing David Cameron merely reinforces its chief executive's promise to be more than ""a fair weather friend"" and to ""be there with you when you're in Downing Street."" And when we look at the MPs' expenses scandal, we find something else: that on the first day of the Telegraph's coverage in May 2009, the first target was Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown with a little-disguised attempt to bring him down. In the MPs' expenses scandal, it was Gordon Brown who was to be accused of falsely claiming money for a cleaner, whilst David Cameron repaid £680 for having a wisteria trimmed on his country home in Oxfordshire. Mr. Brown, on the other hand, was pursued for days but subsequently received an apology that appeared in a small box far from the front page, where the original story splashed. The Telegraph remains defiant over the latest scandals, claiming in an editorial that it will make ""no apology for the way in which it has covered the HSBC group and the allegations of wrongdoing by its Swiss subsidiary, allegations that have been so enthusiastically promoted by the BBC, the Guardian and their ideological soulmates in the Labour Party.""Despite the belligerent denial that news coverage does not favor advertisers like HSBC and Sony, the paper has been exposed by its own current and former employees. No one should really mind much that in their text exchanges on the issues of the day, the Conservative leader and Mr. Barclay are so close that they exchange secrets. However, the hypocrisy of claiming impartiality in its news coverage and the reality of news bias raises big questions about the Telegraph Media Group's integrity. As we approach yet another election in which the Telegraph seeks to promote the Conservatives irrespective of the facts, it cannot now go without challenge. If the executive editor of the Telegraph really wants to retrieve the public standing of a 160-year-old newspaper institution, he can start by publishing the internal Tory emails. At the very least he should send them to Grant Shapps, so that he can form a view of the conduct of those who wrote them."
