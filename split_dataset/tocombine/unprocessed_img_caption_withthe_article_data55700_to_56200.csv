On Wednesday afternoon, a government warplane bombed a leading primary school in Kauda, Sudan, wounding a Kenyan teacher. The Sudan Sukhoi jet dropped two parachute bombs into the compound of the St. Vincent Primary School, damaging classrooms and library.“I don’t feel safe, it’s inhuman,” said a shocked sister Cinta Mutisya, a principal at the school from Kenya. Sponsored by Catholic churches in the US, several international staff from East Africa and Australia work at the school. This is not the first time --in May last year the jets had bombed the same school.  “We just thank God that the children were not in the primary school because these metal pieces would have probably killed them,” Australian Education Coordinator Cathy Solano said. Only teachers were present since it was a correction day for exams.Norway, the U.K. and the U.S. said in a statement they were ""appalled"" by the bombing of the school, and other aerial attacks on civilians in Kauda and the Heiban area of South Kordofan.Over the past month, Sudan has significantly increased aerial attacks on civilians in the rebel-controlled Heiban County, South Kordofan state – where Kauda is located. According to Nuba Reports, Sudan has dropped 68 bombs in Heiban County over the past month. On May 1, one bomb killed six children, aged 4 – 13 and wounded another civilian, sparking a national outcry protesting the incident. During the memorial service of the six children on May 23, another Sudanese jet dropped two bombs in the same area, wounding four more children and killing a 6-month old baby. Civilians, especially children, are routinely targeted in Sudan’s five-year civil war with the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North rebels in the South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, killing thousands and displacing nearly 400,000 people. “Despite all the challenges, despite the hunger, despite the drought, despite the war, despite so many problems of poverty and yet they want to go to school,” Solana added. “They don’t deserve this, what have they done wrong? They have done nothing wrong.”"

The boy was taken to an area hospital with non-life threatening injuries, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. He is listed in serious condition, Fox 19 reported. Zoo Director Thane Maynard said the boy crawled through a barrier and some bushes at about 4 p.m. and fell into the enclosure. The zoo’s dangerous animal response team shot and killed Harambe after debating their tactics.""The reason why tranquilizing was not chosen is in an agitated situation — which the male was — it may take quite a while for the tranquilizer to take effect,"" Maynard said. ""You don’t hit him and he falls over, it would take a few minutes.""The child was in between the gorilla's legs when the zoo's response team took the shot, according to Fox 19. Maynard said the boy was never at risk, though fire officials witnessed the gorilla ""violently dragging and throwing the child,"" the station reported.Harambe had turned 17 on Friday, the Enquirer reports. Gorillas reach maturity at between 10 and 14 years old and live to about 35, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The zoo is closed while officials investigate.UPDATE: Earlier, officials reported that the boy was 3 years old. He is 4."

Two days before Heard filed for divorce, she alleges Depp hit her in the face with a cellphone, pulled her hair and verbally accosted her, according to the court filings media outlets including The Los Angeles Times and People obtained.""During the entirety of our relationship, Johnny Depp has been verbally and physically abusive to me,"" Heard states in a sworn declaration. ""He has a short fuse. He is often paranoid and his temper is exceptionally scary for me.""Heard submitted photographic evidence to support her abuse allegations to the court on Friday morning, as she applied for a restraining order from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" actor. Depp's attorney, Laura Wasser, filed a response accusing Heard of falsifying abuse claims to ""secure a premature financial resolution.""Both Heard and Depp's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court documents detail an altercation between Heard and Depp on Saturday, May 21. Heard claims that she was with friends in the couple's Los Angeles apartment when Depp returned ""inebriated and high.""She said in the evidence submitted that they were discussing the recent death of his mother, when Depp ""began obsessing about something that was untrue"" and violently lashed out at her, demanding that she phone a friend to validate his accusations. ""Johnny ripped the cell phone from my hand and began screaming profanities and insults at iO [the friend],"" she said, according to the court documents. ""I heard iO yell at me to get out of the house. Johnny then grabbed the cellphone, wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cellphone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force.""It is unclear from the court documents where her friends present earlier were during the altercation, but Heard said the incident ended when a neighbor she texted arrived. She alleges that Depp then smashed her belongings before leaving the apartment. Heard also accuses Depp of assaulting her on her 30th birthday party in April 2015, after which the two led separate lives for a month. The LAPD arrived at the apartment on May 21, but the ""party didn't want to provide information or make a crime report,"" NBC News reports, citing a police department spokesperson.There is currently no criminal investigation into Heard's allegations of abuse, the spokesperson added, according to NBC News. Depp is currently performing with his band the Hollywood Vampires in Portugal at the Rock in Rio Lisboa music festival. The date of the next hearing is June 17, at which time Heard's restraining order against him will expire. Need help?

The results are consistently dire: in no locality in the country can people who earn the federal minimum wage afford the typical two-bedroom apartment.The NLIHC determined how much a person working full-time would need to make to comfortably afford fair market rent. They call that the housing wage, or the hourly wage needed so only 30 percent of a person's income goes toward rent. Households spending more are considered “cost-burdened” -- and the extra expense means they cut spending on food, health care and retirement savings.Nationwide, the housing wage for a two-bedroom apartment is $20.30 hourly (or $42,240 annually). That means someone earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 would have to work 112 hours a week to afford the typical rent.“If this worker slept for eight hours per night, he or she would have no remaining time during the week for anything other than working and sleeping,” the report notes.Here’s how much a worker would need to earn to afford rent on a two-bedroom apartment in each state:The “Out of Reach” report determined rent prices in each location using U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates of the fair market rent (including utilities) in each area for rental units. HUD uses two-bedroom units for its standard estimates because they are most common and most reliable to survey, the report states. The housing wage required to afford a two-bedroom rental is over $30 an hour in the most expensive metro areas. Half of the top ten are in California, where a growing housing crisis has contributed to skyrocketing rents. The San Francisco metro area's extreme housing costs seem slightly more reasonable, considering typical renters there make far more than the national average. But in neighboring Oakland, there’s a much wider gap. To afford the fair market rate of $2,100 for a two-bedroom apartment, a person would need to make over $84,000 per year, more than double the actual income of the average Oakland renter. And that still might not be enough -- professionals like teachers and firefighters are being priced out of the city, and officials have considered ways to help fund more housing for families making around $100,000. Renting has increased dramatically in the last decade, with nine million more new renter households today than in 2005. But supply, as well as government spending on affordable housing, hasn’t kept up, resulting in rising rents and extra strain for low-income families. “Between 2003 and 2013, the number of low cost units renting for less than $400 increased by 10 percent, but the number of renter households in need of these units increased by 40 percent,” the report states. The authors say the new data underscores the need to both raise the minimum wage and increase federal funding for affordable housing. Housing is a basic need the government should invest in, HUD Secretary Julián Castro wrote in an introduction to the NLIHC report.“Our nation can’t fulfill any of our major goals -- whether it’s tackling inequality, improving healthcare, keeping neighborhoods safe, or making sure every child gets a good education -- unless we also focus on housing,” Castro said._____"

For the bulk of the conflict, the war at sea revolved mostly around anti-submarine warfare. Germany used its U-boat fleet to sink Allied shipping in the hope that it could starve Great Britain and drive it out of the war. The British in turn deployed the Royal Navy to protect the convoys of merchantman bringing in essential supplies and to hunt down and sing the German U-boats. The most significant large scale fleet action of the war would finally come in the spring of 1916. The Battle of Jutland/Battle of Skagerrak was one of the epic naval battles of all time. A popular aphorism at the time was that the Admiral of the Fleet, John Rushworth Jellicoe, ""was the only man who could lose the war for Great Britain in an afternoon."" The Battle of Jutland would offer an opportunity to do just that. It opened on May 31, 1916 and ended with both Britain and Germany claiming victory.The Commander of the German High Seas Fleet, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, was intent on making a sortie against the British coast in a demonstration of German naval power. He was confident that his plans were unknown to the main British battle fleet based at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, and that he would be able to carry out his sortie and return to Germany before the British Fleet could engage him. His confidence was misplaced. The Royal Navy had broken Germany's naval codes. Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, able to read Scheer's messages, knew exactly what he was planning. Scheer was not looking for a decisive naval action, simply a propaganda victory to showcase German naval strength. The Royal Navy, offered the opportunity to ambush the German Fleet, quickly prepared for their most important fleet action since Trafalgar.On May 30 the Grand Fleet put to sea. The 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Admiral David Beatty, leading the way from the Firth of Forth with six battle cruisers, four fast battleships, fourteen light cruisers and twenty-seven destroyers. The main British force, consisting of twenty-four battleships, three battle cruisers and fifty-one destroyers under Jellicoe's command, came from the Moray Firth and Scapa Flow. On the same day more than one hundred warships of the High Seas Fleet left German ports. The German fleet was split into a main force under Scheer and a scouting force under Admiral Franz Hipper consisting of five battle cruisers, five light cruisers, and 30 torpedo boats. German torpedo boats were roughly the equivalent of a Royal Navy destroyer. The German Fleet also deployed Zeppelins to patrol over the North Sea. Positions of British and German fleets at the Battle of Jutland, May 31, 1916Beatty's orders had been to scout ahead of the main British fleet to a point 230 nautical miles, east of Britain and then turn north to join Jellico's main battle fleet. At 2:20 p.m. the following day, May 31, the British and German cruiser squadrons sighted each other off the Danish coast at Jutland and opened fire. Having made contact with the British Fleet, Hipper, turned his German cruiser squadron south to re-join Scheer's main force. In a running battle, with Beatty charging after Hipper, the British Admiral made a classic military blunder. He split his forces; signaling his faster cruisers to steam ahead and engage Hipper while his slower battleships would follow. Meanwhile, as if anticipating his subordinate's poor decision, Jellicoe had detached three of his fastest cruisers to rush to Beatty's aid.As Hipper and Beatty fought their way south, the British lost the battle cruisers Queen Mary and Indefatigable to superior German gunfire. The loss prompted Beatty to remark to his Flag Captain, Ernie Chatfield, on the bridge of the HMS Lion, ""There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today."" Just after 4:30 p.m. he received an unwelcome message from his scouting destroyers: the main German High Seas Fleet of sixteen battleships, six older pre-Dreadnought battleships, six light cruisers and thirty-one torpedo boats was surging towards him.Under a screen of destroyers, Beatty now turned north in order to link up with the approaching Jellicoe. As he steamed north at full speed, fighting a rear guard action with significant losses, the three fast cruisers detached earlier from Jellicoe were steaming south. They missed Beatty's retreating force through a navigational error. Instead, in foul weather, which helped screen them, they arrived off the right flank of the German main force. In one of those fortuitous events on which great battles sometimes turn, they caught the German fleet by surprise; badly mauling the screening cruisers. German HighSeas Fleet enroute to the Battle of Jutland, May 30, 1916It was now the turn of the Germans to become confused. Scheer received an erroneous report from his right flank that an ""enemy force of numerous battleships"" had been sighted. In response, he turned to meet the threat. This put him perpendicular to the main body of the approaching British fleet. Shortly after 6:00 pm. the main forces of the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet engaged. Though initially obscured by smoke from Beatty's retreating warships, Jellicoe managed, with his greater speed, to ""cross the T"" of the German main fleet twice, sending broadside after broadside at the column of enemy ships. The ""crossing of the T"" was a classic naval maneuver where an attacking force approached perpendicular to an enemy fleet, allowing it to bring all its naval guns to bear on the lead elements of its opponent.Scheer finally ordered the High Seas Fleet to retreat and to steam south to its German ports. Jellicoe attempted to overtake it before it could reach the safety of its own minefields. As night fell, despite a series of bitterly fought individual battles, the bulk of the German ships managed to evade Jellicoe's fleet and reach safety.The British had lost fourteen ships, while eleven German vessels had been sunk. A total of 8,500 sailors had perished. Both sides claimed a victory. Though British naval supremacy had been severely dented, the German High Seas Fleet never again ventured out in force to challenge the Royal Navy during World War I."

Just after 4:30 p.m. he received an unwelcome message from his scouting destroyers: the main German High Seas Fleet of sixteen battleships, six older pre-Dreadnought battleships, six light cruisers and thirty-one torpedo boats was surging towards him.Under a screen of destroyers, Beatty now turned north in order to link up with the approaching Jellicoe. As he steamed north at full speed, fighting a rear guard action with significant losses, the three fast cruisers detached earlier from Jellicoe were steaming south. They missed Beatty's retreating force through a navigational error. Instead, in foul weather, which helped screen them, they arrived off the right flank of the German main force. In one of those fortuitous events on which great battles sometimes turn, they caught the German fleet by surprise; badly mauling the screening cruisers. German HighSeas Fleet enroute to the Battle of Jutland, May 30, 1916It was now the turn of the Germans to become confused. Scheer received an erroneous report from his right flank that an ""enemy force of numerous battleships"" had been sighted. In response, he turned to meet the threat. This put him perpendicular to the main body of the approaching British fleet. Shortly after 6:00 pm. the main forces of the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet engaged. Though initially obscured by smoke from Beatty's retreating warships, Jellicoe managed, with his greater speed, to ""cross the T"" of the German main fleet twice, sending broadside after broadside at the column of enemy ships. The ""crossing of the T"" was a classic naval maneuver where an attacking force approached perpendicular to an enemy fleet, allowing it to bring all its naval guns to bear on the lead elements of its opponent.Scheer finally ordered the High Seas Fleet to retreat and to steam south to its German ports. Jellicoe attempted to overtake it before it could reach the safety of its own minefields. As night fell, despite a series of bitterly fought individual battles, the bulk of the German ships managed to evade Jellicoe's fleet and reach safety.The British had lost fourteen ships, while eleven German vessels had been sunk. A total of 8,500 sailors had perished. Both sides claimed a victory. Though British naval supremacy had been severely dented, the German High Seas Fleet never again ventured out in force to challenge the Royal Navy during World War I."

So if you're afraid of it, that shows you what to question next. There's nothing else to do; you're either believing these childish stories, or you're questioning them--there's no other choice.",2016-05-28,2016-05-23-1464020576-3027020-Kaitie_BK_Portrait_Askew_sm.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-23-1464020576-3027020-Kaitie_BK_Portrait_Askew_sm-thumb.png," A doctor once took a sample of my blood and came back to me with a long face. He said he was bringing bad news; he was very sorry, but I had cancer. Bad news? I couldn't help laughing. When I looked at him, I saw that he was quite taken aback. Not everyone understands this kind of laughter. Later, it turned out that I didn't have cancer, and that was good news too.  The truth is that until we love cancer, we can't love life. It doesn't matter what symbols we use--poverty, loneliness, loss--it's the concepts of good and bad that we attach to them that make us suffer. I was sitting once with a friend who had a huge tumor, and the doctors had given her just a few weeks to live. As I was leaving her bedside, she said, ""I love you,"" and I said, ""No, you don't. You can't love me until you love your tumor. Every concept that you put onto that tumor, you'll eventually put onto me. The first time I don't give you what you want, or threaten what you believe, you'll put that concept onto me."" This might sound harsh, but my friend had asked me to always tell her the truth. The tears in her eyes were tears of gratitude, she said.  No one knows what's good and what's bad. No one knows what death is. Maybe it's not a something; maybe it's not even a nothing. It's the pure unknown, and I love that. We imagine that death is a state of being or a state of nothingness, and we frighten ourselves with our own concepts. I'm a lover of what is: I love sickness and health, coming and going, life and death. I see life and death as equal. Reality is good; so death must be good, whatever it is, if it's anything at all.  Until you experience death as a gift, your work's not done. So if you're afraid of it, that shows you what to question next. There's nothing else to do; you're either believing these childish stories, or you're questioning them--there's no other choice. What's not okay about dying? You close your eyes every night, and you go to sleep. People look forward to it; some people actually prefer that part. And that's as bad as it gets, except for your belief that says there's something else. Before a thought, there's no one, nothing--only peace that doesn't even recognize itself as peace.  What I know about dying is that when there's no escape, when you know that no one is coming to save you, there's no fear. You just don't bother. The worst thing that can happen on your deathbed is a belief. Nothing worse than that has ever happened. So if you are lying on your deathbed and the doctor says it's all over for you and you believe him, all the confusion stops. You no longer have anything to lose. And in that peace, there is only you.  People who know there's no hope are free; decisions are out of their hands. It has always been that way, but some people have to die bodily to find out. No wonder they smile on their deathbeds. Dying is everything they were looking for in life: they've given up the delusion of being in charge. When there's no choice, there's no fear. They begin to realize that nothing was ever born but a dream and nothing ever dies but a dream.  When you're clear about death, you can be totally present with someone who's dying, and no matter what kind of pain she appears to be experiencing, it doesn't affect your happiness. You're free to just love her, to hold her and care for her, because it's your nature to do that. To come to that person in fear is to teach fear: she looks into your eyes and gets the message that she is in deep trouble. But if you come in peace, fearlessly, she looks into your eyes and sees that whatever is happening is good.Photo: Nic Askew"

My favorite character along with millions of other fans was Erica Kane played by Susan Lucci. Erica was a complex and driven woman -- to say the least -- who recreated herself over and over. When All My Children came to an end in 2011, it seemed Susan Lucci took a page from Erica Kane's handbook. The reinvention began. Some critics charged that Lucci's career was over. Those who underestimated her made a big mistake. Shortly after All My Children ended, Lucci quickly picked herself up and found new opportunities. Multi-tasking roles was nothing new to her. Over the years, she starred in TV movies, earned rave reviews on Broadway, hosted award shows and Saturday Night Live, and even sold her own line of hair products. Her ambition set her apart from many other daytime divas. It also doesn't hurt she is beautiful -- with long flowing chestnut brown hair, big doe eyes and a smile that could light up the darkest corner of the Earth. Despite her longevity and appeal, for many years Lucci was also known for losing. She lost in the Best Actress Emmy category 18 times. Her losses became tabloid fodder and running jokes on late-night television. Then in 1999 she finally grabbed the gold statue. Her win made headlines and received one of the longest standing ovations in television history. These days Lucci commutes from New York to Atlanta, where her star continues to shine brightly on the set of Devious Maids. Lucci plays the vulnerable and often times naïve Genevieve Delatour. The show, which revolves around Latino maids in Beverly Hills homes, premieres its fourth season on June 6. Lucci beams while talking about the show she says is not only hilarious, but full of humanity. ""The takeaway is no one is defined by his or her bank account or what he or she does for a living. It has much more to do with who they are as people,"" Lucci says. ""If you watch the show you might recognize someone you know, someone you don't want to know or maybe even yourself.""After being famous for close to 50 years, people feel they truly know Susan Lucci. ""I think people know way more than I ever imagine,"" Lucci says with a girlish giggle.Lucci is honest and speaks candidly about her personal life. Her 46-year marriage to Helmut Huber has stood the test of time. From the beginning she says she was attracted to Huber's sense of humor and self-confidence, and throughout the years she says that attraction has just grown.""If you have a wife who has been married 142 times to other guys and kissing them on TV and your friends saw it and you saw it, it's good to have a lot of self-confidence and a great sense of humor,"" Lucci says making light of all of Erica Kane's romances. ""Anybody who goes through life knows you have your ups and downs, and he has always just been a rock. That's been wonderful for very emotional me.""Lucci and Huber have two children, Andreas and Liza, who is the mother of four children. In 2010 Liza's son, Brendan, 7, was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. Brendan recently had selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery, which involves cutting some of the sensory nerve fibers in the lower spinal cord. The operation was a success. Today Brendan's feet are flat on the floor, and he can stand up straight. Lucci also stands up for Cerebral Palsy, using her celebrity to educate others. She makes it clear that it's a condition and not a disease. ""Those who knew and loved him from the beginning knew that Cerebral Palsy didn't define him,"" Lucci says about her grandson. ""He's very engaging. I always say he has velvet eyes. He's got an enormous spirit."" It's a cocktail of charm, glamour, determination, and undeniable resilience that makes us stay in love with Susan Lucci. She's a survivor -- a legend.""When you say how long I've been married or how long I've been in the business, those numbers are big and takes me a moment to realize that they apply to me,"" says Lucci. ""It goes by very quickly, and it's kind of shocking. I can't say I regret anything."" ""Devious Maids"" premieres on Lifetime June 6 at 9/8c. Lucci will also return to QVC on June 18 with the Pilates Pro Chair. "

Warner is notorious for his work with his organization the Center for the Study of Political Islam and his book Shariah Law for Non-Muslims. Though the former university professor has no credentials in Islamic studies or related issues, he presents anti-Muslim lectures as scholarly conversations and not what they are: bigotry.Warner gained notoriety in his opposition to the construction of the Murfreesboro mosque in Tennessee. Since then, he has likened Muslim women who wear headscarves to Ku Klux Klan members donning white hoods. He has criticized Muslim refugees' resettlement in the United States and argued that only Christian refugees should be provided sanctuary. Warner has warned that Muslims can be ""friendly"" but cannot be a ""friend"" and has emphasized a ""war on Islam"" as a solution to the ""problem of Islam.""In response to his visit, Moore County residents Paula Irene DeCarlo and Yasemin Kan, organized a grassroots protest against Warner's speech on May 15. A resident of Southern Pines and raised as a Catholic, Paula said she believes that youth can teach adults about diversity and peaceful co-existence. Her son employs music and creativity to defeat messages of hate. Yasemin, a native of Turkey and one of a few Muslim residents in Pinehurst, is dedicated to play her role in challenging the negative stereotypes of Muslims. Paula and Yasemin were joined by residents from other cities in their protest of Warner's speech on May 15th. Some of the protesters represented organizations like Movement to End Racism and Islamophobia and Muslim American Public Affairs Council. Protesters held signs that depicted slogans, ""No to Racism, No to Islamophobia"" or ""To Learn the Truth About Islam, Ask a Muslim."" Source: Manzoor CheemaThe Pilot, a Pinehurst-based newspaper, published criticism about Warner's visit. In an op-ed on May 14, Michael Pritchett said the decision to host the anti-Muslim activist is in direct opposition to the group's stated values:""I'm disappointed to see that an organization such as the Moore Republican Women's group is supporting such hate speech despite listing on the front page of their website that one of their core beliefs is 'equal rights, equal justice and equal opportunity for all, regardless of race, creed, sex, age or disability.' How is hosting this controversial speaker holding true to your core Republican values when you are intentionally denigrating an entire group of people for their religious beliefs?""Moore County Democrats organized a non-partisan discussion on Islamophobia and racism one day after Warner's visit to Pinehurst. Open to all, this event allowed Moore County residents to learn about Islamophobia, its connection to anti-Black racism and other forms of oppression, and offered strategies to defeat this oppression. A similar event against Islamophobia was organized at Congregational Church of Pinehurst on May 22. Congregants of the church, members of Moore County NAACP and grassroots activists offered their perspectives on how to fight Islamophobia. Veteran civil rights leader and North Carolina NAACP legal advisor, Al McSurely, offered perspectives from the HKonJ (Historic Thousands on Jones Street) Movement in building a broad-based movement that challenges racism, inequality, sexism, attacks on workers, Islamophobia, nativism, and other injustices. Launched in 2007, HKonJ has been replicated in many states across the country and led to the rise of the Moral Monday Movement in North Carolina in 2012.What started as a depressing episode of Warner's visit to North Carolina turned into a rallying call for a movement against all forms of bigotry and oppression. People from different backgrounds and separated in geography, united to fight anti-Muslim bigotry and intertwine this campaign with other social justice movements.Fanny Lou Hamer's words rang true as the community mobilized against bigotry: ""Nobody's free until everybody's free!"""

14,HEALTHY LIVING,Sleep Revolution in the Summertime,"Sara Scannell, ContributorFeminist, songwriter, foodie and proud California girl",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sleep-revolution-in-the-s_b_10176514.html,Ms. Huffington's book can educate you beautifully on how to do this. I recommend you pick up a copy of Sleep Revolution today and read it as you're going to bed each night (instead of playing on your phone!),2016-05-28,2016-05-28-1464407817-872087-ScreenShot20160527at8.55.02PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-28-1464407817-872087-ScreenShot20160527at8.55.02PM-thumb.png," Image of me showing off my Somni face mask from my Sleep Revolution gift bag. Photo by Milton Dimas. After a stressful school year, all college students want to come home and relax. I know; I am no different. Since being home I've admittedly watched hours of TV, and binged on Buzzfeed or Tasty videos late into the night. Without all the commitments of the school year, it can be easy for us to blow off the importance of getting a good sleep during the summer months. While we don't need it for tests or studying, sleep is still critically important. I read Sleep Revolution by Arianna Huffington on my flight home from college and was excited to apply all of Arianna's master sleep tips. However, as I fell back into my old routines at home, I found it harder and harder to follow through with any of them. One of Sleep Revolution's suggestions is to remove all your electronics from your room around half an hour before bed so that you're not tempted to use them. Without an 8 a.m. class to keep me disciplined, I fell victim to the pattern of falling asleep to Netflix and late night texting. After reading Sleep Revolution, I had also planned to reorganize my room and bed to make sure it was the coziest, most welcoming environment possible. I wanted to utilize all the tools I had been given in the gift bag I won when Arianna visited Belmont University. These included a scented Coco-Mat pillow, a sleep mask, a white noise machine, tea for before bed and a Sleep Shepard hat to lull me to sleep. However, revisiting old friends took up more time than expected and I ended up falling into bed each night far later then I had planned, thinking I didn't have time to decompress or prepare myself for bed. Then I spent at least an hour lying in bed trying to fall asleep to no avail. I convinced myself it was okay to be tired all day as these are supposed to be the sleepy days of summer. However, this does not have to be true. No matter what activity we are doing, sleep can help us do it better. I don't need more sleep now for homework but being well rested can make me far more efficient at my summer job. More importantly, it makes me happier, calmer and an all around more functional person. Summer is definitely a good time to stay up late a few nights and make memories. However, it is also training and prep time for the upcoming school year. We should teach our bodies good habits now when we don't have the stress of all night essays or final exams. I pledge to focus on sleep this summer and you should too. Ms. Huffington's book can educate you beautifully on how to do this. I recommend you pick up a copy of Sleep Revolution today and read it as you're going to bed each night (instead of playing on your phone!)"
15,WORLDPOST,Escape from Falluja,"Diana Eltahawy, ContributorAmnesty International's Researcher on Iraq",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/escape-from-falluja_b_10177600.html,"Harrowing accounts from residents, who in recent days managed to escape from the Iraqi city of Falluja, which is under control of the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS), paint a frightening picture of starving civilians living under shelling and in constant fear.",2016-05-28,"Members of the Saraya al-Salam (Peace Brigades), a group formed by Iraqi Shiite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, march in Iraq's holy city of Najaf as they prepare to reinforce government forces in the fight against the Islamic State group for control of Fallujah, east of the capital, on May 17, 2016. Iraqi security forces and allied fighters have regained significant ground from the jihadists, securing the Ramadi area earlier this year and retaking the town of Heet last month. But parts of Anbar -- including Fallujah -- are still under IS control, as is most of Nineveh province, to its north. / AFP / HAIDAR HAMDANI (Photo credit should read HAIDAR HAMDANI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc0d480240000320021a920.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Harrowing accounts from residents, who in recent days managed to escape from the Iraqi city of Falluja, which is under control of the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS), paint a frightening picture of starving civilians living under shelling and in constant fear.Since the start of the military offensive by Iraqi forces to retake the city of Falluja on 23 May, a chorus of voices including the United Nations and humanitarian and human rights organizations has pleaded for the lives and safety of an estimated 50,000 civilians still trapped in the besieged city. Because IS fighters prohibit the use of phones and the internet and brutally repress any form of dissent and communication with the outside word, it is impossible to precisely assess the scale of civilian suffering in Falluja. But residents who have managed to escape gave distressing accounts to Amnesty International of the possible dangers those fleeing the city face. These include being caught by IS fighters and executed on the spot, treacherous routes out contaminated by mines and other explosive remnants of war, and the risk of arrests and other revenge attacks by the government-backed Popular Mobilization Units (predominantly Shi'a militias). A resident from the outskirts of Falluja who arrived at a camp for internally displaced people in Amariyat al-Falluja on 24 May described to us the desperate situation inside the city, which has been under siege for months:""There is nothing in Falluja: no food, no medical services, no electricity, no gas... We had to bring water from the [river] bank; we took out old dates that have been in storage for five years to feed our children... We were living under lots of shelling...My niece died in shelling six months ago; so did two other relatives...Since I got here, I heard that two other cousins were killed."" A man who arrived at the camp on 23 May recounted his treacherous journey to escape the outskirts of Falluja. He said he and 87 others, including children and the elderly walked, for four hours passing through water ditches and that they came under fire from IS forces. ""My 11 year old brother was shot in the leg; I carried him on my shoulders for the rest of the way... I heard that a woman and her toddler were killed that night en route... We knew the journey would be hard, but we couldn't stay...The situation in the town is desperate... People are starving to death, some are committing suicide,"" he said.A woman who made the same journey a day later together with 19 other families told Amnesty International said IS fighters prevented people from leaving. ""We had to be smuggled out...It was a very difficult journey, we would walk a bit and then sit and rest...We took nothing with us, just our children on our backs... we were warned that there are mines on the road; we heard that a woman stepped on a mine and died.""The Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi and Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most eminent Shi'a cleric, have called on the forces attempting to retake Falluja to protect civilians. However, it remains to be seen how far this is being applied, with reports of heavy shelling of the city. Iraqi forces must take all feasible precautions to protect civilians and refrain from using explosive weapons with wide area effects, including artillery and mortars, in populated civilian areas. Several residents also expressed fears to Amnesty International that IS is seeking to use civilians as human shields, particularly in the centre of the town - a serious violation of international humanitarian law.Other residents of Falluja might be deterred from leaving the city due to fear of reprisals and punishment by militias for their presumed support for IS. In a video widely circulated online ahead of the operation on Falluja, Aos Al-Khafaji, a commander of the Abu Fadl al-Abas militia, part of the PMU, called for the ""purification"" of the city of Falluja, which he described as a source of ""terrorism"". It is crucial that the Iraqi authorities facilitate the safe exit of civilians wishing to leave Falluja and prevent any reprisal attacks. Residents who escaped Falluja told Amnesty International that all men were initially detained, ostensibly for security screening and interrogation. ""Once we saw the army and raised white flags, the men were separated from the women and children... We [men] were taken to the Amiriyat [al-Falluja] Directorate [police station]; we stayed there for three nights and were interrogated by officers in military uniform,"" said one man who escaped. He said they were then driven to an army unit while blindfolded and with their hands tied. At checkpoints they were kicked, insulted and beaten by members of the PMU. They were eventually released after their names were checked on a computer database. The UN estimates that some 800 people have fled the city and its outskirts since 22 May. As further people manage to escape, we are likely to hear more horrific stories in the coming days. We can only hope that they are granted safe passage out of the city, and will have homes and families to return to one day. Those who remain trapped in Falluja should be provided with humanitarian aid immediately to ensure no one in the city starves to death."
16,POLITICS,The Sanders Phenomenon,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; author, 'Arab Voices'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-sanders-phenomenon_b_10180994.html,"Responding to voters deeply felt needs, Sanders has given birth to a true progressive movement that, if understood, embraced, and, most importantly, sustained, can, as he has noted, bring revolutionary change to America. It is a phenomenon.",2016-05-28,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign stop in Rapid City, S.D., on Thursday, May 12, 2016. Sanders spoke to hundreds of people on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and thousands of people in Rapid City Thursday during a campaign swing through South Dakota. (AP Photo/Kristina Barker)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81601240000300098b579.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is a Sanders phenomenon. It is real and the factors that have prompted its emergence need to addressed and understood.  When this year's presidential primary began, many dismissed the Democratic Party contest as a ""done deal"". It was assumed that Secretary Clinton would be the inevitable nominee--with the primaries and caucuses being a bothersome but required pro forma affair that Clinton would have to endure, until she had accumulated enough delegates to be declared the nominee.  One year ago, Clinton was leading the rest of the Democratic field by between 50 to 60 points with none of her opponents believed to be serious challengers--especially the 74 year old socialist Senator from Vermont. Back then, Sanders support came largely from a core group of progressive activists who were driving his campaign. A year later, much has changed with the gap between Clinton and Sanders, among Democrats, having been narrowed to single digits. When the preferences of all voters (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents) are considered and Clinton and Sanders are matched separately against the GOP's nominee, Donald Trump, a very different picture emerges. The average of this month's polls show Trump beating Clinton by slightly less than 1 point. The same polls averages show Sanders beating Trump by about 11 points. And polls in key battleground states show much the same--with Clinton and Trump running neck and neck and Sanders beating Trump in every state.   That's what happened, but the question that needs to be answered is why? Several factors point the way.  Part of Secretary Clinton's problem is that she is running for president in a year when voter distrust of and even anger at the political and economic establishments has come to define the national mood. Many voters do not believe that politicians and corporate leaders consider the public's wellbeing in their decision-making. Given this setting, Clinton's claim of experience and her long-standing ties to Wall Street investors have become liabilities.  In the contest between Clinton, the ultimate ""insider"", and Sanders, the ultimate ""outsider"", Sanders has a decided edge.  Then there are the matters of authenticity and trust. Polls demonstrate that voters, especially the young and the growing number of those who declare no affiliation with either party, are drawn to Sanders because they see him as authentic and they trust him. Among voters under 45, Sanders beats Clinton by a margin of 2 to 1. And when all voters are asked who they trust more, Sanders wins by 3 to 1.  These two factors, distrust of the establishment and the yearning for a leader who is authentic and can be trusted, form the underpinnings of the Sanders' phenomenon. The ""meat on the bones"" are the issues he has championed.  America is, without a doubt, a wealthy nation. The GDP and the performance of the stock market, despite an occasional dip, appear to suggest a healthy economy. But in spite of this, real incomes for the middle class have been stagnant for decades leaving most Americans struggling to make ends meet.  When Sanders points out that the top 1% in the US control more of the nation's wealth than the bottom 90% and when he notes that the American middle class controls a smaller percentage of our nation's wealth than the middle class in any other industrialized country, that message resonates. As does his broader message of economic justice and a reordering of political/economic priorities. While Sanders' calls for ""health care for all"", tuition-free higher education, and his proposal to pay for these programs by imposing stiffer taxes on the wealthiest 1% are dismissed as unworkable and ""socialist"", they have been embraced by young and working class voters who are hungry for change. And when he criticizes the corrupting influence of ""big money"" in our politics, voters respond in agreement.  As this election is entering its final round, it is clear that the Sanders phenomenon must be taken seriously. Despite the view of media pundits and the Democratic establishment that the contest is over (a form of voter suppression) and calls that Sanders should withdraw from the race, he continues to demonstrate electoral strength--winning 2 out of the last 3 and 12 out of the last 20 states.  At this point, Sanders can legitimately claim the support of about one-half of the Democratic Party's base. This cannot be dismissed. Nor can his observation that he outperforms Clinton with Independents and fares better against the GOP in national and battleground state polls.  Democrats would be making a mistake to ignore both the ""meta issues"" of distrust of the establishment and the voters' desire to have a candidate they can trust, as well as Sanders' far-reaching agenda for political and economic reform.  I believe that should he win in California, Sanders can make a strong case urging the party's super-delegates to support his candidacy. It is this group--many of whom had endorsed Clinton before this election had even begun--that have made her margin over Sanders appear to be insurmountable. But even if he does not win, what he represents cannot be dismissed or reduced to any single issue, as many of the press reports on his platform picks attempted to do this past week. What Sanders represents and the far-reaching change in domestic and foreign policy he has advocated and that many voters have endorsed should not be ignored.  Responding to voters deeply felt needs, Sanders has given birth to a true progressive movement that, if understood, embraced, and, most importantly, sustained, can, as he has noted, bring revolutionary change to America. It is a phenomenon.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

He remained in the Justice Minister's job despite a lot of cries for his ouster. His political career faltered later -- but not from the faked-degree revelation. Zvarych weathered the fabrication storm because most Ukrainians viewed it as part of the norm -- the same way that most Russians view the Naryshkin disclosure.Dissernet's outings have succeeded in prodding Russian educational officials into stripping a few Ph.D. holders of their degrees.

19,IMPACT,Happiness Level as an Alternative to Economic Growth,"St. Gallen Symposium, ContributorThe world's premier opportunity for healthy debates between ge...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/happiness-level-as-an-alt_b_10179408.html,,2016-05-28,2016-05-28-1464433848-2870273-HatMatrixLeverageValues.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-28-1464433848-2870273-HatMatrixLeverageValues-thumb.jpg,"By Yang Chuyi, member of the St. Gallen Symposium's global Leaders of Tomorrow communityIn the famous 75-year long Harvard Grant Study, it is revealed that the essence of a fulfilling life is about love instead of money, power or achievement. This stunning result has triggered my further thinking towards the happiness level of a nation. What if the numerous numbers, ratios and indicators of economy that we carefully measure and monitor are not as important as we previously considered?  In microeconomic theory, there will be decreasing marginal utility of consumption as well as wealth for an individual. Nevertheless, I argue that there will not be decreasing marginal utility of happiness or satisfaction level. Therefore, I further propose that the happiness level of a nation is not all about economic growth. Besides economic growth, the average national subjective well-being or the happiness level of each individual is another pertinent issue to be considered by politicians and economic decision makers. Compared with utility, happiness is a more pertinent and subtle measure of satisfaction derived from utility. Therefore, from my perspective, the happiness levels of each individual as well as of a nation are alternatives to economic growth. Though contingent on social economic progress, happiness level or well-being is not a mere function of aggregate economic growth. I. The Economics of Happiness: Study on Average National Subjective Well-being Yearly data of 121 countries were used for the regression model. The dependent variable is Life Ladder, which is a measure of subjective well-being (SWB). The Cantril ladder questions consist of questions on the quality of lives and the choices range from 0 to 10 (World Happiness Report 2015). The SWB is measured based on survey method in the Gallup World Poll (GWP), as of December 26, 2014. The dependent variables are chosen according to economic intuition and with reference to World Happiness Report 2015.Adopting all-possible-regressions selection methodology in econometrics, it is therefore concluded that social support, healthy life expectancy at birth, positive affect, perceptions of corruption and unemployment rate play a role in influencing the happiness level. Regression result:  LifeLadder = -1.62087*Corruption+ 2.136114* Support+ 0.0770475*Health+2.077366*Positive-0.0232312*UnemploymentIt could be inferred that people might react to the benefits and welfare resulting from higher GDP per capita of the country. Hence, money alone might not add to more happiness; rather it is the well-functioning government system, better health care, enhanced social support and decreasing unemployment rate that determine the happiness level.II. Happiness is not only a Concept for Individual but also for a Nation According to Figure 1, determinants of happiness in most countries cluster in the bundle. Nevertheless, there exist several outliers, potential reasons of which include war, extreme poverty and inefficient government. As the famous quote from Anna Karenina written by Leo Tolstoy, ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" Economic growth is an important component of happiness level but definitely not a universal remedy for unhappiness. Though economic policies of each country are different, well-being of her people is an indispensable component to be considered. Therefore, it can be concluded that there exists idiosyncratic components in the happiness level whereas there is always a different reason for departing from happiness, which holds true for the national level.    Figure 1 Hat Matrix Leverage ValuesIII. The Way Out: Happiness as a Macro-Micro Equilibrium My analysis adds to the existing literature a robust way of examining the potential factors that influence average national happiness level, by incorporating both macroeconomic and microeconomic components in the analysis.While designing policies focusing on economic growth, equal attentions are deserved to improve health systems, to build a more efficient government, to prove more social support and to create a more favorable living environment. As my study suggests, happiness shall be a universal concept and individual well-being shall enter into both macro and micro areas as an important concept. Languages spoken by people of the country might also be taken into consideration. According to Keith Chen (2013), language could influence people's economic behavior, including savings rates, health behaviors and retirement assets. It is therefore further hypothesized that languages spoken by people might play a role in determining happiness level. Therefore, instead of focusing on the mere number indicating economic growth, governments shall put more weight on the well-being of individuals. It is therefore suggested that a certain proportion of budget be allocated to improve the health systems and social welfare systems. Meanwhile, a more efficient government without corruption is highly advocated. Increase in happiness level of a nation is to some extent an invisible form of economic growth that cannot be neglected. In conclusion, the channel of individual well-being cannot be ignored in designing macroeconomic policies concerning economic growth. Moreover, happiness level shall replace economic growth as the guideline for development!"

When it comes to online presence, these furry personalities are off the leash. Due in part to the rise of the visual web, pets have overtaken Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter with their fluffy photo stories about four-legged life.  Brands clicking onto visual influencer marketing and partnering with pets are barking up the right tree. By merging social media with the powerhouse of pet memes, and linking these to pet influencers, brands have discovered the online secret sauce for brand awareness, clicks and shares - but it's not the brands making pets famous, it's the other way around.   Forget the pets of famous celebrities - Ariana Grande's mixed-breed rescue Toulouse was featured in a Coach campaign - it's a dog's life for everyday-turned-Instafamous pooches (and pretty sweet for their feline peers too).Here are the 5 most influential dogs on the web:1. My name is Boo. I am a dog. Life is good.Boo, a megastar Pomeranian, has almost 46k followers on Instagram, over 4000 followers on Twitter and a staggering 17.5 million Facebook fans. He became an overnight success in 2010 when singer Ke$ha tweeted a link to her new boyfriend, Boo.  Boo has also featured in several picture books. Boo: The Life of the World's Cutest Dog has been published in ten languages. In 2012, he was named the official Pet Liaison and spokesdog for Virgin America airline in a campaign which featured photos of him in an airplane along with advice for people traveling with pets.2. Jiff, a Pomeranian powerhouse.With 2.4 million Instagram followers, 1.4 million Facebook fans, credits in Katy Perry's Dark Horse music video and Covergirl commercial, as well as his own range of Jiffmojis, Jiff - another famous Pomeranian - is the stuff (or the fluff) of legends. He's even been called too cute to actually exist.  With that kind of fame, it's no surprise that his bio reads like the classic Hollywood maxim: ""have your people call my people."" Jiff is an extremely talented Movie Actor / Model who is available for Television, Commercials, Films as well as live appearances.3. Chloe, proof that big influencers come in mini packages.This fashion-forward mini French bulldog has collaborated with brands like Vogue, Martha Stewart, Barneys, Bow & Drape and Petsmart. Chloe might be petite - she's about half the size of an average French bulldog - but with 130k Instagram followers, 45.9k Facebook fans, and 222k Twitter followers, her influence is clearly massive.  She's been snapped living the dog's life in 5 different countries, has featured in a Budweiser Superbowl promotion, and raises money in support of the Humane Society of New York. Plus, she's really cute. 4. Toast, the toothless toast of the town. Toast was rescued in North Carolina in 2011 and, because her teeth had rotted, had to have all of them removed. Her 354k Instagram followers clearly love her toothless take on the world (with her tongue lolling out in most of her photos, what's not to love?). Having come from a puppy mill, this King Charles spaniel is a big supporter of the adopt-don't-buy principle when it comes to pets.  She also recently published a book, Toast Hampton: How to Summer in Style.5. Tuna: true beauty comes from within.The underdog with the overbite, Tuna was rescued at a farmer's market in Los Angeles in 2010. His exaggerated overbite and wrinkly neck have made him an online megastar, earning him some 1.7 million Instagram followers who champion his endearing physical differences, and help spread the message that true beauty comes from within. He's also an ambassador for animal rescue. Order his inspirational tell-all book here.Although there are many more dogs climbing their way up the social ladder, I think that's all we have time for today. One of my favourite perks of the job over at Webfluential is getting insight into doggy trends and talent, as more and more pet influencers join the platform. It's been fun to share some of that with you today, it's an exciting time to be alive!"

24,BUSINESS,Verizon And Unions Reach 'Tentative Agreement' To End Strike,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/verizon-unions-strike-end_us_57488844e4b03ede4414ba35,The largest strike in five years may soon be over.,2016-05-27,"People demonstrate outside a Verizon wireless store in New York on April 18, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57488bf0160000ab02f94af1.jpeg?cache=eoriyaORUJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Friday that telecom giant Verizon and two unions representing its workers reached a tentative agreement that will end a massive, six-week strike.In a statement, Perez said the parties had resolved their remaining issues ""in principle,"" but were still hammering out the contract language. Once that is done, the unions -- the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- will submit the contract to membership for ratification.""This tentative resolution is a testament to the power of collective bargaining,"" Perez said. ""I commend the leadership of Verizon, CWA, and IBEW for their commitment to resolving these difficult issues in the spirit of constructive engagement.""Verizon technicians and customer service reps for the company’s wireline phone business first walked off the job in mid-April. By modern U.S. standards, the work stoppage is huge — including some 37,000 workers, stretching from the Northeast through the mid-Atlantic. It is the largest U.S. strike in five years and has begun to hurt business for Verizon, which owns AOL, The Huffington Post's parent company.The two sides had already resolved questions over pay and benefits for workers, but were hung up on contract language that would enable Verizon to outsource work. The unions were adamantly opposed to giving the company that ability. It isn't clear yet how that issue plays in the tentative agreement.A spokeswoman for IBEW confirmed that the tentative agreement was reached, but couldn't immediately comment on the contract language.Lonnie R. Stephenson, IBEW's president, called the deal ""mutually beneficial"" in a statement, and said leadership would be providing the details to members in the coming days. CWA said that the contract accomplished ""our major goals"" and that the union would be ending its picket lines.CWA said the deal with Verizon includes a first contract for a group of Verizon Wireless workers represented by the union. The wireless side of the company is overwhelmingly union-free, so the new contract would offer CWA an important toehold in a growing business for Verizon.A Verizon spokesman declined to comment on the tentative agreement, saying only that Perez's announcement ""speaks for itself.""This is a developing story and will be updated."

Here's what she had to say. Congrats on ""Josephine."" What drew you to this particular project? I was drawn to this project because of the remarkable and widely unknown story of Josephine Baker. There is so much emphasis put on her banana dance but not as much placed on her humanitarian work, her heroism in the French Resistance during World War II, her civil rights activism, and her deep love for humanity. This musical captures the true Josephine Baker. I feel honored to share her story.Did you see any parallels between Josephine Baker's life and your own work as a singer-songwriter? In some ways, yes. As a black artist, I was often expected to sing just one style of music. But I have always felt that in order to be my complete self, I needed to break barriers and venture outside of the box – do the unexpected. Becoming a Broadway entertainer has always been one of my goals because I’ve always loved musical theater, but I also love being a recording artist. I’ve recorded albums in many genres, R&B, dance, pop, and jazz. And so, like Josephine Baker, I am an artist with a myriad of passions and goals who must also challenge stereotypes and labels.What will audiences who are fans of your work as a singer-songwriter find most appealing about the show? I’m so excited for audiences to have the opportunity to see how uninhibited I am in this role. I feel a true kinship with Josephine Baker, and I believe that will translate in my portrayal of her on stage. For the first time, I am also able to use all of my talents in one show – dancing, singing and acting – and that’s really thrilling. There is a tremendous amount of dancing, from tap to African, but there is also a lot of beautiful music – soulful, jazzy ballads, upbeat dance numbers, and heart-wrenching love songs. It is really the perfect musical to showcase the full spectrum of my artistry.Aside from Baker's own skills as a singer, what is it about her life that lends itself well to a musical adaptation? Josephine Baker was fearless as a person and as a performer, but she was also a dreamer. She broke down cultural and societal barriers, and that was groundbreaking for an African-American woman, or any woman at that time in our history. We need to, as an industry, celebrate and spotlight those who were brave enough to pave their own way and a path for us to follow. Josephine started from the bottom with nothing and broke through the glass ceiling. She boldly did the unexpected with everything she attempted to do. That, to me, is very inspiring and the perfect message for a Broadway musical.What is it about her work that makes her such an enduring icon today?Josephine Baker boldly transcended her race, her sex and her color to become a global icon. She went from a poor little girl living in a boxcar in the slums of St. Louis to the star of the Folies-Bergère and one of the wealthiest and most revered women in Paris. Josephine traveled across the world to follow her dreams and through all of the success and fame remained true to herself and her heart – she is truly timeless."

27,MEDIA,Nick Denton: Peter Thiel Is A ‘Thin-Skinned Billionaire',Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gawker-founder-open-letter-to-peter-thiel_us_5747861ee4b055bb1171c2e5,The Gawker Media founder hit back at Thiel in an open letter.,2016-05-27,"Nick Denton, founder of Gawker Media, had some strong words for his newly revealed nemesis, tech billionaire Peter Thiel.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574786e9130000fb07382e17.jpeg?cache=oicWxuJcKh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Gawker Media founder Nick Denton slammed tech billionaire Peter Thiel on Thursday for bankrolling lawsuits that could cripple the digital news operation, and challenged him to a formal debate about journalism.Denton issued his scathing -- and lengthy -- critique in an open letter to Thiel posted on Gawker, the media company’s self-titled news site.He argued that Thiel was preying on a small, independent media outlet to settle personal scores, rather than performing a benevolent service for the subjects of Gawker’s more questionable stories, as Thiel contended in The New York Times.“Among the million posts published by Gawker and other properties since the company was founded, there have undoubtedly been occasions we overstepped the line,” Denton wrote. “In offsetting the fawning coverage of tech luminaries and others, sometimes our stories swing too far for my taste toward snark.”“But this vindictive decade-long campaign is quite out of proportion to the hurt you claim,” he concluded.The media guru went on to note that lawsuits with Thiel’s financial backing have not just targeted Gawker Media, but gone after individual journalists as well, saddling them with unpayable expenses and other stresses.“Peter, this is twisted,” Denton wrote. “Even were you to succeed in bankrupting Gawker Media, the writers you dislike, and me, just think what it will mean.”He warned that Thiel's actions were likely to heighten public fears about the “unaccountable power of the billionaire class.""""Now you show yourself as a thin-skinned billionaire who, despite all the success and public recognition that a person could dream of, seethes over criticism and plots behind the scenes to tie up his opponents in litigation he can afford better than they.""Denton also invited Thiel to an “open and public debate” with him about the nature of journalism, either in person -- “under the auspices of the Committee to Protect Journalists,” a nonprofit to which Thiel has donated -- or on a ""neutral"" online platform.Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and a Facebook board member, was exposed on Wednesday as the financial sponsor of a lawsuit brought celebrity wrestler Hulk Hogan and suits by a number of other story subjects against the New York-based company.Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140-million penalty against Gawker Media in March for violating his privacy with its publication of a sex video he made with the wife of a friend. Denton has expressed confidence the decision will be overturned on appeal.Thiel’s crusade against Gawker Media began in 2007 when its now-defunct, Silicon Valley-centered blog Valleywag mentioned that the investor was gay. Thiel claims the post outed him, telling the New York Times on Wednesday that the incident and other stories about friends “ruined people’s lives for no reason.”Thiel estimated that his investment in lawsuits against Gawker has cost him $10 million thus far.The case has pitted concerns about privacy rights against First Amendment advocates, with Gawker claiming the tape was newsworthy and its publication was protected under freedom of the press. But if forced to pay up, it's unclear whether the edgy digital media company, whose sites also include Gizmodo, Jezebel, Deadspin, Kotaku, Jalopnik and Lifehacker, would survive in its current form.The New York Post reported on Thursday that Denton is seeking a buyer for Gawker Media. He had already sold a minority stake in the company in January, which brought in new cash for its legal costs.Denton’s missive is the latest public twist in an escalating fracas over Thiel’s involvement that has captivated the media industry this week.Denton first aired his suspicion to the New York Times on Tuesday that Bollea’s suit was backed by a wealthy billionaire, speculating that the person came from Silicon Valley. Bollea’s lawyers waived a claim that would have allowed Gawker to use its insurance to help cover legal costs and damages, Denton noted, an unusual move for a plaintiff.Sources came forward shortly thereafter confirming Denton’s hunch and naming Thiel as the culprit.Admitting his role as benefactor, Thiel argued in his Wednesday interview with the Times that the suit will not have a chilling effect on the press.“I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations,” he said. “I think much more highly of journalists than that. It’s precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker.”Thiel’s detractors fear his activism-driven funding of litigation provides a model for other vain billionaires to silence media outlets whose coverage they dislike.Thiel is an outspoken libertarian with more than a few eccentric pet projects and fringe political views. He argued in 2009 that women receiving the right to vote undermined democracy.The tech investor is a pledged delegate for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump."
28,GREEN,Trump Probably Can't Kill The World's Plan To Fight Global Warming,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-paris-climate-deal_us_57488301e4b03ede4414b3df,But he's sure going to try.,2016-05-27,"French climate ambassador Laurence Tubiana, right, told reporters that governments feel ""quite calm"" about the fate of the Paris climate agreement.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5748877e1600002a00f94ae9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump says that if he's elected president he'll scrap the global scheme to combat climate change and come up with a solution of his own. Depending on whom you talk to, this is either a terrifying prospect or a fool's errand.In a Thursday speech about energy policy, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee doubled down on his pledge to completely rework the international climate agreement that 195 countries, including the U.S., adopted in December.Earlier this month, Trump, who has denied the existence of climate change, told Reuters that, “at a minimum,” he would be “renegotiating those agreements.” He elaborated Thursday on his reasons for wanting to do so.“Foreign bureaucrats are going to be controlling what we’re using and what we’re doing on our land and in our country. No way,” Trump said during a press event ahead of his speech at an oil industry conference in North Dakota.For the record, carbon emissions reductions that countries agree to make under the Paris deal are completely voluntary. One of the main criticisms of the agreement is that there's little way to enforce those reductions.Trump didn't offer details Thursday on what a new climate accord would look like. While some foreign leaders have expressed alarm at his desire to renegotiate the deal, at least a few top-level climate officials don’t seemed too worried about the candidate's pledge to rework an agreement diplomats spent years crafting. Most governments feel “quite calm” that the accord will go into effect, Laurence Tubiana, France’s climate ambassador, told reporters Thursday, per climate change news site Climate Home.Tubiana implied that the international community might not need the U.S. to follow through on the country's commitment to slash its emissions by 28 percent by 2025 in order to help keep planetary warming below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Other countries have pledged to reduce various amounts depending on how much they currently emit and what they feel is feasible given their national circumstances.“There’s a vision of what we have to do,” Tubiana said. “It was based on national decisions. Of course we want the U.S. on board, but it will not derail the orientation different countries have taken.”Tubiana’s assessment might be overly optimistic. The ongoing participation of the U.S, as well as other large greenhouse gas emitters like China, will likely be crucial to ensuring that the world meets its emissions reductions goals, according to experts.But Tubiana isn’t the only top-ranking diplomat to dismiss Trump’s position on the climate agreement.Christiana Figueres, the outgoing head of the United Nations' top governing body on climate change, told Bloomberg this week that it’s highly unlikely Trump would be able renegotiate a new climate deal if elected.“First, you'd have to get support from U.S. citizens for that, and I doubt that would happen,” Figueres said.Even if Americans wanted a President Trump to rework the deal, she added, “you'd have to get 195 other countries back at the negotiating table with a willingness to renegotiate, and from someone who was involved the first time, I can only say, good luck with that.""The U.S. could simply walk away from the existing deal, but doing so would risk tarnishing U.S. credibility abroad, according to experts. Such a decision “would almost certainly trigger a major diplomatic backlash,” Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the nonprofit and nonpartisan Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, told reporters in April.  The U.S. is the world's second largest emitter of carbon dioxide, behind China, and is responsible for 16 percent of all carbon spewed into the atmosphere since 1990. But despite dragging its feet for decades, the U.S. recently has taken significant steps to reduce its contributions to climate change.Federal and state tax credits are helping to expand renewable energy production, and President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, though currently tied up in the courts, promises to drastically cut carbon emissions from power plants. In addition, cheap natural gas is precipitating a switch away from coal-fired power generation in the country. If elected, Trump could reverse some of the gains made during the Obama administration, but he might not be able to fundamentally change the direction of energy policy in the country, an unnamed State Department official told the Guardian this week. Trump, who said Thursday he’d like to keep energy costs low, probably wouldn't raise natural gas prices, the official said. Nor is he likely to find much support for revoking tax incentives for renewable energy. Not everyone is so sanguine about Trump’s position on the climate deal, however. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a speech earlier this month that electing a climate denier to the presidency could derail the Paris agreement. Indeed it seems possible that Trump could throw a wrench in the U.S.’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions, which in turn might affect the way the rest of the world views the climate accord. Trump vowed on Thursday to revoke President Obama’s climate change rules, resuscitate the scrapped Keystone XL oil pipeline and stop contributing to emissions reductions programs abroad. If he were to make good on those promises, it could hinder the country’s ability to meet emissions targets under the Paris deal.And if the U.S. fails to live up to its commitment, there’s a chance the entire deal could unravel. When diplomats reconvene in five years to renew and ratchet up their emissions targets, other countries might choose to avoid aggressive emissions reductions if they see that the U.S. has failed to meet its pledge. Fabius laid out the threat in stark terms: “If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption,” he said. “We must not think that everything is settled.”A representative for Donald Trump could not be reached for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

""We're going to do all this while taking proper regard for rational environmental concerns.""It was Trump's first speech detailing the energy policies he would advance if elected president. He received loud applause from the crowd of oil executives.The comments painted a stark contrast between the New York billionaire and his Democratic rivals for the White House, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who advocate a sharp turn away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy technologies to combat climate change.Trump slammed both rivals in his speech, saying their policies would kill jobs and force the United States ""to be begging for oil again"" from Middle East producers.""It's not going to happen. Not with me,"" he said.Trump's comments drew quick criticism from environmental advocates, who called his proposals ""frightening.""""Trump’s energy policies would accelerate climate change, protect corporate polluters who profit from poisoning our air and water, and block the transition to clean energy that is necessary to strengthen our economy and protect our climate and health,"" said Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist.But industry executives cheered the stance.""It’s simple. If Trump wins, oil field workers will be happy. If Clinton wins, oil workers will be unhappy,"" said Derrick Alexander, an operations manager at oilfield services firm Integrated Productions Services.Trump hit Clinton hard in his speech, saying the former secretary of state would be more aggressive than Obama on regulations. He repeated several times Clinton’s March comments that her policies would put coal miners out of work.""Hillary Clinton's agenda is job destruction,"" Trump said.CANCEL PARISTrump said slashing regulation would help the United States achieve energy independence and reduce America's reliance on Middle Eastern producers. ""Imagine a world in which oil cartels will no longer use energy as a weapon,"" he said.The United States currently produces about 55 percent of the oil it uses, with another quarter of the total coming from Canada and Mexico, and less than 20 percent coming from OPEC, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics.Trump's advisers, including U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, have said they suggested Trump examine the role of OPEC in the global oil price slump since 2014, which has contributed to the demise of a handful of smaller U.S. oil companies. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have declined to cut production to support prices.Until Thursday, Trump had been short on details of his energy policy. He has said he believes global warming is a hoax, that his administration would revive the U.S. coal industry, and that he supports hydraulic fracturing - an environmentally controversial drilling technique that has triggered a boom in U.S. production.Earlier this month, he told Reuters in an interview that he would renegotiate ""at a minimum"" the U.N. global climate accord agreed by 195 countries in Paris last December, saying he viewed the deal as bad for U.S. business.He took that a step further in North Dakota. ""We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement,"" he said.Trump also promised he would invite Canadian pipeline company TransCanada (TRP.TO) to reapply to build the Keystone XL pipeline into the United States, reversing a decision by Obama to block the project over environmental concerns.""I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits,"" Trump said. ""That's how we're going to make our country rich again.""Trump's pledge briefly sent TransCanada's shares 29 Canadian cents higher to C$54.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, but the stock quickly leveled back off and close up 2 Canadian cents at C$53.86.In response to Trump's promise that he would seek more profits from the pipeline, TransCanada spokesman James Millar noted the project would create jobs, offer major contracts to U.S. suppliers and provide tens of millions in taxes for state coffers.""The pipeline will benefit American workers longer term as the companies they work for have signed contracts to ship and refine oil through Keystone XL,"" Millar said in an email.(Additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Andrew Hay and Tiffany Wu)"
30,LATINO VOICES,Maná Frontman Says Donald Trump ‘Is Creating Racism Not Seen Since Hitler’,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mana-frontman-says-donald-trump-is-against-all-latinos-not-just-undocumented_us_57485acbe4b0dacf7ad4a4e7,"""A guy who does reality shows can’t lead a country.""",2016-05-27,"Mexican bands Maná and Los Tigres Del Norte hold up a sign that reads ""Latinos United Don't Vote For Racists"" onstage during the 16th annual Latin Grammy Awards.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57485ec61200002500894b33.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mexican rock group Maná and its frontman, Fher Olvera, are deeply concerned about what the 2016 presidential election could mean for Latinos.“We see thousands and millions of people in trouble, millions of people who they want to deport for working, for doing the jobs in the United States that are harder and more complicated and tougher,” Olvera told The Huffington Post in a phone conversation from the band’s headquarters in Guadalajara, Mexico. ""And you can’t do that to people who are putting the bread on the table, you can’t do that.”Olvera, 56, and the Grammy award-winning band have spent several years advocating for fair immigration reform and the singer says their political presence in the United States has always been driven by the group’s humanitarian concerns. Still, they endorsed President Barack Obama when he sought re-election in 2012 and have continued to support his administration over the years, even recently performing at the White House to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.Maná hasn’t endorsed a presidential candidate in this election, but it has taken a clear stance against GOP candidate Donald Trump. In November, the group joined fellow Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte on the stage at the Latin Grammy Awards holding a “Don’t Vote For Racists” sign.Trump is the biggest threat to the Latino community regardless of immigration status, according to Olvera. And the singer has a message for Latinos thinking about not casting their ballot this November.“‘You have to get your act together,’ that’s the message,” he said. “Because Trump isn’t just against undocumented immigrants, he’s against the entire community. [He’s against] anyone who has the name Castro, Gonzalez, Perez; anyone whose physical appearance includes skin that’s a little darker or tan. He doesn’t like it. And those are things that are going to complicate everyone’s life.”For Olvera, Trump’s lack of political experience isn’t even what’s most concerning to him. “A guy who does reality shows can’t lead a country, much less the most powerful country in the world,” he said. Even worse, he adds, is the hate the Republican candidate has been spewing during his campaign.“I think you have to be very blind to not realize the undertone of his message,” he said. “For me, from my perspective, Trump is a racist person. If he’s started to speak well of Latinos it’s because he needs their vote. But I think that Latinos aren’t stupid. I think Latinos are reading between the lines and understanding that he doesn’t like Latinos and that he wants white supremacy.”Olvera went as far as to compare Trump to Hitler, something several pundits and figures have done over the course of the GOP candidate’s presidential campaign. In the past, Trump has responded by calling such comparisons ""ridiculous.""“Trump is creating racism not seen since Hitler,” he added. “He’s making white people see us [Latinos] in a negative light, because they’ve started seeing us negatively. When you talk to them in Spanish or in broken English, like mine, they don’t look at you the same.”But Maná is doing a lot more than just talking about the importance of the Latino vote in this election. In February, the band announced they would be collaborating with Voto Latino and other grassroots advocacy groups to launch the Latino Power Tour, a national concert tour focused on inspiring the Latino community to register and vote. The tour will kick off on Sept. 9, in San Diego and currently includes 17 cities across the United States.“Latinos can move presidents now,” Olvera told HuffPost. “They can make the difference in the United States, and they have to take advantage of that because the vote of a Latino who sweeps the park, a very honorable job I might add, and the vote of a senator is the same. It has the same weight and the same value, so it’s important to go out and vote so the most human political party, the one with the best conditions and the one that is willing to push for fair immigration reform [will be elected].”Ultimately, Olvera says the power is in the hands of the people.“[In Mexico], we are always complaining about the government, that it’s bad and that the president is this and that, but it’s our fault... we elected him,” he said, emphasizing that the same holds true in the United States. “Latinos have to seriously get their act together and not be lazy and go vote, because you’re the architect of your own destiny and every country, every nation has the leaders it deserves.”"

""When we meet ... next year, I anticipate reporting on the decisions of a full bench.""Ginsburg's remarks at the annual Second Circuit Judicial Conference, which she attends regularly, are the boldest by a justice so far on the dynamics of a Supreme Court that's one member short. Her insights give the public a bird's eye view of high-profile cases the court has heard, decided and is still deliberating -- including those where no final decision could be reached due to an even split.""That means no opinions and no precedential value,"" Ginsburg said, according to a transcript of her speech. ""An equal division is essentially the same as a denial of review.""Ginsburg's desire for a full, nine-member court may be wishful thinking, in light of staunch Republican opposition to granting a Senate hearing or a vote for Merrick Garland, the appeals judge President Barack Obama nominated to take Scalia's seat at the high court. If the GOP blockade persists until the next president takes office, a new justice might not be seated until after June 2017, the end of the court's next term.Ginsburg singled out two recent cases where the justices have deadlocked 4-4: a conservative challenge to public sector unions, and a religious case that sought to undermine contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.On the Obamacare case, the court was roundly criticized for issuing a meager three-page decision that failed to clarify whether a requirement of the health care law that faith-based nonprofits sign a form noting objections to contraception violates their rights under federal law. The practical effect of this quasi-ruling is more litigation and uncertainty for the dozens of parties involved -- and a possible new trip to the Supreme Court later. Ginsburg's comments came a day after Chief Justice John Roberts, speaking at a similar conference in West Virginia, said he's doing his best to try to get his colleagues to find common ground on contentious issues.""I try to achieve as much consensus as I can,"" Roberts said, according to The Associated Press, sounding a bit more optimistic about the status quo. ""We kind of have to have a commitment as a group. I think we spend a fair amount of time — maybe a little more than others in the past — talking about things, talking them out. It sometimes brings you a bit closer together.""But recent action or inaction by the court shows otherwise. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight, published last week, noted that the court is on track to have its lightest caseload in seven decades, and that none of the cases it will hear beginning in October is particularly newsworthy. During its usual round of orders on Monday, the court again refused to hear any new cases.This comes amid debate among legal scholars and experts on whether it's a good thing for the Supreme Court to be understaffed. In the meantime, the justices have four major decisions remaining on their current docket before they recess for the summer: the legality of Obama's executive actions on immigration, affirmative action at public universities, regulations on abortion providers, and the reach of federal anti-corruption laws.For an educated guess on how the Supreme Court might rule on some of those issues, don't look to Justice Stephen Breyer. Earlier this week, he added his voice to the conversation by noting, ambivalently, that he and his benchmates ""may"" or ""may not"" deadlock in the pending cases."
