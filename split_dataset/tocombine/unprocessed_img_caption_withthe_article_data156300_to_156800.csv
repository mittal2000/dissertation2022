As the creative director of 360 Design Events, I'm a big proponent of incorporating a philanthropic angle into your event -- it takes the occasion beyond one night (or day) of celebration, raises awareness of whatever cause you might choose to highlight, and of course, makes everybody involved feel good. Giving is in -- and that's a trend I can get behind. I'd recommend finding a cause or organization that's a good fit with your own and the event you are producing, so that it feels relevant to your guests -- not like an awkward afterthought. Here are a few ideas of how you can integrate giving back into your next event. Raise a gavel (quietly) Big-ticket fundraisers stage silent auctions all the time. Guests peruse donated items at the event and write down a maximum bid for the displayed merchandise. (Suggested values are often indicated, as are starting bids.) Silent auctions can be a lot of work -- think calling lots of people and asking for donated merchandise -- but if you can easily acquire a fun or sexy prize through a friend of your company or organization, it could be worth doing. Or raise it loudly  The same work that goes into staging a silent auction applies to a live one as well, so hitting up that concert promoter board member for backstage passes, convincing your power travel agent relative that a donated package would be good marketing, etc. might come into play. Beyond that, live auctions can be a lot of fun in the right crowd. That is: one that will be into spirited, live bidding and open to publicly parting with some money for a good cause. If that doesn't sound like your group, skip it. Also crucial: a good auctioneer; a bad one will ensure the stunt goes over like a lead balloon.Take a chance  Another way to raise money with a high-ticket item or experience is a good old-fashioned raffle. This fundraising tactic is flexible in that those guests who want to give a lot, can do so, while those who may have less extra cash but still want to contribute can buy a single ticket. You also have the option of selling tickets before and/or during the event, and when you will select the winner. Skip the swag  How often have we heard people complain about all the stuff they get in gift bags? Use whatever money you might have earmarked for a thank you gift and donate it to your cause of choice, notifying guests with signage as they leave, a note in the program, a tasteful table card, etc. Change it up Most people can't shell out several hundred (or thousand) dollars for a fancy auction item or benefit ticket, but everyone has spare change -- and they're often happy to part with it. Particularly effective if you're holding an event with a large number of attendees, collecting spare change from guests can be an easy way to raise a surprisingly large amount of money with minimal burden on any one individual. They key to this strategy is to devise fun and creative ways to collect those loose nickels, dimes and quarters from your guests. Also to consider: how, if appropriate, you'll let people know how much was raised. Give the goods  A holiday tradition in many communities, but perfectly appropriate any time of year: ask guests to bring a canned good to donate to a local food bank, or a book to donate to an after school program. This has the added bonus of your crowd being able to physically see the good they are doing!Shine a light  Giving back doesn't always have to mean giving money. In fact, spreading the word about an organization and creating awareness of the work they do can be worth even more than a one-time monetary gift. Select a non-profit that is a good fit with your organization or group and showcase its work with a very brief video presentation, a profile in a program, etc. Donate your leftovers  As I wrote in my post about producing sustainable events, lots of organizations are happy to take what you don't use (or use for a few hours) and help it find its way to people and organizations in need. I'm particularly fond on Materials For the Arts (full disclosure: I'm on the board!), a non-profit organization that takes unneeded items from businesses and individuals and redirects them to schools and agencies with arts programming. But there are other non-profits that work with the event industry as well, such as City Harvest, which will pick up your unused food, and Flower Power, which rescues floral elements and delivers them to healthcare facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes.

1,WELLNESS,5 Motivational Ways to Age Backwards,"Rob White, Contributor

The truth is actually that anyone can roll the clock back. All you need is a motivational mindset. Then you, too, can start counting the calendar backwards at each birthday.",2013-04-29,"Boy riding bike at beach with reflection in Hendaya beach, France.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1046240000510094edb5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You've probably heard expressions like ""60 is the new 40."" The truth is actually that anyone can roll the clock back. All you need is a motivational mindset. Then you, too, can start counting the calendar backwards at each birthday.Beyond good diet and exercise -- which are critical for anyone at any age -- getting motivated is the key to aging well. Here are five ways to adopt a motivational mindset, launch your own age rollback, and engage the world at any age:1. Change your WOE to WOW ratio. There's nothing more de-motivating than living in a world of WOE (which is an acronym that stands for What On Earth). The world of WOE is dark and consists largely of finding fault and blame. WOE is like a leech that sucks the life spirit out of you. Its opposite, WOW (which means Wonderfully Obsessed with Winning) infuses every moment with excitement about the world. WOW is that frame of mind that motivates you to fully embrace whatever you're doing. No, you can't get rid of WOE -- it's part of the human condition. But you can choose to minimize the presence of WOE and focus on WOW; the key is to become more aware of WOE's presence and to consciously opt for WOW. Try it. Keep a notebook of how much time you spend in a WOE state versus a WOW state. Then, set a goal to focus on WOW for 15 minutes as you start your day. Soon, it will become a habit, and you won't even have to think about it.2. Get curious. Many studies have shown that the more you flex your mind as you age, the healthier your mind will be. In addition to engaging in brain-cell building activities like puzzles, ask questions about how things work and why things are. Nothing motivates like a good question. Find a headline story each day that you want to learn more about. Find a topic each week that you want to research through books or using online resources. Adopt the curiosity of a child. The more new things you learn, the more you'll be motivated to discover new areas of interest.3. Invest in the moment. It's so easy to look back with regrets or nostalgia that we forget to see the joy of what's happening in the present. Ditto for spending time gazing into the future with apprehension or fear. Try an experiment: every day, spend five minutes focusing on the here and now, and allow yourself to feel totally invested in whatever you're doing, whether it's work or play. Be conscious that you're in the moment. When you get comfortable with that notion, expand the time you spend in the here and now each day.4. Let go and take a higher perspective. When you were younger, you were probably in the mode of striving for more -- more money, more status, more security, or more attention. More anything. As you age, that pressure starts to diminish. But if you're like most of us, you still likely cling to the notion that you're in some kind of a race that you must win. Let it go! When you stop competing against others you'll be motivated to appreciate those things that really matter and you probably already have.5. Do things that put you in a good mood. Good moods don't just happen. They come about from doing things that make us feel happy, things that we enjoy. When we were younger, it was easy to feel good because we weren't shy about letting our hair down and having fun. You can recapture that habit now. Incorporate at least one thing a day into your routine that puts you in a good mood whether it's taking a walk, completing a puzzle, or pulling out a board game or a deck of cards with friends.. When you're feeling good, you'll likely be more motivated to try new things. And you can almost hear the clock ticking backwards.Be aware that a motivational mindset doesn't come overnight. But the more receptive you are to it, the more you'll enjoy waking up every morning -- and flipping another page back on your internal calendar!For more by Rob White, click here.For more on success and motivation, click here."

Being one of the most common fruits, it's hard to make them exciting. Sure, banana cream pies are pretty great. And nothing will replace the nostalgic taste of a banana split. But when all the dessert options are on the table, bananas don't really stand a chance. Or so we thought. And we were sure proven wrong when we took a look to see what others (with more imagination) were making with bananas. Bakers had the smart sense to see the potential in this every day fruit and have made some amazing cakes, puddings and even popsicles.

Most restaurants in India clearly distinguish and market themselves as being either 'non-vegetarian', 'vegetarian', or pure vegetarian'. Vegetarian restaurants abound, usually many vegetarian options are available. Animal-based ingredients (other than milk and honey) such as lard, gelatin and meat stock are not used in traditional cuisine.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d19672000002d00fdd44d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sari Kamin HRN StafferRecently, on her weekly Heritage Radio Network program, ""A Taste of the Past,"" Linda Pellacio interviewed Rynn Berry, an author and historical advisor to the North American Vegetarian Society.Berry has been a vegetarian since learning, as a teenager, that animals experience anxiety before slaughter. His vegetarianism has since evolved into a vegan lifestyle, which means he excludes all animal products, including honey, not just from his diet but also from his clothing.With Pellacio, Berry discussed the trajectory of vegetarianism, which has been a documented part of history since the sixth century B.C. According to Berry, the first vegetarian society was founded by the ancient Greek mathematician, Pythagoras (a key player in ninth grade geometry). Not only did Pythagoras demystify triangles, he also spread the gospel of the Buddha, a contemporary of Pythagoras who inspired him personally to practice non-violent vegetarianism. For Pythagoras, abstaining from meat was rooted in his spiritual values; nutrition would not become a factor in the diet until much later in history. In fact, a diet void of any animal products was actually called a ""Pythagorean"" diet until 1944, when Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society, coined the word vegan. Vegetarianism was first documented in 1848, most likely by an Oxford Scholar.Berry has written several books on vegetarianism, including Famous Vegetarians. Notable meat-abstainers include Benjamin Franklin, whom Berry described as ""the only founding father to have a fling with vegetarianism,"" as well as George Bernard Shaw, who was famously told by a team of doctors that he needed to eat meat or starve. Not only did he not starve, he lived until the age of 94.Other vegetarians of the 19th century have had the legacy of their names enter the industrial food lexicon of today. John Harvey Kellogg, a Seventh-Day Adventist and the inventor of corn flakes, created the cereal as an alternative meatless breakfast option. Sylvester Graham, a Presbyterian minister who preached for temperance, whole grains, and vegetarian diets, created a cracker he believed was a nutritionally superior product. S'mores enthusiasts can rest assured that the modern version of the beloved campfire treat, the graham cracker, bears little resemblance to the original prototype.The trajectory of vegetarianism is particularly interesting, especially in America, where history has recorded its renaissance on several occasions. The early vegetarians who I have named in this article were all inspired by their respective religions to cling to a meat-free diet. Their goals may have varied, but the common impetus was a spiritual sense of clarity that was thought to be achieved by eating a diet void of flesh. It wasn't until the 20th century that America embraced vegetarianism in a secular fashion. The baby-boomer generation, spurred by the violence of the 1960's and disparaged by threats of imminent ecological disasters, largely embraced a diet inspired by ecology and a desire to get closer to the Earth. By the time Frances Moore Lappé's iconic book, Diet for a Small Planet (1971), was published, vegetarianism had found its way into mainstream America's collective consciousness.Today we are seeing a vegetarian redux. On one hand, nutrition is worshipped in society and a meat-free diet has become an acceptable entry point into a healthy lifestyle. Even extreme versions of vegetarianism, such as veganism and raw-food diets, have begun to shed their stigma. William Jefferson Clinton, who was not a founding father but is a beloved former president, has been outspoken about his drastic transition from a fast-food fueled diet to a strict vegan one. Rynn Berry would refer to Clinton as a ""coronary vegetarian,"" someone who moves to a plant-based diet on the recommendation of their doctor after having a heart attack or a major procedure. Possibly inspired by their former president, or perhaps just riding the current trend wave, the American people have listened to a litany of testaments from celebrities who swear by their new meat-free diets. Rarely are ethics the impetus, and the nutrition-focused impulse has created a cross section of players on the corner of ""I want my meat"" and ""I want to feel good about it too."" This new business of wanting to stay healthy without sacrificing taste cravings has inspired movements such as ""Meatless Mondays,"" which encourages a commitment to eating lower on the food chain without having to go cold turkey. Or cold tofurkey, as the case may be. The ethical devotion to a cruelty-free diet, we can see, has been tempered and popularized by a re-shift of focus. Yes, we still care about animals, but now that we know that we can consume creatures that have lived healthy and happy lives, we no longer have to stress about their blood staying on our hands. It is important to note that only five percent of Americans identify themselves as vegetarians and for the majority of the population who are meat eaters, there are other ways to impact the environment and one's own health in a powerful and positive way. Pushing for breed diversity in our meat supply and purchasing only sustainably raised livestock are effective and important choices that meat-eaters should consider. Vegetarianism in itself is inherently complicated; the deep relationships between the livestock and dairy industries make for considerable debate when choosing to exclude meat from a diet but not cheese and milk. Regardless of the choices you make in your diet, the more the dots are connected between health, compassion and ecology, the more nourishing your diet will become for your mind and your body.Listen to the original interview between Linda Pellacio and Rynn Berry here.To learn more about Rynn Berry and his books on vegetarianism, click here."

It may be a small backyard where you lovingly nurture your veggies, fruit trees or flowers. It may be a 10x12 plot in a community garden or the section of a public garden that you tend. But no matter how small or large your garden therapy retreat, it can be a healing sanctuary, offering balm to the over-stressed, over-networked modern soul. A true garden retreat is different from a merely practical place where you grow a few plants for food or try to impress the neighbors and raise your property values. There's something of the sacred about it -- a communion with nature, the plant spirits and the beauty of this amazing, mysterious universe we're a tiny part of. In this kind of garden, the bird bath, the wind chimes and the found garden ""sculpture"" or special stones aren't incidental -- they're important elements in the creation of a truly healing retreat. Beauty, as archetypal psychologist James Hillman often reminds us in his many books, is soul food. So for our therapy gardens we want to choose plants and objects that call to us with great attraction. Over the last decade, my husband and I have created a green living space full of beings and objects we fell in love with. It was the fruit trees that called to him and the roses that sang to me, so we have a permaculture backyard food forest full of fruit trees, heritage roses and other beautiful and tasty plants, creating a retreat that is both productive of delicious, super-fresh food for the body and year-round seasons of beauty soothing to the soul. One of the special benefits of a garden retreat is that it slows us down to nature's pace. We learn to reconnect with the seasons and the elements. We are humbled by the simple forces that determine events in our little world. We are not in control. The rain, wind, sun and moon have their way here. And we share our space with millions of other living beings, small and not so small: the birds, insects, animals and soil creatures who were here long before we arrived and will probably continue long after we are gone. This is their land; we are privileged to share it with them.In their book Your Brain on Nature: the Science of Nature's Influence on Your Health, Happiness, and Vitality, Eva Selhub, M.D. and Alan Logan, N.D. outline the science that backs up our personal experience of the healing power of nature-connection -- even if it's just outside our back door. Study after study suggests that putting people back in touch with the rest of nature has a multitude of benefits for body, mind and soul.Spring is a great time to start creating your own special garden. Even a few pots of herbs can provide healing and nourishment. Gardens -- even tiny ones -- can lower anxiety and lift our mood. And there's no way to quantify the intangible benefits and raised spirits that come from spending time enjoying and nurturing plants, animals, birds, fungi, bees, ladybugs and all the wondrous creation-in-miniature that live with you in your own special garden.I feel that our gardens have a special function in times of stress.
