Travel Through a Local Lens",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cape-town-south-africa-tr_us_5b9dac01e4b03a1dcc8b3564,Global Yodel caught up with Cape Town local Anthea Hartzenberg and asked her about life in South Africa.,2013-12-09,2013-11-20-CapeTown_Sunset_AntheaHartzenberg_Yodel1260x945.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-20-CapeTown_Sunset_AntheaHartzenberg_Yodel1260x945-thumb.jpg,"Camps Bay is only one of many beaches dotting Cape Town's Atlantic Seaboard and is a good place to watch the day end. On this clear, sunny day in June I decided to head out to watch the sunset, something for me that never gets old. There's a magic in seeing the end of the day as signified by the setting sun. As we made our way to the beach, I was enthralled by the way the sunlight kept peering through the trees. Camps Bay is ten minutes from the Cape Town city centre and there are many restaurants and clubs along its main road.Global Yodel caught up with Cape Town local Anthea Hartzenberg and asked her about life in South Africa.Global Yodel: Tell us about the place you live:Anthea Hartzenberg: I live in the city centre of Cape Town, right across from the famous company gardens. I love discovering new angles and places in the city -- from abandoned parking lots, to missed details on buildings. I'm lucky to live ten minutes from the ocean -- family friendly walks on the Sea Point promenade, eating or relaxing on the Atlantic Seaboard are all things I enjoy. Of course, Table Mountain is forever watching over me, flanked by Lion's Head. Newlands Forrest is absolutely magical and very close to town. For picture perfect beauty, I head out to the wine-lands, which never ceases to amaze.GY: What is a perfect day in Cape Town?AH: My perfect day is spent walking around my city. I like to start the company gardens, walking down Government Avenue toward the city centre. There's always a variety of people here, from the homeless, to the style savvy, fitness freaks and lovers. Once in the city centre, I like to immerse myself in the sights and sounds and smells -- curry from Eastern Food Bazaar, cars and trucks moving up and down the road, people in conversation, the smell of fresh flowers from the flower sellers, the lights of McDonald's or KFC, the bustle of the crowds as they cross Adderley Street. From here I move through the myriad of side roads to Long, Loop or Bree dotted with galleries and African restaurants (Little Ethiopia etc). I like peering into the smaller shops in the alleys, they're full of character. Up Long Street, past all the quirky fashion stores I would head toward Kloof for an eclectic mix of people, shops and restaurants. I'll end my day with a burger at either Knead in Kloof or Hudson's. Yumm.GY: What is the best thing about your spot?AH: I live in the middle of Cape Town. Walking to the office in the morning is a joy. There's Table Mountain in the distance, beautiful landscapes in the Company Gardens and watching the city come to life.GY: What is the worst?AH: Grime in lower town.GY: What would be surprising about this place to an outsider?AH: Contrast. Cape Town is a city of contrasts -- the beautiful oceans, the grime in the city centre, the wonderful views in the city and the crumbling buildings on the periphery.Check out GlobalYodel.com for more Cape Town tips and local insight from around the world.

But I just looked up my bank balance and things are fine. How is that possible?

How am I managing to live by the beach in exotic Southeast Asia and still spend way less than I would in the U.S.?People often ask me how I can afford to live abroad in some of the most beautiful places on earth, so I'd like to share the financial aspect of traveling, to show you that it's obtainable. In fact, you should be able to live like a (modest) king for less than $1,500 a month, or $50 a day!First off, there is a HUGE difference between being on vacation and living abroad. That image you have of sitting around on a beach chair all day with a coconut drink in your hand at a luxurious resort? Get that out of your head, because I live as simply and humbly as a local, but that doesn't mean I can't still enjoy all the benefits of my new home. How much do you spend every month in the United States? If you add up mortgage or rent, utilities, insurance, your car and gas, food and clothing, etc., the average budget for one comes to around $3,200. Now, let's look at my budget as I travel through some of the most beautiful locales in the world -- like Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines:Rent: $360/month, $12/day. One of the biggest advantages of living abroad, not just vacationing, is the savings you get when you rent an apartment. Hotels are expensive, but simple, clean, safe (nothing fancy) accommodations might run $250-$400 a month for one person. Often times utilities are included, or it still lands within that price range. Currently, I'm paying $360 a month in the Philippines on the island of Boracay, only a few blocks from one of the nicest beaches in the world!Food: $300/month, $10/day. You save a ton of money staying out of the tourist trap restaurants, where meals might cost you $10-$12 each. Instead, find out where the locals eat - the food is usually great and a meal will cost you $3-$5. In Vietnam, the best place to eat is on the street, where a full amazing meal might cost you $2! Or, you can brave the local market and cook for yourself, saving even more.Medical insurance: $120/month, $4/day.  It's ironic that one of my largest expenses is something I never use, but I keep my U.S. major medical insurance policy in good standing just in case of emergency. Healthcare can be shockingly inexpensive in foreign countries but the quality of services can also be inconsistent. I once met a Canadian traveller who jumped into the bull ring in Costa Rica during their fiestas (not a good life choice) and was gored badly in the back. An ambulance ride, overnight stay, painkillers, minor surgery, 25 staples and 50 stitches cost him $110.Local transportation: $90/month, $3/day.  You usually don't need a car when you're living abroad. I prefer small towns so I like walking everywhere (it gives me a chance to take in the sites and meet locals.) Or you can utilize cheap transportation like jeepneys, tuk tuks, motorcycle taxis, etc. the locals use for about $1-$2 a ride. Rent a scooter for the month if you want to be more mobile and still keep costs down.Entertainment: $120/month, $4/day. Of course you'll want to go out for beers with friends, a nicer meal, go dancing, or take in a movie from time to time. What you spend on that entertainment varies based on how often you go out and how hard you party, but beers can range from .50 cents to $1.50 on the high side. Of course, the best entertainment is going to the beach (I go in the morning and again at sunset) which is healthy and totally free! Cell phone: $60/month, $2/day. Bring your iPhone or smart phone from the U.S. and just buy a local SIM card. They have plans that include Internet for fairly cheap, but your apartment, every hotel, restaurant, coffee shop, and bar has free wifi these days. I kept my U.S. phone number but suspended service ($10 a month) and had it forwarded to a GoogleVoice number, where I can still get voicemails and make calls online. Gym: $30/month/$1 a day. You can swim, run, and get a great workout on the beach for free, but there is usually a grimy local gym that looks like something out of the 1970's for about $10 a month. I estimated at $1/ day just in case you wanted to bring three friends!Giving back: $120/month, $4/day. One of the best parts of living abroad is integrating into the local community and there's no better way than to be of service. Buy a local person lunch and chat, contribute to the school, or donate at church, but no matter where and what you give, you'll make some connections and lifelong friendships that will be invaluable.Traveling/Tourism expenses: $240 a month, $8/day. You'll want to see all of the best attractions your new home has to offer, so plenty of day trips and weekend jaunts should be on the agenda. Short flights are usually absurdly inexpensive -- I usually pay $30-$50 for flights within the same country! Book a tour to go jump off a waterfall, scuba dive a reef, or trek through ancient ruins. The prices vary widely but you'll get a feel for it -- and the best price -- when you live there, or even can have a local friend show you around. I try to take one ""touristy"" excursion every weekend -- like the sail boat ride around the island I'm planning tomorrow! Total: $1,440/month, or $48/day. That brings us to a daily budget less than $50 a day. Of course you might spend more on food, less on entertainmnet, etc., but for less than $1,500 a month, you should be able to live comfortably -- and have the experience of a lifetime!***For more information on traveling and living abroad, read South of Normal or check out my free blog at NormWrites.com!

3,PARENTING,What Does the Mother of a Dying Child Do to Celebrate a Birthday?,"Maria Kefalas, Contributor
Professor, author, blogger and co-founder, The Calliope Joy Fo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-does-the-mother-of-a-dying-child-do-to-celebrate-a-birthday_us_5b9db2f3e4b03a1dcc8ba9dc,"It's hard not to be angry and bitter when people ask, ""So, what are you doing for your daughter's birthday?"" So, for now, I will keep writing and selling cupcakes.",2013-12-09,2013-12-09-1452308_10202490240207072_969616454_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-09-1452308_10202490240207072_969616454_n.jpg,"As the mother of a terminally-ill child, celebrating my daughter's 4th birthday this year, on December 23rd, provides some unique challenges.My daughter, Calliope Joy, called Cal by our family, has metachromatic leukodystrophy, a neurological disease that has robbed her of the ability to walk, speak or feed herself. Most people have only encountered this disease through the film Lorenzo's Oil. Lorenzo Odone suffered from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a cousin of my daughter's illness. Unlike the film's Hollywood ending suggests, the Odones didn't find a miracle oil to cure any form of leukodystrophy. Eighteen months after diagnosis, my daughter, a child nicknamed ""Happy Feet"" because she was in constant motion, now receives hospice care and cannot hold up her head, sit up, use the toilet, communicate, and she struggles to swallow. The doctors at the world's finest children's hospital have no hope to offer. It is a disease so cruel it makes me envy children with brain tumors.Needless to say, when your little girl can't sing, play, eat cake or open presents, how can you celebrate her birthday? You are not in the mood to send out cheerful invitations or hire a magician. Some alternatives include crying all day, self-medicating with wine or prescription drugs, wailing, pulling your hair out or pretending as best as you can that everything is normal and baking a cake and getting some balloons. I have tried them all. This year, I will try a different approach: selling cupcakes.  My son gave me the idea. When he saw how successful our first fundraiser for The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, an event called Cal's Cupcake Challenge (a more kid-friendly take on the show ""Cupcake Wars""), was, he asked if we sold a million cupcakes, would that be enough to find a cure for his sister's disease?  Photo: Julie ContiI told him I wasn't sure if a million cupcakes would do the trick, but it was a great place to start. After all, $50,000 buys 1,000 hours of medical research.So, my key coping strategy for this birthday will be to sell as many cupcakes as possible to raise money for and awareness of kids with neurological disease. Cupcakes make people smile and they taste delicious. And the cupcakes make it easier for people to listen to our sad story and hear that 20 million American children have some sort of neurological disorder (ranging from autism to epilepsy). Precious few of these diseases have any meaningful treatments or therapies, and not a single one has a cure. So, for my daughter's birthday, I will work to help other children when my child can't be saved.Secretly, I fantasize about how my cupcake sales might change the world. Grief has caused a sort of mania. I want to believe our tragedy has granted me superhuman powers; it feeds this grandiose notion that my daughter's suffering has to mean something. For all that will be lost for her and us, there must be something worthwhile that comes out of this. Nothing I do in her name will ever make up for her suffering and death. Yet, I know I have to do something. And so, this conviction forces me to get up each day and pushes me to talk to doctors, lecture to medical students, write politicians and sit around in parking lots and sell cupcakes. Photo: Caryn SchwartbergAnd you might be surprised to learn that in the midst of this nightmare, I have discovered so much beauty in the generosity of friends and the support of neighbors. So many people with sick children hide. I do not. I share my girl and this story with anyone who is willing to listen. I have to say that being out there and doing something is much better than staying home and feeling sorry for her and for myself.By being out in the world, there is joy and connection and love and meaning to be found. Cal receives letters, cards and books created by children touched by her story, wishing her well and hoping the doctors can find a cure. When Cal goes to visit with children at her older brother's school, kids don't turn away the way their parents do. The children are brave and loving in the purest way, and they touch my daughter's curly hair and say how pretty she is and ask questions about her disease and her. They want to know if they can be her friend.By being out in the world, I found an extraordinary artist who gave me a wonderful gift last year by doing my daughter's portrait. The artist took special care to capture the light in Cal's eyes, since the painter understood that as my daughter becomes blind, her gaze would be more unfocused and distant. Each morning, after I settle my daughter with her nurses when she gets fed and dressed, I stare at the lovely painting of my daughter and dream of how she will always be -- for me -- despite what this disease has taken. Portrait: Perky EdgertonBut, I won't lie, trying to get through another birthday and be brave won't be easy.In my melancholy moments, I rage about how there is nothing to celebrate this year except that my daughter doesn't need a feeding tube and that there have been no grand mal seizures yet. It's hard not to be angry and bitter when people ask, ""So, what are you doing for your daughter's birthday?""So, for now, I will keep writing and selling cupcakes. And maybe, if I am really lucky, one day, some of the money earned from the cupcakes, t-shirts and cupcake-themed merchandise will be part of the research project that makes the breakthrough in epilepsy or autism that we have been waiting for for decades.In the future, I dream, the doctors who diagnosed my daughter will call me to meet the 4-year-old child that they have saved from my daughter's fate.And I will touch this child's hair and gaze into her eyes, and ask her mother what they are doing to celebrate her birthday. And this mother won't weep at the thought of birthdays or need to sell cupcakes to feel better. This will never make up for losing my daughter, but it will have to do.

4,STYLE & BEAUTY,Emmy Rossum: I Love Those Gross Pimple Popping Videos,Dana Oliver,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emmy-rossum-beauty-secrets_us_5b9db49ae4b03a1dcc8bbc47,"On her best travel packing tip... Probably the New York Times crossword puzzle. I don't use an iPhone, I use a Samsung Galaxy",2013-12-09,ELLE's 20th Annual Women In Hollywood Celebration - Red Carpet,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db48f26000033007ffb17.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"On Showtime's hit series ""Shameless,"" Emmy Rossum plays Fiona, the matriarch of the dysfunctional Gallagher clan. She has to do some downright disgusting things, including work a sewage cleanup job, to provide for her five younger siblings. But it turns out that Rossum has a lot in common with her small screen character, as she's not ashamed to reveal her gross quirks like popping her besties' pimples or to share her TMI- experiences with the rest of the world. (We're still LOLing about those gynecologist tweets.)She told us, ""There are very few things that can gross me out, except that fish eating the dead skin from a pedicure. I find that revolting."" While on a break from filming, I caught up with Rossum, a celebrity spokesperson for Restorsea, to find out why she's so into zits, how I could get shiny curls just like hers and what beauty tricks she uses on the set of ""Shameless.""On her obsession with pimple popping videos...I love to watch pimple popping videos. Like if you go on YouTube and search ""biggest pimple popping"" or ""grossest pimple"" or ""world's largest pimple popped,"" I just think that it's one of the funniest things ever. I mean it's nasty, but really funny.On the skincare products she applies religiously...Definitely eye cream and day cream. I like to keep the Restorsea either next to my bed or in the fridge. I'm really into eye cream and keeping that part of my face hydrated, especially as an actor since all of your feelings and emotions come through your eyes. I like to keep that skin soft and supple. [Restorsea] is a natural product that doesn't make me break out, keeps me hydrated and protects my skin so that I can put the money in it, so I won't have to turn to needles later. On how she amps up her skincare routine with kitchen staples...I will sometimes add a drop of olive oil to my Restorsea night cream if I need an added boost of moisture, like during the winter. I'll be traveling to London for Christmas and New Year's, and that's a really kind of snowy and drying place to be, plus traveling on airplanes. On what makes her hair so incredibly shiny...I just use a ton of conditioner and hydration products. I use things like natural coconut oil, and Rodin makes a great hair oil. And I kind of just saturate the ends of my hair and only wash it maybe twice a week.On her best travel packing tip...I use those pill cases, you know the ones that have the days of the week on them that you think of for your grandma's pills. I'll take lipstick and just take the bullet of the lipstick out and smash it into a Monday and take a different one and smash it into a Tuesday. That way I have seven different lipsticks in a very, very small container to travel.On what else we'd find inside her travel carry-on bag...Probably the New York Times crossword puzzle. I don't use an iPhone, I use a Samsung Galaxy. I usually travel with my Fuji X100 camera because I like to take pictures, and I definitely have bobby pins and raw almonds at all times.On her favorite drugstore beauty product...I exercise a lot and I think you should take care of your skin afterwards, so I use a Neutrogena anti-acne body wash. Then I use the Restorsea body butter to put the moisture back in. On beauty tricks she's picked up on the set of ""Shameless""...I like to use eye creams to double as lip balm, cuticle cream and even eye makeup remover. I do that with my makeup artist on set, especially because there is not a lot of makeup on ""Shameless."" In terms of other tricks I've learned, I like to take the mascara wand and kind of really root it at the bottom of the lash line and zigzag back and forth at the base because it creates this darkness and thickness that almost mimics eyeliner. That gives your eyes sort of an extra pop without just focusing on elongating the tips of your eyelashes.On the unusual way she's learned to wash her face...I got really good advice from Patti Pao, who is the founder of Restorsea, and she told me that you have to splash your face 30 times while you're cleansing. And I often find that I don't splash enough. We just think that we're blessed to have clean water, but if you splash many times it will help to take that layer of dirt off.On her love for Pinterest...I am more into Pinterest than YouTube in terms of makeup and tutorials. I love The Beauty Department. I like to follow specific makeup artists that I love to get their tips. And I love to look on Pinterest because I don't work with a stylist. So I'll go on Style.com, pull all the dresses that I want and put them on a Pinterest page. And if I have an event coming up or a press junket, I'll just pull from there.On her worst hair memory...Earlier this summer, I was considering wearing a fake bang piece for a film that I did. So I took a hair extension and clipped it to the front of my head so that it would hang in front. I pulled the rest of my hair behind my ears, and I cut the hair extension straight across to see what bangs would look like on me. And I was like, ""Oh, this is interesting. Yeah, I don't think I'm going to do that."" When I unclipped the bang piece, I realized that I had actually chopped off a piece of my own hair. And I had that moment like that girl in the YouTube video when she realized she's burnt off her hair with the curling iron, where you look in the mirror and go, ""No! Wait, what?"" Welp. We'll always picture her as this:Want more HuffPost Style beauty content? Check us out on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram.
