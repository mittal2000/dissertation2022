With wonky cowlicks in the front? And not-so-flat parts in the back? Chances are you're not blowdrying your hair the right way. There are a few critical factors at play. As easy as it is to go in with hair dryers blazing, you could be over-drying your hair. Or perhaps you're using the wrong brush -- not to mention holding it incorrectly. During a recent visit to Sally Hershberger's downtown salon, we stopped stylist Teddi Cranford mid-blowout and got her best drying advice. What started out as a round of sincere questions, like ""Why does my hair look flat one minute, then frizzy and wavy an hour later?"" resulted in some pretty solid takeaway tips. Turns out we've been doing a few things wrong, and, perhaps, so have you. (It's okay, we love you anyway.) Here's what we learned: Brush type: ""The biggest mistake is using metal brushes,"" says Cranford. The metal varieties heat up way too fast, making hair way too hot. Look for a round brush with with a mix of nylon and boar bristles. Heat and air settings: With curly hair, it's better to not blast the hairline with high heat and a high air setting,"" notes Cranford. ""Use low heat and low air to brush the kinks out of your hairline. Otherwise, you can over-dry your hair making it harder to work with and, ultimately, get the shape and movement you want.""Holding the dryer in place: It would seem that pointing the dryer at your hair and, you know, just holding it there for a while would make it dry faster. Yeah, don't do that. ""Constantly be moving,"" says Cranford. ""You can't just set the blowdryer on the hair, [or] you're going to fry your hair off."" The angle you hold the dryer and brush: ""A good tip for at home is to make sure your brush is vertical and your blowdryer horizontal, as opposed to the other way around,"" says Cranford. ""This way you're going to get more of a modern wave, instead of blowing everything under. A lot of woman do that. They blow forward, you should be blowing back. It's the same with a curling iron, you want to keep it vertical and wrap hair horizontally -- you're going to create a better wave that way.""Sectioning off hair: Ok. You're probably thinking ""I already do this."" But you might not be doing it correctly -- especially if you're plagued with the dreaded, wonky-in-the-back business (which, we feel, is the worst). ""Section out a mohawk on top, then blow-dry the front and work your way to the back,"" says Cranford. Creating tension: One of the most important steps is drying taut sections of hair (but don't over-pull or yank). ""This is essential for getting hair to dry smoothly, especially if you have cowlicks,"" says Cranford. As far as how many times you pass over each section, Cranford says she'll go over the hair 10 times if she needs to. Though she stresses, ""I really making sure I'm getting the root and creating tension with the brush.""Also: check out six products that will make your blowout go a little more ... smoothly.

1,DIVORCE,Trying Online Dating After Divorce? Here Are 5 Ways To Improve Your Chances,"Angela Lutin, Contributor
Lifestyle Blogger at EssentiallyAngela.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trying-online-dating-afte_us_5b9cb43fe4b03a1dcc810a24,You never get a second chance to make a first impression. Your dating profile is your first virtual impression. Make it count.,2013-01-14,Closeup of business woman typing on laptop keyboard,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb43f240000500094c964.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the biggest steps after divorce is deciding to begin online dating. Usually after months of internal arguments about how it could be dangerous or perceived as desperate, there is that one pivitotal moment after going out to a bar and meeting no one yet again, or worse, sitting home alone on a Saturday night. An epiphany occurs. Could online dating be any worse that what I'm already doing?Almost three years after my divorce, I finally came to that conclusion. I write an advice column and every week, more and more of the questions that were asked pertained to online dating. One night, with a few glasses of wine fueling my curiosity, I decided to create a profile. There were the necessary pictures needed, but I wasn't prepared for the essay portion. This felt like a combination job interview/therapy session/pageant questionnaire. Once I got through the hard part -- you know, the stuff that actually made me think about things like what I really wanted in a person -- the fun began. Sitting in front of your computer screen filtering potential dates by any criteria imaginable is powerful. You certainly can't walk into a bar and eliminate all but those over six feet tall with a career in finance. Online you can.Don't be misled though. It's not as easy and magical as it seems. Ultimately, technology cannot replace chemistry and there are still a lot of frogs you'll end up emailing, texting, and meeting for coffee dates before you find the Prince or Princess of your dreams.When clients come to me for help after deciding to get back into the dating game post divorce, one of the first rules I establish is setting up an online dating profile. Many of them have tried online dating before but gave up, citing a lack of responses. The ones they do receive are never from anyone whom they really were interested in meeting. My rebuttal? Don't blame the messenger. The problem lies in the message you're sending. I review profiles both as a dating coach and as member of the online dating community. What I can tell you is this: You are doing it all wrong.  Just a few subtle changes can increase the responses, and subsequent dates, tenfold. Here are five that can be made today:1. Photos. You must have a photo. The photo should be of only you, and not with your ex-girlfriend, best friend, or children in the picture or cropped out. Have someone take an individual photo with a neutral background. Smile so you don't appear a possible serial killer. Provocative pictures bring unwanted attention and it makes you look easy. Absolutely under no circumstances should you use a mirror pic. (If you don't understand why then you need my coaching help asap.)2. ALL CAPS. Writing in all capital letters is universally acknowledged as screaming at someone. Why would you scream at someone you've never met? Turn the caps lock off and write sentences like a normal person. Which brings me to my next point...3. Misspelled Words. Don't say you're ""financially secure"" if you can't spell financially. I'm a horrible speller, but that's why I use spell check. Proof your profile for common grammatical mistakes like ""your"" for ""you're.""4. Incomplete Profiles.  I know you are awesome and a picture alone should send gobs of would be suitors into your inbox, but that's not how it works. Opening up about your passions and what you are searching for is a really vulnerable thing to do. That's why most profiles are limited, and therefore, don't get responses. Communication is one of the core pillars of a successful relationship. If you can't communicate who you are or what you want from the start, chances are you won't be able to later. Your profile will get passed over.5. List of Don'ts. I don't like garlic. Or water sports. Or romantic comedies if I'm being honest. But I don't list that in my profile. More than anything else on this list, the quickest way to have someone not take a chance on you is by leading with your ""don't, won't, and never happen"" list. Negativity is not an attractive quality. I understand it is a burden to filter through the profiles of those that don't meet your criteria, but leading with ""no'"" instead of ""yes"" is never the way to finalize a sale.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression. Your dating profile is your first virtual impression. Make it count."
2,DIVORCE,From Oprah to Chopra: Is All This Positive Thinking Really Making Us Feel Better?,"Alison L. Patton, Esq., Contributor
Family Law Attorney & Mediator, Writer, Speaker & Blogger at L...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/from-oprah-to-chopra-is-a_us_5b9cb42fe4b03a1dcc8108e4,"We've created a divorce culture equally obsessed with ""positive thinking"" and ""neat solutions.""  Whether it's well-meaning friends and family or the divorce blogs, the conversation is the same: ""Rah-rah"" motivational stories and self-help tools for making yourself happy again.",2013-01-14,Woman holding head and screaming against blue background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb42f2000004e00fdae03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I must start this post with a mea culpa. I admit it, I've written about positive thinking during divorce. I'm as guilty as every other self-help writer in America who has prescribed affirmations, happy thoughts and goal-setting. I'm ready for detox, however. I'm at the point where I can hardly stand to open a book or article with the title ""Happiness,"" ""Fulfillment,"" ""Success"" or ""Motivation,"" (along with some number of steps to attain it). I'm officially switching sides and joining forces with British journalist, Oliver Burkeman, who is the author of The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking.My husband gave me Burkeman's book for Christmas and it's a real eye-opener. Burkeman examines the positive-thinking/self-help movement that has swept through the United States and Great Britain over the past twenty years. He questions whether it has been effective. His conclusions? (Brace yourself:)1. The effort to try to feel happy is often precisely the thing that makes us miserable.Depressing? Actually, I found it comforting. It was like one of those moments in life when your best friend cuts through all the bullshit you've fed yourself about a particular issue, and although your friend's razor-sharp insight stings at first, it's a relief to finally hear the truth. There's something about the truth that we all recognize when we hear it. Our soul gives a quiet sigh of relief, knowing that our denial and rationalization are unraveling and we can start solving the problem because, finally, we can identify what the problem is. Burkeman's message isn't that optimism is a bad idea. ""Optimism is wonderful; goals can sometimes be useful; even positive thinking and positive visualization have their benefits. The problem is that we have developed the habit of chronically overvaluing positivity and the skills of 'doing' in how we think about happiness, and that we chronically undervalue negativity and the 'not-doing' skills, such as resting in uncertainty or getting friendly towards failure. To use an old cliché of therapy-speak, we spend too much of our lives seeking 'closure.' ... [Instead, we should be] embracing imperfection and easing up on the search for neat solutions."" This statement got me thinking about divorce in America. It seems to me that we've created a divorce culture equally obsessed with ""positive thinking"" and ""neat solutions."" We're desperately trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Whether it's well-meaning friends and family or the divorce blogs, the conversation is the same: ""Rah-rah"" motivational stories and self-help tools for making yourself happy again. There is certainly a time when such advice is useful, but I can't help wonder if this overriding ""divorce positivity"" is impeding the actual grief process and creating more anxiety and feelings of failure, the same way Burkeman has proven that all this goal-setting and happy talk are creating less happiness and less productivity.After all, a divorce culture focused on ""positive thinking"" creates a lot of pressure. You're told to get over it, forgive, let go, move on, get closure, think positively, look on the bright side, reinvent yourself, get motivated, start fresh, do things to boost your self-esteem, create lists of how to make your life over, do the same for your kids, focus on making more money, improve your career, meet a new mate and so on. That's quite a lot to think about while your heart is broken and your daily life is turned upside down.So what do we do about this? As Burkeman has shown, there's not much benefit to New Year's resolutions or another round of goal-setting. So I've decided, instead, that 2013 will be my year of compassion -- compassion for myself and all those around me, as we all contemplate life's undeniable uncertainties and throw out most of the self-help books.You're welcome to join me in what Burkeman would call the ""Stoic"" divorce movement and help us push the pendulum back. The perks are you get to feel whatever you're feeling, no matter how dark or depressed that may be. You can be as stuck as you want, and you're allowed to grieve hard and long. You're not required to do anything positive to pull yourself out of it until you feel ready. In fact, if you're feeling paralyzed, like someone just ran a truck over you and your life will never be the same again, that's perfectly acceptable. (That's actually a pretty normal feeling for people going through divorce. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.)The only rule is this: No playing out your negative emotions in your legal divorce case -- that would be a huge mistake. But other than that, you get a year-long hall pass from being positive and constructive.   And -- dare I even say it -- think on the bright side: if Burkeman is right about even just #8 above, then dwelling on your negative emotions in 2013 is the surest way to get beyond your grief."

While GDP might be the best indicator for measuring the health of a country's corporations, profits can be transferred offshore. We need a better measure for the standard of living within countries themselves. One look at the CIA World Factbook clears up this dilemma. The number that's tracked in all countries because, unlike GDP, it indicates the health of a country's people by taking into account factors such as pollution and poverty is the infant mortality rate. The U.S. has the highest percentage of infant deaths in the first world.The U.S. health disadvantage cuts across class and race boundaries and exists for all socioeconomic groups, including non-Hispanic whites, according to a brand-new report, ""U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health"" by a panel of experts in medicine, epidemiology, and demography and other fields in the social sciences.Even the U.S. elite under age 55 has higher rates of chronic disease, injuries and death, a most interesting factoid from this report comprising data from multiple studies conducted over decades. Assumptions that minorities and those with low incomes or low educational levels were the only ones at risk are unfounded. The report shows that even well-off Americans who do not smoke and are not overweight have inferior health on average than their counterparts in other wealthy countries. The U.S. Health report highlights the association between social spending and mortality in an analysis of 15 European countries. Each additional $100 per capita in social spending was associated with a 1.19 percent decrease in all-cause mortality, according to one study by Stuckler in 2010 cited in the U.S. Health report.""There is little question that the European welfare model is effective in redistributing income and reducing poverty,"" the U.S. Health report states. The panel observes that U.S. spending on social services (13.3 percent of GDP) was less than the OECD average (16.9 percent). Social spending is highly correlated with life expectancy, infant mortality, and potential years of life lost. Some of the countries with the biggest GDPs have the highest poverty rates: The U.S. topped the list, followed by Japan, according to 2012 OECD publication ""StatExtracts: Income Distribution -- Poverty,"" cited in the U.S. Health report.Who -- or what -- is growing? The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, six times that of China. The U.S. also has had among the highest rates of poverty and child poverty of all rich nations and many less affluent countries since the 1980s, according to the U.S. Health report. Homelessness in the first world is highest in the U.S. and U.K., two western countries with the highest and seventh-highest GDPs.Many European countries have policies that encourage walking as part of daily life. In 2008, the United States had the highest number of motor vehicles per person: 800 per 1,000, compared with 526 in the United Kingdom, 521 in Sweden, 598 in France, and 554 in Germany, according to a 2012 World Bank study.The U.S. had the highest firearm ownership, with the number of firearms per 100 people at 88.8 percent. The closest runner-up was Switzerland with 45.7 percent. The report said among 23 OECD countries, 80 percent of all firearm deaths occurred in the United States. United States firearm homicide rates were 20 times higher (43 times higher for those ages 15-24) than in 22 high-income OECD countries. Advocates of ""personal responsibility"" often note that people should be free to choose to engage in unhealthy behaviors and bear the consequences, according to the U.S. Health report. But such choices may not always be made ""freely"": They are made in a societal and environmental context (Brownell et al., 2010). Parents may want to serve healthy meals but may not be able to do so without nearby retailers that sell fresh produce (Larson et al., 2009). They may want their children to play outside but the neighborhood may be unsafe ... Americans do not make product choices in a vacuum, and they face both environmental supports and barriers to healthy behaviors. Advertising and marketing of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods; sexualized content in television, film, and musical entertainment; and exposure to violence and stress have known consequences to health ... The education system of the United States ranks 26th on how well its education system meets the needs of a competitive economy.Although it is arguable whether a ""competitive economy"" has needs, the report suggests that the U.S. education system also is not meeting the needs of the country's people. Number OneNowhere is the U.S. number one. Not even on social mobility, which is low in the U.S. relative to other high-income countries.""Men born into the poorest fifth of families in the United States in 1958 had a higher likelihood of ending up in the bottom fifth of the earnings distribution than did males similarly positioned in five Northern European countries -- 42 percent in the United States, compared to 25 to 30 percent in the other countries,"" the U.S. Health report says.U.S. 15-year-olds ranked third-lowest in mathematics and seventh-lowest in reading (just above the OECD average) and science (just below the OECD average), according to the panel's examination of the 2003 PISA data for the 17 peer countries.Would we fall off the edge of the earth if we produced only enough to live healthy, peaceful lives? After the startling results brought to light in the U.S. Health report, many are questioning whether it is better to strive for high corporate growth at the expense of life expectancy.For more by J.

And then we are asked how to identify such people and prevent these violent acts.Anyone who commits such horrific crimes is deranged in some way. What is little understood are the different kinds of disordered thinking and the different paths that lead to them. Although the perpetrators and circumstances of each tragedy are individual there are common features which separate them into distinct categories. Those who suffer from a psychotic mental disorder are truly disconnected from reality and reach a point where they believe their delusions unquestioningly or experience hallucinations directing their behavior. These individuals -- who might include Jared Loughner in Arizona, and the Virginia Tech killer, Seung-Hui Cho -- are compelled by their psychotic symptoms to go out and kill. A second group is defined by those who commit violence due to an irrational commitment to religious or political ideological beliefs, who might be the army psychiatrist, Nidal Malik Hasan at Fort Hood, the mass murderer of the Norwegian Workers' Youth League, Anders Breivik or Timothy McVeigh of the Oklahoma City bombing.A third group of killers are those who lack control over their emotions and impulses, and commit crimes of passion or acts of hot-blooded revenge. These are people with a history of impulsive behavior as well as those who, in the heat of the moment or due to a unique set of circumstances, experience emotions that exceed their capacity for control. All these are different from the fourth kind of killer, one who has an antisocial personality disorder, the socially disaffected loner with no conscience, moral constraints or consideration of what is right and wrong, as perhaps were the Olympic Park Bomber, Eric Rudolph, and the Beltway Sniper, John Allen Muhammad.How do you distinguish among them? The way these cases end offers one clue. It's significant that the most obviously psychotic rarely kill themselves at the end of their shooting sprees. They don't know they have done anything wrong. Others, like Adam Lanza, in the recent Connecticut case, appear cognizant enough to understand that their lives are over once they are caught, and so do end their own lives.These may seem like subtle distinctions. But in behavioral disorders, it is often subtle differences that allow us to accurately determine if destructive behavior is due to mental illness and, if so, diagnose and treat patients as early as possible in the course of their illnesses. We cannot predict exactly when or where mental illness will result in violence. However, we can identify risk factors to discern who has a greater potential for destructive behavior. While psychotic symptoms, volatile emotions and impulsive behavior increase the potential for violence, the majority of floridly psychotic or deeply enraged people don't hurt others, and both conditions respond well to treatment with medication and specific forms of therapy. Identifying mentally ill people and providing accessible treatment is key to reducing violence.The world would no doubt be safer if fewer people had easy access to automatic weapons. Registries of persons with criminal and mental illness histories have been proposed but are costly, questionably effective and, for mentally ill persons, discriminatory. What is abundantly clear is that our first line of defense against what just happened in Connecticut, and not that long ago in Colorado, Arizona and West Virginia, is a mental health care system that is pro-active, widely available and fully accessible.The lowest-hanging fruit to prevent these mass shootings is the adoption of final rules for a bill that was passed and signed into law almost five years ago: the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act. The actual implementation of this law, combined with the anticipated effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, would dramatically improve access to mental health care across the country, and in so doing lower the stigma that often prevents people who need help from seeking it, or sticking with treatment. More and more, the system isn't failing to identify these patients, but rather failing to treat them. Jared Loughner, Seung-Hui Cho and James Holmes were young men who never completed, or in some cases received, treatment during or just after college -- many of these illnesses strike hardest in the late teens and early 20s -- and such transitions are often when patients are lost to the medical system. While there is still much to learn about the shooter in Connecticut, he appears to have engaged with care for a psychiatric or developmental disorder at some point, and then withdrew from it and from the world.In the searing aftermath of these shootings comes the opportunity to take bold action. The debate over gun control may never end. But the debate over mental health parity and equal access to care ended some time ago. Let's put parity into effect now to improve the nation's mental health services and help to prevent further tragedies.Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D. is Professor and Chair of Psychiatry at Columbia University and the President Elect of the American Psychiatric AssociationFor more by Jeffrey A.

And this one offers up more bad new for soda. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, suggests that drinking soda -- including diet soda -- is associated with an increased risk with depression. For the good news, drinking coffee was tied to a lower risk. The study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 65th Annual Meeting in March. (This is the same time Mayor Bloomberg's ban on selling sodas larger than 16 ounces is set to take effect in delis, fast-food restaurants, and other eating establishments in New York City.)  This was a large study involving over 250,000 people ages 50-71. Subjects who drank more than four cans or cups per day of soda were up to 30 percent more likely to develop depression than those who did not drink soda. And the risk appeared to be greater for people who drank diet soda. If you love coffee, here is some good news: People who drank four cups of coffee daily were nearly 10 percent less likely to develop depression than those who did not drink coffee.So, what do we make of this study?The study doesn't show that soda causes depression, but rather found an association between the two -- soda drinkers were more likely to be diagnosed with depression. It is important not to confuse the two.Here is what I told the New York Daily News when called to comment on the study:It's hard to tell from this single study what the exact connection between sweetened drinks and mood might be -- but either way, you're better off cutting back, says Lisa Young, Ph.D, R.D., an NYC-based nutritionist and adjunct professor in the department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at NYU.As you may know, I am not a fan of soda -- both regular and diet soda -- and I think it is worth limiting for reasons other than depression. Regular soda provides unnecessary calories and sugar, while diet soda contains unnecessary chemicals. A 16-ounce soda contains far too many liquid calories -- nearly 200 empty calories, all of which come from sugar. This is one of the reasons I am an avid supporter of Mayor Bloomberg's ban on sugar-sweetened beverages, as I wrote for the New York Daily News and for HuffPost.So, what should one drink, I am often asked by clients and friends.I'd suggest water, flavored seltzers, and herbal teas. And, if you love coffee, I guess you can get some encouragement from this study.

My plans meticulously laid out.On Sept. 8, 2002, I would ride my first ""century"" -- an endurance bike ride of 100 miles. I had always been a ""high achiever"" (let's not be judgy and call me an ""over achiever,"" all right?), so I had no doubt that I could train and complete the ride. Back in the mid-1990s, I had completed three NYC Marathons, and I logged my 50-mile training weeks while billing 2,000+ hours as a NYC attorney and planning my black-tie wedding, which included an entirely unironic performance by me of Vanessa Williams' ""Save The Best For Last."" (I was a starry-eyed 28, and I don't think irony had been invented yet, or so I shall believe if I so choose.) Immediately after the 1996 marathon, I decided it was time to start having babies. When I didn't become pregnant on the first try, I booked an appointment with the best fertility specialist on the Upper East Side. Onlookers scoffed at my attempt to control the uncontrollable. But my persistence paid off: An out-patient surgery reversed an underlying structural condition preventing implantation, and just 23 days later, I had ""passed"" my pregnancy test (I'd like to think that I got an A, but this test was pass/fail).Brian was born in 1997, perfect, as expected. Adam came along in 1999, also perfect, also as expected. Within three months of each pregnancy, I was back in my skinny jeans. At first I relied on running, but over time I incorporated inline skating and figure skating. Eventually, I discovered long distance biking, because it seemed to allow me to do everything I wanted, and all at the same time: I could do my my training sitting down! I could review contracts while on a stationary bike! I could strap Adam into the little back seat of my bike and squeeze in some quality mommy-time while training!For six weeks during the summer of 2002, my burgeoning family rented a vacation house a mile from the beach in Westport, Conn. Those were truly the salad days, or so it seemed. I had managed to score one of the first ever ""limited-hours"" gigs at a large NYC law firm. I grilled up gourmet meals for visiting friends, I transitioned from Cosmopolitans to Mojitos to showcase the wonderful mint I was growing in the garden, I applied self-tanner to my milky white skin so that I would look good in my bikinis, and I spent hours and hours on my bike, training for my first century.I was tired that summer, which shouldn't be surprising when you consider all that I was doing. But looking back, I realize that I was more tired than I should have been. And when I see photos, I can see that I looked like hell. On the morning of Aug. 2, 2002, I found the lump. It was in my right breast, and I knew immediatetly that there was nothing benign about it. It didn't have any particular shape, it didn't hurt, and it didn't move. I found it in the shower, and I came out dripping, breathless. Six weeks later, I had both of my breasts removed, taking a leave of absence from my law firm to recover. Six months of chemotherapy followed, during which I did not go back to work. With chemo came total hair loss, irreversible infertility (e.g., chemo-induced menopause), exhaustion, depression, a transfusion, a week-long stint in the isolation tank at the hospital, and a total failure to continue to be the kind of uber-mommy that recites six bedtime stories back to back, makes homemade banana pancakes for breakfast and takes the kids to the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum on rainy days when the playground's not an option.After that, there was a six-week course of radiation, surgery to remove my ovaries, three attempts at reconstruction (the last one was the charm), a year of an anti-cancer drug called Herceptin, an annual infusion of a bone-building drug called Zometa, and a daily anti-cancer pill called Arimidex that I have been taking ""for five years"" for the past 10 years.I consider myself lucky. I'm alive. When all was said and done, I got the chance to be thin and have long hair again, and most importantly, to be the kind of mom I wanted to be, again.But I never did bike that century. And I never went back to being a lawyer. Today, I mother my teenage boys, I write, I speak, and I do my best to inspire people to think, or just to inspire people in general.Although I would never say that I am ""grateful"" for having had breast cancer, I am pleased with the change in course that breast cancer catalyzed for me. Apparently, life is what happens while we're busy making other plans. And while I was busy making new plans (to write and produce a short film, to transcribe a friend's experience growing up in Mao's China, to write the BDSM-themed novel that ""50 Shades of Grey"" could have been had it been infused with gritty realism), my ""10 Years After Breast Cancer"" came to the attention of HERS Breast Cancer Foundation (HBCF) through their PR Agency, Gutenberg PR, and I was, in turn, introduced to Neil Walsky, 25, and Jesse Frechione, 23, two guys from Anchorage, Alaska, who had meticulously planned a 7,000-mile bike ride from Anchorage to Cartegena, Colombia. Their noble goal was to honor Neil's mom, Agnes Walsky, who was successfully treated for breast cancer in 2011, and also to raise awareness and funds for HBCF. I wrote about Neil and Jesse's plans in the first Bicycle Diaries installment. After Neil and Jesse made it through Alaska, the Yukon Territory and down the Pacific Northwest Coast into San Francisco, I updated the story in ""The Bicycle Diaries Part 2."" The next leg of their ride took them all the way down the California coast The riding was relatively easy, and the accomodations -- with friends and family -- relatively comfortable. In late October, they crossed into Baja, and the course changed. Tijuana was chaotic: terrible traffic, confusing roads, difficulty communicating (neither Neil nor Jesse is fluent in Spanish). Further south, in a town called ""Warm Showers,"" they met a man who told them stories about his grandfather -- a drug dealer -- who used his machine gun to intimidate the neigborhood kids. While riding aong a dirt road in Uruapan, a truck stopped and asked them if they wanted to help them press wine. And so they did. But with the exception of a raucus night of street soccer with some local youths, the roads heading south through Santa Maria, Catavina and Santa Rosalia were lonely... almost ghostly. When they reached La Paz, the monotony was overwhelming, and Neil and Jesse began feeling disconnected from their original purpose. They spent days by the water, soul searching, contemplating what lay ahead on their journey. That's when Neil and Jesse learned their own lesson about what happens when the road changes unexpectedly (as it always does). Jesse confided to Neil that he was losing sight of what they had set out to do. South America seemed to be getting farther and farther away. And while their ""honorary moms"" at HBCF were never far from their hearts, they were very far from Baja. Jesse he had been offered a position on the crew of The Baha Bash, a 37-foot sailboat heading to San Diego. After more soul-searching, Jesse broke the news to Neil that he was heading back north with the Bash. Waking up the morning after Jesse left, Neil resigned himself to continuing along the plotted course, even if it meant riding without a wingman through unfamiliar countries where he did not know the language. However, a phone call with his older brother, Eric Walsky, opened his eyes to yet another possibility: Having lost his cycling partner, he had nevertheless gained freedom in terms of time and destination. The unexpected was unexpectedly filled with possibility. Ultimately, Neil decided to spend a few days relaxing into the idea of his newly-modified journey before flying back to San Diego, from which he would bike east across the United States, all the way to St. Augustine, Florida. During this time, Neil realized that now that he was cycling across the U.S., he might not have to do so alone, after all. On Dec. 8, Neil's father, Buck Walsky, met Neil in Phoenix, Ariz., bought a bike and joined the journey.Neil adapted to the unexpected... by allowing himself the freedom to change course. But every good lesson bears repeating, right?Eight days into the ride from Phoenix to St. Augustine (via a route established by the American Cycling Association), Neil's knees were hurting. It was in El Paso, Texas, that Neil realized that no amount of ibuprofin was giving him relief. Buck urged Neil to call his doctor, who advised Neil that it was time to find another mode of transportation. It was a difficult decision for Neil to make. He had already come so far. He had already adapted to unexpected events. He had already changed course. And the ride with Buck had been a truly serendipitous opportunity for father-son bonding. But it would have been foolish, medically speaking, for Neil to continue the ride. And bravely, Neil accepted this reality, made the decision to fly home with his father and phoned Karen Jackson at HBCF to break the news. Karen was supportive, of course, thrilled as she was that he had gone as far as he did. On Christmas Eve, Neil and Buck returned home. Neil's knees are recovering, he is back to playing hockey (former pro player that he was), and he's working on a book about his journey. Jesse completed his sail and returned home to Alaska on Dec. 30, safe and sound. Mike Price, who joined Neil and Jesse in the Pacific Northwest through Northern California, has been back home in Alaska since October.While I was recovering from my cancer treatment, I studied the works of Pema Chödrön, a modern Buddhist who wrote such books as When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times. Her comments on the topic of ""changing course"" continue to inspire me. ""To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest,"" she wrote. ""To live fully is to be always in no-man's-land, to experience each moment as completely new and fresh.""Neil and Jesse, and the friends and family who accompanied them all, got to experience something of what Pema Chödrön meant. We don't have to enjoy the unexpected obstacles, the forks in the road, the changes of plan, exactly. But we can choose to awaken to them, to view them as opportunities to accept and adapt and to form new and possibly better plans.Epilogue: All of the ""players"" will be meeting in San Francisco for the HBCF HERS People With Purpose Awards Luncheon, which takes place on April 25, 2013. I will be giving the keynote address, Neil will be speaking as well, and Agnes will be a guest. I look forward to meeting Neil, Agnes and Karen in person, along with everyone else who has made all of this possible.Sponsorship opportunities  are still available, and donations are still welcome and greatly appreciated.

7,PARENTING,Raising Gracious Children: 3 Ways to Help Kids Say Thanks,"Emma Jenner, Contributor

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb67d2200003000d958b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The holidays are over now, and all of us are thinking ahead to our goals and ambitions for the new year. Nevertheless, if you're a parent, I urge you and your children to take one last look at the 2012 holiday season together. This is a perfect time to help your kids discover the joy of gratitude.Below are three ways you can show young people that it's fun to say ""thank you"" for the gifts and blessings they receive at Christmas time. (It is also, of course, the right thing to do.) With any luck, your children will be exchanging gifts with family and friends for the rest of their lives, and these habits will help them grow into gracious young adults.In Person With parties and presents still fresh in everyone's minds, it's a great time to reminisce about family gatherings. Ask your child to tell you stories about the holidays, reenacting the look on Granny's face when she opened a gift -- the sillier and more exaggerated, the better! For 3- and 4-year olds, this is a great way to review feelings vocabulary and explore facial expressions associated with emotions. For slightly older children, this can lead to a simple conversation about being aware of others' feelings. Ask your children questions: How did Granny look? How did the person who gave her the gift look? How did they, the children, feel seeing their loved ones so happy? And what will they do to help create that happiness the next time they participate in a gift exchange? Play a party game in which children pretend it's their birthday and open imaginary gifts. Help them to practice pausing after opening each gift, looking the gift-giver in the eye and thanking him or her. You can also try playing at a tea party, where the ""guest"" gives the ""host"" a cake. What should the ""host"" say? How does it feel to get such a lovely cake? Demonstrate gratitude for good company, as well as gifts: the ""guest"" can say thanks for the party invitation, and the ""host"" can say thanks for coming. Switch roles so your child can watch you model proper behavior and try it herself.As you giggle and play games with your child, make sure to emphasize that gratitude is about more than enjoying the presents or party -- it's also about being grateful for the people around us. On the Phone Sometimes it's impossible for all our friends and family to gather for a celebration. If your children can't say thanks in person, encourage them to pick up the phone. Some children get a bit shy about ringing people they don't speak to frequently, but you can help with this by rehearsing ahead of time with a game. Take turns pretending to be the caller. Be excited in both roles and emphasize how happy you are when he calls you about his gift. With a bit of help, any child who can articulate ""thank you"" can say it into the phone. A 2- or 3-year-old should be able to say a simple ""thank you for my puzzle."" Coach 4- and 5-year olds to talk about using or planning to use the gift (""Hello, Aunt Marge, this is Jack. Thank you for the dinosaur puzzle. I began it today all by myself. I think it's a stegosaurus...""), and when you role-play, exaggerate how good it feels to Aunt Marge to hear those details. By age 6 or 7, children won't need prompting during the call, but acting it out ahead of time is still great practice. Play-acting helps children to develop empathy and be mindful of others' feelings, and after role-playing the calls a few times, picking up a real phone should be less intimidating.You can make the process of calling and writing easier by keeping track of gifts as they are opened. For children old enough to write unaided, it's best to have them take responsibility for keeping the list, but you can help by having a pencil and paper at the ready. Tracking what gifts they receive and from whom is another way to cultivate gratitude by building awareness of the connection between person and present.Thank-You Notes Even some grown-ups wince and slowly back away when they hear ""thank-you notes."" While thank-you notes were non-negotiable when I was growing up, I admit to grumbling at my mum's insistence on them as a follow-up to telephone or in-person thanks. But thank-you notes needn't feel like a chore, and with a bit of advance planning, you can get children excited by making the notes a fun activity. Assemble a box ahead of time filled with colorful paper, tape, glue sticks, markers and a new sheet of stickers. Label it the ""Gratitude Box,"" and explain that this is a special box for showing thanks. Any child old enough to hold a crayon can participate, and siblings can easily work side by side. Children as young as 3 can decorate a card that mum or dad writes out, while a 4-year-old might dictate a sentence or two and should be able to add her name at the bottom. Starting at 5 or 6, she can be expected to write out a short note with a bit of coaching. For an older child, picking out his own stationery can be part of the fun. Have an adventure choosing something from a special shop, or use a free website or program to customize official-looking letterhead to print off and handwrite notes on. At this time of year, you likely have your own thank-you notes to write. Doing them at the same time is a terrific way to cross them off your to-do list, set a good example to your children, and spend time together as a family.One fun craft idea I've used for thank-you notes is to take a picture of your child with the gift, and let her cut and paste it onto the note. You can take photos as the presents are opened and develop them later, or take them just before writing the notes and print them at home. Either way, most children adore projects with cutting and pasting, and it helps to personalize the letters.As for the content of the note, specificity is key: ""Dear Henry, I love the Millennium Falcon Legos. Star Wars is my favorite movie!"" is miles better than ""Dear Henry, Thank you for the present."" Even if the gift wasn't a favorite, the note can acknowledge the giver's intentions and say something sincere and specific, like ""Dear Nana, Thank you for the scarf. It must have taken a long time to make. It is warm."" Avoid the temptation to lie or exaggerate; however well-intentioned, parent-approved fibbing sends the wrong message, and it simply isn't necessary.Not only do these games and activities teach good manners, they also foster empathy and help children internalize the appreciation they express. As a nanny, I've noticed a distinct increase in the sense of entitlement among young children, and that's a difficult pattern to break. In my experience, it's far easier to start teaching appreciation and awareness of others' feelings early on than it is to work backwards when you find yourself with a Veruca Salt on your hands. While it's natural for parents to want to give their children everything, make sure that along with toys and praise, you give your children the regular reinforcement that makes thankfulness a part of who they are, not just something they do.In A Short History of England, G.K. Chesterton says that ""thanks are the highest form of thought; and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder."" With games, crafts and quality time together, you can help your child reap the benefits of an attitude of gratitude."
