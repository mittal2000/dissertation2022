And yet, although the films are not romances, there are more realistic representations of romantic love threaded through the three movies than you'll find in a multiplex full of romantic comedies.Here are some examples of love -- and loss -- in the Toy Story trilogy:Fidelity Counts: When Toy Story ends, Woody is in a relationship with Bo Peep. When Toy Story 2 starts, he's still in the same relationship. That's not the way it happens in a typical sequel. Usually, the guy gets the girl at the end of the movie and they live happily ever after... until the next movie where he starts the process all over again with a new girl. The love the hero has for any of the women he's paired off with is trivialized when the producers care more about the ""story arc"" of him pursuing and winning her than they do about him being with her.People Are Not Prizes to Be Won: In Toy Story 2, Woody meets another western-themed toy. A girl toy. And yet, he doesn't ever look at her as a romantic rival to Bo Peep. And Jessie doesn't look at him that way, either. Movies instinctively want to pair people up. People are presented as being incomplete unless they find love at the end of the story even if their character's quest has nothing to do with finding love. When a romance is tacked onto the end of the movie, it always feels to me like it cheapens love. (""Good job defeating the alien invasion force, Lieutenant. Here's a medal of honor and a pretty girl to kiss."") Despite what you learned in When Harry Met Sally, men and women can be friends.Girls Can Ogle Too: Okay, yes... in the coda to Toy Story 2 Jessie does go after Buzz. But it doesn't bother me here for three reasons. First, it's a good matching of personalities. Second, Buzz isn't treated as a prize. He's a fully drawn character who by that point has already starred in two movies. Typically, the person being grabbed up was written for the sole purpose of giving the other character a romantic interest. Here both parties are fully realized characters. Finally, this time around, it's the girl who's in charge. And she doesn't futz around neurotically. She sees Buzz, she knows what she wants, and she knows she's got him wrapped around her finger. That's not the way it happens in movies (particularly in ones where the romance is tacked on at the end.)There's A Difference Between Infatuation and Love: In Toy Story 3, it's love at first sight when Ken and Barbie meet. They were, after all, made for each other. But that's not true love. It's infatuation. Or, if it's love, it's young love. It's not built on anything solid. But watch what happens toward the end of the movie. They've come to know each other better. They know that the other person isn't always nice. They know that the other person doesn't always talk in sickly-sweet tones. Ken learns that his love is sincere. He doesn't want some other Barbie... he wants THIS Barbie. And he earns Barbie's respect. That's a stronger foundation than they had when they started. They've got something more to go on other than their inherent need to love somebody.Sometimes Loves Just Works: Mr. Potato Head and Mrs. Potato Head are both sort of cranky with each other, and yet their relationship works that way. They may have a caustic tone, but the love is still real. We all know real people like that.Love Isn't Obligatory: Some of the characters make it through the trilogy without ever finding a love interest. The implication of most movies that true love is inevitable tends to diminishes the fact that love is special. It's something that you're lucky to find. It's not a guarantee. Yes, it's sad that the Hamms and Slinky Dogs of the world have no partners, but it's refreshing that the movies don't pity them. The characters seem to be happy on their own.But perhaps that's just because they don't know what they're missing. Speaking of which...Sometimes The People You Love Are Taken Away: As a widower, this is the part of the series that really strikes me. There's so much happening in Toy Story 3 that you may forget that Woody tells us that Bo Peep is... gone. But even though Woody doesn't speak of it again, you can tell from his face that he won't ever forget what happened.Bo Peep was never a fully developed character in the trilogy, so you probably don't feel any sense of loss. But she was real to Woody in the life they had off screen.There are plenty of romantic comedies that start by introducing you to a widower. (Cute kids are optional.) These rom-coms are never really about exploring grief--they're just using it as a manipulative plot device. They're telling the viewer that the man is already worthy of love. (All he needs is the right woman to teach him that he can love again!) It's a shameful use of cinematic shorthand.Toy Story 3 doesn't do that. Bo Peep was probably taken away many years ago, but Woody isn't looking for a replacement. The filmmakers aren't giving him one, either. There are female toys in his world, but there's nothing to suggest that Dolly will ever be anything other than a new friend. Pixar respects their characters too much to make them go through obligatory plot points. Other filmmakers would say that a love interest for the hero would make the ending happier. Pixar isn't other filmmakers.Love Stays With You Through Thick and Thin: I have a pet peeve about the standard Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl plot line. The Boy Loses Girl part always feels so forced. Either he makes an implausible mistake, or else there's an implausible misunderstanding. What's wrong with just letting boy and girl get each other and then having them go off to face the world together as a team? That's the way real love goes.And that's the way it works in Toy Story 3. The Jessie/Buzz relationship has a roadblock when Buzz gets reprogrammed in the middle of the movie. But it's not a misunderstanding. At the end of the movie, he doesn't have to explain to her that it wasn't his fault. Jessie knows what's going on the whole time. She can't be romantic with the demo-mode version of Buzz, but she doesn't turn her back on him, either. She fights with her friends to get the real Buzz back.People don't get reprogrammed like toys. But they do go through hardships. They do get sick--sometimes to the point of losing their old personality and identity. In the face of all of that, real love doesn't leave."

3,TRAVEL,Impressions of India: Road to Ranthambhore,"Mary Anne Erickson, ContributorArtist, Photographer, Blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/impressions-of-india-road_b_7079084.html,,2015-04-17,2015-04-16-1429195461-2602434-overstuffedtruckmontage.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-16-1429195461-2602434-overstuffedtruckmontage-thumb.jpg,"Saturday January 17, 2015The Call to Prayer has been an amazing way to awaken in the morning darkness. This enchanting sound has greeted me each day and beckoned me into a new set of adventures in a foreign land. Today was primarily a road travel day with our delightful and daring driver Mr. Singh, his young sidekick Neetu, and our now beloved guide Adil. We've been rotating positions on the bus and it's fascinating how different the experience is sitting in the front window vs. the back of the bus. Leonard and I usually vie for the front seat, as we're both photographers and you can see more of the action up ahead. There are drawbacks, however, the main one being the reflection of the dashboard which prevents capturing a clear shot. And also if we're going fast, things come at you too quickly which requires an equally instant response. We've each tried different strategies to make this work, Leonard's favorite is to zoom in on something far away - but I find it too hard to focus. Sitting on the side of the bus only offers side views, which often go by much too quickly. We've both taken to just holding the camera up and snapping away never knowing for sure what we'll catch. It's an adventure after all!Most of the landscape today was flat with little definition, bad air pollution, and what I'm calling a ""post-apocalyptic"" landscape: what appear to be burned out buildings (but they may also just be partially built buildings of cement that have been given up on); falling down buildings; piles of rubble and trash everywhere; bulls, pigs, and dogs (the one generic dog) rummaging through the garbage looking for food; small villages with groups of men sitting around drinking coffee; and colorfully dressed women in saris and bangles doing all kinds of heavy work!! Adil explained to us that this is completely normal in rural village life: the women are expected to get up early, make breakfast and get the kids dressed (and off to school if they're lucky). Then the man wakes up around 10:00, asks for his tea and expects breakfast. He may go off to town to hang out with his friends while the wife goes out to work in the fields or a job laboring at something. He comes back for lunch and expects her to be there to serve him, then the same pattern is repeated in the afternoon. She then is expected to make dinner and take care of the children. The pattern continues day after day. My goodness! What a life for these rural village women! This is why Poonam Kathuria's SWATI mission is so important to support: she is really offering these women a chance to break out of this cycle and create meaningful lives for themselves AND their families.As we got closer to our destination, Ranthambhore, the landscape turned lush and green and we began to see mile upon mile of fields of canola (bright yellow flowers) and wheat (vibrant green). The harvest will be in February and March, before the heat of summer and the monsoon season kick in. What a pleasure to see this colorful landscape and know that these folks are more prosperous. I've been fascinated by a few phenomena on the roads here aside from the highly decorated trucks: what appear to be really over-burdened loads on trucks. I can't believe they allow this! It looks so unsafe!And then there are the cars and buses that are overflowing with people! We've seen numerous jeeps with guys hanging off the back and in this particular case we counted 22 people in total on and in this jeep! Also I've observed many buses with lots of people sitting on top of the bus! How do they stay on when it's cruising on the highway at high speeds?We pulled off the small road onto an even smaller and extremely bumpy dirt road as we approached a white mecca that was to be our hotel for the next two days called Nahargarh Ranthambhore. This could have been Shangri La for all we knew. We passed this man hitched to a highly decorated camel on our way in, an exotic touch to this foreign landscape. As we passed through the entry gate we were met with what may have well been our own Maharaja's palace! And this is a newly-built hotel with only 84 rooms. We were once again wowed and in love. Dinner at the restaurant was the finest Indian buffet yet, and we were thrilled to not have to make any decisions about what to order. The spread included: Chicken hariyali tikka, Chicken kadai, Vegetable kebab, French spinach (delicious spinach puree), Okra masala, Vegetable jhalfreizi, Squash balls, Lentils (dahl, Green pea pulao, garlic and plain naan (we've come to love this!), and for dessert a homemade vanilla ice cream with banana toffee sauce. I would love to stay here for a week at least, just for the food!To bed early tonight, as we're getting up very early for our tiger safari in the morning. Patricia wore her leopard outfit to dinner as a good luck omen that we would have a sighting! As we're winding down our last week in India, thank you again for following along on this grand adventure.Mary Anne Erickson is an artist who has been documenting the demise of the American roadside culture for over 30 years in paintings and photography.

(Hope is the onetime Baptist minister's hometown.) Huckabee, who recently left his Fox News talk show to explore a presidential campaign, also ran for the Republican nomination in 2008. He won the Iowa caucuses, but dropped out of the race in March as eventual nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) took a clear lead in the primaries. Several Republicans have already joined what is shaping up to be a crowded GOP primary field, including Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.). Other prominent Republicans eyeing the nomination include former Fla. Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. ""Most of the people who were with me eight years ago are still with me,"" Huckabee said earlier Friday. ""But I do know that yes, there will be competition."""
5,WOMEN,The Specialness Epidemic -- What Our Need to Stand Out is Really All About,"Michelle Bersell, ContributorMichelle Bersell, M.A., M.Ed., is known as a visionary leader ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-specialness-epidemic----what-our-need-to-stand-out-is-really-all-about_b_7082968.html,"We are all unique and have different gifts to share, but ""specialness"" is not just bestowed upon only a chosen few.",2015-04-17,face of young beautiful healthy woman and reflection in the mirror,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6031f260000350082dff6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It happened to me at one of the most inopportune times. That need to feel special, unique, be selected, feel seen; that feeling happened while I was being blessed by a monk. On a recent holiday to Thailand, my husband and I were visiting The Big Buddha in Phuket. A glorious site with love emanating from every corner. Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw a monk giving blessings. Drawn like a magnet, I took off my shoes and ""walked"" up on my knees toward the monk. Before me was a mother and her young daughter, then a group of three teenage Thai girls. Everything felt beautiful and holy, as the monk prayed for those before him and sprinkled holy water on their heads. Then suddenly, something different happened. Since I didn't speak Thai, I wasn't sure what was said, but what I SAW was that one of the Thai girls was ""selected"" to receive a unique gift. While most were getting bracelets made by the monks themselves (think friendship braided bracelets), she received a beautiful necklace, which he further blessed and prayed upon before giving it to her.Next, I was up, and truth be told, I wanted one of those necklaces too. Yes, there before the monk, I was jealous. Thankfully, I quickly got over it so I could appreciate the experience. Tears trickled down my face to have experienced the blessing and I left.But I had to think, What was this jealousy about? Then it quickly occurred to me: Oh yes, that need to be special. Quite frankly, I think we have a specialness epidemic on our hands. We so desperately want to be seen and to do that we feel we need to stand apart from others. We can see it with young kids yearning to earn a trophy, healers believing they have been specially ""selected"" for their spiritual gifts or even our constant addiction to selfies.Of course, we are all unique and have different gifts to share, but ""specialness"" is not just bestowed upon only a chosen few. Each of us has talents and gifts. It is just that some of us are utilizing them and some of us get tripped up in ""not enoughness"" to utilize our gifts. In order to try to help that ""not good enough"" feeling, our egos try to make us enough by being considered ""special.""Yes, that most common of shame themes of not being ""good enough"" is what is behind our specialness epidemic. And there I was experiencing it. After receiving the emotional surge of jealousy, I had two options.1. Shame myself. My ego would want to go with something like ""What's wrong with you? You having this jealousy demonstrates your not spiritual enough to receive that necklace. You don't deserve it!""2. Understand the empowered message to jealousy/envy, which is: you can have it too. Obviously, I can't have the necklace, but I can give myself the meaning underneath the necklace. Which then I quickly reminded my little girl (inner child) ""You are beautiful and enough just as you are.""Will our shame continue to rear it's head in obscure ways? Um, YES! And, that's OK because you know that our negative emotions are the gateway to recognizing when shame is triggered AND you know that our emotions teach us how to provide for ourselves internally what we need.What this means is that while unconscious shame will trigger you from time to time, you have a path to change the outcome of BELIEVING IN THE SHAME.It is our belief in our shame that limits us from having a fulfilled life. In order to take away our belief in shame we need to have PERSISTENCE. This means that every time a negative feeling appears, we need to understand both the disempowered and empowering messages. Then we have CHOICE: The choice to choose which message to believe. Each time a negative feeling appears, you have a choice. Choice 1, sweep it under the rug. Choice 2, understand the deeper meaning.Although Choice 1 seems easier, in the long run it isn't! Not knowing how to provide for your internal needs means your emotions go SIDEWAYS and ultimately you'll feel like your needs aren't fully being met.GO THE DISTANCE for yourself by going into what you truly feel. You are worth it and when you demonstrate your self-value, guess what? Your self-value is reflected back to you! When we aren't willing, the lack of self-value gets mirrored back to us as we struggle with finances, relationships or reaching our potential.YOU are MORE THAN WORTH the time and persistence to make your life feel fulfilling to you! Just let your emotions support you -- OK?

Duncan participated in an event to discuss '50 Years of Struggle: Youth Driving Economics, Education, and Social Change,' which was to mark the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f31e2500008b013a5cc4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Department of Education is nearing a deal with Navient Corp., the student loan giant formerly known as Sallie Mae, over allegations the company cheated active-duty troops on federal student loans, a department official said Thursday.The agreement likely would end the Education Department's much-delayed and heavily-criticized probe into whether the nation’s largest student loan specialist -- a major government contractor -- broke the law that caps interest rates and provides other special financial protections for active-duty members of the military.Thomas Skelly, the department’s acting chief financial officer, told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday that the Education Department was “finalizing” an agreement with Navient that would be completed by May 1. Denise Horn, an Education Department spokeswoman, declined further comment. Patricia Christel, a Navient spokeswoman, didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.For a department that has been called a lapdog in holding its contractors accountable -- especially one that’s been called out by President Barack Obama over its customer service -- the settlement risks inflaming Democrats and student advocates who have badgered the Education Department to take a tougher line against corporate wrongdoing.“I continue to be deeply concerned about the allegations that a student loan servicer knowingly overcharged service members while they were on active duty,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who along with other Senate Democrats has made student debt central in their economic and political agenda. “This is an issue I’m going to continue to be focused on to make sure our men and women in uniform are treated fairly [and] can continue their education without the fear of predatory practices.”The Education Department’s investigation followed a May deal with the government in which Navient settled federal accusations that it had intentionally overcharged about 60,000 active-duty troops on federal and private student loans over nearly a decade. The company, which neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, agreed to pay $60 million to troops as part of its settlement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Department of Justice.Despite the Justice Department’s detailed complaint, which followed a referral by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Education Secretary Arne Duncan later announced a “thorough” review to determine whether the company indeed overcharged troops.Duncan’s department was unaware of the alleged wrongdoing while it was occurring, federal officials have said. The Education Department was unaware that federal banking regulators planned to publicly accuse the company of violating the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act until after Navient warned its investors.The results of the Education Department review were due in September 2014. But after an initial investigation by department employees cleared the company of wrongdoing, the department paid about $95,000 to hire Ernst & Young to further investigate Navient's compliance with the servicemembers law, federal records show.Last month, the American Legion, the influential veterans organization, accused the Education Department of favoring its loan contractors over service members. “The department seems to be doing everything possible to undermine the Justice Department and the CFPB, and they’re doing a hell of a job,” Steve Gonzalez, an assistant director in the Legion’s veterans employment and education division, said at the time.To mollify potential critics, Duncan said in May that “every option is on the table” including considering whether his department would terminate Navient’s lucrative contract to collect monthly payments on student loans.A few weeks later, according to Navient, the department quietly extended the company’s contract for an additional five years.Meanwhile, Navient’s revenues from its loan-servicing contract continue to soar. In the last half of 2014, its revenues increased nearly 10 percent, to $68 million, compared with the first six months of 2014, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Navient would lose about $130 million in annual revenues if the Education Department terminated the company’s loan-servicing contract. Prominent groups, including the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest labor federation, have urged Duncan to dump Navient.The Education Department has enjoyed a cozy relationship with Navient and its predecessor company, Sallie Mae. Some company executives formerly held prominent positions at the department. In 2009, the department's inspector general recommended it recoup some $22 million in alleged overpayments to Navient. As of last month, some six years after the recommendation, that money had yet to be collected.Horn, the Education Department spokeswoman, didn't respond to an inquiry about the funds."

8,GREEN,5 Years After: Deepwater Horizon's Lessons Go Unlearned,"Miyoko Sakashita, ContributorOceans Director, Center for Biological Diversity",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-years-after-deepwater-horizon_b_7083114.html,"The Obama administration has now launched new offshore oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Rather than heed the warnings of Deepwater Horizon, the administration seems determined to double-down on dangerous offshore drilling.",2015-04-17,"FILE In this April 21, 2010 file image provided by the U.S. Coast Guard, fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon. The owner of the rig largely blames oil giant BP for the disaster in an internal investigation report released Wednesday, June 22, 2011. The Transocean report said the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon explosion and resulting oil spill was sparked by a succession of well design, construction, and temporary abandonment decisions that compromised the integrity of the well and compounded the risk of its failure. (AP Photo/US Coast Guard, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb168bc3c000020010bcfa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember that helpless, infuriating feeling watching gallon after gallon of oil spew into the Gulf of Mexico in the spring and summer of 2010?After Deepwater Horizon - the worst oil spill disaster in U.S. history - came the mantra: Never again.But now, as we mark the fifth anniversary of BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster - which killed hundreds of thousands of dolphins, whales and other sea life, not to mention claimed the lives of 11 men and fouled hundreds of miles of oceans and beaches - I'm left wondering whether we've learned anything at all.In fact, it seems like quite the opposite: The Obama administration has now launched new offshore oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Rather than heed the warnings of Deepwater Horizon, the administration seems determined to double-down on dangerous offshore drilling.This reckless pursuit of more fossil fuel comes with major and predictable costs. In the Arctic, an oil spill would be devastating for polar bears, walruses and other wildlife - and impossible to clean up in such harsh conditions. In the Atlantic, even the seismic search for oil will injure or kill 138,000 dolphins and whales, the federal government estimates, including nine endangered North Atlantic right whales. So what did we learn from that nauseating experience of watching the Deepwater Horizon oil flow and flow, more than 200 million gallons of thick, black crude that coated and killed hundreds of dolphins, birds and other wildlife? New studies are showing that the chemical dispersants that were used after the spill are still hurting wildlife in myriad ways that we barely understand.Then maybe we learned better ways to address major oil spills? But we haven't, because the inescapable reality is that once we spill massive quantities of oil into sensitive ocean habitats, the damage has been done and there's no going back. Nothing has changed except our knowledge of just how destructive a major offshore oil spill can be, and the visceral memories of watching our lifestyle translate into dead birds and dolphins.Is the lesson, then, that massive oil spills are just the price of living in the modern age? Well, no, because over the past five years we've also learned that human-induced climate change is happening faster than we realized and with more dire consequences. The oceans that cover 75 percent of the planet will rise, they will become more acidic and carry less oxygen, and entire life-giving ecological systems will be altered in dangerous and unpredictable ways. So then, I can't see any lessons that we've learned from Deepwater Horizon and our insatiable and reckless pursuit of new oil to burn and cook our planet with, unless it's this: leave the oil in the ground. That's where it belongs."
9,BUSINESS,Character of a Business v. a Design Entrepreneur,"Soren Petersen, ContributorDesign Research Ph.D.; Author, 'Profit from Design'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/character-of-a-business-v_b_7083326.html,"Entrepreneurs are the people who reinvent and revigorate our society in large and small ways and we know them by their actions. However, how do entrepreneurs with a business or a design background differ from one another and what are their personal traits?",2015-04-17,2015-04-17-1429229479-5121898-businessriskdesigngrit.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-17-1429229479-5121898-businessriskdesigngrit-thumb.jpg,"Entrepreneurs are the people who reinvent and revigorate our society in large and small ways and we know them by their actions. However, how do entrepreneurs with a business or a design background differ from one another and what are their personal traits?We all remember that kid in school who just could not sit still and who always had some project going to make extra money. If not high school, then in college, he had a small company and could be found taking orders out of his dorm room or his father's basement. As stated above, those with an entrepreneurial spirit identify themselves by their actions.Studying and conducting design-a-thons on Design Driven Startups, we identified six key entrepreneurial traits: Belief/Passion, Risk-attitude, Adaptability, Grit, Social network and Skill. We then had both business and design students self-assess their personal performance on these traits, and found grit and risk to be the dividing factors. Business students perceive themselves as having more grit than design students and also being more risk-adverse than design students.In psychology, grit is defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals and has been found to account for an average of four percent of the variance in success outcomes. Grit is not related to IQ and demonstrates incremental predictive validity of success measures over and above IQ (A. W. Duckworth et al.)Risk is the potential of losing something valuable, such as physical health, social status, emotional wellbeing or financial wealth. One can either be 'risk-seeking,' 'risk-neutral' or 'risk-averse.' Risk aversion is one's reluctance to accept a deal with an uncertain payoff as compared to another with a more certain, if lower, expected payoff.Does this mean that a lack of grit and risk-seeking behavior in designers is holding design entrepreneurs back and perhaps preventing them from succeeding? Few firms founded by designers make it top the top, although, Dyson, AirBnB and Disney would be exceptions to that rule.Of all the US students graduating with a bachelor degree in year 2010-2011, 365,000 graduated in the field of business and only 1,600 in industrial design. This means there are four industrial design graduates for every thousand business graduates and there may be many more business entrepreneurs than design entrepreneurs.What about the business students who see themselves as having more grit than the design students, does this make them more successful in general? Does the business students' risk-aversion create a more leveled performance and the designers' risk-seeking make their performance more erratic?Though failure is more acceptable in the U.S. than most other cultures, bad news tends to spread three times more quickly than good news, thus, hurting one's reputation in the process. Designers' have fewer objective quantitative performance metrics and rely on their reputation for respect. Thus, they may be more vulnerable to risk-taking and the resulting setbacks from events outside their control.When it came to Belief/Passion, Adaptability, Social network and Skill, business and design students both felt that they were above average. This is normal human behavior since, for example, studies of drivers' self-perception show that most see themselves as being above average.Thus, a slightly inflated entrepreneurial perception can also inadvertently affect performance. This, combined with lower grit and higher risk-seeking behavior, tips the odds and makes for a higher failure rate among design entrepreneurs. In other words, a large portion of entrepreneurial designers may not have any business being one and it may better serve them to know that than not to know."

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77c1d1f0000df00250a65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's hard enough for most of us to check out from work and get some recharging time. But what do you do when you're on an NBA team and the league decides your punishing schedule?This has been a point of contention this season for Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy, who slammed the NBA earlier this year over the number of back-to-back games his team has been forced to play.With the Pistons out of the playoffs this weekend, Van Gundy told reporters on Wednesday that looking for ways to deal with exhaustion will be part of his team's discussions on the past season and the next.""It’s one of the things you have to examine here in the next week as we talk to everybody, on how we structure practices, walk-throughs, the season, travel, nutrition, strength and conditioning, all of those things,"" Van Gundy said before the Pistons season-ender against the New York Knicks. The goal is to ""identify problems,"" the coach said. ""You go out and talk to people, who maybe you think have expertise in those areas and try to come up with the best practices that you can,"" he added.This season, the Pistons led other teams with 22 back-to-back games in an 82-game schedule -- a quarter of their season. Van Gundy has publicly made the point that's a disadvantage, and he's called for schedule ""equity.""In 20 of those back-to-backs, according to Pistons.com, the team had to travel for the second game. ""It's something the league needs to address, but I've got no control over it,"" Van Gundy said last month. ""As a coach, you play 'em, but that's a major schedule imbalance.""The coach has taken some blame on himself for not properly managing players' minutes on the floor and thereby giving them enough rest. In February, he expressed ""definite concern"" for point guard D.J. Augustin, who ended the season averaging 24 minutes per game, but had an eight-game stretch in which he saw over 30 minutes each game. ""If you're going to put your three perimeter guys out there running on fumes, you're going to have a hard time closing the game with the energy you need to do it,"" Van Gundy said following a loss in November. ""I've got to take responsibility for that.""On Wednesday, Van Gundy said that some players handle back-to-back games better than others, and he noted that such schedule difficulties are ""not an excuse for not winning games.""""I’ve had teams that have played very, very well on the second night of back-to-backs,"" he said. ""It’s a manageable thing, there’s no question about it.""You just have to figure out how to manage it. Fortunately, Van Gundy is a guy who understands a full workload -- he serves the Pistons as both head coach and president of basketball operations. So when will he find some downtime himself? Not until August, he said, after the draft is over and the free agency period ends. ""But I’ll get three-day weekends here and there. I’ll get out to baseball games at night,"" he said. ""I’ll get my relaxation."" "

As Robin Hauser Reynolds shared in her documentary CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap, ""By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer science jobs available in the U.S., and only 400,000 computer scientists to fill them. If we're only drawing from half the population, we're going to stall out."" I've always touted the personal touch that women bring to technology. It was a woman who designed Apple's first Mac icons, making technology more user-friendly and inviting, and today Susan Kare's icon for the command key is still found on Apple keyboards. In The Girls' Lounge @ CES, we were honored to have high school girls creating prosthetics for children who had lost a limb, and witnessed the unbelievable, nurturing touch females provide that bring a product to life. That's why we've added Arts to STEM, and are actively promoting STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS and Math) as a skill set for student pioneers. While we inspire the next generation, we want female entrepreneurs to close more deals now. Our group openly discussed the unconscious bias that exists, and is slowly beginning to dissipate as more women fund other women. Then we dove down into the fundamentals of the pitch, because you never know when an opportunity may arise -- in an elevator, at a cocktail party or at a soccer game -- to share your vision. Pitch PerfectWe invited six women to present their elevator pitch to our circle of female VCs to judge what was hit and miss, and provide feedback on how they could unlock the magic to get their businesses funded. The judges included Heidi Lehmann and Marci Weisler, founders of SWSIMedia (Smart Women, Smart Ideas), a multi-screen video network featuring female entrepreneurs, Kara Nortman, Partner at Upfront Ventures, a VC firm in LA and Robyn Ward, who heads up UTA's strategic investment fund. From custom Plate-ables™ to an app that streamed sports highlights from high school sidelines to a content platform for women over 50, the ideas were wide-ranging - but all had a tech component and all needed funding. For a first pitch, it was agreed -- no deck, no PowerPoint Presentation -- just you and your story. If you do have slides, have strong visual images and few words on the screen. You want the VCs to focus on you and not be distracted by the elaborate presentation going on behind you. In sixty seconds, you need to share who you are, what you do and whom you do it for. Think of your pitch as a Power Punch and make it tight by leading with the strongest points. Don't get it all out -- choose the 20 percent that's the most important.Robyn Ward shared what most investors are thinking from the onset: ""What precisely do you do and who do you do it for? Why should I care (how big is the market)? Why will you win (team and other advantages)?""Here are some pitch pointers:• Hook with your story. Natasha Gilberty, described her vocal matchmaking App, Jammr, as ""Tinder for musicians,"" offering a solution for 62 million musicians who are frustrated with Craig's List and hanging out in bars trying to find like-minded talent. • Namedrop. If you have existing advertisers and partners, mention them, especially if they're trusted brands like Lancome, Neiman Marcus or Fidelity Investments. • Make yourself memorable. VCs are investing in people. Brenda Coffee, Founder of 1010 Park Place -- Where Style is Ageless, referred to herself as ""Ramberella -- part Rambo, part Cinderella.""• Share initial funding. Whether from personal savings, investments from family and friends or a bank loan. State how much of the company you own and if you have partners.• State what makes your product/idea unique. What are you doing that no one else is? Do you have a unique advantage on the acquisition front? • Lay out the investment strategy. For example, ""We're looking for funding to build our first prototype,"" or ""to build an ecommerce site.""• Be credible. Share who you know and the influencers who will help grow your brand. Have a strong advisory board and be able to share a powerful nugget such as, ""I have one of the pioneers in photo marketing development on my team."" • Find one metric that's as powerful as possible. You don't have to throw out stats -- all you need is one extremely relevant data-backed point. The Confidence SignatureFor your first pitch, keep it tight and polished. Nervous rambling always makes someone seem less confident. Don't share every minute detail of your business plan, you want to excite, not exhaust your potential investors. BUT, be prepared for all types of follow up questions. If your VCs bite, you'll have more than a few minutes to sell yourself, and ""Ums"" and ""Ahs"" don't close the deal. Be aware of your confidence signature. If your body language is fidgety and you rarely make eye contact, you will lose your potential investors a few seconds after hello. The best way to ace your presentation skills is to practice on video and analyze your movements. Is your voice strong, or do you find it cracking under pressure? Practice the pitch, again and again. Know the answers to all of these: Plans for monetization, distribution channels, marketing strategy, competitors, market size, key milestones and financial projections. Have the numbers ready if asked, but don't try to share all information in a slide. Also, don't get too far ahead. ""Four year projections are probably wrong and guesses at best,"" shared Nortman.Ward also advised to be mindful of brand name. Don't limit the product if there may be a larger vision down the road. A product name with ""Wino"" in it may sound fun and integral to the current offering, but if you expand to food products it won't translate.Finish strong by closing with why you're going to win. Share more than, ""I am really passionate about this,"" because that's a given. An example is, ""I'm a first-mover and you should invest in me because there's no one else in the market who is doing what I'm doing."" Restate something from your opener that ties it all together for a truly memorable pitch. You will get a YES when you pitch it with confidence."

VCs are investing in people. Brenda Coffee, Founder of 1010 Park Place -- Where Style is Ageless, referred to herself as ""Ramberella -- part Rambo, part Cinderella.""• Share initial funding. Whether from personal savings, investments from family and friends or a bank loan. State how much of the company you own and if you have partners.• State what makes your product/idea unique. What are you doing that no one else is? Do you have a unique advantage on the acquisition front? • Lay out the investment strategy. For example, ""We're looking for funding to build our first prototype,"" or ""to build an ecommerce site.""• Be credible. Share who you know and the influencers who will help grow your brand. Have a strong advisory board and be able to share a powerful nugget such as, ""I have one of the pioneers in photo marketing development on my team."" • Find one metric that's as powerful as possible. You don't have to throw out stats -- all you need is one extremely relevant data-backed point. The Confidence SignatureFor your first pitch, keep it tight and polished. Nervous rambling always makes someone seem less confident. Don't share every minute detail of your business plan, you want to excite, not exhaust your potential investors. BUT, be prepared for all types of follow up questions. If your VCs bite, you'll have more than a few minutes to sell yourself, and ""Ums"" and ""Ahs"" don't close the deal. Be aware of your confidence signature. If your body language is fidgety and you rarely make eye contact, you will lose your potential investors a few seconds after hello. The best way to ace your presentation skills is to practice on video and analyze your movements. Is your voice strong, or do you find it cracking under pressure? Practice the pitch, again and again. Know the answers to all of these: Plans for monetization, distribution channels, marketing strategy, competitors, market size, key milestones and financial projections. Have the numbers ready if asked, but don't try to share all information in a slide. Also, don't get too far ahead. ""Four year projections are probably wrong and guesses at best,"" shared Nortman.Ward also advised to be mindful of brand name. Don't limit the product if there may be a larger vision down the road. A product name with ""Wino"" in it may sound fun and integral to the current offering, but if you expand to food products it won't translate.Finish strong by closing with why you're going to win. Share more than, ""I am really passionate about this,"" because that's a given. An example is, ""I'm a first-mover and you should invest in me because there's no one else in the market who is doing what I'm doing."" Restate something from your opener that ties it all together for a truly memorable pitch. You will get a YES when you pitch it with confidence."

State officials planned a public meeting Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2014, in Colstrip on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal to cut greenhouse emissions. The town is home to one of the largest coal-fired power plants in the West, a 2,100-megawatt facility that churns out more greenhouse gases than any other source in Montana. (AP Photo/Matthew Brown, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb168b72200003401db4d65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The much ballyhooed legal challenge to the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan, brought by coal companies and conservative state attorneys-general, ran out of steam Thursday in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington. Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Thomas Griffith, and Brett Kavanaugh, a decidedly conservative panel, heard an hour and a half of oral arguments in a packed courtroom. Here are three takeaways from the arguments: 1. No final action, no jurisdictionThe court showed little sympathy for the challengers' unprecedented proposition that they can sue EPA over the Clean Power Plan proposal, to stop the rulemaking in its tracks before the agency makes its final decision. Judges Griffith and Kavanaugh hit this point exceptionally hard, each saying that allowing premature challenges would lead the court into a ""morass."" Griffith asked repeatedly for any precedent allowing lawsuits over proposals, and any principle to govern when to intervene. The challengers conceded there is no precedent and could offer no principle. West Virginia's lawyer said, ""There's always a first time...""As Justice Department counsel explained, it's basic administrative law that one cannot challenge a proposed rule, before an agency has taken a final action that creates any obligations, before the agency explains its final legal, policy, and factual conclusions after considering and responding to public comments. This creates a full administrative record for courts to review, and there is none now. Challengers will have their day in court after EPA issues the final Clean Power Plan standards.The challengers claimed that this case deserves an exception because it turns on a legal interpretation and will have big real world consequences. The states, they claimed, already have to expend resources to prepare. But Judge Kavanaugh said this situation is ""not that extraordinary."" He noted that many other cases turn on legal interpretations and have big consequences. Judge Griffith asked for any case where merely ""bracing for the costs"" of a proposed regulation conferred standing to sue, and the challengers had nothing to offer.In short, there's no sign the court will take up the invitation to jump in before EPA has a chance to finish the Clean Power Plan. 2. A glimpse into the merits, no moreLawyers for the coal companies and challenging states contended they had found a legal flaw so clear that the court should stretch the normal rules to decide it early. They claim the statute unambiguously prohibits EPA from regulating power plant emissions of carbon dioxide under the Clean Power Plan because the agency has already regulated power plant emissions of mercury under another provision.Though the challengers contend this prohibition is black and white, it is anything but clear. Congress adopted section 111(d) in 1970 to assure that there would be ""no gaps"" in the Clean Air Act's coverage of dangerous air pollutants. Existing sources' emissions of pollutants that cause smog (ozone) and soot (fine particles) are curbed under one provision (section 110). Existing sources' emissions of especially toxic pollutants, such as mercury, are controlled under a second provision (section 112). And existing sources' emissions of any other dangerous pollutants, including carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping pollutants, are regulated under a third provision (section 111(d)).Indeed, in a 2011 case called American Electric Power v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court specifically ruled that section 111(d) of the Act empowers EPA to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. In fact, power company lawyers in that case pressed that very argument upon the Supreme Court. That was then, this is now, it seems.In a theory dreamed up only after the American Electric Power decision, the coal industry and its supporting states argue that Congress abandoned the ""no gaps"" approach in 1990 Clean Air Act amendments and put EPA to a Sophie's choice: You can protect people from power plants' mercury emissions, or from their carbon dioxide emissions, but not both. Power plants, they claim, must be protected from ""double regulation.""This is total invention. Power plants emit a host of dangerous pollutants, and these emissions are regulated under at least a half dozen parts of the Clean Air Act. There's no basis for the theory that Congress thought power plants deserved protection against ""double regulation,"" and no basis for thinking that Congress intended to force EPA to choose between curbing mercury pollution and curbing carbon pollution.The briefs filed by EPA, by supporting states led by New York, by NRDC and other environmental groups, and by Calpine Corporation, a major power producer, all show that section 111(d) is there to curb dangerous pollutants that are not curbed under section 112. There are no gaps in the statutory scheme that let some dangerous pollutants off scot-free.When EPA completes the rule, the court will apply the familiar principles of Chevron USA v. NRDC, to determine if EPA has reasonably interpreted the law. That's the Supreme Court case holding that Congress gave agencies the first opportunity to interpret the laws they are charged to implement. Under Chevron, when a statute is ambiguous, courts must defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation.There's a special twist here because the 1990 amendments included two provisions modifying the same sentence in section 111(d) - each change giving that sentence a different ending. In the final rule, EPA will undoubtedly give its views on what each amendment means, and how the two interact. The court will then have to decide if EPA's interpretation is reasonable. Judge Griffith noted that Chevron deference applies not only when a single statutory provision is ambiguous, but also when two statutory provisions conflict. That's the view of a majority of Supreme Court justices in a case called Scialabba v. Cuellar de Orsorio. The court dipped its toes into these legal interpretation questions, but little more. The judges seemed to accept the Justice Department's argument that EPA must be allowed to complete the rulemaking and definitively explain its final decision, including its interpretation of the interplay between sections 111(d) and 112. Questions of statutory interpretation will definitely come before the court once EPA issues its final standards. But there's no sign that this panel of judges will take them up now. 3. No interest in far-fetched constitutional theoriesThese cases have drawn the most public and political attention because of the involvement of Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe - hired by coal giant Peabody Energy but speaking Thursday for all the challengers. He has launched far-fetched constitutional theories, including claims that the Clean Power Plan violates the Fifth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution and usurps Congress's lawmaking powers.Perhaps a little cautious in front of actual judges, Tribe avoided some of the inflammatory language (""burning the Constitution"") that he has deployed in congressional testimony and in the Wall Street Journal. But he did not really skimp, arguing that the Clean Power Plan ""commandeers"" states into being mere ""puppets"" for the EPA.This is a total distortion of ""cooperative federalism,"" which has been at the heart of the Clean Air Act for 45 years, and which the Supreme Court has repeatedly approved. As it has dozens of times since 1970, EPA will set national standards to limit power plants' carbon pollution. Each state will then have the first opportunity to write plans to apply those standards to the power plants in that state.Contrary to Professor Tribe, EPA cannot force the state to write a plan. But if the state declines, then EPA is charged with writing and enforcing a federal plan directly limiting those power plants' pollution. In this instance, EPA regulates the power plants directly (just as it does already for acid rain and toxic pollutants) - it does not force the state to do anything.That EPA will regulate the power plants directly is the federal guarantee that makes the Clean Air Act work. But EPA cannot ""commandeer"" the states into regulating against their will.Tribe argued that the threat of a ""secret unknown plan"" will force the states to knuckle under. In real life, as I've shown here, most states are actively engaged because both power companies and political leaders prefer to have the states in the lead making the choices involved in writing implementation plans, rather than leaving it to EPA.In any case, EPA has announced that it will propose the contents of federal plans this summer, eliminating the scenario of mystery and dark threats that Professor Tribe imagines. States and other stakeholders will have a full opportunity to comment on the proposed federal plan regulations. When the elements of the federal plan are finalized, they'll serve both as a model to help states design their own plans and as a clear guidance on how EPA will curb power plants' emissions directly if a state chooses not to act.For all the attention Professor Tribe has gotten these past few weeks, there's no sign that he made any dent in the court's thinking.* * *In 2012 the appeals court summarily dismissed another premature challenge to EPA's proposed standards for carbon emissions for new power plants, in a case called Las Brisas Energy Center v. EPA. The two-paragraph ruling stated simply: ""The challenged proposed rule is not final agency action subject to judicial review."" That seems to be where this panel is headed too. Its opinion could be similarly short and sweet."

(Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae57761f0000250122e74e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The University of Notre Dame, which the documentary ""The Hunting Ground"" prominently accuses of botching rape cases, is the subject of a U.S. Department of Education civil rights investigation into complaints that sexual harassment victims were tormented by the school's bewildering system for handling sex cases.The Catholic university, which on Friday plans to screen the documentary on its campus in South Bend, Indiana, has been under investigation by the department's Office of Civil Rights for nearly two years, and hasn't publicly disclosed the probes. Two 2013 filings, obtained by The Huffington Post, portray the school's complaint process as a confusing mire of inaccurate information and dodged responsibility, bouncing victims along for months without explanation. Notre Dame has called ""The Hunting Ground"" inaccurate and says the film fails to acknowledge the school's efforts to combat sexual violence. The film highlights the case of Lizzy Seeberg, a student at nearby Saint Mary's College who committed suicide in 2010 after reporting that a Notre Dame football player violated her. ""The Hunting Ground"" argues that Notre Dame didn't promptly investigate Seeberg's case, and that campus police officers were told not to contact football players.Notre Dame released a statement before the film's showing, praising discussions generated by documentary. But the school said the film is ""wrong in unsupported and inaccurate assertions that the university sought to suppress crime statistics and shield athletes from investigators.""Notre Dame did not respond to request for comment about Department of Education investigation. The students involved in the complaints asked to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation. The revelation that Notre Dame is under federal review shows that the Education Department is investigating many more U.S. colleges and universities for their handling of sexual harassment than was previously known. The department's Office of Civil Rights had said previously that it is investigating the handling of sexual assault cases at 105 colleges and universities.But Notre Dame hasn't appeared on the department's list because the tally only notes investigations involving sexual assault -- and not sexual harassment. The Education Department confirmed Thursday that its Office of Civil Rights is investigating 137 colleges and universities for their handling of either sexual violence or sexual harassment cases.Both complaints allege that Notre Dame failed to thoroughly investigate sexual harassment cases, and that victims struggled to get officials to explain the process. Multiple officials weren't clear on what constituted retaliation under Notre Dame policies, and students reporting sexual harassment were sent in different directions to report their concerns, the complaints allege. One student said she was told she hadn't made a formal Title IX complaint after she had emailed details of several incidents to three administrators. Administrators promised to investigate one academic department based on a student's testimony, according to the complaints, but then decided not to proceed.One of the complaints alleges that the school's Title IX coordinator told a student she had never dealt with a student-on-student sexual assault case. The administrator also was said to have asserted that Notre Dame wasn't bound by 2011 Education Department guidance on sexual violence because it was ""opining on what in an optimal universe, universities would do.""The Office of Civil Rights concluded a similar probe of Notre Dame in 2011, saying the school  had ""not always clearly instructed as to the processes that would be followed after a report of sexual misconduct or sexual assault was made."" The lack of clarity served as ""a source of confusion"" for victims, the probe concluded. The university told federal officials at the time that it would ensure its policies and procedures reflected the Education Department's 2011 guidance.Responding to the university's statement criticizing his film, Kirby Dick, the Academy Award-nominated director behind ""The Hunting Ground,"" said the complaints against Notre Dame show that the school's improvements have been insufficient. ""Interviews with more than two dozen sources including current and former students, current and former employees as well as parents confirm that Notre Dame has a history of mishandling sexual assault cases, discouraging survivors from reporting and shielding athletes from investigators, all of which suppress crime statistics,"" Dick said.Dick said he applauds Notre Dame for screening the “The Hunting Ground” on its campus and hopes the film spurs ""the reforms needed to best protect students.""""The Hunting Ground"" examines cases at other schools also under investigation by Department of Education, including Florida State University, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Harvard Law School."

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and much has been done since then to increase security and safety around federal buildings.Sadly, there has been no such progress in eliminating the types of anti-government sentiments that drove domestic terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols to target federal government employees on that fateful day.One hundred sixty-eight people died in the Oklahoma City bombing, including 99 who worked for the federal government. Thankfully we have not a major attack targeting federal employees or facilities since then. But there has been a concerning surge in violent attacks against federal employees in recent years -- some of which have proven fatal.In November 2013 a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport claimed the life of TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez and injured two other TSA officers and a civilian teacher. Officer Hernandez was shot 12 times during the attack. A note found on Paul Ciancia, the sole suspect in the shootings, said he wanted to kill TSA agents and called them pigs. This incident represents the culmination of daily assaults -- physical and verbal -- endured by TSA employees at airports across the country. Three and a half years earlier, Andrew Stack deliberately flew his single-engine aircraft into a four-story office complex in Austin, Texas, that housed an IRS field office. The crash killed IRS manager Vernon Hunter and injured 13 other people. The morning of the crash, Stack posted a suicide note on his website railing against the government and specifically mentioning a long-running feud with ""Big Brother IRS."" How did Ciancia and Stack develop such deep-seated hatred for government employees? Perhaps it was from turning on the TV or browsing the Internet, where any number of anti-government politicians and commentators have openly vilified public servants.There is a difference between having a civil discussion on the role and function of government agencies and blasting federal workers as ""jack-booted thugs"" for simply doing their jobs, as former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul did in 2011, or calling for ""jihad"" against the TSA, as political columnist Jonah Goldberg did in 2011.Public servants are hardworking, upstanding citizens who are proud to work for their country and deliver the public goods Americans rely on, whether it's keeping terrorists off planes, providing quality medical care to military veterans and their families, ensuring that seniors get their Social Security benefits on time, keeping our food supply safe to eat, or safeguarding the U.S. borders.The lessons from the Oklahoma City bombing are as important today as they were 20 years ago: Words matter. Fortifying our public buildings only will do so much to protect the people inside. We all must fortify our hearts and minds against the hollow delusions of hatred and return to a truly civil discourse about our government and its employees. After all, government is just another name for what we choose to do together. J. David Cox Sr. is national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 670,000 federal and D.C. government employees nationwide."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I started to ask some questions. I discovered that this was his takeaway from a nutrition lesson at school.I feel there's an unspoken sentiment that parents should avoid conversations about weight with their children. I beg to differ. In fact, I think parents take a big risk when they avoid this sticky issue.So with help from leading experts in the field, I came up with these five important points that I vow to teach my children, and that you may want to consider.Point #1: Just because others say it, doesn't make it true. (Let's talk about it!)  After doing my homework, I discovered my son misinterpreted what was said about ice cream, which is very common with children. I realize I'm not the only person who will provide health education to my children. Because we live in a world where weight is a huge focus of health, it's important to stay in communication with kids about what they learn and how they (or other children) are treated by others.I tell my kids: ""Please tell me when you hear nutrition/body/weight messages or perhaps wittiness someone being made fun of for their size. I will never get mad at you or anyone else, I just want to talk about what's behind those messages because they're not always true.""Point #2: You cannot judge someone based on their shape and size.First, I told my son that no one food like ice cream can make people big. I stressed that ""People come in all shapes and sizes with some big, some small and others in between. Someone's size doesn't not tell you anything about what or even how much a person eats. And it says absolutely nothing about character.""The reason this is so important is weight stigma is a huge problem in society. One study showed 90 percent of adolescents have witnessed friends being bullied for weight. A 2012 report, entitled ""Weight Bias: A Social Justice Issue"" from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, details how weight stigma decreases academic performance and increases risk of depression, poor body image, suicidal thoughts and unhealthy habits such as dieting and decreased physical activity. Not only that, people who experience weight stigma are also more likely to gain weight -- or stay obese -- over time.Linda Bacon, PhD, author of Body Respect, What Conventional Health Books Get Wrong, Leave Out, or Just Plain Fail to Understand about Weight, provides insight on how to broach this subject with kids: ""It makes sense that kids would be concerned about being fat in this anti-fat culture, and I think it's important to honor these fears. Telling them what we know to be true -- that weight stigma is wrong and kids can be beautiful and healthy at every size -- isn't enough to help them change their attitude and behavior, when they can see the real rewards people get for being thinner in this culture. It's important to be real with them, and acknowledge that.Point #3: We eat a variety of nutritious food to be healthy and strong.You may remember the book Maggie Goes on a Diet about a 14 year old girl who changes her diet, loses weight and becomes a soccer star. Well, that book didn't go over well with dietitians and mental health professionals because of its ""thin = acceptance"" message. That's why Judith Matz, LCSW, wrote and recently published a very different book, Amanda's Big Dream. The story is about a girl who learns she doesn't need to change her body to follow her dream of becoming a first-rate ice skater. In Matz's resources that accompany the book, she makes the following point:We ask adults to keep in mind that your own attitudes toward weight affect what you pass down to your children. While there's been much value placed on reaching an ideal body weight in our culture, human beings naturally come in all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, when the focus is placed on weight, rather than on healthful behaviors, kids who are bigger often experience shame, and kids who are smaller often fear becoming fat. Eating disorders, low self-esteem, and weight bullying are also some of the harmful consequences that come from overvaluing thinner bodies.And research agrees. One study showed that weight-focused health messages in the home resulted in more disordered eating habits, like dieting and binge eating, in adolescent girls than messages focused on healthful eating.Point #4: Take care of your body, it does a lot for you.Children who feel good about their bodies are more likely to maintain healthy, sustainable habits than those who don't. A study published in Psychological Science, found that normal-weight adolescents who perceived themselves as overweight were 40 percent more likely to become obese as adults compared to those who viewed their weight as normal. And this isn't just girls. The boys who felt this way were 89 percent more likely to become obese at adulthood!""This is what we do know is helpful: everyone, regardless of their size, can benefit from taking good care of their body and learning to look at it with love and appreciation,"" says Bacon. ""Start there. You'll feel better about yourself, which is really what kids are really looking for when they want to lose weight.""Robbin Gregson, MFT, a licensed psychotherapist specializing in the treatment of eating disorders puts it this way: ""The most important point to make is to love your body no matter what. As we grow up our bodies will constantly be changing...taller, rounder, darker, lighter. The most important idea we can impart is our self esteem comes more from our internal thoughts of our accomplishments than our waistline, height, hair color, etc. It's our kindness to ourselves and others that matters. Would your child love his favorite pet or stuffed animal any less if they looked 'different'?"" Point #5: Be aware of the Thin Ideal message in the media.  No family can hide from the Thin Ideal, ever present in movies, magazines, websites and the general population (who also are influenced by media images). ""Research with kids as young as 3-5 years of age reveal that they show signs of adopting the belief that goodness in females was related to thinness,"" says Jennifer Shewmaker, PhD, author of Sexualized Media Messages and Our Children: Teaching Kids to Be Smart Critics and Consumers. ""But, it's important to remember that there are variables in their personal life, such as family and community, that can help them process media messages and choose a healthy response. ""Shewmaker provides the following tips to parents:1. Talk with your child: When you see examples of females being presented as primarily valuable for their appearance or of goodness equated with thinness or muscularity for boys , point it out and open the door for ongoing conversation. Address ""fear of fat"" directly when it comes up.2. Monitor your child's media and product use: Is your child receiving a lot of messages about the importance of how they look? You may choose to restrict their exposure to certain shows or products, or you may choose to allow it, but only with your active participation. You can guide your children in developing the ability to critique media messages by doing so yourself. Then prompt them to do so as well.3. Build community: In order to challenge the idea that how a person looks is the most important thing about her, it is very important to have a community of support that also promotes other characteristics as valuable. Find other parents, families, and groups that will support your child as they reject and challenge unhealthy ideas.I'm committed to addressing these five points with my children throughout their lives. I want to help guide them in the right direction as they develop beliefs about themselves and others. I believe that if more parents commit to this we can gradually inch away from weight stigma, weight bullying, disordered eating, eating disorders and body dissatisfaction, all of which compromise the mental and physical health of people everywhere.ResourcesAmanda's Big Dream: includes the book, conversation starters with kids and tips on creating a healthy body image in children.

In hasty generalizations, the authors took individual situations, inserted their own bias, and extrapolated their experience to the larger community of women and men married to service members. In the last two days, two military spouses have taken the authors to task. The Dependapotamus Hunter reminded us that cyber bullying is anything but a game, while the second was by an Air Force veteran reminding us how crucial military spouses are, not only to their families, not only to one another, but to the overall mission itself. These two articles highlighted the online vitriol directed at military spouses; many times by active-duty members, many times by veterans, and sadly, many times by other military spouses. An aspect I'd like to expand on is the national security implications that needs to be addressed by leadership in the Department of Defense and on an individual level, by each of us.In his Washington Post piece, Dave Duffy, a retired Army officer, connected the action of a military spouse, who he says acted poorly in his smoothie establishment, to the larger issues of having an ""entitlement attitude"" and worsening civilian-military relations (a rather large leap). Carl Forsling, an active-duty Marine Corps officer, started his opinion piece with an unnecessary hunter-bear-rape metaphor to describe the decision to re-enlist. That provocative opening quickly spiraled into a stereotype-fueled argument that placed military spouses as enemy number one. However, other than an Army Wife: Toughest Job in the Military bumper sticker, Forsling cited no specific examples, facts, or research supporting his claim. His main purpose for writing seemed to be to air a grudge against military spouses. Both officers' weak logic, not surprisingly, led to weak arguments. Whatever points they were trying to make regarding entitlement got lost in the authors' willingness to stereotype the 1.1 million member community of military spouses. As some military spouses pushed back in the comment section of both articles, an equally large number of commentators responded with amazing venom. Cries of Dependapotamus! Leech! Cheater! and Get your own identity! greeted those who defended the military spouse community. Consistently, wherever these articles were shared, the Facebook comment sections became populated with the 21st century rendition of a mob, replete with virtual nooses, pitchforks and torches. Links were left to Facebook pages which encouraged the commenting military spouses to commit suicide. Much like the workplace sexual harassment recently found in the Air Force, this dehumanizing of spouses creates a pattern of disrespect that can lay the foundation for mental and physical abuse. After all, ""dependas"" are really subhuman according to these Facebook sites.None of this -- the articles, the comments, the derision -- is new. There are countless pages dedicated to slamming, demeaning, and deriding spouses of service members. To its credit, the same outlet that produced the Forsling piece, published an astonishing piece by its Editor-in-Chief, Brian Jones on the online hate by military members, specifically Marines, towards female service members. Jones noted As the nation grapples with the debate about women in combat and the military's sexual assault justice problem, both issues are being undermined by nefarious cultural insurgencies on social media, and military leaders seem powerless to stop it.Pointing, laughing, and judging. Some call it honesty. Some, like Forsling in the Task & Purpose piece, call it ""tough love."" I call it hate, marginalization, objectification, and misogyny. Sadly, these attitudes continue to be overlooked or ignored by Facebook, our 21st century equivalent of the Wild, Wild West. Ironically, Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook and author of the book Lean In, happened to be at the Pentagon last week and gave a great speech on leadership. She noted the need to diversify the DoD workforce, and how it will be even more necessary with further workforce reductions. I suspect this will be exceptionally difficult in the current environment. If this cyber bullying continues, both against spouses and female service members, I fear we are rapidly approaching a tipping point where it could be the last straw for more and more active duty and veteran families (not to say anything about civilian families) not recommending their children pursue service in the military, much less a career. The same can be said for those who might think about marrying into the military. Last week on MSNBC, a retired Colonel who had previously endorsed his daughter joining the military, made a sobering comment when he said he would no longer recommend service in any of the Armed Forces. While the Colonel may not have been speaking to the specific threat of cyber bullying, there is a connection between it and sexual harassment and assault and, as we've all become to accustomed to hearing, cyber bullying can end in tragic consequences. In the end, besides simply wanting to do the right thing, DoD needs to fully understand the risk to readiness and retention this is becoming and take steps to reduce this threat.  The question is ""what can DoD accomplish?"" The new frontier in this digital age needs to be more fully understood, starting with senior leaders and their relationships with the CEO's of those companies involved, starting with Facebook. I would recommend the Chiefs of Staff and the Senior Enlisted Advisors in each service provide written notice down the chain of command that active duty personnel will be held accountable, starting in basic training, if they are caught cyber bullying. The education component continues with senior leadership development, both in the officer and enlisted career fields. Expand that education into Commander's calls and military family programs, including mentorship for new military spouses. A DoD Public Affairs program and strategic communication to this newest generation is critical so they understand that what they might have gotten away with in the past will not be tolerated in the service or on any installation, military or civilian personnel alike. At the base level, military spouses and all service members need to understand who and how to make a formal complaint about cyber bullying.For those reading this from the military or veteran community, know that we are all responsible for our actions. If you are one of these people who encourages hateful comments or joins forums that encourages military spouse or service member bashing, think twice. You might see it as a laugh or a joke. It's not. It's unprofessional and demeaning, both to yourself and those you are targeting. We need to remember that we are responsible for what we say and the way we present ourselves in public, whether in person or on the internet. We all make mistakes. Own up to them and do better next time, and don't be a bully. Whether you are active-duty, a veteran, or spouse of either, be the leader in your community I know you can be.For those in the civilian community, we know military members and the spouses who marry them are a reflection of the communities they come from... yours. It is apparent that the cyber bullying problem that has infected so many communities across the nation has spread to parts of the military, made worse by a culture that is still adjusting to the idea of female peers in many career fields. We need your continued help and support to ensure we are able to recruit quality men and women for our All-Volunteer Force. Our military depends on you just like you depend on our military; it is after all, your military. For all the faults I just listed, I still believe we have a military and veteran community, including their families, we should be proud of... let's keep it that way, by reducing, if not eliminating cyber bullying.

The eight episode series features Brian Rogers and Caitlin McGuire, owners of the Breckenridge Cannabis Club, as they work to become marijuana moguls and eventually franchise their stores. It follows on the heels of MSNBC's well received docu-reality series Pot Barons of Colorado. After wrapping up that marijuana infused marathon, executive producer Gary Cohen says he's hooked. ""Pot Barons was a crazy sprint"" says Cohen, who is the Emmy award winning founder of Triple Threat Television based in Stamford, Connecticut. ""Those six months were as demanding as any I could remember."" Cohen deployed an eight-person team who worked around the clock out of a house in Denver. The program focused on the most successful ganjapreneurs in Colorado including the founders of Medicine Man, Euflora and Dixie Elixirs. Now he is developing and pitching new programs. ""I expect to do lots of pot shows,"" says Cohen.Cohen got his start in television producing sports and documentaries. Triple Threat TV produced nine films for ESPN's highly acclaimed 30 For 30 series. His team also produced ten episodes of MTV's True Life and eight episodes for Biography. His foray into marijuana shows is a natural evolution for the producer of non-fiction programming who is a self-described marijuana lover and advocate. ""I'm comfortable saying I am a marijuana person. Thanks to efforts of a lot of people who have been working at it for a long time I lived to see a day I never thought I would live to see. Prohibition is over."" Cohen is exploring how to do the marijuana version of various television genres such as talk shows, documentaries, cooking shows and music shows. One of those is a talk show with the Denver Post's Cannabist pot critic Jake Browne who gets high and hangs out with celebrity guests. Cohen is shopping a pilot where Jake parties with former Denver Bronco Nate Jackson who wrote a book about getting high in the NFL. Cohen thinks a program like this will attract celebrities. ""Marijuana is part of a brand. They're eager to be identified with it in the right way."" Cohen admits not every network is open to the idea of pot shows because there could be ad sales issues. Even so, there are more channels willing to listen to a marijuana pitch now than there were a year ago and the reaction is ""oooh that's sexy, maybe we'll get some viewers we don't normally get."" While he was in Washington D.C. at the non-fiction television summit, Realscreen, he went up to a women's network and asked if they were interested in talking and they said ""yes, definitely. Let's set up a call for next week.""   ""There are an awful lot of people who get high. My interest is in leading the charge. I don't want to follow the crowd. I want to do more. I feel like there are huge opportunities and we are getting out in front of some of them."" Cohen is looking at cable television and over the top networks and channels that are delivering programs through phone apps and streaming video on demand. ""At the same time there is a marijuana revolution there is a television implosion,"" he says. ""There are more and more media outlets and millennials are not paying for cable. You and I grew up in a world of half hour and hour television slots. Uh uh. Game over. Four minutes or eleven minutes or 71 minutes, it's whatever it is. People will find it if they want it and it speaks to them. The doors have blown off old media and everything is different going forward."" Cohen looks forward to returning to Colorado and cultivating his relationships with the Pot Barons. He describes his time in Denver as a ""dreamy busman's holiday."" In the meantime, he is casting for talent for new shows and producing a public service announcement for medical marijuana with a cast of 25 people with different conditions. He is also considering doing a documentary following the upcoming vote to legalize marijuana in California. ""This is exciting work for me. The kind of people who are drawn to the industry are positive, energetic, they're hard working like nobody's business, they're free thinking, they're open minded, they're creative. Six months ago I couldn't have done it and now I can and now I really want to.""For more information on Vicky Collins visit her website at Teletrends Television Production and Journalism.
