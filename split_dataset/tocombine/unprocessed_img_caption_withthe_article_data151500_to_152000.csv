""I didn’t want to just survive it. I wanted to grow from it. And I did learn a lot.""What, specifically, did Lopez learn?""Most importantly, to love myself first. As women, I don’t think we do that enough. We always love somebody else more than ourselves,"" she said. ""I did that for a long time and I couldn’t understand why things weren’t working. Then I realized that I wasn’t valuing myself in the way that I deserved.""She also alluded to what may be the real reason for the divorce.""You accept things that are less than what you want, and then you wonder why you find yourself in these situations. You think, 'I wouldn’t treat anyone in this way so why am I being treated like this?'""Lopez and Anthony, who have twins together, divorced in 2011 after seven years of marriage.

Hanging in her bathroom was a navy blue vinyl windbreaker, size 2XL, which Mom had ""borrowed"" from my stepdad years ago. He had a couple of them, so he didn't mind Mom wearing one of them. Every morning and every afternoon the two of them would walk around the block, holding hands to steady themselves, wearing their identical navy windbreakers. As Mom's Alzheimer's progressed, laundry didn't get done and their windbreakers became stained and worn -- a little smelly, too. Finally, I decided Mom needed a new windbreaker, a size M to better fit her 135-pound frame. I bought one, took it to her house on my next visit, and while she was napping, I threw her old one in the trash bin. When she awoke, she tried on the new jacket and seemed to like it. But the snap closures were too hard for her frail fingers and she had a hard time putting it on because it wasn't as loose and easy to slip into as the old 2XL had been. A couple weeks later, I discovered her new jacket folded neatly on the foot of her bed and a stained, worn 2XL was hanging on the hook where her old one had always hung. ""She couldn't have rescued it from the trash,"" I thought. ""The trash men came the very next morning and emptied the bins. Where could this identical old jacket have come from?""I looked in stepdad's closet and found that his old jacket was gone from its hook. Mom had apparently appropriated it and claimed it for her own. I stared at the stained, soiled thing and pondered whether to toss it. But then I remembered my friend Anita and her little, white, fluffy dog Tito.Years ago Anita bought a small stuffed toy monkey for Tito. He loved it. He played with it constantly -- tossing it around, chewing on it, carrying it with him everywhere, and demanding Anita throw it so he could fetch. After several years of heavy-duty play, the little monkey began to fall apart -- until nothing was left but a tangle of fabric infused with dog saliva and dirt. Totally gross.Anita bought several more dog toys, including a new monkey, but Tito would have none them. He loved his slimy old monkey -- that's all he wanted to play with. Anita humored him -- throwing the thing across the room again and again, so Tito could chase, fetch, and bring it back for her -- to repeat all over again. The mangled monkey became known as ""Slimy."" Whenever I'd visit, Tito would run to greet me and I'd say, ""Where's your Slimy? Bring me Slimy!"" He'd dash down the hall to fetch his beloved toy. We would play fetch until I got bored, then Tito would insist I play some more. My hand was soon covered in dog spittle... the price of having fun with an adorable dog, and somehow not so gross after all. And now, as I stood in my mother's bedroom staring at the purloined windbreaker, the situation became clear. Mom loves this old, stained, worn-out jacket -- three sizes too big and falling apart. ""Slimy,"" I think to myself, ""This jacket is my mother's Slimy."" And suddenly it didn't seem so ugly anymore.BJ Gallagher is the author of over two dozen books, including ""Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Other Women"" (Conari Press)For more by BJ Gallagher, click here.For more on Alzheimer's disease, click here.

2,PARENTING,The Downside for Dads,"Katherine Ullman, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/men-work-life-balance_us_5b9d45a8e4b03a1dcc862a00,"Let's remember that women can't ""lean in"" until men share the care, and men won't do this until workplaces adopt family-friendly policies and tackle the flexibility stigma that renders them impotent.",2013-06-19,A young boy working on his laptop with his father looking on in the background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d45a82500003300366500.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-written with Joan C. Williams.""My small contribution to feminism is leaving the office at 5:15 p.m. three times a week to pick up my daughter... and not hiding it."" You might expect that these are the words of a working mother who, after too little sleep and too many people wondering ""how she does it,"" decided to draw a line in the sand for all to see, with work firmly on one side and family on the other.But you'd be wrong -- we heard this from a young professional father. And who could blame you for your guess? With all of this recent hullabaloo about female breadwinners (elegantly complicated here and here ), it's easy to overlook the small ways in which working fathers' lives are changing, too -- or to even consider their evolving role in the work-life frontier at all.To put this young attorney's ""contribution"" in context, 5:15 p.m. is considered early in the day at most firms, his included. Half of young lawyers report working 50 hours a week or more. In the professional world in general, 40 percent of men report the same. That's a 10 hour work day, at minimum. But despite the expectation that men work grueling hours, fathers are spending more time during the week with their children than they did in the past, and millennial fathers are doing this today more than older fathers, suggesting a lasting change. With extreme expectations at work and a growing desire to be home, no wonder fathers report higher levels of work-life conflict than others. Let's dig further. Although one experimental study found that simply being a father actually helps men's careers, another study found that when fathers let family interfere with work, they suffer even greater work penalties than their female counterparts. And nothing reveals a father's family responsibilities more than leaving the office early, taking advantage of flexible work arrangements, or using family leave.In a new special issue of the Journal of Social Issues, co-edited by Joan, the co-author of this post, and colleagues Jennifer Glass, Shelley Correll, and Jennifer L. Berdahl, several studies explore exactly why men experience such stigma when using family-friendly policies. One study found that men and women are equally likely to want a flexible schedule but men were much less likely to plan to request one. Many men feared that asking for a flexible schedule would make them seem more feminine. And those who actually did ask for it were likely to ask for less than they really wanted.A second study sheds light on what's at stake for these men. Participants in the study were asked to rate men and women who took family leaves and those who did not. If the employee was a man who took time off, he was less likely than other men to be recommended for promotions, raises or high-profile assignments. Why? These men were seen to have traditionally feminine traits, which in turn, made them seem like bad workers. The flexibility stigma, in other words, is a femininity stigma.It makes perfect sense, then, that a separate study found that men in male-dominated workplaces who did more child-care received more ""masculinity harassment"" (disparaging remarks about one's masculinity) than other employees. So where does this leave fathers? Let's go back to our young attorney. He explained to us that by intentionally talking to colleagues about leaving early, he hoped break down the stigma surrounding family responsibilities; this, he hoped, would benefit both men and women at his firm and, by extension, their partners. Still, as the current breadwinner of his family, he's only willing to take this so far: ""I am fine with leaving at 5:15 three days a week, but am I willing to risk my job by trying to be the first male at my firm to work part-time in order to be at home with my kids? Maybe not.""This young man is an exceptional guy, we'll grant you, but if even he is scared to use a part-time policy, there's little hope of many other fathers making the changes they want for themselves and their family.In continued celebration of Father's Day, let's remember that women can't ""lean in"" until men share the care, and men won't do this until workplaces adopt family-friendly policies and tackle the flexibility stigma that renders them impotent."

5,FOOD & DRINK,The Magic That Molecular Gastronomists Don't Discuss,"Zester Daily, Contributor
Zester Daily: The culture of food and drink.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-magic-that-molecular_us_5b9d4278e4b03a1dcc8606fc,Discovering the science behind magical concoctions.,2013-06-18,2013-06-14-MolecularGastronomy.Credit.SusanLutz.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-06-14-MolecularGastronomy.Credit.SusanLutz.jpg,"By Susan Lutz  I've never really understood the lure of molecular gastronomy. I'll admit that the science behind it is fascinating, but as food it just never rocked my world. While dining on cotton candy foie gras at a restaurant known for molecular gastronomy, I ordered an Old-Fashioned. By the time I'd swallowed the chemically engineered ""cherry"" at the bottom of the drink, I'd had a brainstorm. This experience would be a lot more fun if the chef would simply sit beside me and explain why the seemingly solid maraschino cherry magically disappeared in my mouth. In fact, I wanted to know everything about the scientific principals that made crazy concoctions like this possible.Unfortunately I'd never found a way to make this happen. That is, until I attended the 2nd Annual Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream Social at LA Makerspace in Los Angeles. It was really less of an ice cream social and more of a molecular gastronomy magic show. This event answered my question about the maraschino cherry, plus a few I'd never thought to ask.Related: Getting to know the reality of how elBulli operated.The mastermind behind the event was Ariel Levi Simons. He's a passionate amateur molecular gastronomist, as well as a physics teacher at Wildwood School in West Los Angeles and a founding member of LA Makerspace. In front of a group of about 50 people, Simons created culinary illusions, while simultaneously explaining the science behind the magic. Families with small children helped him freeze ice cream in less than 30 seconds under a cloud of bubbling liquid nitrogen. Grown-up science geeks mulled the question of which tasted better, carbonated pineapple or fizzy habañero-infused avocado.I was most excited to learn about spherification, the process by which my faux-maraschino cherry was created. Simons enthusiastically described a magical elixir that could turn almost any liquid into a sphere. It's all thanks to sodium alginate, a common food additive derived from kelp that many of us eat every day. It's used to prevent freezer burn in ice cream and thicken McDonald's apple pies. Simons makes a slightly more upscale concoction: synthetic caviar.Simons loads equal amounts of a concentrated syrup, such as Torani, and sodium alginate into a syringe. Then he squeezes small drops of the mixture into a solution of food-grade calcium chloride. When the two solutions meet, the calcium ions bind to the sodium alginate, forming a skin around the liquid that magically transforms into a sphere within a few seconds. Related: Check out Simons's technique using syringe with Torani syrup and sodium alginate.It's pure physics and chemistry. When you bite into these tiny spheres, the thin skin immediately bursts, unleashing the taste of tangerine or black tea inside. It's not quite caviar, but the mystery of the faux-maraschino was solved.The greater mystery of the event turned out to be Simons himself. I was surprised to learn that Simons' interest in food chemistry runs deeper than the simple parlor tricks of molecular gastronomy, which he describes as ""the showiest and quickest"" way to talk about food chemistry.Simons is passionate about traditional methods of food preservation, as I am, and we discussed real magic: the slow but startling fermentation of kimchi, the alchemy of 1,000-year-old eggs, and the mysterious transformation of black garlic. Simons is fascinated with the chemistry of even the most basic foods. He revealed the fact that corn syrup is far more chemically complex than anything he made at the ice cream social. In fact, the production of corn syrup is so complex that it is only economically feasible because the United States government subsidizes the production of corn, which makes it almost free as a raw product.Simons thinks the complexity of our food actually may be a problem, especially because no one realizes how ubiquitous it is. ""Food production has been a driving force in human history,"" he said. And sadly, this driving force has largely been forgotten.""We don't think about food production because we don't have to,"" he said. ""We've sort of won the game.""Related: TV shows the laboratory behind the kitchen.But Simons recognizes that there are good reasons to understand where our food comes from and how it's made. The point of Simons' ""magic show"" at the ice cream social was to ""show that it's not actually magic. It's a technique we developed to take food and transport it and sell it across the world.""For me, the real thrill of molecular gastronomy is discovering the science behind the seemingly magical concoctions that I eat. I've tried my own food alchemy demonstrations with my kids, including making my own sugar from sugarcane. And when I next have the opportunity to taste potato foam gnocchi or dried olive soil, I won't need the chef sitting next to me to fully enjoy the experience.But frankly, my favorite form of molecular gastronomy involves the chemical reaction between a large bag of salt and the back leg of a pig. Country ham -- now that's magic.Photos, from top:Molecular gastronomy in action. Credit: Susan LutzAriel Levi Simons shares a bowl of liquid nitrogen ice cream.

(PHOTOS)",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crumble-cobbler_us_5b9d448fe4b03a1dcc861d95,"Or a grunt, slump, buckle or brown Betty? We'll help you decode!",2013-06-18,"Apple and blackberry brown betty in white bowl on table, close-up",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d448f2000003000fde678.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There seems to be some confusion over our baked goods, everyone. Tell the truth: if we asked you to tell us the difference between a crumble, cobbler, crisp, grunt, slump, buckle or brown Betty (without Googling it), could you tell us? Until we started working on this article, we definitely wouldn't have been able to swing it. All of these desserts have some common element. Nearly every one involves fruit, butter, sugar and flour in one way or another. The differences are definitely fewer than the similarities, but it's fun to learn new things, especially when those new things are about delicious desserts. Ready? Here we go. Crumble  A crumble is probably what you think of when you hear any of the names of the other desserts in this list. A crumble is a baked dish of fresh fruit (apples, berries, plums, etc.) that is topped with an oat-based streusel. (Though oats don't always make it into this dessert). Add ice cream and transport to summer heaven.Crisp  A crisp is exactly like a crumble -- some say crisps never have oats, some say they do. In other words, they're a lot like crumbles. Cobbler  If anyone ever serves you a ""cobbler"" that is topped with pie crust, they are pulling your leg. Or... trying to get you to eat pie. A true cobbler is topped with individually-dropped biscuits. When the dish bakes and the biscuits puff up, they look like a cobblestone street, hence the name cobbler. (We had a major lightbulb moment when we figured this out -- how did we never know that before?)Buckle  A buckle layers a more traditional, cakey batter underneath the fruit. As the dessert cooks, the cake rises around the fruit, which tries its best to sink to the bottom, making the whole thing buckle inwards.Grunt/Slump  Great news! A grunt and a slump are exactly the same thing. Grunts and slumps are just like cobblers, only instead of being baked in the oven, they are cooked covered, entirely on the stove-top (or camping fire, or whatever). This steams the biscuits on top of the fruit, rather than bakes them. This dish earned the name ""grunt"" because that's the noise that the hot, bubbly fruit makes as it ""grunts"" up around the biscuit dough. This dished earned its other name, ""slump,"" because that is what it does when you try to put it on a plate.Brown Betty  A brown Betty uses the same kinds of crumbs as a crisp (sweet, buttery, no oats), but there is a layer under the fruit as well as on top of the fruit. Buttery crumb lovers, the brown Betty is your dessert. Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "
