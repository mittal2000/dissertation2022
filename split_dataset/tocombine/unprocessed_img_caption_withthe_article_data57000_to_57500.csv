He was on bike patrol with fellow Baltimore Police officers Garrett Miller and Lt. Brian Rice, working the 1700 block of North Avenue on April 12, 2015. The Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office had told the officers to patrol the “high-crime area” located in the city’s Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood to address citizen complaints of open-air drug dealing.When the officers made eye contact with 25-year-old Freddie Gray, he took off running. After a short foot chase, the officers caught Gray, arrested him and placed him in the back of a police van without a seatbelt. He sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in the van and died a week later.Thursday was the first day of trial proceedings for Nero, the second of six officers indicted in Gray’s death -- and it was dominated by discussion of whether Gray should have been buckled up, and what discretion officers have on following the department’s policy for buckling up suspects.During opening statements, Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow maintained that Nero’s failure to buckle Gray’s seatbelt when he helped place Gray in the van makes him partially responsible for Gray’s death.""The issue here is not one of danger, it's an issue of caring,"" Schatzow said. ""Mr. Gray was put in a risky and dangerous position on the floor of that van.""But Marc Zayon, the head of Nero’s defense, claimed it wasn’t safe for his client to buckle Gray into the van because Gray was resisting arrest. He noted that Gray had to be dragged to the police wagon and, once he was inside, began violently shaking and moving the wagon.“There are times when it is impossible to seat-belt,” Zayon said during the defense’s opening statements. “This is one of those times.” It’s no question that not being secured into the police van caused Gray to sustain spinal cord injuries similar to those of high-speed crash victims. There is also no dispute that securing suspects was department protocol.On April 9, 2015, officers were notified via email of an amendment to the department’s seat belt policy. Though the defense claims Nero was off-duty at the time the email was sent, a field training coordinator testified that all officers are instructed to read their emails daily for communication. The amendment states that there are “no exceptions to the requirement that officers seatbelt anyone that traveled in [a] patrol vehicle,” Schatzow said. And, even if there was an officer-safety exception, Nero had “no reason to suspect his safety was in danger,” Schatzow claimed. Gray was not frisked at the time of his arrest and Nero was sent to retrieve Miller’s bike, leaving Miller alone with Gray. This demonstrated, Schatzow argued, that there was no articulable suspicion that Gray was dangerous, and the safety exception -- if there were one -- would not apply.But Zayon claimed the back of the van was too small for Nero to buckle Gray without putting his safety at risk. A suspect could even “spit,” “headbutt” or “throw a shoulder” -- and the small area wouldn't have given the officer enough space to safely move out of the way, Zayon said.“There is always discretion for officer safety,” he said.Cpt. Martin Bartness, the prosecution’s first witness, inadvertently agreed. Though the current chief of staff for Commissioner Kevin Davis identified the amendment a “best practice,” Zayon challenged Bartness on the credibility of the term, in what quickly evolved into a philosophical exploration of police protocol.“I think there are a number of practices that are subject to debate,” Bartness responded stoically before explaining that officers make discretionary decisions every day. Zayon inquired whether discretion was still present based on the nature of the job, even though the new policy removed the word. He asked Bartness to consider an officer who witnessed an armed robbery while filling out routine paperwork. He then questioned whether the hypothetical officer was required to finish his assignment or if he had the ""discretion"" to stop and chase down the fleeing suspect.Bartness said he hoped the officer would respond to the emergency.“Because he has the discretion to act for the greater good of the public?” Zayon asked.“Yes,” Bartness replied."

Terry McAuliffe (D) is making it easier for young people to enter the workforce immediately after high school, in an effort to modernize the state's approach to education and employment.McAuliffe signed legislation on Thursday that will change high school graduation requirements so that students who aren't headed to college can better prepare for the working world. The changes will go into effect for students starting high school in the fall of 2018.The late state Sen. John C. Miller (D), who sponsored the legislation, had envisioned that high school students would have a choice in their junior and senior years. Either they could go down a track that would lead to post-secondary education, or they could work toward earning credit for internships, apprenticeships or industry certification.“Rather than sitting in an algebra 3 class where they can’t see any relevance to what they want to do in the future, they will be able to take courses that best prepare them for their career choice,” Miller said in February.“Our high schools don’t work the way they should any more. They were built for the Industrial Revolution,” McAuliffe said Thursday. “We now live in a 21st-century economy. Our students deserve much better and I know that our high schools can do so much more than they’ve done.”The governor's plans to redesign the state's education system aren't limited to Virginia's high schools. McAuliffe has also announced his intention to add $1 billion overall to the state budget for K-12 education and higher education."
3,BUSINESS,One Map That Shows How The Middle Class Is Getting Squeezed,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-middle-class-squeezed_us_5734ea76e4b060aa7819c3c6,People just aren't earning as much as they used to.,2016-05-13,The middle-class share fell in almost all U.S. metropolitan areas from 2000 to 2014,http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2016/05/ST_2016.05.12_middle-class-geo-app-17.png,"In America, everyone likes to think of themselves as middle-class. But the portion of the population that can actually make that claim based on their income is getting smaller. Pew Research released a report this week looking at data from the 2014 American Community Survey. It found a ton of troubling information about America's withering middle class. Of particular concern: Incomes are shrinking everywhere from New England to the Southwest. In 2000, 55 percent of American adults belonged to a household with a middle-class income (defined as any amount between two-thirds and twice the national median income -- so about $41,641 to $124,924 for a three-person household). By 2014, that share had shrunk to 51 percent, according to Pew. And in the vast majority of American cities, people are becoming worse off.This map illustrates just how badly the middle class is hurting in the U.S. It shows the share of adults living in middle-class households in 229 different metropolitan areas. Gray spots show where the share of middle-class people grew smaller between 2000 and 2014. Yellow spots show where the share of middle-class people got larger. As you can see, there's barely any yellow on the map.It's true that in some places, the share of middle-class people went down because people are earning more money, not less. ""A shrinking of the middle class may signal a movement into either the lower-income tier or the upper-income tier,"" the report notes. Moreover, ""the shifting economic fortunes of localities were not an either/or proposition: Some 108 metropolitan areas experienced growth in both the lower- and upper-income tiers.""But the overall picture is cause for worry, not celebration. Per Pew:The widespread erosion of the middle class took place against the backdrop of a decrease in household incomes in most U.S. metropolitan areas. Nationwide, the median income of U.S. households in 2014 stood at 8% less than in 1999, a reminder that the economy has yet to fully recover from the effects of the Great Recession of 2007-09. The decline was pervasive, with median incomes falling in 190 of 229 metropolitan areas examined.How do you stack up in this? Are you middle-class? Take Pew's income survey to find out."

Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) made fun of Republicans on Friday for being ""obsessed"" with where transgender people go to the bathroom, delivering a speech on the House floor that fell somewhere between a comedy skit and a biting policy attack.""I rise today to address the great American bathroom controversy,"" began Grayson, who is currently running for Senate.He stood next to a poster of actress Christine Jorgensen, the first widely known transsexual woman in the country. Grayson imagined a scenario where Jorgensen had to use a public restroom today in North Carolina -- where Gov. Pat McCrory (R) in March signed a law barring transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity.""You’re going to force people who look like men, act like men -- you're going to force them into a ladies room?"" Grayson asked, propping up another picture of two women standing in front of urinals, looking annoyed. ""You folks in North Carolina who are obsessed with where the transgendered go to the bathroom, this is the result you've come up with?""The Florida congressman offered a few choice words about his feelings on the North Carolina law -- ""stupid,"" ""bad,"" ""ridiculous"" -- and wondered aloud how the Republican Party can claim to be the party of small government when it's focused on regulating transgender people's bathroom habits.""It turns out the party of small government wants a government small enough to fit underneath the toilet seat,"" Grayson said, adding that if people really want to tackle gender issues, they should do something about the fact that women in the U.S. still make 79 cents for every dollar that a man makes.Watch Grayson's full, animated speech below. He dropped the word ""cisgender"" -- possibly a first on the House floor -- and propped up another poster of a cartoon boy and girl looking into their underwear and declaring, ""Oh!

With his primary opponents dispatched and establishment Republicans being wooed in earnest, Donald Trump believes himself to be on the glide path to unifying the Republican Party. But not so fast: the rebel movement of distressed and despairing Republicans who have emerged under the hashtag-cum-banner #NeverTrump has not given up the fight to keep the ranting rawhide chew from reaching the Oval Office. This week, Republican consultant Liz Mair, who's been an outspoken leader of the Never Trumpers, joins the podcast to tell us what they plan to do.In a piece over at The Federalist, Mair outlines four possible avenues to keep Trump from winning the presidency. The simplest strategy, she tells us, is to help promote the candidacy of likely Libertarian Party candidate and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, as he provides a easy out for conservatives who would prefer to not vote for likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.From there, plans get dicier. The Never Trump movement could keep working on convincing convention delegates to blow up the rules. Or, it could convince well-known Republican candidates to run on the ballot in favorable states, in an effort to deny Trump the electoral votes.Or, it can form a new political party entirely. Which is, well, not the lightest of lifts. Nevertheless, it's a testament to how much these people despise Trump that this is one of the ideas that remains up for consideration.It's clear that #NeverTrump isn't ready to throw in the towel just yet. The question is, how far is this movement willing to go, and are they ready to pay the consequences that their attempts at upheaval are certain to bring?Elsewhere on this week’s podcast: North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch are taking to the courts to litigate the bizarre bathroom bill that McCrory signed in the hopes of antagonizing trans residents of the Tar Heel state. In addition, we talk to Roger Lowenstein about his new book, America's Bank: The Epic Struggle To Create The Federal Reserve.“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week: author Roger Lowenstein, Republican consultant and anti-Trump organizer Liz Mair, as well as Huffington Post reporters Laura Barron-Lopez and Dana Liebelson.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

6,POLITICS,"House Republicans Don't Like Trump, But That Won't Stop Them From Voting For Him",Matt Fuller and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-republicans-donald-trump-positions_us_5736026ee4b08f96c1830186,How do you support a man who takes positions opposite to your own? Practice. Practice. Practice.,2016-05-13,Republican voters love the party's presumptive presidential nominee. Now most House Republicans are swallowing their reservations and getting on the #TrumpTrain.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5736046022000057072568c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Speaker Paul Ryan isn’t the only House Republican doing some soul-searching on Donald Trump.Republicans are learning that squaring their positions on issues like debt, Social Security and Medicare with those of the presumptive GOP nominee requires some contortions more complicated than Trump’s combover.But the key to supporting a nominee whose positions -- depending on the day and the issue, of course -- seem so antithetical to the GOP's is this: you focus on the alternative.“He’s 10 times better than Hillary,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told The Huffington Post.Massie, who’s actually a delegate at the GOP nominating convention in July, said none of the people on the “Never Trump” bandwagon are proposing an alternative. “So I’m presuming they’re for Hillary,” he said.Asked how he could support Trump, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) launched into an explanation that began: “Here’s what I know about the likely Democrat nominee.”Pressed multiple times about the likely Republican nominee, Jordan returned time and again to Benghazi and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s stories about the attack.Ask about Trump, you get an answer about Clinton.Even when you get into the policy differences between Trump and Republicans in general, members basically reconciled those contradictions by saying they either weren’t familiar enough with Trump’s statements, that 'at least he's better than Hillary' or that Trump will change.“He’ll learn,” said Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), who was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump. “He’ll put good people around him.”Meaning he’ll just change his position?“He’ll learn and he’ll grow,” DesJarlais answered.DesJarlais might be right, too. After Trump breathlessly promised voters during the primary that he didn’t want to touch Social Security, his chief policy adviser, Sam Clovis, said recently that Trump would “take a look at all of the programs, including entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.""Trump may have foreshadowed this bait-and-switch approach in 2011, when he suggested that he accepted the need for cuts, but said it was a losing political strategy for Republicans to make the first move.“Things have to be done, but it has to be done with both parties together,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “You can’t have the Republicans get too far ahead of this issue.”Plenty of Republicans think Trump is destined to go back on his word. “He has to change his mind,” Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said, adding, “I think we all change every second, along with the famous Greek philosopher Heraclitus.”“Social Security and Medicare are both insolvent in 2034, so if you don’t want to touch them, they’ll be insolvent,” Brat said.It’s true Social Security faces a funding gap in 2034. If Congress does nothing to shore up its finances, the program would suffer an across-the-board benefit cut of more than 20 percent. Many progressives back plans to partially or entirely close the gap through revenue increases; conservatives prefer solutions centered on benefit cuts; others favor some combination of both.But Trump was clear in December he didn’t want to touch either program.“We’re not gonna cut your Social Security and we’re not cutting your Medicare,” he said.Trump has insisted that economic growth and cutting waste, fraud and abuse in the system would solve entitlement spending issues. He neglects to mention that the incidence of incorrect overpayments is typically under 1 percent, according to the Social Security Administration’s estimates. (Combined administrative costs for both the retirement and disability programs are also under 1 percent.)But, miraculously, Republicans don’t think Trump is that far from them on these issues.House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), whose committee has jurisdiction over the program, downplayed their differences.“I haven’t had a chance to visit with Mr. Trump about the issues,” Brady said, “but I’ll bet you, like us, he wants to save Social Security for the long term.”House Republicans have enthusiastically voted for plans -- most of them authored by then-budget chairman and now-Speaker Paul Ryan -- to slash Medicare and Social Security. Other plans kicking around Congress have the government raising the retirement age to 70.“Those are conversations that will have to take place eventually,” Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said, “because the math doesn’t lie, man, math doesn’t lie.”Diaz-Balart added that entitlements were an area where Trump's statements are similar to Clinton's. “And again, the math doesn’t bear that out,” Diaz-Balart said.Republicans have obvious difficulty embracing Trump. Many of the ones HuffPost talked to refused to use the presumptive nominee’s name. Some others weren’t ready to commit to voting for “the nominee” in November.Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) said he was “still a Ted Cruz fan,” noting that, with Trump, “what he said one minute might be different the next five minutes.” Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) said he, like many other members, had a lot of questions that needed to be answered before he could support Trump. And Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), when asked if he could ever hop aboard the #TrumpTrain, made it clear he has no intention of folding on his principles.“It’s very different from my message, and I’m not jumping onboard,” said Amash, who recently summed up Trump's debt position on Twitter with the poop emoji. Other Republicans struggle to justify backing the man who'll be at the top of the ticket.When asked how he could back someone whose answer to the growing debt is to just print more money, fiscal hawk Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said he wouldn't talk about the presidential race between now and election day, noting that his “public position” is he’ll vote for all the Republicans on the ballot.Pressed on Trump’s comments about debt, Brooks cracked, “Hey, he’s got expertise in bankruptcy!”“Oh my goodness, you drew one out of me,” Brooks continued, feigning surprise.Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), who noted that he opposed Trump “pretty mightily” during the primary, said much of it comes down to Supreme Court appointments. “With Trump, I have at least some hope that he’s going to make the right choice,” Labrador said.Asked about the reality TV star's foreign policy, Labrador claimed Trump wasn’t bad on that topic. But presented with some of Trump’s past comments on national security -- including bombing ISIS, torturing people and giving a nuclear weapon to Japan -- Labrador conceded, “There are some things he doesn’t quite understand.”Republicans agree that Trump’s comment are crazy. It’s just not going to stop them from supporting him.“Yeah, I mean, they are worrisome,” said Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.)Asked whether Trump was a safe person to have in the White House, Stutzman said: “I—I don’t know. I don’t know the answer to that question.”And isn’t that scary?“Yeah, it is. It is. But, you know, I’m willing to give him a shot,” Stutzman continued. “I know Hillary, and I’m not going to support Hillary. So this is where we’re at.”Stutzman took a long pause. He shook his head.“I don’t know. It’s crazy,"" he said. ""It’s a crazy political world we’re in right now.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
7,POLITICS,Texas Lt. Gov. Would Forfeit Billions Over Anti-Trans Discrimination. Here's What That Means For Schools.,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-dan-patrick-federal-funds_us_573614c8e4b060aa781a3901,The Lone Star State's second in command would rather eliminate federal funds for poor students than comply with Title IX regulations.,2016-05-13,"Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says Texas won't ""yield to blackmail from the president of the United States"" and let trans students use the bathroom of their choice.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5736289a220000570725690e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said Friday his state would give up all federal education funding in order to avoid complying with the gender equity law Title IX in how trans students are treated.The result of forfeiting the $10 billion currently flowing from the U.S. government to schools and public universities in Texas could leave thousands of college students without a way to pay tuition, grind to a halt a majority of research taking place on the campuses, and leave low-income children without support for meals. ""[President Barack Obama] says he's going to withhold funding if schools do not follow the policy,"" Patrick said Friday at a press conference. ""Well, in Texas, he can keep his 30 pieces of silver. We will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States.""The Obama administration on Friday released significant guidance reinforcing that the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice interpret Title IX to prohibit discrimination against transgender students. This means, the guidance said, that schools must allow trans student to use the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity, and universities should do the same when it comes to sex-segregated campus housing.Other Republican state officials, including Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, have also condemned the Obama administration's directive, calling on school districts to disregard the guidance.""If we have to fight this order, we will not hesitate to do so,"" Herbert said in a Friday statement.Schools that do not follow Title IX, and refuse to correct policies found in violation of the statute, could lose all federal funding from any U.S. government agency. ""We will not sell out our children to the federal government,"" Patrick said. ""And the people of Texas and the legislature will find a way to find as much of that money as we can if we are forced to. There is no compromise on this issue.""Texas K-12 schools receive $5 billion a year in federal funding, a third going toward providing meals for impoverished students, and a fifth of it for supporting students with disabilities. Patrick said he instructed superintendents not to adopt policies allowing trans students to use the single-sex facilities that match their gender identity, and insisted that ""most"" superintendents would not want to follow such a policy. Patrick largely avoided mentioning higher education during his remarks, which would take a huge hit without federal dollars. The University of Texas system gets $1.6 billion from the federal government, much of that supporting research done at its campuses. Another $37 million in federal dollars goes toward the Texas A&M University system.Half of all research done within the UT system comes from the federal government, as do half of all scholarships and financial aid for students who need help paying for college. State funds in both cases only account for about one-quarter of the revenue. Texas Tech University gets $61.6 million from federal programs, accounting for 15 times more than what it gets from the state. Spokesmen for the UT system and Texas Tech told HuffPost on Friday that they were not ready to comment about the issue. Officials from other universities did not immediately provide a response. Public higher education in Texas has increasingly become reliant on federal revenue as the state has trimmed appropriations, according to the Texas comptroller office. Experts widely believe most public colleges could not survive without federal funding.The consequences of losing access to federal funds could prove devastating to college students who are reliant on loans and other financial aid from the U.S. government. A majority of students at many of Texas' public colleges, like UT-Austin, UT-Arlington, Texas Tech University, Texas A&M-Corpus Cristi and Texas Southern University, to name a few, graduate with student loan debt, according to the Institute for College Access & Success. At other schools like the University of Houston and Texas A&M-College Station, about 48 percent of graduates leave with student debt. About 90 percent of that student loan debt is owed to the U.S. Education Department. The Justice Department sued the state of North Carolina and the University of North Carolina system this week over a law, H.B. 2, that bars trans students from using the bathroom or locker room matching their gender identity -- after the state first sued the DOJ to avoid penalty for violating federal civil rights laws. Unlike Texas, officials in North Carolina have not signaled they would be able to stand to lose federal education funding. The White House mocked Patrick at a daily press briefing with reporters Friday over his side-gig hosting a radio show.

""I am hopeful the NHL will come to recognize the harmful effects of its past mistreatment of head injuries and protect its current and future players from the same fate.""""I am hopeful Congress will turn the attention they have shown other sports leagues on this issue toward the NHL and ensure that the league is taking the steps necessary to limit brain injuries to the fullest extent possible,"" Christian's statement continued.Christian, a part of the gold medal-winning U.S. hockey team at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics, played in parts of 16 seasons in the NHL for the Winnipeg Jets, Washington Capitals, Boston Bruins, St. Louis Blues and Chicago Blackhawks. He is currently one of more than 100 former NHL players suing the league over its treatment of concussions. The suit is similar to the one filed -- and recently settled -- by more than 4,500 former NFL players against their league.Friday's hearing in the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is focused on the effects of concussions in youth sports, a worthwhile cause given the litany of unanswered questions about the risks of concussions and repeated hits to the head of young athletes.Kevin Margarucci, the manager of player safety for USA Hockey, the sport's American governing body, is scheduled to testify.But while this committee and others have held numerous hearings regarding concussions and their effects in football and the NFL -- including one in March at which an NFL representative acknowledged a link between the sport and the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE -- it has not yet examined the NHL's current or past management of concussions.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has claimed there is ""no evidence yet"" to link CTE and concussions suffered by NHL players. Asked about the potential connection after the NFL's admission in March, Bettman said only that ""it’s fairly clear that playing hockey isn’t the same as football.""""And as we’ve said all along,"" Bettman continued, ""we’re not going to get into a public debate on this.”The NHL filed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the lawsuit from former players in March, and the case is currently in the discovery process, during which the league has turned over more than 2 million documents to players' attorneys. Bettman has said the league has no desire to settle the suit, as the NFL did.“They’re in denial. They don’t want to have to get out their wallets,” Rudy Poeschek, a former NHL defenseman who is also suing the league, told HuffPost last year. “Once you’re done with them, they don’t care about a player like me. Unless you’re a superstar in the league, they don’t care about you when you’re done.”"

The Grammy-winning singer has been doing that since getting her musical start in the 1960s. But now LaBelle is using her voice in a new way: to speak out about lung cancer. “My two sisters died in their early 40s of lung cancer,” LaBelle told The Huffington Post about her siblings Vivian and Jackie. “There was no cure for it and within a year of being diagnosed they both died ... I would come back from touring and I would see them going through changes and diminishing. I couldn’t do anything about it then because I didn’t know much about what was going on."" LaBelle's choir director, whom she says ""gave me my voice,"" also died of lung cancer.""Now, as 71-year-old lady, I decided to put my voice into action,"" LaBelle said. She's partnering with Lung Force, a national movement led by the American Lung Association to unite women against lung cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer of women. According to the American Lung Association, an estimated 72,000 American women will lose their lives to lung cancer in 2016 alone -- more than a quarter of all female cancer deaths.LaBelle hopes she can do something about that -- by helping to raise awareness, as well as funds, for cancer research. While chatting with LaBelle during National Women’s Lung Health Week, HuffPost also also caught up with the singer about new music, Prince and more: How she stays healthy: ""I try to eat great foods and I do cook for myself a lot. And I do exercise as much as I can, and I realize that my body is a temple and I have to treat it like that.""On her 1974 landmark hit “Lady Marmalade”: ""It was a song that we had gotten from Bob Crewe 40 years ago. When we heard the song we knew it was a hit so we took it to the late Allen Toussaint in New Orleans, and that was the first song we recorded for that project. And it was all over -- everywhere.""On her upcoming music: ""I have a new album, that’s been done, that should come out before the year is out. It’s sort of a jazz album with songs by Nina Simone and older artists from back in the day.""On recording music with late singer Prince: ""I went to his studio and he treated me like a queen. He drove me around and he just took care of me, like a son. Just a really nice person -- such a great talent. And we’re gonna miss him.""On her success: ""I owe my success to God! I don’t take anything for granted. I know there are so many women who can sing much better than I can but I’ve never taken it for granted. And my feet are planted on the ground. I thank the people who have gotten to know me and who buy my music -- I appreciate that so much. But I know that I can be replaced."""
13,SPORTS,E-Sports Organizations Are Going To Launch Governing Body For Pro Video Gaming,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/esports-governing-body-world-esports-association_us_5734fcfbe4b08f96c182b7b0,Think of it as a FIFA for e-sports.,2016-05-13,"Thousands of fans watch an e-sports competition in Cologne, Germany, in 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5734ff7822000042072567b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The world of competitive video gaming may be about to grow up in a major way.At a Friday press conference in London, the Electronic Sports League, the largest organization inside the rapidly growing world of competitive video gaming, along with eight of the industry’s most prominent European teams, will announce the formation of the World Esports Association, one of the first efforts to create an international governing body for competitive gaming.Think of WESA almost as a “FIFA for e-sports” -- an organization that could set standards; help bring consistency and regulation to competitions; create rules for player contracts, compensation and movement between teams; and otherwise organize the broader world of e-sports. At least that’s the aim.“WESA is an open and inclusive organization that will further professionalize esports by introducing elements of player representation, standardized regulations, and revenue sharing for teams,” the organization said in a press release. “WESA will seek to create predictable schedules for fans, players, organizers and broadcasters, and for the first time bring all stakeholders to the discussion table.”“It’s nothing new,” Pietro Fringuelli, who will serve as WESA’s interim commissioner as it launches, told The Huffington Post. “At the end of the day, what we have tried to do is to do exactly what the other [sports] have done -- to find an organization that covers the whole industry.”Over the past two decades, e-sports have blossomed from a small phenomenon into a major video gaming market, with a total market size of more than $400 million in 2016. That figure, according to European market analysis firm NewZoo, is expected to grow to more than $1 billion by the end of the decade as investment from around the world continues to pour in.Based around some of the most popular video games in the world -- titles like League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2 -- the industry has amassed millions of competitors and followers worldwide. More than 200 million people either competed in or watched e-sports tournaments in 2014, according to NewZoo, and that same year, the League of Legends World Championship drew 40,000 fans in Seoul and 27 million viewers on online platforms across the world. The industry's growth has led to efforts to bring standards to competitive gaming, of which WESA is the latest. The Swiss-based organization is a project of the ESL, a league that now boasts more than 6 million members worldwide and eight of the top European teams in the industry -- Fnatic, Natus Vincere, EnVyUs, Virtus.Pro, Gamers2, Faze, mousesports and Ninjas in Pyjamas.WESA has grown “out of years of experience, and different experiences,” Wouter Sleijffers, the CEO of Fnatic, told HuffPost. “Certain things have grown out of a natural evolution of e-sports. There were instances where you would say, 'Wouldn't it just be better if we put more of a framework toward it?’”“Now we're importing a more formal structure for the association,” Sleijffers said.Investors and broadcast companies interested in tapping into the thriving market have already begun to move into the industry -- ESPN and Turner now broadcast e-sports events in the United States -- and in theory, an overarching organization that sets guidelines and standards within competitive gaming will make the industry more professional and an even more attractive option for new sponsors and investors, Fringuelli said.A leak of WESA documents on Reddit and other forums earlier this week drew largely negative reactions from many in the gaming community, in part because the organization will revolve around just one league for one game -- the ESL Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Pro League  -- and eight teams, all based in Europe, for the time being. That led to concerns that top teams in North America, Africa, and particularly Asia, where the industry traces its deepest roots, would be excluded, as might teams and players participating in other popular games.But WESA’s founders say they are following the model laid out by other organizations -- like FIFA, or major American and European leagues -- that started small and grew into the titans of their sports. If the organization takes root, it could expand to other leagues, games and teams, they said. And WESA’s current teams and players, the backers said, will be allowed to participate in competitions and other games outside of WESA.That small start, they insist, is necessary to form the type of body that can take the growth of e-sports into its next phase.“Every league worldwide has always started with seven, eight, ten teams. You can't bring every team in the first step to the table, because then the discussions will never end,” Fringuelli said. “We think once we find a fantastic compromise for all of these regulations with these guys, then of course we'll fit for the whole industry.”For now, fans of competitive gaming likely won’t notice changes brought by the organization, Fringuelli said. But players and teams will.The most immediate benefit of WESA, in fact, may be for players -- at least those on the eight teams involved. The organization will set up a Players Council, made up of a player representative from each of the eight teams, that will have a say in all of the league’s policies, including on standard contracts, revenue sharing and player transfers between teams.That “will enable all of us to get a real say in decisions that directly influence us,” Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas, a player on Team Virtus.Pro, said in WESA’s release. “With a Player Council sitting at the table with the rest of the decision makers, we’re going to continue [to] improve the tournament and league organization.”Other organizations and video game companies have attempted to bring similar structure to e-sports in the past, but with its level of player and team involvement, WESA is hoping its efforts help launch a new era of professionalized gaming.“The proof is in the pudding,” Sleijffers, the Fnatic CEO, said. “Right now what we've created is something on paper. The next stage is to make sure we live up to our ambition.”"

Martin's family has said the 17-year-old was simply walking home after buying a drink and candy from a local store when he had his fatal encounter with Zimmerman.Martin's killing near Orlando, Florida, sparked nationwide civil rights protests and debate over ""stand your ground"" laws, which let people use deadly force without a duty to retreat if they are in fear of being harmed. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the case.By lunchtime on Friday, bidders in the auction on the United Gun Group's website included ""shaniqua bonifa"" and ""Tamir Rice,"" the same name as the 12-year-old black boy shot dead by a white police officer in Cleveland in 2014.The auction is scheduled to end on Wednesday. USA Today reported that the bid by ""Racist McShootFace"" was later deleted.The auction began on Thursday after the first site where Zimmerman attempted to sell the gun rejected the listing. That site, GunBroker.com, said in a statement that it wanted no part in the auction or the attendant publicity. 'LETTER OF THE LAW'A listing for the gun then appeared on UnitedGunGroup.com, with a starting price of $5,000. By midday on Friday it had received more than 1,000 bids.United Gun Group said in a statement that as long as Zimmerman was obeying ""the letter of the law,"" the sale of his personal firearm would be allowed on the site.""While not always popular, this is where we stand. There are principles this nation was founded on, and our goal is to do our part to defend liberty,"" United Gun Group said.""We know that many lives have been forever impacted by the incident February 26, 2012, and we're truly sorry to the Martin family for their loss. We will have no further comment on the matter.""The website calls itself a ""free social network and marketplace that embraces the 2nd amendment and lawful discussion."" The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" It is contained in the Bill of Rights.In the auction listing, Zimmerman said he would use money from the sale to counter violence against law enforcement officers by Black Lives Matter, a movement that grew out of Martin's shooting. Proceeds would also go toward fighting Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton's ""anti-firearm rhetoric,"" Zimmerman said.According to the listing, the pistol is marked with the number from the Martin case in silver ink and the listing included multiple photographs of the weapon being displayed in court during Zimmerman's trial.The listing closed with a Latin phrase, ""Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum,"" meaning ""if you wish peace, prepare for war.""A lawyer for Martin's family called the sale offensive but said it would not distract the family from their work advocating against gun violence.Zimmerman has previously sold on eBay a painting depicting the American flag, and a painting he did of a Confederate flag to raise money for a Florida gunshop owner who declared his store a Muslim-free zone.(Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Tom Brown)"

""If a Trump employee told me that I had to credential or had to blacklist someone, I would not listen,"" Robert Zatkowski, director of the House Periodical Press Gallery, told The Huffington Post. For over a century, the congressional press galleries have facilitated the credentialing process for Republican and Democratic conventions alike.""The parties have designated the galleries to credential the media because we’re an impartial arbitrator,"" Zatkowski said. ""This is what we do on Capitol Hill.""Zatkowski said no one from the Trump campaign, or any other, has urged the galleries to deny credentials for July's Republican National Convention.That should come as a relief to some of the news organizations that have been barred from Trump's rallies and speeches. The Trump campaign's severe restrictions on the media have been unprecedented, including denying press credentials, at times, to The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico, Fusion, Univision, The Des Moines Register, National Review and Mother Jones. Trump's team has also targeted individual journalists, as when it ejected a New York Times reporter who'd written an article critical of the candidate's Iowa field operation. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, once threatened to blacklist a CNN reporter for leaving the campaign's designated ""press pen."" In another instance, Lewandowski grabbed reporter Michelle Fields, then of Breitbart, as she was trying to ask Trump a question.It's hardly unusual for tensions to arise between journalists and the campaigns they cover. Last year, reporters expressed concerns to the Clinton campaign over access to the candidate and dissemination of logistical information. And journalists criticized the Clinton campaign after some low-level staffers' bungled corralling of reporters at a July 4 parade.The press hasn't pushed back as forcefully against the Trump campaign's habit of blacklisting entire news outlets in apparent retaliation for critical coverage -- even though such behavior is arguably much more disturbing. However, some prominent journalists spoke out Friday to BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith as he commandeered Politico's Playbook briefing.“Reports that Donald Trump’s campaign has a ‘blacklist’ of news outlets barred from getting credentials offends the very idea of a free society and a free press,” National Press Club President Thomas Burr said. “You can call journalists ‘disgusting,’ or disparage our jobs -- we’re tough enough to take it -- but singling out certain publications for banishment is un-American.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
18,POLITICS,Panic About Transgender People In Bathrooms Echoes Logic On Racial Segregation,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/transgender-bathrooms-racial-segregration_us_5735e7ece4b08f96c182eedf,"Daughters and wives must be saved, apparently.",2016-05-13,Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tried to get a bump in the polls by saying scary things about transgender people sharing bathrooms with your kids. It didn't work.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573617f8160000b60731eb76.jpeg?ops=crop_0_0_4000_2446%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- We've hit a point in the political cycle where Republicans are trying to fuel a hysteria over transgender people going to the bathroom.They warn that transgender women -- people who were assigned male at birth but who identify their gender as female -- are, somehow, predators who will harass your wives and daughters when they go to use the loo. Think of the children, say these Republicans, and the likelihood that creepy perverts will follow them into public restrooms.That logic is absurd -- being transgender has nothing to do with being a sexual predator preying on children in bathrooms (plenty of cisgender men have that covered) -- but it's not new. It goes back decades, and it has been used to discriminate against an entirely different group of people: African-Americans.Jump back to 1961, for example, to a report that the Louisiana State Advisory Committee issued to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. It details the chaos of desegregation in the state, and highlights what critics at the time were saying about what it meant for the parents of white girls.""Don't wait for your daughters to be raped by these Congolese,"" Leander Perez, a leader of the White Citizens' Council of Louisiana, told a crowd of 5,000 gathered at a meeting in New Orleans. ""Do something about it now.""A couple of years later, Byron De La Beckwith, a Ku Klux Klan member who assassinated civil rights activist Medgar Evers, wrote to the National Rifle Association that white people needed to take drastic measures to keep their families safe because of desegregation.""For the next fifteen years we here in Mississippi are going to have to do a lot of shooting to protect our wives, children, and ourselves from bad negroes,"" Beckwith wrote, according to For Us, The Living, a book by Evers' wife.Compare that to the way Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who was running for president until recently, warns the public about transgender women using women's bathrooms.""There is no greater evil than predators,"" he said at a campaign event in April. ""If the law says that any man, if he chooses, can enter a women's restroom, a little girl's restroom, and stay there, and he cannot be removed because he simply says at that moment he feels like a woman, you're opening the door for predators.""Cruz made demonizing transgender people a focal point in the waning days of his presidential campaign. He released an ad last month with the sole purpose of terrifying people about transgender women being in women's bathrooms.""Should a grown man pretending to be a woman be allowed to use the women's restroom?"" read words across the screen. ""The same restroom used by your daughter? Your wife? It's not appropriate. It's not safe.""North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) went as far as signing a law this year to ban transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity. He, too, has issued warnings about transgender people trying to jump into showers with kids.""Would you want a man to walk into your daughter's shower and legally be able to do that because mentally they think they are of the other gender?"" McCrory said in March.Texas' lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick (R), said a couple of weeks ago that it's not safe for any female to have a transgender woman peeing in a stall next to them.""This issue is plain and simple: we should not allow men into women’s restrooms,"" Patrick said. ""I certainly don’t want a man going into a bathroom or locker room with my mom, my wife, my daughter or my granddaughter.""Compare those sentiments to the words of the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who in 1950 warned white people to ""wake up"" and see the ill effects of desegregation on America.""White people, wake up before it is too late,"" he said. ""Do you want Negroes working beside you, your wife, and your daughters, in your mills and factories?""A deeper dig shows that people have been using this tactic to discriminate against black people for more than 100 years, at least.An 1890 editorial in The New Orleans Times-Democrat lambasts the Louisiana legislature for failing to pass a bill to create separate train cars for black and white people, and states that a white man ""would be horrified at the idea of his wife or daughter"" seated next to a black man. In 1898, a North Carolina newspaper ran a poem urging proud white people to defend the ""spotless virtue"" of their wives and daughters from black men.""I will die on this issue politically,"" Texas Rep. Matt Shaheen (R) declared. ""I am going to bat for my wife and daughters.""He said that two weeks ago, and he was talking about transgender people going to the bathroom."

22,SPORTS,FIFA Finally Appoints A Woman To A Key Position,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fifa-finally-appoints-a-woman-to-a-key-power-position_us_57360651e4b077d4d6f2ed16,Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura is FIFA's new Secretary General.,2016-05-13,Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura previously worked as a UN coordinator in Nigeria.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57360c78160000b60731eb54.jpeg?cache=nwm5gAHiPG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At many companies, societal gender roles rule the workforce: Women earn less than men, they get promoted less frequently and generally have less power. No organization is immune to these forms of systematic sexism, especially FIFA, which has never appointed a woman to a non-gender based position on the FIFA Council. In a historic first step toward reversing that course, the organization appointed Nigeria's United Nations coordinator Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura to Secretary General on Friday, permanently replacing Jérôme Valcke, who was banned from FIFA in February for 12 years on corruption charges. Samoura will have different tasks from what Valcke managed, but the Senegal citizen will still wield huge power and influence. FIFA's recent restructuring separates powers, which actually empowers her role within as Secretary General even more -- a legitimate first for women working in high-level FIFA jobs.""I also look forward to bringing my experience in governance and compliance to bear on the important reform work that is already underway at FIFA. FIFA is taking a fresh approach to its work -- and I am eager to play a role in making that approach as effective and lasting as possible,"" Samoura said in a press release.After Samoura passes her integrity check by an independent Review Committee, she'll secure a critical seat on the new FIFA Council, a strategic planning body that includes newly elected President Gianni Infantino, vice presidents and nation member representatives. As Secretary General, Samoura will be charged with implementing the council's plans through her leadership of the General Secretariat, FIFA's administration body. The General Secretariat controls FIFA's finances, business, competition organization and international relations, so the council can't dip any of their potentially corrupt mitts into the war chest. Previously, the much-criticized, male-dominated Executive Committee controlled all of that. Now, a woman does. Tennis legend and LGBT advocate Billie Jean King hailed the decision on Friday, chiming in on Twitter to tacitly remind us of FIFA's disappointing history of treating women with respect. Samoura's appointment seems to indicate that behavior like that of former FIFA president Sepp Blatter -- who once remarked that players should wear tighter shorts to “create a more female aesthetic” -- has no place in their Zurich, Switzerland, headquarters. Neither will examples of FIFA hiring a female anti-bribery expert as a consultant and then ignoring all of her suggestions. There are 123 countries with women's national teams, according to espnW, so simply having one woman fill the ""female member of the executive committee"" position (taken up by Burundi's Lydia Nsekera in 2013) won't do.Soccer is a sport that millions of people compete in. The Women's World Cup was a hit in the U.S. last summer, and it's led to growth within the American women's game and their pay. Now that there's an experienced woman sitting at FIFA's table, women's soccer has gained its most powerful voice yet. Like King said, it's a first step in FIFA reforming and organizing itself to reflect the participation, professionalism and skill of women in soccer."

In that project, researchers found that participants' metabolic rates decreased dramatically after they voluntarily starved themselves.Considering those results, ""no one should be surprised"" by what happened to ""The Biggest Loser"" contestants, Sharma told The Huffington Post by phone.Sharma believes “The Biggest Loser” sends the “exact, 100 percent wrong message” on what it takes to effectively and sustainably lose weight. And he's doubtful of the level of support contestants receive -- both during, and especially after, the show.“They should have been able to predict these outcomes or at least warn people. Maybe they did and maybe they didn’t,” Sharma said. “You’d have to be pretty crazy to sign up for this show now.”The show's host, Bob Harper, appeared Fridayon Today and addressed the study, calling it “super interesting.” Harper said the research spoke to the difficulty of sustaining weight loss using any approach, rather than an indictment of the NBC show specifically.""Our bodies want to be the weight that we've been for such a long time,"" Harper told Today’s Savannah Guthrie. ""That's why it's such a battle. … That’s why you have to be so diligent.”If the approach to weight loss championed by the show isn't the one recommended by medical professionals, why has ""The Biggest Loser"" remained a hit since it debuted in 2004, expanding to dozens of international editions, video games, cookbooks and resorts? And is it ethical for the show to remain on the air given its impact on participants and viewers?Of course, all “Biggest Loser” contestants do sign onto the show knowing, to some degree, what they are getting into based on past seasons. The series is known for its intense approach to motivating participants to lose as much weight and exercise as intensely as possible. Screaming and crying are the norm.Still, some former contestants have spoken openly about their post-show struggles in recent years. Arguably the most vocal among them is season three contestant Kai Hibbard, who said the show caused her to develop an eating disorder. In an essay for xoJane last year, Hibbard called her participation in the show “the biggest mistake I’ve ever made.”“My experience felt more than just physically bad, and the more distance I was able to put between myself and a production team that reminded me I was ‘lucky’ to be treated the way I was, the more I understood how harmful the show actually is,” Hibbard wrote.Some associated with the show, including other former contestants, have continued to defend the program amid such criticisms, calling its environment a “positive” one. NBC has said in the past that all the contestants are “closely monitored and medically supervised” and that their transformations “speak for themselves.”""We have comprehensive procedures and support systems in place which we routinely re-evaluate to ensure all contestants receive the best care possible,"" the show's producers said via spokesman Joe Schlosser. ""The lead medical doctor on the show, who has worked with the National Institutes of Health on initiatives in the past relating to ‘The Biggest Loser,’ has been made aware of this most recent study and is in the process of evaluating its findings.”By some measures, the show is right to defend itself. The new study did show that 57 percent of participants maintained weight loss totaling at least 10 percent of their body weight. That's a significant amount -- and a much higher success rate than similar groups of people whose long-term weight loss success has also been researched. Another study actually found that losing weight quickly lasts longer than losing it slowly.Contestants aside, some are questioning what kind of impact ""The Biggest Loser"" has on its audience.Some viewers clearly come away from the show feeling inspired — that if these people can change their lives, so can anyone. Given how many people in the U.S. are obese or overweight — approximately 71 percent of adults — this sort of inspirational message clearly has a large audience.“We live in perennial hope that something will work,” David Levitsky, a professor of human ecology at Cornell University, told HuffPost. “People will never give up on this idea or dream that they can be anything they want. And that idea is sold to us by companies that make a lot of money.”But the show’s message doesn’t seem to be pushing people into action.A 2013 study published in the American Journal of Health Behavior found that individuals who watched a “Biggest Loser” workout were actually less motivated to want to go exercise afterward.Watching the show also appears to increase audiences’ biases against overweight people. Two separate studies have shown that watching “The Biggest Loser” reinforces stereotypes that the obese are lazy or gluttonous, lacking the willpower to lose weight.That stigma doesn’t help those who are overweight become healthier. In fact, the opposite is true. A 2014 study from University College London found that weight discrimination not only fails to encourage weight loss, but also can spur additional weight gain.There's a reason for that. Robert Kushner, a professor specializing in nutrition and weight management at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, said the show is “in direct contrast” with “everything we’ve been trying to get across and disseminate to the public [obesity] for years now.”Kushner added that he sees the show as particularly demeaning to its contestants when you compare it to how individuals with other chronic diseases are treated in the media. That sends a message to viewers.“You would never do this to someone with another illness like diabetes or cancer,” Kushner told HuffPost. “I find it extremely disturbing that we take individuals and have them stripped down to their underwear and have them weigh in.”Still, the job of many TV shows is to entertain, not educate. And that's particularly true of reality television, argues Peter Christenson, a professor of media studies at Lewis & Clark College. Considered within the broader genre, “The Biggest Loser” is just one of many shows that “models behaviors and values that are pretty superficial,” Christenson said.In that sense, Christenson argues, it’s probably irrelevant to many of the show's viewers whether contestants they cheered on during their season kept the weight off or not.“I would ask the question, ‘What else could we possibly expect?’” Christenson said. “The audience is not interested in whether or not that person six or 10 years later is healthy and slim or whether they’ve ballooned to 450 pounds again. It’s all going to be in the present.”Some shows take a more nuanced approached to weight loss — Christenson applauded a diet and exercised-focused BBC show called “Honey, We’re Killing the Kids!” that ran a U.S. version on ABC Family beginning in 2006.That show only ran for two seasons, getting to an issue both Kushner and Sharma raised: Helping people lose a moderate amount of rate slowly over time and maintain that weight loss wouldn’t necessarily make for the most exciting television.“If a camera crew followed me in my office, the show probably wouldn’t have high ratings,” Kushner said. “‘Are you tracking your diet? Are you weighing yourself? Are you clearing your house of problem foods? Are you walking to the bus stop?’ That’s the stuff I talk about. I don’t think that’s made for TV.”It's not clear whether ""The Biggest Loser"" will do another run: A premiere date for the next season has yet to be announced, and ratings were down 30 percent last year and lower than expected this year.And as for our own weight-loss battles, there is no reason to feel that all hope is lost. Levitsky argues that instead of aiming for a dramatic weight loss, setting one's sights on a more manageable target -- 10 percent of body weight -- could still do a lot of good. After all, that is the weight loss that a majority of ""Biggest Loser"" participants maintained in the new Obesity journal study.“Instead of looking for a 200-pound weight loss, if people could just produce a 10 percent weight loss, most of us would be much better off,” Levitsky said.---"

Considered within the broader genre, “The Biggest Loser” is just one of many shows that “models behaviors and values that are pretty superficial,” Christenson said.In that sense, Christenson argues, it’s probably irrelevant to many of the show's viewers whether contestants they cheered on during their season kept the weight off or not.“I would ask the question, ‘What else could we possibly expect?’” Christenson said. “The audience is not interested in whether or not that person six or 10 years later is healthy and slim or whether they’ve ballooned to 450 pounds again. It’s all going to be in the present.”Some shows take a more nuanced approached to weight loss — Christenson applauded a diet and exercised-focused BBC show called “Honey, We’re Killing the Kids!” that ran a U.S. version on ABC Family beginning in 2006.That show only ran for two seasons, getting to an issue both Kushner and Sharma raised: Helping people lose a moderate amount of rate slowly over time and maintain that weight loss wouldn’t necessarily make for the most exciting television.“If a camera crew followed me in my office, the show probably wouldn’t have high ratings,” Kushner said. “‘Are you tracking your diet? Are you weighing yourself? Are you clearing your house of problem foods? Are you walking to the bus stop?’ That’s the stuff I talk about. I don’t think that’s made for TV.”It's not clear whether ""The Biggest Loser"" will do another run: A premiere date for the next season has yet to be announced, and ratings were down 30 percent last year and lower than expected this year.And as for our own weight-loss battles, there is no reason to feel that all hope is lost. Levitsky argues that instead of aiming for a dramatic weight loss, setting one's sights on a more manageable target -- 10 percent of body weight -- could still do a lot of good. After all, that is the weight loss that a majority of ""Biggest Loser"" participants maintained in the new Obesity journal study.“Instead of looking for a 200-pound weight loss, if people could just produce a 10 percent weight loss, most of us would be much better off,” Levitsky said.---"
25,GOOD NEWS,Volunteer Vets Test Pups For Lead Poisoning In Flint,Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dog-tested-for-lead-in-flint_us_57349724e4b077d4d6f23cda,Flint’s pups are not fur-gotten.,2016-05-12,A dog being held by a volunteer after having its blood drawn during a lead screening event in Michigan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573497bb160000b60731e8f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Humans in Flint, Michigan, are not the only ones who have had it rough.Dogs in Flint were also exposed to significant levels of lead during the city’s infamous water crisis. But many of Flint’s pups can now pant easy thanks to a team of volunteer veterinarians, technicians and students from Michigan State University who have volunteered their time to screen dogs for traces of lead.And the results will make your tail wag as well.The Associated Press reports that out of the 266 dogs that have been tested so far, there have only been seven documented cases of lead toxicity.""The major focus so far has been on human health, and rightfully so,"" Daniel Langlois, Michigan State assistant professor, told The AP. ""But at the same time, there are a lot of pets that live in the city of Flint, and we just wanted to make sure their health wasn't ignored.""Though the actions of this volunteer team -- which CNN reports used ""gifted research funds"" for supplies rather than taxpayers’ money -- could make one’s heart all warm and fuzzy, they do have another motive for their screening events: furthering their education.""Lead intoxication is extremely rare in dogs and cats. It's a really unique situation for veterinarians as well,"" Langlois told CNN.The problem with Flint’s drinking water occurred in 2014 when the Michigan city switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River and failed to use corrosion controls. The result was lead in the drinking water, which if consumed, can lead to severe health risks such as hearing loss, constipation, miscarriages and abnormal sperm, seizures and other neurological problems for not just humans but for dogs as well.Because lead exposure has the same adverse affects for hounds as it does for humans, the Michigan State team has the same recommendations for Flint’s pooches as they do for people -- only drink bottled and filtered water.It’s the best thing Flint citizens -- and their canines -- can do to keep their health out of hot water."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders proposed barring financial executives from sitting on the boards of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks in an op-ed in The New York Times in December.The Clinton campaign statement came in response to a letter to Fed chair Janet Yellen from 11 Democratic senators and 116 House Democrats. The letter, spearheaded by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), urged the Fed to appoint more women and people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds while expanding the representation of consumer and labor groups on regional Fed bank boards.Currently, the vast majority of Fed bank board directors are white men. People representing either the financial industry or other major business sectors also occupy most of the seats.The Fed’s control over monetary policy allows it to raise borrowing costs to head off inflation and reduce them to maximize employment. The members of Congress who wrote to Yellen argue that the disproportionate influence of financial officials and the lack of diversity at the Fed hamper its sensitivity to groups with a more precarious position in the job market.Clinton had said virtually nothing about her agenda for the powerful central bank until now. The Fed Up campaign, a coalition of progressive groups headed by the Center for Popular Democracy that has been at the forefront of recent efforts to make Federal Reserve reform a key part of the liberal agenda, confirmed that it has been in talks with the Clinton campaign for months.“Secretary Clinton did the right thing today by coming out in favor of reforming the Federal Reserve,” said Ady Barkan, director of Fed Up. “We’re very excited that she listened to the voices of community leaders from around the country who have said that we need a Federal Reserve that reflects and represents the American people and that creates a strong economy for all.” Some liberal economists previously noted that Clinton’s reticence about the Fed was inconsistent with her stated plans to return the country to the prosperity of the late 1990s, which enabled widespread wage growth. They argue that the era’s well-distributed economic gains were due in no small part to the permissive monetary policies of the Federal Reserve.Dean Baker, one such economist and a co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, was elated to hear about Clinton’s remarks.“Holy shit -- that’s great news,” Baker said in an email upon receiving the news.“While Senators Sanders, Warren, and others on the left side of the party took the lead, it appears there is now widespread agreement among top Democrats that the Fed has to redouble its commitment to full employment and to be more attentive to how its policies affect African Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities,” Baker continued. “There is also agreement that the Fed's current archaic structure needs to be changed.”"
27,BUSINESS,Why Major Corporations Now Realize They Can't 'Outsource Sleep',Suzy Strutner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corporations-sleep_us_5730bb05e4b096e9f0920bc7,The #SleepRevolution has arrived at your desk.,2016-05-12,"An employee takes a nap in a nap pod which blocks out light and sound at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5730ce9c2200003600256076.jpeg?cache=WSx5MiDssx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In our lightning-fast, on-demand, plugged-in workforce, top executives can outsource pretty much any task they can't find the time or energy to do themselves. Except, of course, sleep. Lately, a growing wave of top business leaders have been pulling out all the creative stops to encourage employees to get more sleep. Executives from Aetna's Mark Bertolini to Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg have made statements about the importance of rest to their companies' success.It's the sign of a shifting paradigm that has leaders asking their colleagues to work smarter, not harder. And smarter, as it turns out, means more and better sleep. A host of corporations known for long working hours are now urging longer sleeping hours, instead. Aetna, for example, is offering to pay its employees up to $300 per year if they get seven hours per night, plus an additional $200 for committing to other ""wellness activities"" related to fitness and nutrition. Consulting firm McKinsey & Company conducted a study on the impact of sleep in the workplace. Nap rooms are a common sight at Google, Zappos and Ben & Jerry’s, to name a few, while Facebook has held sleep workshops to teach employees about the benefits of increased z's. The sleep fascination has extended into brand identities, too: JetBlue, for example, installed nap pods in its new terminal at John F. Kennedy airport last month. And as part of a partnership with The Huffington Post, Marriott distributed cards with Arianna Huffington's sleep tips to its hotel guests last month, while publishing a series of articles on how to make vacation a time for both activity and healthy rest. Though diverse, all of these programs have the same critical goal: to get us to sleep more, whether we're the consumer or the employee.“How an employee sleeps at home directly impacts how they function at work,"" Nancy Rothstein, director of Circadian Corporate Sleep Programs, told HuffPost. ""And that’s something [corporations] have never thought about... An employer cannot outsource an employee’s sleep.” Rothstein acknowledges that we're at a ""tipping point,"" where sleep will soon emerge as the corporate zeitgeist of our day. Big companies have long focused on fitness and nutrition for their employees, she says, but the final and most important point of that triangle is sleep. And it took quantitative research to finally get companies to listen up. One study that's been getting attention lately found people who are sleep deprived perform the same or worse as those who are legally drunk on a whole host of cognitive tasks. Another study, co-authored by sleep specialist Els van der Helm, found that sleep affects every key behavior needed for good leadership, even though 43 percent of corporate leaders don't get enough sleep for most of the week.Both Rothstein and van der Helm told HuffPost that data like these have succeeded at getting corporations to pay attention to the power of sleep. And this attention, they hope, will lead to workplace changes that stick. ""Once you believe you can change, you need to be convinced it's necessary and worth it,"" van der Helm says. She leads sleep workshops at companies like HuffPost and Facebook to do just that.So where are we headed in this corporate #SleepRevolution? Companies often outfit their workers with fitness trackers to document sleep, but the ultimate answer goes beyond that, Rothstein says. She sees a future of sustainable change in which people get quality sleep, not just more of it. Office sleep programs that check in with workers week after week would majorly change corporate culture, she says. And with this newfound focus on the importance of sleep, they could be commonplace very soon.And THAT is good news for all of us."

Ron Johnson received a visit from Lord Business, the movie's villain -- a setup from Democratic challenger Russ Feingold's campaign.",2016-05-12,"Sen. Ron Johnson has said that ""The Lego Movie"" is ""insidious.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5734daca130000f004381722.jpeg?cache=PpuXZhnUgt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Facing a tight re-election battle, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Thursday got an ""endorsement"" from Lord Business -- the villain from ""The Lego Movie,"" which Johnson once characterized as ""propaganda"" against business owners.The endorsement -- shared exclusively with The Huffington Post -- was a setup from the campaign of Johnson's Democratic opponent, former Sen. Russ Feingold, to highlight an issue of contention between the two candidates: the Trans-Pacific Partnership.On Thursday, a staffer dressed as Lord Business went to Johnson's Milwaukee office to offer his endorsement -- on the condition that he come out in favor of President Barack Obama's trade agreement. Feingold opposes TPP, while Johnson has yet to declare a position, claiming he wants to read the full text of the deal before making a decision.However, Johnson voted last year to give Obama ""fast-track authority"" to authorize trade negotiations with limited congressional oversight -- a vote that Feingold has been quick to point out.Trade is a major issue in the Wisconsin Senate race, where voters are concerned that TPP could jeopardize the state's manufacturing jobs. The progressive Feingold, whom Johnson ousted from the Senate during the tea party wave in the 2010 elections, came out against the deal last May, calling it ""a raw deal for Wisconsin families.""""We want to encourage exporting Wisconsin products — not Wisconsin jobs,"" he said in February.Feingold has touted his long-standing opposition to trade deals, including his vote against NAFTA in the 1990s, and has made the negative effects of free trade the subject of prior campaign ads. Johnson, a businessman, has supported previous U.S. trade deals, arguing that free trade ""lifts all boats"" and would create jobs. His campaign criticized Feingold's position against TPP, calling it an attempt to score ""cheap political points by condemning this deal before he'd even read it.""As for why Lord Business and ""The Lego Movie"" are relevant to the race, Johnson last year claimed the film is ""insidious"" anti-capitalist propaganda against business owners because it depicts Lord Business as an evil executive destroying the world for profit.“I actually called a gentleman, it was a couple months ago, he was so upset, he took his children to an animated movie ... guess who the villain was? Evil Mr. Businessperson. It’s insidious. That propaganda starts very early,” Johnson said.When The Huffington Post's Ryan Grim wrote about the incident, Johnson responded on his blog, musing that “some liberal writer at The Huffington Post ... can’t seem to figure out why I or anyone else would say this about ‘The Lego Movie,’ and he insinuates some kind of conspiracy.”Last August, the blog post became the subject of an ethics complaint from a Democratic watchdog group because it was featured on Johnson's Senate website and then mysteriously deleted, along with a few other posts targeting Feingold. The Senate Ethics Manual states that senators and staff members cannot use Senate Internet “for personal, promotional, commercial, or partisan political purposes.”On Friday, Feingold's campaign will feature the ""endorsement"" in an email to supporters, fashioned as a letter addressed to Johnson ""from the desk of Lord Business.""""We haven’t officially met, but I know you’re familiar with my work in 'The Lego Movie,'"" the letter reads. ""Truth be told, I see a lot of myself in you, which is why it meant so much to me when you stuck up for me after the Lego Movie. I agree, 'The Lego Movie' really was part of an 'insidious' campaign of 'propaganda' against business owners. People like you and me have to stick together!"""

30,BUSINESS,Pension Funds Tell Exxon To Tell The Truth About Climate Change,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-climate-change_us_5734a030e4b060aa78197dc2,Shareholders think the company isn't saying enough about the risks it faces.,2016-05-12,New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer signed a letter calling on ExxonMobil to review its risks in light of the recent Paris climate agreement.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5734a429160000b60731e908.jpeg?ops=crop_856_363_2644_1637%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Pension funds are putting pressure on ExxonMobil to start telling its shareholders how climate change will affect the oil giant’s business.The California public employee pension fund and the New York City pension fund, which together manage $433 billion in investments, told fellow shareholders in a letter to support a resolution calling for the company to disclose in detail how it could be harmed by new government policies limiting carbon emissions and other shifts due to climate change.ExxonMobil, hurting from low oil prices, was recently stripped of the top credit rating by Standard & Poor’s for the first time since the 1930s. The company has also been dogged by reporting from the Los Angeles Times and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism showing that it knew for far longer than it publicly acknowledged that climate change was caused by emissions from burning fossil fuels.In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and CalPERs Investment Director Anne Simpson said, “We believe investors would benefit from an assessment of Exxon Mobil’s oil and gas reserves under a scenario consistent with the global emissions reduction target defined in The Paris Agreement.” The agreement asks countries to commit to keeping climate change below 2 degrees Celsius.On Wednesday, a group of about 1,000 academics signed a letter supporting the ExxonMobile resolution, along with a similar measure at Chevron.ExxonMobil's board does not support the resolution and fought unsuccessfully to have it dismissed by the SEC. Asked for comment, ExxonMobil spokesman Scott Silvestri referred The Huffington Post to the company's proxy statement, which argues against the resolution.In its annual report released in February, the company included a limited recognition that “governments will enact policies that impose rising costs on energy‑related CO2emissions.” ExxonMobil also said in the report that it assumes carbon emissions will be priced at $80 per ton in 20 years. Currently, there is no stated, national price on carbon in the U.S., but some states have implemented carbon pricing plans, and hundreds of companies are using internal carbon prices to make investment decisions.U.S. companies are not currently required to disclose climate change risks to investors. Global regulators are examining a set of voluntary guidelines to standardize disclosure of climate risks.In April, the company told HuffPost that its climate disclosure is adequate. “ExxonMobil believes the risk of climate change is real and warrants action. ExxonMobil is taking action by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our operations, helping consumers reduce their emissions, supporting research and participating in constructive dialogue on policy options,” said spokesman Alan Jeffers."

A lot of fans.More than two-thirds of Americans -- 68 percent -- believe the members of the women's national team deserve to make as much money as their counterparts on the U.S. Men's National Team, according to a new poll from Public Policy Polling. Just 17 percent disagree.The message of support holds across political lines. Eighty-one percent of Democrats say they want the women to receive equal pay, along with 63 percent of independents and even 55 percent of Republicans.The U.S. Women's National Team has been embroiled in this dispute with the federation that governs American soccer since April, when five of the team's players filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission asking it to investigate whether they had been paid unfairly. The complaint asserts there is a 25 percent gap between what the top male players and the top female players can make, in large part due to the teams' bonus structures.The women are paid a $72,000 salary if they play 20 matches per year for the national team, and they earn an additional $1,350 bonus for winning friendly matches. The men, by contrast, are not paid a salary but earn much larger bonuses for their matches: as much as $17,000 for a win and $5,000 for a loss. Under that structure, the women argue, a man who plays in 20 matches will make at least $100,000 even if his team loses every match, which is more than a woman can make if her team wins every match.U.S. Soccer has disputed those numbers, and the two sides have publicly wrangled over whose version of the (fairly complicated) facts are correct.But the minutiae of the federation's internal finances aside, the message from other Americans seems clear: They want the women who won the 2015 Women's World Cup, and who will enter the 2016 Olympics as the favorites to win a third consecutive gold medal, to earn just as much money as the men. Public Policy Polling surveyed 1,222 registered voters from May 6 to 9. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.2 percent. Eighty percent of participants, selected through a list-based sample, responded via the phone, while 20 percent responded over the Internet through an opt-in panel. "
