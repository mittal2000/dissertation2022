Epicurious",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-hustle-12-years_us_5b9dcd6fe4b03a1dcc8d16b0,Get ready to celebrate this year's Best Picture nominees with recipes inspired by each of the nine nominated films.,2014-01-21,2014-01-21-6a00d83451cb0369e201a3fc36c374970b450wi.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-21-6a00d83451cb0369e201a3fc36c374970b450wi-thumb.jpeg,"Lauren Salkeld, EpicuriousIn keeping with Epicurious Oscar tradition, it's once again time for our annual Academy Awards Movie Menus. Get ready to celebrate this year's Best Picture nominees with recipes inspired by each of the nine nominated films. You may want to choose your menu based on your favorite film or the dishes that appeal to you most. Another option is to pick and choose recipes from each movie to create your own one of a kind Oscar feast.12 Years a Slave: This humble yet delicious feast is similar to what Solomon Northup ate while he was a slave. Red wine is suggested because it was the drink that Northup's captors used to drug him, while the blackberry cobbler points to Northup's attempt to write a letter using blackberry juice.American Hustle: This Italian-American feast directly connects to plot points in David O. Russell's crime drama. Clams Casino reminds us of the moment Irving Rosenfield bonds with Mayor Polito over spicy clams, while the chicken references the ""Piccata of the gods."" Be sure to enjoy plenty of Prosecco, and finish the meal with an Italian digestivo.Captain Phillips: This pan-African dinner features dishes popular in the pirate's native Somalia, where doro wett, ful medames, samosas, basmati rice, and halvah are popular. Coffee and fresh fruit are included as those are the only food and drink seen on the Maersk Alabama.Dallas Buyers Club: Ron Woodruff's steak house dinner date with Dr. Eve Saks was the inspiration for this simple, satisfying supper. We added the Spicy Cowboy Beans because Woodruff uses the names of Dallas Cowboys to write false prescriptions under Dr. Saks' name.Gravity: Beyond Russian vodka, there really isn't any food or drink consumed in Alfonso Cuar√≥n's science-fiction thriller. Our menu celebrates Gravity's celestial setting with a buffet of outer-space-themed dishes, including Poppy Cheddar Moon Crackers, Edible Stones (our version of meteors), Heaven-and-Earth Tempura Cakes, and a gravity-defying foam served over fresh berries for dessert.Her: This pizza night menu was inspired by Samantha and Theodore's carnival date, when she has him close his eyes and order a slice of pizza. The cupcakes are a reference to when Theodore plays Amy's new video game, and scores ""perfect mom points"" for buying cupcakes and making the other moms jealous. But don't eat too many; you wouldn't want to lose points for feeding the kids too much processed sugar.Nebraska: Beer is an important part of our Nebraska menu as alcoholic Woody Grant drinks a lot of it, insisting it doesn't count as alcohol. To soak up all the booze, we recommend a feast of dishes popular in the Cornhusker state, including steak, ice cream, popcorn, and pierogi-like pocket sandwiches called ""runza sandwiches,"" which are represented here by the Cupcake-Tin Pork Pies.Philomena: Throughout this British film, Judi Dench's Philomena shows a lot of enthusiasm for food, including omelets at a hotel breakfast buffet, croutons at a salad bar, a Buck's Fizz on the airplane, and a fruit cake served with tea at the Roscrea convent. The cake recipe calls for a porter like Guinness, which is also significant to the plot as it convinces Martin Sixsmith that Philomena's son did in fact travel to Ireland to find her.The Wolf of Wall Street: Sushi, lobster, porterhouse steaks, multiple sides, and plenty of Champagne add up to a menu of excess perfectly suited to the Jordan Belfort lifestyle. The zeppole doughnuts are a nod to Aunt Emma's comment about Belfort getting into the doughnuts at his wedding to Naomi."

She did it to free all of us females.What does ""having it all together"" look like? How the hell should I know? I've felt like things were falling apart more often than experiencing moments of having it together. The reality is we have no idea what is looks like, so how can we know if anyone has it together? I think a lot of women are suspicious of a woman who has it all together: The moms who have everything organized in their lives, their calendars color-coordinated by child, looking perfect all the time, are nice 24-7 and always have time for EVERYTHING, including baking, scrap booking, etc. You secretly wonder if they have extra hours in the day that you don't or have secret helpers. People often think I have it together because I look cute. I like to wear jeans, put on makeup and throw on funky jewelry because it makes me feel good. I have five kids and four of them can talk, the other is only three weeks old. As long as I nurse her constantly, she's happy. The other kids are not so easy to please. They'll tell you I yell, forget stuff and make mistakes often. That I can look like a crazy lunatic if I don't get sleep, my hair is having a frizzy day or they destroy the house. Let yourself off the hook. I have more junk drawers than the normal person and plan on dying with at least two active junk drawers. I think about the ""having a lot of balls in the air"" analogy. Well, I can't juggle. The other one is having a lot on your plate. I groove on that one. You see, we all have a plate and we have the buffet of life. Some of us put a lot on our plate in equal portions. Some take small portions of everything. I take different-sized portions of things just like when I go out to eat. Is it about balance or what's healthy? Hell no! It's what I feel like. I may put a lot of bread on my plate and not a lot of salad, because that day I'm splurging and feel like being decadent. Your plate changes every day, week, month and year. Some things I don't bother putting on my plate, like having organized drawers. Maybe one day a year, I'll put it on my plate, but usually my hubby does that. He's good at knowing what to get rid of and I close my eyes while he does it. I have a tendency to save recipes, cards I like, and I'm sentimental about silly things. I'm not a hoarder, except maybe shoes and costume jewelry, but this fashion lover considers those necessities. If you looked inside all your friend's brains at what is on their plates, you'd see vastly different ratios and combos. There is no wrong here, I'm not into judging others lives. Some moms do a better job than me at staying on top of school stuff. Some years my plate looked different, but adding my writing changed my plate and made me much happier. Add to that fitness, and my plate got fuller. I love to cook, but depending on what is going on, we might have something pre-packaged that is still healthy. Really, with my kids, if I make a big dinner from scratch, a few will complain and I'll wonder why I bothered. Maybe pizza is what I put on their plates, because I'm not putting stressing over dinner on my plate. Do what works for your family. You plate is yours. Don't apologize for what is important or not important to you. I'm always honest about my life and my shortcomings. Some women will respond with, ""Oh that makes me feel so better."" As in, I feel better because you're not perfect, you suck at a bunch of stuff also and I can let myself off the hook. You don't need to worry about what other women are doing if you stop comparing yourself to them. Stop doing that. It's crappy. No one wins and it doesn't honor you or them. Just rock who you are to the max and remember perfect isn't really an idea you have to live up to. It's a word. If you have a picture of what that looks like based on what someone else's life looks like... STOP! Rip up the picture in your mind and let go of all that drama. You're free to just be you.Supermom burned her cape so there is no more perfect or comparing ourselves to others; we can all put whatever we want on our plates. Knowing who you are and what you want is having it all together. After all, being true to yourself is a super power. "

She has spun her TV role improving the fitness of people who are 100 pounds (45 kilos) or more overweight into an empire of exercise DVDs, equipment, best-selling books and clothing.These days, she said, her fitness credo is all about variety and gradually ratcheting up the intensity of her workouts.""I don't lock into one type of exercise,"" said Michaels, adding the workouts she creates focus on flexibility, balance, core stabilization, power, speed and agility.""I change the workout every month, so you never adapt and never plateau.""She also advises upping the ante of a regimen at a 10 percent rate every two weeks, by increasing something, be it weight, repetitions or speed.""The more you change and stress the body the quicker it's going to adapt and change,"" she explained.Dr. Michele Olson, of the American College of Sports Medicine, agrees with the 10 percent rule as a general means of adjusting exercise intensity or length in order to gain improvements at a reasonable rate.""It can help you progress but is not such a leap that you might risk over-exertion or injury,"" the exercise physiologist said.She said periodization, or varying the type, intensity and duration of an exercise can prevent staleness, reduce fatigue and injury and produce power changes.Michaels's weekly routine is nothing if not varied.""Usually I'll do one boxing session, one yoga session, two resistance sessions a week,"" said Michaels. ""I'll also work out with friends and then once a week I'll go for a jog.""For inspiration she cites her fitness idols Jack LaLanne and actress Jane Fonda, even as she stresses the importance of knowing your limitations.""For example I've never been flexible so I'm not able to just pop into splits,"" she said. ""But the more I take care of my body the more I progress.""Michaels is quick to label her tough reputation ""a television persona created to market a television show"" even as she concedes that it resonates.""The reality is I'm not a sympathetic person. Sympathy to me is an agreement that you are sad and sorry and (can't do it),"" she said.""I'm empathetic. I get it. It's hard. It sucks. But I also know that you can do it.""Michaels see fitness as transformative and knows from experience that it can improve confidence and empower people.""I could take somebody that is a second away from having a heart attack and in four months I can have them running a marathon,"" she said. ""That's amazing. I would never have thought that was possible 10 years ago."" (Editing by Patricia Reaney and Stephen Powell)"

It wakes me up in the morning, puts me to sleep at night and is with me all day. I can't imagine my world without music. It's the universal language; what I make comes from my heart. What I listen to from others stirs it. I love to make people dance; it's a way of bringing people together regardless of religion, nationality, sexuality, belief.

At this year's forum, which runs from January 22-25 and will focus on the theme The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business, health and wellness will be a bigger focus of the conversation than ever before. The forum's first-ever health summit will feature 25 sessions on topics including mental health, personalized medicine, health systems in emerging economies, and other pressing public health issues. More than 2,000 participants representing over 100 nations will take part in the discussions, many of which will focus on the intersection between health and broader economic and social issues. ‚ÄúThe time is right to elevate the conversation on health,‚Äù said Robert Greenhill, managing director and chief business officer at the Forum, in a press release. ‚ÄúFor the past few years, the critical state of the financial system absorbed much of Davos participants‚Äô attention. This year, there is a sense that the global economy is out of intensive care and embarking on rehabilitation. As we ask how metaphorically to improve the economy‚Äôs health, literally improving the population‚Äôs health is a good place to start.‚ÄùMental health issues will be a particular focus of the conversations. The global costs of poor mental health and its repercussions are estimated at $16 trillion over the next 20 years, according to the World Economic Forum. The World Health Organization has estimated that at least 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression, and that it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. But the participants at Davos won't just be talking about health -- they'll be actively encouraged to make healthy decisions of their own. As part of the Davos health challenge, participants will be encouraged to make healthy choices when it comes to food, sleep and physical activity, and to track their activity for the week using Jawbone fitness trackers. Some of the week's notable speakers on technology and health-related panels include Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer; Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini; Arianna Huffington, president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group; actor Matt Damon; and Peter Salovey, president of Yale University.

Several had reported recent exposure to poultry or poultry markets, but the WHO said the source of infections was still under investigation.""Given the population movement prior to Chinese New Year and potentially unpredictable behaviour of influenza viruses, continued vigilance and close monitoring are needed,"" the WHO's China office said in a statement on its website.It advised people ""to continue to practice good hygiene and handle food properly"" but did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions.The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 199 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing 52 of them, according to an update on Monday from the WHO's spokesman Gregory Hartl.Several clusters of cases in people who had close contact with an infected person have been reported in China, but WHO reiterated on Monday that ""so far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission"".Hartl told Reuters last week that the United Nations health agency had noted the recent rapid increase in human H7N9 infections and was keeping a watchful eye.""So far we haven't seen anything that causes us to change our risk assessment,"" he said.The WHO's assessment is that ""the current likelihood of community-level spread ... is considered to be low.""Experts say the Northern Hemisphere's winter flu season is probably largely to blame for a significant increase in the number of cases of human H7N9 infection in recent weeks after they dwindled to almost nothing in July and August of 2013.""This trend is expected to continue through the winter months,"" said the WHO's China office.Experts have warned public health authorities and doctors to be on alert for any signals that the more widely circulating virus might be adapting or mutating to become easily transmissible between people.

Edgar Hoover spent significant resources monitoring",2014-01-20,"MONTGOMERY, AL - MAY 1956: Civil rights leader Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. relaxes at home in May 1956 in Montgomery, Alabama. (Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badf63f1f0000250122cfdf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every year, the memory of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. evokes a nationwide sense of self reflection. The legendary Civil Rights leader forced the country to take a cold, hard look in the mirror and face the bitter treatment and hypocritical denial of basic liberties to African-Americans. But years after his death, not only do the icon's words still ring true, but the government's extreme plot to bring him down proves how far the country still has to go with respect to civilian privacy. Just a few days after President Obama laid out a plan for modest changes to the National Security Agency, and months after the public clamor provoked by the leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, this Martin Luther King Day shines a light on a stain on the government's history when it went through great lengths to destroy a man it now celebrates. FBI records give a detailed account of the organization's efforts to derail King's civil rights work. After delivering his ""I Have A Dream Speech,"" at the 1963 March on Washington, the government's interest of the leader intensified. One FBI memo refers to King as ""the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country.""In an effort to prove he was under Communist influence, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover spent significant resources monitoring King's movements and eavesdropping on his communications. Attorney General Robert Kennedy gave consent, allowing the organization to break into King's office and home installing phone taps and bugs to track the leader's movements and conversations as well as those of his associates. Although the recordings did not reveal any association with the Communist Party, they did reveal extensive details about his extramarital affairs.After learning King would be the recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, Hoover took his fanatical obsession with obliterating King to the next level. Agents sent the reverend an anonymous note, chastising him for his affairs and implying that he should commit suicide. Excerpts from the letter reveal just how far the government would go to tear the leader down: King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and a great liability to all of us Negroes. White people in this country have enough frauds of their own but I am sure they don't have one at this time anywhere near your equal. You are no clergyman and you know it. I repeat you are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that. You could not believe in God... Clearly you don't believe in any personal moral principles.  King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do it (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significance). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation.Hoover despised King with an incredible zest and put the bureau's full power behind eliminating the leader.In her new book ""The Burglary: the Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI,"" journalist and author Betty Medsger chronicles Hoover's obsession with King and overzealous violation of the leader's privacy: ""Hoover's attitude toward King can be described as a nearly savage hatred... The plot involved office break-ins, use of informers, mail opening, wiretapping, and bugging of King's office, home, and hotel rooms.""But Dr. King's story isn't one that only lives in history books, reflecting a time long past. Snowden's leak of NSA secrets revealed how much government surveillance has grown dramatically in the decade since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy reflects the memory of an utterly selfless man who prioritized peace and justice over hate and inequality, it simultaneously reveals how far a government is willing to go when it suspects that someone is a threat to the status quo, and effectively an enemy of the state.
