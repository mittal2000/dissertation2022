Here are a few surprising facts about almonds.Almonds Are In The Peach FamilyThe nut we know as the almond is technically the hard-shelled fruit of the almond tree, itself a member of the prunus family. This category of stone fruit encompasses trees and shrubs that produce edible fruit like cherries, plums, peaches and nectarines. (Don't the pits look a little bit like nuts, now that you think about it?)Take a look at how they grow: As relatives, almonds and fruit in the same family can both cause similar allergic reactions.Almonds Are Among The Lowest-Calorie NutsPer one-ounce serving, almonds are tied with cashews and pistachios at 160 calories, Health.com reported. They also have more calcium than any other nut, plus nearly 9 grams of monounsaturated, heart-healthy fats, 6 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fiber per serving.Almonds Are Best For You Raw Or Dry RoastedWhen you see packaged nuts with the word ""roasted"" on the front, consider this: They may have been heated in trans or other unhealthy fats, Judy Caplan, R.D., told Health.com. Look for the words ""raw"" or ""dry-roasted"" instead.""Raw"" Almonds Aren't Exactly ""Raw"" Two salmonella outbreaks, one in 2001 and one in 2004, were traced back to raw almonds from California. Since 2007, the USDA has consequently required almonds to be pasteurized before being sold to the public. The FDA has approved several methods of pasteurization ""that demonstrate effectiveness in achieving a reduction of possible contamination in almonds while not impacting their quality,"" according to the Almond Board of California. However, opponents of almond pasteurization argue that one such method, propylene oxide processes, poses health risks greater than that of salmonella, since the EPA has classified propylene oxide as a human carcinogen in instances of acute exposure.You Can Make Your Own Almond MilkAll you'll need are some almonds, a sweetener of your choosing, some water and a food processor!Almonds Pack Quite The Disease-Fighting Punch According to 2006 research, just one ounce of almonds contains about the same amount of polyphenols, antioxidants thought to help fight off heart disease and cancer, as a cup of broccoli or green tea. However, considering that the research was funded at least in part by the Almond Board of California, we may have to take this one with a grain of salt."

You can't plan to reach another person on a deep level, it just happens. So those are the moments that I think I really live for. MP: What makes you feel vulnerable? Being nice. Sometimes, being happy or being nice can leave me feeling a bit hung out to dry. Especially if everyone else who I'm around is way more guarded. Doesn't it seem like being nice is underrated right now though?

2,QUEER VOICES,Forget Invisibility: Visibility Is the New Superpower,"Timothy Holbrook, Contributor

The Fantastic Four's Invisible Woman. In comics and fantasy, invisibility is an important superpower, one that may soon exist in the real world. For lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender persons (LGBT), however, visibility is the more potent superpower.  President Obama's selection of openly gay athletes as part of the U.S. Olympic delegation to Sochi, Russia -- in apparent protest of Russia's anti-gay laws  -- is one demonstration of this power. Aside from protest, the visibility of LGBT persons makes us familiar and more difficult to demonize as some unknown, scary ""other."" Instead, we are familiar faces on TV, or colleagues, or sisters, brothers, sons, or daughters.  The power of visibility has unique force in sports where, particularly for gay men, the stereotype is that gays are unathletic. When coupled with the prominence that sports plays in American culture, visible LGBT athletes (and even straight allies) can help change minds. People, particularly children, mirror their behavior based on the acts of professional athletes. As the Supreme Court brief joined by NFL players Chris Kluwe, Brendon Ayanbadejo, and Scott Fujita in support of marriage equality explained, ""Sports figures receive a celebrity status that influences a large majority of the population ... [professional sports] at the league level, team level, and individual level are finally speaking out against homophobia and intolerance of LGBTQ individuals."" When one of my openly gay students, who was also a collegiate athlete, found out that I was co-counsel for Kluwe and Ayanbadejo, he sent me a note thanking me ""for drafting this document that expressly connects sports and gays in a way that is rarely spoken about in public forum."" Sports Illustrated placed the coming out story of then-active NBA player Jason Collins on its cover, launching a national conversation about sexual orientation in professional sports. Visibility in sports can change minds and mitigate negative stereotypes.The importance of visibility is not limited to sports: LGBT visibility of other celebrities is also important because the community has not achieved complete social acceptance. Robin Roberts, Anderson Cooper, Meredith Baxter, and Wentworth Miller all garnered considerable press when they disclosed that they are gay. Chaz Bono's disclosure that he is transgender moved mountains in terms of acceptance for transgender persons. The fact that any of these disclosures is newsworthy is evidence, however, that, sexual orientation and identity still matters to us. In fact, being anything other than ""straight"" matters; you don't see headlines when a male celebrity announces that he dates women. Yet visibility breeds broader acceptance for the community by making us familiar and known.The visibility of LGBT politicians is as, if not more, important, particularly as the House of Representatives considers the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), prohibiting LGBT employment discrimination nationally. Currently, there is no federal law prohibiting LGBT discrimination. In 29 states, it is legal to refuse to hire, fire, or deny housing to someone because of their perceived sexual orientation. That number jumps to 33 states when it comes to gender identity. As of December 2013, same-sex marriage is unavailable in 32 states, denying couples crucial rights such as adoption, parental rights, hospital visitation, and end-of-life decisions, with predictable and potentially disastrous -- not to mention heartbreaking -- consequences.In November, Congressman Michael Michaud of Maine came out as gay in an op-ed to the people of Maine. Michaud immediately tried to de-emphasize the importance of his sexual orientation by rhetorically asking ""why should it matter?"" On one level he is correct -- his sexual has nothing to do with his qualifications as congressman or governor. On another, though, he is completely wrong. His visibility to his colleagues impacts how they view the LGBT community. Now, those opposed to ENDA will have to look into the eyes of Michaud, Sean Patrick Maloney, Jared Polis, and other openly gay representatives and say, ""your rights do not matter to me."" When opponents to LGBT equality realize that we are actually friends and colleagues, justifying discrimination becomes far more difficult. Such visibility makes us persons, not strangers that are easy to dismiss. Indeed, being visible can change minds.  Senator Rob Portman reversed his opposition to same-sex marriage after his son came out to him as gay. This is not to suggest that all LGBT persons must be out professionally and personally. Some people choose to keep their sexual orientation private. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and actor George Clooney, both vocal supports of LGBT equality, have refused to disclose their sexual orientation. That is their right, as it is the right of others, gay or straight. But others recognize the power of, and need for, visibility, such as gold medalist Olympic skater Brian Boitano. After years of declining to address his sexual orientation, he finally came out after his appointment to the Sochi Olympic delegation. Such visibility remains essential to LGBT progress. Be it as a form of protest of Russian homophobic laws to changing the minds of everyday people, visibility makes discrimination against LGBT persons lose any supposed legitimacy. The LGBT community can only advance itself by being at the table, which means that everyone else gathered knows we are LGBT."

Irrespective of where you live the human-induced effects of global warming are irrefutable and deadly. The Waratah Coal Project is part of the expanding Galilee Basin in western Queensland that will bring Australia's coal export to whopping 240 million metric tons per annum -- a projected increase of five fold under Prime Minister Tony Abbott's new Coalition government. As humans ramp-up the destruction of nature in Australia, Canada, Indonesia and elsewhere to feed the insatiable coal and petroleum markets in China, India and the U.S. the amount of melting ice at both poles continues to erode at an astounding rate.In the Northern Hemisphere less Arctic ice cover in September means that a warming Arctic Ocean is easily able to infuse its latent heat into the Arctic atmosphere. As this occurs an all-hell-break-loose scenario is felt elsewhere - particularly on the eastern half on the North American continent and in the U.K. A warming Arctic is loosing its ice cover quickly.The Arctic is warming at least two times faster than the rest of our planet. It's not just the loss of the white surface, which reflects solar radiation back to space and helps keep Earth at a habitable temperature range for our species that is a concern.A warming Arctic Ocean of 1.8 degrees (F) has caused the upper atmosphere to change, dramatically. The polar jet stream is a powerful upper atmosphere, sinuous river of air, which normally hugs the North Pole tightly, but since it has been super-charged with Arctic Ocean heat it's migrating with regularity - southward.A meandering polar jet stream spells epic wild weather. A meandering polar jet stream opens the deep-freezer door and pours frigid polar air onto the U.S. during the first week of January 2014.A massive winter blizzard on January 3, 2014 throughout the Northeast dumped feet of snow with Arctic air spilling bone-chilling temperatures across at least half of the United States. On the Northern Plains, including Iowa, Minnesota, Dakotas and eastern Montana the mercury has plummeted with wind chills reaching in excess of -50 degrees (F). The first blizzard of 2014 brought feet of snow across the Northeast and teeth-chattering temperatures across the Northern Plains.It is so cold that Sunday's Wildcard Playoff game at Green Bay's Lambeau Field may eclipse the January 2008 NFC Championship of -4 degrees (F) - as the coldest NFL game ever played.Meanwhile in Canada - no stranger to bitter winter temperatures - as the New Year began the eastern half of that nation was blanketed by frigid Arctic temperatures more reminiscent to those of outer space as record-breaking wind chills of in excess of -60 degrees (F) were recorded. In fact, in northern Manitoba on New Year's Eve (2013) the mercury touched -62 degrees (F) the same surface temperature as Mars; and by the way, the temperature in the North Pole that afternoon was -6 degrees (F).The meandering polar jet stream is wreaking havoc on the other side of the Atlantic in the U.K. where the Brits have been lashed and pummeled, again by walls of 30-foot waves in concert with king tides (the highest of the year) and colossal hailstones leaving a horrible wake of destruction including destroyed roads, rail lines and floods that with regularity are breaching the defenses. That destruction may be tame compared to the 50-foot waves predicted for Monday (January 6, 2014). The British coast was battered by 30-foot waves on January 1, 2014.In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia is broiling and enveloped by yet another drought fraught with bushfires. 2013 was their hottest year ever recorded. At 2 degrees (F) above the long-term average it easily surpassed 2005 as the hottest year. Every month in 2013 was 0.9 degree (F) above the normal dating back to the inception of continuous record keeping in 1910. Australia has experienced just one cooler than average year in the last decade -- 2011. Australia experienced the hottest spring on record and on January 2, 2014 South Australian temperature were in excess of 120 degrees (F).Temperatures of 120 degrees (F) occurred January 2, 2014 in South Australia whilst New South Wales is enduring its worst-ever drought. And in tropical Queensland a sweltering heat wave has temperatures there reaching 117 degrees (F). Elderly people with chronic illness, especially diabetes and obese people are at terrible risk. In addition, all pets left outside in these inferno-like temperatures stand little chance of survival.While most North American early January (2014) temperatures resemble the inside of deep freezer - California, on the other hand, is warm and bone-dry. A high-pressure system has stalled over the Eastern North Pacific Ocean diverting the moisture carried by the jet stream northward toward British Columbia and Alaska. As of January 1, 2014 California reached its driest mark since record keeping began in 1849. In Los Angeles where I live we average 14.93 inches of precipitation annually - this year we received 3.60 inches. San Francisco received a meager 3.38 inches of rainfall in 2013; its normal is 20.65 inches. A strong ridge has developed off the California coast preventing the storms carrying moisture that normally falls as snow onto the Sierra Nevada's, which supplies about 85% of the the water for the eighth mightiest economy on the globe.Currently 85 percent of California is experiencing a severe drought; this is very serious because without water the nations leading agricultural producer at $16 billion annually (including the world's largest almond crop at $3 billion, alone) is in dire straights. The drought is predicted to cost farmers at least $1 billion. Droughts are plaguing a warming world and livestock as well as vegetation have no chance of survival without the life blood of Earth -- fresh water.  California's reservoirs are at less than 40 percent capacity. The Sierra snowpack is running 23-34 percent while Oregon's Cascades are even lower between 18 and 22 percent. Californian forests are tinder-dry and without winter snowfall and the spring melt-waters to recharge soil moisture preparing the trees for a hot, dry summer we can expect hellacious firestorms later this year. When Californian forests are parched they burn during the normally dry summers, but this year (2014) without winter moisture the wildfires can begin early in the springtime.Clearly, the most precious substance on a warming Earth is its fresh water. Until we address our voracious addiction to coal and petroleum and allow innovation our best friend in the 21st century to guide us beyond the present crisis, we can expect more brutal wild weather with its massive price tag of devastation to continue.Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist, educator and author of The Incomparable Honeybee."

The increase in production is bringing development to an economically depressed region that lies atop the Marcellus shale, a rock formation that produces more natural gas than Saudi Arabia. Photographer: Ty Wright/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14e051f00003901233cbf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Valerie VolcoviciWASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Federal regulators are unlikely to step up enforcement of potential water contamination cases linked to natural gas drilling - despite new concerns about water safety - given a lack of political will and limited resources to pursue such cases, analysts said.A report quietly made public on Christmas Eve by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's internal watchdog brought back into the spotlight concerns about the effects on water quality from the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.The report said the EPA was justified in issuing an emergency order in 2011, asking the oil and gas driller Range Resources to improve monitoring and provide clean water to a family in Parker County, Texas, whose water supply had been contaminated with methane as a result of nearby fracking.The EPA Inspector General also criticized the agency for backing off enforcement of the complaint in 2012.At the time, the EPA said that as a compromise for dropping its lawsuit it would work with Range to examine the effects of fracking on drinking water in a future national study on fracking and groundwater.An EPA spokeswoman said the agency will continue to share any additional sampling data and relevant information provided by Range and other parties with the state regulator, the Texas Railroad Commission. A spokesman for Range said the company has not heard back from the EPA regarding the study.Some see the inspector general's report as justification for the EPA to more aggressively enforce pollution cases related to fracking, but other analysts and former officials say the agency lacks both the desire and capacity to do so.Fracking is regulated on a state-by-state basis. The only national EPA rule so far, on air emissions from operations, known as ""green completions,"" will take effect in 2015.The Texas contamination case was the third instance in which the EPA backed off of an initial assertive stance and instead deferred to local regulators.""As a result of three relatively unflattering outcomes, EPA may aim before it shoots in the future, but politics has been a factor, too,"" said Kevin Book, an energy analyst at Clearview Energy Partners. Ahead of congressional elections in November, Book said ""similar activism from EPA is fairly unlikely."" GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWSAmy Mall, a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said she doubts the agency will reverse what she called the trend of ""systematically pulling back from high-profile investigations"" because fracking is the ""third rail"" of U.S. energy policy.Specifically, she said, President Barack Obama may be hesitant to send any signal that federal regulators will step in to slow the expansion of natural gas production.The natural gas boom has been a bright spot for the Obama administration. Lower gas prices have helped create a domestic manufacturing renaissance and lower household energy bills while cutting greenhouse gas emissions.The administration is also aware of industry groups sounding the alarm over prospects for a national study of fracking and groundwater due to be finished in 2015 to open the door to new federal rules on fracking.U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue warned last month that the study could be used to justify clamping down on the drilling techniques that have sparked a surge in U.S. oil and natural gas output.Steve Everly, a spokesman for pro-fracking group Energy in Depth, said energy firms worry about EPA overreach.""There may be a culture of 'shoot first, ask questions later' that even the Office of the Inspector General sadly thinks is permissible,"" Everly said. ""I always thought EPA's mission was to protect the environment, not attack productive industries.""At the same time, fracking draws strong opposition from environmental groups that constitute part of the political base for Obama as well as Democrats in general.""I do hope the agency sees the particular inspector general report as providing them some additional validation and support to take future actions when necessary,"" said Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club, a former regional EPA official.Armendariz was head of the EPA's Dallas regional office when the original order was made against Range Resources. He resigned in 2012 after Sen. James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, released a video of him saying the agency should ""crucify"" oil and gas firms that violated environmental laws.While Armendariz called for a more assertive EPA, he told Reuters that technical challenges dog the agency's enforcement efforts. Cases related to energy extraction are more of a challenge than those related to clean air regulation because there are more ""technical hurdles and challenges in the subsurface,"" he said.The EPA has had a much lower rate of enforcement at energy extraction sites than it does at power plants or industrial facilities that have polluted the air, for example.In 2012, the EPA inspected 870 energy extraction sites and concluded enforcement actions against just 53. The agency investigated 836 coal-fired electric units for potential air pollution incidents and controlled 461 of them.One former EPA official said investigating energy extraction sites requires a lot of money and thousands of staff - both in short supply given tight budgets.""To do a case where it involves taking significant environmental samples in the field - it is very expensive,"" the official said."

The 1967 NFL Championship Game was a hot topic of conversation ahead of the NFL wild-card matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers during the first weekend of 2014 because the forecast called for subzero conditions at Lambeau Field. In order to freeze itself into the record books as the coldest game in NFL history, the temperature for the 49ers-Packers game would have needed to drop below -13 degrees with a wind chill colder than -48 degrees.

While the Colts' historic 45-44 win against the Chiefs in their AFC wild-card playoff game was hailed in Indianapolis, the reaction in Kansas City wasn't quite as positive. The come-from-ahead loss was the second-largest collapse in postseason history and the team's eighth straight playoff defeat.In response, the cover of the sports section of the Sunday edition of The Kansas City Star featured a provocative, not-quite profane headline and a photo of Colts quarterback Andrew Luck scoring a touchdown sure to be remembered in Indiana and Missouri.The cover was first shared on Twitter by Jeff Rosen, the Sports editor of The Kansas City Star, on Saturday night. The use of a simple, brief headline seemed to be keeping with the spirit of comments made -- and perhaps not made -- by Chiefs coach Andy Reid after the defeat. ""Sometimes the game speaks for itself, so you don't have to say a whole lot,"" Reid told reporters when asked about his postgame remarks to the team."

The Nature Boy's visit quickly heated things up in Wisconsin by inspiring an inflammatory tweet from a 49ers player. 49ers offensive tackle Anthony Davis was so appreciative of Flair's visit that he opted to insult the Green Bay area on Twitter.WARNING: NSFW LANGUAGE IN FOLLOWING TWEETSNature Boy Ric Flair flew into this shit hole to show us some love. pic.twitter.com/F6gTC4HptsThat remark understandably resulted in a social media backlash against the 24-year old from Piscataway, NJ.

The Indianapolis Colts' quarterback was in the wrong place at the wrong time after leading his team to a thrilling comeback win over the Kansas City Chiefs. He also seemed to be naked in that place, at that time. Colts punter Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) shared an image from the victorious locker room on Twitter that included an apparently nude Luck in the background. He appeared to be holding a towel or an article of clothing at his locker when the photo was taken. The only thing keeping McAfee's many social media followers from seeing the star quarterbacks' backside was an unidentified gentleman with a strategically placed phone or mobile device.

It didn't take long for him to realize that there was a nude NFL superstar in the background of the photograph. McAfee quickly deleted the tweet and sent out a few follow-up messages. In the first, he complimented Luck's physique. In the second, he hoped for his forgiveness. "
