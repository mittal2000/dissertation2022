As a practicing physician, I have devoted my professional career to promoting health equity. But I also know how hard it is to provide quality care for my patients if I don't know much about them as people -- their medical histories, their family situations, and their overall life circumstances, including, by the way, whether or not they have health insurance. The same holds true for my job as assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where I lead in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from a disaster or emergency with public health consequences. We've known for decades that poor and traditionally underserved populations are often the hardest hit in disasters, in part because they live in more disaster-prone areas and, in part, because their needs are often overlooked during emergencies. While we've spent many years documenting those facts, I believe that the next step is to move beyond knowledge gathering to create change.  Minority Health Month is a great time to share that, when it comes to disaster preparedness, response and recovery, we've been doing this.During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, we started working with the Medicare program to try to reverse a historic trend of racial and ethnic differences in getting flu shots. We quickly learned that we didn't just need to do more of the same, but that we needed to do things differently. Like understanding the backgrounds and perspectives of my patients, we needed to better understand the experiences and perspectives of communities, and to provide people access to information about how to protect themselves and their children in new ways. One result was a range of communication tools that were tailored to different audiences from health care providers to parents, could be adapted for geographical regions hardest hit, and were available for foreign language speakers. These tools come in handy during annual flu season as well.Since the pandemic, we have continued to strengthen work with diverse communities, but we also have found that we weren't taking full advantage of public data to do the best job we could. So we created a system and launched a program that enables us to map a community in a disaster and know more about the people living there. What's the average educational level? What languages are spoken? This mapping program allows us to look at facts about the community, like race, ethnicity and other demographic information to help us figure out who might need help first, and what kind of help they might need. This innovation has fundamentally changed how we work. A year ago this month, a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, exploded. In developing our response, our mapping system armed us with the knowledge that, unlike much of the rest of Texas, a big part of the community spoke Czech -- not Spanish. Similarly, when the path of Hurricane Sandy was predicted to affect a large Tagalog-speaking Filipino population, we were able to have a group of foreign language speakers at the ready to meet the language access needs of the potentially affected community.The focus on minority health has also taught us valuable lessons about how to promote community resilience. We continue to face the problem of how to incorporate the populations that are often left out, even those that are not historically vocal, into our preparedness plans. Part of the solution is to learn from the experiences of different communities. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, uniquely tight social connections provided a base for resilience in a community of Vietnamese immigrants, and the community fared far better than many of its neighbors. Taking this work to the next level will require the government, private and nonprofit sectors to work together to promote the intelligent use of social media and existing technologies, to support informal social networks, and to incorporate civic- and faith-based organizations into disaster plans. Minority Health Month reminds us how important health equity is -- not just for minority communities but for our health and strength as a nation. This is especially true in emergencies and disasters, when the best way to improve health outcomes and resilience during and after the event is to improve health before the event.It takes a community working together to prepare for, respond to and recover effectively from the destructive forces of nature and other emergencies. Ultimately, this work can only be accomplished if we understand, learn from, adapt to and celebrate our diversity."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,The 'Breaking Bad' Scene That Made Bryan Cranston Gag,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bryan-cranston-terence-winter-tribeca_n_5193907.html,,2014-04-23,"NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 22: Actor Bryan Cranston speaks during Future of Film: Part one: 'Jason Silva: Technologies Of Immersion' And Part Two: 'Psychos We Love' during the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival at SVA Theater on April 22, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4597a2400003200560dab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you're anything like Bryan Cranston, psychopaths are your ""catnip."" Of course, you probably aren't an actor who portrayed one (or something similar to one) on a beloved television drama. But James Fallon, who studies human behavior and wrote the 2013 book ""The Psychopath Inside: A Neuroscientist's Personal Journey into the Dark Side of the Brain,"" says the same thing that lured Cranston to the Emmy-winning role of ""Breaking Bad"" antihero Walter White is what prompted five seasons' worth of fan obsession. Brain research now agrees we're all born with morality and that, within the first two years of our lives, our conscience is stretched, suppressed and bent in all sorts of ways. What we're left with, in terms of popular culture, are shows like ""Breaking Bad"" and the work of Terence Winter (""The Sopranos,"" ""Boardwalk Empire,"" ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") -- projects that, as Fallon puts it, ""stretch our sense of what a person is.""At a Tribeca Film Festival panel moderated by ""Nightline"" co-anchor Juju Chang on April 22, Cranston, Winter and Fallon discussed the topic of ""Psychos We Love"" before a packed auditorium at downtown Manhattan's School of Visual Arts. Here are a few takeaways from their conversation:1. Terence Winter was rooting for Walter White. Winter won multiple Emmys for his work on ""The Sopranos,"" and last month his ""Wolf of Wall Street"" screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. In other words, he knows his way around criminalistic characters. While you were debating whether Walter White's fate was worthy of your sympathy, Winter was rooting for him. ""In terms of any character, I think any human being in all of their full range of colors and emotions, you've got to find moments of relatability, empathy,"" Winter said. ""Tony Soprano is a great example. You see him doing these horrific things, and then you realize he's having problems with his teenage kids. I've had people come up to me and say, 'It was like you were eavesdropping on a conversation with me and daughter,' and then they feel like they really understand this guy and then he goes and kills somebody and it draws you out of that.""2. Walter White is the antithesis to Archie Bunker. ""Breaking Bad"" creator Vince Gilligan set out to craft a show about ""change,"" according to Cranston. ""In most cases, television is about stasis: reliable characters who adjusted to stimuli, but basically were the same however they were. And there's comfort in that,"" Cranston said. ""Archie Bunker was fun to watch, and I appreciate his staunch, dogmatic grouchiness. But this is about the attempt to change: to go from a good character to a bad one.""3. To Winter, the best example of a good character embracing his inner evil is Michael Corleone shooting Sollozzo and McCluskey in ""The Godfather."" ""It was three shots fired in that scene, and it's one of the most intense scenes in cinema history,"" Winter said. ""You really feel like you're sitting in the shoes of a guy who's about to kill somebody for the first time."" 4. There's a reason antiheroes are so popular all of a sudden. ""In days gone by, there were those bad guys of poorly written material who were just bad. No reason, no rhyme -- they were just bad,"" Cranston said. ""It's easy for the audience to cast them aside and just go, 'I'm not even afraid of him because he's just bad.' You know where he's coming from, you know what he wants. But a more interesting, complex character is someone who I'm not sure if he's good or bad. I'm uncertain. And that's what strikes the heart of Nucky [on 'Boardwalk Empire'] and Tony Soprano and my character.""5. HBO didn't seem to understand all of Winter and ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase's characterization.  ""These characters lie to each other all the time,"" Winter said. ""We would very early on sometimes get network notes that would say, 'Well, this doesn't make sense on page 12 because Tony completely says the opposite on page 18.' I'd say, 'Yeah, he's lying.' They'd say, 'Oh!' Because all they do is lie to each other.""6. Cranston says there's one ""Breaking Bad"" moment that especially grossed him out. ""Early on, there was a scene where I instructed my young protege to buy a particular kind of plastic container to dissolve a body, and he said, 'Why do we have to do that when we have a perfectly good bathtub upstairs?' But this particular chemical eats away at porcelain, so the whole ceiling came down with all the liquified body parts and we had to clean it up,"" Cranston said. ""Even though it wasn't real, I found myself gagging.""7. Of course, there are some things that cross the line. Asked if there's anything too unspeakable to be depicted in entertainment, Winter and Cranston agreed that cruelty toward animals and children is where things get murky. But even beyond such heinous acts, writers must tread lightly (as Walter White would say).""I wrote this scene in 'The Sopranos' where Adriana got killed,"" Winter said. ""She was murdered, and I didn't do this consciously, but when I wrote this scene, I wrote that she crawls off-camera and you hear a gunshot. And somebody said, 'But you've written some of the most horrifically violent things we've seen on that show. Why did you not show her getting killed?' And I said I didn't know. At the time, it felt like the artful choice. But I didn't want to see that. I didn't want to see her get killed, and I didn't know that at the time.""8. Cranston has an interesting take on the famous ""Breaking Bad"" scene where Walt lets Jane choke on her own vomit while sleeping off a heroin binge.   ""There was a lot of discussion about how that would go,"" Cranston said. ""I had a lot of thought about that. I thought objectively about how I want to have that scene conveyed, and then I just let it go. So I first wanted to respond in a humane way to a person who's choking to death and stop it. That's the impulse, to help. And then he stops himself because he realizes that this is the same person who's blackmailing him and threatening to expose his whole enterprise and turn it upside down. But she's just a girl; she could be my daughter. And so, again, you have an impulse to do something. But I think she got Jessie on heroin and is going to kill that boy who I have an affinity for. ... His act of omission tells the story. ... For some reason, I'm looking at Krysten Ritter's face, and she did a superb job, but I superimposed, for some reason my mind went to this thing, looking at this young girl, and that thought of 'She could have been my daughter,' and my real daughter's face took her place."" 9. One clear cue a character is a psychopath: the nickname. Fallon says true psychopaths want credit for their work and therefore wouldn't accept an alter ego like Walter White's Heisenberg. An everyday person who begins to display psychopathic tendencies would split the difference by adopting an alias. 10. Males and females have different relationships to psychopathy. ""There's a genetic reason why there are so many more male psychopaths than female psychopaths,"" Fallon said. ""It turns out -- you know when you said, 'My mother made me do it?' -- the main warrior gene gets passed on the X chromosome. So the sons who are XY can only get it from the mother, whereas the females can get both forms but it's usually difficult and one gets suppressed. In an XY male, the son has nothing to oppose, so if his mother has that, he's got it."" Listen to the full panel discussion below."

The 49-year-old billionaire called on critics of his team's name and iconography to ""focus on reality"" in his latest statement on the controversy.""We understand the issues out there, and we're not an issue,"" Snyder said on Tuesday, via the Associated Press. ""The real issues are real-life issues, real-life needs, and I think it's time that people focus on reality."" Whether Snyder approves or not, the name is an issue for Oneida Indian Nation representative Ray Halbritter. ""If Dan Snyder thinks it is acceptable for a billionaire to market, promote and profit off of a dictionary defined racial slur, then he’s living in an alternate universe,"" Halbritter said in response to Snyder's latest remarks, per CBS DC. ""If he wants to focus on reality, here’s a reality check: the longer he insists on slurring Native Americans, the more damage he will keep doing to Native American communities, and the more he will become synonymous with infamous segregationist George Preston Marshall, who originally gave the team this offensive name.""Snyder's comments on Tuesday echo what he wrote in a letter in March introducing the Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation. Snyder said the foundation will ""provide meaningful and measurable resources that provide genuine opportunities."" In the letter, Snyder said he visited 26 Tribal reservations and learned that Native American communities have ""genuine issues they are truly worried about, and our team's name is not one of them."" The AP reported that Snyder did not directly respond on Tuesday to those who have criticized the foundation as a public relations stunt, like Native American golfer and Golf Channel analyst Notah Begay III. Begay told USA Today Sports on Tuesday that he thinks Snyder's foundation is ""more of a gimmick"" and an attempt to ""offset some of the public disdain for the name of his football team.""""The Washington football team's front office has tried to make the issue about them and it's really not about them,"" Begay said. ""It's about, unfortunately, the NFL and its owners and its corporate partners condoning use of that word. I don't think if a similar racially offensive word was used for the Hispanic, African American or Jewish communities that it would be tolerated."" "
3,GREEN,Happy Earth Day. We Just Reached Another Scary Climate Change Milestone,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carbon-dioxide-climate-change_n_5187844.html,,2014-04-22,"FILE - In this July 1, 2013, file photo smoke rises from the Colstrip Steam Electric Station, a coal burning power plant in in Colstrip, Mont. Colstrip is kind of plant called on by President Barack Obama's climate change plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Monday, Feb. 24, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on the unanimous federal appeals court ruling, that upheld the Environmental Protection Agency's unprecedented regulations, aimed at reducing the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. The case comes to the court amid Obama?s increasing use of his executive authority to act on environmental and other matters when Congress doesn't, or won't. (AP Photo/Matthew Brown, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb155432500009400381e77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In May 2013, it was big news when, for the first time, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit 400 parts per million. Now, researchers say that number has been consistently above 400 for the last month.""This is higher than it's been in millions of years,"" said Pieter Tans, a senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory.Parts per million, or ppm, is a measure of the ratio of carbon dioxide to other gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is just one type of greenhouse gas that has been found to trap heat, but it is the primary one emitted from human activities and it lingers in the atmosphere for a very long time. There is typically seasonal fluctuation in the parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide, according to scientists who track the levels. That explains why, after hitting 400 for the first time in recorded history last May, the levels declined soon after. But they hit 400 ppm again in mid-March, and have stayed above that level for all of April. As of April 20, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 401.17 ppm. That figure is based on readings from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The scientists who monitor atmospheric carbon dioxide levels expect that levels will stay above 400 ppm until late June or July. Tans said that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is now increasing at a rate that is at least 100 times faster than it has been at any time since record-keeping began. At some point next year or the year after, based on current rates, carbon dioxide levels will rise above 400 ppm and will not be likely to fall below that mark again.The amount of carbon dioxide that gets naturally absorbed from the atmosphere varies according to the time of year, said Tans. During late spring and early summer in the northern hemisphere, trees and plants take in more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But as emissions generated by human activities rise, those cycles can no longer offset them. ""We are basically overwhelming natural uptake processes,"" said Tans.The late Charles David Keeling, a renowned scientist affiliated with the University of California, San Diego, began keeping daily measurements of atmospheric carbon at Mauna Loa in 1958. The record showing the increasing carbon levels at the observatory is today known as the ""Keeling Curve."" His son, Ralph Keeling, is now the director of the CO2 program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC-San Diego and has continued to record those levels since his father's death in 2005.The younger Keeling says the importance of the 400 ppm figure is largely psychological. While there isn't a substantial difference between the impacts of 395 ppm and 405 ppm, crossing that threshold makes it impossible to ignore that something serious is happening.""When you focus on the fact that it's moving through thresholds like that, you get an appreciation for how it's actually changing,"" said Keeling. ""It's a wake-up call about how much we've already changed the atmosphere.""""I think people accept the reality that CO2 is rising, but they don't have a grasp of what it means quantitatively,"" he continued. ""I hope people remember this moment so that when the hear the carbon dioxide levels are 420 parts per million in a matter of years, they'll say, 'I remember when it was 400.'""Based on current trends, 420 ppm probably isn't too far off. Currently, carbon dioxide levels are increasing by about 2 parts per million per year. And few countries have given any indication that they plan to cut emissions in the near future -- at least, not enough to affect the trajectory the planet is on. ""The momentum we're seeing right now, going upwards, I think is going to easily carry us through 450 parts per million,"" said Keeling. ""And then I would say even stabilizing before 500 parts per million is probably not going to be very easy.""Bill McKibben, an author and co-founder of the group 350.org, criticized the U.S. government for not doing more to curb emissions. His group draws its name from 350 parts per million -- the level that some scientists have said is the maximum allowable for maintaining ecosystems and the human systems that depend on them.""It's the planetary equivalent of going to the doctor and hearing your cholesterol is through the roof,"" said McKibben, ""and our 'leaders' are like the patients who nonetheless won't take their medicine, won't stop smoking, won't start exercising, and won't change what they eat."""
4,IMPACT,A Green Solution to Overseas Hunger,"Helaina Hovitz, ContributorJournalist, Writer, Editor, Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-green-solution-to-overs_b_5187158.html,"It all started when a 65-year-old retired carpenter named Fred Colgan met Damon Ogle, an engineer with a new ""green"" stove design.",2014-04-22,2014-04-21-ChildreninSenegalenjoyafillingmealcookedona100LiternstitutionalCookstovebyInStove.SSB.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-21-ChildreninSenegalenjoyafillingmealcookedona100LiternstitutionalCookstovebyInStove.SSB-thumb.jpg,"Thanks to one man's vision and another man's mission, an environmentally friendly stove is offering hope around the globe in some unexpected ways.  It all started when a 65-year-old retired carpenter named Fred Colgan met Damon Ogle, an engineer with a new ""green"" stove design. ""I asked him if he thought it was something we could take to the world and serve poor people with as a nonprofit,"" said Colgan. ""I guess we were in the right place at the right time, just two stubborn old guys who wanted to make a difference.""Fred and Damon immediately got to work hand-building prototypes of a stove that featured a combustion chamber made of stainless steel surrounded by lightweight insulation. At operating temperature, which can reach 1100 degrees Celsius, the stove literally ""burns up the smoke,"" and captures over half the energy generated by the fire.Nearly three billion people worldwide cook on inefficient, biomass fires, contributing just as much to global climate change as car tailpipes do. InStove reduces the amount of fuel needed by up to 90 percent, or the equivalent to the carbon footprint of up to 2.7 American households. Overall, they save up to 88 tons of firewood each year. Here's where the nonprofit aspect comes in: individuals and organizations raise money to buy the stoves at cost and donate them to developing countries overseas, where they're used in hospitals, clinics, schools, refugee camps, and orphanages.Many people in the developing world rely on institutional settings such as these for their food security, and Pastor Jonah of Uganda is one of them. One day, Jonah found himself looking out at the children in the slums of Kampala, most of them AIDS orphans, and felt called to be their father. With no experience, no budget, and no plan, he just started taking them into his own home. Currently, he cares for 54 adopted orphans.""I could not send all of my children to school, because it starts at 7:30am and ends at 5pm. Because I couldn't afford to pay for their lunch, they couldn't stay,"" he said. Because his new InStove can keep a meal hot for seven hours, he now cooks dinner late and feeds them from the same pot in the morning, which means two meals for the price of one. Thanks to the stove, he can afford to send them all to school. The orphanage is also stretching their fuel budget twice as far, and significantly reducing their household's carbon footprint. ""Pastor Jonah is currently building a school, and is planning to install more InStoves in the kitchen later this year,"" said Colgan. ""His new stoves are aboard a container scheduled to arrive in Kampala in May.""Less firewood also means less smoke emission, which can be harmful for the cooks. Marcela Boclande, who just gave birth to a son, Jose, is the cook in the Tudisha Bana Bimpe Nutrition Center (the name means ""let's feed the children well). Like many African woman, she will be bringing her baby to work with her, tied to her back. Thanks to their new InStove, she says, she won't have to cook over an unsafe stove that exposes her and Jose to smoke and fire, putting themselves at risk of eye, lung, heart disease and burns.""There is so much less smoke to breathe today,"" she said. ""I am happy that the kitchen will be cleaner for Jose.""Deborah Akot, also a school cook in South Sudan, currently lives in a conflict area on less than $5 a month. She was so grateful for her InStove that she presented Fred with her bible, her only possession.""The stove allows me to live without worry about burning my legs and feet,"" she said. Because the stove can be used indoors, it provides another added benefit to women who use it.In Haiti, it's dangerous for women to cook outdoors; it puts them at risk of gender-based violence, abduction and murder. Cooking inside, however, is usually not possible when you have to cook over a fire. Earlier this year, an InStove was delivered to a Haitian cook named Evane Montpremier, who told Fred that she prays in gratitude for the people who made the InStove she received because now she can cook indoors.""It protects me so I don't have to go outside when it is dark. I finally feel safe,"" she said. ""I'm going to pray for the people who made this stove."""

6,BUSINESS,The Lemon That Is Lululemon,"Suneal Bedi, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-lemon-that-is-lululemon_b_5187083.html,Lululemon's comments can and likely do cause negative social effects by creating a concept of the ideal fit female body as one that only can fit comfortably into its pants. It should begin to impose on itself an extra duty to be socially responsible.,2014-04-22,"MIAMI BEACH, FL - DECEMBER 10: Paula Walker participates in a yoga class while dressed in Lululemon Athletica yoga clothes at the Green Monkey yoga studio on December 10, 2013 in Miami Beach, Florida. Lululemon Athletica, Inc. announced today that it is naming Laurent Potdevin as their new chief executive and said founder Chip Wilson will step down as chairman. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30b921f0000250123bda5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"2013 was a big and controversial year for Lululemon Athletica. Its former CEO, Chip Wilson, speaking on behalf of the company, was quoted as saying that ""[Lululemon pants] don't work for some women's bodies... it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."" Although not explicitly admitting to this, many felt that Wilson was implying that the pants were not meant for girls with certain body types. This created a huge backlash and an abundance of criticism for not only Wilson's comment, but also Lululemon's practices of hiring employees, their firm culture and their distribution and supply of women's plus sizes in their stores. But does this mean that Lululemon misbehaved? Did Lululemon breach some duty that they might owe to the public?  We impose one real obligation or duty on a company, and it's a legal one. The main tenet of corporate law is that a company must maximize the profits of the shareholders of the company. The reality is though maximizing profit is not a science and it can be construed very broadly. Wilson and Lululemon can easily say that they made those comments in order to maximize profits -- and the thing is, they could be right! The comments about body type and firm culture could actually increase profits. But even if they didn't, as long as a company claims its underlying intention is to maximize profits, there is little it can do wrong.  But should we be imposing another type of obligation on certain companies that goes beyond the profit maximization mentality? The short answer is yes.  The reality is that some companies, because of their situation (their size, their popularity, their products, etc.), become authorities on certain social issues, and as such actually have the power to mold, skew and build public perception of these issues. These select companies should take into consideration their power to influence consumers, and hence should have an obligation to responsibly make comments and carry out their businesses.  Take first an example of companies that don't have such power. Chik-Fil-A has been criticized for making anti-gay statements publicly. There shouldn't be however an obligation or responsibility on the company to scrutinize their comments on gay rights. These companies are not authorities on civil rights issues. Chik-Fil-A is an authority on fast food and chicken. Although Lululemon is also not an authority on civil rights, it has arguably become an authority on fitness, fashion and beauty. Given its prevalence in malls, yoga studios, the gym and online, it can be easily seen how Lululemon can persuade and skew public perception of fitness, fashion and beauty. Lululemon can set the standard for what a fit attractive yoga practitioner looks like. It had, after all, the third most retail sales per store in the US in 2012 (Apple and Tiffany & Co. being the other two). It is this power that Lululemon has garnished (albeit a sign of success for the brand) that makes us so rightfully critical and quick to baulk at Wilson's comments and the company's actions.In effect, companies that wield this type of power create a type of social externality that is not accounted for on their balance sheets. An externality is an economic concept for a cost or benefit that a producer creates but does not necessarily bear or internalize. Socially powerful companies can create social costs or social benefits simply by how they speak or behave publicly, because they have the power to influence public opinion. And these costs or benefits sometimes don't directly have an effect on the profits of the company.  Some argue that the effects of socially powerful companies' comments and actions are sometimes translated into market responses. For example, if a clothing company were to say, ""we don't want little people wearing our clothes"" we might expect a market backlash that would effectively punish them -- people might boycott their products and the company would lose large amounts of revenue.  But what happened to Lululemon's stock price after Wilson made his comments? As a matter of fact, within about 10 days after Wilson's comments, Lululemon's stock dropped almost 5 percent, but only a week later, it rose to its pre-Wilson comment levels. A simple 10-day drop in prices doesn't seem like an effective type of market discipline.  Lululemon's comments can and likely do cause negative social effects by creating a concept of the ideal fit female body as one that only can fit comfortably into its pants. Many have cited CrossFit advertising as having a positive social effect because of their message that women who are of a muscular build are also sexy. The reality is that much of these effects are not translated into dollars for the companies and hence they don't necessarily care about how their actions affect social issues.  Although trite, it's true: companies that have this power should have a responsibility and duty to use it wisely. Current laws provide no sanction and no means of regulation on the actions and comments of socially powerful companies. As a matter of fact, First Amendment laws exist to protect this exact type of speech from government sanction. Instead, what we need is a type of internal-self regulation of these companies. CEOs, CFOs, employees and other agents of these companies must begin to understand and recognize that their actions effect how we view certain social issues. They should begin to impose on themselves an extra duty to be socially responsible. And therefore, they should be more sensitive and cognizant of how they market, design, produce their products and run their businesses.  Suneal Bed is a graduate of Harvard Law School."
