Barnard joins the University of San Diego and Purchase College, part of the State University of New York system, as one of the most recent institutions to come under review by the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights. The agency is now conducting 97 investigations at 94 colleges and universities over concerns that the schools violated the gender equity law Title IX in their handling of sexual violence cases.OCR began an investigation of Barnard on Dec. 29, 2014. The school, officially known as Barnard College of Columbia University, is an undergraduate school affiliated with the New York-based Ivy League institution.A group of students filed a federal complaint last year alleging that Columbia mishandled a number of disability cases, as well as cases involving sexual assault and harassment on campus. The complaint has received national attention, due in part to one of the complainants, Emma Sulkowicz, carrying a mattress around campus for months in protest of what she calls the school's mishandling of her alleged rape.Since then, students involved in the complaint tell The Huffington Post, the Education Department has divided the complaint in two, with one complaint focusing on Barnard and another on Columbia's four main undergraduate and graduate colleges. Students say the Education Department has yet to determine whether it will investigate Columbia as a whole or not.Department officials have declined to discuss the specifics of what prompted any of the investigations or how the Department is handling any complaints it's received.""Barnard does not tolerate violence or discrimination of any kind, and we are deeply committed to maintaining a campus environment that is safe for every member of our community,"" Amy Zavadil, Barnard's associate dean for equity and Title IX coordinator, told HuffPost in a statement. ""Senior administrators are carefully reviewing the OCR inquiry and will respond in accordance with applicable law, and in a manner consistent with our own core values as an institution. As this is an ongoing matter, it would be premature to comment any further at this time.""Investigations of this type focus on whether a school has violated the gender equity law Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. Due to court precedent and federal interpretation, the law also covers sexual harassment and assault, and colleges must respond to reports of sexual misconduct whether or not a criminal investigation is initiated. OCR concluded that six of the institutions it investigated had violated Title IX in 2014. Each investigation resulted in a mandatory overhaul of school policy in handling such cases. Princeton University was also required to reimburse tuition costs for three sexual assault victims. The SUNY Purchase review launched on Monday, making it the first case to be opened for investigation in the new year. However, school officials declined to comment, saying they have not yet been notified of the federal inquiry. The University of San Diego, which came under federal scrutiny on Dec. 22, 2014, confirmed its investigation was due to a student's complaint. USD declined to comment further.

Not only were there the economic consequences of a ruinously expensive war, the horrendous death total and the even greater number of wounded, but the very war itself raised doubts about the legitimacy of the old order and the relationships that under laid it.Women, for the first time, joined the industrial labor force in unprecedented numbers. Their role was to replace the men fighting on the front lines, and to maintain the production of the stream of war materials needed by the troops. Having done their part to win the war, the women's suffrage movement would take on a new strength and purpose that would ultimately result in the granting of women's suffrage in most of the developed world.Great Britain and France would draw heavily on their colonial subjects for manpower during the war. French colonial regiments fought at Verdun, and in every major French engagement on the Western Front. Empire troops, and especially the Indian Army, saw service from the trenches of Flanders to the deserts of Persia and Mesopotamia. Having watched their comrades die in defense of European liberty, those colonial soldiers would invariably pose the question, ""what of our own liberty?"" A question made all the more pressing when Woodrow Wilson would declare, in his Fourteen Points, ""a people's right to self-determination."" The Nine European Sovereigns at the Funeral of Edward VII, Windsor Castle, 1910Throughout the length of Europe, national patriotism was increasingly tempered by the realization that it was the reigning elites, their decisions and actions that ultimately would have to shoulder the responsibility for precipitating the catastrophe of the war. By what right did the old order rule? Judging by the war and its outcome, certainly not because of their wisdom, experience or prudence.As the legitimacy of the old order came into question, the bonds of subservience and obligation that had supported it steadily unraveled. There was no way that the divine rights of emperors and tsars could be reconciled with the rights of the workingman. One would have to go. Four imperial dynasties would vanish in the wake of the war. The world would never be the same.Russia: The Fall of the House of RomanovIn August 1914, the command of all the Imperial Armies was placed in the hands of the Grand Duke Nicholas, the Tsar's second cousin. He was a professional soldier and was considered an able commander. Many of the generals under his command, however, were both scheming and incompetent. His troops were untrained and mostly illiterate. The army was chronically short of guns and ammunition. There was no motorized transport beyond approximately 680 cars reserved for the use of senior officers. There were two ambulances in the entire Russian army to transport the wounded.  Tsar Nicholas II with Alexandria and Their ChildrenEnsconced in the royal palace in Petrograd, the newly renamed St. Petersburg, Tsar Nicholas II and his family were almost completely out of touch with ordinary Russians. Cocooned and isolated within the royal court, they were oblivious to the enormous cost being inflicted by the war. The couple had five children, four girls and a boy. The Tsarina Alexandra was extremely unpopular, loathed by many Russians because of her Germanic origins. Tragically the heir to the throne, the Tsarevich Alexei, was a hemophiliac and was subject to uncontrollable internal bleeding after even the slightest fall or bruise. Desperate to find a means for dealing with her son's hemophilia, the Tsarina had fallen progressively under the malign influence of a purported holy man from Siberia.  Political Cartoon Criticizing Rasputin's Manipulation of the Russian Royal FamilyGrigori Rasputin has been variously described as a psychic, a mystic, and the ""mad Siberian monk."" What is certain is that he had a near hypnotic influence on the Tsarina and that he became a divisive figure in the royal household. He was able, through manipulation of the Tsarina, to influence government promotions and appointments as well as the policy of the war.In late December of 1916, concerned by the damage wrought by Rasputin on the royal family, the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, a cousin of the Tsar, and Prince Felix Yusupov decided to murder him. Despite being fed cakes and wine laced with enough cyanide to kill five men and being shot, it is possible that Rasputin was still alive when the conspirators threw his body into the freezing Neva River in Petrograd. They were arrested, although never tried, but by then the damage to the reputation of the royal family had been done.In late 1915, Nicholas dismissed his cousin and took over operational control of the army himself. With no military training or command experience, it was a role he was completely unfit for. The Tsar, moreover, seemed oblivious to the increasingly desperate economic situation. At the start of the war, Russia's economy ranked the fifth largest in the world and its rate of growth was the highest in Europe. The onset of war had initially provided an additional growth spurt, but the economy soon began to steadily deteriorate. The combination of growing shortages of essential goods and successive military defeats were causing Russia's social fabric to begin to unravel. Within the next 12 months it would completely fall apart."

(Photo by Edson Hong)Yoga is a universal language. It has no color or religion.So why is the face of yoga in the U.S. always a thin flexible white American woman?Is it that people of color and men don't practice yoga? Or do they practice but don't want to talk about it?I was born and raised in India, where it's common for two to three generations to live together under one roof. Most kids grow up watching their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles practicing meditation, breath work or chanting first thing in the morning. They also burn incense and light oil lamps to clear out negative energies from the night and welcome the new day (known as ""Bhakti Yoga""). Many elders will visit the temple on their way to work each day, and feed the homeless sitting outside the temple (known as ""Karma Yoga""). As the day progresses, the elders of the family spend time with the kids, narrating yogic mythological stories meant to be inspiring, soul-stirring, and rich with multiple layers of meaning (known as ""Jnana Yoga"").The physical practice of yoga (known as ""Asana Yoga"") is similar to what we see in American yoga classes. Asana is traditionally performed mostly by men, with women participating more in group satsang (meditating on scriptures) and chanting -- so it's not surprising that most celebrated Indian yoga gurus are males.A priest in Varanasi leads women in a class on Hindu scripture. (Photo by Jorge Royan)For most Indians, yoga is not an exercise or something you do in a class. It is an entire lifestyle -- a practice that is tied into many aspects of one's daily routine.When I moved to Chicago in 2004, my first experience of American yoga was overwhelming -- in a good way.When I inquired about yoga in the U.S. the first question was 'well, what type of yoga you are looking for.'I'd stumbled into a multi-million dollar industry with no resemblance to the traditional yoga that I knew. The hot power studio I tried resembled a spa with fully equipped showers and supplies. The reception area had refreshments, comfy couches and Zen music. The yoga room had dim lights, with incense burning, an American singer named Krishna Das singing Indian Vedic chants on Pandora for a class full of beautiful women, wearing sleek yoga clothes which could easily pass off as club wear.I was in awe. Here was this entire world of yoga that I didn't even know existed. It was beyond fascinating and I was in love with every aspect of it.In my first year of practice, I must have taken over 200 group yoga classes. I started noticing a few small things all these classes had in common, regardless of location, time, or style of studio. Ninety percent of the time I was the only person of color. I also noticed that barely five percent of the participants were male.But maybe the most surprising difference was that the yoga practice was predominantly physical. I loved how physically demanding the hour was, but I missed the philosophical aspects of yoga. Somehow it felt incomplete. When there were small bits of chanting in Sanskrit introduced, I wondered whether the students or the teachers really understood what the chants meant or why they were doing them.After a year of dedicated practice, I joined a 200 hour level 1 certification. The training was a life-changing experience for me at many levels.The more I learned about yoga, the more I realized that how many things that I had experienced growing up in India were a part of it -- I just hadn't know that it was called yoga.An early morning yoga class on the banks of the Ganges in Varanasi, India. (Photo by Nakatani Yoshifumi)I looked forward to the asana training days. I enjoyed learning about the anatomy and benefits. But the sessions on Sanskrit, history of yoga and philosophy were very disappointing. The teachers were not experts in this aspect of yoga, and most of what they taught seemed to be fresh from a google search.Worse yet, I learned that even though I considered myself an American, I wasn't perceived as one. Anytime I raised a question about something I didn't think was being presented correctly, or if I wanted to assist the class to provide a correct pronunciation of Sanskrit chants or words, it was treated as an unwelcome interruption.For example, during one of the yoga philosophy sessions, the teacher summed up the Bhagavad Gita (Hindu equivalent to the Bible) in one sentence ""Arjuna killed his brothers to follow his Dharma (which means duty in Sanskrit).""When I raised my concern that this was a vast oversimplification and that the students deserved more context, I was immediately shut down for the lack of time.Some fellow students caught me after class and reassured me that they appreciated my contribution and a few of us met after training hours and talked in detail about the content and context of the Hindu scriptures.This incident upset me at some level, but the love for yoga and affection of other students kept me in the program.But the problems continued. Toward the end of my two months of training my mentor told me that if I wanted to be a teacher, I needed to change my intensity towards yoga. She suggested I should be more causal and peppy (sort of a cheerleader when leading a group class). When I didn't understand what she was trying to say, she put it more bluntly:""Sweta, when you walk in a yoga studio, people perceive you as an authority on yoga. You need to focus more on making the physical asanas fun, and less on the philosophy.""It was the first time someone had reminded me that, as a person of color teaching yoga, I was going to be perceived differently.I tried not to take it to heart. Overall, the training connected me to my roots and I had found my purpose. All I wanted to do was to share the gifts of yoga.So I started teaching at studios, and over the course of one year I had built up an amazing following of students which included a few men and people of color. My classes were tailored to provide a holistic yoga experience. It was not a religious practice. I just wanted to share the knowledge and provide an avenue for students interested in the broader aspects of yoga. But the management of the yoga studios were not really happy with my approach. I often got feedback from them that I should focus more on the asanas and the physical aspects.This conflict got me thinking what yoga truly is!The questions took me back to Northern India, where I travelled for months, living the ashram life, learning more about traditional yoga and working to understanding yoga philosophy.The author, Sweta Saraogi, in Anjaneyasana, or Crescent Pose, at a temple in Hyderabad, India. (Courtesy photo)When I came back to the U.S., I decided to approach some of the more ""authentic studios"" with the idea of teaching classes geared more toward yoga philosophy.Some of them balked, warning me that it would sound like I was preaching Hinduism. Why was I shut down? Was it my color that made the yoga studios react the way they did? Or are Americans really only interested in the physical asana practice?When I moved to Seattle, I had similar interactions. Even though Seattle has a larger yoga community, I noticed similar demographics in the studios. And the majority of studios were still only interested in the physical aspects of yoga.Inspired by the start-up scene, I decided to launch a private practice that catered to individuals who want to practice the broader aspects of yoga. This is my way of raising yoga awareness, and of creating a safe space where everyone feels welcome, irrespective of color, background, age or physical fitness level.My students now include men and women of all shapes and sizes from all over the world. Most of them are people who prefer not to practice at a regular yoga studio because they feel intimidated in the environment of super flexible and highly athletic yogis, or don't enjoy the practice just because of its intensity of physical postures.America has done a great job of bringing yoga alive. No other country, including India, has embraced yoga to this extent.But why is American yoga mainly limited to the physical asanas? Why is the discussion of yoga philosophy limited to a small number of studios? Why is the face of yoga always thin white American women doing the craziest yoga poses? Why don't we ever see pictures of men, women of color, and students enjoying mediation or breath work?Are we creating an environment where others don't feel welcome or feel intimidated?Yoga should not be limited to individuals who were born flexible. Quite the opposite! Those who find the physical aspects of yoga the hardest are the ones who benefit from it most. What can we do to make them feel more welcome?In my opinion, by sharing the broader aspects of yoga like Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga, we can transform the image of yoga from what it is today -- a competitive sport -- to a holistic path of self-realization, and thus open the door to people of varied demographics to practice yoga.This article was initially published on The Seattle Globalist"

They also burn incense and light oil lamps to clear out negative energies from the night and welcome the new day (known as ""Bhakti Yoga""). Many elders will visit the temple on their way to work each day, and feed the homeless sitting outside the temple (known as ""Karma Yoga""). As the day progresses, the elders of the family spend time with the kids, narrating yogic mythological stories meant to be inspiring, soul-stirring, and rich with multiple layers of meaning (known as ""Jnana Yoga"").The physical practice of yoga (known as ""Asana Yoga"") is similar to what we see in American yoga classes. Asana is traditionally performed mostly by men, with women participating more in group satsang (meditating on scriptures) and chanting -- so it's not surprising that most celebrated Indian yoga gurus are males.A priest in Varanasi leads women in a class on Hindu scripture.

It is an entire lifestyle -- a practice that is tied into many aspects of one's daily routine.When I moved to Chicago in 2004, my first experience of American yoga was overwhelming -- in a good way.When I inquired about yoga in the U.S. the first question was 'well, what type of yoga you are looking for.'I'd stumbled into a multi-million dollar industry with no resemblance to the traditional yoga that I knew. The hot power studio I tried resembled a spa with fully equipped showers and supplies. The reception area had refreshments, comfy couches and Zen music.

It was beyond fascinating and I was in love with every aspect of it.In my first year of practice, I must have taken over 200 group yoga classes.

7,WORLDPOST,Law and Disorder in the South China Sea,"Richard Javad Heydarian, ContributorAcademic, policy adviser, and author of ""Asia's New Battlefiel...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philippines-vs-china_b_6386216.html,"Owing to its glaring conventional military inferiority, the Philippines has embarked on an unprecedented journey: Launching a legal warfare, dubbed as ""lawfare,"" against China.",2015-01-07,File:South China Sea location map.svg for country borders (CC-BY-SA-3.0-DE) by NordNordWest/Wikipedia | File:South China Sea location map. ... ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc142f6230000380093e410.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Generalizations about Asian cultures are often misleading, if not despicably orientalist. But I would dare to say that the Philippines is a nation of lawyers, while China is a nation of strategists and business-minded leaders. And this partly explains how the two countries approach the South China Sea disputes. Owing to its glaring conventional military inferiority, the Philippines has embarked on an unprecedented journey: Launching a legal warfare, dubbed as ""lawfare,"" against China. Manila hopes to leverage international law to rein in China's relentless push across disputed waters in the South China Sea. In a nation of lawyers, the local media has tirelessly sought the views and analysis of lawyers rather than military strategists and foreign affairs experts, who may have a better grasp of the realities on the ground.In the public sphere, there is minimal discussion of the intricacies of Chinese political system, the advent of popular nationalism and its impact on foreign policy, and complex decision-making processes that determine Beijing's territorial policy. Often, panel discussions among experts boil down to the various articles of the UNCLOS and the arbitration proceedings in The Hague. The upper-echelons of the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is also dominated by legal strategists. Leading geopolitical experts are often ignored. Astonishingly, the Philippines' Department of Defense (DOD) recently postponed the refurbishment of its facilities on the Thitu (Pag-Asa to Filipinos) island, which is among the most prized features in the South China Sea, in order to supposedly maintain Manila's ""moral high ground"" amid the arbitration proceedings against China. In many ways, lawfare is the name of the game in the Philippines. Discussions on pro-active diplomacy and military modernization often take the backseat. Meanwhile, China has combined diplomatic charm-offensive, anchored by multi-billion trade and investment deals across the Asia-Pacific theatre, with ruthless military strategy, featuring massive construction projects and para-military patrols across disputed waters. So far, China has astutely used economic incentives and diplomatic acrobatics to dispel any form of unity among Southeast Asia countries on the South China Sea disputes. It remains to be seen whether China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can even agree on the guidelines of a Code of Conduct (CoC) across disputed waters anytime soon.The question therefore is: Does this mean that the Philippines did the right thing by resorting to compulsory arbitration against China? A Historic Battle The month of December has been particularly eventful. China, the U.S. and Vietnam have all expressed their position on the legal aspects of the maritime spats in the South China Sea. And China has officially boycotted the arbitration proceedings by refusing to submit a counter-memorial to the Arbitral Tribunal in The Hague before the December 15 deadline. China reiterated its outright opposition to any form of third party arbitration vis-a-vis sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea by releasing a position paper on Dec 7, which contains three major arguments. First, Beijing contends that the special arbitral tribunal at The Hague, where the Philippines filed a memorial earlier this year, has no jurisdiction over the issue, since the UNCLOS does not accord it the mandate to address what are essentially sovereignty-related issues. Although China is a signatory to treaty, it has exercised its right (under Article 298) to absolve itself of any compulsory arbitration (under Article 287 and Annex VII) over territorial delimitation issues, among other things.Second, China maintains that, based on supposed ""historical rights,"" it exercises ""inherent and indisputable"" sovereignty over the disputed features, including those that fall well within the Philippines' 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).Third, Beijing asserts that the Philippines violated prior bilateral and multilateral agreements (that is, the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, known as the DoC) by initiating a compulsory arbitration procedure under UNCLOS. Interestingly, the position paper was released a week before the Monday deadline for China to submit its formal position, or defence, to the arbitral tribunal. The Philippines, in response, maintains that it is China that has violated the DoC by unilaterally altering the status quo through expansive construction activities, widening paramilitary patrols and coercive behavior within the South-east Asian country's EEZ, specifically in the Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and, more recently, in the Second Thomas Shoal.The Philippines also maintains that the arbitral tribunal has the mandate to interpret the parameters of China's right to opt out of compulsory arbitration procedures. For the Philippines, its legal case is perfectly consistent with the mandate of the arbitration body, since its memorial focuses on whether China's notorious ""nine-dashed-line"" claim is consistent with international law, and the determination of the nature of disputed features (under Article 121) --specifically, whether they can be appropriated or occupied and generate their own respective territorial waters.Joining the Fray  While the US does not take a position on the sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, it has indirectly supported the Philippines by supporting the resolution of the disputes in accordance with international law as well as questioning the validity of China's claims.The US State Department's position paper, released on Dec. 5, has raised issues with the ""nine-dashed-line"" doctrine, arguing that China's expansive claims lack precision and consistency.After all, China has not unambiguously specified the exact coordinates of its territorial claims. It is not clear whether China claims much of the South China Sea, treating it as a virtual internal lake, or simply claims the land features in the area and their surrounding waters per se. The US, similar to most independent legal experts, also maintains that China's claim to historical rights over the South China Sea waters is not consistent with international law. China has neither exercised continuous and uncontested sovereignty over the area, nor does the South China Sea -- an artery of global trade, connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans -- constitute a bay or any form of near-coastal water that can be appropriated based on historical rights-related claims. In short, China's claims far exceed -- if not entirely contradict -- modern international law, specifically UNCLOS. Although the US is not a signatory to treaty, it has observed the international convention in its naval operations.To the surprise of many observers, Vietnam joined the fray by submitting a position paper to the arbitral tribunal in The Hague last Friday, which contains three main points: It expressed its support for the Philippines' case; questioned the ""nine-dashed-line"" doctrine; and asked the arbitral tribunal to give due regard to Vietnam's rights and interests. Vietnam's maneuver will most likely have no significant impact on the pending legal case between the Philippines and China, but it carries significant political implications.In recent months, Vietnam has been engaged in a sustained diplomatic effort to normalize relations with China and prevent another crisis in the disputed areas, especially in the light of the oil rig crisis in the South China Sea this year, which sparked huge protests in Vietnam and placed the two countries on the verge of armed confrontation. Vietnam's bold threat to join the Philippines' legal efforts against China carries the risk of renewed tensions in the South China Sea and of undermining tenuous, but critical, diplomatic channels between Hanoi and Beijing.It seems, however, that Vietnam is hedging its bets by dangling the threat of joining a common legal front against China as a form of deterrence against further provocations in the future.With both the Philippines and the US explicitly questioning China's expansive claims in recent months, Vietnam perhaps felt compelled to reiterate its position on the issue and underline its right to resort to existing international legal instruments to address potentially explosive territorial disputes.A Pyrrhic War? Nonetheless, despite the unanimity of opinion and statements by Filipino, Vietnamese and American officials on the legal dimensions of China's claims in the South China Sea, it is far from clear whether Beijing will re-consider its policy in adjacent waters. Ultimately, China could respond to growing international pressure by hardening its position. It can accelerate efforts at consolidating its claims on the ground, vehemently reject any unfavorable arbitration outcome as an affront to its national integrity, and impose sanctions on and/or diplomatically isolate the Philippines as a form of reprisal. After all, there are no existing compliance-enforcement mechanisms to compel China to act contrary to its position and interests.Beyond sovereignty claims, the very credibility of international law is also at stake. As Columbia University Professor Matthew C. Waxman succintly puts it, ""For the UNCLOS system -- as a body of rules and binding dispute settlement mechanisms -- prominence and credibility are at stake. A decision that the arbitral panel has jurisdiction,"" could put the arbitration body at the risk of ""being ignored, derided and marginalized by the biggest player in the region."" In the end, there may be no clear winners. An original version of this piece was printed on the Straits Times. "

To get you started, here are six easy ways to nourish yourself today.",2015-01-07,Decline in hands. A sunset on a background of the lifted female hands,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e7b502000004e00fe619b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One thing we, as mom and daughter, have learned the hard way: women cannot afford to put off self-care until 'life eases up,' 'the toddlers are in school,' 'the kids leave for college' or 'we're through the crisis at hand.' It was precisely in the moments of complete overwhelm that we realized if we did not start practicing nourishing routines, we would sink.-- Becky Johnson and Rachel Randolph, Nourished: A Search for Help, Happiness and a Full Night's Sleep.Do you dream of living a more nourishing life? This was my dream too, and now it is more of a reality than ever. It begin with asking myself a simple question, whether my day was a delight or a disaster. ""What do I need to nourish myself right now?"" Then I quietly waited for the answer to come. It always did. Sometimes I heard, ""Take a nap."" Other times I thought to myself, ""Eat a little protein."" Or ""take a hot bath,"" or ""sit in the sun,"" or ""organize just this one drawer,"" ""call a friend for lunch,"" or ""pray and release this to God."" It is amazing how well we know ourselves when we simply pause on a regular basis to ask, ""What do I need? What would nourish me now?""  To get you started, here are six easy ways to nourish yourself today.1. Create a Nourishing Space. When your space is serene, your mind begins to relax as well. Begin by getting one room in your house ""close up-ready"" - as if it were going to be photographed in a magazine. For now, don't worry about organizing drawers or closets, just get it surface clean, uncluttered and pretty. Having a nourishing sanctuary to retreat to immediately calms and lifts our moods.2. Organize Your Week into ""Work Days,"" ""Stuff Days"" and ""Off Days.""  Give each day of your week a major focus: one day to accomplish work-related tasks; another to handle ""stuff"" such as errands, doctor appointments, buying groceries, calling the plumber, paying bills, etc. Finally schedule at least one (or two!) free days where you put away the To-Do List and play or rest.  3. Love The Body You're In.  Before going on yet another diet or exercise plan, try loving the body you currently occupy. ""For an instant pick-me-up, Google your body type and then add the words 'beautiful' and 'fashion' and you will see a gorgeous array of women who look like you, decked out in styles that bring out their va-va-voom."" I made a Pinterest board and call it, ""Beauty in My Body Type."" I pin clothes, make-up, scarves, jewelry and beautiful people who own their curves and their age and looked marvelous and glowing... as is. 4. Make a Menu.  Take the time to plan a menu and stock the groceries to make the meals ahead of time every week. Tack the menu on the fridge. We call this ""being kind to your future self."" It is amazing how much time and headache you'll save all week by spending 30 minutes on Sunday and scribble out simple, nourishing meals to make through the week.  5. Get Your Move On, Naturally.  I hate the word ""exercise"" and so I call it ""enthusiastic movement"" instead. Even so, I still resort to bribing myself to get my body off the couch. One way to coax yourself into moving is to pair an activity with something else you enjoy. Walk on the treadmill to a favorite book or TV show. (I usually watch The Food Network, but we'll analyze that another time.) Or promise yourself a post-exercise treat: perhaps a guilt-free nap, browsing at a vintage shop or a drink at a cozy coffee shop. Fun activities (for me, anyway) like decorating a room, cooking a big meal for others, gardening, or trying on lots of clothes use calories and energy. Try to incorporate a naturally fun, high-movement activity into some part of each day.6. Nourish Your Mind.  Think of your mind as your own ""Secret Garden"" that requires regular weeding, planting and watering. Be picky about thoughts you allow to take root and bloom in your head. Try this simple trick for weeding out negativity and planting more joy. First, notice what kind of mood you are in right now. For example, are you feeling anxious? Follow that mood to the exact thought that is causing your anxiety (because all moods begin with thoughts). Now examine that thought, turn it around in your mind. Is there another thought that is just as true, but more positive and helpful you could plant instead?

""When [de Blasio] attacks the New York City police department, he’s attacking his own department and his own policies,"" Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association, said on NPR's All Things Considered. ""If the policy is wrong then change it. We’ll follow our orders and effectively police that policy. But when he criticizes his department, he’s criticizing his own policy.”Lynch and de Blasio have been at odds since officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were killed in an ambush in Brooklyn last month. The spat came into view when Lynch said the mayor had ""blood on [his] hands"" for making statements that Lynch said bred animosity against police. De Blasio, in turn, has said police were disrespectful for turning their backs to him while he spoke at the cops' funerals. De Blasio is producing friction between the police department and New Yorkers too, according to Lynch. ""City Hall is creating a climate where every interaction with police officers turns into a confrontation,” Lynch said in the interview.To patch up their rift, Lynch said it would go ""a long way"" if de Blasio apologized to officers. He also again refused to criticize the officers for the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island. Garner was put in a chokehold after refusing to cooperate with police who allegedly found him selling untaxed cigarettes. Lynch blamed Garner for his own death. ""You cannot resist arrest because resisting arrest leads to confrontation,"" Lynch said. ""Unfortunately, it leads to tragedy and that’s exactly what happened on that corner that day. We cannot send our police officers out to do the job and then not support them when something doesn’t go exactly by script.” Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact The Author"

13,POLITICS,Dems Maneuver to Curb CEO Pay Loophole,"Sarah Anderson, ContributorInstitute for Policy Studies",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dems-maneuver-to-curb-ceo_b_6426306.html,"Right out of the blocks, House Democrats are pushing a tax reform in the 114th Congress that tackles the extreme gaps between CEO and worker pay.

Hollen talked federal budget priorities and methods to achieve them.

The ""CEO/Employee Pay Fairness Act"" would deny corporate tax deductions for executive compensation over $1 million -- unless they raise salaries for lower-level workers to keep pace with cost of living and labor productivity increases. Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) authored the bill.In a letter to colleagues, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the bill would ""help ensure that workers share in the fruit of their productivity.""According to Politico, the bill could be voted on through a procedure known as a Motion to Recommit on January 8, when the House is expected to consider legislation to approve the Keystone pipeline. The Republican majority is sure to shoot down the motion, but the maneuver gives Democrats an opportunity to draw attention to their priorities for the new session. The ""CEO/Employee Pay Fairness Act"" is just the latest move to address a massive loophole in the tax code that encourages excessive executive compensation. A 1993 amendment to the tax code caps the total executive pay corporations can deduct off their taxes at no more than $1 million -- unless the pay is so-called ""performance"" pay. Thanks to this loophole, corporations can simply declare the stock-based rewards they lavish on executives ""performance-based"" and then go on to deduct the many millions involved as a basic business expense. The more they pay their CEO, the less they pay in taxes. There have been several efforts to close the perverse loophole for all corporations -- with no exceptions for those handing out employee raises. In the last session, Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced the Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act (S. 1476), legislation that would keep the $1 million deductibility cap but remove the ""performance pay"" loophole. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) introduced a companion bill (H.R. 3970) in the U.S. House of Representatives. These bills would save taxpayers $50 billion over 10 years. Patty Murray (D-WA), then Senate Budget Committee Chair, introduced a similar bill (S. 2162) that would use the stricter deductibility limits to pay for expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. These reforms would build on a provision in Obamacare that eliminated the ""performance pay"" loophole for health insurance companies. An Institute for Policy Studies report calculated that this reform generated at least $72 million in additional public revenue last year from America's 10 largest publicly held health insurance companies. In deciding to lift up this bill in the first week of the session, Democrats no doubt took note of polls showing public support for ending perverse incentives for excessive executive pay. A Hart Research Associates poll, for example, showed 63 percent of Americans want to ""Prevent corporations from avoiding taxes when they award their executives millions of dollars in stock options."" While the Dems have next to no chance of prevailing this week, their maneuver will raise awareness of a CEO pay loophole so outrageous it will be hard for Republicans to defend indefinitely."

He wasn't a bad guy, but it was a very bad relationship for me that left me feeling trapped. At a time in my life when that should have been carefree and fun, I was miserable.I cried myself to sleep way too often.So why did I stay in a situation that I knew was wrong, that was making me sick and unhappy? Because at the time, I was naïve and craved that stability and safety. Even if it wasn't ideal, it was something that I could depend on. I would finish college, get married, have financial stability and the ""normal"" that we're told we need to achieve.When we finally broke up, I was devastated. I mean, I was ""cry your eyes out the world is going to end"" devastated but not for the obvious reasons. It wasn't that I was going to necessarily miss him as a person, but rather that the stable future I thought I could depend on was gone.I panicked. I cried. I did the normal 20-year-old freaking out thing.But you know what happened? In less than a week, I woke up and everything was fine. In fact, it was awesome. For the first time I had the freedom to do what I wanted when I wanted. I got a job as a cocktail waitress and had the best summer of my life, making new friends and doing things that made me happy -- for me. It took losing who I thought I had to become to finally learn who I was -- as much as you can know at age 21.What does that have to do with me now?Friday I lost my job.I'm still a little in shock and I'm sure it hasn't completely sunk in yet, but the enormity of the situation is obvious. My benefits run out at the end of the month and I have to apply for unemployment all while trying to pay my mortgage, bills, etc. all on my own. That's huge. Enter panic and ""oh my god the world is going to end"" initial reaction.But while you don't need to know the details, I will tell you that the situation was not healthy and in fact bordered on abusive on several occasions.And I know I was damn good at my job. Hell, two months before I was told I was great and my job was mine as long as I wanted it, which is why this was a surprise (but not unheard of, seeing as they're a small company and more than 20 people had come in and out of that office in six years).But more than external praise, I know how hard I worked and I'm proud of the quality that I produced, the effort that I gave and the way that I conducted myself, despite an unhealthy situation. So while right now I'm trying to decide how to decorate the cardboard box I might end up living in, there's also a small sense of... unfamiliar relief?Although it's still raw, there's a sense that a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and that maybe this is just what I needed to find something that is healthier for me -- physically and mentally. Maybe this will allow me to actually do something that means something to someone other than the only person making the profit.Because much like that relationship mentioned above, I felt stuck in this job, but yet I never left because I didn't know what else I could do even though what I was doing wasn't making me unhappy.So I'm taking this as a sign.If I wasn't going to seek out the respect and fulfillment I deserve, the universe decided it would step in instead and throw a high-speed curve ball at my head. Now I have no choice.That's not to say I'm not scared, that I won't miss my coworkers or that things are going to be easy by any stretch of the imagination. Right now there's a little bit of fear. There's a little bit of panic. But there's also no walking on eggshells. There's no sitting at a desk and counting down the seconds on the clock. With my security stripped, there's also an unfamiliar freedom.Maybe it will take losing who I thought I had to become to finally learn who I am--as much as you can know at age 33.For more, visit www.abbyhasissues.com.ALSO ON HUFFPOST:"
