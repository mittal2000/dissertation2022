Put down the phone."" ""We try to make all our Message Monday signs relevant,"" Tracey Bramble, a spokeswoman at the Iowa DOT, told The Huffington Post.""With the big movie premiere this week ... we asked around the Iowa DOT for suggestions,"" she added. ""While we typically stick to just one message per week that runs from midnight Sunday night to midnight Monday night, this week we had just too many good messages to choose just one.""Bramble said the messages are running in a couple of other states as well. Arizona, Colorado and Utah also signed up to run similarly humorous public safety announcements.The Iowa DOT has a reputation for lighthearted messages.Earlier this year, it riffed on the famous line from ""Dirty Dancing"" -- ""Nobody puts baby in a corner"" -- to remind drivers not to leave children unattended in a car. (The ""Dirty Dancing"" campaign coincided with performances of the play in Des Moines.)And if you prefer ""Star Trek"" to ""Star Wars,"" the Iowa DOT has you covered: Actor George Takei, onetime helmsman of the USS Enterprise, shared one of the department's messages on his Facebook page in October.""Get your head out of your apps,"" it read.

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) campaign for president, on Monday released short clips of their conversation about politics, called ""Killer Mike presents: Talking Shop with Bernie Sanders.""Killer Mike, the Atlanta-based entertainer also known as Michael Render, sat down with Sanders last month for a nearly hour-long conversation on topics ranging from marijuana legalization to Social Security. The rapper endorsed Sanders in June, citing the Vermont senator’s call to restore the Voting Rights Act, which the Supreme Court gutted in 2013. He spoke at a campaign rally for Sanders in Atlanta in November. (The two also ate at a famous local soul food joint.)During last month's meeting, Sanders and Killer Mike taped a discussion about politics at the rapper's barber shop, the SWAG Shop. Killer Mike teased short clips of that conversation Monday afternoon. He plans to release videos of the full conversation on Tuesday via his YouTube and Facebook pages.Killer Mike calls himself a capitalist, while Sanders is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist. Beyond the labels, though, the two found much common ground. For example, they agreed that the federal government shouldn't classify marijuana as an illegal drug in the same category as heroin. ""I'm a marijuana smoker and that is absolute bullshit,"" Killer Mike tells Sanders.They also talked about Donald Trump: And conservative attempts to cut programs like Social Security: "

Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy were planning to hold a press conference in early October to push legislation that would prevent licensed dealers from selling a gun without a completed background check. Their bill was a response to the June shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, that killed nine people in church. The shooter, Dylann Roof, was able to purchase his .45-caliber Glock pistol even though the FBI hadn't finished his background check. Then, Chris Harper Mercer killed 10 people and wounded nine at a community college in Oregon. Blumenthal and Murphy called off the press conference.""We planned to announce it, then the shooting occurred, and we had to postpone it because the perception would have been inappropriate,"" Blumenthal told The Huffington Post. ""We decided that we should be expressing sympathy, which we sincerely felt at the time, rather than advocating a particular policy position.""Any momentum the Democrats' legislation could have picked up from the Charleston shooting was lost, since the guns in the Oregon rampage were purchased legally. The two are familiar with the cycle of massacre followed by no reform: Even after 20 first-graders and six educators were killed in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012, legislation to require background checks for private gun sales failed in the Senate several months later.""One of the problems is that the common question about any proposal is, 'Would that have prevented that tragedy?' -- so there's sort of a mentality or a mindset that proposals have to fit the last mass shooting,"" Blumenthal said. ""But of course the mass shootings continue to occur tragically and unnecessarily. We need to view the issue in totality, to work toward preventing these tragedies whenever and wherever they occur.""In South Carolina, the loophole that Blumenthal and Murphy's legislation would have addressed might well have prevented Roof from obtaining his weapon. At the time Roof was arrested in February on an unrelated matter, he admitted to using drugs illegally. An admission of illegal drug use counts among the factors that disqualifies someone from purchasing a gun from a licensed dealer.But due to various data entry errors and inter-agency miscommunications, the FBI didn't see Roof's arrest record when he set out to buy the Glock pistol. Federal law says that if the FBI is unable to complete a background check within three business days, the gun dealer may complete the transaction, which is what happened in Roof's case.Republicans seized on the news that bureaucratic errors on the part of local law enforcement and the FBI had contributed to Roof's ability to buy a gun, using those failures to divert discussion about giving law enforcement more time to complete a check.""It's disastrous that this bureaucratic mistake prevented existing laws from working and blocking an illegal gun sale,"" Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement at the time. ""The facts undercut attempts to use the tragedy to enact unnecessary gun laws. The American people, and especially the victims' families, deserve better.""Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) rejected that sort of non-response by introducing the Background Check Completion Act. His bill, which would stop retailers from selling guns before the background check is complete, has 49 Democratic cosponsors. Some retailers, including Walmart, already exercise their discretion by waiting for a definitive go-ahead from the FBI before completing a gun sale. Clyburn's bill would make this a required practice for all licensed dealers.""Every time a piece of legislation comes up regarding guns, the first thing Republicans say is, 'Well, that would not have prevented this from happening,'"" Clyburn told HuffPost. ""They cannot argue that fixing the law would not have made a difference -- it would have made a difference. They cannot say that about Charleston.""Roof's ability to buy a firearm despite his record illustrates a broader national problem. According to the FBI, more than 2,500 guns were sold in 2014 to people who should have been barred from purchasing a weapon. Since 2010, the three-day deadline for background checks has let gun retailers proceed with over 15,000 sales to individuals who were later found ineligible to purchase a firearm.The three-day limit, in effect since 1998, was a choice made to appease gun rights advocates and the National Rifle Association. Before the National Instant Criminal Background Check System was implemented that year, the local law enforcement officers who handled background checks had five days to make the call as to the purchaser's eligibility. Now, Justice Department guidelines require NICS reviewers to make an immediate decision in 90 percent of cases.""As the Charleston shooting rampage painfully shows, there are some cases where more time to investigate before a firearm is transferred would mean more lives saved,"" the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence said in a July statement.Recognizing that three days isn't always enough time to complete a background check and that waiting periods can also help prevent impulsive acts of violence, nine states and the District of Columbia require waiting periods for some or all types of gun sales. But other states have decided that waiting periods are unnecessary: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) signed a repeal of his state's 48-hour waiting period just a week after the Charleston shooting.Giving the FBI more time to complete a background check may save some people thinking of suicide. In states that have background check requirements for both licensed and private gun sales, the rate of suicide by gun is lower than the rates of suicide by other means. Roughly 20,000 of the 30,000 people killed by guns in America each year kill themselves.Mark Glaze, former executive director of the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, said that lifting the background check deadline or imposing a waiting period for gun sales could reduce the incidence of suicide. But proponents can't point to a wealth of research supporting that assertion because Congress, backed by the NRA, passed an amendment restricting federal funding for gun-related research in 1996.""It's intuitive, but there's good reason to think that a waiting period will reduce the number of suicides because for many it's an impulsive act. Because of the NRA's bar on research, there isn't a ton of evidence to support what we suspect is true,"" Glaze told HuffPost.A study published this year by professors at Johns Hopkins University found that Connecticut's suicide rate fell after it required licensing for gun purchases in 1995. The study also found that Missouri's suicide rate increased after it repealed a similar law in 2007. Additional research could create more momentum for policy change.A waiting period for gun sales might also prevent more domestic abusers from purchasing guns. Lindsay Nichols, a senior staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, noted that a misdemeanor assault doesn't disqualify someone from buying a gun unless it involved domestic violence, but the record doesn't always indicate which misdemeanors are which.""Very often, a domestic violence abuser is convicted of assault, and the record doesn't say whether it was a domestic assault or not, so it's up to the state to provide information about the case to make that determination,"" Nichols said. ""That can be really difficult and sometimes the information just doesn't get to the FBI in time.""In South Carolina, local gun control advocates are pushing for lengthier and more thorough background checks. They have public opinion on their side: A September poll found that 80 percent of South Carolinians favor legislation requiring that a background check be complete before a would-be gun buyer can take the firearm home.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has included fixing the background check deadline in her package of gun control proposals. But such policy discussions kept getting postponed by mass shooting upon mass shooting. After Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people at a holiday office party in San Bernardino, California, Democrats jumped at the opportunity to attack Republicans over their opposition to legislation introduced by Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) that would prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.The focus on the no-fly list, and away from background checks, is frustrating for Clyburn.""That's what's got me upset more than anything else,"" he said.

4,PARENTS,Mom Who Lost Son At Sandy Hook: We Can't Accept Gun Violence As 'New Normal',Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/three-years-later-newtown-mom-says-its-time-to-stop-accepting-gun-violence-as-new-normal_us_566ec432e4b0e292150e6246,"""I would turn back time in a moment to have my boy back in my arms, but I can't do that.""",2015-12-14,1981: The Attempted Assassination Of President Ronald Reagan,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a8abe1200002d00ad7981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Monday, December 14th, marks three years since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. For Nicole Hockley, it marks three years since she lost her youngest son, Dylan, a first grader she has described as ""pure love,"" with captivating eyes and an infectious giggle who died instantly -- in the arms of a special education assistant who also lost her life trying to protect him.Hockley is one of several parents whose children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary who have joined forces to establish Sandy Hook Promise, a combination of two non-profit corporations with one overarching goal: To mobilize parents, schools and communities to develop gun violence prevention and mental health programs, and to advocate for gun safety laws.We spoke to Hockley on the eve of the third anniversary, while she and her family were spending time with the Barden family -- who lost their son, Daniel, in the shooting as well.Are anniversaries especially difficult for you? Every day is hard. But as you come up to remembrance marks, and certain holidays, birthdays, you almost feel like you're holding your breath -- and then you can breathe again when the day is over. At the three-year mark, I'm in that place. I'm holding my breath and staying very busy, thinking, I just need to get through one day again, and then I'll get back to work.We, at Sandy Hook Promise, go very quiet around the remembrance marks. We do a lot of pre-recorded interviews, but then we start shutting down just before [the actual anniversary]. We want to just be with our families and friends.There has been so much gun violence in the news recently -- and since Sandy Hook, an American child has died by gun violence every other day. Does all of that make this year feel more emotional for you?Every single shooting takes me straight back to the day that I lost my son -- knowing how those communities are being affected, and how those families are being affected. And now that it's been three years, I also know that this journey doesn't get any easier. Time feels very fluid to me now, in a very strange way. It doesn't feel like it's been three years; yet at the same time, it feels like it's been a hundred years. I don't know how to articulate it. It saddens us that there are more and more shootings, more families having to deal with this trauma, and loss and heartbreak, and knowing that a lot of these are preventable -- as ours was.We don't want other people to feel how we feel. It's too late for us, but we can help ensure that other families don't have to count the years.Many Newtown parents have been vocal about the necessity of gun control -- testifying before Connecticut state leaders, for example. At the same time, we're hearing the news that many states have actually expanded gun rights. Are you frustrated by the lack of progress? We feel the pressure of time. We absolutely believe that things will change, and we absolutely believe that more gun violence will be prevented. We know that the programs we're creating work. But it's a long process, and it's going to take a long time. It frustrates us and hurts that along the way there's still going to be so many people that die, because we can't move fast enough. Do you feel like people at least feel like the need for change is more urgent now?The outrage is definitely continuing, and it's growing. Again, time is tricky with me -- my memory is like Swiss cheese now -- but I'd say in the last year, I have seen an increase in people saying. ""Oregon. That's it. I need to do something now."" Or, San Bernadino. Charleston. After each time, there's this increased volume of people saying, ""What can I do?""But there's this feeling of helplessness and hopelessness that too many people still have. Sometimes when more shootings happen, it inspires people to action, but it can also be de-sensitizing, in terms of ""Well, that's just the way it is in America. This is our new normal."" For anyone to accept this as ""normal"" is just wrong, and for anyone to throw up their hands and say, ""Well, what can be done?"" -- that's not helping. Stop throwing your hands up in the air and saying, ""It's the gun lobby"" or ""It's the politicians."" No. Why don't you take personal responsibility? Find out what you can do, and make a difference.Has your work with Sandy Hook Promise helped you personally heal at all?Healing is a tricky word. But for me, I've been full-time with this organization for almost three years now, and without a doubt it has helped me answer a lot of questions I had in my mind as to how can this have happened, and it has taught me a lot about what could have been done to stop it. It's therapy for me. Now it's not just, ""I lost Dylan and he's gone -- that's it."" His spirit lives on through the work we're doing. So many parents will be thinking of you, and Dylan, and all the families affected by the shooting today. How can they honor you?Today, I would say, hug your kids. Spend time with your kids. Realize how precious they are to you and think about what you would do to protect them. The day after that, go to an organization that focuses on preventing violence. Take action in your community now. I would turn back time in a moment to have my boy back in my arms, but I can't do that. So all I can do is try and make something positive come from his death.This account has been edited and condensed. To read an essay by Hockley on parenting after the loss of her son, visit here.

5,BUSINESS,One Company's Mission To Fix Our Sleep Deprivation Crisis,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aetna-sleep-deprivation-fi_us_566725b4e4b08e945ff12ca0,The health insurance provider Aetna wants you to know the difference a good night's rest makes.,2015-12-14,Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini has made sleep health a major priority in the workplace.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5667583a1600002800e55603.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A whopping 40 percent of Americans are getting less than their recommended nightly sleep -- an issue the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes as a ""public health problem.""But more people and corporations are increasingly waking up to the importance of a healthy night's sleep. Leading the charge is the Hartford-based health insurance giant Aetna. Under the leadership of CEO Mark Bertolini, the company has made sleep health a major priority in the workplace -- and now it will share the art and science of good sleep with the public. Aetna is sponsoring a new content series entitled ""Healthy Sleep Matters: A New Look at the Importance of Sleep."" It features articles including sponsored stories on The New York Times website, quizzes, videos and infographics, social media posts and a week-long ""takeover"" on the company's internal website to raise awareness among employees. Dr. Ed Pezalla, Aetna's clinical sleep expert, said the idea arose during a brainstorm in which executives realized that sleep is a critical issue for people of all ages and demographics, not just adolescents.""It also fit into other issues that we were working on at the time, like distracted driving, drowsy driving and driving under the influence of certain medications,"" he told The Huffington Post. ""And we thought, sleep is an integral part of life that we should talk about."" The new content offers scientific facts and practical tips around sleep. One of the ""sleep tip"" quote cards from Aetna's senior medical director reads, ""Having a sleep routine that includes preparing for the next day creates less anxiety in the morning."" In one video, which has been viewed over 1.5 million times on YouTube and is featured below, a group of people who haven't been able to dream because of a sleep disorder describe the first vivid dreams they've had in years. In another video, the ""Aetna Sleep Deprivation Challenge,"" highlights the impact of sleep deprivation, as it shows athletes and stunt people going through everyday obstacles while under the simulated effects of sleep deprivation -- including poor balance and coordination, slow reaction time and a lack of mental clarity.This focus on health sleep, stress reduction and wellness is deeply ingrained into Aetna's corporate culture. ""We want to talk about this in the wider community -- this is a community issue,"" Pezalla said. ""But within our own offices too, we want to educate them about getting healthy sleep. This fits very well with our corporate approach to wellness, which includes working with our employees on mindfulness and making stress-reduction techniques available to them. Sleep is one part of this broader effort to help our workforce be healthier."" Bertolini has been an outspoken wellness advocate since 2004, when he experienced a near-fatal ski accident. To recover and cope with the chronic pain he was experiencing, Bertolini took up yoga, meditation and other holistic health practices. Now, he offers meditation and yoga classes to his more than 50,000 employees. A study conducted on Aetna employees revealed that among the roughly one quarter of those who participated in the classes have reported on average a 28 percent reduction in their stress levels and a 20 percent improvement in sleep quality. These more relaxed and better-rested workers gain 62 minutes per week of productivity each on average -- a boost that the company estimates to be worth $3,000 per employee per year.""Overall, people function better if they've had enough sleep,"" Pezalla said. ""Productivity studies show that one of the things that reduces productivity is when people haven't gotten enough sleep -- it's harder to engage and its harder to stay focused."" Another study on 239 Aetna employees -- one third of whom took yoga classes at work, one third meditation classes and one third who did neither -- revealed that workers who took yoga and meditation classes reported significant reductions in their stress levels as well as relief from sleep disturbances. ""The first year after we did the program, our health care costs actually dropped 7.5 percent as a company,"" Bertolini told PBS in May. Aetna hopes to change the national conversation around sleep, recognizing our need for eight hours of nightly rest as the third pillar of health, along with diet and exercise. ""The important thing here is to recognize that we do have control over our sleep to some extent,"" Pezalla said. ""We can make a healthy sleep environment for ourselves, we can work on reducing stress in our daily lives through mindfulness. Hopefully by talking about it more, people will realize that we can do better on sleep."" Also on HuffPost:"

As I always say, it takes a village -- not just one person. This is not just an accomplishment for me, but for my whole team and all my fans. I am beyond honored.” While Williams’ year was capped off by heartbreak and what-ifs in the form of a stunning U.S. Open loss to underdog Roberta Vinci, she amassed a 53-3 record and three major tournament titles, notched her second career Serena Slam and spent six weeks with more than double the ranking points of the No. 2 player in the world. She was just that dominant, just that much better than everyone else in the field, even while fighting through a series of injuries. And while it all seemed to come crashing down in the days following that upset at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Williams claims that the lessons she learned the hard way in September of this year will only propel her to be tougher next time: to be hungrier, more accurate and more on her toes when the Vincis of the world lace up against her.“I didn’t want to necessarily put a fist through a wall [when I lost at the U.S. Open] -- I felt more like, Ah, man, I was so close!” Williams explained. “I’ll always think about what I could have done better. Could I have come up on the net? Been more consistent? It’s not anger. It’s analyzing: What can I do next time?”After all, as she wrote on Snapchat just about two months ago, she’ll be back. And she’ll be ready to reclaim the title of champion.“I’ve got some good news and some bad news. The good news is I dreamed about tennis last night. The bad news is everybody better watch out.”Also on HuffPost:"

""Statement: It's all true,"" he tweeted. ""I have used profanity when I've been angry at people. When I was wrong (as with Tina) I've said sorry to them."" Good move, Colin. PREVIOUSLY: You don't become one of the most successful stars in Hollywood without stepping on a few toes along the way. Take Tina Fey, star of ""30 Rock"" and the upcoming Amy Poehler buddy comedy ""Sisters,"" who served as the first female head writer at ""Saturday Night Live"" from 1997 to 2006. In an interview on Sirius XM's ""The Howard Stern Show,"" Fey, a frequent guest on the boundary pushing radio hour, told the host that an ""SNL"" co-star once called her ""a c**t.""She was initially reluctant to give up the name of her famous detractor, but with a little cajoling from Stern, she revealed Colin Quinn was the culprit. Listen to a clip from the interview above. “We’ve since made up,” she told Stern. “This was [when I was a head writer]. I love him so much.”“I was trying to help him with a show that he was working on,"" Fey continued. ""I think his anxiety about the writing of the show spilled over, because it was very random. I was like ‘What?’ He left me a message and he said that ... and I couldn’t even guess why. Usually if someone calls you that, you’re like, ‘I know what I did.’”""Guess who's not in 'Sisters,'"" Stern joked. ""Colin Quinn.""Quinn most recently played Amy Schumer's misanthropic father in the summer smash ""Trainwreck"" and frequently trades barbs with Schumer over text message, which she hilariously shares on Instagram.

Dannel Malloy said the Sandy Hook tragedy has made him an even bigger advocate of gun safety.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_99_771_4409_2054%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Today marks the third anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where on an otherwise typical New England day, in a quintessentially New England town, 20 first-graders and six educators were gunned down.What defines that event, beyond the horrific carnage, is just how little change actually came from it.Those in political office when the shooting happened call it the nadir of their professional lives. Barack Obama's speechwriter at the time, Jon Favreau, recalled walking into the Oval Office to hand the president a draft of the speech he was to deliver to the press corps later that afternoon, only to realize that the two weren't making eye contact.""He barely looked up from his desk and couldn't even look at me because there were tears in his eyes,"" said Favreau. Later, Obama would email longtime aide David Axelrod and note that it had been the first time he had cried in the Oval Office.At the state level, the burden of the violence was even heavier. As Connecticut's Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) told The Huffington Post on Monday:Quite frankly, a lot of my memories are of the parents who I had to tell or the spouses I had to tell, who weren't going to be reunited that day. I can tell you that, to this day, that weighs heavy having to have been the person who did that. I think about Sandy Hook every single day frankly. I wear a couple wristbands: one commemorating the tragic event itself and one marking up the final funeral that I attended, a little girl who died.Two days after the shooting, Obama traveled to Newtown to deliver a memorial for the fallen. As Joshua Dubois, the former head of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, wrote in his book The President's Devotional, the emotional weight of the moment was almost suffocating. Person after person received an engulfing hug from our commander in chief. He'd say, ""Tell me about your son. ... Tell me about your daughter,"" and then hold pictures of the lost beloved as their parents described favorite foods, television shows, and the sound of their laughter. For the younger siblings of those who had passed away -- many of them two, three, or four years old, too young to understand it all -- the president would grab them and toss them, laughing, up into the air, and then hand them a box of White House M&M's, which were always kept close at hand. In each room, I saw his eyes water, but he did not break.And yet, three years later, nothing has changed -- no gun laws have been passed. School shootings continue to occur with regularity. Only the most optimistic of gun control advocates seem to believe anything will happen on the federal level any time soon. But Malloy, who was able to pass some gun control measures in Connecticut, spoke bullishly about the prospects -- if only because the status quo is so unbearable, he said.""I was an advocate for gun safety before I became governor,"" Malloy said. ""I'm an even bigger advocate post-Sandy Hook. The number one thing that America can do to make itself safer would be to have universal background checks. We are going to have them someday. The question is how many more Sandy Hooks or Columbines or mass shootings in state after state are going to have to take place before people wake up and smell the coffee."""

He is not a leader,” Brown wrote. “He is a supreme narcissist, and you can deprive him of the one thing that keeps him going—airtime.”She claimed that the move would not amount to censorship since Trump would still have YouTube at his disposal.Brown has started a petition on Change.org asking the networks to ban Trump and coined the social media hashtag #TurnOffTrump to promote her efforts.Her petition had just 97 supporters as of Saturday evening.A narrower effort to change the media's coverage of Trump has gained more traction. Credo Action's Dec. 9 petition calling on MSNBC and CNN specifically to stop covering Trump disproportionately has over 176,000 signers as of Monday.Brown’s proposal drew praise and cries of agreement on Twitter, but not everyone was supportive.Jack Shafer, a media critic at Politico -- the same outlet that published Brown -- called the op-ed the “stupidest article” he had ever read.This article has been updated with information about the Credo Action petition.

13,THE WORLDPOST,Thousands Of Brazilians Take To The Streets To Demand President's Impeachment,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brazil-protests-impeachment_us_566de089e4b0e292150e450d,"""This is just a warm-up, there will be a huge mobilization in January,"" one protester said.",2015-12-13,Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets of major cities to demand President Dilma Rousseff's ouster. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58758327170000880192960f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAO PAULO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets of major cities on Sunday to demand President Dilma Rousseff’s ouster, but the first nationwide protests since formal impeachment proceedings began were smaller than similar events earlier this year.Police did not provide official estimates for turnout although television stations said there were about 6,000 in Sao Paulo and slightly fewer in Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia.“This is just a warm-up, there will be a huge mobilization in January,” said Paloma Morena, a 35-year-old chemist on Sao Paulo’s most famous street, Avenida Paulista.Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in August and up to a million Brazilians were estimated to have turned out in March. A large-scale mobilization could increase pressure on lawmakers to vote for Rousseff’s impeachment.Lower House Speaker Eduardo Cunha opened impeachment proceedings on Dec. 2, agreeing Congress should consider opposition allegations that Rousseff violated budget laws to increase spending during her 2014 re-election campaign.But many Brazilians are more upset about the worst economic recession in at least 25 years and a corruption scandal at state-run oil firm Petrobras that has ensnared many of her allies. Rousseff is not under investigation, but many Brazilians question how she could not have known about the corruption as she was chairwoman of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010.“Inflation is through the roof, unemployment is shockingly high and we get nothing for the amount of taxes we pay,” said Andre Patrao, a 47-year-old economist demonstrating in Rio’s posh Copacabana neighborhood.Currently the opposition is not thought to have the votes to impeach Rousseff, who denies mishandling public accounts and has pledged to fight impeachment in order to finish her second term.If a house committee decides in favor of impeachment, the process will go to a full vote on the house floor, where the opposition needs two-thirds of the votes to begin a 180-day impeachment trial in the Senate. During that trial, Rousseff would be suspended and replaced by Vice President Michel Temer.The Supreme Court has suspended impeachment proceedings until it rules on the validity of a secret ballot vote that selected the members of the house committee. Meanwhile Cunha, a former ally who broke with Rousseff, is facing formal charges in the Petrobras investigation over allegations he took bribes.Brazil’s largest umbrella union CUT has called a protest to support Rousseff on Dec. 16.
