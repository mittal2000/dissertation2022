""I would have liked to take care of our wonderful country for you as president.""Hofer's defeat averts an embarrassing setback for Europe's political establishment, which is increasingly under threat from populist parties that have profited from concerns about the region's refugee crisis and years of weak growth and high unemployment.""It's a relief to see the Austrians reject populism and extremism,"" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said in a Twitter post. ""Everyone in Europe must draw lessons from this.""Austria is a relatively prosperous country, but it has been at the center of a record influx of migrants from the Middle East, fanning public resentment towards the two centrist parties - the Social Democrats (SPO) and the conservative People's Party - that have dominated politics since the end of World War Two.Sunday's provisional result, which did not include the postal ballots, showed Hofer ahead with 51.9 percent to van der Bellen's 48.1 percent.But the SORA institute, a pollster, had said that mail-in ballots were likely to favor van der Bellen because they are traditionally used by more educated voters. The institute's election-day polling showed 81 percent of voters with a university degree had backed van der Bellen and 86 percent of workers voted for Hofer.The vote in Austria, a country of 8.5 million people, had unsettled leaders elsewhere in Europe, particularly in neighbor Germany where a new anti-immigration party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), is on the rise.In France, the National Front of Marine Le Pen is leading in polls ahead of a presidential election next year. Across the Channel, the UK Independence Party is campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in a referendum on June 23.Hofer, 45, has described himself as a center-right politician and told voters not to believe suggestions from other parties that he would be a dangerous president.But his party has its roots in Austria's Nazi past, a history the country has not confronted as openly as Germany."

The United Nations, the United States and human rights groups have said Yameen's government failed to follow due process and that the case was politically motivated.Government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment on the British decision.Yameen, whose half-brother lost power to Nasheed in 2008, has rejected accusations Nasheed's trial was politically motivated and said the legal process was fair.In 2009, Nasheed led the world's first underwater cabinet meeting to grab attention over rising sea levels that threaten his country."

But he insisted the arms embargo move was not linked to China.""The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations. It was based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalization withVietnam,"" he said. Obama later added his visit to a former foe showed ""hearts can change and peace is possible"".The sale of arms, Obama said, would depend on Vietnam's human rights commitments, and would be made on a case-by-case basis.HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP OUTRAGEDHuman Rights Watch reacted with dismay to Washington's decision to toss away a critical lever it might have had to spur political reform in the Communist party-ruled state.Phil Robertson, the watchdog's Asia director, said in a statement that even as Obama was lifting the arms embargo Vietnamese authorities were arresting a journalist, human rights activists and bloggers on the street and in their houses.""In one fell swoop, President Obama has jettisoned what remained of U.S. leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam – and basically gotten nothing for it,"" he said.Obama told the news conference with President Quang Washington would continue to speak out for human rights, including citizens' right to organize through civil society.Obama is scheduled to meet with a group of activists on Tuesday.Quang, who actually announced the lifting of the U.S. embargo before Obama could do so, was until recently minister of public security, which activists say harasses and arrests dissidents.Dissent was once the domain of just a few in Vietnam, but while the party has allowed more open criticism in recent years, it is quick to slap down challenges to its monopoly on power.LEVERAGE ON ARMS DEALSThough the communist parties that run China and Vietnam officially have brotherly ties, China's brinkmanship over the South China Sea - where it has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors - has forced Vietnam to recalibrate its defense strategy.Security analysts and regional military attaches expect Vietnam's initial wish list of equipment to cover the latest in surveillance radar, intelligence and communications technology, allowing them better coverage of the South China Sea as well as improved integration of its growing forces.Washington has allowed sales of defensive maritime equipment since 2014. Hanoi's military strategists are expected to now seek drones, radar, coastal patrol boats and possibly P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft from the United States.Carl Thayer, an expert on Vietnam's military at Australia's Defence Force Academy, said the steep costs of U.S. arms would remain a factor for Hanoi, pushing it toward its traditional suppliers of missiles and planes, particularly long-time security patron, Russia. On the other hand, the lifting of the embargo will provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with those suppliers.China sees U.S. support for rival South China Sea claimants Vietnam and the Philippines as interference and an attempt to establish hegemony in the region. Washington insists its priority is ensuring freedom of navigation and flight.However, China's response to the announcement in Hanoi was muted. The foreign ministry said it hoped the development in relations between the United States and Vietnam would be conducive to regional peace and stability.Underlining the burgeoning commercial relationship between the United States and Vietnam, one of the first deals signed on Obama's trip was an $11.3 billion order for 100 Boeing planes by low-cost airline VietJet.China is Vietnam's biggest trade partner and source of imports. But trade with the United States has swelled 10-fold over the past two decades to about $45 billion.

But he insisted the arms embargo move was not linked to China.""The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations. It was based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalization withVietnam,"" he said. Obama later added his visit to a former foe showed ""hearts can change and peace is possible"".The sale of arms, Obama said, would depend on Vietnam's human rights commitments, and would be made on a case-by-case basis.HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP OUTRAGEDHuman Rights Watch reacted with dismay to Washington's decision to toss away a critical lever it might have had to spur political reform in the Communist party-ruled state.Phil Robertson, the watchdog's Asia director, said in a statement that even as Obama was lifting the arms embargo Vietnamese authorities were arresting a journalist, human rights activists and bloggers on the street and in their houses.""In one fell swoop, President Obama has jettisoned what remained of U.S. leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam – and basically gotten nothing for it,"" he said.Obama told the news conference with President Quang Washington would continue to speak out for human rights, including citizens' right to organize through civil society.Obama is scheduled to meet with a group of activists on Tuesday.Quang, who actually announced the lifting of the U.S. embargo before Obama could do so, was until recently minister of public security, which activists say harasses and arrests dissidents.Dissent was once the domain of just a few in Vietnam, but while the party has allowed more open criticism in recent years, it is quick to slap down challenges to its monopoly on power.LEVERAGE ON ARMS DEALSThough the communist parties that run China and Vietnam officially have brotherly ties, China's brinkmanship over the South China Sea - where it has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors - has forced Vietnam to recalibrate its defense strategy.Security analysts and regional military attaches expect Vietnam's initial wish list of equipment to cover the latest in surveillance radar, intelligence and communications technology, allowing them better coverage of the South China Sea as well as improved integration of its growing forces.Washington has allowed sales of defensive maritime equipment since 2014. Hanoi's military strategists are expected to now seek drones, radar, coastal patrol boats and possibly P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft from the United States.Carl Thayer, an expert on Vietnam's military at Australia's Defence Force Academy, said the steep costs of U.S. arms would remain a factor for Hanoi, pushing it toward its traditional suppliers of missiles and planes, particularly long-time security patron, Russia. On the other hand, the lifting of the embargo will provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with those suppliers.China sees U.S. support for rival South China Sea claimants Vietnam and the Philippines as interference and an attempt to establish hegemony in the region. Washington insists its priority is ensuring freedom of navigation and flight.However, China's response to the announcement in Hanoi was muted. The foreign ministry said it hoped the development in relations between the United States and Vietnam would be conducive to regional peace and stability.Underlining the burgeoning commercial relationship between the United States and Vietnam, one of the first deals signed on Obama's trip was an $11.3 billion order for 100 Boeing planes by low-cost airline VietJet.China is Vietnam's biggest trade partner and source of imports. But trade with the United States has swelled 10-fold over the past two decades to about $45 billion. Vietnam is now Southeast Asia's biggest exporter to America.In the commercial hub, Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, Obama will on Tuesday meet entrepreneurs and tout a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal he has championed.Obama said at the news conference he was confident the trade pact would be approved by U.S. legislators, even though it is an election year. He said he had not seen a credible argument that the deal, which will group 12 economies, would hurt U.S. business."

16,POLITICS,Med Students Take Battle Against Opioid Epidemic Into Their Own Hands,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opioid-epidemic-medical-students-harvard_us_573e35c9e4b045cc9a707ca0,Because how to treat addiction isn't taught enough in medical schools.,2016-05-23,An emergency opiate overdose kit turns the liquid naloxone into a nose spray that helps the person start breathing again.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5743500f1600002a00f9438b.jpeg?ops=crop_0_313_2000_1567%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Students at Harvard Medical School may just be the first doctors-in-training to learn how to administer one of the most effective drugs for combating America's opioid epidemic. But they had to organize the class themselves.The students were frustrated by the dearth of formal coursework on treating addiction -- at Harvard and other medical schools -- even as overdoses from heroin, fentanyl and pain relievers like oxycodone are reaching record numbers. In 2014, at least 28,647 people died of opioid overdoses in the U.S.So this semester, some of the future doctors at Harvard's Center for Primary Care arranged for optional trainings on administering buprenorphine, which eases a person's cravings for opioids, as well as naloxone, which can save the life of someone who has overdosed on an opioid.""What kind of a doctor would I be if I didn't know how to do this?"" said John Weems, a fourth-year medical student, who helped initiate the training sessions. The use of buprenorphine, a prescription drug also known by the brand name Suboxone, is tightly controlled. Only doctors who receive a Drug Enforcement Administration waiver after completing an eight-hour course can prescribe it, and there are caps on how many patients a doctor can see. Yet when combined with counseling in what's known as medication-assisted treatment, it's an effective way to treat opioid addiction.Unfortunately, fewer doctors than needed have signed up to prescribe buprenorphine, so the Obama administration in March proposed increasing the number of patients permitted per doctor.This semester, 19 Harvard students took the exact course required by the DEA as a pilot program. They were likely the first to receive that training before obtaining their medical degree, according to Dr. Joji Suzuki, a Harvard psychiatrist who conducted the course.Suzuki said the current generation of med students shows much more interest in learning about addiction than did their predecessors who are now setting the curriculum.""It's no secret that addiction in the American medical training system has not been comprehensive,"" he said. ""The ironic part is that the opioid epidemic has been raging for over a decade, but there are effective treatments that are already available.""It's unclear whether the students' training can later be credited toward the DEA requirements, because usually only resident physicians or full-fledged doctors take the course. But Weems, who received the buprenorphine training, said he's part of a team that will publish a study on the pilot program. ""That publication will offer some data that will hopefully open up a conversation among the medical community about the future of training med students in buprenorphine administration,"" Weems said. Buprenorphine can help patients over the longer term. Naloxone can save the life of someone overdosing an opioid right now. It's relatively easy to administer, and it's even available without a prescription in Massachusetts.Yet few med students learn how to use the drug, which is sold under the brand name Narcan in the form of a nasal spray. This semester, about 200 Harvard students learned how to use Narcan after a required lesson in basic life support procedures. Some students, who led this training, later taught nurses and other medical professionals in clinics around Boston how to use naloxone, too. Student Siva Sundaram said he hoped the training would also reduce the reluctance among doctors to work with people with substance abuse disorders. ""We’re really trying to figure out how to reach people early on in medical school before they acquire the basic assumptions that addiction is impossible to treat,"" he said.For decades, substance abuse in America was treated less as a public health concern and more as a matter for the criminal justice system. But those attitudes are changing.Any high school can obtain an overdose reversal kit through a partnership of the Clinton Foundation and Adapt Pharma, Narcan's manufacturer. On May 14, rapper Macklemore spoke about his struggle with opioids on President Barack Obama's radio address. Congress is currently considering a range of bills aimed at the opioid epidemic, some of which focus on opioid treatment and recovery. The concerns and attitudes of current medical students could usher a shift in medical training as well. ""The diseases which were so very common, life-threatening, and shortening of yesterday were those that shaped the medical school curriculum experiences,"" said Dr. Mark Gold, an addiction specialist retired from the University of Florida. ""These students know what problems they see in their peers, their classmates, and on their rotations throughout the medical school."""

Yale paid a former student, Fernanda Lopez Aguilar, $2,000 and instructed her to sign a gag order after she reported in 2010 that Pogge sexually harassed her, the federal complaint alleges. Years later, when multiple additional allegations were shared with Yale administrators detailing claims that Pogge acted inappropriately with other students, the university declined to investigate, saying it did not have jurisdiction, according to emails obtained by The Huffington Post.The allegations, first reported by BuzzFeed on Friday and independently reviewed by The Huffington Post, were leveled against Yale in a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights by Lopez Aguilar and two other women in October 2015.Pogge is a professor of philosophy and international affairs at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and holds appointments at the University of Oslo, King’s College London and the University of Central Lancashire. In a statement sent to HuffPost on Sunday, Pogge denied Lopez Aguilar's claims, suggested she brought them after he declined to employ her in a program at Yale, and offered to pay for and take a polygraph test to prove his innocence.""I am deeply grateful that, despite all the excoriation, no one else has brought forward a false charge – no one at Yale and no one at the 600+ academic venues I have visited since joining Yale,"" Pogge said. ""I will continue to do what I can do, under the circumstances, to put these allegations to rest.""Yale declined to comment to HuffPost on Saturday. ""Unless these institutions are unveiled to the public, there tends to be little chance of helping them reform their antiquated and discriminatory norms,"" Lopez Aguilar told HuffPost.The Huffington Post reviewed hundreds of pages of unredacted documents related to this case, which were gathered from multiple sources. HuffPost also spoke with several professors and graduate students with knowledge of the allegations against Pogge. Lopez Aguilar, who received her bachelor's degree from Yale in May 2010, said in her complaint that Pogge planned to hire her to work in Yale's Global Justice Program, which he founded. According to documents submitted with the complaint, Pogge assured Lopez she would be paid for work in the GJP, writing, ""we'll make it work out, don't worry. I even have a little money of my own."" She was later listed on the GJP website as a fellow.Lopez Aguilar began doing work for Pogge and GJP in the summer of 2010, she said. During a June 2010 trip to a Yale Law School conference in Chile, Lopez Aguilar said Pogge began acting inappropriately and flirting with her and suggested they share a hotel room. One night during the trip, while Lopez Aguilar was sitting at a desk studying, Pogge slid in between the back of the chair and her body, straddling it, the complaint states. She said she felt his erection on her lower back and he groped her legs and breast. She left the room and when she returned, he did not speak to her.[Related: Jimmy Carter Pushes Yale To Get Tougher On Campus Rape]Lopez Aguilar continued to do work for Pogge, but discovered in late August that Yale had no record of her being a GJP employee, her complaint said. She showed the university a letter of employment Pogge had written on Yale stationery to help her secure an apartment. Pogge emailed her that day and accused her of damaging his professional relationships, according to a copy of the email obtained by HuffPost. A week later he sent her another message: ""After what happened I do not want GJP to receive further help from you, paid or unpaid.""""In retrospect, I believe that both of us were unnecessarily confrontational in our dispute and could and should have parted ways in a more civil manner,"" Pogge said in Sunday's statement.Believing she'd been fired from GJP without ever receiving payment, Lopez Aguilar decided to report to Yale that Pogge sexually harassed her during the Chile trip. In December 2010, Yale offered to pay $2,000 to Lopez Aguilar -- money that she believed she was owed for work she performed over the summer. But she would be paid only if she signed an agreement to never bring a complaint or lawsuit over her claim that Pogge sexually harassed her or publicly discuss her allegations.In spring 2011, the Education Department opened an investigation into an unrelated complaint that Yale violated Title IX in how it handled sexual assault and harassment. The news prompted Lopez Aguilar to speak anonymously to the student newspaper about a few details of her case. Shortly after that article, she said Yale officials reached out to her and offered to conduct a fuller investigation into her report that Pogge harassed her.Pogge denied Lopez Aguilar's claims of misconduct and a Yale panel ultimately cleared him of sexual harassment, but faulted him for misuse of university stationery for writing Lopez Aguilar a fake letter of employment. It also noted in a report that Pogge ""created an intimate and unprofessional atmosphere"" with Lopez Aguilar and said ""we question Prof. Pogge’s judgment."" His punishment was a letter in his file, documents show.Pogge claims that Lopez Aguilar's story has changed several times, and that he has evidence to show inconsistencies, but cannot share it. ""I must avoid anything that might be construed as retaliation against my accuser and I must respect the privacy of third parties who do not wish to be identified by name,"" Pogge said. Lopez Aguilar then worked with attorney Ann Olivarius in 2012. Olivarius' firm began contacting female students who'd had negative experiences with Pogge for potential litigation. In spring 2014, Lopez Aguilar connected with a woman who wrote an anonymous blog post on Thought Catalog about her relationship with Pogge. The writer knew about female students at other universities with whom, she believed, Pogge had acted inappropriately. They decided to present the evidence, which included testimony from students Pogge had dated, to Yale.Yale declined to investigate the new claims, according to emails obtained by HuffPost. It told the author of the blog post it did not have jurisdiction over alleged harassment of non-Yale students. The women filed a new complaint against Yale with the Education Department in October 2015, saying the university's decision not to investigate was the last act of a Title IX violation.The department has not made a decision on whether it will investigate the case. ""After I internalized all that had transpired, all the injustices that had been committed not only against me but against every potential future victim of Pogge’s, I earned a sense of peace with coming forward, and necessity,"" Lopez Aguilar said.[Related: Yale Fails To Expel Students Guilty Of Sexual Assault]Lopez Aguilar had previously filed a complaint over her case in 2011 after a group of 16 students successfully got the Education Department to open a Title IX investigation of Yale. At the time, the Education Department said it would transfer her complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to be addressed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In January 2012, the EEOC told her a new agent was reviewing her case, emails show. But after a brief exchange in 2012, Lopez Aguilar did not hear back from the EEOC.In late April, HuffPost contacted EEOC agents for an update on Lopez Aguilar's case against Yale. HuffPost received a response from an EEOC Enforcement Supervisor who said ""I'll take care of this."" That person then contacted Lopez Aguilar on May 9 and said that the EEOC would be closing the case because too much time had passed since the alleged incident, but that it would issue her a right to sue letter. (A person who claims discrimination must have this letter from the EEOC before they are allowed to file a lawsuit against an institution that allegedly wronged them.)""The EEOC’s failure to respond to my complaint and the OCR’s attempt to redirect my complaint in the first place are both events that speak for themselves,"" Lopez Aguilar said.EEOC declined to comment to HuffPost on its handling of the case._______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.

According to documents submitted with the complaint, Pogge assured Lopez she would be paid for work in the GJP, writing, ""we'll make it work out, don't worry. I even have a little money of my own."" She was later listed on the GJP website as a fellow.Lopez Aguilar began doing work for Pogge and GJP in the summer of 2010, she said. During a June 2010 trip to a Yale Law School conference in Chile, Lopez Aguilar said Pogge began acting inappropriately and flirting with her and suggested they share a hotel room. One night during the trip, while Lopez Aguilar was sitting at a desk studying, Pogge slid in between the back of the chair and her body, straddling it, the complaint states. She said she felt his erection on her lower back and he groped her legs and breast. She left the room and when she returned, he did not speak to her.[Related: Jimmy Carter Pushes Yale To Get Tougher On Campus Rape]Lopez Aguilar continued to do work for Pogge, but discovered in late August that Yale had no record of her being a GJP employee, her complaint said. She showed the university a letter of employment Pogge had written on Yale stationery to help her secure an apartment. Pogge emailed her that day and accused her of damaging his professional relationships, according to a copy of the email obtained by HuffPost. A week later he sent her another message: ""After what happened I do not want GJP to receive further help from you, paid or unpaid.""""In retrospect, I believe that both of us were unnecessarily confrontational in our dispute and could and should have parted ways in a more civil manner,"" Pogge said in Sunday's statement.Believing she'd been fired from GJP without ever receiving payment, Lopez Aguilar decided to report to Yale that Pogge sexually harassed her during the Chile trip. In December 2010, Yale offered to pay $2,000 to Lopez Aguilar -- money that she believed she was owed for work she performed over the summer. But she would be paid only if she signed an agreement to never bring a complaint or lawsuit over her claim that Pogge sexually harassed her or publicly discuss her allegations.In spring 2011, the Education Department opened an investigation into an unrelated complaint that Yale violated Title IX in how it handled sexual assault and harassment. The news prompted Lopez Aguilar to speak anonymously to the student newspaper about a few details of her case. Shortly after that article, she said Yale officials reached out to her and offered to conduct a fuller investigation into her report that Pogge harassed her.Pogge denied Lopez Aguilar's claims of misconduct and a Yale panel ultimately cleared him of sexual harassment, but faulted him for misuse of university stationery for writing Lopez Aguilar a fake letter of employment. It also noted in a report that Pogge ""created an intimate and unprofessional atmosphere"" with Lopez Aguilar and said ""we question Prof. Pogge’s judgment."" His punishment was a letter in his file, documents show.Pogge claims that Lopez Aguilar's story has changed several times, and that he has evidence to show inconsistencies, but cannot share it. ""I must avoid anything that might be construed as retaliation against my accuser and I must respect the privacy of third parties who do not wish to be identified by name,"" Pogge said. Lopez Aguilar then worked with attorney Ann Olivarius in 2012. Olivarius' firm began contacting female students who'd had negative experiences with Pogge for potential litigation. In spring 2014, Lopez Aguilar connected with a woman who wrote an anonymous blog post on Thought Catalog about her relationship with Pogge. The writer knew about female students at other universities with whom, she believed, Pogge had acted inappropriately. They decided to present the evidence, which included testimony from students Pogge had dated, to Yale.Yale declined to investigate the new claims, according to emails obtained by HuffPost. It told the author of the blog post it did not have jurisdiction over alleged harassment of non-Yale students. The women filed a new complaint against Yale with the Education Department in October 2015, saying the university's decision not to investigate was the last act of a Title IX violation.The department has not made a decision on whether it will investigate the case. ""After I internalized all that had transpired, all the injustices that had been committed not only against me but against every potential future victim of Pogge’s, I earned a sense of peace with coming forward, and necessity,"" Lopez Aguilar said.[Related: Yale Fails To Expel Students Guilty Of Sexual Assault]Lopez Aguilar had previously filed a complaint over her case in 2011 after a group of 16 students successfully got the Education Department to open a Title IX investigation of Yale. At the time, the Education Department said it would transfer her complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to be addressed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In January 2012, the EEOC told her a new agent was reviewing her case, emails show. But after a brief exchange in 2012, Lopez Aguilar did not hear back from the EEOC.In late April, HuffPost contacted EEOC agents for an update on Lopez Aguilar's case against Yale. HuffPost received a response from an EEOC Enforcement Supervisor who said ""I'll take care of this."" That person then contacted Lopez Aguilar on May 9 and said that the EEOC would be closing the case because too much time had passed since the alleged incident, but that it would issue her a right to sue letter. (A person who claims discrimination must have this letter from the EEOC before they are allowed to file a lawsuit against an institution that allegedly wronged them.)""The EEOC’s failure to respond to my complaint and the OCR’s attempt to redirect my complaint in the first place are both events that speak for themselves,"" Lopez Aguilar said.EEOC declined to comment to HuffPost on its handling of the case._______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.

His evil stemmed from a less obvious power: Kilgrave could compel people to do exactly as he said simply by saying it, a type of mind control that made for a darkly entertaining yet deeply unsettling antagonist. Yet when Kilgrave forced Jessica (Krysten Ritter) to confront him, she snapped his neck. A tidy conclusion for Season 1, but one that left viewers wondering how ""Jessica Jones"" could possibly follow up Tennant’s captivating performance. Series creator Melissa Rosenberg acknowledged the challenge ahead of her at New York Magazine’s Vulture Festival in New York on Saturday. And — rest assured — she knows what she’s doing. Asked whether it was “daunting” to think up a fresh antagonist for the upcoming second season, Rosenberg scoffed.""Oh, not at all,"" she said, explaining that the recipe for writing Jessica a new arch-nemesis merely needs to draw on the reluctant heroine's grudges.""For this show, for this character, the ‘big bad’ is all about how personal it is to her,” Rosenberg said. ""Having some guy go in and say, ‘I’m going to take over the city!’ [She] doesn’t care. It’s not going to resonate. So whatever we do just has to be intimate or personal in a way. Not necessarily the history or such, but just connected directly.""For what it's worth, our money's on the mysterious ""IGH."""

""We have said with pride, heads held high, we are comrades of Erdogan ... Your passion is our passion, your cause our cause, your path our path.""Yildirim's main aim, he said, was a new constitution and the creation of an executive presidency, a change Erdogan says will bring stability to the NATO member state of 78 million, but which opponents fear will herald greater authoritarianism.After winning the presidency in 2014 following more than a decade as prime minister, Erdogan was legally bound to renounce ties to the AKP and remain impartial. But he has retained strong influence over both the party he founded and the government, frequently hosting cabinet meetings in his new palace.Yildirim, 60, said constitutional change was a necessity to legitimize the existing situation, tacit acknowledgment that Erdogan has extended the traditionally ceremonial role of the Turkish presidency.""The most important mission we have today is to legalize the de facto situation, to bring to an end this confusion by changing the constitution,"" he said. ""The new constitution will be on an executive presidential system.""Yildirim was the sole candidate for party leader at the AKP congress, called after Ahmet Davutoglu announced he was stepping down as prime minister following weeks of public tension with Erdogan. Yildirim won all 1,405 of the valid votes.As if proof were needed of where power in the party lies, delegates remained standing through a message from Erdogan read out at the start of the congress. Yildirim vowed that, under his leadership, the AKP's way would be ""Erdogan's way."" Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Erdogan was the party's one leader.As transport minister, Yildirim was a driving force behind major infrastructure projects which were one of the pillars of the AKP's electoral successes during its first decade in power.He has made clear he will pursue two of Erdogan's biggest priorities - the executive presidency and the fight against militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the largely Kurdish southeast.""They are asking us when the anti-terror operations will end. I am announcing hereby that operations will end when all our citizens are safe,"" Yildirim said in an emotional speech.""Operations will continue without pause until the bloody-handed terrorist organization PKK ends its armed actions.""""TRANSITION PERIOD""Erdogan and his supporters see an executive presidency, akin to the system in the United States or France, as a guarantee against the fractious coalition politics that hampered the government in the 1990s.His opponents, including some skeptics within the AKP, say he is merely furthering his own ambition.""If they can succeed, this will be a transition period for the executive presidency,"" journalist Abdulkadir Selvi, who is seen as close to AKP, told Reuters.""The presidency issue will be on top of the agenda.""For investors, the key point now will be the future of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, seen as one of the remaining anchors of market confidence.Erdogan, who favors consumption-led growth, has repeatedly railed against high interest rates in Turkey, saying they cause inflation, a stance at odds with mainstream economics.Without Simsek, investors fear, it will be less likely that the government will deliver on promises to liberalize the labor market, encourage savings and bring in more private investment.Yildirim was elected as a deputy for Istanbul in November 2002 when the AKP won its first election. He was appointed transport, maritime and communications minister, a post he then almost continuously held in successive governments.His ties to Erdogan date back to the 1990s when Yildirim, educated in shipbuilding and marine sciences, was in charge of a high-speed ferry company in Istanbul, where Erdogan was mayor."

""It moved today in the direction of the plane crash site because we are working hard to salvage the black boxes.""An oil ministry source said Sisi was referring to a robot submarine used mostly to maintain offshore oil rigs. It was not clear whether the vessel would be able to help locate the black boxes, or would be used in later stages of the operation.Air crash investigation experts say the search teams have around 30 days to listen for pings sent out once every second from beacons attached to the two black boxes. At this stage of the search they would typically use acoustic hydrophones, bringing in more advanced robots later to scan the seabed and retrieve any objects once they have been found.Separately, the U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet said one of its patrol aircraft supporting the search had spotted more than 100 pieces of debris positively identified as having come from an aircraft, and passed the data to the Egyptian Navy.EgyptAir flight 804 from Paris to Cairo vanished off radar screens early on Thursday as it entered Egyptian airspace over the Mediterranean.

""So please, it is very important that we do not talk and say there is a specific scenario.""The crash was the third blow since October to hit Egypt's travel industry, still reeling from political unrest following the 2011 uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak.A suspected Islamic State bombing brought down a Russian airliner after it took off from Sharm al-Sheikh airport in late October, killing all 224 people on board, and an EgyptAir plane was hijacked in March by a man wearing a fake suicide belt.Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Sharm al-Sheikh bombing within hours but a purported statement from the group's spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, distributed on Saturday, made no mention of the crash.ANGUISH OF RELATIVESEgyptAir has told relatives of the victims that recovering and identifying bodies from the sea could take weeks, adding to the pain and uncertainty of grieving families.Samar Ezzedine, 27 years old and newly wed, was one of the cabin crew on flight 804.

""She doesn't want to believe it ... I told her to switch off her phone, but she said: What if Samar calls?""An EgyptAir union appealed to Sisi to allow death certificates to be issued for the victims, to avoid the usual five-year delay in the case of missing people which leaves relatives in a legal limbo, including over pensions.In his speech on Sunday, Sisi said the investigation would not be over quickly, but promised it would be transparent.""This could take a long time but no one can hide these things. As soon as the results are out, people will be informed,"" he told ministers and parliamentarians in the port city of Damietta.The October crash devastated Egyptian tourism, a main source of foreign exchange for a country of 80 million people.Tourism revenue in the first three months of the year plunged by two thirds to $500 million from a year earlier, and the latest incident could crush hopes for a swift recovery.Tourism Minister Yehia Rashed said Egypt faced a huge challenge winning back visitors.

His opponent, former Greens leader Alexander van der Bellen, was on 50.1 percent, leaving both men well within a margin of error of 1.6 percentage points.With more than 10 percent of voters having opted for absentee ballots, which will not be counted in full until Monday, it is possible the result will not be clear until then.""It is a photo finish, a heart-stopping finale,"" van der Bellen's campaign manager Lothar Lockl told ORF, saying he was ""not at all"" disappointed at the projection showing his candidate making up Hofer's 14-point lead in the first round.""In soccer, you would say that this game is going into extra time,"" he added of the run-off election, which is shaping up to be the closest since the aftermath of World War Two.Support for groups like the eurosceptic, anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) has been rising in various countries, whether they have taken in many migrants in the recent influx, like Germany and Sweden, or not, like France and Britain.Most are still far from achieving majority support, meaning Sunday's election is a watershed for those parties, regardless of whether Hofer wins.The race has drawn the most attention to the Austrian presidency since the time of Kurt Waldheim, a former U.N. Secretary-General whose military service with Hitler's brutal army in the Balkans came to light during the 1986 campaign.The international outcry over his hidden past created a nationalist backlash at home that boosted his poll ratings.CEREMONIAL ROLEIn Austria, the president traditionally plays a largely ceremonial role but swears in the chancellor and can dismiss the cabinet.""I have to work for one or two years and then everybody will see that I am OK, I am not a dangerous person,"" Hofer, 45, told reporters after voting in his eastern hometown of Pinkafeld.Hofer, deputy leader of the FPO, is known as the gentler face of the party but has only recently become a household name.Austria took in 90,000 asylum seekers last year, more than 1 percent of its population, many of them shortly after it and neighboring Germany opened their borders last autumn to a wave of migrants including refugees from Syria's civil war.The government has since clamped down on immigration and asylum, but that failed to slow rising support for the FPO, which was already capitalizing on widespread frustration with Austria's two traditional parties of government.Sunday's run-off election comes four weeks after Hofer, 45, won the first round with 35 percent of the vote. That was unexpectedly high although opinion polls regularly show his party ahead of its rivals on more than 30 percent.Van der Bellen, 72, who scored 21 percent in the first round, said after voting in Vienna that he was ""cautiously optimistic.""The result is due to be announced after 1700 GMT. A high number of postal ballots has raised the prospect of the result being unclear until Monday.Tabloid reports of immigrants availing themselves of Austria's generous benefits and of crimes in which immigrants have been suspects have played into the FPO's hands."

Secretary-General whose military service with Hitler's brutal army in the Balkans came to light during the 1986 campaign.The international outcry over his hidden past created a nationalist backlash at home that boosted his poll ratings.CEREMONIAL ROLEIn Austria, the president traditionally plays a largely ceremonial role but swears in the chancellor and can dismiss the cabinet.""I have to work for one or two years and then everybody will see that I am OK, I am not a dangerous person,"" Hofer, 45, told reporters after voting in his eastern hometown of Pinkafeld.Hofer, deputy leader of the FPO, is known as the gentler face of the party but has only recently become a household name.Austria took in 90,000 asylum seekers last year, more than 1 percent of its population, many of them shortly after it and neighboring Germany opened their borders last autumn to a wave of migrants including refugees from Syria's civil war.The government has since clamped down on immigration and asylum, but that failed to slow rising support for the FPO, which was already capitalizing on widespread frustration with Austria's two traditional parties of government.Sunday's run-off election comes four weeks after Hofer, 45, won the first round with 35 percent of the vote. That was unexpectedly high although opinion polls regularly show his party ahead of its rivals on more than 30 percent.Van der Bellen, 72, who scored 21 percent in the first round, said after voting in Vienna that he was ""cautiously optimistic.""The result is due to be announced after 1700 GMT. A high number of postal ballots has raised the prospect of the result being unclear until Monday.Tabloid reports of immigrants availing themselves of Austria's generous benefits and of crimes in which immigrants have been suspects have played into the FPO's hands."

Murrow, good journalism and the truth, can the media stop using euphemisms and stop trying to normalize Trump?"" Huffington said.News outlets, particularly cable news networks -- which have often devoted wall-to-wall coverage to Trump -- have faced backlash for going soft on him during his frequent interviews. They often fail to ask critical follow-up questions, leaving his extreme policy proposals unchallenged. And even when they do challenge his views, such as his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., they give him hours of free airtime.Media critics and observers have warned against normalizing Trump's statements and opinions, particularly his racism and sexism. Earlier this month, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne wrote a piece titled, ""Please Don't Mainstream Trump,"" urging politicians and the media to avoid ""strong temptations to go along"" with Trump.Commenting on the plethora of television interviews with Trump, Bob Garfield, host of WNYC's ""On the Media,"" argued last week that every interviewer should “hold [Trump] accountable for bigotry, incitement, juvenile conduct and blithe contempt for the Constitution.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Representatives of the climbing outfit they were with, Seven Summit Treks, said that it appeared they suffered from altitude sickness.The two deaths are the first confirmed fatalities on Everest since 2015, when a 7.8-magnitude earthquake caused an avalanche that killed 19 people at base camp.

Amid the swirl of Trump politics it is easy to lose sight of what is important in social life. There is no shortage of media coverage about Mr. Trump's rise to become the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, his penchant for lying, his authoritarian egomania, his limited knowledge of domestic and foreign policy not to forget his shallow comprehension of the US Constitution. Here's a sample of recent headline news.Did British Prime Minister David Cameron call Mr. Trump ""stupid?"" Mr. Trump takes to the airwaves to disagree.Did Mr. Cameron invite Mr. Trump to London? Mr. Trump said he did. Mr. Cameron said he didn't.This kind of circus-like media attention is good for ratings, for advertising revenues, for circulation and for Mr. Trump. It enables Mr. Trump to spin--with ever-increasing brilliance--the myth of his invincible persona. It also seems to reinforce the growing ignorance of an ever-increasing audience of would-be voters who can't seem to separate fiction from truth or science from conspiracy, who would be hard pressed to know the location of Burkina Faso, or who equate foreign languages, especially Arabic, with threats of terrorism. This sad state of affairs would not have been possible without the aid of the corporate media. They have helped to create mythic narratives that camouflage (a) political weaknesses or (b) the real sources of power. In the game of power, as social scientists have continuously demonstrated, things are not what they seem. Mr. Trump has been playing the media with perfect pitch. Indeed, they are so besotted with the exciting notes of Mr. Trump's sweet songs there is little room for alternative melodies of global importance.There is so much ""celebrity news,"" that even in a newspaper as good as The Guardian, you have to read carefully to find stories about the plight of our planet.

In the story, environment correspondent Fiona Harvey describes the grim results of a comprehensive United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) study that involved more than 1200 scientists from 160 governments. Based upon the analysis of decades of scientific data, the study found that governments have failed to seriously confront the scourges of air pollution, the destruction of marine ecosystems, the ruin of land or the danger of water scarcity.Commenting on the report, UNEP Director Achim Steiner stated: ""If current trends continue, and the world fails to enact solutions that improve patterns of production and consumption, if we fail to use natural resources sustainably, then the state of the world's environment will continue to decline."" Ms. Harvey concludes her important story in this way:Despite the recent global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions, signed in Paris last December, carbon output continues to rise across much of the globe. The report argues that this will put a long-term strain on the ability of developing economies to feed their own people.Obscured on page 4 of one of the world's great newspapers this important news is about the future of our planet. Why is it not on the front page? Why are these issues not at the center of our political debate?Professor Noam Chomsky has recently bemoaned the absence of public sphere discussion about the growing potential of nuclear holocaust and the ever-quickening slide toward an environmental apocalypse. In a May 20th Guardian interview, Professor Chomsky discussed the current state of American presidential politics.And we haven't even talked about the worst problems: the economic problems are bad enough, as are the social problems, but far worse than these are the major threats to the survival of the human species - the threat of nuclear war and environmental catastrophe. Here, if you look at the US primaries, you have to be impressed and appalled by the utter irrationality of the species. Here are two enormous problems that have to be faced right now, and they are almost absent from the primaries. How will we react to the cataclysmic social and cultural dislocations that climate change will soon bring? How will we deal with widespread shortages of water or the disappearance of arable land? How will we confront the global spread of hunger and disease?These issues are rarely mentioned let alone discussed in corporate media coverage of the 2016 election. For Mr. Trump, of course, these are non-issues. He says that climate change is a myth--no need to worry about it. Given the media obsession with Mr. Trump's fantasy world, it is easy to push these global issues to the margins of our awareness. What happens, however, if we don't think about or plan for the inevitable: widespread social dislocation, hunger, water shortages and the spread of disease?It is clear that the corporate media are not motivated to bring these life-and-death issues to the forefront of public debate. Although politically active intellectuals like Professor Chomsky are often dismissed as pie in the sky idealists, we should never forget that scholars are the guardians of a body of knowledge that opens our eyes to the world. Scholars attempt to describe the world as it is--not like it is on TV. And yet our scientifically informed representations of the perils of climate change, conspiracy theories, anti-science prejudice, xenophobia, and racism are usually deeply buried inside newspapers or found in small circulation websites that attract relatively small audiences, which means that these efforts often don't have the reach--or the glitz-- to shape public opinion.Even so, we must go on. It is our scholarly obligation to describe powerfully and evocatively the fundamental issues that shape our being-in-the-world, our humanity. In his Guardian interview Professor Chomsky was asked why he goes on.Here's what he said:I remember the philosopher Bertrand Russell was asked why he spent his time protesting against nuclear war and getting arrested on demonstrations. Why didn't he continue to work on the serious philosophical and logical problems which have major intellectual significance? And his answer was pretty good. He said: ""Look, if I and others like me only work on those problems, there won't be anybody around to appreciate it or be interested."" Good advice for all of us!If we follow it we might be able cut through the media fog, help to unravel the Myth of Trump and begin to better protect our troubled planet."

It will announce presenter names/topics for the November evolution paradigm shift conference within two weeks -- democratically, by email to all those registered to attend the public meeting. What's more, it has added to its original list of invitees. Zoologists perhaps at last conceding viruses belong in the tent? I understand that many of those in the Royal Society audience will be scientists as prominent as (and possibly more prominent than) some of the speakers, and as evolutionary science continues to be a tribal matter, it is expected to be a lively meeting. As for whether it will be an effective meeting, i.e., whether deep divisions can be bridged -- I'm optimistic. I am reminded of something Markus Nordberg, CERN's savvy chief of Resources Development, once told me about the strategy of organizing such meetings:""When you invite friends of the friends, they don't argue too much . . . so that at least you have a little bit of critical mass . . . but then you have to expose it. That is to say, you organize a public meeting where the enemies of the friends are invited . . . it's polarized . . . people mix like hot and cold water. And that's the point at which you are able to set up a collaboration."" However, grumblings about paradigm shift are coming not only from ""the enemies,"" i.e., the usual suspects (who are likely to send their disruptive ""representatives"" to the London gathering) -- but from more measured, responsible voices like Indiana University biologist Michael Lynch. Lynch recently responded to my story about the Extended Synthesis crowd who've now been funded by Templeton with $8M but still can't agree on a definition for Extended Synthesis  with this note:  ""Superficial, silly, shallow-minded, self-promotional. I and many others view this as a complete embarrassment to the field. If one wishes to extend something in public, especially as a biologist, one ought to have a very good idea of what is being extended.""Even Stan Salthe, one of evolution's long-time progressive voices is dissatisfied with the fuzziness of language, emailing:""Philosophically, the only difference between the earlier (new) synthesis and the new (extended) one is that the new one downgrades random mutation as the only source of new departures, allowing the biological system to potentially have some agency in its evolution during ontogeny."" There are some, in fact, who think the whole thing is a game of semantics and that I've ""been had"" regarding my interest. Denis Noble, point man for the Royal Society conference, further addressed the matter of evolutionary science word play in a recent email to me:""One of the problems I see in this field of evolutionary biology is that there are now a variety of definitions of what the neo-Darwinist Modern Synthesis includes. A recent reply to my J Exp Biol article even includes the inheritance of acquired characteristics! But if we define the Modern Synthesis as its original formulation to exclude the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which was Weizmann's intention, which was followed by many others and summarized by Mayr, then the ES must be a replacement not simply an extension and it is so by definition. No doubt the virosphere is implied, as well, somewhere in Denis Noble's above ""extended ellipsis.""  Clearly, the Extended Synthesis does not go far enough in reflecting current evidence. The last major Extended Synthesis paper by Gerd Müller -- one of the fathers of the Extended Synthesis, who will be at the November gathering to explain his latest ES position -- was, e.g., virtually virus-free (the word virus appears one time). Santa Fe Institute physicist Geoffrey West thinks the hard sciences definitely need to be factored into the equation at the November meeting. And Adrian Bejan, author of The Physics of Life, will attend to make sure they are.Other prominent scientists who've registered include biosemiotics ambassador Kalevi Kull, and plant physiologist/ambassador František Baluška. Michael Joyner from Mayo Clinic and John Torday from UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine will bring their medical perspective to the gathering, as will neurobiologist and developmental psychologist Jonathan Delafield-Butt, who's now busily organizing his own conference in Scotland on autism.I would expect both former Royal Society president Sir Paul Nurse and current president Sir Venki Ramakrishnan to waft in at some point during the three-day affair. And that there will no doubt be tributes (whether formal or informal) to some of evolution's revolutionaries, now gone: Mae-Wan Ho, Lynn Margulis and Carl Woese.But it may well be the presence of science historian and dramatist Richard Milner -- currently promoting the life of Alfred Russell Wallace -- with his repertoire of disarming songs, such as ""I'm a Genius,"" that proves most crucial to the November proceedings, that is, if chairs really do begin flying. . ."

How many Fox News watchers, for instance, spent an equal amount of time with MSNBC? And how many fans of Michael Signorelli regularly listened to Rush Limbaugh? Is it possible that we were already fragmented and refractory, and Facebook has just made that more visible? Bruni maintains that ""we're sorting ourselves with a chillingly ruthless efficiency.

They mark, roughly, the western and eastern edges of the Islamic State. Both cities are presently the scenes of important battles for control that will help determine the future of the Islamic State, and by extension, the current Syrian and Iraqi governments; and currently, both battles are going badly for Washington and its allies.Aleppo is the second largest city in Syria. For the last four years it has been contested by the Free Syrian Army, various Jihadist groups, including the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusrah Front, and the Assad government. At one point during the summer of 2015, it seemed that the Free Syrian Army was on the verge of taking control of the city and expelling the pro-Assad Syrian Army and its militias. The loss of Aleppo would have been a significant setback for the Assad government. It might well have marked the beginning of the end for the Assad dynasty in Syria.Some nine months later, following the intervention of Russian military forces in support of the Syrian government, the situation is sharply reversed. It is the Free Syrian Army that now finds itself largely surrounded and, its recent successes notwithstanding, in danger of collapsing. Its lifeline to Turkey is almost entirely closed off, while Syrian troops, supported by Russian air power and Russian Special Forces units, are steadily drawing a noose around Aleppo's beleaguered defenders.In the meantime, the Obama Administration continues to play out the farce that it is engaging with Russia to organize a ceasefire and craft a political solution to end the Syrian Civil War. The Syrian ceasefire is failing because neither Damascus nor Moscow has any interest in maintaining it or in crafting a political solution to end the fighting in Syria. Indeed, the Kremlin has already made it clear what it considers an acceptable political solution: the continuation of the Assad government, an unspecified role for the ""moderate"" Syrian rebels in an Assad administration and a combined Russian-American effort to eradicate Islamic State and other radical jihadist groups. To his credit Vladimir Putin is well on his way to accomplishing exactly what he said he was going to do. A lesson that is not lost on Russia's allies in the Middle East nor on America's.The Syrian government always had the advantage when it came to air power. Modest as its air forces were, they was still more than those possessed by the Free Syrian Army. They had none to speak of. Russian air power, however, tipped the balance of military power decisively in favor of the Assad government. After a rocky start, the combination of Syrian ground troops and Russian air forces have proven to be an effective and lethal combination. In Aleppo they have steadily worn down the Free Syrian Army and its Islamist allies. At this point, barring a dramatic change in battlefield conditions, it is only a question of time until Assad's troops prevail in the Battle of Aleppo. Washington had an opportunity to declare a no-fly zone over the Syrian battlefield prior to Russia's intervention. Syrian rebel groups were asking for a no-fly zone as early as 2011. In February 2014, UN Security Council Resolution 2139 demanded an end to attacks on civilians and called for ""further steps in the case of non-compliance."" This was widely interpreted as a call for a no fly zone. The Obama Administration, however, demurred. A no-fly zone at this point would have shifted the military balance in favor of the Syrian rebels.Following the Russian intervention, the Obama White House was quick to declare that ""it would not cooperate"" with Moscow's aims and that the Kremlin's actions would lead Russia into a ""quagmire"" and further aggravate the crisis in the Middle East. The Obama Administration continued to insist that a resolution of the Syrian Civil War would require the departure of Bashar al-Assad. At the same time, however, the White House made it clear that it would not challenge Russian air power over Syria, and while it would continue to supply arms to the Free Syrian Army, it would not attack the Syrian Army or defend the Free Syrian Army from Russian attacks. Disposition of Syrian rebel and Syrian Army forces in Aleppo, Spring 2016. Pink: Syrian Army Froces, Green: Syrian Rebels, Grey: Islamic State.The outcome was predictable. Bolstered by Russian air power, the Assad government steadily tipped the military balance in its favor. It was clear by the winter of 2015, that in the absence of any concerted US action, only a Turkish ground invasion would save the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo from being surrounded and overrun. A Turkish ground invasion, however, would have required American air cover to be successful. After toying with the idea the Obama administration opted not to participate. Instead the White House agreed to the Russian proposal for a ceasefire. A ceasefire that was little more than a façade to forestall a Turkish intervention and to give political cover to Washington and save it from the embarrassment of having a bankrupt policy clearly exposed. While the ceasefire may have diminished, somewhat, the intensity of the fighting in Syria, it did little to stop the fighting for Aleppo. Instead, whenever world opinion reaches a crescendo, Russia, aided by the United States, trots out the prospect of a new ceasefire until the outrage over the carnage in Syria diminishes sufficiently for Moscow and Damascus to return to business as usual. The Kremlin is not yet ready to declare victory in the Syrian Civil War, but it has made considerable progress in redefining the political landscape in Syria. It is now inconceivable that there is any scenario in the future of Syria that will not include the continued involvement of Bashar al-Assad. For the United States and its allies the choice is increasingly one between accepting the continuation of the Assad regime, albeit possibly with some participation of the Syrian rebels, or aligning itself with radical jihadist elements to overthrow Assad. Given that those jihadist groups include organizations that are mortal enemies of the United Stated, it's clear there is little choice. Three hundred miles away, another battle is gearing up. This one for Mosul, once the second largest city in Iraq, with a population of around two million people. Today it is around a quarter of that. The city has been largely surrounded, with all of the major roads, except for Highway 1 to Baji, blocked. Iraqi troops and Shiite militias have been advancing from the south, while Peshmerga forces have held defensive positions to the north, east and west of the city. As of May 22, Iraqi troops were contesting the village of Al Qayyarah, about 22 miles south of Mosul and about 5 miles east of the junction with Highway 1. Al Qayyarah also hosts a former Iraqi Air Force base (Saddam Air Base), about 15 miles due west of the town. The air base, now known as Qayyarah West Airfield, is a major facility. Its runways can accommodate a C-5 Galaxy, and the air base can serve as a major supply point during the upcoming battle for Mosul.  Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.The US has quietly built up its deployment in the area in support of the Iraqi offensive. It's unclear what the total American ground presence in Iraq is, but it is certainly higher than the authorized limit of 3,870, the official estimate previously circulated by the Pentagon. The actual number of US troops on the ground is estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000. In addition, notwithstanding the Obama White House's insistence that the American troops are in Iraq in an advisory and training role, Marine General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has confirmed in Congressional testimony that US troops are actively involved in combat roles. US Special Forces are involved in training and advising their Iraqi counterparts, and they are also carrying out their own missions independent of the Iraqi military. In addition the US has established a fire base (Fire Base Bell/Kara Soar Counter Fire Complex) near Makhmour to provide artillery support for Iraqi troops. The fire base hosts four 155 mm howitzers and is manned by approximately 200 Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Pentagon has indicated that it is open to establishing more fire bases in northern Iraq as needed. The Marines at Fire Base Bell are soon going to be replaced by members of the 101st Airborne from Fort Campbell, Kentucky.Despite the appearance of steady progress, privately US military officials have expressed serious misgivings about the upcoming battle for Mosul. What role the Shiite militias will play has not been settled. The US has been adamant that Shia militias would not be involved in the liberation of Mosul. The radical Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr, widely seen as an Iranian proxy in Iraq, has, on the other hand, demanded a role for his official militia, the Saraya al-Salam (Peace Brigades).  Russian Sukhoi conducting an attack in SyriaThe Peace Brigades are a part of a broader grouping of Shia militias known as the Popular Mobilization Unit, which was organized in June 2014, following the routing of the Iraqi Army by Islamic State militants. The group also includes the Hezbollah Brigades, Asaib al-Haq (Righteous League), Harakat Nujaba (Movement of the Noble), Saraya Khorasan (Khorasan Brigades) and the Iman Ali Brigades. All of these groups are hostile to the US and have received arms, financing and training by Iranian Revolutionary Guards. The Hezbollah Brigades are classified as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department and many of the leaders of the other militias are listed as foreign terrorists. On April 30, thousands of supporters of al-Sadr burst into the heavily defended, supposedly impenetrable, Green Zone, and occupied the Iraqi Parliament, as well as a number of other government buildings. The protest was triggered by al-Sadr's repeated calls to end the endemic corruption in the Iraqi government, hold early elections and improve the delivery of government social services to Iraqis. Al-Sadr has also been demanding an end to the political quota system originally set up by the US. The abolishment of the quota system would further marginalize Iraq's Sunni and Kurdish populations. On May 20, al-Sadr supporters again invaded the Green Zone, the latest incident in what is now a recurring pattern of weekly Friday protests against the Baghdad government. This time they were dispersed by tear gas before they could occupy any buildings. Initially, the occupation of the Iraqi Parliament by al-Sadr's supporters was seen as a potential coup attempt. Those fears were abated when the protestors peacefully disbanded the next day. Although the protestors did not specifically cite the role of the Shia militias in the liberation of Mosul, the lesson was not lost on the government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Muqtada al-Sadr is rapidly emerging as the de facto king maker in Baghdad. Attempts to exclude the Shia militias from the upcoming battle for Mosul will simply add to the instability and deadlock that is already gripping the Baghdad government.How the combination of Iraqi military, Shia militias and Kurdish Peshmerga forces will collaborate remains to be seen. The initial plan floated by US military officials was for Peshmerga forces to assume defensive roles to the north, east and west of Mosul and control the major roads from the city, while Iraqi military forces advanced from the south. The Shiite militias are wild cards that will complicate this strategy. They will not take direction from US military officials nor does the US want to use them. Under the direction of their Iranian Revolutionary Guard advisors, they may execute their own battle strategy; one that may well put them at odds with the American-led effort. Already there have been a number of clashes between Kurdish troops and Shia militias in the area.The Battle for Mosul will require both a military plan and a political one. Without a political consensus on who will fight the battle, what role each party will play and most importantly what the post-ISIS disposition of Mosul is going to be, any military strategy risks falling apart to political feuding. Moreover, the political solution regarding the Battle for Mosul risks becoming an additional factor destabilizing the Baghdad government. Militarily, the battle for Mosul can be won without having a political solution in place, but it will make fighting such a battle harder, longer and far more complicated than it would otherwise be.Finally, there is the issue of the Iraqi Army's battlefield performance. To date, to put it charitably, it has been mixed. Some elements of the Iraqi Army, especially the US trained Special Forces have performed well. Other units have not. On March 19, for example, Marine Sargent Louis Cardin, 27, was killed and eight other Marines were injured at Fire Base Bell by Islamic State mortar attacks. The IS militants were able to advance within range of the fire base when the Iraqi troops defending the base abandoned their positions in response to attacks by Islamic State forces.  Australian Army trainer with the Iraqi 23rd Army Brigade.The current US effort in support of Iraqi forces is much more substantial and much more focused than previous efforts. In addition to the US troops on the ground and the artillery support at Fire Base Bell, it appears that the US has imbedded forward air controllers with Peshmerga and Iraqi units to better coordinate air support. It still falls on the Iraqi Army, however, to fight Islamic State militants for the eventual control of Mosul. The question of whether the Iraqi military is up to that fight remains unanswered, as does the issue of whether a political consensus on how the battle for Mosul will be fought can be reached. Two cities, two battles--the one for Aleppo now entering a decisive phase, while the one for Mosul is just beginning. In Aleppo, a US ally is being decimated while Washington, having ceded the initiative in Syria to Moscow, stands by. In Mosul the absence of a political consensus means the battle will be long, difficult and far more complicated than it needs to be.The Obama Administration wants to project the image that it has a sophisticated, nuanced view of events in the Middle East, a view tempered by history and part of a well thought out, long-term plan to disengage the US from the region while bringing it the stability of a balance of power among the various nations there. Criticism of the Administration is dismissed by President Obama as ""mumbo jumbo,"" and his critics as would be hawks with a hopelessly naïve view of Middle East realities. The fact is that the inability and the unwillingness of the Obama White House to act to reduce the violence tearing the region apart has created a far bigger crisis and a far greater humanitarian toll, one that will ultimately have far graver consequences for the US and its allies. A faster, more focused response, like a no-fly zone over Syria back in 2014, or a more determined effort to crush Islamic State, especially to destroy its financial resources, would have contained the crisis and the violence it is spewing far better. Instead, the Administration's policy in Syria and Iraq has consistently been one of hesitancy and indecision. Washington is finally getting around to crafting a more effective response and, while more successful, it is generally one of too little, too late. This is not an Administration with a long view of Middle East realities, this is not a White House with a nuanced and sophisticated view of Middle East affairs. This is a government that has demonstrated by it policies to be, frankly, clueless."

They mark, roughly, the western and eastern edges of the Islamic State. Both cities are presently the scenes of important battles for control that will help determine the future of the Islamic State, and by extension, the current Syrian and Iraqi governments; and currently, both battles are going badly for Washington and its allies.Aleppo is the second largest city in Syria. For the last four years it has been contested by the Free Syrian Army, various Jihadist groups, including the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusrah Front, and the Assad government. At one point during the summer of 2015, it seemed that the Free Syrian Army was on the verge of taking control of the city and expelling the pro-Assad Syrian Army and its militias. The loss of Aleppo would have been a significant setback for the Assad government. It might well have marked the beginning of the end for the Assad dynasty in Syria.Some nine months later, following the intervention of Russian military forces in support of the Syrian government, the situation is sharply reversed. It is the Free Syrian Army that now finds itself largely surrounded and, its recent successes notwithstanding, in danger of collapsing. Its lifeline to Turkey is almost entirely closed off, while Syrian troops, supported by Russian air power and Russian Special Forces units, are steadily drawing a noose around Aleppo's beleaguered defenders.In the meantime, the Obama Administration continues to play out the farce that it is engaging with Russia to organize a ceasefire and craft a political solution to end the Syrian Civil War. The Syrian ceasefire is failing because neither Damascus nor Moscow has any interest in maintaining it or in crafting a political solution to end the fighting in Syria. Indeed, the Kremlin has already made it clear what it considers an acceptable political solution: the continuation of the Assad government, an unspecified role for the ""moderate"" Syrian rebels in an Assad administration and a combined Russian-American effort to eradicate Islamic State and other radical jihadist groups. To his credit Vladimir Putin is well on his way to accomplishing exactly what he said he was going to do. A lesson that is not lost on Russia's allies in the Middle East nor on America's.The Syrian government always had the advantage when it came to air power. Modest as its air forces were, they was still more than those possessed by the Free Syrian Army. They had none to speak of. Russian air power, however, tipped the balance of military power decisively in favor of the Assad government. After a rocky start, the combination of Syrian ground troops and Russian air forces have proven to be an effective and lethal combination. In Aleppo they have steadily worn down the Free Syrian Army and its Islamist allies. At this point, barring a dramatic change in battlefield conditions, it is only a question of time until Assad's troops prevail in the Battle of Aleppo. Washington had an opportunity to declare a no-fly zone over the Syrian battlefield prior to Russia's intervention. Syrian rebel groups were asking for a no-fly zone as early as 2011. In February 2014, UN Security Council Resolution 2139 demanded an end to attacks on civilians and called for ""further steps in the case of non-compliance."" This was widely interpreted as a call for a no fly zone. The Obama Administration, however, demurred. A no-fly zone at this point would have shifted the military balance in favor of the Syrian rebels.Following the Russian intervention, the Obama White House was quick to declare that ""it would not cooperate"" with Moscow's aims and that the Kremlin's actions would lead Russia into a ""quagmire"" and further aggravate the crisis in the Middle East. The Obama Administration continued to insist that a resolution of the Syrian Civil War would require the departure of Bashar al-Assad. At the same time, however, the White House made it clear that it would not challenge Russian air power over Syria, and while it would continue to supply arms to the Free Syrian Army, it would not attack the Syrian Army or defend the Free Syrian Army from Russian attacks. Disposition of Syrian rebel and Syrian Army forces in Aleppo, Spring 2016. Pink: Syrian Army Froces, Green: Syrian Rebels, Grey: Islamic State.The outcome was predictable. Bolstered by Russian air power, the Assad government steadily tipped the military balance in its favor. It was clear by the winter of 2015, that in the absence of any concerted US action, only a Turkish ground invasion would save the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo from being surrounded and overrun. A Turkish ground invasion, however, would have required American air cover to be successful. After toying with the idea the Obama administration opted not to participate. Instead the White House agreed to the Russian proposal for a ceasefire. A ceasefire that was little more than a façade to forestall a Turkish intervention and to give political cover to Washington and save it from the embarrassment of having a bankrupt policy clearly exposed. While the ceasefire may have diminished, somewhat, the intensity of the fighting in Syria, it did little to stop the fighting for Aleppo. Instead, whenever world opinion reaches a crescendo, Russia, aided by the United States, trots out the prospect of a new ceasefire until the outrage over the carnage in Syria diminishes sufficiently for Moscow and Damascus to return to business as usual. The Kremlin is not yet ready to declare victory in the Syrian Civil War, but it has made considerable progress in redefining the political landscape in Syria. It is now inconceivable that there is any scenario in the future of Syria that will not include the continued involvement of Bashar al-Assad. For the United States and its allies the choice is increasingly one between accepting the continuation of the Assad regime, albeit possibly with some participation of the Syrian rebels, or aligning itself with radical jihadist elements to overthrow Assad. Given that those jihadist groups include organizations that are mortal enemies of the United Stated, it's clear there is little choice. Three hundred miles away, another battle is gearing up. This one for Mosul, once the second largest city in Iraq, with a population of around two million people. Today it is around a quarter of that. The city has been largely surrounded, with all of the major roads, except for Highway 1 to Baji, blocked. Iraqi troops and Shiite militias have been advancing from the south, while Peshmerga forces have held defensive positions to the north, east and west of the city. As of May 22, Iraqi troops were contesting the village of Al Qayyarah, about 22 miles south of Mosul and about 5 miles east of the junction with Highway 1. Al Qayyarah also hosts a former Iraqi Air Force base (Saddam Air Base), about 15 miles due west of the town. The air base, now known as Qayyarah West Airfield, is a major facility. Its runways can accommodate a C-5 Galaxy, and the air base can serve as a major supply point during the upcoming battle for Mosul.  Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.The US has quietly built up its deployment in the area in support of the Iraqi offensive. It's unclear what the total American ground presence in Iraq is, but it is certainly higher than the authorized limit of 3,870, the official estimate previously circulated by the Pentagon. The actual number of US troops on the ground is estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000. In addition, notwithstanding the Obama White House's insistence that the American troops are in Iraq in an advisory and training role, Marine General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has confirmed in Congressional testimony that US troops are actively involved in combat roles. US Special Forces are involved in training and advising their Iraqi counterparts, and they are also carrying out their own missions independent of the Iraqi military. In addition the US has established a fire base (Fire Base Bell/Kara Soar Counter Fire Complex) near Makhmour to provide artillery support for Iraqi troops. The fire base hosts four 155 mm howitzers and is manned by approximately 200 Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Pentagon has indicated that it is open to establishing more fire bases in northern Iraq as needed. The Marines at Fire Base Bell are soon going to be replaced by members of the 101st Airborne from Fort Campbell, Kentucky.Despite the appearance of steady progress, privately US military officials have expressed serious misgivings about the upcoming battle for Mosul. What role the Shiite militias will play has not been settled. The US has been adamant that Shia militias would not be involved in the liberation of Mosul. The radical Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr, widely seen as an Iranian proxy in Iraq, has, on the other hand, demanded a role for his official militia, the Saraya al-Salam (Peace Brigades).  Russian Sukhoi conducting an attack in SyriaThe Peace Brigades are a part of a broader grouping of Shia militias known as the Popular Mobilization Unit, which was organized in June 2014, following the routing of the Iraqi Army by Islamic State militants. The group also includes the Hezbollah Brigades, Asaib al-Haq (Righteous League), Harakat Nujaba (Movement of the Noble), Saraya Khorasan (Khorasan Brigades) and the Iman Ali Brigades. All of these groups are hostile to the US and have received arms, financing and training by Iranian Revolutionary Guards. The Hezbollah Brigades are classified as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department and many of the leaders of the other militias are listed as foreign terrorists. On April 30, thousands of supporters of al-Sadr burst into the heavily defended, supposedly impenetrable, Green Zone, and occupied the Iraqi Parliament, as well as a number of other government buildings. The protest was triggered by al-Sadr's repeated calls to end the endemic corruption in the Iraqi government, hold early elections and improve the delivery of government social services to Iraqis. Al-Sadr has also been demanding an end to the political quota system originally set up by the US. The abolishment of the quota system would further marginalize Iraq's Sunni and Kurdish populations. On May 20, al-Sadr supporters again invaded the Green Zone, the latest incident in what is now a recurring pattern of weekly Friday protests against the Baghdad government. This time they were dispersed by tear gas before they could occupy any buildings. Initially, the occupation of the Iraqi Parliament by al-Sadr's supporters was seen as a potential coup attempt. Those fears were abated when the protestors peacefully disbanded the next day. Although the protestors did not specifically cite the role of the Shia militias in the liberation of Mosul, the lesson was not lost on the government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Muqtada al-Sadr is rapidly emerging as the de facto king maker in Baghdad. Attempts to exclude the Shia militias from the upcoming battle for Mosul will simply add to the instability and deadlock that is already gripping the Baghdad government.How the combination of Iraqi military, Shia militias and Kurdish Peshmerga forces will collaborate remains to be seen. The initial plan floated by US military officials was for Peshmerga forces to assume defensive roles to the north, east and west of Mosul and control the major roads from the city, while Iraqi military forces advanced from the south. The Shiite militias are wild cards that will complicate this strategy. They will not take direction from US military officials nor does the US want to use them. Under the direction of their Iranian Revolutionary Guard advisors, they may execute their own battle strategy; one that may well put them at odds with the American-led effort. Already there have been a number of clashes between Kurdish troops and Shia militias in the area.The Battle for Mosul will require both a military plan and a political one. Without a political consensus on who will fight the battle, what role each party will play and most importantly what the post-ISIS disposition of Mosul is going to be, any military strategy risks falling apart to political feuding. Moreover, the political solution regarding the Battle for Mosul risks becoming an additional factor destabilizing the Baghdad government. Militarily, the battle for Mosul can be won without having a political solution in place, but it will make fighting such a battle harder, longer and far more complicated than it would otherwise be.Finally, there is the issue of the Iraqi Army's battlefield performance. To date, to put it charitably, it has been mixed. Some elements of the Iraqi Army, especially the US trained Special Forces have performed well. Other units have not. On March 19, for example, Marine Sargent Louis Cardin, 27, was killed and eight other Marines were injured at Fire Base Bell by Islamic State mortar attacks. The IS militants were able to advance within range of the fire base when the Iraqi troops defending the base abandoned their positions in response to attacks by Islamic State forces.  Australian Army trainer with the Iraqi 23rd Army Brigade.The current US effort in support of Iraqi forces is much more substantial and much more focused than previous efforts. In addition to the US troops on the ground and the artillery support at Fire Base Bell, it appears that the US has imbedded forward air controllers with Peshmerga and Iraqi units to better coordinate air support. It still falls on the Iraqi Army, however, to fight Islamic State militants for the eventual control of Mosul. The question of whether the Iraqi military is up to that fight remains unanswered, as does the issue of whether a political consensus on how the battle for Mosul will be fought can be reached. Two cities, two battles--the one for Aleppo now entering a decisive phase, while the one for Mosul is just beginning. In Aleppo, a US ally is being decimated while Washington, having ceded the initiative in Syria to Moscow, stands by. In Mosul the absence of a political consensus means the battle will be long, difficult and far more complicated than it needs to be.The Obama Administration wants to project the image that it has a sophisticated, nuanced view of events in the Middle East, a view tempered by history and part of a well thought out, long-term plan to disengage the US from the region while bringing it the stability of a balance of power among the various nations there. Criticism of the Administration is dismissed by President Obama as ""mumbo jumbo,"" and his critics as would be hawks with a hopelessly naïve view of Middle East realities. The fact is that the inability and the unwillingness of the Obama White House to act to reduce the violence tearing the region apart has created a far bigger crisis and a far greater humanitarian toll, one that will ultimately have far graver consequences for the US and its allies. A faster, more focused response, like a no-fly zone over Syria back in 2014, or a more determined effort to crush Islamic State, especially to destroy its financial resources, would have contained the crisis and the violence it is spewing far better.

I have the privilege to be participating in this unique event, convened by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, which will bring together world leaders and humanitarian-aid organizations to discuss how we can do more to alleviate human suffering across the globe.By most metrics, conflicts have become significantly more frequent and violent in recent years. According to the UN, there were 409 political conflicts around the world in 2015, up from 278 a decade prior. This has contributed to the largest human displacement since World War II, with over 60 million people -- about half of them children -- forced from their homes because of violence. But despite the staggering need for humanitarian aid -- the UN will request $20 billion in 2016, up from only $5 billion in 2006 -- only 55 percent of the financing target for life-saving humanitarian assistance was met last year.These numbers all tell the same story: our approach to humanitarian aid needs to be revisited.This is why the World Humanitarian Summit promises to be such an important event. Not only will nations and organizations renew their commitment to investing in humanity and meeting worldwide aid requirements, but more importantly, the Summit will help guide the international community toward a more sustainable, a more human-centered approach to aid. In convening the World Humanitarian Summit, the Secretary-General is calling on leaders, NGOs and vulnerable communities to work together in order to eliminate the need for humanitarian aid before crises even arise.The challenge of our time is to shift from spending money on mitigating conflicts to spending money on preventing conflicts. This will demand new, innovative thinking, and it will require a significant investment in building the capacities and infrastructures of vulnerable regions -- making sure that individuals in fragile communities have the education and tools they need to create safe, vibrant societies. The costs and effort will be significant, but we will be laying the groundwork for real, sustainable peace. And it is far cheaper in the long run to invest in conflict prevention today than in conflict mitigation tomorrow: the UNDP estimates that every $1 in prevention can save $10 in future costs.This idea that we have to invest in and empower communities to build peace from the ground up is at the core of the work being done by my foundation, the Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative. We operate in communities impacted by conflict -- from South Sudan to Tijuana, Mexico -- and work with youth leaders to develop their abilities to mediate conflicts and build projects that provide important social services and economic opportunities for at-risk youth in their communities. In working with these extraordinary young women and men from all over the world, I have seen their passion for peace building and how capably they work together to make life better for their friends, families, and neighbors. If we could empower more individuals on a larger scale, the benefits to humanity would be staggering.My goal for the World Humanitarian Summit is to share some of the work our youth peacemakers have been doing and to join the discussion on how we can engage more young people as peace and community builders. Time and time again, I have seen WPDI youth peacemakers come together in the face of tremendous obstacles to create powerful transformations. I believe that when the international community comes together in a similar way to support vulnerable communities throughout the world -- a process that begins tomorrow in Istanbul -- we will be able to accomplish extraordinary things.Please join me over the next two days as I chronicle my experiences at the World Humanitarian Summit.

44,POLITICS,How Iran Dominates the Middle East? Soft Power,"Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, ContributorPresident of the International American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-iran-dominates-the-mi_b_10089658.html,,2016-05-22,2016-03-12-1457793374-8912173-ScreenShot20160310at4.38.54PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-12-1457793374-8912173-ScreenShot20160310at4.38.54PM-thumb.png,"The mainstream media and politicians have emphasized Iran's hard power, military capacity and its army's role in the Middle East, which is part of Tehran's expansionist policies. The emphasis is warranted.Nevertheless, focusing solely on Iran's hard power and military capacity is misplaced. By dedicating all their resources and concentrating on Iran's military capacity, regional and global powers are running the risk of falling into the Iranian government's political trap which is what exactly Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and the high commanders of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) aim for.It is accurate to argue that governments around the region should take the Islamic Republic's military capacity as well as the IRGC and Quds forces' expansions in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen seriously. However, Iran still exerts a significant amount of non-military influence in the region, and continues to expand it, through manipulation of various soft power tactics.But it is crucial to point out that although Iran's major strategies of deploying successful soft power resources remain intact, there is going to be a new trend and tactical shift. Iranian leaders are delighted to make noise about their military power, bandwagon on the success of Shiite militias, take credit, and launch missiles to project their power, exaggerate it, and in order to shift the focus from their real goals of exerting influence and having a say in the domestic politics of neighboring countries.Militarily speaking, Iranian leaders are cognizant of the fact that they are not a match for the American military or other regional powers. The US can easily inflict significant damage and even cripple Iran's military infrastructure in matter of weeks. Being aware of that, however, the Islamic Republic continues to project its military power in order to steer attention away from the real issues.Manipulation of soft powerFirst of all, Iran's soft power strategies are long-term oriented. As an Iranian official once said to me, the reason behind Iran's growing presence in the region despite the sanctions and isolation were ""soft power accompanied with patience"".The Islamic republic was established with almost no allies in the region. During the subsequent decades, they managed, with minimal cost to dominate Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as have proxies in other countries in the region, such as Bahrain and Yemen. If this trends continues, in 10 or 20 years, the number of these proxies and Iran's influence in the region will absolutely increase.Before sanctions were lifted, Iran focused primarily on manipulating and capitalizing on the grievances of other groups, building alliances with them, showing them they share the same ideological views (such opposing Israel, opposing their government, helping them topple the Sunni majority government, opposing the United States, etc.)Iran's soft power is not only theological but also ideological. Tehran does not only focus on building alliances with Shiites in order to exert its influence in the region and interfere in the domestic politics of countries. For example, Tehran is currently forming strong relationships with some Kurdish Sunni groups by demonstrating to them that Iran shares the same grievances with them.After building alliances with these groups and forming a united public opinion, Tehran then assists them in becoming political realities in those nations in order to exert its influence through the ""legitimate"" political institutions of that country. In this case, if the government of that particular nation is overthrown, Iran's proxy is well-placed to take over (such as in Iraq).Even if the government is not overthrown, that government will think twice about reacting to Iran (such as Lebanon's government and Hezbollah). Secondly, Iran's soft power is multi-layered and sophisticated, encompassing several governmental organizations.Iran also continues to use other strategies including cultural, educational and religious institutions, such as training powerful Shiite religious figures from other countries in Qum, establishing thousands of seminaries, giving scholarships and fellowships to foreigners to come and study Shiism in Iran, establishing Iranian studies programs in other countries, promoting the Persian language, investing in Arabic and English news outlets (such as Press TV, Al Alam, Al Kawthar), pioneering investments in religious films- which advances Iran's political version of Islam.Third, Iran's soft power is coherent and well-organized, although it might not always produce the outcome that Tehran desires (For example, some instances of tension with Hamas).As one can see, Iran used both top-down and bottom-up approach to utilize its soft power and exert influence before sanctions were lifted. The emphasis at this time was more on the bottom- up approach. But Iran's priorities in soft power strategies have tactically shifted due to the sanctions reliefs and its application of hard power._______________________Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is an American political scientist, business advisor, US foreign policy, Iran and Middle East expert, and the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

It was 24 years ago today, May 22, 1992, when Bosnia & Herzegovina (BiH) became a member of the United Nations, and I was appointed its first Ambassador. Then was a time of high expectations as well as urgency. The Berlin Wall had just been torn down, but BiH was being engulfed by conflict that appeared to be the last gasps of an authoritarian system suddenly transforming itself from communist to nationalist-fascist. However, few thought that after the collapse of the Soviet Union that new walls would become the currency of political exploiters, whether Austria, Myanmar, Syria, or U.S. (Read: ""Putin Drops the Bombs & Deals the Cards in Syria & Ukraine"") BiH's admission to the UN was the reborn state's first diplomatic success in an effort to confront a war of aggression from outside and a divisive-fascist assault from within upon a centuries-old tradition of diversity and co-existence. As Sarajevo, BiH's capital and its institutions, were besieged and already in the early stages of an effort to strangle and ethnically cleanse all of its Bosniak (Muslim), Bosnian Croat (Catholic) and all others who would oppose the war and killing for homogenization, I became the voice and face of a country in which I was born, even if I was most American in my personal and political culture -- one might say that I was the coincidental Ambassador designated by necessity. As one trained in law and having succeeded as an investment banker, the challenge did not appear beyond reach. Most importantly, the US with its multi-ethnic values just enshrined in the face of obstinate segregationists appeared an ideal political and economic model to suppress those waging violence against ""the other"" as well as diversity. The new Europe, with millions now freed from the yoke of Soviet domination and facing the challenge of integrating newer potential members and older generations of immigrants, needed more bridges even as the walls collapsed. The struggle of Bosnia was not an isolated conflict between rival religions or ethnic groups but a defining battle between the new vision versus the old fears and their mongers. Stereotypes & Cliches as Weapons of Wall Builders:  However, from the outset BiH's and my greatest enemy were stereotypes, and the effort to exploit such by those who did not have the vision and/or will to confront hate mongers. Having failed to dissuade Slobodan Milosevic, (then Serbia's strongman), and his agents, the language of ethnic divides was adopted by mediators and much of international diplomacy. The conflict started to be described in the cliches of ""age-old hatreds"" and ""millennium-old wars"" as if the mediators were tackling flawed genetics and history. Of course, many of these same mediators and diplomats had come from a European continent that had seemingly overcome its own ugly cliches and narratives to erase suspicions and wars in favor of a new European vision.

While Sarajevo was defended by a multi-ethnic army of newly minted citizen soldiers, our diplomatic UN outpost took on volunteers: Serb, Croat, Jewish, Bosniak, American, or simply global citizens, (before the term was ever coined), who saw both an existential struggle and one beyond BiH that could and would define the course for so much more across and within borders. The persons who worked in our mission, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, agnostic, atheist or Muslim, seemed to better represent not only tolerance but the advantages of diversity in action. However, it was expedient back then to define all Serbs (Orthodox Christians) as represented by Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and war-lord Ratko Mladic, thus legitimizing only them as negotiating partners rather than treating them as the carriers of contagious nationalism-populism that would spread, contaminate and infect its fascism, including to non-Serbs. Not Victims - Strength in Diversity Rather than Weakness in Reciprocity to Hate:Our diverse UN Embassy, and not just my personal American culture and tone were probably one of the more disconcerting testimonies to the stereotypes and cliches. This was not though just in New York City but also back in BiH where the ""Miss Besieged Sarajevo"" pageant tore down barriers in people's perceptions. (Read: ""Diplomatic Bluff to Break the Longest Modern Siege..."") As hard as some would try to break us down into such delineations, our resistance to resort to ethnic or religious descriptions of the conflict or at least its causes frustrated both the enemy and those presumably tasked with mediation. Ironically or perhaps not, the efforts of the ultra-nationalist, fascist to paint the conflict as ethnic or religious coincided with that of many presumed mediators. While the targets were defined by their ethnicity or religion as means to promote complicity as well as their ideology of exclusion, this strategy would only be truly successful if there were a reciprocity in hate and intolerance. If the resolutions to the conflict were primarily crafted in ethnic/religious terms, this both legitimized the extremists and fashioned a solution on their terms. These were no more Serb champions than Islam is represented by ISIS, (Watch - @ Terror in Bosnia) American or European Christian by the Klan and ""Far Right,"" Jews by the JDL, Buddhists by ""696"" or Hindus by.... -- well, are we all becoming caricatures in a reversion to conflict? There was also another stereotype that we did not wish to fulfill, that of victim. Perhaps it was in part my American manner and legal training, but the assumptions that BiH was asking for something beyond an inalienable right or that it was doomed to fall had to be challenged. The even greater courage, ingenuity and persistence of BiH's defenders and citizens rebuffed the predictions of inevitable defeat -- but without the weapons or assistance lifting the sieges and liberation were also not probable, at least not without so many more killed and lives wasted without any overriding purpose except to fight back and survive. In the end, for NATO, US and European assistance, the price was the Dayton Accords, defining both the conflict and its resolution in largely ethnic/religious terms. After all, what mediator would admit that he is crafting a peace deal that would legitimize the demands of haters, like let's say ISIS, the Klan or Karadzic/Mladic? (Read: ""Seduction Diplomacy"") It was always my hope, even expectation, that Euro-Atlantic integration would bend the Dayton Accords toward such political values. However, has Europe and the US now been infected by the bug that was still treatable a quarter century earlier? Is this the bug that spreads as legitimate cure to the cries of populist snake-oil purveyors, from Syria, Myanmar, and Africa to Austria and the US? BiH is now more divided but the divisions are even more manifested in the fabric of Europe and the US, or certainly the rhetoric that has reverted from what we knew was the stairway down.

It was 24 years ago today, May 22, 1992, when Bosnia & Herzegovina (BiH) became a member of the United Nations, and I was appointed its first Ambassador. Then was a time of high expectations as well as urgency. The Berlin Wall had just been torn down, but BiH was being engulfed by conflict that appeared to be the last gasps of an authoritarian system suddenly transforming itself from communist to nationalist-fascist. However, few thought that after the collapse of the Soviet Union that new walls would become the currency of political exploiters, whether Austria, Myanmar, Syria, or U.S. (Read: ""Putin Drops the Bombs & Deals the Cards in Syria & Ukraine"") BiH's admission to the UN was the reborn state's first diplomatic success in an effort to confront a war of aggression from outside and a divisive-fascist assault from within upon a centuries-old tradition of diversity and co-existence. As Sarajevo, BiH's capital and its institutions, were besieged and already in the early stages of an effort to strangle and ethnically cleanse all of its Bosniak (Muslim), Bosnian Croat (Catholic) and all others who would oppose the war and killing for homogenization, I became the voice and face of a country in which I was born, even if I was most American in my personal and political culture -- one might say that I was the coincidental Ambassador designated by necessity. As one trained in law and having succeeded as an investment banker, the challenge did not appear beyond reach. Most importantly, the US with its multi-ethnic values just enshrined in the face of obstinate segregationists appeared an ideal political and economic model to suppress those waging violence against ""the other"" as well as diversity. The new Europe, with millions now freed from the yoke of Soviet domination and facing the challenge of integrating newer potential members and older generations of immigrants, needed more bridges even as the walls collapsed. The struggle of Bosnia was not an isolated conflict between rival religions or ethnic groups but a defining battle between the new vision versus the old fears and their mongers. Stereotypes & Cliches as Weapons of Wall Builders:  However, from the outset BiH's and my greatest enemy were stereotypes, and the effort to exploit such by those who did not have the vision and/or will to confront hate mongers. Having failed to dissuade Slobodan Milosevic, (then Serbia's strongman), and his agents, the language of ethnic divides was adopted by mediators and much of international diplomacy. The conflict started to be described in the cliches of ""age-old hatreds"" and ""millennium-old wars"" as if the mediators were tackling flawed genetics and history. Of course, many of these same mediators and diplomats had come from a European continent that had seemingly overcome its own ugly cliches and narratives to erase suspicions and wars in favor of a new European vision.

Nations such as South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and others all keep a close eye on China, but they also know that they individually and especially collectively possess enough economic and political vitality to offset some of China's regional dominance. At a conference in Brisbane, Australia May 18-20, ""Soft Power and Public Diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific,"" government officials and academics from an array of Pacific countries discussed ways that they might best use soft power -- attraction rather than coercion -- to advance their strategic interests. The roundtable conversations underscored the importance of relying on innovative public diplomacy to reach soft power goals. In this region, as elsewhere in the world, internet-based media are connecting growing numbers of people, and this connectivity empowers them to an unprecedented degree. They expect to be involved in the policymaking that affects their lives. Governments, in turn, increasingly understand that they can no longer conduct diplomacy in ways that are detached from public scrutiny and participation.That is the essence of the change in global politics that enables the rise of public diplomacy. The theory is not complicated, but putting public diplomacy to work requires imagination and persistence.Among the ideas discussed at the conference was ""collaborative public diplomacy,"" which would involve a number of states working in concert to reach regional publics. This would be especially important in dealing with issues such as climate change. The futures of most Pacific countries are linked in one way or another to the ocean itself and the industries, such as fishing, derived from it. After centuries of taking the ocean and its resources for granted, the region's nations have recognized, to varying degrees, the fragility of this asset. Collaborative efforts will be essential in enlisting the region-wide political support needed to respond to climate change through revised priorities and policies.North Korea's militarism is another Pacific issue for which public diplomacy is important, particularly in efforts to forestall a nuclear arms race in the region. Soft power is most effective when it has a hard edge. The United States hopes diplomacy can control North Korea, but neighbors such as South Korea and Japan will trust diplomacy only if they believe that the United States will protect them. A question that arose at the conference was this: If North Korea develops nuclear missiles that could not reach Hawaii or California, but could devastate Seoul or Tokyo, would the United States use its hard power and intervene militarily? Unless citizens within striking distance of North Korea believe that the answer to this is ""Yes,"" U.S. soft power overtures will not dissuade those countries from developing their own nuclear weapons, an outcome no one wants. As for the chess match with China, President Barack Obama's visit to Vietnam illustrates how part of that game is being played. By reaching out to the Vietnamese public, the United States can enhance its own stature in the region and constructively reinforce the historic animosity between Vietnam and China. The United States rightly sees strategic value in using public diplomacy to give China things to worry about close to home.In all these matters, soft power is preferable to the hard power of military force or economic sanctions. Although the North Korea conundrum may, unfortunately, require hard power, relying on soft power is the most logical approach to dealing with China and overcoming intraregional rivalries that affect many issues. In the Pacific, as elsewhere, the combination of globalization and new media connectivity make the use of public diplomacy and soft power not just desirable, but essential. The region's political leaders need to recognize that."

Many people will warn you that in an ever more competitive economy the clock is ticking.”“Well, many people are wrong,” he quipped. “You’ve got time.”Rocca went on to describe the circuitous route he took to becoming a successful screen presence and writer with some funny anecdotal gems.After graduating college, Rocca studied Kabuki in Japan, did odd jobs in his hometown outside Washington, D.C., and scored the role of Doody in the Southeast Asia tour of a production of the musical “Grease,” he recalled.Rocca subsequently got his start in television as a writer for the PBS series “Wishbone,” about a dog that imagines himself taking part in famous literary dramas.The Emmy Award-winning show has something of a nostalgic cult following among millennials who watched it as pre-teens in the 1990s. And Rocca’s revelation of his little-known work on “Wishbone” almost makes the speech newsworthy in itself.But that wasn’t his big break. Living in characterless Dallas suburbs during production of “Wishbone” prompted even more soul-searching and sent him on a tour of late 19th and early 20th century presidential residences in the midwest, according to Rocca.The self-assigned road trip fired Rocca up about American history.A colorful turn at the Indianapolis residence of our illustrious 29th president, Benjamin Harrison, was apparently especially memorable.Rocca then parlayed his “passion for the material” into the gig as a correspondent for “The Daily Show” that launched him to national fame.“There was no grand five-year plan,” Rocca said of his accidental stardom. “Because five-year plans usually don’t work. You know who liked five-year plans? Josef Stalin. Not a great role model.”Rocca has not forsaken his love of American history for the entertainment world, of course. He applied his comic talents to the subject matter in the 2004 book, All the Presidents’ Pets: The Story of One Reporter Who Refused to Roll Over.You might have seen Rocca lately on CBS’ “Sunday Morning,” where he is a correspondent, or on his Cooking Channel show, “My Grandmother’s Ravioli.”The openly gay reporter delivered the first Bible reading at Pope Francis’ mass in Madison Square Garden in New York City in September, in an act activists applauded because of the Catholic Church’s opposition to homosexuality.Rocca concluded his remarks at Sarah Lawrence with a series of smart and amusing advice for various challenging scenarios that recent college grads -- and really all people -- are likely to encounter.“If someone asks you, ‘What are you working on these days?’ It’s OK to say ‘My personal life,’” he said. “Because it does require work.”"
