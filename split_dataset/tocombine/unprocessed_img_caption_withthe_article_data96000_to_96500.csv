0,RELIGION,Don't Let Marriage Be a Four-Letter-Word,"Rev. Amy Ziettlow, ContributorGenX Pastor and Host of Conversation with Amy Ziettlow",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-let-marriage-be-a-four-letter-word_b_6739326.html,"As an ordained minister of a small Lutheran congregation, I am uniquely committed to the social and religious institution of marriage and the role it plays in raising children and in providing life-long companionship.",2015-02-24,"Wedding rings with marriage vows, a bridal bouquet and tulle",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fb8f220000ba01dd3577.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am a member of the recently formed Marriage Opportunity council. The founding Marriage Opportunity statement, penned by David Blankenhorn, William Galston, Jonathan Rauch, and Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and signed by over a hundred public intellectuals, makes a case for expanding access to the rite of marriage for all those who seek it. I signed as a Lutheran clergy member who officiates at weddings and who cares deeply about the couples and families in the local congregation I serve who are or who would desire to be married. The opening thesis of the document states its aim well: Make marriage achievable for all who seek it. These words are key. First, not everyone will seek to be married, but for those who desire marriage, significant barriers stand in their way. For same-sex couples, the legal and societal barriers are well known and the shift to inclusion slow, but well documented. But other barriers exist, ones that show up in the statistics about the decline in marriage that can be traced to socio-economic class and education levels. The college-educated continue to marry and stay marry in relatively stable numbers, but for working class Americans, many of whom may cohabitate and/or have children together, marriage is viewed as an ideal but a liability. Instead of a safety net for the individuals and children involved, marriage has become a risk; a partnership that may create more financial upheaval than stability and that often ends in the heartbreak of divorce. The Marriage Opportunity statement seeks to unite all those, gay and straight, rich, poor and in-between, who believe marriage is a good that should be accessible to all people and who acknowledge that progressive work needs to be done to make that dream a reality.As an ordained minister of a small Lutheran congregation, I am uniquely committed to the social and religious institution of marriage and the role it plays in raising children and in providing life-long companionship. I play a unique role in shepherding engaged couples to their wedding day and in the rituals that transition two singles into a new family. As a preacher and pastor, I talk about and to families about healthy relationships, economic and otherwise, every week. However, in the last ten years, ecclesial conversations about marriage have been dominated by determining what the couple can look like who comes to the church sanctuary to get married. Can two men be the couple? Two women? Can our doors be open to all couples that seek the covenant of marriage? Much study, biblical and otherwise, prayer, conversation, and argument has led to major shifts in our inclusivity causing both great joy and schism. I am a clergyperson who has spent a great deal of time on this justice issue. I have grieved the departure of many colleagues and congregations from our denomination because of it, but it has been an important conversation to have not only for our brothers and sisters in Christ who have long felt that their identity and relationships have been negated, whether benignly ignored or actively persecuted, but for the church as a whole to clarify the importance of marriage for all individuals and families. It was time.Because of the contentious tenor of these conversations about marriage, few clergy members or congregations want to talk about marriage anymore. The word ""marriage"" has become a four-letter word. One we rarely want to talk about in colleague gatherings let alone on Sunday mornings. This is a shame. My pastoral mentor, Don Browning, often stressed that the church is the custodian of the marriage tradition and thus should be a leader in supporting the institution over the life span of those we serve. I read the Marriage Opportunity statement as a call to action to fellow clergy, stressing that this statement is merely a start of a fresh conversation that broadens our identification of those who are seeking to be married to include the economically disadvantaged. Faith communities may be one of the few places devoted to supporting marriage relationships and the economic needs of the members and the surrounding communities. Through word, sacraments, and service, the church proclaims an inclusive message that all individuals deserve opportunities for meaningful vocation, stewardship, healthy marriages and family stability. As one of the few intergenerational gathering places in society, the church offers a place where older couples can role model stable marriage and to those just starting out. The church can play a critical role in helping those who get married grow in maturity personally but also serve as a community hub in creating educational and economic opportunities to increase the number of marriageable people. Churches can support both the value of marriage and the economic means that make getting married possible. We should remove obstacles, discriminatory and economic, that deter or prevent people who want to get married from being able to do so, and create practices and policies that help all people who want to be married, stay married. The opportunity is now to begin the conversation. Don't let marriage be a four-letter-word in your congregation!Amy Ziettlow is an affiliate scholar with the Institute for American Values, the sponsoring organization for The Marriage Opportunity statement. She played no direct role in writing the document. "

The awardees who took that route produced some great lines. In accepting the award for Best Adapted Screenplay, for example, The Imitation Game's Graham Moore urged emerging gay youth to ""stay weird, stay different."" In accepting with Ellen Goosenberg the award for Best Documentary Short, Crisis Hotline's Dana Perry declared that ""we should talk about suicide out loud."" If you understand Spanish, you'll have caught a member of the screenplay team for Birdman thanking all of Argentina. Someone on that same team thanked a dog too, which raised them in my estimation. What another speech lacked in eloquence, it made up for with humanity. In accepting the award for Best Supporting Actor, Whiplash's J.K. Simmons enjoined us to call our parents. We're not to text or email them. We're to use our phones. (Sprint helpfully offered to cut our Verizon bills in half during the show.) Simmons seemed to realize after all this that he hadn't yet thanked his own parents. Rather than calling, he went ahead and did it right there on the stage in front of America. Do as I say, not as I do. Another noteworthy speech came when Selma's John Stephens and Lonnie Lynn accepted the award for Best Original Song. Perhaps there wasn't time for this, but Lynn (whose stage name is Common) made a beautiful analogy between the change our country needs and the Edmund Pettus Bridge where Martin Luther King Jr. marched. Contrast Lynn's comments with another speech that broke acceptance speech grammar. In accepting the award for Best Live Action Short, The Phone Call's Matt Kirkby and James Lucas tossed in Britishisms like ""crikey"" and ""buggers."" But they rambled, trying too hard to seem nonchalant, and their speech was dull. I think most were.Why are so many acceptance speeches so dull? As a linguist, I suspect it's the grammar -- the rules dictating their composition. That awardees are supposed to get to the stage and speechify in under a minute means that this grammar doesn't have many moving parts. The vocabulary isn't much to speak of either. Thank everyone you can think of. Never mind using notes you've prepared ahead of time or memorizing your list. (In the case of the acting professionals, this seems astoundingly short-sighted. But it's part of their speech act.) Stumble about instead, charmingly if you can manage it. Start with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, hit a few colleagues and supporters related to the film itself, and then move to your own family. If you're a fast talker, are willing to jettison some individual thanks or brave enough to quarrel with the orchestra, comment on a social issue (ideally related to the film in some way).In addition to the brave ones in the 2015 cohort who referred to social issues, I'd like to mention Reese Witherspoon's 2006 acceptance of the Best Actress award for her work in Walk the Line. The speech was long and breathy, and it followed the grammar. But at the end, Witherspoon used a June Carter quote to great effect. Apparently, Carter responded to questions about how she was doing with ""I'm just trying to matter."" Witherspoon applied that line to herself and wrapped up very graciously. Rhetorically, this speech moved around, and that made it interesting.But short might be safer. Among my own favorite examples of extreme brevity is Alfred Hitchcock's 1968 acceptance of the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He leans in to the mic after a very slow approach to it and intones ""Thank you."" Then, foiling both his escort and the orchestra, he leans in to the mic again, adding ""Very much indeed."" Alas, most awardees follow the grammar. Still, I'd rather watch the Oscars than the Super Bowl. For me, the latter is hours of boredom interspersed with a few commercial highlights. The Oscars, on the other hand, is hours of entertainment interspersed with a few dull acceptance speeches."
2,POLITICS,The Awesome Life of an American Congressman,"Michael Winship, ContributorSenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, D...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-awesome-life-of-an-am_b_6740328.html,"Like one of the characters from ""Downton Abbey,"" Aaron Schock has made quite a climb, from public servant downstairs to pampered upstairs aristocrat.",2015-02-24,"UNITED STATES - FEBRUARY 02: Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., is interviewed by Roll Call in his Longworth office. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6917452600001123b62edc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We could go on about the inherent contradiction of ""Downton Abbey"" as the biggest hit on public television -- that a series about a fading, genteel (and Gentile) British aristocracy and its servants dominates the schedule of a broadcasting service mandated to promote diversity and give a voice to the underrepresented. And sometime soon, we will talk about precisely that and more.And we could go on at length about the Downton fantasy vs. reality ratio, the series ""polishing up history to make the class divide less savage,"" as British journalist Polly Toynbee pointed out when the show's current season began. ""What we never see,"" she wrote in The Guardian, ""is bedraggled drudges rising in freezing shared attics at 5:30 am; slopping out chamber pots, heaving coal, black-leading grates, hauling cans of hot water with hands already made raw by chilblains and caustic soda. We never dwell on the hardship of scrubbing floors, or scrubbing clothes, or scouring grease; in pre-detergent days, they were up to their elbows all day long.""But for now, let's talk instead about Congressman Aaron Schock, Republican from Illinois. You've heard about how his interior decorator pal, proprietor of a company called Euro Trash, redecorated Schock's new Capitol Hill office in high ""Downton Abbey"" style -- which is more than somewhat ironic because, as Josh Israel at ThinkProgress pointed out, ""Schock has repeatedly voted against federal funding for public broadcasting, voting to defund National Public Radio and for a Paul Ryan budget that zeroed out all funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."" But even more important, Schock's expensive tastes and how he spends money to make money for his party tells a sad story of the state of Congress and campaign fundraising.It has been three weeks or so since Washington Post reporter Ben Terris stumbled onto Schock's mini-manor: ""Bright red walls. A gold-colored wall sconce with black candles. A Federal-style bull's-eye mirror with an eagle perched on top."" And that was merely the reception area. Schock's inner sanctum was: ""...another dramatic red room. This one with a drippy crystal chandelier, a table propped up by two eagles, a bust of Abraham Lincoln and massive arrangements of pheasant feathers.""Schock's communications director, Benjamin Cole, just about collapsed from the vapors when he found out a reporter had slipped past the velvet ropes (""You've got a member [of Congress] willing to talk to you about other things,"" he complained. ""Why sour it by rushing to write some gossipy piece?"") Within days, Cole was gone, due not to the Downton dustup but for making stupid racist comments on Facebook that he apparently thought were amusing. As Violet Crawley, the dowager countess, would say, ""Vulgarity is no substitute for wit."" (Yes, we confess, ""Downton Abbey"" is a guilty pleasure for us, too...)In truth, Schock's office looks more like a cut-rate version of the infamous Red Room in ""50 Shades of Grey"" than the height of inherited, entitled elegance. House members pay for such renovations and furniture from a taxpayer-funded account that also covers staff and official travel. For example, according to USA Today, after Rep. Schock was first elected, during a period from December 2009 into the first part of 2010, the congressman spent nearly $120,000 on furniture and renovations, including hardwood floors, ""high-end countertops"" and painting.The Euro Trash decorator friend said she had offered her current professional services for free, although the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) notes that in 2012, Rep. Schock's campaign paid $5,522 to her company for ""office equipment."" Within a day or so of the Post story, Rep. Schock announced he would be paying her for her work as well as the various new furnishings, which presumably include the pheasant feathers. House rules prevent taking for free anything worth $50 or more -- ""gifts of services, training, transportation, lodging, and meals, whether provided in kind, by purchase of a ticket, payment in advance, or reimbursement after the expense has been incurred.""This isn't the first time Congressman Schock's financial dealings have come under scrutiny. The congressional newspaper Roll Call notes, ""The House Ethics Committee still has a referral"" from March 2012, stemming ""from an Office of Congressional Ethics investigation that found he may have improperly solicited contributions for an anti-incumbent super PAC."" And recently, the progressive website Blue Nation Review reported, ""The month before the 2012 elections, Congressman Schock sold his house to a major Republican donor who was also one of his campaign supporters for a price that appears to far exceed the market value at the time."" The donor was a vice president at the construction equipment company Caterpillar Inc., which in last year's midterm elections was Schock's second biggest campaign contributor.Come to think of it, Schock's new office decor puts us more in mind of a bordello, if it was decorated by Pee Wee Herman. Which might be the more apt metaphor for Congress these days. Although the transfer of cash isn't supposed to take place on the premises, members are doing very well with their outcall services, whether they're Republicans or Democrats. As Ken Silverstein recently wrote at The Intercept, we now have ""a political consensus that churns out business-friendly policies no matter which party is in power...""""One of the reasons that government works well for the wealthy is that so many elected officials are wealthy themselves, and directly benefit from the economic measures they pass. The median net worth of the current Congress is slightly north of $1 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics [CRP], and that surely understates their wealth because it's based on financial disclosure forms that don't require the listing of real estate holdings.""CRP estimates Schock's net worth, as of 2013, at $1,398,695, right at that median sweet spot. Promoting his image as one of the younger members of Congress (he's now 33), Rep. Schock likes to feature pictures of himself surfing, snowboarding and hang gliding at various beautiful locations (he often hires a personal photographer). But this isn't just about publicity for his admirably toned physique. Schock is all about raising money for his party and fellow Republican members -- and to pull in that kind of cash perceived wisdom says you have to spend a bundle to attract it. That translates into lots of trips, expensive meals, private jets and time in lavish hotels and resorts. It's a burden but someone has to do it.Politico reports, ""In Aspen, Colorado, [Schock] stays at the Little Nell, a five-star resort near the ski slopes. In Las Vegas, he prefers the pricey Wynn hotel. While in Vail, Colorado, and San Francisco, it's the Four Seasons. In Miami Beach, he's sampled the Delano, Fontainebleau and the exclusive Soho Beach House. And in Beverly Hills, California, he's tried both the Peninsula and the Beverly Wilshire.""It's also about providing playtime for deep-pocketed contributors. Again, according to Politico, ""... Schock is constantly fundraising, and he has repeatedly attended high-profile events. On Jan. 31, 2014, Schock cut a check to the NFL for more than $10,000 to cover the cost of Super Bowl tickets. In April 2013, Schock spent $3,320 on tickets to the CMA Country Music Awards. Instead of holding fundraisers at golf courses -- as dozens of other Republicans do -- Schock insiders say he prefers sporting and music events."" And you wonder why so little attention is paid to the poor and middle class?Like one of the characters from ""Downton Abbey,"" Aaron Schock has made quite a climb, from public servant downstairs to pampered upstairs aristocrat. Meanwhile, when he's not jetting to and fro, raising and spending cash, perhaps Congressman Aaron Schock can dream up new ways of raking in money -- and spending it -- as he sits in his ornate new office. What next? With the pope speaking before Congress in September, how about selling indulgences to corporate fat cats and turning the congressman's workspace into a modest replica of the Sistine Chapel? That might be just the thing."
3,PARENTS,Adopting Us,"Thomasina Guidry, ContributorWriter and blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adopting-us_b_6740528.html,"My husband wants to adopt my daughter.

And I want my daughter to be adopted by him.This journey, which we've discussed since before we married more than two years ago, is now coming to fruition. We've contacted our attorney, put down the retainer and scheduled our appointment. We are excited and overjoyed with what's about to come. We are moving beyond blending our family; we are melting it. She will be sharing his last name and he will legally be her other parent. This is HUGE for us. Yet, on the other hand, we know that there is a chance that this could not end up the way we hope. We aren't naïve; there are factors that could come into play and change our plans entirely. It's happened before and it could happen again. And that frightens the hell out of us. Initially, my husband was going to adopt two of my daughters. We were scheduled to start proceedings in March, on our one-year anniversary. The girls, aware of our plans, were beyond thrilled at the prospect of becoming his. Especially my 12-year-old, who yearned for a positive male figure to fill that blank space. Four months before the appointment, her biological father showed up out of nowhere -- after 10 years of being MIA. Several court hearings and four broken hearts later, her adoption was taken off the table. Which is why we want to control this process by micromanaging every step. But obviously, that is not how this works. Coming from two people who begin their day planning each and every detail of it, this is completely out of our comfort zone. We are, again, expecting to move forward and not be blindsided by the unexpected. In addition to that, allowing people we have never met to qualify us as a family. The vulnerability we are experiencing and will continue to over the next six months (if we're lucky) leaves us nauseated, to say the least. To be clear, our family life is nothing to be anxious over. We have a stable home and careers. The kids are more than happy and want for nothing. Both of our families are supportive in every way possible. We are, for lack of a better phrase, living the dream. With that being said, we can't help but feel as if we've willingly entered an unchartered territory -- like we've been blindfolded and led into the woods by complete strangers. The insecurities have become amplified, causing us to question our motives. Why are we wanting to proceed with the step-parent adoption? Is it that important for a piece of paper to state that my husband is her father? Does her having his last name make her any more his child? Are we being selfish in this decision? Will we survive if this one doesn't go through?OK, we know we'll make it if for some reason this adoption is denied. Most importantly, we also know that regardless of the outcome, we are staying on this path because our intentions are pure. There is not an ounce of malice or pride driving either one of us. The only motivation we have is simple and common -- love. My husband is enamored with his new role as a parent and what better way to profess that than by making this commitment? We can be secure in the knowledge that receiving a notarized piece of paper will only be just that --a piece of paper. The man who raises my children, who would do and does anything and everything for them, is now and will always be the one they call dad. The stones we have to uncover, the hills and valleys we come across are anyone's guess at this point. There are no guarantees on where this will lead or where we'll end up, but we are certain of two things: Wherever that is, it won't be the end of the road and we'll still be together as a family. Our family."

And that's just the non-living stuff. Then there are all the human and animal sounds. Beneath all that are the natural sounds of nature -- the crashing of the surf on the shore, the rustling of leaves in the trees, the crescendo of raindrops on the sidewalk -- it can get loud out there.For most of us, between the 60,000-80,000 thoughts we receive each day, and the millions of vibrations that flow into our ear canal from our environment, there isn't a lot of silence. Our minds can be consumed by the noise around us, which only revs up the perceived noise within -- but the reality is that we control the volume button of life. We control the speed at which life flows at us. When we connect to our most genuine self -- the part of us that rests beneath our clothes, beneath our flesh casing, beneath our physical structure -- deeper still -- beneath our emotions, beneath our ego, at a more subtle level than even our intellect, then we awaken a wonderful stillness and a magnificent silence, a state of consciousness that some refer to as bliss.In this state, we experience Namaste -- no judgment, no fear, no regrets, no grievances, no expectations, vulnerability, gratitude, forgiveness, compassion and truth.How do we get there? How do we connect to the silence? We can start by placing our hand on our heart, closing our eyes, and gently following our breathing in and out -- feeling the universe flow into you with each inhale and out of you with each exhale.Try it now. As you read these words, feel the air flow in and out of you. Feel your lungs stretch and relax. Feel your chest rise and fall. Now close your mouth, and gently breathe in for four seconds and out for four seconds, solely through your nose. Feel your belly fill as you inhale. Feel it release as you exhale. Again, don't consciously do anything to alter your breath other than closing your mouth and breathing both in and out through your nose. Just observe your breath for about a minute... simply be aware that you breathe in to a count of four, and exhale to a count of four. As you breathe, silently notice ""I'm breathing in, I'm holding the breath, I'm breathing out, I'm holding the breath."" Maintain this awareness for the next few minutes. And each of us has the ability to do this in any moment; upon waking, while showering, while walking your dog, while getting into your car, while waiting on line, while sitting at your desk or in a meeting, while reading this sentence. It only takes 16 seconds!Watch for the release of davidji's new book ""Destressifying: The Real-World Guide to Personal Empowerment, Lasting Fulfillment, and Peace of Mind"" in July."
5,MEDIA,What's Next for Jon Stewart?,"Ben Hellwarth, ContributorAuthor and Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/post_9060_b_6709130.html,"I have a feeling that Jon Stewart, with his ersatz Ph.D. from Comedy Central (and no student debt), might like to get on the field of real news and journalism, at least the televised kind, and do something to solve those problems, both the country's and the conflictinator's.",2015-02-23,"This undated image released by Comedy Central shows Jon Stewart on the set of ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" in New York. The Comedy Central show is decamping for both the Republican and Democrat conventions to broadcast a week of shows at each that will parody the nation's most extravagant political pageants. (AP Photo/Comedy Central, Martin Crook)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c5462200005700dc8821.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Jon Stewart's relatively low-key announcement that he will be leaving The Daily Show, he didn't say much about his plans: ""I don't have any specific plans -- got a lot of ideas; I got a lot of things in my head."" As he said this at the end of his Feb. 10 show on Comedy Central, he raised his hands to ear level, whirling them in a frenetic egg-beater gesture to make the point, and pretty much left it at that.There's already been some inevitable speculation about possible Stewart successors, but the bigger question may be what Stewart himself will do next. His most likely post-Daily Show career paths would seem to be the ones leading either into filmmaking, politics or journalism. Working in fast food is apparently not an option, judging from Jon's unequivocal on-air rejection the other night of an offer from Arby's.So let's first consider filmmaking. Jon Stewart has done some acting and has numerous producer credits. Most recently, testing deeper Hollywood waters, he wrote and directed Rosewater, a more seriously themed movie than we might have expected from a comedian -- not that we haven't seen Stewart get serious before, perhaps most famously on CNN when he fired away at his Crossfire hosts.Rosewater got reasonably warm reviews, and if any first-time filmmaker had a shot at box-office glory, or at least breaking even, it would seem to be the one with the enviable powers of publicity that come with his Daily Show perch and his many friends in high-profile places. This certainly didn't hurt the sales of the humorous books he's co-authored, but Rosewater has struggled at the box office (I've been meaning to see it, Jon, and I will!), which has got to be sobering for someone who presumably plans to continue paying New York City rents and send his kids to college. The life of the filmmaker might feel just a little too flaky as a second act, especially for someone accustomed to a regular and rather hefty paycheck.Which brings us to politics. In this arena, Jon Stewart surely has potential. His earnest summation at the end of the ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear"" in the fall of 2010 sounded almost like a stump speech, and looked like one, too, as Stewart strode about the stage, his tie fluttering along with American flags in the breeze, the U.S. Capitol gleaming in the background.If Mr. Stewart were to go to Washington, he would certainly arrive less naïve and better connected than the character played by that other Mr. Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and the notion that actors or entertainers can enter politics is not as confounding as it once was, thanks largely to Ronald Reagan. Indeed the joke in the first Back to the Future movie --  disbelief being expressed that Reagan, known only as an actor in the 1950s, would be president in 1985 -- by now packs less of a punch line. Since the Reagan era we've seen a number of detours from Tinsel Town into the Beltway.For Stewart the example closest to home has got to be Al Franken, the SNL alumnus and comedian turned U.S. Senator from Minnesota. I could see Stewart replicating Franken's successful run either in New Jersey, where Stewart grew up, or in New York, where he was born and has lived -- and would thus be less likely to be called a carpetbagger than two other notable New York senatorial candidates, Robert Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, who were both elected despite having debatable New York cred.But here's the problem with becoming a political figure: It would mean relinquishing a sizable chunk of privacy. As a celebrity Jon Stewart already knows something about what it's like to have less of a private life than the average, untelevised American. I have not gotten the vibe that he would be happy to have himself, his family or his friends subjected to the added exposure and scrutiny that would come if he were to seek elective office, much less win and become a full-fledged public official. That's my hunch, anyway, and if we rule out filmmaking and we rule out politics, that leaves Jon with journalism.The near-simultaneous suspension of NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams with Stewart's announcement has prompted not-entirely-facetious suggestions that the two anchors simply switch jobs. That probably won't work out, but Stewart has often expressed a genuine admiration for what journalism, properly practiced, can do. At the same time, he has steadfastly maintained that, unlike real journalists or news anchors, he is not ""on the playing field;"" he is merely ""in the stands yelling things, criticizing,"" as he told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in a lengthy 2010 interview.But now that he's leaving the stands, I could see Stewart getting onto the field. It won't necessarily be easy, as real journalists know, and Stewart will have to shed the cloak of comedy in which he has often wrapped himself to make clear that he is not a journalist -- and thus not subject to the same rules and standards.Yet Stewart has in many respects been on the field of real journalism already, as Maddow suggested. He hasn't just been yelling from the stands; he's been thoughtfully interviewing his guests, from pundits to presidents, in ways that often sound a lot like real journalism, at least as practiced on TV.So his 17 years in an anchor chair -- even if it's been a chair metaphorically lined with whoopee cushions -- has been good training, like a prolonged graduate school program, with the thrust of Stewart's thesis being pretty much what he said during the ""Rally to Restore Sanity"": ""The country's 24-hour, politico-pundit-perpetual-panic conflictinator did not cause our problems, but its existence makes solving them that much harder.""I have a feeling that Jon Stewart, with his ersatz Ph.D. from Comedy Central (and no student debt), might like to get on the field of real news and journalism, at least the televised kind, and do something to solve those problems, both the country's and the conflictinator's. I think he could do it, and do it well, especially if he brings to the field the elements of context, proportion, fairness, balance, accuracy and grit that he has so often found lacking in the cacophony of modern media, most alarmingly in TV news.By combining those elements with his personal brand of humor, humility, humanity, sanity and civility, Jon Stewart would be uniquely poised to transform himself into the most trusted man in America, a 21st-century Walter Cronkite on a mission to re-program or even dismantle the conflictinator. That would be no laughing matter, but I think Jon would still dig the job."

Shirley ChisholmThe first African-American and the first slave to publish a book of poems, Phillis Wheatley's book, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, was published in 1773. Brought to Massachusetts when she was about 8 years old, Wheatley was tutored by the daughter of her owner and published her first poem when she was 12 years old. Later, she wrote several poems honoring General George Washington during the Revolutionary War. Mary Eliza Mahoney was also a pioneering African-American woman. The first black nurse, Mahoney completed her nurse's training in 1879. A strong women's rights advocate, she is also credited with being one of the first women to register to vote after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. Mahoney has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.The first president of the National Association of Colored Women, Mary Church Terrell spent her life advocating for civil rights and women's rights. The daughter of former slaves, Terrell attended Oberlin College and graduated in 1884. Having been taught the value of education by her parents, she proceeded to obtain her master's degree as well. When she joined the suffrage effort, she found that African-American women were often excluded from the conversation. Determined to change that situation, she co-founded and became the first president of the National Association of Colored Women. She later was a charter member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the first African-American woman appointed to a school board. Dorothy Height built on the efforts of Mary Church Terrell and her colleagues in continuing the first for civil rights and women's rights. After being accepted to Barnard College, the institution declined to enroll her and she pursued her education at New York University. Her friendship with Mary McLeod Bethune would influence her for the rest of her life. As president of the National Council of Negro Women, she worked on civil rights with Martin Luther King, Jr., and others and was considered one of the ""Big Six"" in the Civil Rights Movement - and the only woman. Included in Height's many honors are the President Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal and induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame.Another groundbreaker was Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to the U.S. Congress (1968). She served in the U.S. House of Representatives (representing New York) for seven terms. One of the founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Chisholm was a huge advocate for women, children, and minorities. Running for U.S. President in 1972, she became the first African American to run for that office from either major party. Her autobiography is titled Unbought and Unbossed.

That is a question that I am constantly asked and it use to annoy me. Somewhere along the way I embraced the fact that I am unique. It is not every day that someone meets a black Jewish woman who also happens to be a witch. Now it's rather entertaining for me to watch people process their thoughts and questions about my different identities.While you may not meet a Jewish black chick every day, you just might meet a Wiccan/witch. We are not as uncommon as some people think. Did you know that Wicca may be is one of the largest growing religions in the United States? You bet your broomstick that it is. Every day more people are adding a touch of Wicca to their lifestyle. However most people are doing the Wicca thing on the down low, because people make all kinds of assumptions about magick and witches. So, what exactly is Wicca or being a witch anyway?The Wiccan religion is a form of modern paganism that was started in England in the 20th century by a guy named Gerald Gardner who looked like a cross between Einstein and Colonel Sanders. People who practice lovingly call it witchcraft or ""the craft."" While Wicca is considered a religion just like Christianity, Judaism, or Catholicism, it should also be viewed as a way of life. Don't be surprised to find witches from many religious backgrounds. Witches like me are not uncommon. Wicca does not interfere with most religious dogmas so someone can keep their favored religious practice and throw in a dash of Wicca. As a side note, not all Wiccans are witches or pagan and not all witches are Wiccan. There is a myth that Wiccans/witches participate in the ""dark arts"" which could not be further from the truth. We do not perform black magick or hang out with Satan. In fact Wicca is all about peace and harmony while promoting being one with the divine. Nature is a big component in the religion and incorporating the four elements: earth, air, fire, and air. Most Wiccans adhere to what is known as the Wiccan Rede, a core rule of the religion which states: ""An it harm none, do what you will"". Long story short, what you send out comes back to you threefold, so only sent out the good stuff.Wicca and witches get a bum wrap thanks to television and movies. The big and small screen tends to show us as evil with the exception of shows like Bewitched, Charmed, and Sabrina The Teenage Witch. The most recent popular show that featured Wicca was American Horror Story: Coven. While I enjoyed getting my witches on Wednesdays, there were things there were incorrect in the show. There was so much witch on witch crime on the show that it frustrated me. Wiccans/witches are more about light than the media gives us credit for.Wiccans/witches are a lot of fun thanks to the new and full moon rituals that we celebrate. Throughout the year there are seasonal festivals known as Sabbats which are sexy Solstices and Equinoxes. We dress up and pull out the musical instruments. Some of us even go out into the desert and dance under the light of the moon. Our big celebration is Samhain, most people know this day as Halloween. That is the day that Wiccans and witches think of as the New Year. It is a fabulous day for us and has nothing to do with tricks, though we do have yummy treats.Wicca was developed by philosophers and artsy-fartsy people so it is a democratic practice that allows people to expression the religion as they see fit. If you are interested in Wicca, look for a gathering near you, though most people practice by themselves. Explore Wicca any way that you like it. You do not have to have to make it about being a witch or switching your religion unless you are inclined. I did not come out of the womb wearing a black hat and holding a cauldron. Through the years my witchy spirit found it's way out. Now I am a very eclectic witch that continues to explore and define what blessed be means to me."

This time, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is the movie at issue. It has been nominated for six Academy Awards and praised as an anti-war movie, but has also been attacked for glorifying combat and misrepresenting the American campaign in Iraq. This controversy is nothing new in film history.War and cinema have been both allies and enemies at times. And illuminating this tangled past can, in fact, help us to understand the backstory of the accusations and defenses that swirl around American Sniper. For generations, provocative questions have been raised about war films.Can a war movie be anti-war in sentiment? Who gets to make combat films, and are veterans the only ones who can speak to the truths about war? Combat films almost always rotate around a small group of men who are on a mission, led usually by one individual whose point of view predominates. What does this individual -- his military role and personality -- tell us about the period in which the film was made? It's easiest to trace the moments of collaboration, with World War II a notable chapter in cinema's support of government appeals for mobilization, in part because of the quality of the film professionals recruited. Frank Capra put aside his features to make the U.S. Department of Defense series Why We Fight, and a young Roberto Rossellini made movies about the Navy, Air Force and the Army for the Italian Fascist government. Anti-war movies rarely had government support, but boast equally eminent authors, from Jean Renoir (La Grande Illusion, 1937) to Stanley Kubrick (Paths of Glory, 1957) and onward. When set during active combat, such films often spark debates about whether the anti-war war film is a contradiction in terms. Before American Sniper, Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979) came under attack: It could not be labeled an anti-war movie, some critics held, because the immersive effects of its presentation of the visual and sound spectacle of war far overwhelmed any anti-war message. In truth, war has been a dynamic, if often contentious, partner for the cinema. Around the world, warfare has given the movie industry a set of experiences, collaborations and audiences eager to be shocked and mesmerized. As the film historian Pierre Sorlin observed, every war produces its own image bank -- World War I conjures up trenches and mountains of shells, and Vietnam jungle warfare and the drone of helicopters -- that subsequent war films draw on, creating an endless loop between reality and fiction. Today, as 100 years ago, war films stage the latest thinking in military strategy, and the technologies that accompany it, dramatizing the difficulties and possibilities they present for military operatives. Aerial warfare, and pilots, featured heavily for more than half a century. Starting in 1911-1912, when embedded Italian operators filmed the world's first aerial bombings (during the Italo-Turkish war for Libya), aviation offered a new aesthetic that forever changed how war was filmed. Aviation pictures habituated viewers to the thrill of having their sight aligned with that of the bomber, while sparing them the vision of the bomb's human casualties. This conceit -- placing the spectator in the position of the targeter, with all implication regarding his or her identification with the film's military protagonist -- has proved among the most durable legacy of the war-cinema coupling. In recent decades, though, as the traditional battlefield has deconstructed, the military viewfinder locks on civilians as well as combatants, raising ethical dilemmas for the soldier and by extension for the viewer. This is the case in Lebanon (Samuel Maoz, 2009), for example, which is filmed mostly from inside a tank. The increasing involvement of American forces in counterinsurgency campaigns in connection with the War on Terror has created new interest in small war tactics, in which sharpshooters and surveillance have a prominent role. Thus did Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 The Battle of Algiers, on Algerian insurgency against French colonial rule, seem relevant enough to merit a screening at the Pentagon in 2003. And thus does a sniper serving in Iraq become the protagonist of what has become the highest-grossing war film in American history. Eastwood is doing nothing new in seeking our identification with Bradley Cooper's Chris Kyle -- by aligning our vision with his, the director is involving us in the moral calculus and emotional burdens that come with the decision to take a life. It is in those scenes, where the film is at its most ambiguous as an anti-war war film, American Sniper most purely channels the long history of warfare and its cinematic representation. With his mechanically enabled vision, which allows an easy passage between sighting and shooting, the figure of the sniper allows us to isolate the unresolved issue that has plagued the war-cinema relationship since its inception: That violence, for many, is something that becomes entertaining when experienced at a remove."

Raise your hands."" Our interrogator was not a Gallup census taker but a historical re-enactor, dressed as a 19th century school marm. In 2001, my 24 sixth grade classmates and I ventured thirty miles outside Chicago to witness a day in the life of the population at a turn of the century settlement. The day's field trip culminated in a tenuously related public opinion poll comparing frontier women's educational prospects and LGBT rights. As a closeted middle schooler, I stared intently at the worn beams of wood comprising the one room schoolhouse's floor and desperately willed the exercise to end. In the intervening fourteen years, the U.S. populace has undergone a drastic reorientation in its beliefs regarding the inherent human dignity of LGBT people and their attendant civil and political rights. Between 2012 and 2015 the number of states allowing same sex marriage has quadrupled from nine to 37, plus the District of Columbia. If you'd told me a year ago that gay marriage would soon come to pass in Alabama, I'd have gently reminded you that this is a state whose citizens would sooner fly Confederate flags than rainbow ones. But, most significantly, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, which will decide whether the Constitution requires that all couples, regardless of gender, be allowed to marry despite prohibitions in their particular states. Should the court rely on the same logic it's used in its previous decisions, their ruling in June of 2015 could mandate recognition of every gay marriage in the U.S. regardless of state lines.In 1996 only 27 percent of Americans thought that same sex marriages should be considered legally valid. Less than 20 years later, that number hovers around 54 percent in the total population, jumping to 78 percent among men and women between the ages of eighteen and 29 (87 percent of whom use Facebook). Much has been made of these quantum leaps in such a short timespan, all of which begs the question of what factors account for this dizzyingly fast statistical inversion in public opinion. The answer may have to do with the unprecedented way that social media has reshaped the way we interact with one another.Specifically, the current sea change has not merely the Internet, but the proliferation of social media networks in the early aughts to thank for its ascendance. The Internet aids in the rapid dissemination of information, but cyberspace alone is a vast chasm of anonymity. Outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have accumulated billions of users -- but they specialize in allowing us to feel intimately connected to one another. We share photos, ""life events,"" links to articles and oftentimes our beliefs on these platforms, creating a digital dialogue that serves as an approximation of face to face communication. But, unlike real life, our social networks tend to be comprised of thousands of individuals from various stages of our lives, most of whose thoughts on the Big Game in their present hometown become the digital detritus of the modern era. But this deluge of content from people we otherwise wouldn't be keeping tabs on yields some unexpected benefits. The imperfect algorithms of one's newsfeed are akin to the digital equivalent of panning for gold: Most of it's muck, but you encounter the occasional gem. To wit, I have a Facebook friend who used to occasionally drive me home from school after our respective soccer and track practices. Many years later she now identifies as a queer person, forgoes gendered pronouns and makes hand-crafted wooden home goods in Oakland. I know these specifics not because either of us made an effort to stay in touch over the years, but because I've gleaned the details from her evolving social media presence. Her posts and photos offer a glimpse into a community I don't necessarily encounter in my day-to-day life -- and I'd argue that experience extends to the rest of her digital acquaintances, however removed from queer artisanal goods circles they may be. Similarly, while you might not feel comfortable broaching the subject of gay marriage with your aunt at the Thanksgiving dinner table, the mediated space of social media allows for you to make your opinions known without instigating a more direct confrontation. In an age where your Tumblr meme generating niece and less-than-web-savvy great aunt must somehow inhabit the same digital ecosystem, cross-pollination will inevitably occur. Great aunt Gertie may not really get the fuss over Katy Perry's dancing Superbowl sharks, but she probably understands the intrinsic (if blatantly manipulative) emotion behind such Upworthy.com click bait as ""This 7th Grader Came Out To His Friends -- What Happened Next Will Make You Weep!"" I don't labor under the illusion that every political opinion shared on Facebook alters the entrenched belief systems of our online acquaintances or directly impacts Supreme Court decisions. And admittedly, as any Youtube comments section on an ""It Gets Better"" video testimonial will tell you, the Internet is rife with vitriol and trolls -- vitritrolls if you will. But, what we do on social media, including something as simple as changing one's profile picture, can have a significant impact on normalizing support for a cause like marriage equality.In March of 2013, the Human Rights Campaign urged Facebook users to change their profile pictures to the red equal sign in advance of Supreme Court proceedings for two legal cases regarding same-sex marriage. The initiative was a success; more than 2.7 million people (120 percent more than usual) changed their profile pictures during the following several days according to data released by Facebook. The change was especially rapid in liberal college towns like Ann Arbor and Austin, but even if you weren't a young college kid filled with solidarity during a tipping point in American history, you're probably friends with one on Facebook.And when a lot of people get behind the same idea at the same time, it makes everyone else pause and ponder: 1) What's all the hubbub about? and 2) Where do I stand? That moment of contemplation is critical. It might not change your mind one way or another, but the conversation is now in play. Making your beliefs demonstrably clear to everyone you know creates a powerful pattern of social proof implying that it's acceptable -- even fashionable to assert yourself in favor of your convictions and ultimately encourages a more accepting environment in our real, offline lives. The Internet is ubiquitous, egalitarian and in its most basic form a source of information and connection. In a previous era, a young gay kid growing up in a state less than friendly to LGBT people would have had far fewer mechanisms for finding and connecting with other people like himself. There's a lower barrier to entry in opening up Tinder on your iPhone and furtively switching ""interested in"" to men than there is in mustering the courage to go solo star at the nearest gay bar, or probe the dubious depths of Craigslist. Given the unsurprising correlation between states with the least acceptance of gays tending to have the highest numbers of men in the closet, a connected culture wherein one can dip a toe in the rainbow waters without leaving the couch is a significant gateway in the journey to living a more authentic, visible life. As the Supreme Court prepares to make a decision that could bring equality from the Redwood forest all the way to the Gulf Stream waters, I am compelled to quote the uncommonly poetic words of justice Margaret Marshall's majority opinion in the landmark case of Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that first allowed lesbians and gays to lawfully wed in the United States. In her ruling she writes:Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. Because it fulfills yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, civil marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision of whether and whom to marry is among life's momentous acts of self-definition.I'd like to believe that the sixth grade census of today has a more progressive take on things than it did back in my day, but I'm glad that the kids who are starting to discern who they're going to be, and be with, in this world can go ahead and make it Facebook official."

The 25-year-old looked stunning in an off-the-shoulder red Saint Laurent gown. But Griffith, 57, didn't look too shabby herself in a très chic all-black ensemble. Besides Griffith, a lot of other esteemed post-50 celebrities, including two of our all-time fashion favorites -- Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep -- looked exceptionally gorgeous, in spite of the Hollywood rainfall.Here are just a few of our favorite post-50 celebs at Sunday night's Oscars. What was your favorite look? Let us know in comments.Julianne Moore  Moore, 54, is undoubtedly the queen of the red carpet and never misses the mark on what's trendy. Moore often opts for bright colors to complement her complexion and trademark red hair, and she certainly doesn't shy away from daring styles, like the metallic, feathery showstopper she wore at this year's Golden Globes. She didn't disappoint Sunday, wearing a strapless sequined Chanel gown and Chopard jewels.Robert Duvall  At 84, Duvall has attended his fair share of awards ceremonies. The Best Actor winner for 1983's ""Tender Mercies"" looked extremely dapper on Sunday night, wearing a classic black tuxedo and black tie. In January, he made history by becoming the oldest supporting actor nominee ever for his performance in ""The Judge.""Meryl Streep  With Queen Meryl, 65, we always know what to expect. Graceful neutral tones, a soft hairstyle, minimal accessories -- and always a figure-flattering silhouette. Streep just knows her body and what works with it and though you might not see her in the season's latest and trendiest outfit, her red carpet looks are always sophisticated. On Sunday night, Streep looked enchanting in a graceful skirt and blazer set.Steve Carell  When it comes to men, a tux is pretty standard, but things like hair and accessories can make all the difference. Carell, 52, has been rocking some impressive scruff lately and somehow it's the perfect accompaniment to his red carpet look.  On Sunday night, the star of ""Foxcatcher"" was praised by actress Emma Watson for wearing #HeForShe cufflinks to the Oscars in support of gender equality. (Incidentally, Carell's lovely wife, Nancy, looked pretty darn good herself.)Oprah Winfrey  Not only is Winfrey an actress, philanthropist and international personality, she also is an expert at dressing right for her body type. Over the weekend, Winfrey, 61, practiced her lines on the Oscar stage wearing a smart, cream-colored skirt and matching sweater. On Sunday night, Winfrey wowed in a custom rose-colored Vera Wang Collection gown.Michael Keaton  In 1988, Keaton, 63, caused a stir with the graphic, fitted suit he wore in Tim Burton's ""Beetlejuice."" And then, of course, there were all the Batsuits he wore in Burton's ""Batman"" films. On Sunday night, though, the ""Birdman"" star toned it down, wearing a suave black Ralph Lauren tuxedo.J.K. Simmons  Simmons, 60, enjoyed a spectacular night, winning a Best Support Actor award for his performance in ""Whiplash."" And he looked good doing it, wearing a black tuxedo and matching hat.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d5292500003200384563.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More countries are aiming to end sexual violence against women, as gender equality continues to become a priority around the world.In a new report, advocacy group Equality Now found that since 2000, five countries -- Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Peru and Uruguay -- have repealed or amended provisions that had allowed rapists to avoid punishment by marrying their victims.The developments are among a variety of other positive resolutions highlighted in the report, which examined progress and setbacks regarding gender equality on the 20-year anniversary of the United Nations' 4th World Conference on Women held in Beijing. A handful of other countries, for example, have criminalized marital rape in the past 15 years, and Colombia, Mexico, Romania and Turkey have passed legislation equalizing the minimum ages for males and females to legally wed.However, the report -- which examined laws involving economic status, violence against women, marital status and personal status (such as citizenship) -- noted that a major milestone tracking gender equality had not been met. In 2000, the U.N. General Assembly set a goal to end all laws that discriminated against women around the world by 2005 -- an objective that ""was far from met,"" according to the report. A decade after the target year, women are still fighting for respect as equals in numerous ways. Dozens of countries spanning the globe still have no law banning violence in the home. It's an issue that has historically been both ignored by governing bodies and underreported by women, according to Liesl Gerntholtz, executive director of the women's rights division at Human Rights Watch. ""Because the violence is so invisible you [need] laws to enroll judges, police and other authorities to look for it and prosecute it,"" she told The Huffington Post last year. ""Violence against women is frighteningly simple and complex. Violence will stop when perpetrators stop.""Women also remain significantly less economically empowered than their male counterparts. On average, women earn between 4 and 36 percent less than what men earn, according to the International Labor Organization's Global Wage Report 2014/15. They also make up a smaller share of the labor force: 72.2 percent of men globally were employed in 2013, while 47.1 percent of women were, according to a report published last year. Still, the world has witnessed significant progress in ending gender-based discrimination worldwide, and -- according to U.N. Women -- more women in positions of influence has made a difference. ""Ensuring women are in parliaments, are on the front line of justice, and are represented in the judiciary and customary justice systems helps women to access their rights,"" the group says.

16,IMPACT,Countering Violent Extremism: The President's Call to Action,"Benjamin Orbach, ContributorI’m a social entrepreneur, international development professio...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/countering-violent-extremism-the-presidents-call-to-action_b_6723912.html,"You could watch the news and conclude that countering this threat from ISIS and al Qaeda is a ""Muslim problem."" That isn't the case however -- this is a threat that impacts the wellness of all of our communities and tests the strength of our founding principles.",2015-02-23,"In this Nov. 1, 2014 photo, a Kurdish fighter peers at an Islamic State group position in Kobani, Syria.

At the close of Wednesday's sessions at the White House, the president made the case for where we should concentrate our efforts, and in a call to action, he offered an honest accounting for the division of labor between government and civil society. Government is the only actor that can physically destroy groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda, provide development assistance in countries that are home to the largest numbers of foreign fighters, and call for progress on national grievances -- from human rights abuses to corruption -- in our bilateral dialogues. Civil society has a crucial role in debunking this ideology of extremism and the narrative that America and the West are at war with Islam.For an American audience grappling with brutal actions of ISIS and al-Qaeda, the call to action for civil society was the most interesting part of the speech for two reasons. First, the president placed an emphasis on the special role that Muslim-American leaders (and Muslim leaders worldwide) have to play with defeating this strand of extremism. While few would deny that Muslim-Americans have faced discrimination since 9/11, nowhere else in the world do Muslims enjoy more rights and opportunities than in the United States. Yet that isn't the prevailing storyline about America and Islam throughout the Muslim World. For example, news of the tragic murder of three Muslim-Americans in North Carolina last week has reached hundreds of millions of Muslims and fits into the extremists' narrative of a war against Islam. Unfortunately, stories about the victims' volunteer work in Durham's homeless shelters go either unreported or unread. Volunteering at a shelter is not the stuff of headlines, but it is that kind of civic action that builds community bonds which transcend differences of race or religion. To combat this form of extremism, we need more of those bonds, but we also need for young Muslims around the world to know that those bonds are a norm of our society. The President also spoke to the unique role that Muslim religious leaders have to play in decrying ISIS' perversion of their religion. More religious leaders come forward every day, but those voices need to be amplified and new voices need to be heard. Current efforts are not enough as extremists have become adept at spreading their message of hate, particularly on the Web. ISIS, for instance, has developed apps that enable their followers to put out 90,000 tweets in a single day. The true spokespeople for Islam are not competing at that level. They need to reach young people in Brussels, Tunis or even Arlington who are watching and listening to what ISIS is putting out there. The messenger and the message are equally important in this case, i.e. a White House video is not going to be effective. Second, the president's call to action is significant because it extends beyond Muslim communities and speaks to all of us. Just like gangs, cyber-bullying, drunk driving and other societal issues that have challenged the health of American communities, countering extremism is something that each of us is going to have to start thinking about in our neighborhoods and schools. While a relatively small number of Americans (compared to Europeans) have traveled overseas to join ISIS, there is no room for complacency. There are no exact recipes for why someone joins an extremist movement, but you could make a good case that preventing radicalization in the U.S. involves forming community-level partnerships that promote inclusion and dignity for all. At the summit, law enforcement officials, civic and religious leaders, and educators from Boston, Los Angeles and Minnesota presented pilot programs from their communities. The techniques they spoke about included developing after-school programs for at-risk youth, building models for community policing, running dialogue groups and creating community-to-school liaison positions. These techniques aren't new, but these communities are applying them with new partners in a respectful and constructive way. Along these lines, President Obama made the case that Muslim-Americans must feel like they ""have a place here in America,"" and that our democracy and civil liberties must be upheld and respected. Only 27 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Muslims, though. If we were talking about Jews or African-Americans, that sentiment would prompt a national dialogue. To combat extremism, this will have to change.At our best, America's diversity is our strength, our source for innovation, and the common condition that has led to our societal notion of equality. All of our groups must feel included and equal, though or our system doesn't work. You could watch the news and conclude that countering this threat from ISIS and al Qaeda is a ""Muslim problem."" That isn't the case however -- this is a threat that impacts the wellness of all of our communities and tests the strength of our founding principles. Combating extremism is part of the new normal. While we can't do the heavy lifting that our government has to carry out on our behalf, there is indeed something that each of us can do."

It's what separates us from lentils."" --Richard Lagravanese, The Fisher KingHe did it the hard way, like David battling Goliath this past Valentine's Day. Yes, Richard Lagravanese's latest effort, The Last Five Years, a romantic musical of sorts with next to no spoken dialogue, opened against the whip-wielding Fifty Shades of Grey, a syrupy softcore melodrama with perhaps too much dialogue. The battle's result so far, at least as of this past Wednesday: $51,475 versus a worldwide take of $311,673,020. Well, at least David got the better reviews.Yes, Richard Lagravanese, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of such acclaimed titles as The Fisher King, Behind the Candelabra, The Bridges of Madison County, and Unbroken, which he co-wrote with the Coen Brothers, and the intermittent director of such fare as Living Out Loud and Freedom Writers, is a survivor of numerous Hollywood battles, many won, some lost. Beloved, for example, didn't fare so well. Neither did Beautiful Creatures, the recent teen-witch love story with a southern twang and numerous Charles Bukowski references.However, with The Last Five Years, Lagravanese was aiming small. He wasn't seeking out the mall crowds but that bijou contingent of folks who can tell the difference between Kelli O'Hara and Patti Lupone. This film adaptation of the cult off-Broadway musical composed by Jason Robert Brown begins with the aftermath of a romance and then jumps back and forth in time to unearth why true love went wrong for the characters portrayed by Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan. The tuner, which has been performed over 1000 times in the United States and around the globe, even caused The New York Times to print an article on why ""people travel the world to see it, or make marriage proposals using the show's lyrics.""Fans of the original show will not be disappointed. Not a note has been cut and the two leads can really belt out. Additionally, Sabine Hoffmann's editing is calm and unfancy unlike say Martin Walsh's for Chicago. No Dramamine is needed. The song is king here.But what attracted Lagravanese to the rather simple boy-meets-girl-becomes-a- success-cheats-and-then-drops-inconsolable-girl material? Was it that the film is Manhattan-based where he lives with his family? Or that the lovers are a Jewish and Catholic mix like he and his wife?Gravanese, couched in the offices of his publicists, PMK, laughs: ""No. That's funny. I just love musical theatre. I was a theatre major, and musical theatre was a part of that. I never saw the original production, but a friend, Todd Graff, who directed a movie called Camp with Anna and A Joyful Noise with Jeremy gave me the score a couple of years after it closed. I kept hearing from musical theatre friends that The Last Five Years had this amazing score. So I would just listen to it over and over, and I became obsessed with the music. It's one of my favorites.""Raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, this son of a taxi driver did admit being able to shoot in Central Park and its environs was an additional incentive: ""That was an extra gift. I do love my city and stories that are based in it. But I have to say it was the score itself. It's how it emotionally made me feel. It got me. You know when you hear music and you get chills and choked up. That's what this score did. I just felt emotionally very connected to it.""""And that's why I made it this way and for this budget,"" Lagravanese continued. ""I've said it a million times before: theatre purists are very similar to Comic Con purists. Our personalities are similar. We're obsessive, we're possessive, and hypercritical, and when we love something, we are very wary of it being adapted to film because people cut songs or they cast people who can't sing. So a big goal of mine was to keep it as pure as possible for the audience I knew would love it. If other audiences get to enjoy it and are open to it, that's wonderful, but I really had a specific audience in mind."" Consequently, one would assume getting investors was rather difficult? ""Not to raise money, no,"" Gravenese smiles and readjusts himself on the sofa. ""But to find a distributor was a little bit of work. But there are millions and millions of musical theater fans. Ever since Glee opened the door, its multiplied and multiplied the musical theater fans across the country and across the world and . . . So because the budget was so low, I knew there was a profit to be made in creating it. Nowadays I'm just exhausted with the pressure of trying to create things to appeal to massive audiences. You know everything has to hit $100 million. It doesn't depend on how much something costs. Shaking his head, he noted with resolve, ""You can make something unique and something fresh and something that hasn't been seen before if you do it for a responsible budget and you hit your audience. You don't have to appeal to everyone. And that's a freedom. The other is a kind of censorship creatively.""Richard Lagravanese with Jeremy JordanCreatively, you can never tell what a Lagravenese project will be like except that the writing will be chockfull of bons mots. In The Fisher King, Jeff Bridges playing a down-and-out shock jock who finds happiness through a homeless man spouts, ""Have you read any Nietzsche? Nietzsche says there are two kinds of people in the world. People who are destined for greatness like Walt Disney and Hitler. And then there's the rest of us. He called us the bungled and the botched."" The Last Five Years is about the bungled and the botched who want to love, try to love, and make a hash of it all not because they are bad people, but because they are human. It's a lovely film by a lovely man who once had Robin Williams woo Amanda Plummer with the line: ""I have a hard-on the size of Florida."""
