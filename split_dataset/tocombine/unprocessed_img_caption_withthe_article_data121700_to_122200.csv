1,WORLDPOST,Syria's Tourism Minister Thinks Business Will Be Booming,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-tourism-homs_n_5268641.html,,2014-05-05,"This photo made on Thursday, May 1, 2014, shows Crac des Chevaliers, the world's best preserved medieval Crusader castle, in Syria. The Crac des Chevaliers, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Homs and just north of the Lebanese border, like many of the country's most significant historical sites, was caught in crossfire during a conflict that activists say has killed more than 150,000 people. Some sites have been turned into military bases. Shelling has smashed historic mosques, churches and markets. Looters have stolen artifacts from excavations and museums.

Speaking during a visit to the historical site, the nation's Minister of Tourism, Bisher Yazigi, boasted that the ancient castle will see ""miscellaneous activities"" planned during the summer. He also expressed hope that the nearby Wadi al-Nasara valley will become a hotspot for visiting expats.The statement is pretty baffling, even for Syria's routinely dubious state-run news agency. Homs has been subject to bombardment and siege since the start of the war and March and April of this year saw a brutal government offensive to crush the opposition's last stand in the rebel-held city. The fighting has left much of the city in shambles, with entire neighborhoods on the front lines destroyed and deserted. Amid increasing reports of starving citizens and fighting, the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution demanding rebels and government troops to allow aid into parts of the city. The Crac des Chevaliers castle has changed hands several times during the war, and most recently rebel forces were forced to evacuate it during the March offensive. The continued clashes have left the World Heritage Site severely damaged.

(AP Photo/Dusan Vranic)To say the least: Homs isn't particularly tourist-friendly, and given the added concern of the country's constant kidnappings, it's hard to believe that the Syrian minister will get his wish of a boon in foreign visitors. It does, however, serve to highlight the atrocious state of what were formally some of the world's greatest historical landmarks. As reports of the destruction of UNESCO World Heritage Sites have become commonplace the war, it's a tragic reminder that in addition to the over 150,000 people killed in the conflict, Syria is also in threat of losing the places that connect the nation to its history."
2,POLITICS,Independence and Nakba: Intertwined and Inseparable,"Avraham Burg, Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israel-independence-day_b_5268536.html,Israel's Independence Day is also Nakba Day.

Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion declared the existence of the State of Israel in Tel Aviv in 1948, ending the British mandate. AFP PHOTO / JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c7371f00003d02256fdb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Israel's Independence Day is also Nakba Day. This is inescapable. The reality of Israeliness can't help but incorporate not only the Jewish story but the Palestinian story as well (Nakba, or ""the catastrophe,"" is the Palestinians' term for what happened to them when the state was founded in 1948.)Space limitations prevent a full consideration here of the complex interrelations between Independence and Nakba. But the pivotal question today is not, ""Who's to blame?"" or ""Who started it?"" or ""Who didn't do enough?"" The pivotal question is a thoroughly practical one: Can the Nakba and Independence coexist in the same space?If the answer of the Jewish-Israeli public is that the two are mutually exclusive, it follows that we should revoke the clauses in Israel's Declaration of Independence that mandate equality for all: ""The State of Israel ... will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants ... will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the holy places of all religions ...""If the answer to the question is that the two cannot coexist, Israel becomes the state of all its Jews, with all that this implies. Jewish, yes, but a lot less democratic; much more ethnic, far less civic.But perhaps, despite everything, a positive answer is possible -- one that allows for a joint, mutually respectful existence, which esteems and accommodates both narratives, the one happy, the other sorrowful, side by side. It's clear that Israel and the Israeli way are in dire need of a completely different path from the one that has been staked out here for nearly seven decades. The Nakba must be absorbed into the Israeli mainstream consciousness.For a considerable time I have thought that the crux of the problem between us and the Palestinians is not politics but psycho-politics. Each side tries to trump the other in the ""trauma competition."" ""Nakba,"" they hurl at us, and we respond with ""Holocaust."" No one -- until the dramatic remarks by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas last week about the crime of the Holocaust -- is truly trying to listen to the feelings, the hurt, the wounds, the fears and the outcry of the other.It's a binary reality: My trauma or nothing. So the result, naturally, is nothing. No deep existential and meaningful peace settlement will ever be undertaken genuinely before an authentic dialogue is fomented between the memories, the traumas and the histories. Not a discourse of rejection and denial, but of sensitivity and accommodation.There are many ways to intertwine past history with the contemporary. Some are symbolic. Thus, the sidewalks in many German cities are studded with ""stumbling blocks"" (Stolpersteine), created and installed by the German artist Gunter Demnig. They are quiet statements, not provocative, that take note, at the entrances to houses, of those who left them never to return. Similarly, sections of the old route of the Berlin Wall have been preserved in the city's streets. In Warsaw, there are small signs in several languages that recall the events that occurred in each place during the Holocaust. Not large, alienated monuments, but a mute presence that forms part of the everyday routine of each passerby.In Israel, a country addicted to history and archaeology, such things are easily done. Nothing bad will befall anyone if history takes in not only the Jews but also the Palestinians of this country. What will be gained is a feeling of partnership with and respect for the place of Israel's Palestinian citizens. Nothing untoward will occur if at every locale we take note of the whole of Israeli history -- one people alongside the other.I don't believe that the wheels of history can be turned back. Yesterday's wrong cannot be amended by creating a new wrong today. But where amends can be made, why not? Ever since Israel's inception, the condition of the Palestinian refugees has been utilized as one of the state's most powerful arguments for its case.""Look at the difference,"" Israeli propagandists have maintained. ""Whereas we took in our millions of refugees from the Arab countries, housed and rehabilitated them for the greater glory of the State of Israel, they -- the Arabs -- never lifted a finger in aid of their refugees. To this day they dwell in wretched camps, eternal clients of UNRWA, incessantly multiplying, downtrodden and neglected.""But that is a hollow argument. Because Jewish Israel did nothing for the Palestinian refugees within the country. It is our obligation to remember that, according to Zionist rhetoric, olim -- Jewish immigrants to Israel -- are, by definition, not refugees. Aliyah -- ""ascent"" to Israel -- is a positive ideological decision, while refugee status is a negative result of expulsion, flight and defeat. In contrast to the Zionist olim, large numbers of the Israeli Palestinians are refugees in every respect.More than a quarter of a million 1948 refugees and their offspring live today within Israel proper. Not in Lebanon and not in the West Bank and not in the Gaza Strip. In Israel. At the end of the War of Independence, about 160,000 Palestinians remained in this country, who had not been driven out by the policy of cleansing. Of these, about 40,000 local DPs were expelled from their homes and compelled to move ""temporarily"" into neighboring towns and villages inside the borders of nascent Israel.For those internally uprooted people, Israel did absolutely nothing. The opposite, in fact. Innumerable court rulings and public and governmental commissions did their best to repeatedly circumvent the simple promises made by the authorities to the inhabitants when they left. What they were promised is that when the fighting ended, they would be able to return to their lands.The best known of these stories, though not necessarily the most crass and shameful, is that of Ikrit and Kafr Bir'im, in Upper Galilee. But all around the country, cemeteries were desecrated, holy places were turned into storerooms and animal pens, entire villages were wiped off the face of their tilled earth, and one person's place of mourning and devastation became another's place of leisure and holiday-making.That process continues, unabated. This is the behavior of an insensitive state and society, which denies the history of some of its citizens -- denies, in fact, part of its own history.It doesn't have to be like this. Israel could make a vast gesture toward itself, its citizens and the entire region by placing the issue of the internal refugees at the top of its order of priorities. As an example of the proper way to implement the right of return; wherever possible and practicable. As this is an internal Israeli matter, it will not alter the demographic balance that is sanctified by the fear-mongering establishments.After room was made here for the whole spectrum of the world's Jewish communities, the time has come to make room for the remaining one-fifth of the country's citizens, too.I have been following with astonishment the bizarre efforts of the leaders of Israel's right wing to draft young Christian Arabs into the Israel Defense Forces. This is yet another ill-advised notion concocted by people who haven't understood modern Israeli nationhood, and, guided by that misunderstanding, are now trying to unravel Arab nationhood. It is a senseless idea. But from the perspective of its advocates -- they should be the first to show signs of taking in and at least immediately bringing back to their land the Christians among the local refugees, such as those from Ikrit and Bir'im, wherever they may have been dispersed.But Ikrit and Bir'im are no different from the sad human story of Al-Ghabisiyya, a village north of Acre that was depopulated by the IDF in 1951 and demolished in 1955, despite a ruling to the contrary by the High Court of Justice. Many of the residents were scattered in other locales in Israel. (For the details, in Hebrew, see Joseph Algazy's ""Defeatist Diary"" on the Web.) As I perceive Israeliness, wherever possible, they should be allowed to return, or compensated accordingly. For there were not only synagogues from earlier periods in many of these places; there were also churches and mosques and explicit High Court rulings.All of them have a place in the Israeliness I believe in and aspire to. It encompasses all the Israelis and all their histories together. Even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts. Without it, there will never be true independence here. Only ongoing enslavement to fears, rejections, enmity and never-sated war. There is no Independence without conciliation and no Nakba without forgiveness. Is it any wonder that on Independence Day 2014, we still have more Nakba and a lot less Independence?"

However, the decree's initial secrecy suggests Putin wishes to distance himself from the powerful Kremlin policy tool of the media onslaught.In the official gazette, there was a gap between decrees 278 and 280. Decree 279 remained unexplained until a Russian newspaper reported its contents on Monday, a fortnight after the event, offering a glimpse into how sensitive the use of propaganda has become in the East-West standoff over Ukraine.A Kremlin source, confirming that Putin signed the decree making the awards on April 22, said only: ""It was for internal use, not for public use.""To an outside observer, the propaganda war seems to have reached such a scale that it is all but impossible for Russians or Ukrainians to discover what is really going on from their national media.Many events are seen through a mist of disinformation or just confusion, a situation that suits Putin in what his critics believe is his attempt to undermine the Ukrainian authorities by portraying them as unable to control the country.The veracity of events is increasingly hard to check. When Russian media reported heavy fighting in the town of Kramatorsk this weekend, Reuters journalists on the scene shortly afterwards found a sleepy town with no evidence of clashes.Russian media deny they are part of a propaganda campaign and accuse Western journalists of bias, a charge that has found fertile ground in eastern Ukraine where some reporters have already been taken hostage or beaten.The Facebook page of Pavel Gubarev, a detained pro-Russian protest leader, has described journalists as ""catalysts of intolerance, hatred and violence"".""After lies follows pain,"" warned the page. MIS-MATCHEDAs on other fronts, the media fight between Moscow and Kiev is mis-matched.Russia's well-organised and well-financed state media have portrayed events in a style reminiscent of the Soviet era, peppering their reports with the message that Ukrainians, as during World War Two, may be cooperating with fascists.By contrast, Ukraine's fragmented media lack the single mindedness to answer the charges, remaining poorly financed and usually controlled by business tycoons who have been reluctant to offend business partners in Russia.Now largely switched off in the separatist-held regions in its east, Ukrainian television has so far failed to make the case for Kiev's new pro-Western leaders that pro-Russian rebels are in the pay of the Kremlin.That has been left to the Internet, where a war of words is raging as Ukraine prepares for three events: a May 25 presidential election, a May 11 referendum on independence in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and Friday's anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.All are possible flashpoints in a crisis where Russia could use clashes to justify an invasion of eastern Ukraine - which Putin has reserved the right to stage if he believes compatriots and Russian speakers need his protection.Several Russian newspapers used the same photo on Monday on their front page. This showed a man with flames licking up his sleeve as he throws a Molotov Cocktail into the burning trade union building in the Ukrainian city of Odessa, where dozens of pro-Russian separatists died after street fighting.Blaming Friday's trouble on far-right Ukrainian groups, the popular Komsomolskaya Pravda ran a banner headline declaring: ""Dirty scumbags!""Some Russian media likened the blaze to a World War Two Nazi massacre when all the residents of a Belarussian village were burnt alive.Ukraine's acting president, Oleksander Turchinov, tried to win back the initiative at the weekend, using his strongest language yet to condemn Russia for ""waging war against our country"", but lacking support his words failed to catch on.Other allegations by officials that only drunks and drug addicts follow the pro-Russians have also fallen flat, leaving it to Ukraine's bloggers to vent the widespread frustration with not only the pro-Russians but with their new leaders as well.""At the time of war, everyone lies,"" said a post on the ""Odessa on fire"" website, trying to defuse bitter debate over who was responsible for the more than 40 deaths on Friday. Such comment shows the depth of emotion as a struggle for influence in Ukraine threatens to tip the country into civil war.But while much of the Ukrainian blogosphere undermines their leaders, Russian media coverage is helping to boost support for Putin, whose ratings last week hit 82 percent - the highest since 2010.""Putin played a brilliant hand,"" said one post on a site called ""For Putin - For a Great Russia"", celebrating his moves to protect the economy from Western sanctions over Ukraine.""Putin has fooled the European Union and America and wasn't it great? Before the eyes of the whole world, he played them like a violin."" (Additional reporting by Alexei Anishchuk; editing by David Stamp)"

The MERS death toll in Saudi Arabia neared 100 this weekend as the authorities scrambled to reassure an increasingly edgy population in the country worst-hit by the infectious coronavirus. AFP PHOTO/STR (Photo credit should read -/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e0aea1f00002c0021d832.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL -- With cases of a virulent and highly fatal pathogen on the rise, including the first-known occurrence in the United States, epidemiologists and public health officials say some of their biggest concerns about the disease lie in the basic information that they still don't have about it.The virus, called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is closely related to SARS, which spread rapidly across Asia a decade ago, leaving some 800 people dead. So far, MERS, which has a higher fatality rate than SARS and no known vaccine or cure, has proven to be much less of a public health risk because its transmission rate, or how easy it is to spread between humans, has remained low.But there are anecdotal hints that the disease could be bucking that trend, including a dramatic uptick in the number of sick patients in Saudi Arabia, where the outbreak is centered. More than 400 people have been infected with the disease so far, almost all of them in the Middle East. The virus, which can cause ""severe acute respiratory illness,"" according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has killed about one-third of those who have contracted it.Official health groups like the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control still describe the risk of worldwide pandemic as low, but epidemiologists and public health experts say critical blank spots in the scientific understanding of the virus need to be filled in order to be sure.""We don't know exactly what's happening,"" said Dr. David Swerdlow, the head of the MERS monitoring team at the U.S. CDC. ""I think there are still some questions that are unanswered about how it's transmitted, how commonly it's occurring, what the prevalence is in the population, what is the spectrum of illness.""Until recently, infections from the disease largely seemed to occur in patients who had direct contact with an infected camel, which is believed to be the source of the disease, or with health care workers who spend extensive time with the most ill patients. But a recent report by the World Health Organization said that 75% of new infections were transmitted between humans alone, and most of the latest Saudi patients had no known exposure either to camels or health care facilities.That doesn't necessarily mean that the virus has mutated to become more easily transmissible, experts say. The spike could be related to poor health care procedures, or a higher vigilance for testing, or even a natural seasonal cycle of the virus, but it raises important questions that demand answers.""With this disease, if your epidemiologic data are a month old, it's outdated,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""Just what role does a lack of adequate respiratory protection in the healthcare setting play? I believe that we must entertain the possibility that there may be mildly ill or asymptomatically infected people who might transmit this.""One of the biggest challenges, some experts say, has been the fact that the current outbreak is centered in a series of countries -- including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- that are not accustomed to opening their facilities and bureaucracies to outside eyes.Until recently, that has meant a frustrating dearth of public information about the spread of the disease, and limited access for doctors who would like to inspect sick patients and hospital facilities.It also means that if the virus does mutate, something that could have potentially catastrophic implications, it might not be immediately known.""Without detailed information on the recent Saudi cases, it's really hard to do anything but guess,"" one infectious disease expert, Connie Savor Price of Denver Health and Hospital, recently told a leading online medical journal. ""We could guess endlessly.""A team from the World Health Organization is currently in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where they hope to learn important details about the disease's life cycle and whether it might have changed to become more easily transmitted.Osterholm said he doesn't think that change has happened -- at least not yet.""It doesn’t appear to have done that,"" he said. ""If it had we might expect to see more efficient human-to-human transmission, including in areas outside of Saudi Arabia. But with a virus like this, you have to view this as a journey, not a yes or no event.""Along the way, Osterholm said, even something as basic as understanding the way the virus leaps from camels to humans is crucial to preventing a worsening of the outbreak. Some experts have noted that Saudi traditions related to camels can make it difficult to limit contact with potentially ill animals.""With every transmission from an animal to a human you have to worry -- it's like another play at the genetic roulette table, and eventually one might hit the jackpot,"" Osterholm said. ""And when you have more human-to-human virus transmissions, that's even more evolutionary pressure to change. So I look at this like a process -- not where are we at today, but we have to look at where we could be tomorrow.""He added, ""Every day we're seeing more cases. We are hardly out of the woods yet."""

Brandon Leidel, CEO, Director of Operations Vapor Shark, said he welcomes the annoucement by the Food and Drug Administration that they are proposing the first federal regulations on electronic cigarettes, which would ban sales of the popular devices to anyone under 18 and require makers to gain FDA approval for their products. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30c1026000036008203c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Toni ClarkeMay 4 (Reuters) - When Noah Minskoff's mother died of lung cancer in 2007, e-cigarettes were just entering the U.S. market. Minskoff, who had just started medical school in Utah, wondered whether the devices might have saved his mother's life by helping her quit smoking. Later, he sent some samples to his boyhood friend Nathan Terry, a mechanical engineer, and asked for his opinion.Terry, who was working in Germany for the French industrial firm Areva, took apart the products to see how they were made. What he found disturbed him: at the heart of the devices were heater wires of unknown quality wrapped around bundles of glass fibers and surrounded by steel wool, silicon, plastic, tape and adhesives.Wires between the heater, circuit board and batteries were connected with lead solder and also housed in tape and plastic. Everything was close to the heat source, meaning consumers were at risk of inhaling fiber and metal particles as well as toxic fumes from hot plastic and lead.""There were red flags everywhere,"" Terry said.Still, he liked the concept and decided to design a version of his own, avoiding the use of fiberglass, plastic and solder and sourcing his materials entirely in the United States. In 2009 he reunited with Minskoff in California and formed a company, Thermo-Essence Technologies, to sell the product.At $300 a piece, the e-cigarette serves a niche market, albeit one with a loyal following among medical marijuana patients and smokers looking for a high-end e-cigarette. As many as 30,000 have been sold.But what began as a quest to develop a better e-smoke has broadened into an ambitious effort to design a new medical device: an inhaler that delivers measured doses of nicotine to help people quit smoking. The technology could also eventually be used as an abuse-resistant delivery device for other drugs, including opioid painkillers.If successful, the inhaler could become the first new smoking-cessation product to emerge from the e-cigarette field and would compete with products such as GlaxoSmithKline Plc's nicotine gum and Pfizer Inc's antismoking drug, Chantix. A STARTUP WITH BIOTECH FUNDINGTo develop the inhaler, Terry formed a second company, Minusa LLC, which is based in Newtown, Connecticut. Minskoff left Thermo-Essence for family reasons and is not involved in Minusa. Terry himself is leaving Thermo-Essence, which is currently being sold, to concentrate on Minusa.The new company obtained initial funding from Michael Breede, a commercial real-estate-turned-biotech investor whose father suffered from drug and alcohol addiction and who is eager to see an abuse-resistant painkiller device.""This is in my wheelhouse,"" he said. ""I think we can put a serious dent in this problem.""When Terry developed his e-cigarette he assumed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would begin regulating the industry, as it has recently done, proposing a ban on sales to people under the age of 18 and requiring companies to register. Later it could impose product standard and quality controls.Terry wanted to create a product that would pass any FDA inspection. He used a pure metal wire wrapped around a rod made from magnesia-stabilized zirconia, a highly durable ceramic material. Instead of meshes, tape and plastic he used novel porous ceramics and surgical-grade alloys, and instead of soldering parts together he connected them mechanically, fitting components together like Legos to complete the circuits.He built on that design to create his drug-delivery device, known as Envi, a single-user, tamper-resistant, metered-dose inhaler.Envi is about the size of a short cigar and comes with a spare in a case the size of a deck of playing cards.The nicotine or other drug will come in a sealed cartridge that the patient will insert into the inhaler. To activate the device, the user will have to enter a code. The inhaler will be programmed to deliver a certain amount of drug and then turn off.When the device is returned to the case, which is required after each dose to activate it for the next dose, data on the patient's usage will be downloaded and available to be viewed electronically by the prescribing physician.""It will only let you take your prescription,"" Terry said. ""It will log your usage and transmit it in real time, and make it easier for the doctor to monitor and interact with the patient."" BUILDING A BETTER INHALERTerry, 37, who grew up on an organic farm in Ohio to ""hippy commune"" parents and studied mechanical engineering at the University of Idaho, faces multiple challenges.Inhalers are typically more expensive to develop than pills, and ensuring patients get the right dose is more complicated.""I can see a lot of barriers, but the idea is certainly interesting,"" said Dr. Ben Forbes, a Reader in Pharmaceutics, broadly the equivalent of a U.S. professor, at King's College London who specializes in inhaled medications.There needs to be a good reason to target a drug to the lungs, Forbes said. Drugs that are inhaled may work faster than pills, so a device that offered quick pain relief in an abuse-resistant form would be ""brilliant"" if it could be produced economically, he added.""Changes in inhaler technology have been very incremental over the years, so maybe something like this would have a place.""In the meantime, big tobacco companies are developing alternative nicotine products they hope one day will carry a ""modified risk"" of harm. Some are dispensed through an inhaler.Unlike Terry's smoking-cessation device, which he plans to file with the FDA's drug division, these products would be marketed as less risky alternatives to smoking and be processed through the FDA's tobacco division.However smokers end up using the new products will be the subject of intense research by the FDA.Terry believes he is creating a product that will survive any market configuration. Minusa has a long way to go, and human trials may be two years off. Eventually he hopes to partner with a big drug company.""I think we can change how drugs are delivered.""
