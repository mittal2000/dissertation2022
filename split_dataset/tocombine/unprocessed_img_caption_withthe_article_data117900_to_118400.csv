Unfortunately in politics one of the oldest tricks in the book is to say and do something so insulting to the common sense and intelligence of the opposition that they completely abandon reason and strike back in an irrational and ultimately self-defeating manner. Dick Cheney is an old dog and is up to his usual dirty tricks, but I will not allow him or the bile that exits his mouth to incite me to irrational words or actions. Imagine a world without Dick Cheney in it. What a better place it would be. Well, at least can we just ignore him while he is here?I have written pieces on several occasions decrying his inane ramblings on affairs domestic and international. The latest incendiary barrage leveled against the president, defending Dick's War in Iraq. This ill-conceived and grossly mismanaged plan is universally acknowledged to be the deadliest miscalculation in modern history except by those who created it. The natural inclination in response to its continued defense is a sharp rebuke filled with profane invectives. But we will not go there; it only humors those who are immensely frustrated with the enormity of their failure.Going to war is without a doubt the most serious decision that a leader must confront. It requires every ounce of intellect, reasoning, factual examination, political dexterity, diplomatic consideration, compassion, and strength of conviction that a mere mortal possesses. The Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 was strong on conviction and marketing and short on all other counts. It was a bad decision that has seriously put this nation in a position of weakness and suspicion internationally, has shortchanged the American people by redirecting considerable financial resources away from investment in them and to wartime profiteers, has created a class of military veterans who struggle with deep wounds that have not been and may never be adequately treated, has energized a worldwide jihadist movement, and has left the millennial generation with no conception of a world without war.Imagine a surgeon who removes the wrong limb, then picture the patient continuing to consult the doctor for additional surgical advice. Absurd you say, who in their right mind would do such a thing? The answer is the news media. That's right, our information outlets. I don't care what qualifications or credentials the doctor possesses or claims to possess -- would you take your child back to this quack? Of course you wouldn't, yet here we are being buffeted by the likes of Cheney, Wolfowitz, Bremer, Kristol and other architects and apologists of a policy so fraught with miscalculation that in another setting it would qualify for criminal prosecution.Dick Cheney has not the least amount of credibility on the Iraq situation, either this one or the one 11 years ago. He has audaciously illustrated time and again that he has no capacity for self-reflection, introspection, analysis or questioning on issues that involve life and death on a large-scale. These qualities are important to human growth; Dick's growth was stunted at a very early age. He has every right to speak his mind, which is the hallmark of a free democratic society. But he also has a responsibility as both a leader and a former leader in such a society to evolve, to contribute to the betterment of society by examining his actions and thoughts, and correcting his mistakes. Refusal to admit mistakes and challenge one's own assumptions is the most selfish, irresponsible, and immature behavior that any leader, whether of a nation or a family, can exhibit and is reflective of insufficient capacity to lead.No human is infallible; everyone makes mistakes, true leaders own up to them. Dick Cheney's childishness does not deserve the print either he or his co-conspirators regularly receive. The only way to shut him down is to pay him no attention. That would be far more devastating to him than hurling verbal jousts that are richly deserved and instinctual to the well-adjusted and reasonable among us.So I offer this plea that in the name of all that is good, can we please refrain from giving Dick and his droogies a platform? The world would be a better place."
1,POLITICS,Republicans Hurl Harsh Accusations At Obama Administration,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-website-crash_n_5510013.html,,2014-06-19,"Ranking Member US Senator Chuck Grassley, R-IA, questions Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as she testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, February 13, 2013, on comprehensive immigration reform. Napolitano told the Senate that a new legalization law for illegal immigrants wonât lead to the same flood that followed the last amnesty in 1986, saying that the border has been secured too well for that to happen.

We immediately worked to fix the issues and developed new management processes,"" CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said in response to Thursday's report.The report cites an internal CMS assessment produced by the firm TurningPoint, which concluded that only 23 percent of HealthCare.gov's code had been tested at the time of the launch and that the HHS agency responsible for implementing Obamacare had no contingency plan for dealing with defects.The Republican report is the latest to chronicle administration missteps behind a policy disaster that helped pushed President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy and Democrats to the brink of political crisis late last year.Online Obamacare health insurance marketplaces, which offer subsidized private coverage to lower-income people, are the cornerstone of Obama's Affordable Care Act. But technical glitches overwhelmed HealthCare.gov for nearly two months until an emergency technology team revamped the website by Dec. 1, raising doubts about whether Obamacare would succeed.The site later worked well enough to accommodate large numbers of health insurance enrollees, and in the end, the administration and 14 states with their own exchanges signed up 8 million people in private health insurance, surpassing independent forecasts.

The museum spans seven stories, mostly underground, and contains artifacts from the attack on the World Trade Center Towers on September 11, 2001 that include the 80 ft high tridents, the so-called 'Ground Zero Cross,' the destroyed remains of Company 21's New York Fire Department Engine as well as smaller items such as letter that fell from a hijacked plane and posters of missing loved ones projected onto the wall of the museum. The museum will open to the public on May 21.

If it contributes to a growing national orgy of sustained mourning and co-option of others' loss -- looking back in personal terms as ""heroes"" one and all, at the expense of forward-looking resolve -- the fault lies with the initial commission and not the design team assembled to realize it. Firstly are those designers whose collective collaborations with the curatorial team led by American Studies scholar, Jan Ramirez, have been eclipsed by the Oslo/New York firm of Snøhetta, through no fault of its own. Founding partner, Craig Dyker, always described the oblique terrestrial glass and stainless steel foyer as a threshold between the living city and darkened silence of reflection below. A River Styx as sun-filled top hat. Such distorted credit began during the protracted decision-making project launched by Mayor Giuliani and brought to fruition by the Bloomberg team, propelled in part as they were by his enormous personal contributions towards its construction. Starting with the Libeskind master plan and its heavy dollop of capital ""F"" Freedom, there followed a demand for bonafide star architects along with an open memorial competition that together deflected disapproval and assured the approbation of a charitable elite.With sights on the White House, at least two New York politicians realized there was strategic capital to be gained from such tactics and the lead architects became their ingratiating brand. The opportunity today is to call attention to those who truly conceived the masterful subterranean realm in seamless synthesis with the exhibit's driving narrative. A downward ramp fades into blackness leading to a floating balcony overlooking the surviving ""bathtub"" slurry wall. After this pause of immensity, it then descends onwards to the intimate galleries set beneath the two memorial fountains above designed by competition winner, Michael Arad, and thus on the Trade Tower footprints themselves. This massive yet propulsive progression is the work of the largely unsung team of Davis Brody Bond. Following the death of Max Bond's initial leadership, architects Steve Davis, Carl Krebs, and Mark Wagner were the troika responsible.Their work, as the essential architectural achievement of the overall commission, succeeds as seamless complement to the exhibitions themselves: The unfolding and object-filled historical events of the day and its aftermath designed for the North Tower footprint by Layman Design (Dave Layman, principal);    and the memorial zone beneath the South Tower by THINC Design (Tom Hennes, principal). Distinct from the narrative storytelling of events, this second zone offers detailed and illustrated biographies of each victim in arguably excessive, nearly voyeuristic, extension of the more elegant abstraction of the bronze panel names arrayed aboveground at the lips of the memorial waterfalls. Yet again the condign execution of a politically driven mandate.  These professionals merit the spotlight awareness of fuller credit shining distinctly from the obscuring glare of the initial Snøhetta marquis. * * * * * *Another invisible architectural detail -- in this case structural rather than personal -- that has been overlooked by the multi-billion dollar 13-year redevelopment in all its interconnected complexity is the fact that one minute section of what defined the Seven Tower, 13,400,000 square feet of the original WTC complex still stands. It is an anonymous newsstand with no plaque or notice, hidden in plain sight and recalled only by a diminishing few who collected their daily papers before crossing the Center's threshold.One part of the 16-acre superblock whole was an underground shopping concourse that simultaneously served as weather-protected connective tissue between the various structures and to two mass transit systems: The NYC subway and the PATH service to New Jersey. It was just one piece of the overall design puzzle by Minoru Yamasaki along with an associate team from Emory Roth & Sons, as engineered by the firm of Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson. At the south end of the E Train subway terminus, still bearing the World Trade Center name as renovated with the ceramic wall mosaics collectively entitled Oculus by Andrew Ginzel & Kristin Jones, this last built relic functions daily beneath the original sign ""newsstand & novelties"" with what used to start with WTC and is now beguilingly covered merely with black masking tape which begs for removal as what might be the easiest act of historic preservation imaginable on the globe today.  Thus it stands as the single testament to all that stood before. The typeface font seems to be the oddly labeled Akzienz Grotesk BQ Medium by the old German type foundry of H. Berthold. Yet sadly no one seems to know who was responsible for the graphic program of the original concourse or for that matter the Trade Center as a whole. The shopping mall operator both before the 9/11 attacks and now set to reopen it is Westfield Group, which ignored several attempts for comment, while all other queries came up short, including the AIGA and Milton Glaser (who famously designed as the graphic gesamtkunstwerk, the North Tower's crowning Windows on the World suite of restaurants.) Likewise, Chermayeff & Geismar; none knew. Even the Memorial Museum curators cannot say despite the fact that the handiwork of this anonymous master enlivens many of the preserved exhibit artifacts and even in some ingenuous cases are used anew as defining guideposts that echo their original design assignment. When the team responsible emerges they will get the credit thus far denied, meanwhile the mystery itself underscores how far too often the many professionals that make up the collaborative whole of any building are, like the masons of Europe's great cathedrals, invisible to history even when recorded with limitless resources.""...newsstand & novelties"" can also conjure past examples where some original or otherwise pre-existing architectural fabric blends in mute service to subsequent renewal or expansion. Unlike the spoglia of past achievement when the parts are stripped and reused like Roman columns removed and repurposed or, unlike the Pantheon of the Great Mosque of Cordoba where an edifice is left intact but assigned a new identity, these are instances when the existing structure is instead subsumed.  One local example is The Medieval Hall of Calvert Vaux's first iteration of New York's Metropolitan Museum (best known for the location of the annual Neapolitan Christmas tree) where the lofty room melds into both its Beaux-Arts and later Modernist extensions enveloping it.  Likewise, the accessible and still functioning crypt of St. Peter's Basilica remains from its 4th-century precedent,   while along Bloomingdale's block-long East 60th Street frontage the original store's 19th-century face blends seamlessly, yet is discernible with the present-day elevation. It quietly does its job.  Paradoxically, such silent preservation is perhaps the most vital as a result of its uninterrupted structural integrity. This anonymous little store will endure as the truest testament of what was there and all that was lost. It stands as the purest expression of memory possible: A memory encased in continuing function at the service of architecture and its modern demands."
3,POLITICS,Why Women Deserve Better From Washington,"Jason Ritchie, ContributorDad to Charlie and Sam, small business owner, and candidate fo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-deserve-better_b_5510147.html,"Just look at who voted for the Lily Ledbetter Act of 2009. If your representative voted 'Nay', they believe that women should be paid less than men. Let's get these 'Mad Men' out of office and allow common sense to prevail.",2014-06-19,"BERLIN, GERMANY - MARCH 21: Flags reading 'Equal Pay Day' are seen during the 'Equal Pay Day' demonstration on March 21, 2014 in Berlin, Germany. The annual event recognizes the wage gap between the sexes in the country, where women's salaries still lag behind that of men, particularly in the states that were once East Germany. (Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cd8a210000d601c96211.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just two days ago President Obama made news in Pittsburgh by stating that equal pay for equal work not only benefits women, but also benefits families. In April, he signed an executive order that allows federal workers to share salary information and requires federal contractors to disclose more information about what their employees earn. On June 23, the Obama Administration will host a summit in Washington D.C. that focuses on creating a 21st century workplace, which includes equal pay for equal work.The fact that this is still a topic that is making headlines in 2014 is alarming. Almost half of the American workforce is female. In more and more situations, women are the primary breadwinners in their families. Pay disparity doesn't just hurt women. It hurts their kids and their families. It hurts all Americans.Opponents of equal pay have tried many times to explain away the wage gap. The most common argument they offer is that it simply does not exist. Opponents say that pay disparity based on gender is not based on sexism or discrimination, but rather on the choices that women make in terms of education, hours, and children. They argue that it is the biological and social forces that lead to a pay gap and therefore there is no point in pushing through legislation that could not possibly combat these realities. Opponents claim that discrimination isn't the cause of the pay gap and that laws combating discrimination are not the solution. Thankfully, the modern workplace has advanced beyond Mad Men-style sexism. However, this does not mean that discrimination is no longer a factor.Senior advisers at the Department of Labor agree, ""Discrimination is the best explanation of the remaining difference in pay."" Economists across the political spectrum attribute at least 40 percent of the pay gap to discrimination, not differences between workers or their jobs.Sexual discrimination and the pay gap it causes are real problems and must be addressed.Women earn an average 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, less if they are also a minority. In some professions, this gap is smaller. In others it's wider. But no matter what the profession, even if it's 'only' a loss of 10 cents on the dollar, the gap is there, and it is solely related to the gender of the worker.The solution is to elect representatives who recognize that equal work deserves equal pay, and that family wages are more important than corporate earnings. Just look at who voted for the Lily Ledbetter Act of 2009. If your representative voted 'Nay', they believe that women should be paid less than men. Let's get these 'Mad Men' out of office and allow common sense to prevail.We are a nation founded on equality, built and sustained by women as well as men. Gender discrimination is completely and categorically unacceptable. Not only have women earned equal pay, they deserve it."

Again it speak volumes about the rest... haha by now it should be apparent that I come from a family of doctors! The best thing that's been said about me... is that I have a kind heart. Now if this is always true is another matter.The biggest misconception about me... is that I spend my time attending parties. I love having fun but the biggest source of passion and amusement for me is my work. I am a Sagittarius. I do everything in bucketfuls.If I weren't doing what I'm doing today... I would probably be a plastic surgeon. Somewhere there is a connection in all of this.My legacy... My legacy?

6,GREEN,Don't Poison Me! A Big Win for Baby Owls (Like This One) and Other Wildlife,"Alison Hermance, ContributorWildlife writer, WildCare's Wildlife Hospital",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-poison-me-a-big-win-_b_5441231.html,"With luck, and with the successful implementation of the EPA regulations, no poisons will enter this owl family's food chain and this little owlet will grow up strong and healthy.",2014-06-18,Lifting the box containing the owlet into the tree,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-04-jimliftsbox-thumb.JPG,"WildCare's Wildlife Hospital treats nearly 4,000 ill, injured and orphaned wild animal patients from over 200 species every year. This is one patient's story.The thought of this fluffy baby owl being fed rat poison is beyond horrifying, but it's a real possibility as long as the most dangerous rat poisons (rodenticides) can be bought easily and cheaply at the corner hardware store. When this baby came to WildCare's Wildlife Hospital after being found huddled under the tree from which he had fallen, his rescuers told us they had seen his mother and father in the redwood trees near their house for several years. The pair had successfully raised several broods of baby owls, which is fantastic news for these very threatened birds.This baby's rescuers would never use rat poisons because of the danger to ""their"" owls, but what if a neighbor decided to put out some d-CON rat bait?When radiographs and an exam revealed this owlet to be perfectly healthy after his tumble, we knew he could go back to his parents' care. Meanwhile, breaking news from the war against rodenticide use increased our confidence that this owl would have a long and healthy life in the wild.The battle against the use of dangerous rodenticides seems to be ""two steps forward, one step back,"" but it is definitely moving in the right direction for this little owl and his family.As soon as rescuers stepped onto the Mill Valley property this owlet came from, one of the parent Northern Spotted Owls swooped past and perched in a nearby tree while a Northern Spotted Owl expert from Point Blue placed an identifying band around the owlet's leg. Meanwhile, Hungry Owl Project and WildCare raptor experts and our volunteer arborist, Jim Cairnes of Small World Tree Company scoped out the tree under which the baby had been found and determined the best place for the climb.After quickly setting his ropes and climbing the tree, it was time for Cairnes to pull up the baby owl and place him gently on a branch. With an owl of this age, known as a ""brancher,"" this is definitely the most stressful part of the reunite process.Branchers are older than nestlings, and have started moving out of the nest to learn to hop, navigate branches and start to stretch their wings and experiment with the idea of flying. Branchers are very mobile and won't necessarily sit still where they are placed. This is when it is most likely an owlet will fall (as this one did), or jump.Indeed, after he was carefully placed on a solid branch, this owlet took matters into his own, er, wings and hopped off the other side, fortunately landing on branch (albeit a slightly less solid one) below. As Cairnes descended the tree and the baby teetered on the branch, watchers spotted the owlet's mother soaring past with a rat in her talons, probably a meal she had stashed for her babies.Immediately concerns about rat poison, not on the owls' home property, but in their larger territory, struck observers.As most of you know, when a hawk or an owl eats a rodent that has eaten rat poison (rodenticide), that hawk, owl or other predator also becomes poisoned. Click here to learn more about the dangers of these deadly poisons to wildlife.This is especially concerning when a young owl of a threatened species is involved. WildCare's Rodenticide Diagnostics and Advocacy Program (RDAP) has sent samples from hundreds of wild patients to the lab to test for rodenticide exposure, and a shocking 76.8 percent of animals in 2013 tested positive for exposure to these rat poisons. These poisons are far too prevalent in our environment, and wild animals are paying the price.Last Friday, however, the anti-rodenticide movement got some good (and surprising!) news. Reckett Benckiser, the makers of d-CON, America's number one rodent control brand, announced an agreement with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the production and distribution of certain highly dangerous types of rodenticide pellets.The 12 d-CON products are being discontinued because they do not meet EPA's current safety standards. Eight of the products contain the dangerous ""second-generation anticoagulants"" that WildCare's rodenticide testing data has shown are so dangerous to wildlife, and none of the products are considered packaged properly to prevent children and pets from coming into contact with them.Why was Reckitt Benckiser's announcement a surprise? In February of 2013, the US EPA had issued a ""Notice of Intent to Cancel"" these twelve products, which seemed to be great news for wildlife until the manufacturer opted to contest the cancellation through an administrative hearing process. While the hearing process continued, these deadly products would continue to be widely available to consumers. With the specter of the hearing process looming for years to come, WildCare and other anti-rodenticide advocates despaired.But then a light at the end of the tunnel -- for California wildlife, at least. At the beginning of 2014, the California EPA's Department of Pesticide Regulation issued a ruling to make the four most dangerous second generation anticoagulant rodenticide compounds unavailable to regular consumers as of July 1, 2014.These four compounds make up the active ingredients in eight of the 12 d-CON products being discontinued, and the ruling meant that in California, the products that WildCare's testing have shown to be the most deadly to wildlife would no longer be readily available to consumers.Getting these products off the shelves of neighborhood hardware stores means good things for wildlife like this family of Northern Spotted Owls. While the products would still be available to licensed pest control operators, our concerns that a neighbor in the same area of Mill Valley as these owls would decide to put out some rodenticide bait would be significantly lessened.With luck, and with the successful implementation of the EPA regulations, no poisons will enter this owl family's food chain and this little owlet will grow up strong and healthy.In the video below, watch as the mother owl calls her baby across the treetops to her side and begins feeding him bits of the rat she brought.WildCare is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization supported almost entirely by private donations and individual memberships. Visit us online at wildcarebayarea.org and please consider a donation to help us feed our owl patients. Whether they are with us for a day or a month, baby owls like this this one need a lot of care and feeding. Donate today at wildcarebayarea.org/feedowls"

This showcase of American deceit, obvious to the entire world, began with the invented weapons of mass destruction threat that Bush, were he even semi-cognizant of the intelligence data, must have known represented an egregious fraud. So was his nonsensical claim that Saddam Hussein had something to do with the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, when in fact he was Osama bin Laden's most effective Arab opponent.Yet Bush responded to the 9/11 attacks by overthrowing a leader who had banished al-Qaida from Iraq and who had been an ally of the United States in the war to contain Iran's influence in the region. Instead of confronting the funders of Sunni extremism based in Saudi Arabia, the home of 15 of the 19 hijackers and their Saudi leader bin Laden, Bush chose to attack the secular leader of Iraq. That invasion, as the evidence of the last week confirms, resulted in an enormous boon to both Sunni extremists and their militant Shiite opponents throughout the Mideast.How pathetic that Secretary of State John Kerry is now reduced to begging the ayatollahs of Iran to come to the aid of their brethren in Iraq. Or that the movement to overthrow the secular leader of Syria, a movement supported by the United States, has resulted in a base for Sunni terrorists in Iraq and Syria of far greater consequence than the one previously used to plot the 9/11 attacks from isolated Afghanistan.Imagine if Barack Obama had succumbed to his critics' demands that he supply the insurgents in Syria with sophisticated weaponry? Those weapons would now be turned against the fragmenting Iraqi army that the United States trained at an enormous cost. Or if he had chosen military confrontation with Iran instead of diplomacy in dealing with Iran's nuclear program, leaving the Shiite leaders of Iraq squeezed between enemies on two fronts. The elected government in Iraq has a chance to survive only because Obama gave peace a chance in choosing to negotiate with the government of Iran.The only error Obama made in ending the U.S. military role in Iraq was not moving fast enough to disengage from Bush's nation-building fantasies. Where is the evidence that it ever works, particularly in the Mideast? The United States has backed the military ruling class in Egypt for more than three decades, and the instant the much-hoped-for transition to democracy appeared, those same corrupt generals scurried for safety to the embrace of oil drenched Saudi religious fanatics. Libya's Moammar Gadhafi is now gone, only to be replaced by militants given to an even harsher brand of oppression. Yet a bipartisan consensus of Washington politicians still believes that the overthrow of the secular leader of Syria is somehow consistent with the proclaimed goals of the war on terrorism.It obviously isn't, as the anti-Assad Sunni militants who now freely cross the border from Syria to Iraq waving flags in support of al-Qaida have attested. It is further evidence that dealing with terrorism in militaristic battle terms rather than as a social pathology to be treated as an illness is a dangerous diversion. The war on terrorism is as irrational a concept as a war on cancer or the flu in that it assumes that the military arsenal is the deciding factor when it never is, for long. The seeds of radical discontent throughout the world, but particularly in the Mideast, derive from myriad complex and intertwined causes. In this region, the obvious sources of tension in religious grievances, stagnant economies and frustrated nationalism -- as with the obviously legitimate demands of Palestinians and Kurds -- have been wildly exacerbated down through the centuries by the imperial ambitions of non-regional actors. Those prisoners of imperial hubris always underestimated the resilience of the occupied and came to believe their own lies about being crusaders for enlightenment.That is a dangerous delusion energetically asserted by the Paul Wolfowitzes and Dick Cheneys even now, as their mad schemes for a reinvented Mideast spectacularly disintegrate. In their minds, it is still deeply felt that if only Obama had stayed the course of occupation, we would be greeted as liberators, while our corporations quietly sucked up their oil. Presidential candidate Obama made clear his contempt for that neocon pipe dream. Once elected, in regard to winding down the Iraq War, he has not strayed far from that conviction, and on this he much deserves our support. This is so even if it means going through the next decades of our political life arguing about ""Who Lost Iraq?"" the way we once argued about ""Who Lost China?"" -- ignoring that neither country was truly ours to lose."

AFP PHOTO / Karen BLEIER (Photo credit should read KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cd672200004301dd7955.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are at least 11,986 convicted stalkers living in the United States right now who can walk into a store, pass a background check and legally purchase a firearm, according to a report released Wednesday by the Center for American Progress.Between 2001 and 2012, more women were shot to death in the U.S. by an intimate partner than the total number of U.S. troops killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. But while U.S. federal law prohibits persons convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from purchasing a gun, the law has so many gaps and loopholes that tens of thousands of known domestic abusers can still either legally buy a gun or are never properly reported into the background check system.Convicted stalkers and non-married, non-cohabiting dating partners who commit domestic abuse, for instance, are not included in U.S. gun restrictions relating to domestic violence. But these categories of abusers can be just as dangerous with a gun as a spouse convicted of misdemeanor abuse. The CAP report cites a study of female murder victims in 10 cities that found that three-quarters of women murdered, and 85 percent of women who survived a murder attempt by a current or former intimate partner, had been stalked in the previous year. And nearly half of all intimate partner homicides are committed by a dating partner who is not covered by federal gun restrictions. ""Stalkers and dating partners are critical loopholes in our gun laws,"" said Arkadi Gerney, one of the authors of the report.Gerney noted that Elliot Rodger, the Santa Barbara, California student who went on a shooting rampage last month, admitted to having stalked a sorority house in the previous year. ""Not all stalking behavior is going be caught before a shooting,"" Gerney said, ""but in cases where they are and there is a restraining order, those people shouldn't have access to guns."" While nine states have laws that prevent convicted stalkers from purchasing guns, federal law only applies to spouses and perpetrators living under the same roof as the victim. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has introduced a bill, the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act, that would close that loophole.But legally prohibiting domestic abusers from purchasing guns is toothless if states do not provide all records of prohibited abusers to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). And the CAP report has found that only three states appear to be submitting ""reasonably complete"" records -- Connecticut, New Hampshire and New Mexico. Seventy-nine percent of all records submitted to the FBI for background checks are from those three states alone. ""That doesn't mean other states aren't attempting to check for restraining orders, but in some cases, people with restraining orders out against them are slipping through the cracks,"" Gerney said. ""We want to make sure all dangerous people are prohibited from purchasing guns, and all prohibited people have been researched and put into the FBI's NICS index so there is a definite red light when those people attempt to buy a gun."" Until this year, passing legislation to prevent domestic abusers from owning guns has been very difficult on a state level, due to heavy opposition from gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association. But even the NRA is now backing down from the fight and adapting to changing public opinion on the issue. A number of gun-friendly states, including Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, have passed legislation in the last year that strengthens or adds gun restrictions for domestic abusers. On a federal level, the Senate was unable to pass a bill last year that would have strengthened background checks on gun sales. But Klobuchar's bill to broaden the definition of domestic abusers to include stalkers and dating partners could be an easier political lift this year. Americans for Responsible Solutions, the well-funded gun violence prevention PAC started by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), has calculated through its polling that independent and Republican women voters in swing states are aligned with Democrats in wanting to pass legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. One of ARS' recent polls in Texas found that 85 percent of women and 68 percent of men in that state favor a law requiring that stalkers turn in their guns.Closing a few major loopholes through Klobuchar's bill, a stronger federal background checks law, and increased efforts by states to improve their submission of flagged records to the FBI ""would undoubtedly save the lives of hundreds of American women every year,"" the CAP report concludes.

Guinea's Foreign Minister Francois Fall said on April 14 that the west African country had brought the spread of the deadly Ebola virus under control after more than 100 people have died. The outbreak is one of the most deadly, with 168 cases 'clinically compatible' with Ebola virus disease reported, including 108 deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest update on April 14.

World Health Organization said on Wednesday, as weak local health services struggle to contain the highly contagious disease.WHO said 47 new cases and 14 deaths had been reported in the region in the last week alone, months after international experts were first sent to help tackle the widest-spread outbreak of Ebola recorded in Africa.Guinea remains worst affected, with 264 Ebola-related deaths, the WHO data showed, but the toll in Sierra Leone and Liberia has recently spiked, hitting 49 and 24 respectively.WHO has tried to coordinate the regional response but imposing the restrictions needed to control such an infectious disease has proven difficult. WHO said last month an earlier dip in cases masked the seriousness of the outbreak.WHO's spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said more work needed to be done in tracing possible victims and ensuring more people report to health facilities to increase their chances of recovery and avoid infecting others.The outbreak has been made more complicated because it involves multiple locations in 3 countries, and frequent cross-border movements by people, she said.""This makes this one of the most challenging Ebola outbreaks ever,"" she said by email.Guinea's new cases were reported in Gueckedou, a remote southeast region where the outbreak was first confirmed, but also in Boffa, hundreds of kilometers (miles) to the northwest of the capital city Conakry.Liberia reported four deaths in its capital Monrovia on Tuesday, the first to be confirmed in the sprawling ramshackle seaside city.Sierra Leone's toll has risen rapidly since it confirmed its first deaths in late May.The outbreak has led to some restrictions on flights and trade in the region but international mining firms operating in the three countries say operations have not yet been affected.Discovered in 1976 after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent and there is no vaccine and no known cure.The virus initially causes raging fever, headaches, muscle pain, conjunctivitis and weakness, before moving into more severe phases of causing vomiting, diarrhea and hemorrhages.

Denson claims that the invasive procedures used to search her led to a premature birth. But several juries found no fault on U.S. Customs agents or nurses at the Florida hospital where she was searched. Today, she's suing the hospital and Dr. John Bennett, who treated her.According to court documents from one of her lawsuits in 2009, Denson was stopped by customs agents at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport after her return flight from Jamaica on Feb. 14, 1997. She was questioned, arrested and taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital where she was ""required to pass three separate drug-free stool samples."" To induce bowel movements, a doctor prescribed her the laxative GoLytely -- which Denson claims was not recommended for pregnant women, according to the Orlando Sentinel.There was no evidence of drugs in her system. She was sent on her way after two days in the hospital.The 39-year-old West Palm Beach woman says that negligence led to a complicated pregnancy and the premature birth of her now-17-year-old son. She also complained of diarrhea, stomach cramps and vaginal bleeding.""I really couldn't believe what was happening to me,"" she told the Orlando Sentinel. ""I was told on several occasions that I had to drink it. If I did not drink it, I would not be able to leave.""Nobody denies that she was compelled to take laxatives at the hospital. But the defense claims that laxatives couldn't have forced a premature birth, and that hospital staff was only doing its job.Plus, her initial arrest was justified, federal courts have found. Not only was Denson acting suspicious before her arrest at the airport, but she was carrying a peculiar note that appeared to be a cover story she should memorize should she ever be questioned by police.

12,POLITICS,Imagine If Bill O'Reilly Said Robert Bergdahl 'Looked Like a Jew',"H. A. Goodman, ContributorColumnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/imagine-the-day-a-lawmake_b_5506496.html,"The reason it's ""totally inappropriate"" to look Muslim or speak Pastho (ironically, we've been in Afghanistan for over a decade helping people who speak Pashto) is because such sentiments pander to the prejudice and biases possessed by certain viewers of Fox, as well as certain Republican voters.",2014-06-18,TODAY -- Pictured: Bill O'Reilly appears on NBC News' 'Today' show -- (Photo by: Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cd66250000cf003a516f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a Jewish American, and as an author, my imagination is sometimes influenced by my cultural upbringing. It helped me write one of my first articles and it enables me to put myself in the shoes of other ethnic groups. I wonder how I would feel if someone said a public figure ""looked Jewish"" and then explained that this was ""totally unacceptable."" Furthermore, I'm particularly aware of how words are utilized to demonize and marginalize people; especially when seemingly commonplace observations exploit bias and prejudice.  Bill O'Reilly said Bergdahl's father ""looks like a Muslim."" What's wrong with that? When political context is taken into account alongside an observation of someone's physical appearance (or facial hair, dress, and language), then such statements should be scrutinized. As quoted in Adolph Hitler: Biography and Character by Southern Utah University, Hitler wrote about the day he first saw Jews in Vienna:""One day when I was walking through the inner city, I suddenly came upon a being clad in a long caftan, with black curls. Is this also a Jew? At Linz they certainly did not look like that. Secretly and cautiously I watched the man, but the longer I stared at this strange face the more mind reshaped the first question into another form: is this a German?""Hitler goes on to explain how the appearances of these Jews tarnished the city. This first, seemingly ordinary encounter set the stage for far greater observations on the differences between Jews and everyone else. As for the correlation between bias and the appearance of a political rival or enemy, Harvard University's Karthik Narayanaswami analyzed the oftentimes nefarious link between prejudice, bias and the appearance of a targeted group. In ""Analysis of Nazi Propaganda,"" he explains the link between marginalizing the appearance of a political enemy within propaganda posters:By exploiting existing stereotypes and the sentiments of the German people, Nazi propaganda sought to target those whom it considered either an enemy or unworthy of being a citizen... The author of Pinheads and Patriots and Culture Warrior is no stranger to the ""us vs. them"" theme and the utilization of biases to delineate rival and ally, but he's no Adolf Hitler. He's not a Nazi and Fox News isn't the reincarnation of Nazi propaganda.Conservative media pundits like Bill O'Reilly and lawmakers do, however, utilize the appearance, or attributes, of their political opponents in order to define them as ""the other."" The Republican Willie Horton ad is an example that initially comes to mind. Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson has a beard, but he's not chastised by Bill O'Reilly. There is an overt reason for choosing to focus on Bergdahl's beard but not the beards of Duck Dynasty stars. Conservatives have gone so far as to try to rename French fries into ""Freedom Fries,"" so symbolism is extremely important to some people.   Whereas Bill O'Reilly has accused others of taking a page from Joseph Goebbels, in reality, he and other conservative media pundits and lawmakers utilize prejudice associated with a political rival's religion or ethnic background. Think Michele Bachmann's accusations of Anthony Weiner's wife Huma Abedin, the Ground Zero mosque uproar, and the tens of thousands of times Fox News has uttered the words ""Islamic terrorists"" (without mentioning the tens of thousands of Muslims they kill). Conservative pundits like O'Reilly overtly utilize the passions of many conservative voters, under the guise of simple observation, while knowing full well such statements are fueled by xenophobia and hatred. How do I know this? Well, if you're reading this and think Bill O'Reilly is simply making a benign observation about Sgt. Bergdahl's father, then read the explanation of his original comments in The Washington Post:O'Reilly: ""A: he absolutely looked like a Muslim. B: he talked in Pashto, the language of the Taliban. And C: he thanked Allah. I thought the appearance was totally inappropriate. I said it. I will stand by it. Why am I being injected into that?"" Then, after reading the explanation, utilize the same comments in a different context, and see how these words sound. If the words (attributed to different ethnic groups) convey a different meaning, that's Mr. Goebbels smiling from a fiery inferno down below.So let's have some fun; Bizarro Superman kind of fun. Imagine this is 2008 and Wall Street has collapsed, the economy is close to a depression, and a man named Bernie Madoff is shown on television. Imagine Bill O'Reilly putting up an image of a New York Post cover showing Maddoff with the caption ""The Most Hated Man In New York."" Imagine for a moment Bill O'Reilly is referring to this cover, in the context of financial turmoil, and saying the following: ""He absolutely looked Jewish, wearing that black brim hat and black overcoat. He knows how to read Hebrew. He's thanked God, or at least his view of God, before. I thought his appearance was totally inappropriate. I said it. I will stand by it. Why am I being injected into that?""How does that sound, if times and political correctness were different? There's nothing overtly hateful, but it would of course sound blatantly anti-Semitic.The reason it's ""totally inappropriate"" to look Muslim or speak Pastho (ironically, we've been in Afghanistan for over a decade helping people who speak Pashto) is because such sentiments pander to the prejudice and biases possessed by certain viewers of Fox, as well as certain Republican voters. When seemingly simple observations are made within the context of the passions and prejudices of people who assign negative emotions towards a certain ethnic group, we have Bill O'Reilly's latest comments.When the political winds ever change (or revert back to where they were for centuries), and it's acceptable to say the things conservative media hosts and lawmakers say about Muslims in relation to Jews, then we'll know when such a precedent was set. The more we allow influential people to denigrate one group, the easier it will be in the future to denigrate Jews, and other groups who've suffered from centuries of persecution."

But on another level, the current games to crown the quadrennial world champion couldn't be more Catholic. Most obviously, the host nation, Brazil, is home to largest Catholic population on earth, and one of its most iconic symbols is Christ the Redeemer commissioned by the Church in Rio de Janeiro in the 1930s. Another Catholic country and soccer powerhouse, Italy, committed near sacrilege when RAI TV dressed the gargantuan Brazilian statue in Italy's instantly recognizable blue soccer jersey. The Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro is suing the Italian TV station for millions of dollars since the iconic Christ was photoshopped and flashed across the small screen without diocesan permission.Brazil is also home to the world's largest Pentecostal population, but their relative absence from the Cup reinforces its Catholic tenor. In fact, the country's second largest Pentecostal denomination, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God has called for a boycott on watching the Cup as part of a forty day ""Fast of Jesus,"" which started just two days before opening game day. While there are five Evangelical players on the Brazilian squad many Protestants in the host nation and throughout Latin America are repulsed by the ""ungodly"" atmosphere at many games that often include heaving drinking, fights and even occasional murders, such as that of a Brazilian referee who was recently decapitated.Beyond Brazil, the Cup is essentially a contest between Latin America and Europe in which the predominantly Catholic countries stand out. In Latin America only Uruguay and Honduras are no longer Catholic-majority nations. Mexico, home to the world's second largest Catholic population, and Colombia, historically one of the most devout nations, bring fans who ask the Holy Child of Miracles, among other saints, to aid in victory on the pitch. And of course, the dramatic novelty at this World Cup, is a Latin American pope who is an ardent fan of Argentine soccer. He's promised Brazilians to remain neutral in his prayers, but I'm sure we would all forgive him for an extra word with the Virgin of Lujan (the Argentine patroness) on behalf of star player Messi and company.Although two European nations that aren't predominantly Catholic, Germany and the Netherlands, have played the best soccer so far, the participation of historically Catholic nations adds to the influence of the Roman version of the faith. Current champion Spain, and traditional powerhouses Italy, France, and Portugal don't have many of the Latin American style fans who ask the saints to perform miracles on the field, such as the Argentine star's, Maradona, infamous ""hand of God"" goal against England in which he pushed the ball into the net with his hand behind the back of the referee. While fans from these countries generally don't bring an active Catholicism to the Cup, their enthusiastic participation in the carnivalesque atmosphere that prevails during the month of the games adds to the Catholic vibe of the championship tournament in Brazil. Carnival itself, of course, is a specifically Catholic festivity, which was brought to Brazil by the Portuguese.In addition to the Catholic flavor of the Cup, the event itself is eminently catholic (with a small ""c"") in that it is the most universal of games played by the great majority of the world. As an American who started playing in middle school in the 1970s when soccer was just beginning in the U.S., I always feel a great connection to the rest of the world through this, the most global of sports. Married to a Mexican woman and having lived and studied in Brazil, I'm fortunate to have three teams to root for. Hopefully Team USA won't make an early exit, as notoriously predicted by coach Klinsmann, but if they do I'll probably be left with at least one of the two largest Catholic countries, Brazil and Mexico, to cheer on to victory."

Espaillat, a 57-year-old Dominican-American, has shown growing popularity in a district that now has more Latino-Americans than African-Americans.

Charlie Rangel's (D-N.Y.) campaign called an accusation by his main rival's staffer that he had sent out false eviction notices to his constituents an ""unconscionable lie"" on Wednesday.Rangel was responding to charges made Tuesday on Twitter by Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for one of his Democratic primary opponents, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat. The congressman is running for his 23rd term in the House.Smith called sending out false eviction notices a ""disgusting tactic"" and suggested that the alleged notices were meant to depress turnout in the June 24 primary. Rangel's campaign rejected Smith's accusations and asked Espaillat to apologize in a Wednesday press release. ""Congressman Rangel marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to secure the right to vote, and he has fought his entire career in Congress to protect that fundamental right,"" Rangel senior advisor Charlie King said in the release. ""For the Espaillat campaign to wildly accuse the Congressman of voter suppression with no evidence whatsoever is ugly and divisive politics at its worst. It's simply unconscionable.""""Senator Espaillat should apologize for making such irresponsible accusations and stick to the issues,"" King continued. ""We all recognize that is hard for him because he has no record to talk about, but character assassination through unsupported attacks is truly beyond the pale. Shame on Senator Espaillat for bringing this campaign into the gutter -– his campaign has lost all credibility.""Smith told the New York Observer Tuesday that Espaillat's campaign had received ""a few calls"" about the notices.Rangel defeated Espaillat by fewer than 1,100 votes in 2012. If Espaillat wins the Democratic nomination, he would be expected to make history as the first Dominican-American representative in the House. Rangel, who was elected in 1970, is a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. UPDATE -- 2:55 p.m.:Espaillat Campaign Manager Jesse Campoamor stuck by Smith's accusation in an email to the Huffington Post Wednesday.“Congressman Rangel has distributed deceptive fliers claiming to have the Presidents’ endorsement, when in reality the President said he should end his career with dignity,"" Campoamor wrote. ""He told voters at last weeks debate he was with Democrats like Nancy Pelosi on Wall Street reform when his voting record proved otherwise. He sent out a laughable mailer last week suggesting Senator Adriano was linked to Sarah Palin. He's bizarrely claimed he had no connection with attacks launched by his own paid spokesman. Who else could possibly be behind these already discredited fliers? This latest dirty trick is another reason why voters across the district want change – but while Congressman Rangel takes the low road, Adriano Espaillat will be spending the last week sharing his vision on affordable housing, smart economic development and taking guns off the streets.”"

Five of them are set out below.1) The Law of Unintended Consequences: Just as during the run up to the 2003 intervention in Iraq, advocates of military action are stressing the alleged upsides without considering the potential negative consequences. Former Reagan administration official Kenneth Adelman famously asserted that a war in Iraq would be a ""cake walk."" Ten years, hundreds of thousands of American and Iraqi casualties, and several trillion dollars later, we should know better. Many of the loudest voices calling for military action are the same people who helped launch the 2003 intervention in Iraq, which was one of the greatest foreign policy disasters in U.S. history. This time no one is talking about ""boots on the ground"" -- yet -- but starting with air strikes could easily lead to deeper U.S. involvement once it is clear that bombing is having no effect.2) There Is No Military Solution: It will be extremely difficult to identify and target members of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in an irregular war, much of which is being conducted in urban areas where civilian casualties will be inevitable. In addition to causing unnecessary suffering and death, the likely result of a U.S. bombing campaign would be a propaganda victory for ISIS and a backlash against the United States in Iraq and the region.  3) It Makes No Sense to Prop Up the al-Maliki Regime: While the primary blame for the current phase of the crisis should go to ISIS, the al-Maliki regime enabled the violence by repressing the Sunni population -- one possible reason there was so little resistance to ISIS in the initial phases of the conflict. Without reforms in the Iraqi government that recognize the needs of all Iraqis, U.S. action would merely be propping up a sectarian government that has little prospect of ending the war. The Obama administration has acknowledged this problem, but it hasn't carried it to its logical conclusion: it makes no sense to offer military backing to the al-Maliki government as it is currently configured.4) Sending Arms Is Likely to Make Matters Worse: As happened in Mosul, weapons supplied to the Iraqi armed forces are just as likely to end up in the hands of ISIS as they are to be used against it. Even seemingly risk free actions like the Reagan administration's arming of the anti-Soviet opposition in Afghanistan can have serious unintended consequences -- in that case by bolstering anti-U.S. extremists who went on to form Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Sending arms to Iraq now could just end up increasing the military capacity of U.S. adversaries.5)  It's a Regional Problem: Most countries in the immediate region have an interest in stemming the violence. Turkey has had its diplomats in Iraq kidnapped by ISIS. Jordan and Lebanon are being strained to the limit by the need to host refugees from the war in Syria. Neither the United States, nor Iran, nor the Gulf States want to see an Al Qaeda-like group gain a permanent foothold in the area. As difficult as it may be, a regional diplomatic initiative aimed at resolving the conflict in Syria and containing ISIS is the best way forward. This time, all relevant actors, including Iran, must be at the table. The roots of the current crisis go back more than a decade, so diplomatic efforts are likely to take time. But they are far better than the alternatives.There are promising signs that the Obama administration is taking some of the above-mentioned factors into account in its deliberations over what to do in Iraq. For now, the administration is holding off on the idea of launching air strikes due to doubts about their effectiveness. And an administration official said that they are seeking a ""comprehensive strategy"" rather than a ""quick military response."" But this doesn't mean military action is entirely off the table. The option of sending special operations forces to train and support the Iraqi military appears to be gaining favor within the administration, and it would no doubt be accompanied by increased arms supplies.The ultimate shape of U.S. involvement in Iraq will depend on what the administration is hearing from the public. Just as an outpouring of opposition headed off proposals to bomb Syria, a concerted campaign to persuade the White House to avoid military intervention in Iraq could make a difference. Organizations like Win Without War, MoveOn, Women's Action for New Directions (WAND) and Peace Action are mobilizing supporters to speak out against any military moves in Iraq, and their activities could be decisive in heading off U.S. intervention.Much of the current debate over what to do in Iraq wrongly assumes that the absence of military action is synonymous with doing nothing. This is a dangerous assumption that ignores the need to develop diplomatic options. When it comes to military action, the U.S. should stay out of Iraq.William D.

Diana DeGette, D-Colo., speaks during the Colorado Democratic Party's State Assembly in Denver on Saturday, April 12, 2014.

It has recalled 20 million vehicles, mostly in the United States, of which nearly 6.5 million were recalled for ignition switch-related issues.In the emails made public on Wednesday, GM employee Laura Andres in 2005 sent one to engineers warning that a 2006 Chevy Impala Special car she was driving had experienced an engine stall when moving between a paved road and gravel.She said a technician had advised the problem may be with part of the ignition switch.""I think this is a serious safety problem, especially if this switch is on multiple programs. I'm thinking big recall,"" Andres said in an email sent to 11 other GM employees including the vice president of North American engineering.Andres declined to comment on Wednesday.The 2006 Impala was not recalled until Monday of this week, as part of an additional 3 million cars that GM recalled for an ignition-switch issue.GM in February and March recalled 2.6 million cars, including the Chevrolet Cobalt, for a separate ignition switch issue in which the car could unexpectedly stall, disabling air bags, power steering and power brakes.A GM investigation found the automaker had ignored warnings about the deadly defect for more than a decade.""This latest recall appears to follow the same disturbing pattern as the Cobalt breakdown,"" House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton said about the email exchange he revealed on Wednesday.When asked by reporters about the emails after the hearing, Barra said, ""I think the important thing is, as it relates to stalls, we consider stalls to be a safety issue. And if it is because of a defect, we're going to take action.""'FRANKLY ALARMING'Barra appeared alongside Anton Valukas, the GM-hired investigator who delivered a report earlier this month about the recall scandal that spared top executives and pinned blame on lower-level engineers and lawyers.The report said those employees either did not appreciate the danger of the flaw or did not share the risk with their superiors.Barra, who became CEO only in January but is a GM veteran of more than 30 years, has said she did not become aware of the problem until December 2013 and was not fully briefed until January of this year.""That the most senior GM executives may not have known about a defect that caused more than a dozen deaths is frankly alarming and does not absolve them of responsibility for this tragedy,"" said Democratic Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado.The company has pushed out 15 employees since the recalls were announced, including some high-ranking officials, but the departures have not affected the top level of executives.The most senior executive on the Andres email chain about the Impala was Ed Koerner, who was named vice president of North American engineering in spring 2005, before Andres sent her first email. He retired in 2009. He could not immediately be reached for comment.Another familiar name on the Andres email chain was former GM engineer Ray DeGiorgio, one of the 15 employees pushed out. The former company engineer initially approved an ignition switch design for the Cobalt that did not meet company specifications. He later approved a redesign without changing the part number, an unheard-of move in the industry. EXHAUSTIVE REVIEWLawmakers also said they are concerned that the number of recalls connected to ignition-switch issues continues to grow.GM's recalls this year include one last Friday for more than half a million Chevrolet Camaros for an ignition-switch issue that is not related to the earlier recall of Cobalts and other small cars.GM is taking recall-related charges of $2 billion so far this year. GM has not tied any fatalities to the more recent ignition-related recalls.""We are currently conducting what I believe is the most exhaustive, comprehensive safety review in the history of the company,"" Barra said on Wednesday.CHRYSLER PROBESBut lawmakers pounced on the mounting recalls as potential evidence of bigger safety problems at GM.Republican Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, chairman of the oversight subcommittee holding the hearing, said the latest ignition-related recalls are ""hauntingly similar"" to the prior recalls connected to more than 13 deaths.Separately on Wednesday, U.S. safety regulators said they have opened two investigations into Chrysler Group vehicles involving possibly faulty ignition switches that can be bumped out of the ""run"" position, disabling air bags in the event of a crash.The issue is similar to the GM recalls. No deaths or injuries are linked to the ignition-switch issue suspected in about 1.25 million vehicles covering five Chrysler models involved in the new investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency said.Chrysler is a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.COMPENSATION FUNDBarra said in her testimony on Wednesday that GM is addressing any and all safety concerns. She also said the company is committed to change.""I want this terrible experience permanently etched in our collective memories. This is a tragic problem that never should have happened. And it must never happen again.""Barra also said a compensation fund that GM is creating will cover all victims who suffered a serious physical injury, as well as families of victims who died. She said there will not be a cap on the fund.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, an outspoken critic of GM's response to the ignition issues, on Wednesday morning gathered with victims' families and called on GM to fully compensate those impacted.""All the consequences should be compensated and they should be done without the need for elaborate standards of proof or reconstruction of accidents,"" he said.GM and Barra have so far weathered the scandal with few signs of permanent damage. The automaker's May U.S. sales were up 12.6 percent from the prior year, well above analyst expectations, and its share price is slightly stronger than just before the announcement of the first ignition-related recall on Feb. 13.Also, GM on Wednesday received more awards for initial quality from J.D. Power than any other automaker in the U.S. market. (Additional reporting by Annika McGinnis in Washington; Writing by Karey Van Hall; editing by Matthew Lewis)"
