2,POLITICS,California Gives Terminally Ill Residents The Right To Die On Their Own Terms,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-assisted-suicide-right-to-die-law_us_56e2f534e4b0860f99d8cce1,It's an option for patients with no more than six months to live.,2016-03-11,The California state capitol building is seen in downtown Sacramento in this undated file photo.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586bfd291500002f00e9e338.jpeg?cache=8zJCdVUQFK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California residents with terminal illnesses will have the legal option of assisted suicide starting June 9.The state is the fifth to enact ""right to die"" legislation, which allows doctors to legally prescribe life-ending drugs at the request of patients facing imminent death. California follows Oregon, Washington, Vermont and Montana.The End of Life Option Act was actually signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) in October of last year. But because it passed the state assembly during a ""extraordinary"" legislative session, it wouldn't go into effect until 90 days after the session adjourned, as NPR reports. The session ended Thursday, March 9. Under the law, life-ending medication cannot be prescribed unless a patient has no more than six months to live, as determined by two different doctors. The patient must be mentally competent and must submit both oral and written requests to his or her attending physician at least 15 days apart. The patient must also be physically able to self-administer the drug.Among those who pushed for such legislation was Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old California woman with terminal brain cancer, who moved to Oregon to take advantage of that state's Death With Dignity Act.""I am not suicidal,"" Maynard wrote in a blog post for CNN not long before her death in late 2014. ""I do not want to die. But I am dying. And I want to die on my own terms."""
3,POLITICS,How People In San Francisco Are Saving Water,"Tara Lohan, Water Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-francisco-saving-water_us_56e31b19e4b065e2e3d5e2c4,The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission provides water to 2.6 million customers. We talked to the director of water,2016-03-11,"Water overflows from the dam at Hetch Hetchy reservoir, one of the main reservoirs in the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission's water system.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e3213a150000ad000b1c24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission provides water to 2.6 million customers. We talked to the director of water resources, Paula Kehoe, about how the agency is enabling onsite water reuse systems, drilling new groundwater wells and achieving some of the state's lowest per capita water use.San Francisco has an enviable water system. Almost completely gravity-fed, it funnels snowmelt from pristine waters high in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The water is brought to homes and businesses in San Francisco by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission(SFPUC), which also functions as a water wholesaler for the Bay Area.About 2.6 million customers receive water from the SFPUC’s system, the heart of which is the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park. Of that number, one-third are in San Francisco and the rest receive water provided by water agencies in Alameda, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.It’s a big system to run – the third largest in the state. To better understand its challenges and accomplishments (SFPUC has been a leader on conservation and water recycling, among other things), we spoke to Paula Kehoe, the SFPUC’s director of water resources.Water Deeply: How has the SFPUC been weathering the drought so far?Paula Kehoe: Our primary water source, the Hetch Hetchy reservoir has actually performed well in the drought. And that’s thanks to our storage system, which relies on a coordinated operation of all of our reservoirs. We have several reservoirs in our system, as well as a water bank account in the Don Pedro reservoir, which is downstream from Hetch Hetchy.This water bank account allows us to store water in Don Pedro reservoir during wet years for future releases to local irrigation districts during dry years. This banking system allows us to store some of our precious drinking water during dry years. During this drought, we filled or nearly filled our Hetch Hetchy reservoir every year while we were drawing down our water storage bank account.Water Deeply: It must help that San Franciscans are generally pretty low water users, right?Paula Kehoe: We are also under a state mandate. Our reduction that the state assigned to San Francisco was 8 percent. In 2013 that was a challenge for us because San Francisco already uses less water than almost anyone in the state, averaging around 45 gallons per person, per day. And that is due to our conservation program that has been in place for decades.We started off at a low residential per capita rate in response to the drought and we also asked our customers to help us through the drought and voluntarily reduce their consumption by 10 percent; we asked our irrigation customers to reduce their consumption by 25 percent and that was actually a mandate for those customers.We put in place a number of drought restrictions and we had a tremendous response here in San Francisco. We saved 14 billion gallons of water by the end of November 2015; our goal was 10 billion gallons by December 2015, so we achieved that goal even sooner than we expected. And today our residential per capita continues to decline and we’re on about 41 gallons per person per day. That is among the lowest per capita rates in the state of California.Water Deeply: Do you know how customers are saving water?Kehoe: What we plan to do [this month] is conduct a survey of San Francisco customers and consumers to find out what action they took during this drought period to really understand more about those specific actions that people took to get us down to 41 gallons per person per day.And then we want to ask them if they will continue these actions and behavioral practices in the future. So we will have a better understanding of how sustainable our 41 gallons per capita is and if will we see any rebound in that. Historically, in previous droughts, we’ve seen the per capita went down and there was a slight rebound but it never went back to the consumption rates we saw prior to drought periods.We are happy that we live in a community where people are responding and really helping us manage our way through the drought.Water Deeply: What’s your biggest focus right now?Kehoe: We are working hard on many different levels. We have a local water program here that is geared toward continuing our conservation efforts as well as developing new water supplies in San Francisco. That really provides us with additional flexibility to meet our diverse water needs by using the right type of water for the right use here in the city.With our conservation program, it’s been our focus for decades; since the early 1990s we have provided incentives to replace 80,000 toilets and 30,000 clothes washers, and conducted over 100,000 water audits – that really has paid off as our per capita has gone down but population has increased.Really, we have seen an over 20 percent decrease in water consumption in 10 years despite modest population growth. We also have been doing studies to see how many inefficient fixtures are still left in San Francisco in homes and businesses. We completed that study and found that really our conservation programs have been so effective that we believe that 70 percent of all the toilets are water efficient. At least 50-60 percent of all residential clothes washers are efficient.But that doesn’t mean our job is done.Water Deeply: How are you working to expand the water supply?Kehoe: Currently we are installing new wells in San Francisco. We will have six groundwater wells in the city and we will pump that and blend it with our surface supply, which will be available day in and day out. We will be able to produce approximately 4 million gallons a day and that will increase our water supply here in San Francisco.Our other focus is continuing to look at future droughts. We anticipate that we will have more droughts, so we are actively working on a project south of San Francisco by installing 13 groundwater wells to produce an additional 7 million gallons of water for drought purposes only.Water Deeply: You’ve also done a lot with water recycling, how is that going?Kehoe: We know the best investment for recycled water here for us in San Francisco is to address large-scale irrigation such as parks and golf courses. Harding Park and Fleming Park golf courses currently use recycled water for their irrigation and later this year we plan to start construction on a recycled water plant on the west side of San Francisco to irrigate Golden Gate Park, Lincoln Park golf course and portions of the Presidio. That’s another big focus to get that plant up and going.We are also using non-potable water to clean our streets in San Francisco.When it came to building our new headquarters we incorporated our own onsite water treatment system and rainwater harvesting system as well as the living machine that enables us to save 65 percent of potable water that we’d otherwise be using to flush our toilets and urinals.We came across a number of other developers who wanted onsite water treatment in their buildings and districts in San Francisco so we created a non-potable water program to allow that. The creation of that program really allowed us to align our governmental policies to create a process for private owners to install these systems.And today we have over 40 buildings that are proposing to collect and treat their own water on site and to use that for non-potable applications such as for toilet flushing and irrigation. We’ve been learning and working with others throughout the country to show that you can successfully integrate decentralized onsite water treatment systems into your broader, centralized infrastructure to reduce the use of potable water.Water Deeply: Are there any policy changes that you think would help?Kehoe: Most water issues are local. We all have different water systems. We all have different sources of water, different demands, different growth rates. Most folks are also working on developing their own local water supplies for local control and that’s what San Francisco is doing and many others throughout California.I think what’s helpful to us is grant funding, financial assistance, state revolving fund loans that have low interest rates. Those are helpful tools to provide to the utilities who know their water systems best, know their communities best, to help them implement these kinds of projects.Water Deeply: You recently helped to fund a report, ""Managing Drought: Learning from Australia,"" about drought lessons in Australia. Why did you get involved in that project?Kehoe: We were excited about that because we wanted to learn what worked and didn’t work in Australia. If there were things we could apply here. I think one of the major conclusions of the study is that conservation and demand management programs are very key to dealing with drought and to be doing those programs all along in advance. That has been San Francisco’s experience. We’ve been doing it for decades. It’s helped us through this drought.Water Deeply: A lot of water agencies are having revenue problems because residents are conserving water so well – has that been an issue for you?Kehoe: Yes, that’s the downside of folks responding to our call. Our call was to our customers and consumers to help us through this drought and they did a great job and helped us. The unfortunate part is that it does impact our revenue and that is a situation that we are dealing with and are addressing. We’ve had to take some actions here. We’ve had 5 percent cuts throughout the agency. We’ve had to limit certain activities and things we are doing.We are looking at different kinds of options, possibly revisiting our rates, although they are approved through 2017.Water Deeply: Anything else you’d like readers to know?Kehoe: I think that we’re all in this together. There is the role of the utility – we are developing recycled water and new groundwater projects. There is a role for consumers and customers to take on changing out their toilets and clothes washers and having efficient fixtures to help us respond to drought. There is a role for business with non-potable water programs. Developers are installing these systems. I think it’s a collective and we’re all working together and toward the same goal.Our work is never done and that’s a good thing. We are in a very uncertain time when it comes to climate and we want to be prepared for the future.This article originally appeared on Water Deeply.

That is among the lowest per capita rates in the state of California.Water Deeply: Do you know how customers are saving water?Kehoe: What we plan to do [this month] is conduct a survey of San Francisco customers and consumers to find out what action they took during this drought period to really understand more about those specific actions that people took to get us down to 41 gallons per person per day.And then we want to ask them if they will continue these actions and behavioral practices in the future. So we will have a better understanding of how sustainable our 41 gallons per capita is and if will we see any rebound in that. Historically, in previous droughts, we’ve seen the per capita went down and there was a slight rebound but it never went back to the consumption rates we saw prior to drought periods.We are happy that we live in a community where people are responding and really helping us manage our way through the drought.Water Deeply: What’s your biggest focus right now?Kehoe: We are working hard on many different levels. We have a local water program here that is geared toward continuing our conservation efforts as well as developing new water supplies in San Francisco. That really provides us with additional flexibility to meet our diverse water needs by using the right type of water for the right use here in the city.With our conservation program, it’s been our focus for decades; since the early 1990s we have provided incentives to replace 80,000 toilets and 30,000 clothes washers, and conducted over 100,000 water audits – that really has paid off as our per capita has gone down but population has increased.Really, we have seen an over 20 percent decrease in water consumption in 10 years despite modest population growth. We also have been doing studies to see how many inefficient fixtures are still left in San Francisco in homes and businesses. We completed that study and found that really our conservation programs have been so effective that we believe that 70 percent of all the toilets are water efficient. At least 50-60 percent of all residential clothes washers are efficient.But that doesn’t mean our job is done.Water Deeply: How are you working to expand the water supply?Kehoe: Currently we are installing new wells in San Francisco. We will have six groundwater wells in the city and we will pump that and blend it with our surface supply, which will be available day in and day out. We will be able to produce approximately 4 million gallons a day and that will increase our water supply here in San Francisco.Our other focus is continuing to look at future droughts. We anticipate that we will have more droughts, so we are actively working on a project south of San Francisco by installing 13 groundwater wells to produce an additional 7 million gallons of water for drought purposes only.Water Deeply: You’ve also done a lot with water recycling, how is that going?Kehoe: We know the best investment for recycled water here for us in San Francisco is to address large-scale irrigation such as parks and golf courses. Harding Park and Fleming Park golf courses currently use recycled water for their irrigation and later this year we plan to start construction on a recycled water plant on the west side of San Francisco to irrigate Golden Gate Park, Lincoln Park golf course and portions of the Presidio. That’s another big focus to get that plant up and going.We are also using non-potable water to clean our streets in San Francisco.When it came to building our new headquarters we incorporated our own onsite water treatment system and rainwater harvesting system as well as the living machine that enables us to save 65 percent of potable water that we’d otherwise be using to flush our toilets and urinals.We came across a number of other developers who wanted onsite water treatment in their buildings and districts in San Francisco so we created a non-potable water program to allow that. The creation of that program really allowed us to align our governmental policies to create a process for private owners to install these systems.And today we have over 40 buildings that are proposing to collect and treat their own water on site and to use that for non-potable applications such as for toilet flushing and irrigation. We’ve been learning and working with others throughout the country to show that you can successfully integrate decentralized onsite water treatment systems into your broader, centralized infrastructure to reduce the use of potable water.Water Deeply: Are there any policy changes that you think would help?Kehoe: Most water issues are local. We all have different water systems. We all have different sources of water, different demands, different growth rates. Most folks are also working on developing their own local water supplies for local control and that’s what San Francisco is doing and many others throughout California.I think what’s helpful to us is grant funding, financial assistance, state revolving fund loans that have low interest rates. Those are helpful tools to provide to the utilities who know their water systems best, know their communities best, to help them implement these kinds of projects.Water Deeply: You recently helped to fund a report, ""Managing Drought: Learning from Australia,"" about drought lessons in Australia. Why did you get involved in that project?Kehoe: We were excited about that because we wanted to learn what worked and didn’t work in Australia. If there were things we could apply here. I think one of the major conclusions of the study is that conservation and demand management programs are very key to dealing with drought and to be doing those programs all along in advance. That has been San Francisco’s experience. We’ve been doing it for decades. It’s helped us through this drought.Water Deeply: A lot of water agencies are having revenue problems because residents are conserving water so well – has that been an issue for you?Kehoe: Yes, that’s the downside of folks responding to our call. Our call was to our customers and consumers to help us through this drought and they did a great job and helped us. The unfortunate part is that it does impact our revenue and that is a situation that we are dealing with and are addressing. We’ve had to take some actions here. We’ve had 5 percent cuts throughout the agency. We’ve had to limit certain activities and things we are doing.We are looking at different kinds of options, possibly revisiting our rates, although they are approved through 2017.Water Deeply: Anything else you’d like readers to know?Kehoe: I think that we’re all in this together. There is the role of the utility – we are developing recycled water and new groundwater projects. There is a role for consumers and customers to take on changing out their toilets and clothes washers and having efficient fixtures to help us respond to drought. There is a role for business with non-potable water programs. Developers are installing these systems. I think it’s a collective and we’re all working together and toward the same goal.Our work is never done and that’s a good thing. We are in a very uncertain time when it comes to climate and we want to be prepared for the future.This article originally appeared on Water Deeply.

Maneka Gandhi, the country's union minister for women and child development, said she did not believe marital rape could be enforced in India. ""It is considered that the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors like level of education/illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, mindset of the society to treat the marriage as a sacrament etc,"" she said Thursday in a written statement. Parliament issued a similar statement after considering the issue last year. Any intercourse between a man and his wife, regardless of consent, is currently considered legal in India, as long as the wife is over the age of 15. The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 states that married citizens must have sex if their partner requests it, and is typically invoked when men want to divorce their wives for withholding sex. As recently as 2012, women denying their husbands sex has been referred to as an act of ""cruelty.""A panel of lawmakers told the Indian Parliament in 2013 that any movement to make marital rape illegal had ""the potential of destroying the institution of marriage.""The number women in India who are sexually assaulted by their husbands is 40 times larger than the number of women sexually assaulted by others, according to a report published last year by the Rice Institute, which studies health and well-being in India. Considering that an estimated 93 women are raped in India every day, the number of women who are assaulted by their husbands must be very high.""Marital rape is an extremely widespread problem,"" Mihira Sood, a Delhi-based attorney who specializes in women’s rights, told The Huffington Post in November, adding that there are few resources for women seeking justice after being attacked.""[It’s] compounded by the fact that it is not recognized as an offense, either by the law as well as by much of society that is conditioned to see it as an inevitable part of marriage,"" Sood said.

But this rainbow doesn't actually make contact with the Earth.Instead, it forms a mesmerizing 360-degree ring that looks like it's floating inches above the land. Martin McKenna captured the spectacular sight over Cookstown in Northern Ireland on Monday with a smartphone attached to a drone.""It was all grey skies and pouring rain, completely miserable. (But) the clouds parted, the sun came out and this rainbow came over the trees,"" he told the Belfast Telegraph.""As it rose higher, there was a transition from a rainbow into a complete circle,"" McKenna added. ""It's impossible to see from ground level. It was just unbelievable. I'm still buzzing from it.""A rainbow in its total form never truly ends. ""Our ground-based vantage prevents us from seeing the full, colorful circle of refracted light. But when you're high enough in the sky, and when the light is just right a full rainbow is a sight to behold,"" The Washington Post reports.You'd have to be in a skyscraper or plane to witness the spectacle of a 360-degree rainbow, and the sun's height rules how much of the circle is visible. But they are not actually rare.NASA explained the phenomenon best when it chose Colin Leonhardt's image (above) of a 360-degree rainbow taken from a helicopter flying over Cottesloe Beach in Perth, Western Australia, as its Astronomy Picture of the Day in October 2014.""From the ground, typically, only the top portion of a rainbow is visible because directions toward the ground have fewer raindrops.

Earlier this week, the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara broke the news to Graham's mother, Constance Malcolm, that there would be no federal civil rights charges in her son's 2012 death. But Malcolm says Bharara also told her that neither his office, nor anyone else at the Department of Justice, ever told the NYPD to postpone its Internal Affairs investigation into the fatal police shooting of Graham, nor to hold off on disciplining the officers involved. That directly contradicts statements given by Bratton to New York City Council's Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus in January. City council members Andy King, Robert Cornegy and Vanessa Gibson, among others, said the commissioner told them the DOJ had made such a request. Malcolm and Graham's father, Frank Graham, met with Bharara on Tuesday. Also present at the meeting were Yul-San Liem and Loyda Colon, members of the advocacy group Justice Committee, and Joo-Hyun Kang, director of Communities United for Police Reform. All have confirmed that Bharara said in the meeting that his office never told Bratton or the NYPD to hold off on its Internal Affairs investigation. ""We now know that was a big lie that Bratton told,"" Malcolm said Thursday at a press conference outside City Hall in lower Manhattan.""I was in the meeting with the DOJ,"" Colon said. ""They had no idea what we were talking about, saying they never said that to Bratton. There's a lot of press out here today and we hope that you contact Bratton and ask him, ask him why he lied, why he lied to elected officials, why he lied to Ramarley Graham's family, why he lied to New Yorkers."" Peter Donald, the NYPD director of communications, told The Huffington Post that if Bratton said the DOJ made the request, then the DOJ made the request. Donald said that when the DOJ investigates an incident involving NYPD officers, it's ""standard policy"" to delay its own Internal Affairs investigation, as to not interfere.""As long as anyone here [at the NYPD] can remember, this is the way it was done,"" Donald said.But when pressed about the case of former NYPD Officer Francis Livoti -- who the NYPD fired in 1997 before the conclusion of a DOJ investigation into the death of Anthony Baez -- Donald demurred. That was ""20 years ago,"" he said of the Livoti case.And asked if there's a written policy stipulating the postponement of an Internal Affairs probe until the conclusion of a DOJ investigation, Donald said he'd have to check. Donald added that the department will now ""move expeditiously"" in its investigation into Graham's death. Twenty-four New York City Council members Thursday sent Bratton a letter asking him to fire the officers involved in Graham's death. At least one of those City Council members, Inez Barron, said that if Bratton's alleged lie can be ""documented,"" then he ""needs to be fired.""A spokesman for Bharara, the U.S. attorney, declined to comment on the matter, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice declined to talk to HuffPost.Dr. Maki Haberfeld, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, previously told HuffPost she was ""surprised"" to hear that the NYPD hasn't already wrapped up an Internal Affairs investigation into Graham's death. ""Four years is not a normal amount of time,"" she said.While the Justice Department does sometimes ask a police department to hold off on an investigation, Haberfeld added, such requests are ""uncommon."" In the meantime, the officer who shot Graham in 2012, Richard Haste, has continued working at the NYPD on ""modified duty,"" earning $25,000 in raises over the last four years, a fact first reported by HuffPost.""After four years, there has been no justice or accountability -- NYPD officers murdered our son in his home,"" Graham's parents said in a joint statement Thursday. ""He was doing nothing wrong, he should have been safe at home. NYPD busted in without a warrant and then abused and intimidated members of our family while releasing misleading and inaccurate information about the killing.""""The criminal justice system on the local and federal levels have failed to demonstrate a commitment to valuing and protecting Black lives,"" the parents continued. ""Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bratton are part of this injustice and devaluing of Ramarley's life as long as they allow these officers to continue receiving paychecks as NYPD employees."" On Feb. 2, 2012, the NYPD says a narcotics unit spotted Graham “adjust his waistband” outside a Bronx convenience store and took that to mean the 18-year-old had a gun.The NYPD claims that Graham ran when officers approached him. But surveillance footage seems to contradict that claim. Graham can be seen in the video calmly walking up to his mother’s apartment building and going inside.Moments later, Haste and one other officer run up to the building, guns drawn, and attempt to kick down the door. After about five minutes, the officers managed to get inside the building and knock down the door to Graham's apartment.Haste confronted Graham in the bathroom, where the NYPD says the teen was trying to flush a bag of marijuana. He allegedly reached for his waistband during the confrontation, which prompted Haste to pull the trigger. A single bullet hit Graham in the chest, killing him. His grandmother, Patricia Hartley, and his 6-year-old brother, Chinnor Campbell, were home at the time and witnessed the shooting. In 2012, a grand jury voted to indict Haste, but the case was tossed out because of a prosecutorial mistake. Another grand jury later declined to indict Haste. Although Haste testified to both grand juries about the shooting, those testimonies are sealed and have never been shown to the public. The family settled its lawsuit in January for $3.9 million, thus precluding the NYPD from publicly defending Haste's actions in court."

According to the student paper, that body decided to expel Montague in February, and refused to hear an appeal.Montague, who helped lead Yale toward its first NCAA Tournament berth since 1962, last appeared in a game for the Bulldogs basketball team on Feb. 6. On Feb. 10, his student status was changed to ""withdrawn."" The school's athletic office confirmed in late February that Montague would not return to the team; Montague's father told the New Haven Register that he had been expelled.“We have strict orders from our lawyers,” Jim Montague told the Register. “Soon enough, I’d love to tell the other side of the story. It’s ridiculous, why he’s expelled. It’s probably going to set some sort of precedent. We’re trying to do things the gentleman’s way, so we’re keeping things close-knit. But you guys will get a story.”Rumors have swirled around campus that a Yale student had filed a sexual assault complaint against Montague, particularly after posters appeared in campus buildings urging the men's basketball team to ""Stop supporting a rapist."" The posters followed the basketball team's Feb. 26 game against Harvard, when multiple Yale players donned tributes to their absent captain during pre-game warm-ups.There were no police reports filed around the incident with either the New Haven or Yale police departments, according to previous reports.Instead, it's possible that the incident was dealt with entirely within the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, which handles Title IX sexual assault and misconduct complaints involving Yale students. In an email to The Huffington Post, a Yale spokesperson declined to confirm the reports, citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to say that ""Information pertaining to a student’s withdrawal from the university is maintained as part of the student’s confidential educational record."""

21,TECH,Cola Messenger Is Like Text Messaging On Steroids,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cola-messenger_us_56e1840ce4b065e2e3d4e780,Because who uses their smartphone to make calls?,2016-03-10,"In this case, both people are in the same building already, so their identifying bubbles appear right on top of one another. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e19fb61e00008700703b48.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Text messaging is a more popular way to communicate on smartphones than standard voice calls. Last year, 97 percent of American smartphone owners said they use their device to text, compared to 93 percent who use it to make voice or video calls, per a report from the Pew Research Center.Cola Messenger, a new iOS app that launched on Thursday, gets this. Its aim is to introduce a slew of convenient features to the texting experience, transforming how you're able to communicate without, you know, having to call anyone.""The devices we call 'phones' are, in reality, messaging devices,"" David Temkin, Cola Messenger's CEO, told The Huffington Post. Here's how the app works: When you're in a text conversation with an individual or group, you can use functions like ""When Can We Meet?"" ""Where Are You Now?"" and ""Quick Poll"" to generate an interactive experience for your contacts.For example, If you're trying to set up a movie date, use the ""When Can We Meet?"" function, and anyone involved in your conversation will be able to select a time that works for them. When you send the invitation, you'll be able to mark up to five times that work for you, to give your friends options.If you send a ""Where Are You Now?"" message, the recipient will be able to share their location for a certain amount of time, basically giving you permission to track them for, say, 30 minutes. You won't get notifications about their movements, but you'll be able to pull up the map at will and see where your contacts are. That'll help if you're freaking out about missing a reservation or what have you.Here's what that feature looks like:All this is neat but kind of useless if everyone has to download Cola Messenger -- because even if you do, there's no guarantee your friends will. Fortunately, they don't have to.If you send a Cola message to somebody who doesn't have the app, they'll receive it like a normal text message with a short URL that will take them to an external website, where they'll be able to interact with Cola functions.For example, we tried to send a Cola message to an Android user, since the app is currently iOS only. It wasn't super elegant, but this is what happened:The Android user was able to click the link and share his location. While the original Cola Messenger user wasn't notified when the new location was added, the map did update -- so it basically worked as promised.Temkin said his team wanted to ""make it possible for someone to see the value in the product without asking them to download the app.""Note that you'll want to be a little careful about sharing your location in this way. As mentioned, you have to tap on a URL to share this data if you're not using the app. In theory, you could copy and paste that URL to anyone, and they would be able to track you and your friends via any web browser.That seems a little paranoid, but just remember that you shouldn't share any information with people you don't trust. If you're very anxious about having this type of data online, don't share it, period.Cola's limited right now, but there's more coming. In the near future, Cola Messenger will open up its software development kit, so others will be able to create new functionalities. And Temkin said an Android version is coming soon.To be clear, this isn't the only messaging app out there with cool interactive features. There are plenty of competitors. But it's got a pretty serious pedigree: Temkin came from AOL and, before that, Apple, where he worked on the Newton. Other members of the Cola team helped develop the iPhone and Adobe Photoshop.You can check out Cola Messenger on iTunes now.AOL is The Huffington Post's parent company.

That seems to be the Republican playbook these days for fending off local minimum wage hikes.Following in the footsteps of other states, the GOP-controlled Idaho state Senate passed a bill Thursday that would bar local jurisdictions from raising the minimum wage on their own. The measure was already passed by the GOP-controlled house and will now head to the desk of Republican Gov. Butch Otter. A spokesman for Otter said that the governor hadn't yet received the legislation, and that he wouldn't comment on it until he decided what kind of action he would take.If Otter doesn't veto it, Idaho will become the 19th state in the U.S. to enact what's now known as a minimum wage ""pre-emption"" law, according to the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. Several of those laws have been on the books since the 1990s, but a rash of them have only recently been passed as local minimum wage hikes have become more popular. In lieu of federal or state action, more and more cities and counties are deciding to raise the wage floors all on their own, either through local legislation or ballot initiatives. Business groups and mostly Republican lawmakers, in turn, have looked to pre-emption laws in order to thwart those raises.The state of Alabama drew national attention last month when Republican lawmakers in Montgomery passed a controversial pre-emption bill. The law was clearly aimed at the city of Birmingham, where local Democratic lawmakers passed a measure raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. The law in Birmingham -- where 73 percent of residents are African-American and 30 percent live below the federal poverty line -- was effectively superseded and killed by legislators in the state Capitol. The Alabama measure came on the heels of similar ones in Oklahoma, Michigan and Rhode Island. (The latter passed with the support of Democrats.)Backers of the pre-emption laws -- including Idaho state Sen. Jim Rice, sponsor of the senate measure -- say they want to avoid a patchwork of different minimum wages across a given state, which they say could be confusing for business owners. But the practical effect in many states is to block any minimum wage raises at all. The state of Alabama does not have its own minimum wage, so the federal rate of $7.25 sets the floor. The state minimum wage in Idaho is $7.25 as well.According to Boise Weekly, the only Idaho city that has held a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage was the resort town of McCall. The proposal last year would have hiked the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.25 over the course of two years. It was narrowly voted down, 53 percent to 47 percent. "
23,POLITICS,"Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders 'Promise' They Won’t Deport Children, Adults Without Criminal Records",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-debate-deporting-children_us_56e0e3ebe4b065e2e3d4d907,Advocates got a major weapon in their fight against deportations in the next administration (unless it's Trump).,2016-03-10,"Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders stand together before the start of the Univision, Washington Post Democratic presidential debate at Miami-Dade College, Wednesday, March 9, 2016, in Miami.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During Wednesday's Democratic debate in Miami, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) both promised not to deport children or non-criminal undocumented immigrants, and criticized President Barack Obama for doing so.""I do not have the same policy as the current administration does,"" Clinton said. She added the U.S. should ""stop the raids.""""I will not deport deport children. I would not deport children,"" Clinton said later. ""I do not want to deport family members either.""Both are in a tough spot on the issue of deporting children. Univision moderator Jorge Ramos challenged them repeatedly on whether they would send home children apprehended at the border. Ramos brought up Clinton's statement in 2014 that unaccompanied minors -- who at the time were being apprehended in surging numbers -- ""should be sent back"" to their native countries. Clinton said she only meant that that the nation's asylum should be followed, while adding that the laws themselves should be liberalized.Clinton quickly pivoted back to saying undocumented people ""living in our country"" should be given a path to citizenship.It could be tough to square the two statements, however. Discussions about children being deported are almost exclusively around the unaccompanied minors crossing the border -- not necessarily people already living in the country. Following current asylum laws means that if the children are rejected for relief, they can be deported. If a president promises not to deport children -- any of them -- as a blanket matter, that would be blown up.Sanders hit Clinton for her comments, and made promises of his own. He said Obama ""is wrong on this issue of deportation.""""I will not deport children from the United States of America,"" Sanders said, adding that he also ""can make that promise"" that he won't deport non-criminal undocumented immigrants.Obama has never made such a blanket promise, but rather he has repeatedly said his administration will focus enforcement on violent criminals and national security threats. Although the rate of deportations in general has gone down from record highs in the early years of his presidency, it's not enough to prevent every family from being ripped apart or to allow every person who asks for asylum in the U.S. to stay.  If either Clinton or Sanders becomes president, the pledges will be difficult to keep, but the marker has been laid down, and advocates will be able to hold a future administration accountable. "

It's part of her job as the campaign director for Shoulder to Shoulder, an interfaith coalition made up of over 20 national religious organizations. The group brings together religious groups that differ widely on theology-- everyone from the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America -- but who are all eager to present a solid front against rising levels of anti-Muslim sentiment in America.Orsborn, 31, told The Huffington Post that she didn't have much exposure to Islam growing up in the Bible Belt. Her family was part of a small conservative Christian denomination that focused on international missions work. She went to Christian schools as a child and as a college student. There may have been Muslims in her home town of Lexington, Kentucky, but their paths never crossed. It was only when she signed up to study abroad in Cairo, Egypt, during her last year of college, that she got a chance to develop meaningful relationships with Muslims. ""[In Egypt,] I started having really interesting theological conversations with a Muslim friend my age and realizing that the way she held on to her faith felt very familiar to me,"" Orsborn told The Huffington Post. ""I felt like it was a mirror of myself, but with a different tradition.""The trip shattered her preconceived notion about a monolithic Muslim world. But coming back from Egypt, Orsborn found that those stereotypes were still very much alive in her evangelical Christian community. Studies have shown that knowing someone from a religious group is linked with having more positive views of that group. Yet the American Muslim community is so small (just about 1 percent of the total U.S. population), that unless people are willing to search for these experiences, like Orsborn did, they may never end up in the same social circles as Muslims.That's where allies come in -- non-Muslims who are willing to walk alongside Muslims, take a stand against Islamophibic rhetoric and spread this message to other members of their social groups. HuffPost Religion spoke with Orsborn for her advice on how to be a good ally for Muslim Americans. Read on for her tips below.HuffPost Religion: When you hear the word ""ally"" what kind of feeling does it evoke in you? What does the word mean to you?Catherine Orsborn: For me, to be an ally is to to come alongside people who are experiencing this stuff the most personally and the most negatively and trying to listen to them about it... I think 'ally' conjures up this feeling that you can opt in. And surely, I think people can opt in to be more fully engaged, but the people who ignore it will feel it eventually because [Islamophobia] is eroding the pluralistic nature of our country... It's something we all genuinely have a stake in as Americans and as people of faith. What are the responsibilities or personality traits of a good ally?I think that there are two really important qualities that I think sometimes people wanting to be good allies miss at the beginning. And that's the values of listening and having a sense of humility. You're not coming in as the 'savior' of whatever group you're walking beside and you don't know everything. You can't assume what that experience is like. So I think one of the first steps in being an ally is taking the time to expose yourself to various voices from the Muslim community. Some people may not be able to do that in person, so they may need to be reading blogs or op-eds or following a variety of people on Twitter. But be listening to the priorities, concerns, feelings and experiences of the community. And be aware that there is more than one Muslim voice because American Muslim communities are often very diverse. I think humility goes hand in hand with being a good listener. It's about not speaking for, but coming alongside. In your experience, what is the most effective way to change an Islamophobic person's mind?In terms of one-on-one conversations, I've found that immediately trying to push out facts that counter the facts the other person are sharing makes people dig in their heels about it more. There's a Socratic method to it, of asking questions and trying to make people feel listened to or heard, that the fears that they're feeling about family or country are not being dismissed ... Then, you find that they're open to conversations where you can ask, 'Where are you getting your information from, or how would you feel if the information everyone had about you came from news sources interested in making you look bad?' Establish a safe space for people and help them to see that Muslims are also concerned about their security, that they also feel the insecurity that they fear. Muslims living in the country have the same fears right now about themselves and about their children.What can ordinary people do?I think anybody can start the work of trying to listen and seek out voices from the Muslim community and help amplify those. Sometimes we make the interfaith relationship building space too complicated. We think we need to form interfaith councils and have a perfectly structured event. I think just getting a few people together to have a play group with your kids or coffee hour or book groups, that works well, too. You don't always have to have a structured conversation, or even talk about religion at all. You could get together and do something normal ... Little steps are valuable, too. What gives you hope and keeps you motivated about fighting Islamophobia, even in this very turbulent political climate?Every time there is an upsurge of anti-Muslim rhetoric, I hear from tons of concerned people who want to know how to plug in and what they can do ... Because I come from a more conservative Christian evangelical community, I can say that I've seen a lot more interest [from them] on engaging on this issue ... Conservatives Christians broadly, they don't want to be seen as the haters. I think there's this push towards being seen as people who are loving and that has really been encouraging.There's also a lot of collaboration among people who don't want any group in our society to be discriminated against. I'm seeing different groups with different issue areas working together and seeing that the issues are interconnected to one another. It's not a zero sum game of a particular group getting more rights and somehow curtailing the rights of another group. We're all fighting for equal rights and equal dignity. When I see that collaboration happening, it's overwhelming but it's also exciting that people see their destines are connected. This interview has been edited for clarity and length."

Daulerio, the former editor of Gawker, listens as Terry Bollea, aka Hulk Hogan, testifies in court during his trial against Gawker Media at the Pinellas County Courthouse on March 8, 2016 in St Petersburg, Florida",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5861852b1900002a000e1a39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A former Gawker editor flippantly explained on the third day of testimony in Hulk Hogan's lawsuit that he had a low bar for publishing graphic images and would even be willing to publish celebrity sex tapes of children.Gawker Media was sued by the former pro wrestler, whose real name is Terry Bollea, for allegedly invading his privacy when in 2012 it published video footage of him having sex with the wife of a former friend. Bollea is seeking $100 million for the unwanted exposure. Gawker has said the explicit content, recorded without Bollea's knowledge and provided by an anonymous source, was ""newsworthy.""On Wednesday, jurors heard more about what constituted newsworthy material at Gawker under former Editor-in-Chief A.J. Daulerio.At first, Daulerio said he would refrain from publishing graphic material of people ""if they were a child,"" according to The Guardian. When pressed by Bollea's attorney for an age limit, Daulerio said, ""Four.""""No 4-year-old sex tapes. OK,"" the lawyer said, according to The New York Daily News. The back-and-forth came from a pre-recorded deposition shown in the St. Petersburg, Florida, courtroom.To be fair, Daulerio's comments about hypothetical sex tapes of young children sounded insincere. According to the New York Post, a spokesman for Gawker later noted, ""He'd just said in the prior answer that he wouldn't post a tape of a child, and when the question was repeated, he obviously made the point in a flip way because his answer was already clear.""Still, the whole exchange underlined how Gawker built its reputation -- with a take-no-prisoners approach to news. For years, the company fed readers hungry for salacious details about the lives of celebrities and other public figures.Gawker courted controversy by showing little restraint in its coverage and crossed even its own boundaries last year by outing a media executive who allegedly solicited a male escort. In November, Gawker Media announced a shakeup as the company put its focus on politics over gossip.During Daulerio's tenure, however, the guidelines were different. His testimony showed that. In one deposition from 2013, he was asked why he published the X-rated video. ""Because I found it very amusing,"" Daulerio said, according to CNN.Gawker founder Nick Denton, in another deposition shown in court, said that he believed in ""total freedom and information transparency"" and that he was ""proud of our piece.""Denton and Daulerio are co-defendants with Gawker Media in the lawsuit. Their testimony came a day after Bollea took the stand and tried to differentiate between his swaggering public persona, which has exaggerated his sexual exploits, and his private life. which he said he should be able to shield from view. Gawker has argued that the sex tape was fair game because Bollea discussed aspects of his personal life on reality television and in interviews. But in October, Gawker Media President Heather Dietrick told staff that she expected to lose the lawsuit. The story has been updated with comment from a Gawker spokesman."

We’ve bumped into each other and we’ve hung out and stuff, but the thing is if I hang out with someone, it’s instantly like I’m 'dating' them. We were never in a relationship.

(Though we know there are plenty of other tattooed men in the world who'd probably want Goulding's heart.)And speaking of Goulding's lyrics, the singer also told Seventeen, ""I want to write lyrics that girls can relate to.

According to a Wikimedia blog post this week, the initiative helped more than 370 women scientists appear on Wikipedia’s front page “Did you know?” section. Siko Bouterse, a former Wikimedia Foundation staff member, said Temple-Wood’s impact on the online encyclopedia's gender gap has been “epic.” “She’s created hundreds of articles about women scientists, including articles that address multiple gaps in Wikipedia -- it’s really important that she’s not just writing about white women scientists, she’s also working to address underrepresentation of women of color in Wikipedia and looking at other points of intersectionality as well. And perhaps most importantly, because we’re much stronger collectively than alone, Emily has taught and inspired others to do the same,” said Bouterse on the blog. Temple-Wood, who will be heading to medical school in the fall, has “thank[ed] her harassers for helping to fight against systemic bias on Wikipedia.” Due to their horrible emails, she already has a backlog of articles to work on.Other Wikipedians are reportedly following in her footsteps, using this sort of “positive punishment” to fight inequality. “When I was a kid, I could count the number of women scientists I was aware of on one hand.

But about a third of endocrinologists are unwilling to care for patients who are transgender, and less than half say they feel at least somewhat competent in providing that care, said Dr. Michael Irwig, who surveyed the doctors at an endocrinology meeting last year.""There is still a big access problem,"" said Irwig, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. ""The fact that 30 percent won't see transgender patients wouldn’t happen with any other diagnosis.""""Basically, nobody had really done a similar survey before,"" said Irwig, who is also director of the Andrology Center at GW Medical Faculty Associates.He asked 80 endocrinology providers from Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. to answer a 19-item survey. About 80 percent answered the survey.Overall, 15 percent said they were not at all comfortable discussing gender identity, and another 34 percent said they were only slightly comfortable discussing the subject, according to the study online now in Endocrine Practice.Fifty-eight percent reported being less comfortable with transgender patients than with non-transgender patients.Fellowship training on transgender care was uncommon, reported by less than one-third of the doctors overall and by 58 percent of those ages 25 to 39.Only 41 percent of participants felt at least somewhat competent in providing care to transgender people.And only 63 percent said transgender patients could be seen at their practice. Irwig said he asked participants to explain why such patients couldn't be seen, ""but a lot of them didn’t fill in that open-ended question.""He told Reuters Health there could be a number of reasons for doctors refusing to see transgender patients, including prejudice, lack of understanding and not feeling competent in providing the needed care.More training and experience may help improve healthcare access, said Irwig.The Endocrine Society is updating its 2009 guidelines for caring for people who are transgender. The guidelines provide guidance and legitimacy, said Dr. Josh Safer, who is working on the update.""The guidelines are an evidence-based, thoughtful approach from the ultimate mainstream endocrinology professional society and that is very strong for those needing reliable sources,"" said Safer, of the Boston University School of Medicine, in an email to Reuters Health.The updated guidelines include changes to terminology, new practices on how to care for transgender adolescents and how transgender care fits within the larger medical community, he added in a phone interview.Irwig said transgender people likely know healthcare access is an issue. To find endocrinologists who can provide culturally competent care, he suggests that patients calling doctors' offices ""ask their staff how many transgender patients are seen in the practice, because that will give them a good idea.""Safer said he considers it a priority to train endocrinologists in transgender medical care.

The lines, the crowds, the cast of characters. But a look at what flying was like some 90 years ago might just put all of that into perspective.This image from Lufthansa's archives shows one of the airlines' plane cabins in 1926. The only thing that appears less sturdy than the Dornier Merkur aircraft itself is set of wicker chairs meant for passengers.Here's a look at a similar cabin design, most likely shot in 1924, according to Getty Images. According to helicopter and rotorcraft directory Aviastar, variations of the Dornier Komet featured one propeller and four to six seats for passengers, plus an open cockpit for the pilot (the Komet III included a second seat in the cockpit for the mechanic).According to us, it also featured our nightmares.Kind of makes those crowds of today seem a bit more bearable, no?"

When Crawford approached a witness to advise them on their rights, a verbal altercation began between Crawford and the DA's investigator, Crawford's attorney told The Huffington Post.Crawford's attorney, Jerry Steering, says the DA's investigator continued to interfere with Crawford's attempts to advise his client. Crawford repeatedly asked the investigator to back down, and the altercation escalated, Steering said, when Crawford mentioned the allegations of misconduct stemming from the county's jailhouse informant program.Steering said the DA's investigator ""lost it,"" rushed Crawford and began ""bashing his brains out"" on a bench in the hallway and ""punching his lights out.""After he delivered several blows to Crawford's head, Santa Ana Police officers finally pulled the investigator off of Crawford.Steering says he intends to file a civil lawsuit over the attack. On Wednesday, the DA's office would not comment on any specifics about the attack, but said that they are ""fully cooperating"" with the Orange County Sheriff's Department as it investigates the ""incident that took place."" OCSD confirmed that an altercation took place, but told HuffPost that no one was in custody over it and that an investigation into the incident is ongoing.Crawford, with blood still dripping from his nose, told HuffPost from his office in Orange that in his 22 years as an attorney, he's never heard of or experienced anything like this before.Crawford just last month won a new trial for his client Henry Rodriguez when a judge ruled county prosecutors illegally withheld jailhouse informant evidence. Rodriguez has spent the past 15 years in state prison for the double murder of a pregnant Fullerton woman and her unborn daughter in 1998.""Two weeks ago, I get Henry a new trial and this week the DA office's investigators are assaulting me,"" Crawford said. Tom Dominguez, president of the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, said in a statement that Crawford's ""one-sided version"" of events was false.""A careful investigation will reveal the true facts,"" Dominguez said. ""We are cooperating fully in that investigation and we look forward to the actual facts being released publicly.""Multiple murder cases have already been derailed by revelations out of Orange County's formerly secret jailhouse informant network, some accused murderers have even walked free, and Rodriguez's case is just the latest to be caught in the fallout. But Rodriguez likely won't be the last. While it remains unclear how many cases may be affected by tainted informant evidence, Deputy Public Defender Scott Sanders has argued that any murder case in the county from the last 30 years in which an informant was used deserves to be re-examined. Sanders first unearthed the alleged violations within the county's secret jailhouse informant program, as well as internal records from the program that may have been improperly concealed for decades.With regard to informant evidence, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately.This story has been updated to include comment from the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs."

Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla.) has come under fire from her fellow Democrats due to her actions in defense of payday lenders.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e1aa0f1500002a000b195d.jpeg?cache=FTB4Qu3RIg&ops=crop_17_291_4351_2621%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) has been working to gut new rules intended to rein in predatory payday lending. Her fellow Democrats don't seem pleased.Allied Progress, an activist group headed by the longtime liberal operative Karl Frisch, is airing a new ad in Florida hammering Wasserman Schultz's efforts to undermine the regulations. The ad assails Wasserman Schultz -- the nominal head of the Democratic Party -- for teaming up with Republicans to defeat a policy backed by President Barack Obama. Watch the ad below:The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to present a final set of payday lending regulations in the next few weeks. The idea is to prevent lenders from trapping borrowers in a vicious cycle of debt, in which borrowers take out a loan expecting to pay a one-time fee, but end up taking out several more loans when they are unable to make ends meet at the end of the loan period.Wasserman Schultz is trying to gin up support on Capitol Hill for a bill that would nullify the CFPB's rules in states that adopt payday loan rules similar to those in her home state. The Florida law is supported by the payday loan industry and has not prevented lenders from preying on the poor. The CFPB's regulations would be stronger, but Wasserman Schultz is seeking to block them.More than three-fourths of payday loans issued in Florida are so-called ""turned"" loans that borrowers take out to help them pay off a previous loan, according to Americans for Financial Reform. The average annual interest rate on a Florida payday loan is over 300 percent, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts.""The Congresswoman wants to work with the CFPB on the way forward, and believes the Florida law is an example of how to achieve their shared goals of balancing strong consumer protections with preserving access to credit in underserved communities,"" Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett told The Huffington Post last week.Several other Florida Democrats, including Rep. Patrick Murphy, a former Mitt Romney donor who is currently running for Senate, also support the bill. But Wasserman Schultz's influence as DNC chair has made her backing uniquely unnerving to liberal Democrats. Wasserman Schultz isn't just taking heat in Florida. On Wednesday, dozens of activists with National Peoples Action held a protest outside the DNC's headquarters in Washington, calling on Wasserman Schultz to resign her position as chair over the payday loan issue. Protesters held up an inflatable shark and mock movie posters for ""Sharknado 4"" depicting Wasserman Schultz as an ally of ""payday loan sharks."" The real ""Sharknado 4"" will star Tara Reid and Gary Busey.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So, That Happened."" Subscribe here or listen to the latest episode below:  "
