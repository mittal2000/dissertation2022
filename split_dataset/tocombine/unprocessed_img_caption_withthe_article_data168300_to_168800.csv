With its drum circles and decorated art cars, guerilla theatrics and colorful theme camps, the annual pilgrimage to the playa in the name of both everything and nothing has become just too darn popular for its own good.

Here are some of our favorite travel memories from 2012. Happy holidays, and safe travels in the new year! The Great Outdoors• Warren Chang, New York: ""Setting foot on Antarctica! I not only wanted to visit Antarctica but to set foot on the continent. I was privileged to find a cruise line and good weather from Mother Nature, which enabled me to set foot onto Port Lockroy, Antarctica. Port Lockroy houses a former British research facility that has since been turned into a small museum, gift shop -- and post office!"" • Ainslie Hogarth, Toronto: ""This year I visited Peggy's Cove in Nova Scotia, an extensive granite outcrop overlooking the Atlantic Ocean with an unpredictable and often breathtaking surf. Seeing the giant waves explode against the rocks filled me with both awe of nature's boundless wonders, and the overwhelming urge to belt out ""Little Mermaid"" lyrics. Also you can find any variety of lobster knick-knack in the nearby town, including a lobster yo-yo which I purchased with every intention of gifting to my niece, but instead kept because I'm shellfish."" • Blaire Constantinou, Los Angeles: ""We brought back many great memories of Australia, from feeding kangaroos at Steve Irwin's Australia Zoo to surfing the waves at Bells Beach. The most memorable was driving up the Eastern coast and taking in the metropolitan cities, internationally famous surf beaches, and coastal Bohemian and rain forest-fringed towns."" • Kelsey Rexroat, New York: ""My favorite travel moment was in Muscat, Oman: watching the sun set over the Gulf of Oman after a day of exploring its underwater life on a scuba excursion."" • Lily Fu, Los Angeles: ""Boating in Sian Ka'an (protected biosphere south of Tulum in Riviera Maya and UNESCO World Heritage Site) and being circled by dolphins and turtles!"" • Angela Tablac, Miami: ""My favorite travel moment was in Peru, walking through Machu Picchu just after the morning fog cleared away. It was such an emotional moment for me because it was the culmination of a four-day, 34-mile hike on the Inca Trail -- complete with dizzying altitude sickness, three nights of sleeping awkwardly in a one-person tent and a lot of walking every day. Going through the good and the not-so-good on that four-day trek made finally seeing Machu Picchu all the more worthwhile and special.""  European Adventures• Erica Wacker, Chicago: ""Ringing in the new year outside Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral with hundreds of revelers from around the world."" • Annalisa Henderson, New York: ""In March I traveled to the City of Light -- Paris -- for a long weekend with my best friend, Jenny, after we were inspired by a fantastic airfare in the Top 20. Springtime in this beautiful city means lovely weather and, best of all, slim crowds. Besides happily sitting at sidewalk cafes and attempting to learn French phrases from my fluent friend, highlights included napping on a bench in the Jardin des Tuileries, indulging in exquisite macarons from Pierre Hermé, dining at tiny locals-only wine bars and admiring the graceful architecture of Notre Dame at midnight. Sometimes the best trips are the unexpected ones."" • Courtney Brooks, Miami: ""Traveling to and throughout Italy to the Amalfi Coast, Capri and Rome with such a close and special friend, exploring and sharing in the beautiful scenery, staying at amazing top-rated hotels, enjoying the culture, outstanding food and wine at Michelin and local restaurants and making my birthday celebration a memory that will last forever!"" • Jen Lee, Los Angeles: ""Uncorking a bottle of wine on a rooftop in Strasbourg, France, and toasting to a view of a million twinkling Christmas market stalls.""City Escapes• Jessica Tilley, Las Vegas: ""Taking an elevator ride to the top of Coit Tower in San Francisco. It was such an amazing spot for a 360 view of the Bay Area."" • William Brown, Chicago: ""My favorite travel experience of the year was in Las Vegas when I stayed at Trump. All I have to say is: SnoBar margarita ice pops. They were absolutely delicious and surprisingly potent. Nothing better to combat the offensive heat by the pool -- and you have to eat them really quickly. I am currently looking into a franchise.""The Unusual & Unexpected • Andrea Kahn, New York: ""I spent an incredible afternoon in rural Estonia along the Russian border in Setomaa, whose inhabitants are a cultural/linguistic minority in Estonia and Russia known for their tradition of choral singing. Though we had no common language, four women who had been singing together for nearly 50 years and have performed in music festivals in cities like New York took us to visit the graves of their ancestors and then sang four-part a cappella traditional music for us. I was touched by their openness and wowed by their musical talent."" • Ashley Pyle, Chicago: ""I watched the Kansas Jayhawks win during March Madness in the middle of the ocean on our Caribbean cruise."" • Matt Ring, New York: ""I was in Jerusalem we walked through an archaeological excavation as it was going on. It was a new tunnel that was discovered leading from outside the modern city walls to right outside the Temple Mount (inside today's Old City). They were sending bags of sand through the tunnel on a pulley so we had to wait until all the bags swung down before you could walk through. It was not open to the public, only to those traveling with tour guides who are familiar with the excavation. It was really cool!"" • Karl Klockars, Chicago: ""The Traverse City Film Festival (Michigan) is always a high point of the summer. A few days to escape to Northern Michigan and see a dozen movies or so, combined with the restaurants and craft breweries that abound up there, is an awesome time that I anticipate on an annual basis."" • Debbie Kwok, Mountain View: ""Eating fermented shark in Iceland with friends I've made on the trip.""Family Fun• Nicole Pointon, Vancouver: ""For this Muggle-born mom, the idea of spending a whole week at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando at the request of my five-year-old was a little daunting. But once I got there, I never wanted to leave. I'm still dizzy from circling back into line at the Flight of the Hippogriff over and over and over again."" • Andrew Young, New York: ""Hiking through the slot canyon with my two boys and family to the top of Tent Rocks National Park in New Mexico near Santa Fe. Spread your arms and you can touch the canyon walls. When you get to the top, the view of the mesa for miles around is humbling."" • Haifa Sweeny, San Francisco: ""Visiting a farm in Parma in Italy where a father and son were making Parmesan cheese and then getting the chance to taste the raw cheese!"" • Angela Shannon, Chicago: ""Dipping my five-month-old daughter's toes in the sand for the first time while vacationing in Miami, and later, watching her run sand through her fingers; may she be a lifelong traveler and explorer."" • Caroline Eber, New York: ""My sister and I learned that a popular hiking trail in Ireland led to the top of Croagh Patrick, where legend has it that St. Patrick banished all the snakes from the country. What we didn't know -- until about halfway up the mountain -- is that this climb, most commonly done as a religious pilgrimage, becomes incredibly steep, rocky and scary toward the top. After a harrowing climb, making it to the summit and discovering St. Patrick's beautiful chapel was my favorite travel moment this year. Until we had to turn around and find a way down...."" • Chris Vassil, Chicago: ""My visit to Disney World this year proved that the 'happiest place on earth' is just as much fun at 30 years old as it was at 10. With adult beverages, fine dining and behind-the-scenes tours, our new twist on a family-favorite turned out to be not only the first family vacation we've taken in almost a decade, but also one of our most memorable ones.""Ready to start planning 2013 trips?

Hedge fund managers are paid enormous sums, usually 2 percent of the investment amount and 20 percent of profits above a fixed level. As money has poured into these funds over time, hedge fund managers and others working in the industry have become fabulously wealthy. But, now, here's the rub, the investors haven't benefited. In fact, hedge fund investments have consistently performed substantially worse than basic investments in low-fee equity index funds, exchange traded funds or a simple mix of equity and bond funds. I am an outsider to the world of hedge funds in that I neither work nor invest in hedge funds. Without an ounce of insincerity, I can state that I don't understand how this industry survives, let alone has thrived for so long. Hedge funds are not generally open to average investors, but rather receive their funding from institutional investors (the source of roughly two-thirds of hedge funds' assets) and people categorized as sophisticated investors (presumably wealthy individuals with investing knowledge/experience). Those investing in hedge funds are generally not naïve to the fact that these funds, on average, provide much lower returns than equity indexes. Moreover, investors generally are aware that the lower returns are due to the high fees that the hedge fund managers extract from investors. Yet, in spite of the historically poor return on investment, money continues pouring into hedge funds -- they currently manage $2.2 trillion in assets or roughly four times more than in 2000.So why would a class of investors who are well-aware of investment options, strategies, risks and expected returns continue to plow money into hedge funds, knowing they have a comparatively low rate of return? I posed this question to some contacts in the industry. A consistent reply was of the form, ""Yes, on average hedge funds aren't a good investment compared to index funds, but if you do your research you can find hedge funds that have great returns at relatively low risk."" Of course, this logic works for any stock picking, selecting of mutual funds or, for that matter, horse racing, football games or any other type of gambling. It is a well-established fact that very few traders or mutual funds have seen consistent year-over-year returns on investment above market performance. In fact, last year's most successful performer is often the laggard the next (due to reversion to the mean). One reply I received during a conversation with a hedge fund employee was that ""by diversifying across many classes of investments, including hedge funds, the investor's average return for their portfolio is expected to be higher even if hedge funds tend to drop down the average."" When I pushed that theoretical explanation to the real world by asking, ""but if I had diversified my portfolio 10 years ago so I had a basket of hedge funds included in my current mix of stocks and mutual funds, on average wouldn't I have less money now?"" the answer was a sheepish, ""Yes, you would less money if you had diversified into hedge funds because of the hedge fund manager's fees."" I followed up by asking, ""since the fee structure is a primary reason why the investor isn't getting a higher return on investment, why don't hedge funds make themselves more appealing to investors by competing on fees. After all, don't institutional investors complain about what seems like collusion?"" He smiled at me and then quoted The Wire by stating, ""It's all in the game, brother. It's all in the game.""Since return on investment is clearly not the main reason for the ongoing popularity of hedge funds, one has to wonder what else is driving the ongoing appeal? Is it that investors are swayed by smooth sales pitches where hedges funds tout their extensive collection of Ph.D.'s busy combing the data to find market inefficiencies? Is it the exclusivity factor, where the appeal is based on the fact that average investors like myself cannot join the hedge fund investor club? Are institutional investors and hedge funds are so tightly linked that the fact that the institutional investor's clients aren't benefiting from hedge funds has become irrelevant?A popular stock market cliché is that that market is short-term irrational but long term rational. If that is truly the case, then in the long term we should either see hedge fund manager's fees drop dramatically so that investor's return on hedge fund investments increases or a major drop in the percent of investor's money going into hedge funds. Until that day happens, it is difficult for me to watch Squawk Box without thinking of Omar Little, Maury Levy and the rest of The Wire."

Occupy, which took root in New York City's Zuccotti Park in September 2011 and spread to cities across the country, targeted corporations and other forces it believed to perpetuate social inequality. The FBI's investigation included the movement's manifestations in New York; Milwaukee; Indianapolis; Anchorage, Alaska; Jacksonville, Fla.; Richmond, Va.; and Memphis, Tenn., among others.The FBI did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post's requests for comment Sunday.In September, the Northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union obtained documents that detailed the FBI's surveillance of the Occupy movement in that region. At the time, the FBI told the San Francisco Chronicle that its investigations were being performed in a way that ""respects liberty and privacy and avoids unnecessary intrusions into the lives of law-abiding people.""According to the new documents, the FBI began meeting with representatives of the New York Stock Exchange and other businesses as early as August 2011, a month before the Zuccotti Park protests.In Jackson, Miss., the local FBI office attended a meeting with private banks and the police to discuss a ""National Bad Bank Sit-In-Day"" protest in December 2011.The documents are heavily redacted, a point that the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund considers to be evidence of the FBI's attempt to withhold relevant information.

There's no easy answer to whether it's right or wrong to do so, nor is that the point of this post. This exploration is around whether parents are aware of what they are doing when they're doing it. A fact-of-life in America today is that people keep guns in their homes. Maybe you don't have guns in your house, but other parents do. So, it makes sense for parents to ask about guns every time they drop their children off for a playdate, or sleepover, or birthday party. And, if the answer is ""Yes, I do have guns in my home,"" a number of follow-up questions emerge immediately:• How many guns do you own? • What kind of guns are they? • Are your guns loaded? • Where do you keep them? • Are your guns kept in a locked cabinet? • Do your children know where your guns are? • Do your children know where to find the keys to the cabinet? • From these questions other questions will naturally emerge, I promise.I'm not an expert on guns (although as a child I got pretty good at knocking soda cans off of a block during target practice) but I do know something about awareness. And, one of the most powerful by-products of awareness is that once you're aware of something your relationship to it will change. Thoughtful, steady, and open-minded conversation around people's motivations for owning guns, and their care in keeping them away from children and those who may not have a good-hearted motivation, is how those in favor of gun control and those against it can find common ground."

Not from a cold or flu, but from yelling.A recent morning began with me entering The Redhead's room and saying, ""My God! It smells like you've been farting in here all night!"" A grunt was the only response I received as I retreated from his room. It doesn't typically smell good, but this smell was horrendous. It was way beyond the musty, body odor of a middle school teenager that usually wafted from behind his closed door. He, unlike me, was suffering from a cold and so couldn't smell anything.Waking the boys up has gone from being a nice ritual to being something I dread. They are grumpy and whine and protest anything I say or do. It is no longer a pleasant way to start the day. But I have persisted because I felt it was my job as their mom. As is making their lunches. And buying the groceries that go in those lunches.Only since they've all joined middle school (Thing 1 and Thing 2 turned 12 this fall and The Redhead is 13) they've become moody. Sullen. Picky eaters. Complainers. Cry at the drop of a hat. Fight each other. Argue nonstop. Refuse to wear deodorant. Never want to bathe. Don't brush their teeth or clip their nails. They are, quite simply, pigs. I know of which I speak because we share one bathroom (but that's another story for another day).So when you pair a sullen attitude with slovenly behavior, you have a recipe for mom repulsion. And irritation.That's mostly how I feel towards them lately. Irritated and repulsed.But I went about my school morning duties, making macaroni and cheese so they'd have something hot in their lunches (and because there were no other lunch fixings in the house), putting a load of laundry in the dryer that would probably not be dry in time for them to wear anything from it to school and trying to check my work email with a faulty Internet connection. You can see how this is shaping up, can't you?It was around this time that one of the twins (searching for a missing shoe) was assaulted by the horrific smell coming from The Redhead's room and went to investigate. He discovered that Yellow Dog had pooped on the carpet, in two places. I don't know how I'd missed this. One pile was behind the door and had been smeared and dragged underneath the door when I opened it.When he reported this to me in the kitchen, I said, ""Well, I can't clean it up! I've got all this other stuff to do!"" Just as quickly, Aquaman said, ""Not it!""It was then that the Christmas shrew arrived. And by shrew, I mean me.I freaked out and started yelling. The Redhead fled the house with no notification, without lunch or his band instrument, to avoid being yelled at (and to avoid cleaning poop). He was at the bus stop thirty minutes early. Now we had a missing shoe and a missing boy, along with Aquaman attempting poop cleanup while retching. I finally got the Internet connection working, made sure there were no urgent work emails, and went to finish shit detail before I had vomit detail as well.Aquaman walked Thing 1 and Thing 2 to the bus stop. I might have screamed at him when he returned about how the boys needed real attitude adjustments and it was all his fault. Then I left to do my work from a coffee shop downtown. Not my proudest moment.But here's what came of it: I now wake them up -- one time -- and do not return to their rooms. There are three alarm clocks wrapped and under the Christmas tree, so come December 26th I won't even be doing that. I stay out of the kitchen in the morning and let them make their own lunches. I instead bite my tongue to stop myself from reminding them to hurry and eat breakfast, brush their teeth, take their asthma medicine, put on their shoes and head to the bus stop. It is quite difficult. I'm pretty sure not one of them brushed their teeth this morning. But my throat is not sore because I'm not yelling anymore.I've been enforcing the chore chart schedule I began a year ago and have not returned their xBox since they lost the privilege of playing it a week ago because they constantly fight about whose turn it is. Life is just more pleasant without it. Because we're tired of finding towels on the floor after one use, Aquaman suggested we get rid of all towels and give each boy one of a different color. So I bought three plush, brightly colored towels. They are wrapped and under the tree. Each boy gets one. They can only use that one towel. If they leave it on the floor, we know the offender based on the color and they're stuck using it off the floor rather than claiming it is someone else's and getting a new one from the bathroom cabinet.Instead of reaching down to pick up something on the floor while thinking, ""If I don't pick it up, no one else will,"" I've begun waiting until there's a boy around. I make him do it.I had a talk with The Redhead about how he can't run away from conflict (and certainly can't leave the house without telling a parent) and that the best thing for him to do when there's a crazy morning with someone yelling is to ask, ""What can I do to help?"" or even better, ""I'll clean up the poop, Mom."" I explained that if he didn't want to be yelled at, he should step up and do his chores, get ready for school on his own, and help around the house. I emphasized the point that I could do it all, but that it stressed me out and shouting would probably be involved. He seemed to understand this.Raising three middle school boys at once is tough work. We visited my brother, who has two daughters of similar ages, recently. The differences that exist between girls and boys was glaringly obvious. My nieces are happy and talkative and animated. When a friend waves to them they smile and wave back. When a friend waves to the boys, they shrug their shoulders and look away. They are moody. They are rude. They are selfish. I know this is normal because I read The Male Brain by Louann Brizendine, M.D.But it's still hard. And you know what? I refuse to be the shrew. I refuse to be the mom who yells and nags and never lets up. I have taught them about personal hygiene -- they just opt not to groom themselves. If it reaches the point that I can smell them, I will inform them that they won't be going anywhere or doing anything until they bathe. They know what chores to do and when, they just try to get out of it. So I'll use the same technique: go nowhere, do nothing until chores are done. On the agenda this afternoon is teaching The Redhead how to do his own laundry.We'll see how it goes. But I'm done yelling."
