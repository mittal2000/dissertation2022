Much of the area is long overdue for revitalizations to keep the history preserved and alive, but first here are five things you probably didn't know about Five Points:1. Five Points is one of Denver's oldest neighborhoods, and it used to be made up of primarily German, Irish and Jewish populations.  The area was named ""Five Points"" in 1881 for the five-way intersection of 26th Street, 27th Avenue, Washington and Welton Streets. From 1890 onward, Five Points grew into an African American community as many found work laying down track for railroad companies. It would sometimes be called ""The Harlem of the West"" for its rich jazz history. In 2002, Five Points was recognized as a cultural historic district.

The Rossonian Hotel hosted jazz legends. The Rossonian sits literally in the heart of Five Points, at the five-way intersection for which Five Points is named. Jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Billy Holiday, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Charlie Parker played there. According to the Five Points Business District, many of the jazz musicians would stay in Five Points after wrapping up their downtown Denver gigs because the hotels in Denver wouldn't house them. Today however, the hotel sits empty.   The Rossonian Hotel, at 27th and Welton, in Five Points on Friday, January 28, 2011. All haunts of Neal Cassady.

The Roxy and Casino Cabaret were known to count Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and other Beatnicks as frequent visitors. In Denver a group of fans have even spray-painted the areas visited by Kerouac with his iconic image and documented it on a Tumblr called ""Jack Was Here.""

This fascinating museum is located in the home of Colorado's first black woman doctor, Dr. Justina Ford. The museum tells the story of black cowboys, and Dearfield, Colo. The town of Dearfield, just east of Greeley, was founded on the principles of Booker T. Washington and was an all-black town before the Great Depression ultimately forced everyone back into the cities. Dearfield is now a ghost town.  5. Five Points still honors its jazz heritage with their annual Jazz Festival.  This year's Jazz Festival brought together sidewalk chalk artists, Latin music and jazz to Five Points for free music and outdoor dancing.

In an interview with the Guardian on Friday, the size 12 stunner reveals thats she's loath to endorse any label, big or small.Robyn thinks that celebrating a so-called plus-size shape can be damaging to thin women as well as larger ones. ""People use me as a [plus-size] figurehead,"" she says, ""and to me that misses the point and is blatantly offensive to thin women."" She continues:""Curves don't epitomise a woman. Saying, 'Skinny is ugly' should be no more acceptable than saying fat is. I find all this stuff a very controlling and effective way of making women obsess over their weight, instead of exploiting their more important attributes, such as intellect, strength and power. We could be getting angry about unequal pay and unequal opportunities, but we're too busy being told we're not thin enough or curvy enough. We're holding ourselves back.""Many industry insiders have been advocating to cut size distinctions from our vocabulary -- including Dana Oliver, HuffPost Style's senior beauty editor, who argues that ""pushing... women of all sizes into unrealistic body type categories further perpetuates this warped standard of beauty that exists within the fashion world."" And more institutions like the JAG Model Agency are popping up, attempting to bridge the gap between plus- and straight-size models by representing both in the same space.Lawley has a point. Perhaps if we work to shift our focus away from body labels, we can instead improve on the plus-size designs that critics like Tim Gunn have dubbed ""devastating."" After all, size is nothing but a number, and fashion should not ""hold [women] back,"" as Lawley mentions, but empower them to project their most confident selves instead.Robyn rules:Want more?

He regularly co-preaches with his father and",2013-08-24,"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., co-pastor with his father of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Ga., is shown as he speaks in Eutaw, Ala., June 4, 1965. Head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Nobel Peace Prize winner, King's policy of non-violence often has led to violent reactions. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badece32100000001c6b9a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III, the civil rights movement is not a period of time that only exists in history books; the movement runs deep in his veins -- literally. With a mother who was a secretary for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and a father who was an early organizer for the movement, an active minister and regional director for the SCLC, both of whom were eventually married to each other by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. himself, Moss has deeply rooted ties to the history of social activism. As close family friends of not only the Kings, but also other noteworthy individuals like Fannie Lou Hamer, Ralph David Abernathy and Andrew Young, Moss’ parents created an environment where spirituality and social responsibility were tied to one another. “This was a part of my development,” Moss told The Huffington Post. “It was really how I became engaged not only in social justice activity, but I was nurtured and educated in a church that said that love and justice and Jesus are connected. When love and justice come together they produce a baby: first name liberation, last name transformation. That’s the kind of church I grew up in.”As senior pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, a congregation heavily engaged in community activism, Moss is a product of the kind of black church that comes to mind when thinking about the historic movement that affected so much change in the United States. The sort of church where members congregated before rallies, singing gospel songs and preparing to fight injustice, with a pastor who delivered fervent and inspiring speeches against inequality. But it is that exact characterization that some say has created a mythical legacy that the present-day church is struggling to live up to. Reality v. MythologyLike many African-Americans, Moss grew up believing most black churches were involved in social activism like his. However, he said that is a false assumption largely based on the glamorization of the civil rights movement. “Many churches, black churches in particular, have proclivity for social justice. But there’s only a remnant that have made that part of their mission,” he said. “On one level it’s bittersweet that everyone loves Dr. King and loves the Civil Rights Movement now that we can have a newseum gaze, but in the reality, for those who were participating, this was a life or death decision and it was a remnant of people.”The Rev. Nelson Rivers, vice president of stakeholder relations of the NAACP, agreed saying the fictitious characterization of the church is a challenge to the church’s present standing. “I think one thing that affects the black church today is the mythology of the black church’s involvement of yesterday,” he told The Huffington Post. “There’s a growing consensus that justice must be on the black church’s agenda, and that was not the case even in the old days.”Rivers said clergymen like King, Abernathy and Adam Clayton Powell had in fact split from conservative leaders who distanced themselves from the movement. As a result, their names -- Dr. King’s most prominently--became synonymous with the Civil Rights movement, although in reality, pastors only made up a small sect of leaders and organizers. “That was a myth created by an exaggerated reality because of the power and personality of King. But even the first march, the majority of the leaders were not preachers,” he said. “A great disservice of the movement is to summarize it in the name of one person, it was never that. Too many people paid the price, including Dr. King.”It is that exact longing for messianic leadership that many say cripple not only the church’s progress but the black community’s as well, and fuel criticism of present-day leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. “I don’t think a messianic leader structure is especially what we need right now,” founder and senior pastor of Community of Hope A.M.E. Church in Maryland, the Rev. Tony Lee, told The Huffington Post. “If you look at the movement, it was about a whole lot more than King. The civil rights movement was about organizing on a fundamental, regular person level. The challenge right now is, we deal with people who want to be in the front of the movement but the movement has no infrastructure.”Bridging The Generation GapDespite the glamorization of the movement, one fact remains undisputed. The black church leadership of the King era faced a very different social landscape and served a very different type of community 50 years ago, a factor that has created a gap between the older and younger generation of pastors.Because segregation limited black people’s options of where they could congregate, celebrate or even carry out business, the church was a central part of the community’s survival as one of the few black-owned institutions, Moss said. “Segregation completely changed the dynamic,” he said. “The church was the epicenter for your economic, sociological and psychological community-based meetings.”In the post-civil rights era, the church’s significance has shifted as African-Americans have gained access to services and opportunities they were denied before.“Increasingly the black church is a choice, when in the past it was our only option we had left,” Rivers said. As a result, Lee said black churches have to change the way they connect with their congregations and support the modern day movement, although their message remains the same. “Movement shifts,” he said. “During that time period that kind of movement was necessary. I think that in this technological age, that understanding movement and platform might shift.”The seasoned ministers who fought injustice in the 1950s and 60s come from a world where taking initiative and working with organizations like the NAACP and the Urban League was one of the only ways to affect change across a national platform. But technology has opened up opportunities for younger pastors to gain access to communities in a way their forefathers could not, and they’re waiting for the old guard to pass the torch. “You’re watching a new generation trying to find their voice and deciding to do what they have they have to do,” Lee said. “You have an old guard who it wasn’t handed to, and a younger generation waiting for them to hand it over, and they’re looking at them like ‘when are you going to take it?’”As a second-generation pastor, Moss is familiar with bridging generation gaps. He regularly co-preaches with his father and will be delivering a sermon alongside him at the March On Washington 50th anniversary ecumenical service. He said he and his father aim to communicate the same message in a way both generations will understand, and encourages other ministers to do the same. “Each generation has to find its own footing,” he said. “But also, they need to have sages that can give them reflection about where they’ve been and the oral history about what needs to happen for the generation to move forward. The baton needs to be passed, but in some cases, it needs to be wrestled from the hands of those who refuse to let go.”On Life Support?Perhaps the most challenging struggle the church faces is a question of its relevance for a community that once revered it as the lifeblood of African-American culture. But Lee said members shouldn’t be distracted by the difference in how injustice plays out in this country. “I feel we’re fighting a more nuanced fight,” he said. “Back then, the issues were a lot clearer because you could actually see segregation. But if you look at the statistics the issues are very similar.” Although the community no longer relies on the church the way it did during the Jim Crow era, it still looks to it to solve issues of injustice, largely based on the glamorized characterization of the civil rights movement.“A lot of time the church receives a critique that is not its to bear,” Lee said. “People want the church to receive all of the weight of systems that are unjust and dysfunctional.”But Rivers said although black institutions like the church can help get closer to that goal by spreading a positive message and teaching, that’s a job for both individuals in the black community and the federal government to help carry out. “We can’t be the only ones responsible,” he said. “Teaching has a commensurate side, it’s called learning. For every bit of teaching there’s got to be some learning.”While Lee said the community needs to learn from the successes of the of the civil rights era, it cannot get caught up in fictitious characterization of the church, or rely on one or two individuals to lead the way or gain fame from the movement. “I think the church has to come all hands on deck, and in that the church has to use all of the resources of this current age,” he said. “We have the resources because of technology to shift what the movement looks like. But it cannot just be about people seeing our faces and us becoming leaders it has to be about empowering people, organizing people, training people so that they have a sense of what to do, how to do it and where to do it.”"

They just dropped into the sea. He was by a window so he was able to escape that way as it rolled over.""Scottish police said three bodies had been recovered and work was under way to recover the body of the fourth. Sky News said the fourth body was in the wreckage. All those killed - three men and one woman - were passengers.All four were contractors and only one Total employee was on board, a Total spokeswoman. The others were from 12 separate contractor firms, she said.All 14 passengers and two crew died in April 2009 when Super Puma crashed off Peterhead on the east coast of Scotland on its way back from BP's Millier oil platform.Last year the crew of a Super Puma ditched the aircraft in the North Sea after a gearbox failure and, also last year, all 19 on another Super Puma were rescued after it ditched during a flight from Aberdeen to the West Phoenix rig, west of Shetland.CHC said it would not speculate on the cause of the incident and it would carry out an investigation with Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB). It temporarily suspended its Super Puma L2 flights worldwide and all flights in Aberdeen.A Eurocopter spokesman said the company was supporting CHC and the authorities with their investigations. AAIB Chief Inspector Keith Conradi told the BBC that the group expects to publish a report containing safety recommendations within the next few days after reviewing the wreckage and black box data.Bob Crow, general secretary of offshore union RMT said that workforce confidence in Super Puma aircraft had already been hit by previous incidents.""We will support any member who refuses to board any suspect aircraft type in light of this disaster,"" he said."

""You gotta be there.""The mayor notably drew criticism in 2010 for not being there at the beginning of a blizzard that clogged city roads and slowed emergency services from responding to people in need.This isn't the first time that Bloomberg has spoken out against bathroom breaks, as the Daily Intelligencer noted this morning. ""Don’t ever take a lunch break or go to the bathroom, you keep working,"" Bloomberg told TechCrunch in 2011. ""You don’t ever know when that opportunity is going to come along.”What the mayor may not realize is that infrequent urination can have particularly painful effects on a significant segment of the population.Women are far more prone to getting urinary tract infections than men -- and holding it for too long, as well as not drinking enough water, both increase the risk of contracting one. How to avoid them? ""Urinate when you need to. Don't hold it,"" a fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advises.It's kind of hard to lean in when you've got a UTI."

And while Americans still have a negative perception of the two sectors overall, both industries have recovered a great deal from the plunge they took after the crisis.
