0,WELLNESS,Hey Women: Paint-on Muscles Aren't Going to Help When You're Old,"Dana McMahan, Contributor
Food, Travel and Fitness Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-weight-lifting_us_5b9d4072e4b03a1dcc85f59e,"We need to stop accepting the magazines stories that tell us to avoid bulking up at all costs, especially when that cost could be to our bone health.",2013-06-13,I prefer barbells to bronzer for my so-called sculpting and toning. Photo by John Adkins II,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-06-12-JWA_0160L-thumb.jpg,"We all know lifting weights is good for us. It boosts confidence, builds muscle that lets us eat more, and helps fend off excess body fat. Not to mention the practical implications of being able to, say, put your own suitcase in the plane's overhead, carry your groceries, and pick up a kid. But if you read the mainstream women's/fitness magazines, you know by now that you should only ever lift two pound dumbbells. Right? Because even the faintest whisper of the world bulky strikes an icicle of purest terror into your heart.And just in case those pink dumbbells aren't quite enough to make you happy in that summer dress (OMG, what if you have what one writer calls ""mushy fat arms""?), the magazines have more wisdom for you. Paint on some muscles! Nothing bulky, perish the thought. Just some, you know, matte bronzer to make your tricep area look smaller and some highlighter to make your bicep pop: ""Your arm will look much more sculpted and toned."" I prefer barbells to bronzer for my so-called sculpting and toning. Photo by John Adkins III read the paint-on muscle story the day I was to have a DEXA scan at Canyon Ranch in Miami. On a travel assignment to scope out the spa and medical offerings, I played guinea pig and lay on a table for an x-ray that would show everything from how much muscle and fat I have in my left leg (more than in my right, it turns out) to how hard my skull is (insert your own joke here). I chatted with the tech while he administered the scan, telling him about my powerlifting days. As he went through my results (and P.S. if you ever want proof that scales are irrelevant, get this scan), he stopped short at a page and looked at me. ""Your bone density is practically off the charts!"" he said. ""You can thank your heavy lifting for that -- and go tell women to pick up some weights."" With a bone density score of 1.204 (on a scale of 0.575 to 1.282) as long as I continue resistance exercise, I don't have to fear catastrophic events later in life like bumping into a corner and crushing my hip. My own physician has always been concerned about my risk of osteoporosis (as a small-framed woman) and counseled calcium supplements, which I never took. However, I took up heavy lifting in my mid 30s -- my first athletic endeavor since some lackluster lady's gym workouts in the late 90s. I found a community of like-minded women -- a growing group that loves to lift heavy, but one that's still in the minority. I want to shout from the rooftops that women need to take their rightful place in weight rooms. We need to interrupt group fitness instructors when they say ""OK ladies, grab a three pound dumbbell, and guys, get a 10."" We need to stop accepting the magazines stories that tell us to avoid bulking up at all costs, especially when that cost is our bone health. (And besides, who are they to say bulky is even bad?) We should assume that we can use a barbell when we bench press, and not the itsy bitsy dumbbells our BFF Jillian recommends. And we should expect female action stars in films to look like they won't fall over in a breeze (Jennifer Lawrence notwithstanding). But you aren't likely to read this message in a glossy women's magazine at the checkout. I've pitched variations of this story for two years to mainstream women's media. And the biggies won't touch the word powerlifting with a 10 foot pole. Even stories that purport to tell women to lift heavy run photos alongside of workouts featuring the lightest weights in the gym (though clearly there's a hunger to hear this -- that story clocked in 10,000 Facebook likes!). Editors who aren't afraid of a little controversy (or upsetting their advertisers or of telling women they have to work hard in the gym) have let me spread my weightlifting gospel online where I'm mostly preaching to the choir, but for the foreseeable future, the best way to keep your bones strong and healthy will be one of the best-kept secrets in women's fitness. How about we change that? Tweet or email this story to the magazines who run stories like paint-your-own-muscles and tell them you prefer to actually build your muscles -- and while you're at it build your bones, and build a society of women who are strong, healthy, and fearless.For more by Dana McMahan click here.For more on fitness and exercise, click here."
1,WELLNESS,What Social Media Reveals About Narcissism,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-narcissism-twitter-facebook_us_5b9d3f04e4b03a1dcc85e6ed,"While it is certain that online forms of communication and social networks do affect individual's mental health, the solution",2013-06-13,"A Facebook Inc. logo is displayed at the top of the login page for facebook.com on a computer screen in Tiskilwa, Illinois, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2013.

The research, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, shows that Twitter fuels younger adults' narcissistic tendencies by acting as a megaphone for their thoughts, while Facebook fuels middle aged adults' narcissistic tendencies by serving as a mirror where they can curate images of themselves. ""Young people may overevaluate the importance of their own opinions,"" study researcher Elliot Panek, who just received his doctorate in communication studies from the University of Michigan, said in a statement. ""Through Twitter, they're trying to broaden their social circles and broadcast their views about a wide range of topics and issues.""For the study, researchers examined two populations: the first was 486 college students, most of whom were female, with an average age of 19, and the second was 93 adults who were mostly white females, with an average age of 35. The college students answered questions about social media use and took personality tests to assess their narcissistic tendencies, while the adults took online surveys. Researchers found associations between scoring higher on certain traits of narcissism and increased use of Twitter (more posts) among the college students. And for the adults, narcissistic traits were linked with more Facebook status updates. Of course, at this point it should hardly be surprising that social media is a reflection of narcissistic tendencies. A study that came out last year in the journal Personality and Individual Differences showed that people who score higher on a narcissism questionnaire are also more frequent Facebook posters and photo taggers, and had more Facebook friends, The Guardian reported. HuffPost blogger Lisa Firestone, a psychology expert and author of ""Conquer Your Critical Voice,"" wrote in a post that the self-promotional nature of these social media sites, as well as an increase in instilling self-esteem in millennial generations, could be promoting this phenomenon. She wrote:While it is certain that online forms of communication and social networks do affect individual's mental health, the solution to fostering a less narcissistic generation is to instill a healthy sense of true esteem offline before anyone is old enough to post their first status update. Only by being less self-obsessed and placing more value on personal relating can we impart these values to the next generation."
2,WELLNESS,The Sun After Skin Cancer: When a Head-to-Toe Glow is No Longer an Option,"Vogue, Contributor

Instead of joining them, I found myself grabbing my Panama hat and heading straight to the pharmacy to stock up on some sunscreen.Last November, after going through what I thought was my standard annual exam at the dermatologist's office-submit to a mole check, have one or two spots removed, receive a letter in the mail saying everything was fine-I got a call while at work informing me that my tests were in. One of the biopsies, a small patch of skin taken from between my shoulder blades, had tested positive for melanoma.The nurse on the phone recommended a surgical dermatologist and asked me to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I needed to move fast, she explained, as I hung up the phone and struggled to hold back my tears. Needless to say, I was terrified. I was also confused. As an otherwise healthy 26-year-old, I used to think skin cancer was something that happened after decades of excessive tanning. Born and raised in South America, I spent most of my life under the sun, never giving a thought to how much UV exposure I was getting. I felt angry at myself as I thought back to all those careless days spent on the beach, when my main concern had been what swimsuit to wear.  See more: 10 Best Beauty Secrets and TipsWith no time to waste, I set up an appointment with my new doctor. In less than a week, I had booked an excise surgery and had the melanoma (plus a significant portion of the surrounding skin) removed. All that was left after those frantic days were seventeen staples on my back and a newfound panic about the sun.In the months that followed, I learned that my story was not as unusual as I might have thought. Skin cancer, it turns out, is the fastest-rising form of cancer in the world, and melanoma is the most common type in young adults. Part of what makes melanoma so deadly is that it can easily and quickly spread to your lymph nodes and metastasize, which is why yearly screenings are key. ""Skin cancer is definitely on the rise for women,"" says New York City dermatologist Ellen Marmur, M.D., who attributes at least part of the phenomenon to an increasingly active lifestyle and, therefore, increased sun exposure.Thankfully, I was diligent about my yearly dermatologist appointments. When caught in its fledgling stages, the chances for a full recovery from skin cancer are around 95 percent. Still, my doctor warned me, I was going to have to be particularly careful about taking cover from the sun's harmful rays in the future. I took his advice too far at a friend's beach wedding a few months later, where I remained hidden under an umbrella in a tunic, while everyone else frolicked on the sand. There had to be a better way, I vowed on the flight home. Since then, I am happy to report, I have developed a new game plan with the help of the country's top dermatologists. Here, everything I've learned about navigating the summer months with success.LESSON #1: PLAY THE NUMBERS GAME Until recently, I rarely gave any thought to what kind of sunscreen I was buying-my only real criteria was picking anything with a SPF of 15 or higher. After my skin cancer scare, I was tempted to buy super sunblock (i.e. SPF 100), but I soon learned, the number on the bottle is only one part of the equation. ""SPF is what protects against sunburns"" and the UVB rays that cause them, explains Marmur. It does not indicate a formula's efficacy in protecting against UVA rays, which penetrate deeper under the skin's surface and cause suntanning, wrinkles, freckles-and the long-term DNA damage that has been linked to melanomas. An SPF of 30 or higher is best, but instead of fixating on the number, look for the words ""broad-spectrum"" on the bottle, which indicates protection against both harmful UVB and UVA rays.See more: 2013 Fashion Trends: Denim GuideLESSON #2: APPLY (AND REAPPLY!) SUNSCREEN REGULARLY Choosing the right sunscreen is crucial, but simply slathering myself in it before walking out the door isn't enough. Dr. Marmur recommends the following routine: ""Reapply every one to two hours. I tell my patients that before going outside, apply a lotion, because you have to give it time to dry. Then reapply throughout the day with a spray, because it's faster. And always have that sunscreen stick on hand, so you can redo your nose, mouth, and any spots you particularly worry about."" Sun-protective clothing is another smart and-thanks to chic young labels like Parasol and Mott 50-style-conscious way to prevent burning. There's also the antioxidant pill known as Heliocare. Although it's no replacement for sunscreen, it may help eliminate free radicals produced by sun exposure and limit sunburns, according to New York City dermatologist Neil Sadick, M.D., who is a supporter of the plant-based oral supplement.LESSON #3: BE DILIGENT ABOUT REGULAR MOLE CHECKS Now that I know how to properly protect myself outdoors, there are additional things I can do indoors to help prevent or detect another melanoma early. To start, I'll need to visit the dermatologist every three months. (For those who have not been diagnosed with a skin cancer previously, the Skin Cancer Foundation suggests an annual in-office mole check-combined with regular at-home self exams.) As for fair-skinned people like me, who've had multiple moles removed in the past, new noninvasive technologies such as MelaFind can increase the accuracy of a mole diagnosis, while reducing the number of biopsies that are performed (and hence the number of small scars covering one's body). ""It's a device that gives you a 3-D view of a mole through an imaging system, which you then scan through a database of typical and atypical moles to determine if you have a lower or higher probability of it being abnormal or benign,"" says Sadick, who uses the next-generation technology at his Park Avenue practice.LESSON #4: FAKE A HEALTHY GLOW With summer around the corner, protection is my first priority, but I would be lying if I didn't confess that I'm sad about being the pale girl in the sundress surrounded by a sea of bronzed bare legs. At one of my follow-up visits, I embarrassingly asked my doctor if self-tanners were out of the question, since he had mentioned right after my surgery that my skin tone-a wintery pasty shade-was to remain that color for the rest of my life. I'm happy to report a faux tan is still acceptable-well, at least according to my dermatologist-as long as I continue to apply my sunscreen diligently.See the slideshow at Vogue.com for our favorite summer sun-care products.See more from VOGUE: Best Met Gala Looks of All TimeMichelle Obama's Best-Dressed MomentsThe Great Gatsby: Behind the CostumesThe Sexiest You: Lingerie Guide "

The study was launched in 2005.Prior studies of this approach showed it cut infection rates by 44 percent in men who have sex with men, by 62 percent in heterosexual men and women and by 75 percent in couples in which one partner is infected with HIV and the other is not. The new results showed that it also protects intravenous drug users.""We now know that PrEP can work for all populations at increased risk for HIV,"" Mermin said in a statement.Based on the results, the CDC plans to recommend that U.S. doctors who wish to prescribe this treatment for their patients follow the same interim guidelines issued last year to prevent sexual transmission among other high-risk individuals.Intravenous use of drugs like heroin accounts for about 8 percent of all new HIV infections in the United States and about 10 percent of new HIV infections worldwide. In some regions, such as Eastern Europe and Central Asia, injection drug abuse accounts for about 80 percent of all new infections.The new findings involved more than 2,400 intravenous drug users in Bangkok who were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, and were being treated at the city's drug treatment clinics.Half took tenofovir and half took a placebo. All participants were given HIV prevention counseling, risk-reduction strategies such as condoms and methadone treatment, and monthly HIV testing.At the end of the study, there were 17 HIV infections among people taking the HIV medication, compared with 33 infections among those not taking the drugs, the researchers found.The researchers also looked to see what factors influenced infection rates among those taking the HIV medication. They found that people who took their medication at least 71 percent of the time had a 74 percent lower risk of becoming infected with HIV.Although it was not clear how the preventive drug treatment worked - by stopping infections caused by sharing dirty needles or by unprotected sex among drug users - the study produced a reduction in infection rates, said Dr. Salim Abdook Karim of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa and of Columbia University in New York.""The introduction of PrEP for HIV prevention in injecting drug users should be considered as an additional component to accompany other proven prevention strategies like needle exchange programs, methadone programs, promotion of safer sex and injecting practices, condoms, and HIV counseling and testing,"" Karim, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary accompanying the study in the Lancet.""PrEP as part of combination prevention in injecting drug users could make a useful contribution to the quest for an AIDS-free generation,"" Karim added."

Crushingly, his heart stopped ticking two months shy of his 62nd birthday and eight months before your parents' wedding, and I have faith he's watching over you from somewhere else, but I promise to share with you his ever-lasting humanity and grace that he blessed me with. I also hoped my big brother would be the one to show you how to master the bicycle kick to score as many goals as you can dream of, teach you the art of gliding the razor gently over your chin when you start to grow scruffy, and be around for guy questions that you'd rather have your underpants flying on a flag pole than ask your moms. Terrifyingly, a sudden fatal illness snapped him, a healthy 36-year-old, from us earlier this year, and it's up to me and the rest of our shrinking family to keep his memory alive for you and his two children. My dearest chickadees, I want you to know that although we may have lost the two most important men in my life, you are the two most important boys in my life. And you are beyond blessed with an amazing mother, a woman I am honored to share my life with. Your mama has achieved so much in terms of what's unfairly deemed ""masculine"" activities, from roofing and painting our house to building our expansive fence, digging each post hole by hand in a cold winter while you stayed warm in my belly to tiling our floors and maintaining our hardy plants and thriving garden. She can outpitch most guys her age in fast-pitch softball, and calculate and comprehend complex scientific and mathematic facts with her overachieving brain in a dizzying speed. Sweet dumplings, I promise you that you have all you need as parents from your mommy and mama. We will hold you close when you need holding close, but we will encourage you to fly from the nest when you're ready to soar. We will teach you to be kind and loving to every human being, paying no mind to their perceived race, gender or status level. In our two-mom home, your tender humanity which we've already witnessed with awe will be encouraged and tended to. You'll know how to court a girl or a boy, for friendship when you're young, and romance when you're older. But we do have men we hold close to our hearts, and for this we are humbly grateful. My father's brother, a highly educated man with a world of knowledge to share, holds two spots in his heart that burn brightly for you. And Mama comes from a large and wonderful family; this is where you get your passionate Italian personalities that (usually) delight us. Mama's passionate father, her brothers, brothers-in-law and nephews all love you deeply and will be there for you by and large, every step of the way as you grow from our precious little boys to leading men of the world. I promise you will have every opportunity to spend time with all of these men in our family, even though it will require more road trips and maneuvering of schedules. We want to do this for you. After your uncle passed away, I was devastated. Not only for what I lost, but for what you lost, as well. But I promise you that I have found as close to a replacement as I can in our friends and family who are interested in serving as your strong male role models. Because while your mother and I know that we can teach you almost everything there is to know about developing into strong and capable human beings, we also know that you're going to need male guidance along the way. And we promise to provide it for you by fostering and tending to relationships with men we believe possess the qualities we all can learn from. I love you more than anything in the world, my precious sons. I chose your mother nine years ago as my lifetime companion, knowing that I wanted to raise children with her because of her deep-rooted compassion for the world at large, her strong traditional family values, her work ethic, her charming good looks and because she can make me laugh until my sides hurt. When we married four years ago, we were eager to grow our family and share our cozy nest with a baby or two. We were ecstatic (OK, maybe Mama was a little frightened) when we learned our two babies were coming at once. Our hearts were jumping with joy (and a little anxiety) as we counted down the weeks until your arrival. And ever since you blessed us with your squeezable legs, shiny bright eyes and nearly edible button noses, our hearts have been melted in puddles on the floor. For everything that you have given us with your two years of life -- from belly laughs to raucous delight to surprise food flying high in the air to sleepless nights to warm neck nuzzles to developing your fascinating language skills from ""goo goo gaga"" to ""more oatmeal, please"" to reminding us that family, a group of two or more human beings who love each other fiercely, is what life is all about, for all of this, my sons, I promise to give you back tenfold. You will never know a day that you are not loved, wanted and accepted unconditionally. This I promise you.Love,  MommyThis post originally appeared on equallyfamily.com, a modern parenting site for diverse families."
