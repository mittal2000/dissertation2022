Monarch Beverages in Indianapolis runs or supports about a dozen wellness programs. The company spends about $100,000 annually on them, and human resources vice president Natalie Roberts swears they make back every penny.

Those programs are expected to expand next year when provisions of the Affordable Care Act that encourage obesity prevention kick in.Weight Watchers has seen its revenue dip in the first half of the year as it struggles to convince cost-conscious dieters to pay $18.95 a month for an online subscription when they have access to free or inexpensive weight loss apps on their phones.""It's been an ongoing struggle to try and differentiate themselves from those apps,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Kurt Frederick.Some of the apps even rival Weight Watchers' edge in providing a supportive community to help with weight loss. The free, calorie-counting app My Fitness Pal, for example, has an active forum online.Weight Watchers Chief Financial Officer Nicholas Hotchkin told analysts the calorie-counting apps can't compare to the company's holistic approach to weight loss, which advocates for lifestyle and behavioral changes. But it certainly has shed some revenue. Last week, it reported second-quarter revenue down 4 percent to $465.1 million. Shares plunged. They closed on Thursday at $37.57, almost 21 percent lower than a month ago.But Weight Watchers' partnership with companies eager to slim down their employees was a bright spot. Experts say employee weight-loss programs are good for worker productivity and employee retention.Weight Watchers' workforce division might be a small piece of the diet pie for now, but revenue for its partnership with large employers grew about 30 percent this quarter. Regional partnerships, with small employers, saw a 1 percent decline in sales. The company has remained tight-lipped on exact details of the division's results and declined to make an executive available to discuss them.Called Health Solutions, the division partners with corporations to create incentive programs that range from partially subsidizing Weight Watchers program fees for employees to giving employees a discount on health insurance if they attend a certain amount of meetings, said Susan Craig, a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers.She added employees can also attend Weight Watchers meetings in their office, or use online tools customizable to the company.American Express and the New York Stock Exchange Euronext are among the companies using Weight Watchers.Newly appointed CEO James Chambers, who replaced David Kirchhoff, said on a recent conference call with analysts that he has seen strong interest in the marketplace. The company, he said, plans to commit more resources to the workforce division.But for now, Health Solutions remains small and cannot yet offset any losses inflicted by mobile competitors. Frederick estimated the workplace wellness programs likely make up less than 5 percent of sales, compared to the meetings and the online business.The potential market is growing. Some 86 percent of the 120 U.S. companies surveyed offer wellness-based incentive programs, according to a survey by Fidelity Investments and the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit representing large employers' perspective on health policy. That's up from 57 percent in 2009.But employers are not required to report their participation in these programs, so it is hard to gather exact data, said Harald Schmidt, a research associate at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics. Weight loss programs are still a minority of those programs, he said.LuAnn Heinen, vice president of the National Business Group on Health, said the healthcare reform could create buzz and spur further implementation of employee wellness programs. The programs have been growing in popularity for at least five years.""Large employers are already really interested in doing this,"" she said. ""For smaller and midsize employers, this could drive them into doing this.""The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will raise the incentive level caps to 30 percent to allow employers to reward healthy employees with lower insurance premiums, or penalize unhealthy workers with higher premiums.Most employers are still far from the current cap of offering incentives at 20 percent, and it is more common for employers to raise premiums on smokers than overweight workers, Heinen said.Weight Watchers will have little competition in the workforce sphere, Frederick said, adding it is more attractive to employers than weight loss programs like Jenny Craig, which offers participants frozen healthy meals.Food delivery would be more expensive for employers to subsidize, he said. A Jenny Craig year-long membership can cost $359, plus the cost of the food, which averages about $18 a day.Another advantage: employers want to use weight loss programs that are clinically tested and proven, Heinen said. ""Weight Watchers is the most significant stand-alone brand, and the most requested by employees by miles."" (Reporting By Madeline Will; Editing by Jilian Mincer and Leslie Gevirtz)"

Perhaps he was examining the Koi in the fishpond, waiting for one to poke his head out so that he could enjoy a swift breakfast. When he heard me, he turned and with a great flap of his wide wings leapt onto the thatched roof of the open bale, then in a single hop took off over the palm trees.It made me realize that so much of Bali remains unseen to most of our tourist eyes. The reason I was up at dawn was that a mosquito was biting me under the covers, a feat I am still not sure how it was possible to accomplish. A few minutes later just as I was drifting back onto the other side of the dawn, I heard an unfamiliar sound. It was the low roar of the fog machines which spray a chemical smoke to kill off most of the mosquito population. I've slept through it every other time they've come through, so I don't know how often that happens, but it is imperative to keep the insects under control. I, who prefer to keep all chemicals out of my body, was dismayed that the hotel staff could not tell me what chemicals are used in the noxious concoction, but we take so many of these things for granted. In fact, last night I watch them smoke the lobby during dinner hour, and most people didn't even bother to move away. Yesterday, we had a speaker come to our group meeting, the founder of Fair Future Foundation, which supplies health care for free to the indigenous Balinese. In the middle of his speech, he mentioned that the free education to Balinese children receive is not free, the free doctors visits that supposedly are offered by the government are not actually free. That the Balinese pay for everything themselves, all on a salary that would make an American McDonald's worker blush.I don't mean to have white man's guilt, or rich man's burden. I am not attempting to lecture those of us who can afford to visit Bali on avoiding its beauty in favor of a seedy underbelly. What I am interested in is how much goes unseen before our eyes. Whether it is the Egret walking around my pool while I sleep cozy in my bed or the family of white street dogs who steal water from the decorate mall fountain, so much goes unnoticed unless we are willing to pay attention. In becoming more aware, in choosing to take more notice of my surroundings and my experiences beyond the first impression, I can bring more balance and choice into my life. I can donate money to help Balinese schoolchildren, I can leave bread out for the birds, or I can do nothing. But at least I know.Join Spirit Quest Tours on our upcoming Eat, Pray, Love tour to Bali in October by visiting www.spiritquesttours.com/eatpraylovePhotos by Spirit Quest Tours"

I have nothing against her and in fact I’m very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier,"" he said.Douglas went on to say that he believes marriage counselors work to keep marriages going -- even if it is clear that they should end -- in order to stay in business.“It took me too long to realize that if you go to a marriage counselor to resolve problems, it’s in his interest to keep the marriage going. Because if I end the marriage he’s got no business,"" he said. ""I think Diandra would probably say the same thing. That’s the only clear regret that I have.”After finalizing his divorce in June 2000, Douglas married current wife Catherine Zeta Jones that same year in November.

Litwin, of La Palette fame, has released a cookbook that is available on iTunes.

During July's heat wave, even the simple act of grilling became unpleasant. While we often fight over who gets to man the barbecue, neither one of us wanted to leave the cool confines of our apartment to stand over an open flame in 100-degree weather. Preferring to eat at home as much as we can, we realized that the best way to beat the heat is to work as many un-cooked dishes as possible into our dinner repertoire. Although we rarely lack inspiration in the kitchen, we turned to our cookbook shelf for a little help in finding dishes that are delicious, beautiful to look at, and require either no cooking at all or a single cooked item, such as a boiled egg or blanched green beans. The bounty of summer produce available at farmers markets tilts our diet towards the vegetarian end of the spectrum, at least until fall sets in and we start craving heavier fare. Here are some of our favorite finds to help beat summer's heat. The Gotham Bar and Grill Greenmarket to Gotham Recipe Journal by Chef Alfred Portale: (HauteLife, 2013) Since it opened in 1984, Gotham Bar and Grill has ranked among New York's finest restaurants, and Chef Portale was one of the first chefs to utilize the Union Square Greenmarket as a source of seasonal produce. This slim volume is organized by seasonality of the fruits and vegetables, and offers profiles of area farmers as well as wine pairings for each dish. The gorgeous photographs will immediately inspire you to head for the nearest farmers market to stock up on whatever is freshest and finest this week. Among the many no-cook offerings are Strawberry and Baby Arugula Salad, 12 East 12 Vegetable Salad, and Summer Melon Salad. No Bake Makery by Cristina Suarez Krumsick (Grand Central, 2013) Just because we're not turning on the oven doesn't mean we have to skip dessert! The lengthy subtitle of this fun cookbook, ""More than 80 two-bite treats made with lovin', not an oven,"" nicely summarizes its theme but barely does it justice. Krumsick got bit by the no-bake bug when her NYC oven failed to bake cookies in under two hours during a Christmas party, but her evolution from home hostess to caterer to author has allowed her to experiment with a multitude of dessert styles. There is some cooking involved--usually melting chocolate or making caramel--but the majority of the work involves mixing, shaping, and drizzling. There is a surprising variety of bite-sized treats between the covers, including Strawberry Nutella Icebox Cake, Marshmallow Pretzel Bars, and Pink Velvet Cheesecake. Food: Vegetarian Home Cooking by Mary McCartney (Sterling Epicure, 2013) The daughter of one of the first well-known celebrity vegetarian couples (Paul and Linda McCartney), photographer Mary McCartney has compiled a collection of recipes that could make even the staunchest carnivore drool. Adaptations of family recipes and McCartney's insight into each dish are interspersed with mouth-watering photography showcasing both finished dishes and the natural beauty of raw ingredients. Well-organized chapters bring us from breakfast and brunch straight through lunch, dinner, and dessert, with a nice balance of ""spa cuisine"" and vegetarian twists on classic comfort food. The majority of no-cook entrees are found in the ""Snacks and Sandwiches"" and ""Soups, Salads, and Starters"" chapters, but we also have our eye on Mary's Ice Cream Celebration Cake. The Rawvolution Continues by Matt and Janabai Amsden (Atria, 2013) Founders of LA's Euphoria Loves RAWvolution and NY's RAWvolution Café, Matt and Janabai Amsden are at the forefront of the modern raw food movement. More than just a cookbook, The Rawvolution Continues delves into the philosophy and health benefits of eating uncooked foods, and offers readers advice on which spices, seeds, and condiments they will need to stock their raw kitchen. The list of appliances required doesn't involve anything hotter than a food dehydrator with a maximum temperature of 105 F; you will be using your blender, food processor, and juicer a lot as well if you plan to ""cook"" your way through this one. There is an entire section on shakes and smoothies, and we are especially taken with some of the dishes that make us sweat a little, like Spicy Chipotle Burgers and Szechuan Noodles made with raw zucchini ""pasta."""

As you squeeze through walls of rock in an inflatable raft on a chute of whitewater, you might experience the nirvana that tourists did back in the '70s -- the 1870s, that is -- when larger wooden boats were pulled back into place through an elaborate pulley system. You can see the rusty remnants as you travel down rough and calm water (FYI: you will get wet). The boats may have changed, but the grandeur has not and it's certainly worth the 40-minute drive from Lake Placid. If you've got only a couple of hours, opt for the ""Classic Tour"" $28.95, which includes access to the one mile intermediate trail that descends into the chasm and a one mile river raft ride. Open all year, boat and tube rides seasonal. Snowshoe tours in winter.VISIT: North Star Underground Railroad, Ausable Chasm. After trekking through Ausable Chasm, stop in to the small house next door (this museum shares a parking lot) to learn about the part this region played in the Underground Railroad. Exhibits showcase one fugitive slave, John Thomas, who made the arduous journey on foot through Philadelphia to Troy, N.Y., on his way to the U.S. border. Like many runaway slaves, Thomas stayed in upstate New York due to the generosity of one man -- the abolitionist Garret Smith, who gave away 120,000 acres to more than 3,000 escaped slaves, granting them the land-ownership required to vote in New York. Thomas not only succeeded in working the hardscrabble land but, unlike most of his brethren, prospered and bought 200 acres here. In 1872, Thomas wrote a letter of gratitude to Smith, which was lost for over a century and just recently rediscovered. Open daily May-Oct 9-5. Free, but donations appreciated.DRIVE/HIKE: Whiteface Veterans' Memorial Highway. Pay the toll, and then climb the first road to honor American Veterans, a Works Project built during the Roosevelt administration and dedicated by FDR in 1935. Follow a long, riffled-tarred road with pullouts from which to ogle a more than grand tableau, but save your best ogling for the summit of Whiteface, the fifth highest peak in the Adirondacks. Park near the tourist center then walk through a 427-foot long dark, wet tunnel to a 27-story elevator that goes right through rock to the tippy-top of the mountain. Mid May to Mid October 9-4, $10 for car and driver, $7 for each additional person.VISIT: High Falls Gorge. This stunning attraction-that-could was destroyed twice in 2011 (once due to excessive snow melt, then months later from Hurricane Irene). Back better than ever, marvel at the force of water down and through rock on a half-mile multi-level series of paths, stairs and bridges. Afterwards, sample local wines at the new beer and wine bar in back of the gift shop. It's only $3 for three one-ounce sips. May-Oct Daily 9-5, Dec. - March daily 9-4:30; $10.95 adults, $7.95 kids. Winter Waterfall & Snowshoe Package $26 adults, $16 kids including offsite rentals all day.VISIT: John Brown Farm and Gravesite. Though John Brown spent only a few weeks in Elba, N.Y., before traveling to Kentucky to join his sons in their fight against slavery, and then put to death for his role in the raid on the U.S. Arsenal in Harper's Ferry, Va., he asked to be buried ""by the big rock"" on this bucolic property. Brown's headstone is inscribed: ""Executed, Charleston, VA, Dec. 2, 1859,"" and he is buried with his sons Oliver, killed during the raid, and Watson, wounded and died as ""John Doe"" 18 hours later. Open May1-Oct 31 Wed-Mon (closed Tues) 10-5. $2 adults, under 12 free. Grounds and grave open year round during daylight hours.VISIT: Historic Saranac Laboratory, Saranac Lake. When Dr. Edward Trudeau contracted tuberculosis in the late 1870s, he moved to the brisk-aired mountains of the Adirondacks to die. But strange thing is -- he didn't die, and so believing that he had stumbled onto a cure, Trudeau enticed those with the disease up to Saranac Lake in 1884. This first Sanatorium eventually became a town-wide industry; thousands of young adults (average age 18 to 35) came for ""the cure"" and stayed an average of two years. In the 1890s, Dr. Trudeau established the first laboratory to study the insidious disease. With no electricity when it was built, architects relied on large windows to allow for maximum light, and now, this is what is most striking about the tile-walled lab, refurbished to the way it would have looked at the turn of last century and opened as a tourist attraction in 2009. The Trudeau Institute (currently located elsewhere in Saranac Lake), continues to break ground in medical research. Dr. Edward Trudeau's son and grandson, both doctors, carried on his work in town and his great-grandson, the Doonesbury cartoonist Gary Trudeau, still visits Saranac Lake on occasion. Open year-round Tues-Fri. 10am-3pm. $5. TOUR: Lake Placid Boat Tour. Tours leave from the only public and fuel dock on Lake Placid, and covers nearly all of the five-by-two-and-a-half-mile lake. The narrated one-hour trip features stories about the surrounding topography, Adirondack architecture (slight Japanese influence with rooflines like pagodas and use of natural materials), seasonal homeowners, and the ""camps"" that are camps the way Harry Winston is a jewelry store. Mid May to Mid October - see website for schedule; $15 adults, $10 kids.EAT: Eat 'N Meet Grill and Larder, Saranac Lake. Can you find culinary genius in a '50s-style corner grocery store? Yes, if it's in Saranac Lake, where you'll find John Vargo charring Brussels sprouts ($4) to crispy-creamy perfection. Order these morsels of deliciousness, along with other twists-on-standards (like the Vegetarian Burger Reuben $10, huge enough to share), and if possible, call ahead -- this is good slow food, so expect to wait at least 30 minutes.EAT: Liquids and Solids, Lake Placid. Getting through the beer list is an endurance test, but a joyful one in this roadside café where craft brews with names like Mother's Milk Stout and Deveiant Dale's IPA get their own ""tasting notes."" Chefs lavish farm-to-fork attention on menu items that change daily and ""are smaller than most Americans are used to,"" says one server. In other words, just the right size. So, ""Tempura Asparagus"" ($11) consists of several whole lightly battered spears lying on a bed of piquant fresh garden greens. EAT: Freestyle Cuisine, Lake Placid. A stellar addition to the culinary scene, the restaurant is split in two dining rooms -- one colorfully stylized to the max, another, with rustic booths facing an open kitchen,where verdant greens, artfully presented dishes, and creative victuals like Lobster Corn Dog ($14) and Foie Gras Burger with Truffle Mayo ($17) are garnering rave reviews. STAY: Dartbrook Lodge, Keene. As a rule, you won't find boutique design in rustic roadside cabins. But The Dartbrook Lodge, which elevates ""classic rustic design"" to boutique hotel standards, breaks that rule entirely. Right on Route 73, current owners Steve Pounian and Jay Haws, with backgrounds in design, completely remodeled each cabin in Great Camp style and reopened the lodge in 2009. While sourcing locally made furniture and accessories, Pounian and Haws established relationships with Adirondack artisans and began to collect and sell their products at the neighboring shop Dartbrook Rustic Goods -- a terrific balsam-scented emporium. Because of the lodge's roadside location, you'll pay a fraction of what you'd have to fork over for a comparable space a few miles away on Lake Placid. Ask for the apartment-sized Halcyon House; log plank walls, Sleep Number bed, rustic/luxe and beautiful décor extends to the slate floor bathroom; the glass and bluestone double rain shower is downright glorious and could find a home in any upscale hotel. All this for less than $200 per night. Cabins $175-$195 per night.STAY: Interlaken Inn, Lake Placid; Tucked on a side street uphill from Mirror Lake, the Interlaken is that great blend of casual elegance, phenomenal food, unsurpassed bar and comfortably classy antique-stuffed rooms that don't cost an arm and a leg, even ""in season."" Owners Mary and John Nealy believe that guests should enjoy luxury without having to pay outlandish rates. What is bliss? It's being served your favorite wine while being warmed by a huge blazing fireplace as snow falls outside the window, and knowing that your room is just upstairs. $175 to $275 per night.For more recommendations on the best attractions, restaurants and lodging in the Northeast USA, trust in the Getaway Mavens!"
