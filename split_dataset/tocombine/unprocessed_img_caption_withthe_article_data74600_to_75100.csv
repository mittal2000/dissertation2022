0,SCIENCE,Scientist Featured On 'Humans Of New York' Can Put Your Immune System Into A Mouse's Body,Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nichole-danzi-immunology_us_562e2983e4b0443bb5646b3c,We caught up with Nichole Danzi to talk about her work on autoimmunity.,2015-10-26,This mouse likely has a normal mouse immune system.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562e5caa1400002b003c91f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Humans of New York, the popular blog that uses images of New Yorkers to create a photographic census of the city, featured a scientist last week who caught our eye: She can put your entire immune system into the body of a mouse!As she put it to Humans of New York, “I can take your immune system and transplant it into a mouse that I’ve genetically engineered to have no immune system of it’s [sic] own, so that I can model the genetics of your immune system and find immunoregulatory defects that will determine how you are going to respond to the cellular therapy needed to treat your disease.” ""That's a super hero right there,"" said one commenter on the Humans of New York Instagram account. The blog never reveals the names of its subjects, but we tracked her down: She's Nichole Danzi, an associate research scientist at Columbia University's Center for Translational Immunology. We talked to her about her work and how she became interested in this field. Unfortunately, she wouldn't disclose whether she has transferred her own immune system to any of the mice.Below is a lightly edited and condensed transcript of our discussion.When and how did it become possible to transplant the immune system of a human into a mouse?Xenografting refers to the transplantation of cells from one species into another species ... In 2002, a strain of mice known as ‘NSG’ became available, which allows for the best engraftment and growth of human cells. These mice are used extensively by biomedical researchers to study human tumors, and in our lab at the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, we use NSG mice to study the development of human immune systems.It is relatively easy to take mature human blood cells from an adult and inject them into NSG mice. The human blood cells circulate and persist in these mice for a limited period of time. But T cells in the human immune cell graft will quickly recognize the mouse host as foreign and mount an attack. To prevent this graft versus host reaction, we grow the human immune system in mice from the ground up, starting from the most immature blood stem cells. To allow a functioning and self-tolerant immune system to develop, we must also surgically implant a piece of human thymus into the mouse. The thymus is like a classroom for T cells. The thymus contains highly specialized cells that foster T cell maturation from stem cells and selects/educates T cells that will react against foreign but not self molecules.It turns out that preparation of the thymus tissue was the key to the success of the model, and we developed a method to cryopreserve and recover the tissue. In 2012 we published a series of experiments showing how to take stem cells from an adult’s bone marrow and essentially recreate that human’s immune system in NSG mice. These ‘personalized immune’ mice have B cells and T cells that are tolerant to cells from the mouse host and human donor, but can react against foreign molecules.Do you have a mouse with your own immune system in it?I can’t comment on this specific question. I can say that the principal investigator of my lab, Megan Sykes, was the first person to donate bone marrow and her blood stem cells did create mice with her immune system in them. In these early stages of the project she referred to the mouse model as the ‘mini-me’ model. With further discussion and input from a journal editor we changed the name to the ‘Personalized Immune Mouse,' as this was more accurate in describing the model.Tell me a little about your background. How did you get into this particular field?As a graduate student I studied the development of the thymus -- an organ that sits just above your heart and gradually involutes as you age. Within the thymus, immature T cells progressively mature, and as they mature they are carefully selected to react against foreign molecules and not self. This education/selection process is called central tolerance. Defects in this selection process lead to autoimmune disease. In my graduate studies, I exclusively used mouse models to study T cell and thymus development. You can learn a lot from studying the development of mouse immune systems.However, I wanted to delve into the complexity of human immunology where individual variation in genetic makeup and environment all contribute to differences in immune function. The overarching purpose of my research at CCTI is to understand how tolerance becomes broken in patients with autoimmune diseases. The Personalized Immune Mouse Model that we developed combines strategies of central and peripheral tolerance induction and allows study of the genetic lesions that drive autoimmunity in humans.What’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced in your work?There was a steep learning curve as I transitioned from a basic researcher working exclusively with mice to a translational researcher where the research makes a direct connection with human patients. Our human subjects all agree to undergo genetic testing and a bone marrow biopsy. Control subjects must be genetically matched to patients with autoimmunity. We need to coordinate the busy schedules of our human donors with stem cell isolation procedures in our lab and delicate surgeries in our mice. In addition to the logistics, the ethical and regulatory issues surrounding this project are complex.Having the direct connection to human patients, however, has been more rewarding than it has been challenging. If you look at many of the comments on the Humans of New York posting, you see that individuals who struggle with autoimmunity view this type of personalized research model as an important way forward in understanding their health problems.Powered by funding from the [The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases], we have developed specialized resources for housing, grafting, post-op care and analysis of the personalized immune mice at the CCTI. Besides being surrounded by a highly skilled team of scientists at the CCTI, I’m very privileged to work with an awesome clinical team, first at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and, more recently, in the rheumatology division. Our clinical collaborators have helped foster sensitivity, a real sense of purpose and connection to the individuals dealing with chronic disease and to all of the volunteers which participate in the study. As you can imagine, without a fully supportive clinical and research team, this type of study would not be possible.What’s next for this research? Is there a particular goal you’d like to see accomplished?Most autoimmune diseases have an important but complex genetic component. Each human with autoimmune disease has a unique set of genetically encoded traits that, by an unknown mechanism, disrupts regulation of the immune system to tip the balance from self-tolerance to autoimmunity.Right now, we are trying to understand the underlying immunoregulatory problems in patients with Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. For our study, we need to basically take blood stem cells from the bone marrow of patients and healthy controls and use them to ‘reboot’ these individuals’ immune systems in the NSG mice. We then study the developing human immune systems in these mice over time and try to identify a specific immunoregulatory dysfunction that may have contributed to the disease. Unlike the human donors, the immune populations in the mice are not affected by disease or a lifetime of treatment.Ultimately, I would like to see these personalized immune mice actively participating in patient care. We have much more work to do before we get to this point, but perhaps some day a specific immune dysfunction identified in a patient’s mouse might suggest a particular mode of immunotherapy or small molecule therapy."

2,POLITICS,Bacon May Soon Come With A Warning Label In California,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bacon-warning-label_us_562e5adfe4b0c66bae58ac15,So will all processed and red meats.,2015-10-26,The World Health Organization on Monday announced it was classifying processes meats and red meats as carcinogens. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562e84a21400002200c7adc3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bacon lovers, it may not be easy to brush off the World Health Organization's new ruling that red and processed meats cause cancer -- at least not in California. Following WHO's Monday announcement classifying processed meats -- such as bacon, sausage, hot dogs and ham -- and red meats -- including beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse and goat -- as carcinogens, California should now require those products sold in the state to carry a warning label in accordance with Proposition 65, says the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity. “The World Health Organization has put these meats in the same category as cigarettes in terms of the death and danger they deliver,” Stephanie Feldstein, population and sustainability director with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post. “Now, California must follow suit with public health warnings on the label. And it’s no surprise: the science has been clear that these meats are bad for people, not to mention for wildlife and the planet.”Prop 65, passed in 1986, requires California to create a state list of all chemicals and substances identified by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer as ""carcinogenic to humans,"" the most dangerous level, which processed meats fall under; ""probably carcinogenic to humans ... with sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals,"" the second-most dangerous level, which red meat falls under; and ""possibly carcinogenic to humans ... with sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals."" Businesses, the law notes, are required to provide a ""clear and reasonable"" warning before exposing anyone to a listed substance.The warning may be in the form of a label on the meat's packaging, a sign or menu notation where the meat is sold or ""a system of signs, public advertising identifying the system and toll-free information services,"" the law states. The California attorney general's office, which is tasked with enforcing Prop 65, did not immediately return HuffPost's request for comment on how WHO's announcement will affect meat labeling in California.Also on HuffPost:"

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), specifically takes issue with the SSA giving legally married gay and lesbian couples incorrect payouts after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, then fining them.While the agency worked to update its policies following the court's decision, the SSA continued to treat people in same-sex marriages as single individuals, resulting in higher benefit payouts. Now, the SSA wants those couples to pay it back.The letter highlights the experiences of Hugh Held and Kelley Richardson-Wright, who are both in same-sex marriages in California. More than a year after the Supreme Court's decision, they each received letters from the SSA informing them they'd received about $6,200 and $4,100 more, respectively, than they were entitled to, and would have to reimburse the agency for the overpayment. (After Held and Richardson-Wright took the matter to court, the SSA opted to waive their penalty.)""We are concerned to hear that, for some time after the Supreme Court's Windsor decision, SSA continued to issue benefits to Supplemental Security Income recipients in same-sex marriages as though these individuals were single, and that for some SSI recipients, SSA is still doing so,"" the letter reads.""SSA should not penalize people who are poor, elderly or disabled because SSA continued issuing benefits to these married individuals as though they were single,"" it continues. ""According to SSA's statute and regulations, SSA shall avoid penalizing an individual for overpayment if the individual is without fault and if recovery of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience.""The letter asks the SSA to provide a count of how many individuals in same-sex marriages it has charged with overpayment, and what the agency has done to update its own systems ""so that SSA can correctly take marital status into account and administer benefits fairly to all individuals.""

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says the presidential candidate believes that ""working people are key ... to what kind of economy we're going to have.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a rare move for a major presidential candidate, Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) joined a picket line with Verizon workers in New York City on Monday. The decision to single out a major U.S. corporation by joining a worker protest is unusual for a serious presidential contender in the midst of a campaign. Sanders' camp believes the last major Democratic candidate to do so would have been Jesse Jackson in 1988.“Let me get to the point,” Sanders said at the Monday picket line, which took place at a Verizon Wireless store in midtown Manhattan. “Middle class in this country is disappearing and what Verizon is doing to their workers is exactly what has got to be fought if we are going to rebuild the American middle class.”""What this campaign is about is that corporate America can't have it all,"" he added.Nearly 40,000 Verizon employees represented by Communications Workers of America union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are currently in a major contract battle with Verizon. CWA has also accused the telecom giant of retaliating against Verizon Wireless store employees who are union activists, charges that the company has denied. Rich Young, a Verizon spokesman, said the company has been working since June to reach a ""solid contract"" with the workers, and he accused CWA of ""distort[ing] facts.""""These PR stunts do nothing to help advance the bargaining process,"" Young told The Huffington Post, which is owned by Verizon. ""Verizon remains ready to hold serious discussions and engage in meaningful negotiations that will result in a fair and balanced agreement. We truly hope union leaders are soon committed to the same.""While it may be unusual for a presidential candidate to join a picket line, it isn't unusual for the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont. Last year, before he declared his presidential bid, Sanders walked a picket line with workers at the telecom company FairPoint Communications, where 1,700 employees represented by IBEW were on strike in New England. He also marched with the Bakers, Confectioners, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union Local 100G in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last month.""This is what we should demand of candidates who say they're for working people -- that they take a stand and that they're proud to do it,"" said Larry Cohen, a Sanders adviser. Cohen previously served as the longtime president of the CWA.In a blog post at The Huffington Post on Monday, Cohen quoted from a message Sanders sent to Verizon employees in August, shortly before their contract expired: ""I am hopeful you will reach a fair contract. But if you run into roadblocks, as in years past, know that I will be there with you until a fair contract is negotiated.""Sanders' long-running, vocal support for organized labor helps explain his appeal to many rank-and-file union members during the primary, even as frontrunner Hillary Clinton picks up more endorsements from establishment labor unions. Both candidates have placed economic inequality at the core of their campaigns as they seek the nomination, though it's much harder to imagine Clinton walking a picket line aimed at a telecom giant. ""Bernie believes that working people are key -- their standard of living, their jobs -- to what kind of economy we're going to have,"" Cohen said. ""And that needs to be front and center and not something you get into obliquely.""This post has been updated with comments from Verizon.Also on HuffPost:"
5,ENTERTAINMENT,Donald Trump Takes Aim At Rivals' Super PAC Support,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-super-pac-2016_us_562e6694e4b00aa54a4a8544,The billionaire says other candidates are breaking the law.,2015-10-26,Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called on his rivals to disavow their support from super PACs and other outside groups.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562e68171400002200c7ad67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Billionaire eccentric and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday called on all presidential candidates to disavow support they receive from super PACs.In a series of tweets, Trump called the unlimited-money super PACs a “scam” and wrote, “All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s. They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself.”Every Republican presidential candidate has received support from a super PAC or a non-disclosing nonprofit. For most of the candidates, their super PAC has raised more money than their actual campaign. Trump had super PACs backing him until Friday, when he disavowed all super PACs formed to support his candidacy. This move came days after a pro-Trump super PAC shut down after The Washington Post reported on its close connection to the Trump campaign.Super PACs were created in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and a subsequent lower court ruling -- SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission -- opened the door to unlimited election spending by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals so long as it remained independent from candidates.The independence imagined by the court, however, is riddled with loopholes that have increasingly allowed candidates to help create, raise money for, staff and influence super PACs supporting them with relative ease.Republican presidential candidates including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former candidate Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin all pretended to not be running for president to evade laws prohibiting them from coordinating with their super PACs.This evasion enabled Bush to raise $100 million for his Right to Rise super PAC directly from wealthy donors and corporations. Many of these big donors have lobbying interests in Washington.Jindal was able to raise millions for a super PAC, a 527 and a nonprofit supporting his campaign. The majority of the disclosed money to the super PAC and 527 came from donors who have benefited from Jindal’s administration or who still have business before him. Donors to Jindal’s nonprofit are not disclosed -- a practice known as “dark money.”Kasich not only raised money for and coordinated directly with his super PAC almost up to the moment he announced his candidacy, but he also cut advertisements for it. Candidates are technically legally prohibited from making advertisements with super PACs.Mike Murphy, the head of Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC, criticized Kasich’s appearance in super PAC ads in an interview with Bloomberg. “We're far more conservative than the Kasich people; they're doing stuff our lawyers would never allow, so but it's open to interpretation,” Murphy said.Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is leaning heavily on her super PAC to manage many of the day-to-day tasks of a normal campaign. The group does advance work on her public appearances, has hosted conference calls for her and does a lot of the communications work normally done by a traditional campaign.The other candidates are all boosted by outside groups as well. A quartet of super PACs backing Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) raised a combined $38.6 million. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) is backed by a super PAC that raised $17.3 million and a dark money nonprofit that has reportedly raised more than $18 million in undisclosed donations. A super PAC supporting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has pulled in $14.4 million. (All totals are from January through June.)Trump’s declaration that the super PACs used by these candidates are illegal may not be so far-fetched. Campaign finance reform advocates Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center have already asked the Department of Justice to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Bush’s relationship with his super PAC.Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center allege that Bush is in violation of a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (popularly known as McCain-Feingold) that bans outside groups from acting on a candidate’s behalf if said group was created by or with the help of the candidate and the group raised money above the candidate donation limit of $5,400 per donor.“[T]here are powerful grounds to believe that both Bush and the Right to Rise Super PAC are violating these prohibitions and, in so doing, that they are engaged in a scheme to allow unlimited contributions to be spent directly on behalf of the Bush campaign and thereby violate the candidate contribution limits enacted to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption,” the legal request by the two groups states.Despite his protestations of independence from big money, campaign finance reformers do not see Trump as a fix for the money-in-politics problem. According to Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer, Trump’s self-funded campaign is just another example of a broken system and his attacks on big money are just self-interested politics.“Trump is using these statements as a weapon to attack his Republican primary opponents and the individual candidate Super PACs that are spending unlimited money to support them,” Wertheimer wrote. “But there is no evidence that Trump himself is a reformed sinner interested in fixing the system.”"

Asaro, who was charged with taking part in the 1978 airport heist that helped inspire the Mafia movie ""Goodfellas,"" was found not guilty today in a Brooklyn federal courtroom. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58588ebc1c000011070ec84f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- If not for a burnt-out and broke low-level gangster, it's quite possible that the biggest cash robbery in American history would have remained an open case. The crime in question is the infamous 1978 Lufthansa heist, in which a team of mobsters and their cronies snatched $6 million in cash and jewels from JFK airport in Queens, New York, an event later immortalized in Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas."" The man accused of co-masterminding the armed robbery is Vincent Asaro, a mid-level Mafioso whose gambling problem ate up his share of the heist, according to prosecutors. Asaro, now 80, sat in federal court in Brooklyn last week for the start of his trial for racketeering, robbery, extortion and other crimes. The indictment includes the alleged 1969 murder of Paul Katz. Asaro has pleaded not guilty. ""Vincent Asaro is not a name that anyone would really know,"" said Robert Sberna, who writes about organized crime, including the Lufthansa robbery. ""But he's an old-school Mafia guy who's going to go down fighting."" If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. The government's star witness is Asaro's cousin, Gaspare Valenti, who ratted out Asaro because he was broke due to his own gambling losses. Valenti went to the FBI in 2008 and began wearing a wire that would eventually allow him to capture Asaro griping about his share of the cut from the Lufthansa job.“We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get. We got fucked all round,"" Asaro said on tape, according to The Guardian. Asaro reportedly netted $500,000 from the robbery but squandered most of it at the track.Despite the scope of the robbery, experts said that solving the crime wasn't a priority until Valenti made it easy for the feds. There were squabbles among the mobsters about splitting the jackpot, even though it was millions more than they expected to reap. Many of the people involved in the Lufthansa robbery have since been killed, but jurors cannot hear about them, because Asaro isn't accused of taking part in their deaths. Asaro is a holdover from another era, according to experts like Capeci and Sberna. The Mafia motto ""death before dishonor"" is reportedly tattooed on his arm. His father and grandfather were wiseguys too, and his son, Jerome, got indicted in 2014 at the same time he did.Though still operational, the Bonanno family is a shell of its former self, according to Sberna. The organization no longer has the same kind of muscle from labor unions, bookmaking and drug dealing that it once did.The interest in this trial is therefore more as a history lesson than as a direct attack on the mob's influence. ""The only impact this is going to have is on Vinny Asaro,"" said Jerry Capeci, a veteran reporter and former Huffington Post blogger who run the website Gangland News. ""It's not going to make the Bonanno family any weaker than it is now."" The Scorsese flick doesn't portray Asaro, but it does prominently feature his partner in organizing the Lufthansa robbery. That would be Jimmy ""The Gent"" Burke, played in the film by none other than Robert De Niro. Valenti testified about the directions he allegedly received from Asaro, who didn't take part in the actual robbery. ""This sheds light on a legendary, iconic story,"" said Capeci. The case ""was on no one's radar"" before Valenti approached the FBI with information, he said. Burke and many of the other people who had a role in the heist have been dead for years. But a number of ex-mobsters, including Joseph Massina, a former Bonanno family boss turned government informant, are expected to testify in Asaro's case.The defense for Asaro has tried undermining the credibility of the government's witnesses. They hope jurors will not trust witnesses like Valenti, who they argue is seeking leniency from the government in exchange for his cooperation against Asaro. The trial will also include testimony about the alleged murder of Paul Katz, a Mafia associate who disappeared in 1969. Prosecutors allege that Asaro and Burke strangled Katz with a dog chain because they feared he was cooperating with law enforcement."

And he didn’t seem to be quite yet ready to let the Jeb ribbing go.“It’s not for him,” he said on ABC’s ""This Week,"" in discussing the difficulties of the presidential campaign. “And, you know, I hate to see what’s happening with him, but his campaign is a disaster; he’s paid one person $1.3 million, some finance director. Paid him $1.3 million -- that’s almost more than I pay for my whole deal! His -- you know, when I look at what I’ve done, I’m No. 1 in virtually every poll and I spent less money than any other candidate that’s running.”"

USA!"" At least three separate protest groups showed up to the Republican presidential candidate's rally at his Trump National Doral Miami resort, with some bearing signs reading ""Dignity"" and ""Equality."" Ariel Rojas, one of eight student protesters from Florida International University, was seen on video being forcefully dragged to the ground by his collar and then kicked as rally-goers cheered.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to calls or emails about the scene, but NBC Miami reported that the campaign said the man who dragged the protester was neither a Trump campaign staffer nor an employee of the resort, but ""merely an attendee"" at the rally. Trump acknowledged the protesters several times during his hour-long speech. At one point, he encouraged people to remove the protesters and noted, ""You can get 'em out, but don't hurt 'em."" ""See the first group, I was nice: 'Oh, take your time,'"" Trump said from the lectern. ""The second group, I was pretty nice. The third group, I'll be pretty more violent. And the fourth group, I'll say, 'Get the hell out of here!'"" At least six other protesters were removed, including Maria Rodriguez, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, reported Spanish-language news channel AmèricaTèVe. Trump's Friday appearance marked his first official campaign rally in Florida. Trump was warmly greeted by supporters and delivered a familiar speech that included shots at his party rivals, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson, and promises to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. A litany of extreme statements about immigration -- which particularly target Latino immigrants -- have drawn the ire of several social justice groups like those that demonstrated at Friday's rally. Now that protesters are as expected as Trump's anti-immigration remarks, the candidate predicted how the event would be reported in the coming days.'There's a total of maybe three over there and five over there and they'll be the story tomorrow, not the thousands of people that love our country,"" Trump said. ""It's a shame.""Also on HuffPost:"

He is just behind Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican 2016 presidential nomination.Helping Carson position himself as the answer to Americans' frustration with Washington gridlock is Barry Bennett, 52, a Washington insider, who is running a decidedly non-traditional campaign to build his client's brand.Under Bennett's guidance, the campaign enables supporters to connect with Carson with unusual intimacy: they can get emailed or texted questions personally answered; or huddle on his Facebook page every day; and donors can even have their children's names posted on the campaign's bus.Carson's campaign relies heavily on the Internet to get his message across, more so than the campaigns of his 13 rivals. The campaign's Facebook page has more than 4 million followers, while Carson's Instagram account has 127,000.One popular Facebook feature shows fans holding handwritten explanations of their support for Carson. Bennett says urging supporters to take more of those photos was his idea to drive voter engagement.Starting this month, the campaign began using a computer program that lets one staffer answer up to 9,000 questions per day. Supporters will be able to text or email Carson a question and get an individual response. The program uses an algorithm that groups together questions that may look unique but are actually similar enough to elicit a single answer. Bennett says using the program was also his idea.In an interview at Carson's campaign headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, Bennett saw no contradiction in a long-time Washington political operative helping a candidate whose main selling point is that he has never worked in Washington.""We both believe Washington needs to be turned upside down,"" he said.He also said he has no problems with some of Carson's more controversial statements. Carson has faced sharp criticism for comments suggesting the Holocaust could have been diminished if Jews had been armed, and that victims of a recent mass shooting in Oregon should have fought harder against the gunman.""He doesn't speak in a way that Washington politicians are trained to speak, so to some people that sounds crazy but to me and most of America that sounds refreshing,"" Bennett said.Indeed polls show that Carson has not been hurt at all by the comments. In fact, he may even have grown stronger.AN INSIDER'S STORYBennett, who has worked for 30 years as a political operative for hire, has also helped to mastermind a data-collection operation that has enabled Carson to tap into an army of small donors and out-raise his rivals.As of Friday, Carson had raised more than $37 million, from 725,000 donors, with the average donation size at $51, according to a tally provided by Bennett. His nearest Republican fund-raising rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, had each raised about $25 million by the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission filings.Bennett's career began when, as a student, he started doing data entry for President Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign. After working in the Ohio state legislature, Bennett moved to Washington, where he worked for the Republican National Committee and Ohio Senator Rob Portman and founded a media analysis firm. In short, he became a Washington insider.""Who with a 202 (Washington) area code on their cell phone would even think of working for Carson?"" said New Hampshire Republican strategist Dave Carney.Carney said most veteran operatives would have balked at what many see as Carson's moonshot bid for the presidency. He gave Bennett credit for seeing something in Carson when others didn't.""He saw an opportunity where most folks would turn their nose up at it.""Carson has used the opportunity to play with some out-of-the box ideas, like appealing to supporters for donations in exchange for having their children's names displayed on a campaign bus. The bus is now covered with hundreds of little stick figures whose shapes are filled in with names written in tiny script.""He's got outsized talents with a moderate-sized ego,"" said Republican strategist Matt Schlapp, who knows Bennett. ""Usually it's the other way around.""ROMNEY FILMUntil now, Bennett was probably best known for having produced ""When Mitt Romney Came to Town"" during the 2012 Republican primaries, when he was working as an independent consultant. It was a 28-minute collection of interviews with people who lost their jobs after Romney's private equity firm Bain Capital took over their companies.The film dampened voters' enthusiasm for Romney and forced his campaign to go into damage control mode, said a former Romney staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.""I wished he was on our side,"" he said of Bennett.In 2016, Bennett has been on the other side of political attacks, defending Carson's controversial statements.On Carson's comments encouraging people to fight back against gunmen, Bennett invoked the victims of the al Qaeda-hijacked airplane Flight 93, which crashed into a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001. Investigators believe the passengers thwarted a planned attack when they stormed the cockpit and attempted, unsuccessfully, to regain control of the aircraft.""That's what you hope you'd do in that situation,"" Bennett said.(Reporting By Emily Flitter; Additional reporting by Grant Smith, editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin)Also on HuffPost:"

The hot seller is a compromise: half blue and black, half white and gold, said CEO Chad Horstman.Also in high demand is Pizza Rat - a gray mini dress with a tail, hood, ears and two pepperoni pizza slice pockets - that is arguably sexier than the video of a New York City rat dragging a pizza slice down subway steps, shared more than 100,000 times on Twitter in the last month, according to Topsy.com.The lion-slaying dentist Walter Palmer of Minnesota who gained notoriety for his trophy kill of Cecil the Lion, considered a national treasure in Zimbabwe, inspired a $139.99 getup from Costumeish.com, complete with a blood spattered dental smock and mock lion head.""It used to be we all watched the same TV shows, we all knew the same cultural references. Now the culture is really fragmented,"" said Robert Thompson, who teaches pop culture at Syracuse University in upstate New York. ""These news stories, the ones that hit the big time, that cross that point of penetration, those are the things that everybody shares.""Jim Von Schilling, the Pennsylvania-based area chairman of the Popular Culture Association, said when it comes to envisioning a Halloween costume, imaginations are sparked by current events.""The world around us is our pop culture,"" said Von Schilling. LIMITS TO POKING FUNThe costumes are meant to touch a nerve, but some vendors say there are lines they will not cross.Ricky's NYC, a beauty supply store that features Halloween costumes, and Yandy.com both decided against carrying a Caitlyn Jenner costume featuring a shiny white padded bustier resembling the outfit the Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star formerly known as Bruce wore to come out as transgender in a Vanity Fair cover story.""The transgender community is a huge portion of my customer base and is incredibly offended by this,"" said Richard Parrott, president of Ricky's. ""I don't really see anything funny about somebody wanting to change their gender. There is no place to really poke fun.""Jenner told NBC News last month that she did not find the costume offensive: ""I'm in on the joke... I think it's great.""Politicians are typically fair game and Ricky's carries a Hillary Clinton mask and Yandy a Donald Trump costume consisting of a white collared shirt, red tie, royal blue blazer and ""booty shorts"" with extra accessories including a ""Making America Great"" hat and a straw colored ""comb over politician wig.""Halloween costumes that snark rather than spook tend to focus on figures who have fallen from grace, said Jack Santino, who teaches popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.""They are people who were kind of ridiculous and there is a kind of 'Emperor Has No Clothes' element,"" Santino said. ""At Halloween, people just mock them to say, 'We all know you're ridiculous. You're not fooling anyone.'""Irreverent Halloween costumes tend to be worn by adults but some parents, seizing on the natural tendency of babies to look like old men, have been dressing their infants as Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with eyeglasses and unruly white wigs, posting their pictures to Twitter as #BabiesForBernie.Ready-made costumes can be expensive but for frugal Trick or Treaters there is a free online makeup tutorial that a cosmetologist posted on Instagram with tips for looking like Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue same-same marriage licenses.

Portugal’s president, Anibal Cavaco Silva, fueled an ongoing debate about the future of European democracy on Thursday when he reappointed an outgoing center-right prime minister despite election results that gave three left-leaning political parties the majority of seats in parliament. Cavaco Silva named center-right leader Pedro Passos Coelho prime minister over the objections of Socialist leader Antonio Costa. Passos Coelho’s Forward Portugal Alliance (PAF) received the largest share of the vote of any single party in the Oct. 4 elections, the president said in a televised speech Thursday, and the party with the best showing has always formed the government since Portugal returned to democracy 40 years ago.Cavaco Silva made clear, however, that his decision was influenced more by the desire to avoid challenging eurozone fiscal policy than by mere consideration for the country’s political traditions. ""In 40 years of democracy, the Portuguese governments never depended on anti-European political factions,"" he said.Costa, the Socialist leader, has asked to form a cabinet with the support of a parliamentary majority that includes the radical Left Bloc and Communist Party, since together, the three parties received over 50 percent of the country’s votes and have the power to control Portugal’s parliament. The Left Bloc and Communist Party are considered “euro-skeptics,” but the Socialist party, which would control the cabinet, is decidedly committed to remaining in the eurozone.To be sure, as the president noted, Passos Coelho’s PAF won 38.6 percent of the vote in the country’s Oct. 4 elections -- the largest share of any single political faction. In Portugal’s political system, however, a minority cabinet is virtually guaranteed to fail without the support of a parliamentary majority.""It is incomprehensible to name a prime minister who the president knows in advance will not be able to hold majority support in parliament,"" Costa told Agence France-Presse Friday.Cavaco Silva said he fears that Costa’s premiership would put Portugal on a path to confrontation with eurozone leaders and international creditors. Costa has proposed to end the country’s ""obsession with austerity"" by, among other things, restoring spending on education and health care.Observing Portugal's commitments to the eurozone ""is decisive, is totally crucial for the financing of our economy and, consequently, for economic growth and job creation,” Cavaco Silva said. He fretted that a left-leaning ruling government would jeopardize Portugal’s standing with its international creditors.“After having completed a demanding program of financial aid, which implied heavy sacrifices for the Portuguese, it is my duty, within the scope of my constitutional remit, to do everything possible to avoid that wrong signals are transmitted to the financial institutions, investors and markets, placing in question the country’s external trust and credibility,” he said.Portugal exited a 78 billion euro ($116 billion) international bailout program in May 2014, which required unpopular wage and pension cuts. But the country must continue to reduce spending and increase taxes if it is to meet the eurozone's requirement that it reduce its debt to 60 percent of GDP within the next 20 years.German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has led the continent’s push for austerity in response to the Great Recession and subsequent eurozone debt crisis, expressed her support for a center-right government. “Given the election results in Portugal, we hope Pedro [Passos Coelho] will be successful in forming a government,” she said on Thursday, in a speech to the center-right European People’s Party in Madrid.But Passos Coelho’s government may not last long. Costa has said he would back an effort to oust the PAF from power if he can secure support from the other left-leaning parties. Passos Coelho must submit a four-year program within 10 days of taking office, and the Left Bloc and Communist Party have announced plans to reject any program that does not significantly undo austerity policies. If a majority of parliament rejects a prime minister’s four-year program, the ruling government collapses.In that scenario, it would be up to President Cavaco Silva to tap another leader to form a ruling government. Given his harsh rhetoric, he might still deny Costa the opportunity do so, prompting a political crisis.Portugal’s political system effectively precludes new elections from taking place until June at the earliest, raising the prospect that the president could be forced to appoint an unelected caretaker cabinet in the interim.Critics say the dilemma facing Portugal shows how the eurozone’s economic mandates undermine its commitment to democracy.Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, a columnist for The Telegraph, compared the situation in Portugal to the one in Greece, where the radical left Syriza party was elected in January to undo austerity policies, but ultimately was forced to agree to even harsher spending cuts and tax increases than were in place before.“Greece’s Syriza movement, Europe’s first radical-Left government in Europe since the Second World War, was crushed into submission for daring to confront eurozone ideology,” Evans-Pritchard wrote Friday. “Now the Portuguese Left is running into a variant of the same meat-grinder.”Antonio Costa Pinto, a political science professor at the University of Lisbon, voted for Passos Coelho’s center-right coalition earlier this month, but told The Huffington Post on Saturday that he opposes President Cavaco Silva’s attempt to exclude the radical left political parties.“The president cannot exclude from Portuguese democracy two parties -- the Left Bloc and the Communists -- that represent 1 million voters and 20 percent of the Portuguese electorate,” Pinto said.To do so, he added, would mean that “nowadays, especially in the periphery of Europe, parties that do not support the strict policy orientations within the eurozone do not count.”Related on HuffPost:"

""Think about this,"" he told ""Meet the Press."" ""During slavery -- and I know that's one of those words you're not supposed to say, but I'm saying it -- during slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave. Anything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionist had said, you know, 'I don't believe in slavery. I think it's wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do'? Where would we be?""Rising in the polls in Iowa -- with its deeply evangelical Republican caucusgoers -- Carson called for overturning the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision and only conceded that ""there's room to discuss"" an exception if the health of the mother was at stake. Below is the relevant transcript, pasted in full because his answers were often hard to tease out.CHUCK TODD: Okay. Do you want to see Roe v. Wade overturned?Carson's comments to ""Meet The Press"" are the latest in a fairly scattered history when it comes to abortion policy. Carson has stated his support for a bill that would ban abortions at 20 weeks. And as a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins he was personally opposed to abortion. But as POLITICO reported, he also “has referred women to doctors who perform abortions [and] was a trustee of a foundation that gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Planned Parenthood.” As for the slavery analogy, this seems to be a favorite of the presidential candidate's. He's compared Obamacare to slavery as well. "
