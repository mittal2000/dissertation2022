So it wasn't any surprise that I, along with millions of other sushi lovers around the world, gobbled up the film Jiro Dreams of Sushi when it was released in 2011. The film tells the story of Jiro Ono, an 88-year-old sushi master who is considered by many to be the best sushi chef in the world. He runs a small sushi restaurant inside Tokyo's Ginza Subway Station called Sukiyabashi Jiro, the only sushi restaurant in the world to receive three Michelin Stars. In addition to telling Jiro's story, the film arguably features some of the most beautiful and mouth-watering depictions of sushi ever seen on film. (If you watch the film, I recommend having sushi nearby.) So when I was invited to go Japan recently on a speaking tour, I eagerly called up my hotel and asked if they could make a reservation. After many attempts -- the restaurant's phone line is only open a few hours a day, frequently it's busy or no one picks up -- they were finally able to get me a reservation for my first day in Tokyo. It took me a little while to find the restaurant inside the massive Ginza subway station, it has dozens of high-quality restaurants, boutiques, shops, and more. With one nondescript sign on the door, most people pass by without ever knowing what's inside. As soon as I walked in, a man ushered me to my seat, the menu was set and laid before me, with nineteen items on it. I was sitting with just four other people at the sushi bar, and I was very fortunate to be seated directly in front of Jiro. I could watch him work and prepare each piece. He has two other assistants, one of whom is his son, but Jiro is clearly in control of every aspect of the kitchen. Jiro laid my first piece of sushi down in front of me. It was squid, one of my favorites. Determined to savor every moment of this meal as much as possible, I bit into the squid, putting half back on my plate. The texture was smooth and soft with just the right amount of chewiness to it. I instantly concluded this was the best squid I'd ever eaten. Just as I proceeded to the second bite, Jiro said to me in Japanese, ""One bite please!"" In most restaurants I probably would have snapped back at anyone who told me I was eating a piece of food the wrong way. But when Jiro gave me this instruction I instantly recoiled, as if I had broken a sacred covenant, apologized and took pains to avoid repeating this unforgivable mistake throughout the rest of the meal.Next up was an absolutely delicious piece of yellow tail. Following that was the smelt roe, which I normally avoid at all costs when at an ordinary sushi restaurant but here it was heavenly. The abalone literally melted like butter in my mouth. I kept looking at my menu anxiously assuring myself that there still much more to come. In between courses, I watched Jiro intently, as he crafted each piece of sushi with precision and technique of a sculptor. He molded the rice with his bare hands into a tightly condensed and perfectly shaped rectangle. Like a painter, he would take a brush and paint the fish with one incredibly light coat of sauce. He was a culinary artist and each piece of sushi was a masterpiece.  Jiro lays down a piece of sushi on the author's plateThe eel which came second to last, had the lightest touch of wasabi between the fish and the rice. In one fluid motion, Jiro painted it with the sauce and put the sushi down in front of me. Eel is one of my favorite sushi dishes and I had never tasted anything like this eel before. During that course, I realized why Jiro's sushi is so good. Everything Jiro does to each dish is dynamically designed to highlight and bring out the flavor of the fish. Jiro has an excellent ability to select the finest quality fish from Tokyo's legendary Tsukiji fish market, and the fish are the secret ingredients in each dish, hidden in plain sight. The wasabi, sauce, and rice, all function as arrows pointing towards the fish, making it the center of attention, everything is designed to allow the diners to taste the flavor of the fish. Given that the fish is the one ingredient least in the chef's control, such an approach takes true humility and grace. And you would be hard-pressed to meet a chef as humble or as graceful as Jiro. The final course was egg, which was so perfectly done that it ranked among the best bread puddings I've ever had, the combination of sweet and savory. For dessert, there was crescent slice Japanese winter melon, which is essentially a very high-end cantaloupe. Like the rest of the meal, it was elegant in its simplicity. With the attention Jiro Dreams of Sushi received, it would be easy for Jiro to fly around the world hawking products, opening restaurants, and film a show for The Food Network. But clearly he's not interested in becoming a personality. He is a chef, and while he is in some senses a ""celebrity chef,"" he has almost never missed a day of work. However, he has begrudgingly accepted his fame, at the conclusion of the meal he offered to sign our menus and take pictures with each diner. Usually when I eat a great meal, I come away thinking about how great the meal was, talking about it with my friends, and looking at pictures I took during the meal. But the reflection period typically ends there. My meal at Jiro's was different. I actually came away with a true appreciation of sushi-making as an art form in part because I could watch the process right in front of me and understand how much artistry was involved. Some reports of meals at Jiro's have suggested that the experience is impersonal and that there is not the kind of service that usually accompanies such an expensive meal. What I think that is mistaken for is the fact that Jiro does not care deeply about how full the restaurant is, or if diners are entertained. He cares that the food is good, something that he happily leaves up to the diners, much in the same way that a great painter doesn't paint to make money, achieve fame, or to please the public. And like most people with so much passion and supreme talent for what they do, Jiro has achieved all those things anyway.  The author with Jiro Ono in September 2013 Salmon Roe Eel"

3,WELLNESS,Lady Gaga Says She's Addicted To Marijuana: Is It Possible?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-addiction-lady-gaga_us_5b9da79de4b03a1dcc8ae55d,"Comparatively, Scientific American pointed out that in a 1994 study showing that 9 percent of people who've tried marijuana",2013-11-11,"NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 10: Lady Gaga attends artRAVE: Lady Gaga's 'Artpop' Official Album Release Party on November 10, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Gary Gershoff/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da79d2000002d00fe0c2e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lady Gaga has revealed details of her marijuana addiction, explaining that at one point, she was smoking 15 to 20 marijuana cigarettes a day, according to news reports.""I have been addicted to it and it's ultimately related to anxiety coping and it's a form of self-medication,"" Gaga said on the Z100 Morning Show, as reported by People magazine. Gaga broke her hip earlier this year, causing her to cancel part of her Born This Way tour. ""I was living on a totally other psychedelic plane, numbing myself completely, and looking back I do see now that some of it had to do with my hip pain,"" she told Z100, as reported by People. ""I didn't know where the pain was coming from so I was just in a lot of pain and very depressed all the time and not really sure why."" While research has shown that the percentage of people who try marijuana and become addicted to it is small, it is possible to get hooked on the drug. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 9 percent of marijuana users become dependent on the drug, with that percentage going up for people who begin using the drug in adolescence. Comparatively, Scientific American pointed out that in a 1994 study showing that 9 percent of people who've tried marijuana become dependent on it, the numbers are higher for other substances: alcohol is 15 percent, heroin is 23 percent and nicotine is 32 percent. Marijuana withdrawal (officially called cannabis withdrawal in the recently released fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is also sometimes seen in people who stop using marijuana, and is characterized by anxiety, problems sleeping, irritability and aggression, the NIDA reported. And while it's impossible to die from a marijuana overdose like you would from other illicit, dangerous drugs, dependence on marijuana can cause disruptions to people's lives, TIME reported. However, TIME pointed out that addiction to marijuana does not look exactly the same as addiction to other illicit drugs, such as heroin. TIME explains:In this view, the paradigm for addiction is heroin: the shaking, puking heroin junkie who can’t quit because the withdrawal sickness is impossible to bear. Because marijuana cessation is not linked with such severe symptoms, the drug isn’t seen as physically addictive. And considering that most people view physical addiction as uncontrollable, but psychological addiction as manageable with proper willpower, marijuana tends not to be regarded as addictive in general."
4,STYLE & BEAUTY,How to Pose for Pictures,"Kate 'Mr. Kate' Albrecht, Contributor
Author, YouTuber, DIY Expert, Interior and Jewelry Designer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-pose-for-pictures_us_5b9da68ae4b03a1dcc8acc7a,"Feeling like you look good in photos and finding your go-to ""pose,"" is mostly a personal thing. Some poses may work for some people and others, not so much.",2013-11-11,2013-11-08-textcollage_featured_fortext_poses_mrkate.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-08-textcollage_featured_fortext_poses_mrkate-thumb.jpg,"As a style blogger, I constantly post photos of myself. Some may call it ego-mania but I like to think of it as self love and yes, I'm currently in therapy. I often get questions from readers asking ""what are the best ways to pose for photos to look good, slim, taller, etc?"" Truth be told, I'm 5 foot 1, and a half, and yes, the half counts, but I have found the moves that make me feel good about most of the visual content that resides on digital platforms...most of the time I'm also in actual platforms (shoes). Feeling like you look good in photos and finding your go-to ""pose,"" is mostly a personal thing. Some poses may work for some people and others, not so much. The trick is to figure out your favorite moves that work for you! I used to be an actress and I learned the hard way that knowing your best angles and positions is essential because, ugh, there are some not-so-great photos out there of me posing on red carpets (please don't search engine me).So, to answer all those posers out there, here are some of my favorite poses that will hopefully help you find a new angle on life and feel great about yourself in all those tagged Facebook photos!Or we could also call this ""The armpit sniff"" - When posing solo, I often employ The Look Down pose which makes you seem effortless for a more candid result.I like The Arm Tuck pose when posing in the center of a group of people. If you tuck your elbows in at your sides and angle your palms forward or hold the person's back next to you, it is always slenderizing. I also always cock my head slightly to one side. I prefer the right side of my face, do you have a favorite side? I think a slight off angle gives you more dimension and personality rather than staring straight at the camera.The Pop Your Collar is a great pose to look candid. Give yourself some ""business"" to do in the photo like adjusting your collar or pushing back a lock of hair and you'll always look effortless. Also, notice my crossed legs in the above pic, I think it is a slimming pose if you can make it look natural.The Sideways Snuggle is a go-to pose for me when posing with a friend or my boyfriend. Angling your body completely towards the person you are standing next to will make you look slimmer, it also allows you that side-face angle that I mentioned in The Arm Tuck. Make contact with the person's face or chest and the resulting photo will be intimate and flattering. Ya know, The Jackie Chan leg kick or fighting pose when you want to look playful and silly and totally badass.  photos via stylebistro.comThese are some of the only photos I'm okay with from the red carpet. The Lolly-Pop Head is easy to achieve when you are a petite person because almost always, the person taking the photo is taller than you! Lolly-Pop Head basically means a slightly overhead angle that makes your head look big and thus, your body look smaller. I also employed The Hand On Hip (see below) in these photos. If someone is taking a photo of you, ask them to stand on a step or angle the camera down at you and see if you like the result!A super easy pose, the Thumb In Pocket, makes you look like you're chillin' like a villain. This is an easy pose to do solo or in a group photo. A classic group photo pose is The Hand on Hip. This is an essential pose if you are at the end of a group photo line-up. If you don't put your hand on your hip, you risk your arm looking wider than it actually is because of the angle of the lens. Putting your hand on your hip accentuates the nip of your waist and slims your arm. I also try to angle my chin down in group photos unless I'm being a ham. Bending one knee is also a good reflex so you don't look stiff.Okay, maybe not so practical but The Bunny pose is funny and gives you something to do with your hands if you're feeling awkward.If you have no make-up on or are just having a 'I don't want to show my face' kind of day, try The No-Makeup Kiss pose. In this picture above, I saw a photo was about to be snapped so I hid my face in a kiss! This pose will allow you to still participate in a photo-op enthusiastically but not have to feel self-concious.Kind of like The Look Down (above), this could also be called The Look Away. The Birdwatcher is a good way to look candid and also elongate your body by bringing your hands up to your face. I was acting like I was pushing my hair back (or watching birds), but bringing your arms up makes your torso stretch and if you pose to the side and cross your legs, it is instantly slimming!Pose at your own risk when using The Flasher. This is a silly pose that will give the photo action and humor... it's up to you if you want to be wearing a slip (or underwear) when you do it!I hope these gave you some ideas for your own picture poses. Let me know what are your favorite poses or if I missed any good ones! Comment below and remember to always feel good about yourself, even if you encounter a bad photo... #untag!"
