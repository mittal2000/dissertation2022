2,POLITICS,Kansas Bans Poor People From Spending Welfare On Cruise Ships,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-welfare_n_7001116.html,,2015-04-04,"Kansas state Sen. Michael O'Donnell, a Wichita Republican, speaks to a colleague during the Senate's session, Tuesday, March 24, 2015, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan. O'Donnell was among senators opposed to a proposal to block state agencies and school districts from deducting charitable contributions for workers directly from their paychecks. (AP Photo/Nicholas Clayton)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f12a2200004301dd83b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kansas welfare recipients will be unable to get more than $25 per day in ATM cash withdrawals under a new law sent this week to Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's desk by the state legislature. The bill also prohibits welfare recipients from spending their benefits at certain types of businesses, including liquor stores, fortune tellers, swimming pools and cruise ships. ""We're trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended,"" state Rep. Michael O'Donnell (R) said, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. ""This is about prosperity. This is about having a great life.""Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, often known as ""welfare,"" is one of several federal programs administered by states at the ground level. The Kansas TANF program, known locally as the Successful Families Program, offers a family of three as much as $429 per month in cash benefits. Kansas is one of at least 37 states that distributes benefits on government-issued debit cards, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Under the new rule, a three-person family receiving the maximum benefit would have to go to the ATM more than a dozen times to get the full benefit in cash, which would be whittled away by a $1 fee for each withdrawal. And the local cruise liner ATM will no longer be an option. The federal welfare reform law of 1996 gave states significant leeway to design their own programs, and for the past five years, state Republicans have been busy pursuing changes to TANF, food stamps and unemployment insurance, with varying degrees of success. Missouri Republicans, for instance, are considering a bill to forbid food stamps from being spent on steak or seafood. But national welfare advocates were taken aback by the $25 daily limit in Kansas, something that has not been implemented in any other state. ""This provision makes it nearly impossible for a recipient who does not have a checking account to pay rent,"" Liz Schott of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in an email. ""Moreover, it actually takes money from the pockets of poor families [in fees].""The provision originally would have limited daily benefits to $60, but state Sen. Caryn Tyson (R) reduced the amount through an amendment. Neither Tyson nor O'Donnell responded to interview requests from HuffPost. Shannon Cotsoradis, director of Kansas Action for Children, said changes by the Brownback administration, such as shorter time limits, have already reduced TANF enrollment significantly. The number of Kansans receiving benefits has declined from 38,000 in 2011 to 15,000 last year, state data show.Cotsoradis said she didn't know whether the dollar limit would further reduce enrollment, but suggested it probably wouldn't help families escape poverty. ""It adds stress to families already experiencing toxic levels of stress,"" Cotsoradis said an interview. HuffPost readers: Do you get Successful Families Program benefits? Tell us about it -- email arthur@huffingtonpost.com. Please include your phone number if you're willing to be interviewed.CORRECTIONS: A previous version of this article stated that the transaction fee per withdrawal was 85 cents for each transaction after the first. It is $1 per transaction, plus any additional ATM fees. Schott's quote citing the erroneous figure has also been corrected. The article also previously suggested the law limits TANF beneficiaries to $25 in benefits per day. The limitation applies specifically to ATM cash withdrawals."

I was leaving for Ireland on December 29th, and, other than a rental car and a plane ticket, I had nothing booked. My brother and I had a vague idea that we wanted to drive from Dublin across the West Coast, via the Wild Atlantic Way. Beyond that, we knew nothing.It's easy for a lack of planning to result in stress. However, for us, the opposite happened. We had the advantage of traveling during low season; while some sites were closed, most lodging options, and even the roads, were empty. This gave us the dual advantage of having hostel dorm rooms all to ourselves, as well as the option to book at (literally) the last minute and still have plenty of diversity in our choices.But there was another advantage of planning less. When we were invited to Donegal with locals, we were able to go without a hitch. When we stayed with family friends, we spent more time with them than we'd anticipated because there was no need to get on the road. Casually, we drank beer, ate steaks, saw Enya's home pub, and visited one of the most beautiful coasts I've ever seen. It felt like a vacation and an adventure at the same time. The flexibility ended up being a gift in itself.It's common knowledge that traveling to most parts of the world during the winter isn't ideal. Truly, there aren't that many places that enjoy great weather during the winter months: chances are, if it isn't snowing and bitter cold, it's rainy. But, as I was reminded soon after my winter departure, traveling while the rest of the world hibernates or migrates to the beach can leave more room for spontaneity and adventure than there would be at other times of the year. There's a distinct pleasure that comes with vacant tourist sites. But there's also wild excitement to be had in leaving the plans at home and seeing where life takes you."
5,STYLE,Beginner's Guide to Looking More Date-Worthy,"Charles A. Johnson, ContributorCreator of AskDearLove.com, Relationship Expert, Certified Lif...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beginners-guide-to-looking-more-date-worthy_b_7002320.html,"Looking date-worthy is the biggest, yet easiest problem to solve.

In a perfect world, our soulmates would have laser vision into our souls, but this isn't quite the case. Looking date-worthy is the biggest, yet easiest problem to solve. That's why I wanted to share this quick guide to looking more datable, and using non-verbal communication to attract more dates:  Stay True to Size  I put this first because it's the number one problem I see amongst my clients. Either their clothes are too big or too small. The latter is worse, but the solution to this problem is a piece of cake. Get measured. Go to a local tailor and have them size you. Ditch the baggy, saggy attire and leave your two sizes too small wardrobe behind, because your buttons popping off on a date just isn't attractive.Come Alive with Colors Your favorite colors aren't always the ones you should be wearing because they might be accentuating your flaws or hiding your most attractive features. Just like peanut butter goes with jelly, there's a similar science to skin tones and colors- some just work better in tandem. Consult a color style guide to choose your clothing according to your skin tone. Wearing the colors that complement your skin will help you come alive and become more noticeable to potential dates.Keep a Fresh Face Your face is the first thing people notice, so take GOOD care of it. Whether you're a man or a woman, maintain a proper skin care routine using daily cleansers and moisturizers to keep your skin looking youthful and fresh. And fellas, take care of that scruff- a little bit may give you the Hugo Boss appeal but too much will make you look like you gave up on life. Ladies, before you cake on the makeup, consult a professional or get free advice by visiting the cosmetics department at most major retail stores. I can't tell you how important this is. Wearing too much makeup will communicate that you are insecure about your natural self, and men will run off if they feel you are too insecure. Get the Right Do You may be hiding your most alluring features like your eyes or cheekbones with the wrong hair-do. See a stylist or use a guide to find the right haircut that will flatter your face shape. If you're nervous about making a drastic change, try on a wig before making the cut. Dress Well Dressing well has more to do with knowing what your potential date wants to see and less to do with your size, shape, and weight. Most men like to see women in a nice dress and heels, and most women would agree that they like to see men in a well-fitted suit or dress pants with a button up, and dress shoes. Invest in these basics and make sure to get pieces that accentuate your best features. For my clients that are on a budget, you can still find good quality formal wear for discounted prices. I often recommend that my clients shop the sale sections at major department stores or use Express Coupons online to find reasonably-priced suits, ties, dresses, shoes, and accessories. Walk the Talk Your shoes communicate more than just good style. They are the icing on the cake; the cake being your outfit. If your shoes are on point and in good repair, it will show your potential date that you care about the little things too. Get a good pair of comfortable classics: for men I recommend a classic pair of black loafers and for women, either nude pumps or comfortable black slingbacks.Accessorize to Personalize If you've read my book, How to Find the Right One and Make it Last!, you'll recognize this quote ""I believe accessories complement a nice outfit like a beautiful frame compliments a great painting."" When you want to stand out in a crowd full of people, wearing a nice scarf, hat, watch or statement jewelry will get you noticed, even if you are pairing it with casual attire. Remember that accessorizing your outfit says a lot about your personality too; it shows that you've taken an extra step to perfect your look. This will show your date that you are capable of going the extra mile in a relationship too."
6,BUSINESS,15 Highest-Paying Companies In America,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/highest-paying-companies_n_7004460.html,Netflix sounds like a great place to work.,2015-04-04,"The Netflix Inc. logo is displayed at the entrance to the company's headquarters in Los Gatos, California, U.S., on Thursday, July 21, 2011. Neflix Inc. will be reporting their second quarter results on July 25 2011. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31ec22600003600820908.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story was originally published by 24/7 Wall St.The median income for all Americans was $35,540 in 2013, up slightly from the year before. At a number of U.S. companies, salaries are considerably higher. Based on figures provided by Glassdoor, 24/7 Wall St. examined the 15 highest paying companies in America. At these companies, the median annual compensation is at least four times the nationwide median income.The companies that pay their employees the most fall primarily into two industries: consulting firms and tech companies. These companies attract some of the nation’s most highly-skilled workers, who demand high salaries to match their expected performance.According to Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, both types of high-paying companies require very high-skilled workers. However, these workers are highly paid for very different reasons.Six of the highest paying companies are consulting firms, law firms, accounting firms, or some combination of the three. Chamberlain explained there are barriers to competition in these kinds of companies. It is very difficult to uproot very old firms with relationships cultivated over long periods of time by very experienced employees.“When you are a consulting firm you don’t have much in the way of machines and other capital,” Chamberlain said. Instead, “you have a little bit of software, you have an office space, but your main asset is the human capital in the heads of your partners.” The value of these types of companies is disproportionately in their employees, and they are highly paid as a result.Click here to see the highest paying companies in America.The other nine companies are in the information technology sector, particularly semiconductor manufacturing and its related services. These companies also require very high-skilled workers. However, the shortage of labor in these sectors is the primary reason these companies pay so well. “There is definitely a bidding war in the Bay Area for certain types of positions,” Chamberlain said. While this trend is industry-wide, all of the nine highest paying tech sector companies were located in California.For instance, the growth in new technologies such as mobile devices has been so rapid it has been impossible for the labor market to keep up. Chamberlain suggested the shortage has been further compounded by restrictive immigration policies like the hard cap on H1B visas, which allow U.S. companies to bring specialty workers from overseas. These polices have put constraints on the supply of workers, further driving up competition.None of the highest paying companies are in the manufacturing or goods producing industries that would have characterized a similar list several decades ago. The difference, according to Chamberlain, is that many of the jobs provided by the companies currently on this list are very difficult to outsource because they require relatively advanced judgements and non-routine tasks.While paying high salaries perhaps makes a poor work environment more tolerable, it does not guarantee workplace satisfaction. All but one highest paying company received an overall employee rating greater than 3.2 out of 5, the average company rating from Glassdoor reviewers. CEO approval ratings were also strong in many of these companies, but not universally. More than 80% of reviewers in just six of the highest paying companies approved of their CEO.To identify the highest paying companies in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the median annual salaries in companies provided by Glassdoor. Employee ratings, CEO approval ratings, and the percentage of employees who would recommend the company to a friend also came from Glassdoor. Revenue figures and total headcounts for public companies came from financial filings. When available, company information for private companies was provided by the companies themselves.These are America’s highest paying companies."

IS had held Tikrit since last June.Local officials said the mayhem left hundreds of homes and shops looted or torched.

That it would come from a protégé of Dick Cheney is neither surprising nor excusable. On Hardball with Chris Matthews Ron Christie uttered some of the most nonsensical, insensitive, and factually dubious comments I have heard in a while. Mounting an attack against the recently completed framework for Iranian nuclear containment he likened President Obama's efforts to those of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Aside from the cheap and tawdry nature of the accusation, it is intellectually bankrupt and petty. In the eyes of the lunatic fringe evidently Obama is not only a Muslim, Kenyan, and Socialist but also a Nazi sympathizer. The childishness of the accusations is only eclipsed by the vapidity with which they are dispensed. Dick Cheney should be in Guantanamo serving a life sentence for the damage he has wrought on the battlefield and in the arena of American national security interest. He is a lunatic, a dangerous one at that and he continues to this day to spread his hate-mongering to any audience that is desperate enough to have him. Ron Christie was an advisor to Cheney and his baseless political hucksterism does not qualify him for prison but certainly does bring into question his value as a commentator. Reading from a prepared script does not qualify anyone to be taken seriously, particularly when it is devoid of substantive considerations. He is purely and simply a political hack.The conservative Republican talking points memo on Iran was drafted long before even the faintest outlines of a framework were discussed. It is extremely hard to take seriously the opposition position that renders the mere act of negotiating an agreement a non-starter. The position that negotiation has no place in disposition of the serious issues involved when it comes to nuclear capacity in Iran is as deceitful as it is dangerous. Have these neoconservative nincompoops not done enough damage already? To be clear their opposition is not to the construct of an agreement as much as it is a statement that anything short of war should be on the table. The same neocon thinking that led us to the most strategically disastrous blunder in American history, namely the invasion of Iraq and subsequent execution of a governmental purge known as deBathification is very much alive in the comments of noted failures such as Cheney, Bolton, and now this mouthpiece Ron Christie. An outraged Matthews did everything he could to ridicule Christie short of cutting off his microphone. I would offer that Christie's performance should foreclose the option of him ever being invited to appear on any program designed to discuss serious issues involving international affairs. He obviously takes his cue from the attack first and ask questions later crowd and if there is need for discussion of whether war or peace is an appropriate response to issues in tinderbox areas of the world such as the Middle East then maybe there is consideration of his opinion. However, on issues of substance he is ill equipped to participate in the discussion. The Republicans have got this one wrong and will not be supported by the American public at large. They have overplayed their hand by plunging blindly into reckless politicization of the issues of war and peace and if they succeed in derailing an attempt to peacefully settle the issue at hand will drive a wedge into the heart of American public opinion unlike any seen since the dark days surrounding our involvement in Vietnam."

But discrepancies in the story soon surfaced, and the magazine was forced to retract it.The story's autopsy could lead to a shakeup at Rolling Stone, founded in 1967 by editor Jann Wenner. The magazine, best known for its pop music coverage, was a pioneer in the ""New Journalism"" of the 1960s and '70s, an approach characterized by a reporter's immersion in the subject matter.If the report is highly critical, it ""will have an enormous impact on Rolling Stone. It's going to affect the credibility of Rolling Stone going forward, period,"" said Stuart Benjamin, a Duke University Law School professor.Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism will release its report at 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) on Sunday, with a news conference at 12 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Monday. Dean Steve Coll, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, headed the review.The findings will appear on Rolling Stone's website, RollingStone.com, and the website of the Columbia Journalism Review, cjr.org. JACKIE'S STORYThe 9,000-word article described a Sept. 28, 2012, gang rape of a University of Virginia first-year student, identified by her real first name, Jackie, allegedly during a pledge party at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.The article written by Sabrina Rubin Erdely accused the Charlottesville school, the 21,000-student flagship of the Virginia state university system, of tolerating a culture that ignored sexual violence against women. It raised deep concern and national soul-searching about sexual assault at U.S. campuses in general.After its publication, the school suspended fraternity and sorority activities and enacted more safety measures, and Governor Terry McAuliffe urged a review of policies at the school.But Phi Kappa Psi rebutted key parts of the article, and the Washington Post reported that Rolling Stone had not checked out the rape claim with any of the accused. In December, Rolling Stone apologized, citing ""discrepancies"" in Jackie's account.Charlottesville police said last month they had found no evidence to back up the story, citing numerous inconsistencies. Jackie declined to give police a statement or answer their questions.Benjamin, the Duke law professor, said it was doubtful Rolling Stone would face any lawsuit for libel since no one had been identified by name as an attacker.Fraternities and sororities, social clubs at many U.S. colleges, often have their own housing and are known as the Greek system.As a public entity, the university is barred from suing. Both the campus chapter and national organization of Phi Kappa Psi also could be too large as groups to claim libel damages, he said.A suit by Phi Kappa Psi could lead to a potentially damaging ""fishing expedition"" by lawyers into the fraternity. Rolling Stone's reputation also is likely to be damaged anyway if the Columbia review is damning, he said.But Bruce Sanford, a Washington media lawyer with the firm of BakerHostetler, said hefty settlements arising from false accusations of rape against Duke lacrosse players in 2006 showed that the fraternity could potentially file a lawsuit.""The parallels are clear enough that they should worry Rolling Stone considerably, if they're not worried already,"" he said.

Residents in Aden say parts of the southern port city have been without water or electricity for two days.There was no sign of a halt in the fighting.Aden residents said ships from the Saudi-led coalition bombarded Houthi forces who have taken over districts close to the center of the city despite Riyadh's military campaign in support of their foe, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Hadi loyalists managed to push the Houthis and their allies from central Aden's Crater district on Friday, a rare victory after more than a week of gains by the Shi'ite Houthis, who are backed by soldiers loyal to ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh.Jets from the Saudi-led coalition parachuted weapons into Aden for a second day to bolster fighters loyal to Hadi, who fled Yemen 10 days ago and has watched from Saudi Arabia as the Houthis advanced on his supporters' last major foothold.A military spokesman for the Saudi coalition said it was providing substantial logistical support for Hadi's fighters. He declined to confirm or deny reports that Saudi special forces were operating in Aden.But a fighter in Aden, Khaled Ahmed Saif, appealed on local television for the coalition to send ground troops as soon as possible, saying the city was being subjected to a ""genocidal war"" by the Houthis.Late on Saturday, Houthi forces entered the central Aden district of Mualla, where the port is located, and witnesses reported heavy fighting.Residents said life was becoming unbearable. ""How long can people live without water or electricity?"" said Mohammad Fara'a. Another Crater resident, Hassan Abdallah, said people were using a long-disused well at one of the mosques to get water.Near the capital Sanaa, an air strike on the village of Okash killed a family of nine people on Friday night, residents said.Coalition spokesman Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri, asked about the calls for a humanitarian pause, said only that the military was ready for any instructions from its political leadership. He said aid agencies and governments should coordinate aid shipments with officials in Riyadh.TRIBES AGAINST AL QAEDAThe conflict in Yemen has turned the impoverished Arabian Peninsula state into the latest theater for Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia's proxy war with regional Shi'ite rival Iran, a struggle which is also playing out in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.Tehran denies Riyadh's charges that its arms the Houthis, who emerged as the country's most powerful faction when they took over the capital six months ago together with supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.Saudi Arabia, unnerved by the growing power of the Shi'ite Houthis on its southern flank, launched military attacks on March 26. Saudi jets have been backed by planes from its Gulf Arab neighbors.The United Arab Emirates state news agency said 100 Saudi aircraft were taking part along with 30 from the UAE, 15 each from Bahrain and Kuwait and 10 from Qatar.The latest fighting is one of many conflicts in Yemen, where mass demonstrations inspired by the wider Arab uprisings of 2011 led to Saleh's resignation after three decades in power plagued by southern separatism, tribal unrest and al Qaeda militancy.U.S. military officers conducting a covert drone war against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group's powerful regional wing, were withdrawn from Yemen last month, and the turmoil may provide the jihadi movement with the chance to entrench or expand in the country's remote east.Suspected al Qaeda fighters seized the port town of Mukalla on Thursday, freeing scores of prisoners including a local al Qaeda leader and ransacking banks, residents said.Military sources said they faced relatively little resistance from soldiers in a nearby military base. Soldiers also withdrew from two towns - Shihr and Riyan - further up the Arabian Sea coast, highlighting the further collapse of Yemen's fragile central authority.On Saturday, armed tribesmen in pickup trucks drove into central Mukalla, about 500 km (300 miles) east of Aden, to expel the al Qaeda militants. They pledged earlier to restore stability in town.

Window lit.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e9ca12600003500805945.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am an Indian-American mother, raising an Indian-American daughter, my beti. In many ways, I have the same fears, doubts and worries as any other mother. But as a first-generation immigrant, it is important to me to raise a daughter who is aware of her ethnic roots. I accept undeniably that my daughter is growing up in America, but I want her identity to include a conglomeration of western and Indian values and traditions, the best of both worlds. I want her to speak Hindi, to appreciate and enjoy Indian music and art, to understand Indian history, because I want her to feel a connection to her heritage and not think of it as alien. It is inevitable that my daughter will learn about the Indian culture not just from her parents, but also from our extended family and our friends who are Indians or Indian-Americans. She will learn by observing and absorbing what this community shows to her. But as with any community, there is a wide spectrum of ideologies and orthodoxy in the diaspora. And therein lies my dilemma. For every Indian cultural value I want to pass on to her, there are plenty that I do not want her to adopt, primarily those that have to do with the treatment of her sex. Old school culture has held back generations of women in India and exists like a sickly viral strain that still manages to thrive in the face of societal progression and education in India as well as the Indian diaspora in America. And I don't want my little girl getting sick.To be clear, and to state what should be obvious, neither India nor the Indian-American diaspora has a monopoly on perpetuating gender inequality. Even in the U.S., women are still fighting for fundamental fairness with wages and control over their reproductive systems. But my focus, selfishly, is on my daughter, and the countless girls like her who are being raised by or amidst a society that places upon them limitations or expectations, however high or low, simply because they are girls. All too often, Indian-American children raised in the U.S. are taught to conform to Indian cultural norms that stem from a painfully patriarchal system, not to mention that often the Indian immigrant parents are raising their children based on how Indian society was decades ago, when they first immigrated. With all the competing ideologies, it is imperative that I am loud and clear in the messages I want to pass on to my daughter. What I have on my side is that I am, right now, the biggest influence in my daughter's life. She's young and still wants to spend time with me and chat with me. But as the social influences in her life grow, my voice may fade into the background. So, while I still have her attention, I have to teach her, through example and through conversation, values that are important to me, starting with these: 1. Skin Deep:  I cannot be clearer: the color of your skin is irrelevant. You will hear often that a book is not to be judged by its cover. And yet, many in the Indian diaspora, much like Indian society itself, are preoccupied with the precise shade of brown each of us is. Even when a baby is born, skin color comes into play: ""he's got his dad's eyes and his light skin"" or, ""she's got dimples like her mother, and also her color,"" or ""he's darker than his sister."" And it's often meant innocently, just an observation that is being made, like identifying a car as being red or a mug as being blue. Except that this ""innocent"" identification of skin color is a perpetuation of our fascination with assigning value to the color of skin. If you're a girl, the spotlight is that much brighter. Find a family seeking a bride for their son and you'll often find them seeking a ""fair"" bahu (and a thin one too, of course), at least one who is lighter-skinned than their groom. Our distance from ""the motherland"" hasn't diluted our focus on skin color. When Nina Davuluri was crowned Miss America in 2013, many Indian-Americans congratulated her, while pointing out the irony that she was likely too dark to win a pageant in India, never mind that these commentators were themselves focusing on her skin color, albeit from a soap box. So, beti, be prepared to listen and ignore. There are people who will comment on the shade of your skin, who will judge you based on how ""tan"" you are, who may disregard you because you're not fair-skinned enough or may value you more because you're ""not that dark."" While your non-Indian friends will talk about lying out by the pool and working on their tan, your Indian elders will discourage you from spending time out in the sun. People may ply you with offers of home remedies and products to lighten your complexion. And some of these people, maybe most of them, will believe they mean well and are ""looking out for you."" Because in India, being fair may give you a step up; lighter skin is more likely to get you a better job, a seat on a bus and plenty of unwanted attention. But this isn't India. This is the United States; while I don't deny that racism exists in this country, you're up against a double whammy if the people of your own ethnicity also hold you up or push you down because of the color of your skin. So, forgive these ""well-intentioned"" people for their ignorance and pay no heed to them. They are perpetuating the very problem they are trying to protect you from. So go out and play heartily in the sun (but don't forget wear your sunscreen!).2. Girl Power: Many families are embarrassingly unabashed about their preference for boys over girls. In other families, the birth of a girl is viewed as good luck, with the baby said to embody the goddess of wealth and prosperity -- no pressure there, little one! In some parts of India, families host a celebration when the daughter gets her first period, because, honestly, what good is a girl who can't bear children? And yet, when that time of the month does come around, a girl is treated as unclean, an outcast who is shunned from temples, prayers or even the kitchen in some of the most orthodox of homes. The daughter is the izzat, the honor of the home; but don't mistake that position for a pedestal because if ever a man dishonors you, fingers will blame you, how you speak, how you dress, the company you keep, anything at all as long as you can be blamed. In the old country, while sons carry on the family name and are assumed to take care of the family, a daughter will simply leave her family to get married and take care of another: her husband and her in-laws. We may have Hindu goddesses of wealth, knowledge and empowerment, but those sculpted, decorated images are frozen in Indian temples. Indian girls are expected to be demure, obedient, and subservient.But not my daughter. Not you. You are not the izzat of our home. That is not your burden. What I want for you is to lead a life where you make decisions without worrying about what others may say about me or our family. You should have independent ambitions. I will do my best to give you the education and opportunities you deserve. With what you are given, I hope that you will contribute to society, work for humanity, be passionate, dream big and work hard. Make a mark, in whatever field you choose, but make the decision for you. Do not plan your future based on being someone's wife, daughter-in-law or mother. Whether in a classroom, a boardroom or just in the company of family, share your opinions and your ideas because they are valid and relevant. You do not have to ask permission to speak and you don't have to allow being interrupted. Be your own advocate, kind-hearted but strong in conviction, polite but assertive. Nothing is out of your reach just because you are a female. 3. Comfort Zone: In Indian culture, we are all one big family, in theory. Every elder is your grandparent, every man is your uncle, every woman is your aunty, every child you meet at the playground can be a bhaiya or didi. We take comfort in these labels because they engender a sense of community and safety. And undeniably, many of us who grew up in India fondly share nostalgia of playing outside late into the night, running freely into a neighbor's flat and sharing a meal with them, like members of our family. While I appreciate this value of community, genuinely, I would be naïve to think that this community always equals safety. The truth is that you do not demonstrate respect for someone simply by labeling them as a relative. Sometimes this can blur the lines for you on who can and cannot be trusted and could put you in a vulnerable situation when you feel upset or threatened by someone. So beti, know this: You should respect elders for their age and experience and respect your teachers as people who impart knowledge to you. But also trust your instinct. You are never too young to know your own comfort zone and if someone makes you uncomfortable, speak up loudly, no matter who that person may be. Disregard any label we have assigned for them, as a relative, an elder, a teacher, a community or religious leader; disregard our relationship with them; disregard any other notion that may fog up your instincts and know that I trust you. Do not doubt for a second that you are my priority, and I will do all that I can to protect you. 4. Life Partner and Marriage:  Find a life partner who is worthy of your love and your intellect. Someone who encourages you to dream and supports you turning your dreams into reality, someone who knows unquestionably that your aspirations are just as important as his. And if you find such a person and your relationship turns into marriage, I imagine that will be one of the happiest days of my life. Indian marriages, even in the U.S., are known for being extraordinary, with celebrations lasting several days and guest lists so long that the event can rarely be called ""intimate."" And, in the name of tradition, oh, the giving of ""gifts!"" India has made illegal the giving of dowry at a marriage, but ask any Indian and they will tell you it still goes on, within every social class, every caste and at every level of education. Sometimes the groom's family is explicit in their demands; at other times, the bride's family is ready with the gifts, complicit in assigning a value to their own daughter. As though without such gifts, their daughter would not be worth marrying. As though marriage is worth the financial woes suffered by far too many brides' families. And it happens in Indian-American families too, if for no other reason, then because ""that's the way it is."" In addition to paying for the bride's trousseau and the wedding, the bride's family may give sets of jewelry, or furniture for the new home or gifts for the in-laws. We don't call it dowry, of course not; but if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck ...So, beti, at your wedding, there will be no giving of solicited ""gifts."" Not in the name of religion or culture, tradition or society. Anyone lucky enough to share his life with you should accept you as you are, knowing that his life will only improve with you in it. You will contribute to his happiness just as he will to yours. I am passing no burden on to him and he is doing me no favors by marrying you. And for those same reasons, if ever you find yourself in an unhappy in your marriage, know that, without a doubt, you can return home to me. Your marriage to someone does not change that we are family. (And if your life partner is a woman, the above still applies, every word.)My values stem from my upbringing in India and the U.S., taking from each qualities that have allowed me to be not just the best woman, but the best person I can be. As proud as I am of my Indian ancestry, the truth is that Indian society, in India and abroad, has skeletons, some in the closet, but many out in broad daylight. And if we continue to pretend that they do not exist or to excuse their existence in the name of tradition, then shame on us. Our children are impressionable and what we say and do impacts them. I want my daughter to know that while she could not choose her Indian ancestry, she can choose how it impacts her life. I want her to know that she is enough as she is and no one else need set cultural boundaries for her to stay within or limits for her to cross. Because what good is it raising a ""cultured girl"" if that very culture is holding her back in a man's world?A shorter version of this post first appeared at India Abroad."

The program ended and I was just about to turn off the car when the CD continued with some bonus material. Wayne began telling the story of hating his father for deserting him, his brothers and his mother when he was a little boy. I had heard this story before and almost stepped out of the car. Instead, something said, listen, and listen deeply. I did. As the story unfolded, my tears began. This time I allowed the story into my heart, not just my intellect.  Credits: Adria Firestone as Abuela in La Vida Breve, Debra Hesser, photographerIn each cell, I felt the sadness and anguish of my child-self as I heard my mother's voice tell anyone she met, ""You know, I never wanted a child. She's a miracle."" And then proudly, ""I didn't hold her or name her for two weeks."" In truth, she never did. My mother fed and clothed me and gave me a rainbow of antibiotics to fight my asthma, but her angry care turned into possession when she discovered I had talent. Then she wanted me to have beautiful clothes for my performing and she scraped money together so I could have voice lessons. At the age of five I was modeling, by 10, I was on stage performing. I was an attention magnet -- just what her desperate unhappiness needed. Her pathological narcissism kept me a prisoner with no friends, no freedom and no rights. Anything or anyone I loved, she removed from my life.   She was so busy bragging to the people around her when I performed, I wonder if she ever actually heard me sing. The only times she listened, she would dissolve in tears. She talked constantly about my brilliance and my perfection to anyone who would listen. My cousin and so many others told me they hated me before they ever met me because of the picture she painted. For me, the scenario was very different: I was Cinderella. It was utterly crazy-making. The stage was my refuge and the only recreation I was allowed. I was groomed and paraded out to dazzle. Both of my parents tried to destroy every relationship I had. They tried to damage my professional career when I escaped from their clutches and went to Italy to live and study. My father was a con man and it must have been tough to lose one of his shiniest lures. They both allowed and condoned my abuse. I was never safe. They stole from me, forged my grandmother's will, publicly disowned me and yet showed up in formal clothing, wearing the costume of loving parents at my Florida Grand Opera debut as Dalila in Samson et Dalila.  Credits: Adria Firestone as Dalila in Samson et Dalila, Christopher Doig as Samson, William Long, photographerWayne Dyer's story called up memories that had hardened into protective armor. I felt as though my chest was cracking open. Neither of my parents knew what love was. My father was deserted by his mother when he was a child. He ran away to Havana at 15 and a prostitute helped him survive. My mother was abused and her mother didn't protect her. Abuse is a poisonous, never-ending legacy unless it is dragged out into the sunlight and healed. They did the best they could but I carried the scars and repeated the patterns until I worked on healing. The work never ends.When I left the stage, and no longer had the refuge of performance, it took almost superhuman force to tamp down my energy, my fury and finally hide my beauty under layers of fat so I would at last, be safe. I pushed the passion of performing and even listening to music, out of my life. The years of sadness poured down my face in hot tears as I listened to Wayne's voice. Like him, I carried so much anger, so much hatred and it was draining my life of joy and success. I couldn't move. I sat in my car for a very long time. I managed to finish teaching my classes and dragged myself to rehearsal for the faculty recital that night. I was exhausted and nervous about singing music I had never performed before. My first song was Federico Garcia Lorca's setting of Nana de Sevilla, a lullaby and antique folk song.Finally, I was on stage: my home, my safe haven, and the place where for over forty years, I transformed pain into beauty. No one was more surprised than I, when I heard myself say these words to my audience: This is a lullaby for an unwanted child. I had a mother who couldn't love me because her own wounding was so overwhelming. Tonight I sing for her. Mother, this is for you.As I sang the Moorish melody, I was lost in pain, in love and finally at peace with one of my greatest tormentors and one of my greatest teachers. Bless you, fragile, mad, sensitive being. You gave me the challenge of a lifetime and I survived. In one perfect instant, the healing of my own heart held you safe in my arms, so I could let you go. The words and melody of an Andalusian folk song reached out over the years and healed the mother -- and the child."

(AP) — A man who spent nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row was freed Friday after prosecutors finally acknowledged that the only evidence they had against him couldn't prove he committed the crime.Ray Hinton, 58, walked out of the Jefferson County Jail in Birmingham and hugged his tearful family members. ""Thank you Lord, thank you Jesus said his sister, Darlene Gardner, as she embraced him.""I shouldn't have sat on death row for 30 years,"" Hinton told reporters. ""All they had to do was test the gun.""Hinton was convicted of the 1985 murders of two Birmingham fast-food restaurant managers. Crime scene bullets were the only evidence linking him to the crime.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that Hinton had ""constitutionally deficient"" representation at his initial trial because Hinton's defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only $1,000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution testimony about the bullets. The only defense expert willing to take the job at that price struggled so much to answer questions on cross-examination that jurors chuckled at his responses.Attorney Bryan Stevenson, director of the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative, said he was quickly able to independently re-test the gun and prove there was no match to the fatal bullets after taking on the case 16 years ago.He pressed the state ever since to re-examine the evidence, but officials refused. Only while preparing for a retrial did the state test the bullets again, failing to prove a link to Hinton's mothers revolver. Only then did they move to dismiss the case.""He was convicted because he was poor,"" Stevenson said outside the jail.Hinton said he would continue to pray for the victims' families, since the state miscarried justice for them as well.""They had every intention of executing me for something I didn't do,"" Hinton said.Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

25,COLLEGE,Why Students At The University Of Washington Want To Put Their Phones Away,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-of-washington-unplug_n_7000260.html,,2015-04-03,"'Silhouette of George Washington statue at University of Washington campus in Seattle, WA at night, sculpted by Lorado Taft (1860-1936) in 1909.Other images of the University of Washington:'",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae572f200000e500ff4283.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For almost a decade, David Levy has taught a course at the University of Washington's Information School called ""Information and Contemplation."" At the beginning of each class, he asks students to pay attention to their breathing. The 20 students in the room can't talk to each other while they do this, and phones and laptops are off limits. But the students aren't complaining. They signed up for this elective class, which starts each session with meditation, and is part of learning to unplug for the course.""For a long time,"" Levy explained to The Huffington Post, ""I've been interested in the question of 'What does it mean to achieve contemplative balance in a culture like ours where people regularly feel overloaded?'""Levy says he wouldn't have incorporated meditation into a required course or a large-scale lecture. He wants students who are open to participating in this practice, which is why he interviews each one before he lets them into the course.""I basically met face-to-face with all potential students before hand,"" Levy said. ""I told them what we were going to be doing is a bit out of the box, so everybody that came into the class was at the very least curious, so there was no real resistance.""Meditation can improve how students perform in college, according to research from George Mason University. A 2013 paper from GMU professor Robert Youmans and then-University of Illinois doctoral student Jared Ramsburg found meditation can also improve test scores for college students, and ""may help students who might have trouble paying attention or focusing"" in class.But Levy's class goes beyond just meditation.The class is described as a ""course that explores how contemplative practices can serve as a lens to observe and critique current information practices and concerns,"" and looks at the ""fragmentation of attention, and the busyness and acceleration of everyday life.""While some professors have spent the past two decades battling to get students to put away their technology and pay attention in class, Levy says he has found that students are increasingly open to learning more about mindfulness practices.""There's a huge demand,"" said Alysha Greig, who is director of the UW Mindfulness Project, ""not just for yoga, but for practices and a lifestyle that encourages students to take a step away from their hectic life.""Greig started a yoga club on campus in 2011. By the fall 2013, 300 students had signed up and the club had to turn more than 100 others away. ""At that point I kind of realized something larger should be put together,"" she said. That's when she started the Mindfulness Project, which conducts student surveys on mental health issues and offers free yoga and meditation classes with the aim of reducing stress on campus.Changing students' usage of technology, Greig said, plays a big role. To that end, the group asks students to take a pledge not to walk around campus with their phones in their hands. ""So many people spend so much time with their technology, it's an underlying craving,"" she said. ""It's easy to go a full day now as a college student without any interaction with another human.""Both Greig and Levy said even when students are interested in learning how to manage stress and reconnect with people, they sometimes need someone to force them to do it. Some of Greig's yoga students say they appreciate her classes because, if nothing else, they put away their phone for a half-hour. But Levy said he prefers that students would put away their phones voluntarily and not just because they are in a class with a ""no tech"" policy. To that end, he tries a variety of policies on device use in his classes before settling on one. Once students decide how much to limit the use of laptops, iPads and smartphones, Levy said, they actually start policing one another. ""A black-and-white argument based on prejudices is not very helpful,"" Levy said. ""I'd much rather have a deeper conversation about when these tools are useful or not. This is what mindfulness is all about: notice what's happening when you're using this tool."""
