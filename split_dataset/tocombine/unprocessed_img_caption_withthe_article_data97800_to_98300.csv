1,HEALTHY LIVING,Behind the Curtain With Dr. Oz,"Dr. Dean Ornish, ContributorFounder and president, Preventive Medicine Research Institute",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/behind-the-curtain-with-d_b_6608128.html,"Implying that absence of a citation in an academic journal means medical advice has no merit is a misleading premise and misses a truth that practicing physicians acknowledge -- at least half the time that we are faced with a clinical decision, strong scientific evidence is lacking.",2015-02-03,"This Jan. 15, 2013, image released by Sony Pictures Television shows actor Charlie Sheen, left, holding a necrotic lung caused by tobacco use, center, and a healthy lung with host Dr. Oz during a taping of ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" in New York. Sheen, who is a heavy smoker, also discusses his manic behavior and anger issues in the episode airing Wednesday, Jan. 16. (AP Photo/Sony Pictures Television, Barbara Nitke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6110dda4280000a3ba7043d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently, an article in the British Medical Journal concluded that evidence supported only 46 percent of the recommendations made on the Dr. Oz show. Headlines proclaimed, ""More than half of Dr. Oz's advice is baseless or wrong!"" What this study didn't mention is that less than half of conventional medical care -- what your doctor tells you -- is based on randomized controlled trials and strong scientific evidence. Much less. For example, the joint cardiovascular practice guidelines of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have become important documents for guiding cardiology practice and establishing benchmarks for quality of care. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reviewed these guidelines and concluded that only 11 percent of the 2,711 guidelines met the A-level of evidence (i.e., strong evidence from randomized controlled trials) and 48 percent met the C-level of evidence (i.e., based on the personal opinions of experts in the field). Not so different than the Dr. Oz level of evidence. No one has a monopoly on truth, and science continues to advance. Yesterday's heresies may be tomorrow's conventional wisdom. As the chief of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital said on my first day of internship, ""Half of what you learn here will be out of date by the time you finish your medical training; the problem is knowing which half."" A little humility goes a long way. Perhaps ironically, this pie chart came from the British Medical Journal's own Clinical Evidence website. This chart indicates that, of about 2,500 conventional medical treatments supported by good evidence, only 15 percent of treatments were rated as beneficial, 22 percent as likely to be beneficial, 7 percent part beneficial and part harmful, 5 percent unlikely to be beneficial, 4 percent likely to be ineffective or harmful, and in the remaining 47 percent the effect of the treatment was ""unknown."" The text says, ""The figures suggest that the research community has a large task ahead and that most decisions about treatments still rest on the individual judgments of clinicians and patients."" A busy heart surgeon may perform 25,000 operations in his or her lifetime. In one show, Dr. Oz reaches almost 3 million people with information that can make a meaningful difference in their lives and staying healthy. He has taught millions of people the basics of a healthy lifestyle: eat well, stress less, move more, love more. He teaches fundamental concepts that make an enormous difference like maintaining a healthy blood pressure, blood sugar, and weight, metrics that are important drivers of reducing chronic diseases and increasing life spans. While there are oceans of data defining ailments like these, it is the practical and often unproven day to day tips affecting behavioral change that audiences are seeking. A typical piece of sensible advice from these shows might be to sneeze into the crook of your elbow, a tip also shared by the Centers for Disease Control. Unfortunately this is an unproven recommendation. When health media delves into alternative medicine, the advice becomes even more difficult to ""prove"" because these traditions do not neatly fit into the randomized clinical trials that we value in conventional medicine. Yet many of these ""unproven"" concepts are inherently accepted by medical professionals.Even the authors of the British Medical Journal article were concerned by how the media reacted to their article. They wrote on the BMJ web site:As an aside, we are somewhat disappointed that the overwhelming commentary seems to be that our study somehow proves that Dr. Oz or the Doctors are quacks or charlatans or worse. Our data in no way supports these conclusions... Implying that absence of a citation in an academic journal means medical advice has no merit is a misleading premise and misses a truth that practicing physicians acknowledge -- at least half the time that we are faced with a clinical decision, strong scientific evidence is lacking. We make these decisions based on our life experience as clinicians and our familiarity with the individual patient. Patients trust this ""best guess"" because it represents an expert opinion and takes into account our cumulative lifetime of first hand subjective experiences with other patients. I realize this truth is unsettling, but healing relationships are built on transparency. Let's all be more humble about the evidence behind medical advice, but also respect the challenges to providing accessible lifestyle guidance. Just like navigating in the open sea, triangulating the information you collect from media with your doctor's advice and some common sense will help map a sound path to safety."

His body was never found, but in 2001 he was declared legally dead.Testimony on Tuesday focused on the morning of May 25, 1979, when the boy was last seen walking to the bus stop.Karen Jansons, the mother of two children who lived in the same neighborhood, testified that she helped look for Patz the day he failed to get on the school bus.Calling Patz ""a beautiful, beautiful boy,"" Jansons recalled once seeing him walking by himself to the corner deli.""My daughter asked why was Etan allowed to walk by himself, and I said I didn't think he should be walking on his own. He is too small,"" she testified.Hernandez confessed in 2012, but his defense says the confession was coerced and that he is mentally ill. In his confession, Hernandez said he lured Patz to the basement of the Soho deli where he worked, strangled him and dumped him in an alley.Hernandez's brother-in-law Juan Santana, who worked at the same deli, took the witness stand in the afternoon and testified that Hernandez had been a good and dependable worker.""For me, he was a good guy all his life,"" he said through an interpreter.Santana recalled that he knew Patz - ""a good kid,"" he said - from his visits to the store with his family. He said he never saw Hernandez talking to children at the store.Hernandez's defense attorneys have placed the blame on another man, Jose Ramos, who dated a Patz family babysitter and was long considered the prime suspect in the case. Ramos has spent 28 years in prison in Pennsylvania for sexually abusing boys.In the aftermath of the boy's disappearance, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Missing Children's Assistance Act. Patz was one of the first missing children whose picture appeared on a milk carton.The trial in state Supreme Court is expected to last three months.

One U.S. refinery is shutting while management takes control of operations at six others after union workers walked out of the plants in the biggest strike since 1980. Photographer: F. Carter Smith/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31af1260000cf008207e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday, when 3,800 members of the United Steelworkers (USW) walked off their jobs at nine oil refineries across the country (including two in my home state of California), it marked the first national oil refinery strike in more than three decades, going all the way back to 1980. Congratulations, USW. With this strike, organized labor is finally showing signs of life.Although industry analysts have pointed out that gasoline prices were already edging upwards several days before the strike, everyone is going to blame the union for any rise in gas pump prices. And why wouldn't they? Unions make excellent scapegoats. Indeed, with the strike only a couple of days old, expect the oil companies to seize this opportunity to raise prices disproportionately.But the facts tell a different story. Looking back to 1980, the year of the last national refinery strike, Phil Flynn, an analyst with the Price Futures Group, noted that even though that strike lasted a whopping three months, it had little effect on gasoline prices. According to Flynn, it raised prices only ""a couple of pennies at best."" The USW called this current strike after rejecting five substandard proposals (the union described the final offer as ""insulting"") from Royal Dutch Shell, the company acting as lead negotiator for the oil industry. In a strategic move, the USW's walkout targeted specific facilities. Among them are the Tesoro Corporation, Exxon Mobil, Marathon Petroleum, and LyondellBasell Industries, facilities stretching from California to Texas and Kentucky.Aware that the oil companies and media will try to portray these union members as greedy bastards, USW spokeswoman Lynne Hancock made it clear that, while hourly wages are a component of these negotiations (as they have been in virtually every contract negotiation in every industry in history), they are not central to the bargain. This shutdown isn't about hourly pay. ""Wages are not a part of this walkout whatsoever,"" she said. Among the issues central to the strike are mandatory employee contributions to medical insurance, continued reductions in headcount (leading to lower staffing, longer hours and more fatigue), and the company's refusal to take seriously the union's request that the membership be trained for jobs that are increasingly being performed by outside contractors.This outside-contractor issue has become a huge deal to unions everywhere. And when it reaches critical mass, it's going to become a huge deal to non-union workers as well. Based on what's occurring in the marketplace, it's the dream of every company to change the status of their workers from ""employee"" to ""independent contractor,"" thereby allowing them not to have to pay for insurance, pensions, vacations or holidays. Once your employees become classified as contractors, all you have to do is give them cash for doing the job. Write them a paycheck and be done with it. And because there's almost always going to be a surplus of workers, market forces are going to constantly drive wages downward. But even on those occasions when employers are required to pay top dollar for workers, the savings in benefits and administrative costs is going to be enormous, which is why the move toward ""de-categorizing"" employees has become so popular.No matter how this USW strike turns out, one hopes it sheds light on what's become a dangerous trend. The notion of loyal employees retiring after working 30 years for the same company is an anachronism. Companies don't want loyalty. They want flexibility. And what they can't get from contractors they'll try and get from robots. It ain't a pretty picture.

In the frenzied moments following their team's feat of capturing the National Football League championship on Sunday, Edelman and Butler stood in front of a TV camera and shouted four words that have become an iconic reaction to milestone achievement: 'We're going to Disneyland!' (Photo by Paul Hiffmeyer/Disneyland via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7782e2200005700dd1254.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tom Brady may have secured the title of MVP at the Super Bowl, but the Patriots' star quarterback says it’s Malcolm Butler, a 24-year-old undrafted rookie, who clinched the ""play of our season"" with his last-minute interception that saved the game for New England on Sunday. In fact, Brady said this week that he wants to give Butler the keys to the truck -- a 2015 Chevy Colorado -- that he received for winning MVP. But just who is Malcolm Butler? His stunning interception transformed him into a hero overnight. His path to glory, however, hasn’t at all been obvious or smooth. Butler's shining moment. Here, he's seen intercepting a pass intended for Ricardo Lockette (L) of the Seattle Seahawks late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015.Butler had a challenging childhood and only started playing football in high school. According to The Clarion-Ledger, he played two seasons at Mississippi's Vicksburg High School, as a freshman and then as a senior, before going on to attend Hinds Community College. The young man's football career came to a screeching halt, however, when he was booted from Hinds after playing just five games. Neither the school nor Butler has given a reason, though he was reportedly charged with possession of drug paraphernalia during that time. Leaving football behind him, Butler went on to work at a Popeyes restaurant in Vicksburg.Shennelle Parker, a manager at the fast food outlet, told the Washington Post that Butler had been a good employee. “He kept the customers happy and pleased. I was always pleased. He was a hard worker. Everybody in here really liked working with him,” she said. But Butler desperately missed football. “That just made me realize how bad I wanted it and how bad I really needed it,” Butler told the Providence Journal last year. “You don’t know how good it is until it’s gone.”Butler was eventually invited back to Hinds, and he played there for another year. He then transferred to the University of West Alabama, a Division II school.“The first thing I want to say is he’s a tremendous young man with a tremendous attitude,” Will Hall, Butler’s coach at West Alabama, told the Washington Post. “Every day he wakes up, every time he runs into somebody he makes their day better. He’s just one of those people.” At West Alabama, Butler excelled on the field, becoming “one of the best cornerbacks in the Gulf Coast Conference,” according to the Providence Journal.It was enough to get noticed by the Patriots, who signed him in May last year as an undrafted free agent. And the rest, as they say, is history.""I guess we're all dealt a hand by the good Lord to play and some of us are dealt a great hand and an easy hand to play, and some of us are dealt a tough hand,"" Hall told AL.com. ""Malcolm wasn't dealt the best of hands, but man, he's played it as well as anyone walking this earth has played it.""Butler told the Providence Journal that he credits perseverance and hard work as the keys to his success. “You’ve just got to take advantage of the great things when they come. It’s been a long road to get here. Some ups, some downs, but I never gave up. I kept pushing and kept believing. I always believed that I could play in this league. It’s just confidence, faith and hard work,” he said. "

free, and Brandon Duncan, who raps as Tiny Doo, has learned that the hard way.Until recently, Mr. Duncan spent eight months in jail on ""gang conspiracy"" charges arising from several shootings in San Diego from May 2013 to February 2014. Prosecutors admit he wasn't at the scene of the crimes, and they have no evidence linking him to the shootings. Mr. Duncan, who has no criminal record, also says he had no knowledge of the crimes. But the district attorney charged him all the same because he raps about shootings.That's not only absurd; it's a blatant violation of the First Amendment.Mr. Duncan, after all, is an artist, whose music reflects what he's seen. ""I'm just painting a picture of urban street life,"" he recently told CNN's Don Lemon. ""The studio's my canvas .... I'm not telling anyone to go out and kill somebody or go do something. I'm not doing anything differently than [Grammy-winning rapper] The Game.""But the San Diego district attorney thinks otherwise. Under an untested law, an ""active participant"" in a ""criminal street gang"" who ""willfully promotes, furthers, assists, or benefits from"" any felony committed by fellow gang members can be charged with ""conspiracy to commit that felony."" Unlike traditional conspiracy, the charge doesn't require any agreement to commit the crime. Instead, it requires either ""promoting, furthering, or assisting"" the crime, which means being a direct accomplice, or knowingly ""benefiting"" from the crime.Whether or not this law can be used to prosecute others, the prosecution is abusing it to charge Mr. Duncan. To ""promote, further, or assist"" means to aid and abet, and there's no evidence he did that. That leaves ""benefit."" The district attorney alleges he has ""benefited"" from shootings committed by unidentified gang members through making a CD called ""No Safety,"" on which he raps about shootings, and through receiving ""praise"" for his music. As the prosecutor admitted, he wouldn't be charged if he sang ""love songs.""That's wrong on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start.This is a textbook case of using a ""gang"" dragnet to over-criminalize people of color. It's not even clear Mr. Duncan is an ""active participant"" in the gang under California law. But even if he is, the prosecution's theory violates the First Amendment by punishing him for the content of his speech. The government can punish crime, but it can't punish speech about crime, even by proven criminals about their own crimes, much less an artist like Mr. Duncan.In striking down a ""Son of Sam"" law, the Supreme Court held that the government can't sequester income from speech based on its content, even speech about crime, because that would punish the speech itself. Under that principle, the government can't prosecute Mr. Duncan for singing about crime or receiving ""benefits"" for doing so. Indeed, this case is even worse, because it involves criminal prosecution, not just loss of income.On the state's theory, it could prosecute a current or former gang member for writing a book,giving an interview to an author, or appearing in a documentary about gang life, as well as a substance abuse counselor who draws on his gang experiences, because they all ""benefit"" from knowledge of crimes committed by gang members.It's all preposterous.The state can't criminalize protected speech, and it can't criminalize Mr. Duncan's music. Thankfully, Mr. Duncan is now free on bail, but he still faces ""gang conspiracy"" charges, which threaten a potential life sentence. The ACLU has filed a brief asking the court to dismiss the charges immediately.In criminal cases, however, the process itself is often the punishment, even without a conviction. Mr. Duncan spent eight months in jail when he never should have been arrested in the first place. The court should stop this case in its tracks and send a clear message that prosecution for protected speech cannot be tolerated.Free speech may not be free, but it's not a crime."

Resentment is not just some feeling we have. It is an emotion that has intentional and cognitive content.,2015-02-03,"FILE - Former police colonel Eugene de Kock arrives at the Pretoria Supreme Court in an armoured police vehicle under police guard at the start of the 18 month trial on 121 charges, including murder, fraud and assault. (AP Photo/ str)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae05b83c000032000b5cb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The South African government has recently granted parole to apartheid assassin, Eugene de Kock. De Kock was once considered the face of evil that tortured and killed dozens of South African activists during the apartheid era. He was sentenced to life in prison, but recently paroled after twenty years. The Justice Minister said that he released de Kock ""in the interest of nation building and reconciliation."" While in prison, de Kock was visited by some of his victims' relatives and sought their forgiveness. Jane Quinn, the sister of one of his victims, noted: ""I don't think we should be undoing the process of punishment for apartheid crimes before we have completed actually doing them."" On the other hand, some of Eugene de Kock's other victims' relatives have said they have forgiven him. What is Forgiveness?We all have been admonished to forgive wrongdoers. Some of us have had the experience of an apologetic person pleading for our forgiveness. The Christian scriptures instruct followers to forgive. Self-help gurus argue that unforgiveness ""eats you up inside."" On the other hand, forgiveness sets you free. But what exactly is forgiveness? Enlightenment philosopher, Immanuel Kant, describes forgiveness as ""remission of compensation or payment."" His definition fits with the Christian account of forgiveness, which is the releasing of a monetary or moral debt. A popular definition of forgiveness is ""letting go."" This process of ""letting go"" entails getting rid of the resentment you feel towards the wrongdoer. On the contrary, the 18th century moralist, Joseph Butler, describes forgiveness as not having hasty and irrational resentment towards the wrongdoer. Instead of breaking ties with resentment, Butler believes that forgiveness includes having appropriate resentment towards the wrongdoer as well as benevolence and goodwill.Contemporary philosopher, Lucy Allais, notes that forgiveness is distinct from excusing, justifying, and accepting -- for all of these are ways of coming to see that there is nothing to forgive. For her, a person who forgives knows that wrongdoing is not excusable, justifiable, or acceptable and yet they still forgive. Forgiveness is seeing that blame is appropriate. It does not fail to take wrongdoing seriously nor does it fail to hold others accountable. Allais claims that forgiveness starts where appropriate resentment begins, for it involves giving up this appropriate resentment. For Allais, forgiveness is a way of ""seeing with feeling."" You see the wrongdoer better than their actions warrant seeing them although forgiving them doesn't change your view that their actions were inexcusable, unjustifiable, and unacceptable. A More Radical View of ForgivenessMy own view of forgiveness challenges the idea that there should even exist such a concept. Like Butler, I believe deliberative and appropriate resentment is an emotion we have that has the power to help us prevent wrongdoing and also bring wrongdoers to justice. Joseph Butler argues:And after an injury is done and there is a necessity that the offender should be brought to justice; the cool consideration of reason, that the security and peace of society requires examples of justice should be made, might indeed be sufficient to procure laws to be enacted, and sentence passed: but is it that cool reflection in the injured person, which, for the most part, brings the offender to justice? Or is it not resentment and indignation against the injury and the author of it? I am afraid there is no doubt, which is commonly the case.I think Joseph Butler will agree with bell hooks, that if we view our indignation or resentment as evil, we will also lose the vision that it takes to bring about transformation. I value resentment for these reasons and more. Resentment is an indicator that moral judging is taking place. Resentment is not just some feeling we have. It is an emotion that has intentional and cognitive content. It is a judgment that someone or something has gone wrong. Resentment is also tied to self-respect. Someone who has resentment towards a wrongdoer is asserting, in some ways, his or her own self-respect or the respect of others. They are saying that a person has a right to be valued and respected. A wrongdoer violates the respect of others when he or she wrongs them. Resentment towards that wrongdoer is an announcement of and demand for respect. This is why Frederick Douglas felt that he had gained his manhood in his fight with his master, Covey. His anger and resentment was a sign of him asserting his own self-respect to a man that had no respect for a young, black slave. It is for these reasons that I cannot view forgiveness as a letting go of resentment or as modifying resentment towards a wrongdoer. Appropriate resentment plays too much of healthy role for the victim. I also believe in justice, although the details of what justice (i.e. punishment or corrections) should look like extend far beyond the focus of this essay. Someone may get concerned and ask, ""What about peace and love?"" Allais suggests that we should forgive where there is an ongoing relationship where you want to continue to relate to each other and move forward. For her, in our private relationships this will be looking at the wrongdoer in a better light although one does not excuse what they have done. I agree that if you want to continue in a close relationship with another, appropriate resentment must be addressed. On the contrary, instead of erasing it, I only think appropriate resentment needs to be modified. Just as Allais argues that forgiveness is not obligatory or required, we are also not required to continue these ongoing relationships. We should have the right to maintain appropriate resentment and continue with our lives, absent of the wrongdoer, and have our behavior viewed as virtuous and ethical in spite of terminating or modifying the relationship. Forgiveness and JusticeBut what about public cases like the example of South Africa? It is cases like these that really grind my gears! Historically, religious institutions and governments have persuaded the oppressed to forgive the oppressor. This has been preached in the name of Christian ethics and in the name of reconciliation within the state. The oppressor is exempt from state prosecution or is given much mercy, while the oppressed are persuaded to undergo the psychological challenge of forgiving them. This does not extend just to South Africa. Victims of genocide in other parts of the world have been asked to forgive their murdering neighbors. The descendants of slaves have been asked to forgive former slave owning families. There has been lots of telling the oppressed what to do, while the oppressor usually goes free. Those who proselytize forgiveness on behalf of the state act as if forgiveness is some magic word. If ""I forgive you"" is spoken, somehow some believe, it will erase history, lighten the oppressors' guilt, and make the world peaceful and jolly again. We ask the oppressed to do so much: take their abuse, survive their abuse, don't seek revenge for the abuse, and then forgive those who abuse them. What are the oppressors doing? In South Africa they are getting out of jail early for slaughtering black lives or never facing prosecution at all. Where is the justice, the moral judgment, and the respect for victims? Let's Get RealIf governments were really keen on forgiveness and reconciliation, they would release all of the men and women locked up in prisons. But they won't. Most of these prisoners are not former state workers who followed government orders or once embodied racist state ideology. Most of them are not privileged. They are citizens: poor, political prisoners, or people of color who something illegal (maybe) and got caught. It seems as if the message is that only the once powerful wrongdoers deserve and require forgiveness and only that forgiveness is needed to move the nation forward. As for the reconciliation of these ""other criminals"", they need to do their time. This is twisted logic if you ask me. The purpose of reconciliation and forgiveness rhetoric is to excuse state atrocities, erase the state's guilt, restore their image, and go on with life as usual -- not to reconcile hearts and strengthen communities. This is a fairy tale way of governing people. It is also a biased way. Until countries get serious about wrongdoing, don't mention forgiveness to the oppressed. Accept their anger, their resentment, and their demand for self-respect. Don't ask them to do any emotional or psychological work. It is you who have work to do. Administer justice! Fix inequalities! Right Wrongs! Prove that all lives matter! And then maybe we can start talking about ""feelings."""

(http://bloom.bg/1D7QnUa)Sprint and RadioShack have had talks about co-branding some of the stores, Bloomberg reported, citing two anonymous sources.

Now -- a month later -- I'm still rescuing that dog.Bambi, my beautiful two-year-old pup, is a Pit Bull mix. The implications of rescuing a Pit Bull are great -- and widespread. (And I am not using ""great"" in the good way.) Before taking Bambi into my home, I was ready for the wide array of problems new rescues often have -- I put my shoes on a higher shelf, moved toxic cleaning products into closed cabinets, and let the upstairs and downstairs neighbors in my apartment know about our new roommate. What I was not expecting, and what I was not ready for, was The Great Pit Bull Bias. As a dog lover -- worshiper, even -- I was aware that pitties have a bad reputation. But I never bought into the hype. In my experience, then and now, I've found dogs to be exceedingly trainable. Dogs owe their existence to humans and, as such, are malleable to their humans' needs. And, while I think it's a safe assumption to say that most people -- dog owners or not -- believe that most dogs are trainable, the same doesn't apply to Pit Bulls.Since rescuing Bambi, I have gotten more dirty looks than ever before. On an average walk, anywhere between four and 10 people cross the street when they see us coming. Growing up owning dogs, I've become accustomed to comments like, ""Beautiful dog!"" and questions like, ""Can I say hi?"" This has happened only twice since I've taken Bambi in -- and we walk miles around south Brooklyn everyday.People say that Pit Bulls are killers -- that they were bred to fight. The truth? The aggression grade given to the American Pit Bull Terrier, according to ATTS (American Temperament Test Society, Inc.) which tests for dog-to-human aggression, is 86.8 percent. That's just a hair above the Golden Retriever -- which tested at 85.2 percent. That said, breeds are predisposed to certain traits -- just as they are to particular health problems. Bulldogs have skin ailments. Labradors love everyone. Pit Bulls are aggressive towards other dogs. Are all of the aforementioned statements true all of the time? Of course not. But, just as someone adopting a Bulldog needs to be ready to deal with their possible health problems, someone rescuing a Pit Bull needs to know that socialization training may be necessary.Pit Bull puppies, adopted and socialized as youngins, are no more dangerous than any other breed. Unfortunately, however, I didn't adopt Bambi as a puppy. I adopted Bambi at two years old -- after having been abandoned (tied to a fence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn), abused and taken away from her puppies. When I first got Bambi, she was still producing milk. Had she not been taken in by a family that spayed her, vaccinated her, and found her a suitable home she would have been put down immediately. Bambi was not a fighting dog, but she may have been used to breed them. Her scraped elbows and cigarette-burned skin are reminders of her past -- as are her territorial tendencies. After having Bambi for a few weeks -- once she became comfortable in my home and with me -- she began displaying aggressive behavior towards strangers coming into my apartment. I don't want her bad behavior to speak for the breed -- rather, to behavioral issues born from neglectful and abusive homes. More than that, though, I don't want her to have any bad behavior. I want her to help fight The Great Pit Bull Bias. I want Bambi to be an ambassador for the breed. It's hard to believe that the same pup that lets me sit her on my lap as if I were a mall Santa, also charges at strangers coming into the home. But Bambi is good. She is obedient, affectionate, housebroken -- she just has one behavioral issue. But it is a big one -- and one that cannot go unfixed. So I coughed up the fee for an initial behavioral consultation with a fabulous NYC trainer who came recommended from Pit-owners. She agrees -- Bambi can be rehabilitated. But she'll need a couple additional training sessions and, of course, a commitment from me to work as hard as I possibly can to get her to where she needs to be. But I love Bambi. And Bambi loves me. And, after just one training session, she's making great progress. We work together everyday. So I continue to save the money necessary for the remaining training sessions just as I continue to dedicate my time and effort. Both are necessary to finish rescuing Bambi. Because the truth is -- she needs it. There is no future for Pit Bulls with aggression problems. The Great Pit Bull Bias means that Bambi needs our help in order to live. I'm stressed. I'm scared. I'm nervous. I'm also confident -- in Bambi and in myself."
14,SPORTS,Why Rafael Nadal is (Still) my Hero and is the True GOAT,"Thaddeus McCarthy, ContributorConnector",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-rafael-nadal-is-my-he_b_6529870.html,"In this article I will start with stating why Rafael Nadal is my hero, why he should be all of ours, and why he is the greatest example in tennis today of prevailing against human suffering.",2015-02-02,"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - JANUARY 27: Rafael Nadal of Spain plays a backhand in his quarterfinal match against Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic during day nine of the 2015 Australian Open at Melbourne Park on January 27, 2015 in Melbourne, Australia. (Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb777bc210000d601c8f9c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am writing this before the outcome of the Australian Open Final. But I will say now that no matter what happens in the final does not change the fact that Rafael Nadal is my hero and deserves the title of GOAT. In this article I will start with stating why he is my hero, why he should be all of ours, and why he is the greatest example in tennis today of prevailing against human suffering. My other big piece of this article will be about why he, more than anyone else deserves the title of GOAT. Simply put, Nadal is my hero because he has overcome struggles. But much more than me, is that he has proved the naysayers wrong. While it's true that he always had the talent, he initially was confronted by the problem that he was for a long time, much younger than many of the other players in tournaments. When he was eight he won the under-12s Balearic Islands Championship. Prior to entering, there were many that doubted whether a boy so young could win such a prestigious age-grade tournament against boys of much older. After all, 3-4 years at that age often seems like an eternity. The biggest moments in Nadal's career when he has overcome the naysayers though, have been when he has been crippled by injury. Especially in 2005 when he injured his tarsal scaphoid bone in his foot. His doctor said that he wouldn't be able to play tennis again. His own father said that he may need to choose another sport. But overcome this injury Nadal did, with the help of some specially made shoe soles. In 2012 it was his knee that crippled him, an injury that may have been caused by the soles that have spared him from aggravating his tarsal scaphoid bone in his foot. People thought he was finished, and that finally this was the injury that would bring him down. But as we all saw in 2013, he swept the field in winning two Slams and taking home the U.S. Open title.The frequently used point to the reason as to why Nadal cannot be classified as the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) is that he doesn't have the record number of Slams. The argument always used when people (rightly) classify Jack Nicklaus as the greatest golfer. The problem with this though, is that tennis is more of a one on one game than golf. Essentially in golf, you are always playing against yourself. In tennis you are always playing against the guy on the other side of the net, which is why the head-to-head records in tennis are so hugely important. And Nadal is the only top player in this era who has a positive record against all of the other top players. The only other player who can rightly displace Nadal from this argument of the GOAT is Rod Laver. And the reason people will use this is that he won the only open-era Slam (all four) in 1969. This is a reasonable argument. But when did having one great year ever mean that someone is the GOAT? Again, to answer this I will turn back to golf. Even though Tiger Woods has achieved an awful lot in the sport, there are still not many people around who rank him as greater than Jack. If one great year is argument enough for inclusion in the GOAT category, then Bobby Jones' Grand Slam in 1930 would place him as the GOAT. But when do we ever hear his name mentioned. The other big argument for Jack is that not only did he win 18 majors, he also came in second place 19 times. Federer has finished second in eight Slams, while Nadal has gotten second six times. Still, Federer has the got the numbers on him in this category. What now needs to be taken into consideration is that Nadal has often been hampered by injury. He has therefore missed a lot of Slams, he has been taken out early in some others, due often to injury.If Nadal was sitting on a total right now of eight Slams, I don't think he would deserve so much discussion in the GOAT argument. But as he sits on a total of 14, his numbers aren't too shabby. He has built up a very respectable haul, despite being hampered by injury. There is also the fact that he has won all four Slams, the Davis Cup, Olympic Gold Medal, and a record number of Masters Series titles. In fact, I would argue that his high placing in total number of Slams won (2nd equal), his first in Masters series titles won, and his career Slam; places him in a higher category than Sampras, Borg, Connors, or Agassi. When it comes to deciding on him vs. Federer, their Grand Slam and Masters Series titles I think balance each other out. I think that his superior head-to-head record against Federer places him in the better position. When you add to this the factor that the common man can find more in common with Nadal than in Federer, this adds further weight to the Nadal argument. After all, how many of us are as naturally talented as Federer clearly is? It is said that Federer doesn't have to train as much as the other players. Wouldn't we all love to hardly train, and just be great? I'm sure we would, but the fact is that for 99 percent of us, we have to struggle and fight our way through the world and to forge our place in it. Every time he goes out on the court we can all see Nadal doing this. Nadal is the ultimate fighter in tennis, and never gives up a point lightly. It was sad to see him having an off day against Thomas Berdych in the quarterfinals. He likely was affected by his back injury from last year and his subsequent lack of quality match practice. He is at a time now where he will try to come back from injury. He has done it many times before, and many fans will assume that he should just be able to do it again. Whether he does or doesn't, as a fan, I still and always will regard him as a personal hero of mine. He is in my eyes, the Greatest Player of All Time."

The Communist leadership of coastal Zhejiang province has declared it will double down on a long-standing but little-enforced rule that bars religious believers from joining the Party.That move comes amid a widely reported tightening of the ideological screws in Chinese universities and across the media landscape. Professors across the country have reportedly been fired for speaking against the Communist Party, and the country's education minister declared last week that China should ""never let textbooks promoting Western values appear in our classes."" December also saw scattered protests by Chinese students demanding an end to Christmas celebrations on Chinese campuses, a move supported by authorities in one Zhejiang city. One professor at a Party-affiliated university speculated that the recent moves to bar believers from joining the Party are meant to guard against “penetration of Western hostile forces,"" according to a Global Times report.Young Chinese worshippers attend the Christmas Eve mass at a Catholic church in Beijing, Dec. 24, 2014.Last week's declaration from Zhejiang province’s party committee called for CCP groups to organize activities where members disavow religious belief. It also stated that all applicants to the Party must first be screened for evidence of religious faith or participation, and rejected if any such evidence is found. Party ideology is rooted in Marxist-Leninist thought, which decries religion as a delusion that distracts the oppressed masses from demanding their fair share.Religious believers have long been technically barred from joining the CCP, but the prohibition was only loosely enforced. The CCP has more than 84 million members, many of whom entered the Party during school and have little if any political involvement. Entrance is competitive, and membership often serves more as a bullet point on a resume than a declaration of political or religious fealty.If actually carried out, the restrictions would exclude participants in an ongoing religious revival from joining the country's ruling party. Christianity has seen tremendous growth in China in recent years, and some reports point to a growing official acceptance and even encouragement of religious belief.A villager stands next to a demolished Christian church outside the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province.But Party propaganda has also taken a hard line against the influence of ideas and values perceived as being foreign to China. So-called “Western values” like freedom of speech and multiparty democracy have been denigrated by leaders and state-controlled media, and religions such as Christianity have also been caught in the crosshairs. The Zhejiang city of Wenzhou is home to a large number of Christian churches, more than 200 of which have been targeted for demolition in the past year after being classified as “illegal structures.” Wenzhou also made headlines by reportedly banning Christmas celebrations in schools this year.China recognizes five “official” religions -- Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism -- but many believers who worship outside of state-sanctioned institutions are subject to periodic crackdowns. Buddhism and Taoism have received far greater official support due to their deep roots in Chinese culture, but during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and '70s, even these religions saw their temples ransacked and desecrated as relics of “superstitious” and “feudal” thinking."
