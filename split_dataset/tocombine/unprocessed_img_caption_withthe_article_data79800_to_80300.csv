1,BUSINESS,The Controversial New Argument For The Fed To Raise Interest Rates,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-controversial-new-argument-for-the-fed-to-raise-interest-rates_us_55e0aa23e4b0aec9f3532930,Some analysts argue that low interest rates leave the central bank ill-prepared for the next recession.,2015-08-28,"<p>Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has indicated that the Fed will soon be ready to raise interest rates. The Fed's desire to increase rates could reflect concerns about its ability to deal with a future recession.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e0ac301d00002f00146349.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Proponents of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike have a new argument: Raise rates now so they are high enough for the central bank to cut them later when the economy begins shrinking. But many analysts believe the risks of precipitating a slowdown with a premature rate increase are greater than those posed by keeping rates low, and say the central bank has tools other than cutting interest rates at its disposal in the event of another downturn.The Federal Reserve has kept its main interest rates, which banks use to lend to one another and determine the cost of credit throughout the rest of the economy, at or near zero since December 2008. The central bank has maintained the low rates so as not to disrupt the country's recovery from the largest financial crisis and recession in decades.But several current and former senior economic officials told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month that the virtually unprecedented, prolonged period of near-zero rates risks depriving the Fed of the “ammunition” to address the next recession -- let alone another financial crisis. The Fed's primary method of economic stimulus, they note, has traditionally been cutting interest rates, something that is not possible if rates are already so low.That could force the government to rely disproportionately on fiscal stimulus, these experts warn, holding a recovery hostage to a partisan ideological divide that has paralyzed Congress and shows no signs of abating. None of the officials who spoke to the Wall Street Journal explicitly called for an interest rate increase in order to keep the Fed’s options open for the next crisis. The main reason that Fed officials publicly provide for a rate hike is still that they believe price inflation is on track to hit the Fed’s 2 percent target. (William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, signaled on Wednesday that the the Fed was reconsidering a September interest rate hike after several days of volatility in the stock market.)But Fed watchers believe that a desire to replenish the Fed’s proverbial firepower for the next recession is part of the motivation of Fed officials who want to “normalize” -- i.e., increase -- rates.Narayana Kocherlakota, the outgoing president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, vehemently opposes an interest rate hike in the near future. Kocherlakota nonetheless believes that his central bank colleagues’ perception that low interest rates have given the Fed less “monetary policy ‘space’” will prompt them to raise rates sooner and higher than is desirable.Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager and senior research analyst at Brandywine Global, a Philadelphia-based asset management firm, also said those concerns are part of the Fed’s calculus. “Yes, the [Fed would] like to remove emergency-level monetary stimulus to build up ammunition for the next slowdown in the U.S. economy,” McIntyre told The Huffington Post. “It would be a net positive to move us off of zero interest rates to build up some ammunition so they can cut them when it slows down.” Many economists insist, however, that these fears are misplaced. They instead argue that the best way for the Fed to prepare for the next recession is to prevent the economy from slowing down too soon in the near term.“I would much rather have the Fed engage in slowdown and recession prevention by getting us to reach levels at which a rate hike would not be premature,” Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said earlier this week.If the Fed raises rates in the coming months to give itself leeway for the next recession, Bivens warned, it risks “creating the crisis you are trying to have tools to fight against.”Bivens is one of a number of liberal-leaning economists and activists who argue that the economy is still far from full employment. They want the Fed to wait for widespread wage growth to take hold before raising rates, and they were in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Thursday and Friday to make their case to Fed officials directly.When the economy slows down more substantially, Bivens said, the Fed could still stimulate growth using quantitative easing, the massive asset purchasing program it initiated during the most recent recession after interest rates had already bottomed out. There are other even less conventional techniques available to the central bank, like instituting negative interest rates, which would effectively charge banks for depositing their money rather than lending. It is an idea that former Fed chair Ben Bernanke told The Wall Street Journal has merit.Richard Parker, an economist at Harvard, agrees with Bivens and other economists that middle- and lower-income workers have yet to share in the gains of the current recovery, but is less worried about the damaging effect of a rate hike.Instead, Parker believes that lawmakers and activists concerned about low wage growth should focus on changing the regulatory and fiscal policies that he believes would have a bigger impact. Parker supports a “retained earnings tax” that would penalize corporations for hoarding cash for stock buybacks and other actions “meant to bolster share prices (and hence bonuses)” that do little for the real economy.And while Parker acknowledges that partisan gridlock makes the prospects of pro-growth fiscal policy dim at the federal level, he sees the success of efforts to raise the minimum wage at the state and local level as a model for incremental progress. “It is beginning to look like the early Progressive Era, when states were the laboratories for democracy,” he said.

The study reveals the surprising amount of microbial diversity in the average household, and what kinds of secrets those microbes hold.What exactly can scientists learn about you from a single sample of the dust in your house?""We can, to some degree, figure out where you live (or at the least the climate where you live), [and] who you might live with (including dogs and cats),"" Dr. Noah Fierer, a microbial ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. ""More generally, we can figure out what potential allergens you may be exposed to inside your home.""For the study, the researchers examined roughly 1,200 homes across the U.S., analyzing the indoor and outdoor dust at each home.The researchers found that, on average, most homes contain more than 5,000 different species of bacteria and around 2,000 species of fungi. But don't panic. As Fierer told the Los Angeles Times, most of these household microbes are completely harmless, and some may even be beneficial.The researchers also analyzed which factors influence each home's different fungal and bacterial communities.""For fungi, the biggest influence appears to be where your house is located,"" Fierer told HuffPost. ""For bacteria, it appears to be the human and non-human animals (i.e. dogs and cats) that you live with.""(Story continues below.)For instance, bacteria found in your home can vary depending on the number of men and women who live there, Live Science reported. Clues to the men-to-women ratio in a home can be found in many of the local microbe populations, including skin, vaginal and even armpit bacteria.Meanwhile, the kinds of fungi residing in and around your home will vary according to your location. For example, you get different kinds of fungi if you live near a beach than you would if you live in the mountains.""One of the key takeaways is that if you want to change what you breathe inside your house, you would either have to move very far away or change the people and the pets you live with,"" Albert Barbarán, a graduate researcher at the university and lead author of the study, said in a press release.The researchers noted that their findings could be used to help forensic investigations, as well as to better our understanding of the microbes that we often forget we share our humble abodes with.“Every day, we’re surrounded by a vast array of organisms in our homes, most of which we can’t see,” Fierer said in the same press release.

Probably not.Would stricter gun laws have saved the lives of many other people? Probably.That’s a fair reading of the latest research -- and something to remember now that Wednesday’s killing of the two television journalists, during a live interview, has politicians and pundits talking about gun violence again.So far, the debate has played out in a familiar fashion. From the White House, Press Secretary Josh Earnest renewed the administration’s call for “commonsense” gun measures, such as extending federal background checks to private gun sales and limiting access to assault weaponry. Via Twitter, Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state and current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said “we must act to stop gun violence, and we cannot wait any longer.”Probably the most impassioned plea for government action came from Andy Parker, Alison’s father, during an interview with CNN: “There has to be a way to force politicians that are cowards and in the pockets of the [National Rifle Association] to come to grips and make sense -- have sensible laws so that crazy people can't get guns.” The opponents of gun legislation also reacted to the shooting, with every major Republican presidential candidate expressing sympathy and offering prayers. But in between the words of solace, some offered warnings about the dangers of new firearms legislation. “It’s not the guns; it’s the people who are committing these crimes,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a leading GOP candidate, told an audience in New Hampshire. “What law in the world could have prevented him from killing them?”Conservative media outlets like the National Review had stronger responses, bemoaning the “tired and opportunistic gun control agenda” and arguing that the kind of legislation now under consideration in Congress probably would not have stopped the suspected killer, Vester Lee Flanagan, from getting a weapon.About the specific circumstances of Wednesday's killing, these conservatives have a point. Law enforcement officials have told media outlets that Flanagan used a Glock pistol without a high-capacity magazine -- and that he bought the weapon from a licensed gun store, after passing a federal background check. A letter that Flanagan apparently faxed to ABC News earlier in the week suggested he planned the shooting in advance, while reports of his past behavior toward co-workers raise the possibility that he may have had some mental health problems.But the video of Parker and Ward’s slaying, which played over and over on social media, merely made vivid something that happens all the time, even though few Americans see it. On Wednesday alone, at least 13 other people died from gunshots, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation that tracks shootings around the nation. In 2013, the last year for which federally collected data is available, 33,636 people in the U.S. died.No other developed country has a gun homicide or gun violence rate even approaching that level. (That’s true even though the rate is now much lower than it was in the early 1990s, likely because crime overall has declined.) And while America’s high rate of gun violence undoubtedly reflects many factors, researchers like David Hemenway, a widely cited professor from the Harvard School of Public Health, have found a clear, strong relationship between gun ownership and gun-related deaths. In places where more people have guns, more people get killed by them.As Hemenway and others scholars are quick to acknowledge, this correlation does not prove that the availability of guns actually causes more gun deaths -- mainly because, as so commonly happens in social sciences, it’s impossible to run the kind of controlled experiments that would allow scholars to rule out other factors unrelated to the availability of firearms. But their research strengthens the case for a causal link. Among other things, several scholars have found that states and countries with higher rates of gun killings do not have correspondingly high rates for other types of killings. In other words, when guns aren’t available, people don’t simply react by killing with different weapons. They actually kill less frequently. (There's also strong evidence linking gun ownership to suicide rates, which makes sense given that suicide is frequently an impulsive act, although the international data on suicide is fuzzy because different countries measure it -- and think of it -- in different ways.)Demonstrating that gun laws might cut down on gun deaths is even more difficult than establishing a link between firearms ownership and the extent of violence. But here, too, academics have recently produced important scholarship that bolsters the case for more regulation. One recent study examined the murder rate in Missouri after that state repealed a law mandating background checks for all gun purchases, including ones that the federal system does not currently cover. The homicide rate increased once the gun law came off the books, the researchers found, even as the homicide rate in neighboring states -- and the U.S. as a whole -- was declining.“There is strong evidence to support the idea that the repeal of Missouri’s handgun purchaser licensing law contributed to dozens of additional murders in Missouri each year since the law was changed,” Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and lead author on the study, said at the time. Another leading researcher, Philip Cook from Duke University, told the New Republic that Webster’s paper “is probably the strongest evidence we have that background checks really matter.”Still more persuasive evidence on the effect of gun control comes from Australia, which -- following a highly publicized mass killing in the 1990s -- banned many types of weapons, introduced a more restrictive permit system, and then launched a buy-back program in which states paid gun owners for turning in weapons that the new laws made illegal. Homicide and suicide rates dropped substantially. And while the murder rates was also dropping before the laws took effect, researchers found that the decline was sharpest for the weapons declared illegal and in those states reporting the highest buyback rates. (Zach Beauchamp, of Vox, has an excellent summary of that research.)Australia’s gun legislation was stronger than anything likely to get consideration in the U.S. Congress, let alone pass and become law. And expert opinion on gun control is still not unanimous, despite all the recent work. Probably the best-known critic of new laws is John Lott, who has held positions at several top universities and now runs a think tank called the Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott famously published research in the late 1990s suggesting that higher gun ownership actually deters gun violence, because people will use guns in self-defense.But Lott’s own work has come under withering scrutiny, from fellow scholars and in publications like Mother Jones. Lott said that a computer crash destroyed some key pieces of survey data on which he'd based his work; subsequent surveys produced different results, although Lott maintained those results still vindicated his findings. At one point, he even admitted to using a pseudonym to attack his critics in online comments.  (Lott has said his critics misrepresent his findings, and sometimes their own, while ignoring evidence that would show gun laws to be ineffective -- or even counterproductive.)The ambiguity of all evidence on gun violence, including those studies on Australia and Missouri, make it impossible to say definitively that laws would have stopped any individual act of killing. But that’s the self-perpetuating political problem of gun violence. The shootings that feature large numbers of casualties or spectacular circumstances -- like those in Sandy Hook or Aurora, or the incidents on military bases -- become national stories and galvanize the public. The vast majority of killings, which usually take place in the home and are twice as likely to be acts of suicide than murder, barely register. Yet it’s on these routine killings, which happen by the dozens every week, that stronger gun legislation is most likely to have an effect.Of course, the extraordinary and ordinary killings have one thing in common. They all end in a tragedy -- the extinguishing of human life. Wednesday's shooting, and the horrific video that emerged as a result, revealed to many Americans what a tragedy that really is.Also on HuffPost:"

Bob McDonnell (R) got a brief reprieve from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday. Now, he wants a much longer one.The governor-turned-felon is asking Roberts to let him stay out of prison on bail while he pursues a full appeal of his conviction on corruption charges before the Supreme Court. That appeal could take many months or even years.It's been a busy week for the lawyers: On Monday, Roberts -- who handles these kinds of minor requests involving cases from the Virginia-based federal appeals court -- temporarily spared McDonnell from reporting to prison. On Wednesday, the Justice Department's team urged the chief to reverse course. On Thursday, McDonnell's attorneys filed documents attempting to rebut the government's argument.McDonnell's lawyers wrote that they hope the Supreme Court ""will ultimately draw the line between lawful democratic politics and federal criminal corruption with greater care and caution than"" did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which upheld McDonnell's multiple convictions in July.If the 4th Circuit's decision is allowed to stand, McDonnell's lawyers argued, it ""will upend the political process, devastate fundamental First Amendment freedoms, and confer vast discretion on federal prosecutors.""Perhaps. But there's still a way to go before the Supreme Court even considers whether it will review those weighty issues. In the meantime, McDonnell can avoid prison a while longer if Roberts grants him bail.Good luck with that. Federal law allows a defendant appealing his conviction to be released on bail if certain conditions are met. But those conditions are hard to meet, even more so if you're down to asking the Supreme Court for bail.U.S. Law Week editor Kimberly Robinson wrote this week that no Supreme Court justice has granted such a bail application in more than a dozen years and perhaps not in the last 30 years. She pointed to a legal treatise cited by the Justice Department in its filing.In its opposition to McDonnell's request, the government relied on that treatise to remind the justices that ""there is not a single published ... opinion"" that granted such a bail request since 1984 -- the year Congress toughened the law governing the release and detention of federal defendants.Robinson noted that the treatise describes the practice of an individual justice blessing a bail application as ""largely obsolete.""In their Thursday filing, McDonnell's lawyers largely brush aside this history.The reason the justices aren't granting bail may be the strict conditions that must be met: To get bail while the appeals process continues, McDonnell essentially has to convince Roberts that the Supreme Court will take his case. In other words, he has to convince the chief justice that his arguments are legally strong enough that the court will agree to review his case in an upcoming term. These days the justices tend to grant review to only about 70 or so cases each term.But that's not all. McDonnell also has to convince Roberts that his arguments are so good that it's ""likely"" that a majority of the justices will agree to reverse his conviction. That is, that his case is such a slam dunk that he'll win it.Again, good luck with that. Roberts could rule any minute now on McDonnell's bail request. As someone who has shown some restraint in cases of high political salience, he probably won't grant it.Of course, if McDonnell truly believes he did nothing wrong, he need not despair: The Supreme Court could still consider his full appeal while he sits in a federal prison."

But nothing could have prepared her for the devastation the storm brought.Blanche and her family evacuated their home and when they returned a few weeks later they, like so many others in New Orleans, realized they'd lost everything. It was time to start over.During the brief time she and her family lived in a hotel following their evacuation, Blanche took particular note of the Army’s rescue efforts she was seeing portrayed on the news. It really resonated.“They showed me that you can always put in an effort to help someone else and think about other people and not only yourself,” Blanche said. “That really excited me, like, maybe I want to do that. They put themselves on the line to help others.”She proceeded to keep her grades up and took part in volleyball and track, enrolling in Prairie View A&M University in Texas. After she completed an intensive four-week Cadet Initial Entry Training program this summer, she was able to begin the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.The 20-year-old is the first in her family to attend college and her younger brother, Javell, is the second.The cadet’s new school year -- “the most important” of her time at Prairie View -- began this past Monday. Each day begins at 5:30 a.m. with physical training and classes continuing until 1 or 2 p.m. -- or 6 p.m. on Thursday, her long day. Blanche is concentrating on classes in her major of criminal justice this year and she’ll be dealing with college algebra, the last of her basic classes, next semester. It's that busy schedule, and her aspirations for a bright future, that helps keep her mind off the experience of having her family uprooted a decade ago.“Every year around this time it brings back memories,” Blanche told The Huffington Post. “I always think about when I went back home and was just seeing that my house wasn’t livable. It’s tragic to realize that you have to start all over and you don’t have anything. All your clothes are mildewy and everything in your house is damaged. It’s very emotional just to think about starting from scratch.”When asked if she missed living in her hometown of New Orleans, which she had never stepped foot outside of prior to the storm, she hesitates. Her mother, who is now in recovery from addiction, has moved back home and she visits regularly, but she's thankful for her new life in Texas. “My brother and I talk about this same thing, what would have happened if we were still out there, and I don’t think it would have been a great idea,” Blanche said. “I really feel like I wouldn’t have been in college because of everything around me. I would have gone down a wrong path. This relocation has been for the best.” Ten years later, Blanche is looking ahead. According to a profile on the Cadet Initial Entry Training program website, she hopes to one day work as a military police officer or in field artillery. “I want to get further in life and never go backwards,” Blanche added. “My biggest fear is to be in the same predicament I was before, not having money or not being able to provide. I want this to help me get a great job so that I can be stable for the rest of my life and to have a great career.”Also on HuffPost:"
