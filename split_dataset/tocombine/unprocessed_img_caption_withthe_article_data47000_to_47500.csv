When power is pursued for the right reasons, it can be a tremendous force for good.Niccolo Machiavelli spread the belief that people can only become powerful by exploiting the worst aspects of human nature. One of this teachings was, ""A wise ruler ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against his interests."" Machiavelli was essentially saying that you're an idiot if you keep your promises or stick to your values when you'd benefit more by breaking them.Not only did we hear it from Machiavelli, but also from plenty of voices in our own time, such as Robert Greene, who said, ""The key to power is the ability to judge who is best able to further your interests in all situations."" It's no wonder so many people think that the only way to get power is to be a jerk.Fortunately, Machiavelli and Greene had something in common: They were both wrong. Recent research from UC Berkeley shows that when it comes to power, nice guys finish first. The researchers found that the most powerful people (according to ratings from their peers) were those who were the most considerate and outgoing. They also found that those who were the most Machiavellian -- using things like gossip and manipulation to gain power -- were quickly identified and isolated and ended up with no power at all.Studies like these are rehabilitating power's bad rap. Power isn't inherently evil, and it isn't inherently bad to seek power. Without power, you can't accomplish anything, good or evil. Even those who want nothing more than to make the world a better place, can't do so without exerting the influence of personal power. It's the abuse of power and the underhanded things people do to achieve it that cause problems.People who earn and use power wisely have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. Yet, they achieve this power only because they exert so much influence inside, on themselves. We see only their outside; we see them innovate, speak their mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things. Yet, we're missing the best part. The confidence and wherewithal that make their influence possible are earned.And while what people are influenced by changes with the season, the unique habits of powerful people remain constant. Their focused pursuit of excellence is driven by eleven habits, which you can emulate and absorb until your power and influence expand:  1. They don't wait for a title to lead. It's important not to confuse power with authority. The right title can give you authority, but it can't give you power. On the other hand, you don't need a title to be powerful. You can lead without being a boss and you can have a powerful influence upon your workplace and community without a title.2. They're graciously disruptive. Powerful people are never satisfied with the status quo. They're the ones who constantly ask, ""What if?"" and ""Why not?"" They're not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, and they don't disrupt things for the sake of being disruptive; they do so to make things better.3. They think for themselves. Powerful people aren't buffeted by the latest trend or by public opinion. They form their opinions carefully, based on the facts. They're more than willing to change their mind when the facts support it, but they aren't influenced by what other people think, only by what they know.4. They focus only on what really matters. Powerful people aren't distracted by trivialities. They're able to cut through the static and clutter, focus on what matters, and point it out to everyone else. They speak only when they have something important to say, and they never bore people with idle banter.5. They master conflict. People tend to err on one of two extremes when it comes to conflict: some are passive and avoid conflict altogether, while others seek out conflict aggressively, thinking that this will make them powerful. People who master conflict know how to approach it directly and assertively, yet constructively. In essence, they practice emotional intelligence. Truly powerful people do not react emotionally and defensively to dissenting opinions -- they welcome them. They're humble enough to know that they don't know everything and that someone else might see something they missed. And if that person is right, they embrace the idea wholeheartedly, because they care more about the end result than being right.6. They inspire conversation. When powerful people speak, their words spread like ripples in a pond. Influencers inspire everyone around them to explore new ideas and to think differently about their work.7. They know their strengths and weaknesses. People who get seduced by power and, therefore, start abusing it are often blind to their own weaknesses. To become truly powerful, you have to see yourself as you really are and to position yourself to use your strengths for the greater good. That means taking a clear-eyed look at your strengths and your weaknesses and owning them both completely.  8. They grow and leverage their networks. Those who grow power the Machiavellian way don't bother with people who aren't useful to them. People see this coming a mile away, and it doesn't win any friends. Truly powerful people know how to make lasting connections. Not only do they know a lot of people, they get to know their connections' connections. More importantly, they add value to everyone in their network. They share advice and know how, and they make connections between people who should get to know each other.9. They ask for help when they need it. It's easy to mistakenly assume that powerful people never ask for help from anybody. Asking for help when you don't know the answer or can't do it all by yourself is not a sign of weakness; it's a sign of strength. It sends the message that you're not so insecure as to put your ego above the mission. It takes a tremendous amount of confidence and humility to admit that you need assistance, and asking for assistance is critical, because there's nothing worse than trucking down the wrong path when you're too embarrassed or proud to admit that you don't know what you're doing.10. They believe. Powerful people always expect the best. They believe in their own power to achieve their dreams, and they believe that others share that same power. They believe that nothing is out of reach and that belief inspires those around them to stretch for their own goals. They firmly believe that one person can change the world.11. They do it now. Way back in 1894, Orison Swett Marden made an important point: ""Don't wait for extraordinary opportunities. Seek common occasions and make them great. Weak men wait for opportunities. Strong men make them."" If you put off growing your power until the right opportunity comes along, it's never going to happen. Powerful people know that developing power is a lot like lifting weights or running a 5K. The only way to strengthen those muscles is by using them, so stop making excuses and just start. You know what you believe in, you know who you are, and you know what you want to become, so act like it. Yes, it will be uncomfortable at times, and yes, some people will tell you you're doing it wrong, but the only way to achieve power and use it for good is to get out there and do it.Bringing It All TogetherBoris Yeltsin once said, ""You can make a throne of bayonets, but you can't sit on it for very long."" Forget everything you've heard about power, because, in the end, the nice guys really do win. Whether you call it power or influence, it's okay to want it and it's okay to have it. You just have to pursue it and use it with integrity.Have you seen people abuse power? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

How can 40 be the new 30, and 50 be the new 40? Somehow we think the mathematicians are all mixed up. And even better... are they crazy? 60 is the new ... oh forget it. Hopefully, you are lighthearted and open-minded to take a look in the mirror and laugh a little. Because after all, a sense of humor goes a long, long way!We'd like to believe that age is really nothing but a number, but our social media and such really create a world where embracing age and promoting the beauty of aging is a nearly impossible feat. Daily reminders flash before us in every corner of life to let us know, those over 50, are kind of the forgotten tribe. To be honest, sometimes it's down right depressing to boot. How often do you see a 60, 70 or 80-year-old woman gracing the cover of anything? Truly just a handful of times. And just as we (hopefully) take time to enjoy this journey of our life, we begin to ponder: where do all those little gray whiskers and hairs come from? Do you have a clue??? Where were they living before? Suffice to say, we never invited them into our personal space -- do you know anyone who did? 'Be gone' is our command, and with that, we sprint to pick up the tweezers or run really fast to the salon. Maybe this contributes to the reason why we haven't become the next cover girls. Ah, at least someone should have been honest and told us why! All kidding aside, age is totally irrelevant as to what we can accomplish, learn or embrace. We are proud of where we are and how old we are. Aging is an opportunity, not a door shut. Our lives in the vertical state should welcome all the pleasures, challenges, epiphanies, and daily chances, in order to live, love and experience life. Your life is a story -- share it, and touch others with your presence. Simple advice for living? Get rid of anyone who uses the words: can't, never, or won't -- and reach for those in your circle who will talk about: potentials, thrills, life's fullness and positive expressions that are stimulating. While Nike coined the phrase ""Just do it,"" we say, ""Grab it."" Take the reins of life and gallop forward. Just be sure you always pack your tweezers.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
4,TRAVEL,Beyond Copenhagen - Denmark's Historic Cities: Demented in Denmark on the Looney Front - Part 3,"Mike Arkus, ContributorJournalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beyond-copenhagen---denma_b_11076432.html,,2016-09-04,2016-07-19-1468965986-6057038-Norwayplus20163086.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-19-1468965986-6057038-Norwayplus20163086-thumb.JPG,"Think of Denmark, and you immediately think of 'Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen,' Hans Christian Andersen and the Little Mermaid statue - the 'friendly old girl of a town... salty old queen of the sea' celebrated in song by Danny Kaye in the 1952 eponymous film about the great story teller.As Denmark's capital since 1416 Copenhagen is indeed wonderful with its green copper spires and gables, its royal palaces and government buildings, its scenic canals and parks, its world-famed Tivoli Gardens funfair, and much, much more.But there are other wonderful, wonderful cities beyond Copenhagen, too. RoskildeWonderful, wonderful Roskilde, just 20 miles to the west, capital before the move to Copenhagen, has much to offer beyond the five millennium-old Viking ships recovered from its fjord.   The massive cathedral, final resting place of Danish monarchs, may not possess the lacey stone grace and fancy filigrees of say, Chartres, but its red brick bulk and three tall spires are remarkably impressive, gaunt atop its green hill. Its oldest parts date from 1170, although the first church on the site was built in 985. Its lofty interior is taken up by the tombs of 38 kings and one queen, Margrethe I, whose sarcophagus holds pride of place behind the high altar. Grandiose chapels leading off from the nave hold the remains of nearly every king and his queen, except for a couple of early monarchs and current Queen Margrethe II's father Frederick IX, who had been a sailor much of his life and wanted to be buried in the open, where he lies with his wife, Queen Ingrid, in an open-roofed octagon, just outside the main door. High on an inside wall is a clock dating from the 1400s. Above it are St. George and the Dragon, and each hour the saint raises his sword and the dragon let's out an agonised wail, produced by air being pumped into three out-of-tune organ pipes. It's not much of a show, nothing like Liberty's Department store in London where St. George and the Dragon chase each other round frenziedly like blue arsed flies. I shall be avoiding another claim to fame, the annual Roskilde Festival held in late June and early July, Denmark's Woodstock or Glastonbury, the largest musical festival of its kind in northern Europe - a week-long lollapalooza beginning with a nude race around the campsite on the Saturday, with free tickets for the winners. Over 150,000 revellers are expected in town, countless numbers will be getting sloshed out of their minds, the Red Hot Chili Pepper, New Order and Wiz Khalifa will be belting out their numbers and more than 180 other bands will perform. Previous years have welcomed the likes of Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, the Sha Na Na, Aerosmith, Nirvana, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, and Megadeath. And talking about death, in 2000 nine people were killed and 26 injured in a stampede.Anyway, not that I'm agoraphobic, but I loathe, detest and abominate the agora.OdenseWonderful, wonderful Odense, Denmark's third largest city, on the island of Funen west of Roskilde, affords you the opportunity of passing through the delightfully named town of Middelfart, whose denizens, I assume, must be Middelfarters.Beyond being Hans Christian Andersen's home town and its proximity to Ladby, site of the Viking ship tomb, the thousand-year-old town has delightful old quarters of narrow cobble-stoned lanes and pastel-shaded cottages. The tall narrow steeple of its 14th century cathedral, Sankt Knuds, final resting place of King Canute IV, dominates the town-hall and the rather out-of-place statue of an obese reclining nude lady. One place I won't be visiting is Odense's famed zoo, which last year killed a perfectly healthy lion because it had too many, then publicly dissected it for schoolkids. But I do visit Egeskov castle, a 25-minute train ride and couple of miles walk south of Odense. Built in 1554 on a little lake, it's considered Europe's best preserved renaissance water castle and contains a huge banqueting hall, walls covered in the trophy heads of hunted wildlife.If you're into the mechanics of defecation and kindred studies, a great collection of chamber pots, lovely floral bidets, and a mobile wooden commode awaits you. AarhusWonderful, wonderful Aarhus on the Jutland peninsula, Denmark's second city, is dubbed by Lonely Planet 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride, [that] stands in the shadow of its bigger, brasher sibling.'But it's a lovely university town in its own right, with a magnificent cobbled Latin Quarter, quaint centuries-old mansions in various colours, a large brick cathedral with lofty green spires dating from the 12th century, and the equally old Vor Frue Kirk (Church of Our Lady).A model ship hangs from the cathedral's ceiling, as in many Danish churches, in memory of those lost at sea. Dated 1720, this one is apparently a model sent to Russia's Peter the Great by Dutch shipbuilders in connection with an upcoming order. The transport carrying it sank in a storm off Denmark but the model reached shore almost intact, where fishermen found it. Denmark's very own Boaty McBoatface.Lively restaurants and bars line the canalised Aarhus River running in from the port AalborgWonderful, wonderful Aalborg, a university town further north on the banks of Linholmfjord, also possesses the centuries-old buildings with steep triangular arched roofs that so enhance Nordic towns. There's a cathedral, originally from the 12th century, with a tall ornate steeple, the large five-story Stone House built by a rich merchant in 1624, and a castle fortress.For a change of time and pace, it's also home to the Utzon Centre, the last work designed by Jørn Utzon, architect of the iconic Sydney Opera House with its parabolic shells or flying sails. Well, this effort is distinctly inferior, more like a collection of distorted steel shoe boxes. There's also Synagogue Street, but no synagogue. The Germans blew up the century-old building in 1945. By then the Danes had spirited their Jewish community to neutral Sweden. At the many terrace cafes in the squares near the cathedral large seagulls are effecting daredevil dives as they steal French fries from an unattended table, strafing nearby eaters within a hair's breadth of contact. Or you can sup in more sedate surroundings - the cellar restaurant in the Old Stone House.   The quaint cobbled streets are full of fairs and several buildings have giant murals from the figurative, realist and many other schools mustered in a municipal street art project.The students ensure that Jomfru Ane Gade and a couple of other streets are both lively and drunken; wall-to-wall bars, 100-krone ($15) beer walks, and port calls at six participating dens fuel much jolly elbow hoisting. RibeWonderful, wonderful Ribe, billed as Denmark's oldest town, was founded in the early 8th century in the fens near the North Sea coast of Jutland.It celebrated its 1,300 anniversary in 2010, and is wonderfully evocative, with winding cobbled lanes bordered by 400-year-old red-roofed houses painted in yellows, reds and whites, some with outer wooden beams, all dominated by another massive brick and stone cathedral, the oldest in Denmark.Built around 948, it was rebuilt after a fire in 1150 with many later additions, resulting in a hulking brick confection of eclectic design that is anything but in harmony with itself. At the entrance door, the north-east tower has a so-called Rhenish helmet of angular facets with a narrow spire. A similar north-west tower collapsed and was replaced with a bulky square monolith 170-feet high with a flat top.A spindly green spire tops the green roof over the rounded apse at the other end and several adjunct chapels project out from the walls. Within, it is light, adorned with a series of Moorish-style windows. The apse was redecorated, controversially, with modern almost Chagall-like frescoes and paintings 30 years ago. Whatever, the whole is still a very impressive sight.What's more you can climb the 248 steps, 63 spiraling stone, then 185 steep wooden stairs, to the top of the brick tower for superb views, passing by the large bell from 1436. With my naturally expert timing I pass by on the way down at the exact half hour. My ears are still ringing. Lucky it wasn't the carillon playing 'Queen Dagmar is ill in Ribe,' as it does at noon and 3 p.m.Outside, newly graduated high school seniors in white sailor captain hats are marching through the town square behind a fire truck playing 'Yes sir, that's my baby/No sir, I don't mean maybe/ Yes sir, that's my baby now.'[Upcoming blog next Sunday: Aarhus - a tale of two museums]______________ By the same author: Bussing The Amazon: On The Road With The Accidental Journalist, available with free excerpts on Kindle and in print version on Amazon.

I shall be avoiding another claim to fame, the annual Roskilde Festival held in late June and early July, Denmark's Woodstock or Glastonbury, the largest musical festival of its kind in northern Europe - a week-long lollapalooza beginning with a nude race around the campsite on the Saturday, with free tickets for the winners. Over 150,000 revellers are expected in town, countless numbers will be getting sloshed out of their minds, the Red Hot Chili Pepper, New Order and Wiz Khalifa will be belting out their numbers and more than 180 other bands will perform. Previous years have welcomed the likes of Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, the Sha Na Na, Aerosmith, Nirvana, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, and Megadeath. And talking about death, in 2000 nine people were killed and 26 injured in a stampede.Anyway, not that I'm agoraphobic, but I loathe, detest and abominate the agora.OdenseWonderful, wonderful Odense, Denmark's third largest city, on the island of Funen west of Roskilde, affords you the opportunity of passing through the delightfully named town of Middelfart, whose denizens, I assume, must be Middelfarters.Beyond being Hans Christian Andersen's home town and its proximity to Ladby, site of the Viking ship tomb, the thousand-year-old town has delightful old quarters of narrow cobble-stoned lanes and pastel-shaded cottages. The tall narrow steeple of its 14th century cathedral, Sankt Knuds, final resting place of King Canute IV, dominates the town-hall and the rather out-of-place statue of an obese reclining nude lady. One place I won't be visiting is Odense's famed zoo, which last year killed a perfectly healthy lion because it had too many, then publicly dissected it for schoolkids. But I do visit Egeskov castle, a 25-minute train ride and couple of miles walk south of Odense. Built in 1554 on a little lake, it's considered Europe's best preserved renaissance water castle and contains a huge banqueting hall, walls covered in the trophy heads of hunted wildlife.If you're into the mechanics of defecation and kindred studies, a great collection of chamber pots, lovely floral bidets, and a mobile wooden commode awaits you. AarhusWonderful, wonderful Aarhus on the Jutland peninsula, Denmark's second city, is dubbed by Lonely Planet 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride, [that] stands in the shadow of its bigger, brasher sibling.'But it's a lovely university town in its own right, with a magnificent cobbled Latin Quarter, quaint centuries-old mansions in various colours, a large brick cathedral with lofty green spires dating from the 12th century, and the equally old Vor Frue Kirk (Church of Our Lady).A model ship hangs from the cathedral's ceiling, as in many Danish churches, in memory of those lost at sea. Dated 1720, this one is apparently a model sent to Russia's Peter the Great by Dutch shipbuilders in connection with an upcoming order. The transport carrying it sank in a storm off Denmark but the model reached shore almost intact, where fishermen found it. Denmark's very own Boaty McBoatface.Lively restaurants and bars line the canalised Aarhus River running in from the port AalborgWonderful, wonderful Aalborg, a university town further north on the banks of Linholmfjord, also possesses the centuries-old buildings with steep triangular arched roofs that so enhance Nordic towns. There's a cathedral, originally from the 12th century, with a tall ornate steeple, the large five-story Stone House built by a rich merchant in 1624, and a castle fortress.For a change of time and pace, it's also home to the Utzon Centre, the last work designed by Jørn Utzon, architect of the iconic Sydney Opera House with its parabolic shells or flying sails. Well, this effort is distinctly inferior, more like a collection of distorted steel shoe boxes. There's also Synagogue Street, but no synagogue. The Germans blew up the century-old building in 1945. By then the Danes had spirited their Jewish community to neutral Sweden. At the many terrace cafes in the squares near the cathedral large seagulls are effecting daredevil dives as they steal French fries from an unattended table, strafing nearby eaters within a hair's breadth of contact. Or you can sup in more sedate surroundings - the cellar restaurant in the Old Stone House.   The quaint cobbled streets are full of fairs and several buildings have giant murals from the figurative, realist and many other schools mustered in a municipal street art project.The students ensure that Jomfru Ane Gade and a couple of other streets are both lively and drunken; wall-to-wall bars, 100-krone ($15) beer walks, and port calls at six participating dens fuel much jolly elbow hoisting. RibeWonderful, wonderful Ribe, billed as Denmark's oldest town, was founded in the early 8th century in the fens near the North Sea coast of Jutland.It celebrated its 1,300 anniversary in 2010, and is wonderfully evocative, with winding cobbled lanes bordered by 400-year-old red-roofed houses painted in yellows, reds and whites, some with outer wooden beams, all dominated by another massive brick and stone cathedral, the oldest in Denmark.Built around 948, it was rebuilt after a fire in 1150 with many later additions, resulting in a hulking brick confection of eclectic design that is anything but in harmony with itself. At the entrance door, the north-east tower has a so-called Rhenish helmet of angular facets with a narrow spire. A similar north-west tower collapsed and was replaced with a bulky square monolith 170-feet high with a flat top.A spindly green spire tops the green roof over the rounded apse at the other end and several adjunct chapels project out from the walls. Within, it is light, adorned with a series of Moorish-style windows. The apse was redecorated, controversially, with modern almost Chagall-like frescoes and paintings 30 years ago. Whatever, the whole is still a very impressive sight.What's more you can climb the 248 steps, 63 spiraling stone, then 185 steep wooden stairs, to the top of the brick tower for superb views, passing by the large bell from 1436. With my naturally expert timing I pass by on the way down at the exact half hour. My ears are still ringing. Lucky it wasn't the carillon playing 'Queen Dagmar is ill in Ribe,' as it does at noon and 3 p.m.Outside, newly graduated high school seniors in white sailor captain hats are marching through the town square behind a fire truck playing 'Yes sir, that's my baby/No sir, I don't mean maybe/ Yes sir, that's my baby now.'[Upcoming blog next Sunday: Aarhus - a tale of two museums]______________ By the same author: Bussing The Amazon: On The Road With The Accidental Journalist, available with free excerpts on Kindle and in print version on Amazon.

RoskildeWonderful, wonderful Roskilde, just 20 miles to the west, capital before the move to Copenhagen, has much to offer beyond the five millennium-old Viking ships recovered from its fjord.   The massive cathedral, final resting place of Danish monarchs, may not possess the lacey stone grace and fancy filigrees of say, Chartres, but its red brick bulk and three tall spires are remarkably impressive, gaunt atop its green hill. Its oldest parts date from 1170, although the first church on the site was built in 985. Its lofty interior is taken up by the tombs of 38 kings and one queen, Margrethe I, whose sarcophagus holds pride of place behind the high altar. Grandiose chapels leading off from the nave hold the remains of nearly every king and his queen, except for a couple of early monarchs and current Queen Margrethe II's father Frederick IX, who had been a sailor much of his life and wanted to be buried in the open, where he lies with his wife, Queen Ingrid, in an open-roofed octagon, just outside the main door. High on an inside wall is a clock dating from the 1400s. Above it are St. George and the Dragon, and each hour the saint raises his sword and the dragon let's out an agonised wail, produced by air being pumped into three out-of-tune organ pipes. It's not much of a show, nothing like Liberty's Department store in London where St. George and the Dragon chase each other round frenziedly like blue arsed flies.

It is well past time that American workers receive their fair share of that wealth. Americans work extremely long hours and are incredibly productive. Yet, for the last three and a half decades, they have not received the just fruits of their labor. From 1948 to 1979, two-thirds of aggregate income growth in the United States went to the bottom 90 percent. But from 1979 onward, nearly two-thirds of growth went to the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, the aggregate income of the bottom 90 percent actually declined! We are the wealthiest country in the world at the wealthiest moment in our history. Shamefully, we have tens of millions of people living in poverty. The middle class is being squeezed out, caught between those with unprecedented wealth and those who suffer food insecurity, who go to bed hungry.This rising and perilous income and wealth inequality did not happen by accident. It is the foreseeable consequence of a persistent upward redistribution of wealth, resulting from decades of public policies that favor corporations and the wealthiest Americans over everyone else. These public policies constitute a war on workers. Attacks on unions, privatization of public functions, huge tax breaks for those at the top, deep cuts to domestic spending, weakening of regulations protecting workers, an eroding minimum wage, and attacks on our Social Security system are all part of the war. Predictably, they have resulted in stagnating wages and longer hours for everyday workers, and the income and wealth inequality we see all around us.Fortunately, workers can help themselves this November 8. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have concrete plans to reverse these destructive policies, stop the upward redistribution of wealth, and make sure that workers receive their fair share. In sharp contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party have concrete plans to double down on the war on workers.It is long past time that workers receive a substantial raise. Total compensation packages should be increased. That means take-home pay should be larger. So should deferred compensation, in the form of larger Social Security checks at retirement. So should Social Security's life insurance and disability insurance benefits, earned with every pay check. And, Social Security's protections should be expanded to include other vital protections, including paid sick leave and paid family leave. Workers' ability to fight for higher compensation should be strengthened. So should regulations protecting workers' health and safety.Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party advocate a substantial, long-overdue increase in the federal minimum wage, while Donald Trump and the Republican Party are fine with a starvation federal minimum wage. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party want to protect and strengthen workers' ability to bargain with their employers, while Donald Trump and the Republican Party propose to intensify their war on collective bargaining. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party want to improve worker health and safety, while Donald Trump and the Republican Party want to further weaken these protections. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party favor paid family leave, paid sick days, and paid vacation. Donald Trump and the Republican Party apparently do not think these benefits, available to workers around the world, are worth even mentioning. The stance of the two parties and their presidential standard bearers are well exemplified by their divergent Social Security positions.  In their new book, Stronger Together, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine identify and repudiate the ""years of mythmaking, claiming we cannot afford Social Security and that the only solution is to cut the benefits on which 90 percent of American seniors rely."" In sharp contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party are aggressively promoting the myth. The Republican Platform, in fear-mongering fashion, labels its Social Security plank, ""Saving Social Security, ""(emphasis added), and claims that Social Security's ""current course will lead to a financial and social disaster."" Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine, and the Democratic Party advocate expanding Social Security's modest but vital benefits. They recognize that an expanded Social Security is a solution to many challenges facing the nation, including a looming retirement income crisis and our immoral, destabilizing income and wealth inequality.In contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party want to cut and privatize -- that is, dismantle -- our Social Security system. While Donald Trump promised during the primaries that he wouldn't cut Social Security, this is clearly a lie. Immediately after he clinched the nomination, his top policy adviser told a closed door meeting, that Trump would indeed be open to cuts, the Trump campaign is filled with policy advisors who support cuts, the Republican Platform advocates cuts and privatization, and Trump's past statements, prior to running, advocate cutting and privatizing the program he slanderously labeled a ""Ponzi scheme."" He apparently understands the politics though, having warned Republicans in 2011 that openly advocating cuts to Social Security would cost them at the ballot box. Clinton's book title and her campaign rallying cry, Stronger Together, could be used to describe Social Security. Stronger Together describes perfectly Social Security's conceptual underpinning. Social Security recognizes that all of us face common economic risks. Rich or poor, any of us can die prematurely, leaving young children behind. Rich or poor, any of us can suffer a devastating, disabling accident or illness. Rich or poor, all of us hope to grow old. When we do, we need, for a dignified and independent retirement, a guaranteed steady income which we cannot and will not outlive. Social Security recognizes that the best way to protect ourselves and our families against the economic consequences of those risks is to join together and pool them, sharing both our risks and our responsibilities. Stronger together.Under the powerful watchword, Stronger Together, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party advocate raising the income and improving the economic security of every one of us, while eliminating gender and racial income and wealth inequalities. In stark contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party scapegoat, seeking to turn us against each other - against immigrants, against Mexican-Americans, against Muslim-Americans. Keep us divided, so we are too weak and distracted to fight together for what we have earned. The Republican divide-and-conquer strategy is nothing new. President Franklin Roosevelt recognized and confronted it, when, a few days before the 1936 presidential election, in a speech defending Social Security against vicious and misleading attacks, he proclaimed, ""It is an old strategy of tyrants to delude their victims into fighting their battles for them.""That strategy is alive and well in the person of Donald Trump. In the election of 1936, Americans understood who was with them and who was not. After their electoral victory, Roosevelt and Democrats in Congress successfully fought for laws providing a federal minimum wage, maximum hours, and protection of collective bargaining. They succeeded in increasing Social Security's benefits and expanding its protections to the families of workers. Like workers in 1936, today's workers should see that the Democratic Party and its presidential standard bearer are with them, while the Republican Party and its presidential standard bearer are against them. If today's workers, like those in 1936, recognize the truth and vote accordingly, the Democrats will win on November 8. Armed with that victory, Clinton and her Democratic allies can fight to increase the minimum wage, expand Social Security, and improve worker security, rights, and wellbeing in numerous other ways. That will be something to celebrate for many Labor Days to come."

Mironov denied that.America sought his arrest because Synesis has a U.S. presence -- in North Carolina.The United States has declined to specify the country that bought the technology. Presumably it was a U.S. enemy.American officials also want to charge Mironov with money laundering. This suggests they think he used illegal means to hide proceeds from the tech sale.The amount the United States accuses Mironov of laundering is a pittance as these cases go: $50,000. The money laundering cases that Western prosecutors usually pursue range from millions of dollars to the hundreds of millions.Synesis is one of a couple of dozen companies around the world that has developed video-analytics technology.The systems alert clients who use video surveillance to patterns on the video indicating the presence of an intruder. Until the technology came along, humans would have to monitor video surveillance 24/7 for signs of intruders.Those who have developed the technology say its spots patterns -- such as changes in shadows that indicate an intruder -- better than humans do.The potential market for the technology is enormous, starting with governments and companies. Militaries, in particular, are salivating over it because it will give them a greater ability to spot, and ward off, sneak attacks. Here's the dilemma that Armenia faced when Mironov and his wife Yuliya flew in to Armenia's capital, Yerevan, for a vacation:The United States, which has given Armenia a lot of foreign aid, demanded that the Russian be handed over.Russia, which has a huge economic and military presence in Armenia, said no way.Russia snarls every time the United States arrests Russian citizens in other countries for crimes against America. And it refuses to extradite any of its citizens, no matter how heinous the overseas crimes they are accused of committing.An example of the snarling occurred when Thailand arrested the Merchant of Death, Russia's notorious international arms dealer Viktor Bout. The Thais turned him over to the United States, where he was convicted of breaking a number of American laws and is now serving a long prison sentence.It's one thing for a country that is not a Russian ally to turn over a Russian citizen to the United States, however -- and quite another for a virtual Russian colony like Armenia to do so.So Armenia engaged in a tap dance, arresting Mironov as the Americans requested, but letting a member of its judiciary -- which is supposed to be independent -- decide whether to hand him over to the FBI for good.It was no surprise when the judge let Mironov go three days into his detention. Armenian judges have a history of doing what the country's officials expect.Even though the Mironov's release was the outcome that Moscow wanted, Russian big shots growled about Armenia's decision to arrest him in the first place.""Friendly countries don't do such things,"" the Russian news agency Vestnik Kavkaza quoted political analyst Andrei Yepifantsev as saying.News of the detention outraged Russians, he said -- and that blowback led to Armenia realizing it had gone too far.A Russian defense official charged that the United States had demanded Mironov's handover with the deliberate intent of driving a wedge between Armenia and Russia.The case was also ""about the U.S. attempt to have the whole world bow down to its jurisdiction,"" said the official, Franz Klintsevich, the first deputy chairman of Russia's Council on Defense and Security.Meanwhile, Mironov played dumb, saying he had no idea why he had been arrested.He noted that he had had no access to military technology and that he had been to the United States only once -- in 2013.His contention that he had no access to military technology was disingenuous. It's obvious that video-analytics technology has important military as well as civilian applications.Although Mironov was never in danger of having Armenia extradite him to the United States, it's a good bet that he's already decided to take his vacations in the former Soviet Union from now on.If he ventures into a country outside the Commonwealth of Independent States, he may find himself on a free flight to Washington with FBI agents as his conversation mates.Armine Sahakyan is a human rights activist based in Armenia. A columnist with the Kyiv Post and a blogger with The Huffington Post, she writes on human rights and democracy in Russia and the former Soviet Union."

Sunglasses, check. Bespoke menswear, check. He's even got a song named after him, by Jay-Z. And film? Wow, yes, yes, oh yes. Nobody does haunting images on the big screen quite like Tom Ford.In his latest oeuvre, well his second after a seven year hiatus from filmmaking, Ford puts together another stellar cast -- which includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams and Michael Shannon -- and then mixes up the batch by throwing in a story within the story, a book that fills up the pages of the movie script. It's brilliant, of course we all knew that before going into the Venice Film Festival, where Nocturnal Animals world premiered. As proof of its magnificence, it was impossible to get a hold of any publicists for the movie and the press conference seemed more like a Justin Bieber public appearance than a film delegation meeting the press. Lets face it, even if he's yet to make his first record, Tom Ford is a rockstar.Nocturnal Animals does not disappoint, in any way, shape or form. From the first frame to the last it's haunting and can't-turn-your-eyes-away captivating. I'll admit, the first shots of the voluptuous burlesque women inspired by Fellini made me wonder, and I wrote it down, if Ford's genius had gotten so big for his shoes that people around him were too scared to say something was a bit heavy handed. But once the intent of those images, beautiful and grotesque at once, was known, I quickly crossed out that sentence from my notebook. The story within the story has to do with a book Jake Gyllenhaal's character Edward has written. Edward is Susan's ex, a chronic insomniac played by Amy Adams. In his novel, he tells the tale of a family, Tony (again Gyllenhaal), his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their daughter India (Ellie Bamber), who are harassed and attacked on a desolate Texas road, by three rednecks -- including the chilling Aaron Taylor-Johnson -- one dark night. The outcome requires another phenomenal character, detective Bobby Andes, played by personal favorite Michael Shannon, to come in and help bring the story home. Ford comfortably weaves three threads into Nocturnal Animals, the past of Susan and Edward, her present with new husband Armie Hammer, and the story of Tony and his family, with Andes. The result is spellbinding. At the press conference, Ford confessed that what captured him in the book his film is based on, the 1993 novel Tony & Susan by Austin Wright, is ""loyalty -- that's very important to me. When you find those people in your life, you hold on to them. [It's a] cautionary tale of what can happen when you let go of people.""Gyllenhaal instead confessed that what drew him to the script was ""the color of paper the script was printed on, a particular hue of red I'd never seen."" But of course, once opened, the pretty packaging held ""one of the best scripts I'd ever read. Gripping and emotional and somehow went into a space where the metaphor of heartbreak stepped into real life.""For Adams, the pull was this ""very personal story... I wanted to be a part of telling this story of loss and regret."" But she admitted that, ""when I first started preparing Susan, I didn't like her. And I can't play a character I don't like so I had to find my way into her."" This is where the true talent of Ford's directing came in, she confessed ""Tom's skilled hand was so patient. I really credit Tom for trusting that the stillness and the silence would be filled with the story."" As Ford added, about regrets, those we all have once we stop being 20 and 30, he shared that someone once said to him, ""midlife is when you get to the top of the ladder and find out all along you've had it on the wrong wall."" And he also disclosed his secret for picking stories that stay in our heart, long after his haunting images are gone, ""I think I may be old fashioned but I believe there needs to be a moral to a story. If you leave a theater and it doesn't stay with you, it doesn't haunt you, it's not worth it."" Nocturnal Animals releases in mid-November. Franca Sozzani, to those of us who love fashion, is a legend. Her signature long, blond, wavy hair I've seen from NYC to Florence, from Dubai to Saudi Arabia and now Venice. She's a journalist, and has been the Editor in Chief of Vogue Italia since the late 80s. But she's also a mother, and her son Francesco Carrozzini has made a tribute film to his mother, titled Franca: Chaos and Creation. While I've yet to watch the film, it was interesting to burst in on the press conference for the documentary, since Sozzani and Carrozzini have an explosive dynamic. Hidden beneath the surface of her beauty, and his talent, there are crosscurrents these two feel, quite obviously, about each other's work. As the daughter of a strong mother who claimed something similar to what Sozzani declared -- that ""in the moment I leave work the magazine could burn down!"" -- I know that's true, but to some extent. My mother was always the artist, and while I never lacked for anything, as I'm sure Carrozzini never did either, I felt mom's aloofness during her hard days of creation. But creative women are forever struggling with that, the idea that they have to be mothers and wives and then also powerful work machines. I see that struggle even in Sozzani beautifully put together persona. I yearned to hear her secret for that ever blissed-out look that always completes her outfits. ""I've never stopped dreaming,"" she admitted, and perhaps that's why film is so powerful. Because even when we have, stopped dreaming, or forget to, cinema reminds us to -- with a vision on the big screen. A technicolor dream. The Bleeder I knew I needed to watch in Venice because it stars Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts. Those two could read the phone book, and as long as they do, together, I would listen to them from A to Z. Their chemistry in this film, though Watts is only on screen for about 15 minutes tops, is so powerful that it left me wanting for more. The Bleeder is the story of real-life Rocky inspiration Chuck Wepner, the boxer most famous for having gone fifteen rounds with Mohammad Ali, before being defeated by Ali. Directed by Oscar nominated filmmaker Philippe Falardeau, The Bleeder is the kind of film that cannot be separated from its stars. I dare not think of it without Schreiber, who holds the audience's attention from the first shot to the last, and the real life chemistry that Watts brings to her role as Wepner's second wife and salvation, Linda. When I asked Schreiber if Wepner is somehow Shakespearean, he enthusiastically answered, ""he's absolutely Shakespearean! But you're talking to a guy who thinks everyone is Shakespearean."" Then, pushing him further, I asked him what makes him so, and Schreiber continued, ""the duality, the conflict, the human tragedy, also his vulnerability, his openness, his innocence, his naiveté; he doesn't hide his mistakes, he makes them beautifully out in the open, exquisitely clumsy. And that's Shakespearean."" The Bleeder screens next at the Toronto International Film Festival. Finally, Wim Wenders latest, The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez in 3D. Why 3D? Wenders was quick to point out, because ""3D is a very tender language and technology, it's a very kind technology, it corresponds to our two eyes if you use it naturally... I don't think I could have included you in any other way."" And include us in he does, into an delicately intimate conversation between a man and a woman, sitting at a table somewhere in the countryside outside Paris, while a man with a typewriter, sitting inside, seems to write their dialogue. Is this God? Are the couple Adam and Eve, since there is an apple on the table? Could be, but they are also every day men and women, struggling to find a way to communicate even though words and thoughts are exchanged between them.At first, I'll admit I felt slightly confused by The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez, but the more time passes after watching it, the stronger I appreciate Wenders genius to be. Apart from the great luxury of watching lavender on the big screen in full 3D wonder and the filmmaker's wonderful choice of music -- including a live performance by Nick Cave -- Wenders teaches us, his audience, a new way to breathe. He slows down our inner rhythm to match his art and it all somehow makes for an outer-worldly experience.And that's what cinema is all about, after all, finding new eyes to help us view the world. Even if those eyes turn out to be bulky 3D glasses!All images courtesy of La Biennale, used with permission. "

12,ENTERTAINMENT,"Liev Schreiber in Venice: Movie Star, 'The Bleeder' and Persol Visionary Talent of 2016","E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liev-schreiber-in-venice_b_11859308.html,,2016-09-04,2016-09-04-1473018931-7003015-AwardWinningCeremonyPersolAwardLievSchreiberAlbertoBarberalaBiennalediVeneziafotoASAC.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-04-1473018931-7003015-AwardWinningCeremonyPersolAwardLievSchreiberAlbertoBarberalaBiennalediVeneziafotoASAC-thumb.JPG," Laura Didoni for Persol, Liev Schreiber and Venice Film Festival Director Alberto BarberaJust what makes a movie star? While there are as many different answers as there are stars, journalists and audience members, to me a real rockstar of the big screen is someone with an oversupply of the ""C"" word: Charisma. Sitting at a roundtable with six other journalists, and by sheer luck right next to Liev Schreiber at a junket for Philippe Falardeau's The Bleeder, it was clear that Schreiber held us captive with his palpable magnetism. While I hardly could pull my gaze away from his strong face, his engrossing tone of voice and the brightest blue eyes this side of the Grand Canal, if I did manage to glance at my colleagues across the table, men and women alike were mesmerized. And all completely and utterly star struck. That is a real movie star. But perhaps the true wonder of someone like Schreiber is that he's not just a movie star -- which in itself would be enough -- he's also a filmmaker, a father, a TV star, a loving partner to co-star in life and film Naomi Watts, and a man. What we all felt at that table was the sort of respect that true men command, and it was exhilarating for those twenty-odd minutes.This year at the Venice Film Festival, Schreiber is promoting The Bleeder, the story of real Rocky inspiration Chuck Wepner, the boxer who went fifteen rounds with Mohammad Ali, only to then loose to the champ. Schreiber also accepted this year's Persol Tribute to Visionary Talent Award, a prestigious prize that has gone to the likes of Frances McDormand and Jonathan Demme in past years. And he's doing all of this, a grueling schedule in Italy before stepping off to Toronto to begin it all again, with class and grace. When I asked Laura Didoni, the Global Luxury Brands Director for Luxottica Group, why Persol had chosen Schreiber, she explained ""Liev Schreiber is a person who is really constantly reinventing himself,"" then continued ""La Biennale and Persol saw in Liev something very close to our brand. He's a very respected Shakespearean actor, so he has a theater heritage, something we have in common really going back to ancient arts. But still he's also made cinema, as an actor and director, very eclectic, and that's why there is a connection, we feel. We have a very unique heritage as well, while also trying to keep an expression that is very fresh. We experiment sometimes, but we never forget where we are coming from. There are a lot of similarities in our stories.""Persol itself has a heritage deeply rooted in Italian cinema and history, from its roots, which Didoni explained by saying that ""the brand was founded in 1917 and the first style was created to protect tram drivers in Turin, from the dust and the elements, because trams were open."" Then came the iconic Fellini, La Dolce Vita and Marcello Mastroianni's glasses, and of course Steve McQueen, whose love of the brand still holds a special place in cinematic history. So, considering the definition of elegance that Didoni gave me, ""effortless authenticity,"" then continuing ""we [at Persol] think you have something special, everyone has something special, you don't need to follow anyone else or anything else... That's elegance!"" I believe wholeheartedly that Schreiber was their perfect choice. And the perfect choice to play Wepner, a man whose courage and virtue, although maybe hiding just beneath the surface, were there all along, plentiful and sincere.What is it about boxing that every good actor in his career has to make a movie as a boxer?Liev Schreiber: I don't know what the connection between actors and boxing is, but I suspect it has something to do with fear. But it wasn't the boxing that interested me about this story, it was the kind of rabbit hole of narcissism that the character goes down I found compelling.Do you think that has a connection with acting?Schreiber: (laughs) Absolutely!Do you think Chuck Wepner is Shakespearean?Schreiber: He's absolutely Shakespearean! But you're talking to a guy who thinks everyone is Shakespearean. That's why I'm asking! What's Shakespearean about him?Schreiber: The duality, the conflict, the human tragedy, also his vulnerability, his openness, his innocence, his naiveté, he doesn't hide his mistakes, he makes them beautifully out in the open, exquisitely clumsy. And that's Shakespearean. What is your experience with fame, and how to handle it?Schreiber: If we believe the central lie that is at the core of fame, which is that we are the most interesting person in the room, the room quickly becomes empty, and it's a very lonely existence. I think we all struggle with the desire to be appreciated and adored and loved by many. I think actors do it publicly, athletes do it publicly, whereas most of us do it in private and therefore are able to manage it. Whereas when you have real returns from this kind of a feeling, life gets dangerous. I think having children certainly helped, because you realize you must be able to pay attention to them. I mean to try to teach your kids to look at the world with as much wonder as it looks at you is important and hard and I think Chuck's life is a beautiful analogy of that story and he learned it so well. You see him now with his family and he's a remarkable husband, a great dad and a really, really beautiful guy. But I think it's because he went through that battle. I certainly think his battle with his own demons was much much worse than fifteen rounds with Mohammad Ali.What did you learn about boxing?Schreiber: I've been boxing around fifteen years, not seriously, just as a way to keep fit and it's a sport I enjoy. I was a competitive fencer and it felt a lot like fencing initially. I never really boxed with anyone trying to hurt me... I mean I've had my nose broken a couple of times but it's not as bad as people think it is. I think that's the fascination with boxing. It doesn't hurt to get punched in the face as much as you think it does. There are few nerves and it's all psychological. It's the terror of being punched in the face that's so crippling. It's not the pain. I think initially I was so terrified of being punched in the face that my feet were frozen. And it's when you actually get punched in the face that you go, ""oh, that's not so bad"" and you loosen up and you're able to see it. The instinct to move towards danger rather than away from it... is very strange. It's something Chuck possesses in great quantity, he always moves forward, moves forward. And this is a man who's been punched by the likes of Sonny Liston, George Foreman and Mohammad Ali. Arguably the most powerful punchers in the history of boxing and he moves forward, forward, forward and that says everything about the man on many levels.You were talking about redemption before, Chuck's redemption, so how much do you think that redemption has to do with the woman that he ends up with?Schreiber: So much of it has to do with it. I think his redemption is looking for himself and he finds himself in loving another person. And maybe the answer to the riddle of narcissism, you know, we often find out who we are through giving something, through being generous and taking the attention off of ourselves. And I think the redemptive thing for him was to be loved by a one person rather than millions. Working with Ms. Watts, what was that like?Schreiber: (giggles, yes a grown man giggle) We can't do it very often because we have kids together so if one person's working the other takes care of them. But this is not a character that's particularly close to Naomi, as a person she's kind of a demure English girl, so it was really fun to see her walk out of the wardrobe trailer with the red wig and the fake boobs and the leopard print tights... Not many people know how funny she is so I was really enjoying it. Was she worried that you were getting so much into these fights?Schreiber: No, she enjoyed it, she loves seeing me get punched in the face. We were talking before about the danger of fame. When did you have your ten minutes of madness?Schreiber: I'm having it right now. As we speak. I started in the theater, a microcosm of it, it was very good training for an actor, because it's a microcosm of fame. If you go through that you come out the other side and go, eh uh, I want something with more continuity, what am I doing and what am I doing it for? Am I learning anything, am I giving anything, and that helps because then you get to the film business and it gets crazy! And then you get to TV and it gets even crazier. Is it crazier on TV?Schreiber: Suddenly you are in everyone's living room and there is an intimacy that people feel with you that until you experience that, you really don't know what fame is. To have millions and millions of people think they know you, and feel intimate with you, it's a very strange feeling. Talk to you on the street, and call you ""Ray"". It's very complicated when someone comes up to you and does that, part of you feels genuine gratitude because they spent that much time with you and they consider what you did worthy of their attention, so there is a real feeling of gratitude, and at the same time, a human instinct to share in the intimacy, but you don't have the intimacy because you don't know them. But they, because they've watched the show, have a level of intimacy with you that you're not aware of. And it's a very strange relationship.Why did you want to become an actor in the first place?Schreiber: Probably some tragic level of narcissism that I've come to terms with, but certainly in the beginning I really liked having people's attention. I still do. Well, it's a really good feeling. What you do with it is important. Nothing really compares with live theater. You know you repeat a play eight times a week, it will drive you fucking mad. What changes every night, the one thing that makes it survivable is the audience. A new character comes in every night and does the play with you. And you feel their attention, if you're doing your job right, they're connected, they are energized and they're enjoying it. They are following you and they are leading you and they are nudging you, and you feel by their laughter, by their lack of laughter, by their reactions, you feel connected.And you've got a team, you share something and you're going to hunt together and you're not alone. Probably many actors started someplace feeling very alone, for one reason or another, and want to change that. I think Chuck's an example of that. He's not an actor but somebody who really felt he had to make his impression on the world so much so that he was going to withstand being punched by the greatest fighter of all times for fifteen rounds. And not go down, by sheer will, because he had to let people know that he was one of them. And that's such an alienating tough position and it's a testament to the success of the Rocky franchise, because we all feel that. It's ironic that we all feel alienated but that's what Stallone tapped into. The Bleeder screens next at the Toronto International Film Festival.

(AP Photo/Wayne Parry)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb829051f00000002253ac3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As my late friend, zoology professor Mark Rowland, liked to say when addressing the emotional issue of pro-life vs. pro-choice: ""Some people see the uterus as half-empty, and others see it as half-full."" That mordant, binary sentiment could apply to the current state of organized labor. According to some observers, the once vaunted American labor movement is either already dead or is in the process of dying a hideous death. Granted, these pessimistic observers consist largely of sheltered academics, Chamber of Commerce officers, and Michigan Republicans. But other, more optimistic observers happily note that, with 14.8 million people belonging to unions (11-percent of the workforce), the U.S. labor movement is still a vital--if unfocussed and demoralized--force to be reckoned with. Do the math. If the National Rifle Association (NRA), with a membership of barely five million, can strike terror in the hearts of America's lawmakers, surely 14.8 million union workers have the ability to make some noise. Union people will tell you that there are two legislative moves required to level the playing field. The first is passage of the EFCA (Employee Free Choice Act), which would make ""card check"" the law of the land, effectively eliminating the bureaucratic morass and stalling tactics regularly used by management. While hypocritical businessmen pretend that, like the powdered wig set of the 18th century, they abhor Big Government, when it comes to workers being allowed to freely join a union, they beg the feds to intervene, beg them to step in and make joining a union as complicated a procedure as becoming a U.S. citizen. And this isn't an ideological or constitutional issue for these profit-takers; it's an economic one. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015), the average weekly wage for a union employee is $980, and the average weekly wage for a non-union worker is $776. Simple as that. The second thing is repeal of half the provisions in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act (including prohibition of secondary boycotts and sympathy strikes). This anti-labor law, passed over the veto of President Truman, defanged the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act), ushered in the toxic phenomenon of ""right to work"" states, and rendered organized labor more or less powerless by cutting its nuts off.Beginning in the late 1970s, in response to the implementation of UAW ""emergency concessions,"" and continuing into the early 1980s, when President Reagan declared ""open season"" on organized labor by firing more than 11,000 PATCO workers (air traffic controllers), union activists have been engaged in a lively debate over how best to spend AFL-CIO funds. One thing the House of Labor has plenty of is money.While some people want to see the lion's share of AFL-CIO discretionary spending used for national organizing drives, others want to see it spent on stuff like advertising, community awareness, ""education"" and political donations. Not that the Democrats have done organized labor any favors lately, but I've always favored the political donation route. Consider: If reactionary, draconian laws were what crippled us, then progressive, labor-friendly laws must be what makes us whole.An officer with an International that must remain nameless, once suggested a crazy idea. Given that the AFL-CIO spent an estimated $50 million trying (and failing) to organize Walmart, and given that lobbyists and donors are the mother's milk of politics, and given that money has already poisoned the well, the AFL-CIO should consider bribery.They should identify 50 congressmen who could a make difference in the outcome of critical labor votes and then have a bag man discreetly deliver each of them $200,000 in cash. Don't call it a ""bribe."" Call it a ""donation."" Donations of $200,000 to 40 key House members and 10 key senators would amount to $10 million, which the AFL-CIO could easily afford. It's clean, it's quick, and it beats the hell out of wasting money on futile Wal-Mart campaigns. In return, unfair labor laws are repealed and the American worker is given a fighting chance. Let's not get all self-righteous. After all, isn't this how the military-industrial complex functions? Hasn't the Saudi royal family, going all the way back to FDR, donated millions of dollars to the U.S. to gain preferential treatment? As Tom Hagen said to Santino Corleone, ""It's business, Sonny!"""

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit largely upheld that ruling last month. But on Thursday the full court split sharply on whether to rehear the case, with a majority declining to do so and six judges dissenting.“The will of Michigan’s people, expressed through their legislature, was to have the same system as the large majority of states, containing the large majority of voters, of all types of races and parties,” wrote one of the dissenting judges.In its emergency request to the Supreme Court on Friday, the state included this and other case history, insisting that requiring voters to vote for individual candidates ― rather than in one shot for a party’s entire ticket ― doesn’t harm Michigan voters and is in fact accepted across much of the country.“Michigan has joined 40 other states by requiring voters to actually vote for each candidate they intend to support — in other words, by eliminating straight-ticket voting,” read the state’s filing, which was addressed to Justice Elena Kagan. “This change is not a burden on voting — it is the very act of voting.”Lawyers for the state set a hard deadline of Sept. 8 for the court to act, pointing to ballot printing deadlines set by law and other logistics ahead of Election Day. Perhaps to account for that timeline, Kagan asked proponents of straight-ticket voting to respond to Michigan’s request by Sept. 7.In light of the Supreme Court’s makeup and the divisiveness of voting rights matters, it’s unlikely a majority of the justices will side with Michigan’s request. One voting rights expert, Richard Hasen, predicted the state’s chances weren’t that good.Friday’s filing is the latest in a string of actions the Supreme Court has been asked to take to put on hold lower court rulings that could impact the November elections. Its most prominent move so far, an order preventing North Carolina from enforcing its restrictive voting law, found the justices divided across ideological lines."

By officially ratifying the climate agreement reached in April, the two countries move the Paris deal a major step toward taking effect this year, the White House said.More than 170 nations signed the Paris agreement, committing to fight climate change by cutting carbon emissions. The deal requires at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions to take the additional step of ratification before it takes effect. Before Saturday’s action by the U.S. and China, 24 nations had formally joined, accounting for just 1.08 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations.

Obama addressed Pacific island leaders and delegates of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s World Conservation Congress, which kicked off Thursday in Honolulu. There, the president spoke about the urgency of addressing climate change, saying large emitters, namely the U.S. and China, “have a special responsibility to act to make sure that countries willing to do their part move past the dirty phase of development to move into a clean energy strategy.”Obama credited U.S. and China leadership as a major reason for the agreement in Paris, and said he plans to continue deepening the U.S. relationship with China even after he leaves office.“There’s no conflict between a healthy economy and a healthy planet,” Obama told leaders in Honolulu.When asked about the U.S.-China relationship during a press event at the IUCN conference Thursday, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said the two countries worked very hard in advance of the Paris negotiations.“One of the most important things we can do around the world is create an environment where business interests align with environmental interests,” Jewell said.Deese told reporters that climate change is “one of the best examples of the way that President Obama thinks about conducing foreign policy and using American power as a force for good.”“In the wake of the Copenhagen agreement in 2009, he recognized if we were going to reset a global approach to actually successfully addressing climate change, we were going to need to redefine the U.S. relationship with China on this issue,” Deese said. “For decades previously, it was as if China and the U.S. were the captains of two different teams in approaching climate change, and if we were going to find a path out of Copenhagen’s failure, we were going to need to address that.”"

Then Trump, Carson and members of Trump’s campaign entourage stopped by the house in the city where Carson grew up.A CNN reporter asked Carson to describe the visit. But Carson, suddenly concerned about the fate of his luggage, abandoned the televised live interview.The abrupt departure is consistent with Carson’s past political miscues.The world-renowned neurosurgeon is celebrated for his rise from an upbringing marred by poverty and crime. But as a presidential candidate, he developed a reputation for ill-informed comments and odd behavior, like failing to enter the debate stage at the right time.Interview aside, the visit appears to have gone smoothly. Carson showed Trump the outside of the house and they spoke with its current owner, Felicia Reese, according to the campaign pool report.“This house is worth a lot of money!” Trump joked to Reese, suggesting that Carson’s fame had increased its value.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Tom Ridge (R), and real estate investor/reality show contestant/former NFL player Shawn Bullard. As the roundtable meeting wrapped up (and press was allowed back in), Bullard praised Trump. “I appreciate you coming here today,” said Bullard. “I have been a Trump supporter since I was in college back in 2001. I believe that you are the answer. I’m a full supporter. And also ... you have actually inspired me.”Daphne Goggins, the Republican leader of Philadelphia’s 16th Ward, told Trump, “What you’re saying about the Democratic plan ― that plantation that they want black people on ― it’s the truth. I will say it again.”The Huffington Post asked the Trump campaign about the implication of Goggins’ remark ― that at the meeting, he had characterized Democrats’ economic policy as “a plantation” ― but a campaign spokeswoman did not reply.Right after the roundtable discussion, Trump talked with Shalga Hightower, whose 20-year-old daughter Iofemi was killed in neighboring New Jersey in 2007 by gang members, some of whom were undocumented immigrants.In his comments, Trump returned to a familiar theme: all the violent crimes he claims are committed by undocumented immigrants. “These people coming in and they shouldn’t be here. And they’re killing not only children, they’re killing people that are in the military, retired military people. A 90-year-old man was killed. It’s a terrible situation,” he said.An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently live in the United States. There is no evidence that they commit crimes at higher rates than American citizens.Together, the two Philadelphia events showcase the difficulty that Trump faces in seeking to appear concerned about problems of poverty and crime in communities of color, while also pushing his law-and-order platform, which has been accused of painting minorities as imminent threats to their neighbors.On Saturday, he is set to visit Detroit for a much-hyped visit to a black church. The candidate will sit down privately with Bishop Wayne Jackson and discuss issues of race, opportunity and education. Their talk will be aired later.But even before he goes, that trip too has highlighted Trump’s struggles with speaking to communities of color. Earlier this week, he canceled a planned speech at the black church in favor of the pre-taped interview with pre-approved questions.On Wednesday, Trump made a quick trip to Mexico to met with President Enrique Peña Nieto, an apparent attempt to mend some fences with Latino voters. Yet just hours later, the GOP nominee took the stage in Phoenix and delivered a dark and scathingly angry speech about the perils of both legal immigration and undocumented migration.The following day, nearly a half-dozen members of his newly formed National Hispanic Advisory Council resigned.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

This is because Earth’s atmosphere absorbs some of the sun’s light, creating an ill-defined edge.

Since then more than 30 other French municipalities, many of them along the French Riviera, have followed suit. A few weeks later, on August 26, the French Council of State, France's highest administrative court, overturned the ban and ruled that mayors do not have the right to ban burkinis. The ruling was in response to a challenge that had been filed against the ban imposed by the mayor of Villeneuve-Loubet. Many of the mayors involved vowed to ignore the court ruling. The ban joins an already existing French ban on the burqa, a full body covering that covers the lower face and has a meshed cloth over the eyes, and a niqab, which is identical except that a veil covers the lower face and the eyes are uncovered. The ban went into effect in April 2011, and mandates fines of 150 euros (165 dollars). Burqas, niqabs, headscarves and other ""conspicuous religious symbols"" were banned in French schools in 2004.The issue has sparked a worldwide media frenzy. In France, Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared that he supported banning burkinis. Pouring fuel on the fire, Vallis, on August 29, pointed out that France's national symbol, Marianne, had her ""breasts exposed and ... that she wasn't wearing a veil."" Just to be clear, the statue of Liberty at the Marianne Monument in Paris has one breast exposed while in Delacroix's iconic painting, Liberty Leading the People, Liberty, which is often used as a depiction of Marianne, has both breasts exposed. Whether Vallis is proposing to ban the burkini in favor of the monokini is unclear. His comment was widely dismissed as moronic.Not to be outdone, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who is widely expected to challenge Françoise Hollande for the presidency next year, declared that if elected, he would immediately ban the burkini. Predictably, Marine Le Pen, the president of France's anti-immigration National Right party urged that the ban be immediately adopted nationally. According to a BBC report, recent polls indicate that 64 percent of the French public supported the ban and that another 30 percent had no opinion.Delacroix's painting, Liberty Leading the PeopleThe ban generated broad international criticism. A widely cited New York Times editorial on August 18, described the ban as paternalistic, bigoted and hypocritical. Scores of protests from ""burkini rallies"" to a ""wear what you want beach party,"" organized on a makeshift beach in front of France's embassy in London, were held in the weeks following the ban.What exactly is a burkini? Basically it is a swimsuit that covers everything except the hands, feet and face. It was designed by Australian fashion designer Aheda Zanetti. She owns the trademark to the words burqini and burkini, although the terms are now in generic use. A similar style of bathing suit, which consists of pants and a hooded shirt, called a veilkini, although it doesn't actually have a veil, has also been introduced.Stylistically, the burkini is not all that different from the wet suit used by scuba divers and often used by surfers and long distance swimmers. While it is associated with Muslim dress, and in particular with the Koran's pronouncement that ""women should dress modestly,"" it is not traditional attire - having been invented only in 2004. According to Zanetti, about 40 percent of her customers are not Muslims. The outfits have been popular in Israel among the Jewish Haredi. They are also becoming increasingly popular in certain Asian countries where pale skin is considered desirable. The product is already available at North America retailers, including Amazon. The larger question is whether a society should ban articles of clothing that impede accurate identification in the interest of public safety? Courts have long held that public security trumps personal privacy, especially in those instances where it would impede proper identification. That's why you are asked to remove your hat or sunglasses when you cross the border or are pulled over for a traffic violation. Ditto when you go to vote or are giving testimony in a court of law. That's why police can operate CCTV cameras and film you without your consent. You can rail all you want that it is a violation of personal privacy. In an environment where every crowd is a potential terrorist target, anonymity in a public setting is simply not compatible with public safety. That holds true regardless of whether you are wearing a burqa, a hockey mask or a Donald Trump Halloween mask (rumored to be this Halloween's best seller although Hillary Clinton is not far behind). Afghan women wearing burqasA specific ban on burqas or niqabs will invariably be seen as being anti-Muslim in inspiration. A ban on any article of clothing that prevents proper identification in the interest of public safety, however, is not prejudicial or targeting any specific group. So, yes, that means that you should not be able to wear Halloween masks, surgical masks, hockey masks, balaclavas or ski masks or anything else that impedes identification, outside of their specific work related uses, in a public setting. In private you can wear anything you want, in public it's an altogether different matter.The ban on burkinis is silly and misguided. We have no business criminalizing fashion, even if we think that it makes a statement that is considered offensive. While it may offend the fashion sensibilities of some of France's mayors, the burkini does not pose a threat to public safety. The burqa, however, along with Halloween masks and any other article of clothing that impedes identification, does pose such a threat. For that reason, leave the burkini alone, but yes ban the burqa, Halloween masks and anything else that prevents the proper identification of its wearer."

While the Paris Agreement represents significant progress toward addressing this global challenge, international leaders need to further accelerate emissions reductions to keep global temperature rise ""well below 2°C above-pre-industrial levels and aiming for 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" as called for in the landmark agreement.  A landscape of forests and mountains in Myanmar. Photo Credit: © Minzayar Oo / WWF-USAnd that need is more urgent than ever. With current greenhouse gas emissions levels, we are tracking toward a much more severe scenario: a planet that is 3 to 5°C degrees warmer by the end of the century and potentially much sooner. As we have already experienced with increasingly extreme and variable weather around the world--from unprecedented heat waves to increasingly frequent and intense ""1,000 year"" floods occurring year after year -- even just 1 degree Celsius of warming yields devastating impacts on humans and wildlife. Building resilience to these increasing extremes and many more unavoidable effects of warming is imperative. It is especially important in developing countries like Myanmar, where millions of subsistence farmers with limited access to services and poor infrastructure are disproportionately vulnerable. By some metrics, Myanmar is the second most vulnerable country to extreme hazards like floods and extreme storms. I have seen this first hand through our engagement with local communities in the dry zone town of Pakkoku, where changing rainfall patterns have already made farming in an arid region even more difficult, forcing people to move to the capital as climate refugees. As we are increasingly seeing around the world, one of the best ways to help communities like these adapt to such changes by working with nature to increase resilience, from providing coastal defenses against storms to reducing flood risk for millions of people downstream. Today, Myanmar is in a unique position to do exactly this: it is transitioning to democracy and rapidly growing its economy after decades of military rule - which effectively limited economic growth and exploitation of its natural resources for the past 50 years. As a result, the country now has an opportunity in its development trajectory to increase prosperity for millions while also ""baking in"" climate resilience from the start, in part through protecting its abundant natural wealth. That's wonderful news for conservationists worldwide as Myanmar is home to some of the last truly pristine, healthy ecosystems and rich biodiversity on our planet.When other nations faced critical decision points like these in the past, a deficit of information about the value in preserving nature often contributed to unsustainable development outcomes that also contributed to increased vulnerability to climate change. The economic benefits of natural resource exploitation through carbon intensive and extractive industries like timber, mining, and oil and gas have always been well understood. Yet, those associated with protecting and conserving ecosystems and biodiversity and enhancing climate resilience -- clean air, water, carbon sequestration, local climate control, flood retention, or coastal defenses against extreme storms -- have been more obscure. But now we have the power (and the data) to change that dynamic. Now common technological tools, like geospatial information systems (GIS), which make use of high-quality satellite imagery, are being used in ever more innovative ways to help us put prices on these benefits. As a result, today conservation scientists can produce comparable, ""apples to apples"" assessments of the economic values provided by intact, healthy ecosystems. And every year, we are learning new ways to conserve nature as new research and studies add to our understanding of how benefits from on-the-ground preservation can outweigh those from extraction and exploitation. We have much more to learn, especially from a largely understudied element of this growing field: how exactly can intact ecosystems help us adapt to our changing climate? That's why I'm here at the IUCN World Conservation Congress this week. I'm here to talk with conservation practitioners and leaders from around the world about our efforts to develop this kind of new information for decision-makers in Myanmar. WWF is working with diverse partners and the national government to create nationwide maps of Myanmar's ecosystem services and explain how these natural systems - mangroves, forests, watersheds -- buffer against both immediate and longer term climate change impacts. Our analysis shows how Myanmar's intact inland forests provide clean water by reducing soil runoff into rivers and streams, reduce flooding by retaining and slowing down water flows, and how its coastal mangroves and reefs provide key protection against increasingly extreme storms. With this improved understanding of the services these natural systems provide, Myanmar can make progress toward its goal of developing a green, resilient economy. And, it can become a model for how to leapfrog over standard brown development and manage the ever increasing impacts of climate change in the 21st century. WWF will continue working with our partners in Myanmar and around the world to provide information on the enormous benefits nature provides to local livelihoods and national economies. In this way, we can help governments around the world make similar investment and planning decisions that reduce the difficult trade-offs between economic growth and ecosystem conservation, all while building resilience to the effects of our changing climate.This post is part of a series on the World Conservation Congress taking place this week. Held every four years, it brings together about 6,000 people, including heads of state, government officials, business leaders, representatives from indigenous groups, scientists, academics, influencers, educators, artists and NGOs, from all over the world to discuss and decide on solutions to the world's most pressing environmental challenges.

28,GREEN,"In Myanmar, Nature Can Help Communities Face Climate Challenges","Ryan Bartlett, ContributorSenior Specialist, Climate Resilience, World Wildlife Fund",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-myanmar-nature-can-hel_b_11802372.html,"Building resilience to increasing extremes and many more unavoidable effects of warming is imperative.

A landscape of forests and mountains in Myanmar. Photo Credit: © Minzayar Oo / WWF-USAnd that need is more urgent than ever. With current greenhouse gas emissions levels, we are tracking toward a much more severe scenario: a planet that is 3 to 5°C degrees warmer by the end of the century and potentially much sooner. As we have already experienced with increasingly extreme and variable weather around the world--from unprecedented heat waves to increasingly frequent and intense ""1,000 year"" floods occurring year after year -- even just 1 degree Celsius of warming yields devastating impacts on humans and wildlife. Building resilience to these increasing extremes and many more unavoidable effects of warming is imperative. It is especially important in developing countries like Myanmar, where millions of subsistence farmers with limited access to services and poor infrastructure are disproportionately vulnerable. By some metrics, Myanmar is the second most vulnerable country to extreme hazards like floods and extreme storms. I have seen this first hand through our engagement with local communities in the dry zone town of Pakkoku, where changing rainfall patterns have already made farming in an arid region even more difficult, forcing people to move to the capital as climate refugees. As we are increasingly seeing around the world, one of the best ways to help communities like these adapt to such changes by working with nature to increase resilience, from providing coastal defenses against storms to reducing flood risk for millions of people downstream. Today, Myanmar is in a unique position to do exactly this: it is transitioning to democracy and rapidly growing its economy after decades of military rule - which effectively limited economic growth and exploitation of its natural resources for the past 50 years. As a result, the country now has an opportunity in its development trajectory to increase prosperity for millions while also ""baking in"" climate resilience from the start, in part through protecting its abundant natural wealth. That's wonderful news for conservationists worldwide as Myanmar is home to some of the last truly pristine, healthy ecosystems and rich biodiversity on our planet.When other nations faced critical decision points like these in the past, a deficit of information about the value in preserving nature often contributed to unsustainable development outcomes that also contributed to increased vulnerability to climate change. The economic benefits of natural resource exploitation through carbon intensive and extractive industries like timber, mining, and oil and gas have always been well understood. Yet, those associated with protecting and conserving ecosystems and biodiversity and enhancing climate resilience -- clean air, water, carbon sequestration, local climate control, flood retention, or coastal defenses against extreme storms -- have been more obscure. But now we have the power (and the data) to change that dynamic. Now common technological tools, like geospatial information systems (GIS), which make use of high-quality satellite imagery, are being used in ever more innovative ways to help us put prices on these benefits. As a result, today conservation scientists can produce comparable, ""apples to apples"" assessments of the economic values provided by intact, healthy ecosystems. And every year, we are learning new ways to conserve nature as new research and studies add to our understanding of how benefits from on-the-ground preservation can outweigh those from extraction and exploitation. We have much more to learn, especially from a largely understudied element of this growing field: how exactly can intact ecosystems help us adapt to our changing climate? That's why I'm here at the IUCN World Conservation Congress this week. I'm here to talk with conservation practitioners and leaders from around the world about our efforts to develop this kind of new information for decision-makers in Myanmar. WWF is working with diverse partners and the national government to create nationwide maps of Myanmar's ecosystem services and explain how these natural systems - mangroves, forests, watersheds -- buffer against both immediate and longer term climate change impacts. Our analysis shows how Myanmar's intact inland forests provide clean water by reducing soil runoff into rivers and streams, reduce flooding by retaining and slowing down water flows, and how its coastal mangroves and reefs provide key protection against increasingly extreme storms. With this improved understanding of the services these natural systems provide, Myanmar can make progress toward its goal of developing a green, resilient economy. And, it can become a model for how to leapfrog over standard brown development and manage the ever increasing impacts of climate change in the 21st century. WWF will continue working with our partners in Myanmar and around the world to provide information on the enormous benefits nature provides to local livelihoods and national economies. In this way, we can help governments around the world make similar investment and planning decisions that reduce the difficult trade-offs between economic growth and ecosystem conservation, all while building resilience to the effects of our changing climate.This post is part of a series on the World Conservation Congress taking place this week.

29,BUSINESS,10 Ways Ridiculously Successful People Think Differently,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-ways-ridiculously-succ_b_11803810.html,"Successful people come from all walks of life, yet they all have one thing in common: where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to embrace and obstacles to overcome.",2016-09-03,2016-08-31-1472678852-596968-10WaysRidiculouslySuccessfulPeopleThinkDifferentlyHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-31-1472678852-596968-10WaysRidiculouslySuccessfulPeopleThinkDifferentlyHP-thumb.jpg,"Successful people come from all walks of life, yet they all have one thing in common: where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to embrace and obstacles to overcome.Their confidence in the face of hardship is driven by their ability to let go of the negativity that holds so many otherwise sensible people back.Obstacles do not block the path; they are the path.This perspective helps successful people to think differently to everyone else, which is important, because if you think like everyone else, no matter how smart or experienced you are, you'll hit the same ceiling. By thinking outside the box and going against the grain, successful people rise above their limitations.We all know how important it is to approach problems with radical optimism and creativity, but this is easier said than done. In a study conducted at Adobe, 96% of employees identified creativity as essential to their success, both in terms of their income and the value they bring to the world. What's more, 78% wished they were capable of thinking differently, believing that they would progress through their careers more quickly if they did. Too often we attribute creative and ""different"" thinking to natural, innate characteristics that belong only to the lucky. The truth is that you can study how ridiculously successful people think and incorporate their approach into your repertoire.1. They're confident. If only we knew of all the great ideas that never came to fruition because people lacked the confidence to put them into action. Successful people confidently act on their ideas, because they know that a failed idea is not a reflection of their ability; instead, they see it as a wonderful learning opportunity.2. They're composed. Ultra-successful people are composed, because they constantly monitor their emotions and understand them and they use this knowledge in the moment to react with self-control to challenging situations. When things go downhill, they are persistently calm and frustratingly content (frustrating to those who aren't, at least). They know that no matter how good or bad things get, everything changes with time. All they can do is to adapt and adjust to stay happy and in control. If you'd like an objective measure of how you do at this, consider taking an emotional intelligence test.3. They're honest. Super-successful people trust that honesty and integrity, though painful at times, always work out for the best in the long run. They know that honesty allows for genuine connections with people and that lying always comes back to bite you in the end. 4. They seek out small victories. Successful people like to challenge themselves and to compete, even when their efforts yield only small victories. Small victories build new androgen receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for reward and motivation. This increase in androgen receptors enhances the influence of testosterone, which further increases their confidence and eagerness to tackle challenges. When you achieve a series of small victories, the boost in your confidence can last for months.5. They're always learning. Super-successful people often know more than others do, because they're constantly trying to learn. They vow to constantly grow, and they fill every spare moment with self-education. They don't do this because it's ""the right thing to do""; they do it because it's their passion. They're always looking for opportunities to improve and new things to learn about themselves and the world around them. Instead of succumbing to their fear of looking stupid, truly exceptional people just ask the questions on their mind, because they would rather learn something new than appear smart.  6. They expose themselves to a variety of people.There's no easier way to learn to think differently than spending time with someone whose strengths are your weaknesses or whose ideas are radically different from your own. This exposure sparks new ideas and makes you well rounded. This is why we see so many great companies with co-founders who stand in stark contrast to each other. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from Apple were a prime example. Neither could have succeeded without the other.7. They keep an open mind. Exposing yourself to a variety of people is useless if you spend that time disagreeing with them and comforting yourself with your own opinions. Successful people recognize that every perspective provides an opportunity for growth. You need to practice empathy by putting yourself in the other person's shoes so that you can understand how their perspective makes sense (at least, to them). A great way to keep an open mind is to try to glean at least one interesting or useful thing from every conversation you have.8. They're fearless. Fear is nothing more than a lingering emotion that's fueled by your imagination. Danger is real. Danger is the uncomfortable rush of adrenaline you get when you almost step in front of a bus; fear is a choice. Exceptional people know this better than anyone does, so they flip fear on its head. Instead of letting fear take over, they're addicted to the euphoric feeling they get from conquering their fears.  9. They turn tedious tasks into games. Every job entails some degree of tedium. For most people, tedium leads to sloppy, rushed work. Only the most successful people find ways to make the tedious interesting. By turning tedious work into a game, they challenge themselves and produce high-quality work, making things interesting in the process.  10. They dream big but remain grounded. Successful people reach for the seemingly impossible, but they do so in a way that is actionable and realistic. While you may not know exactly how you're going to achieve your dream, you need to make progress no matter how small the steps. For example, Elon Musk's goal at SpacEx is to ""Occupy Mars."" While this is a big dream, Musk keeps it realistic by engaging in regular steps that, some day, may get him there. SpacEx just landed a rocket upright on a boat in the ocean for the first time ever. It's a far cry from colonizing Mars, but it's an essential step in the process.Bringing It All TogetherThe above behaviors can make any of us more successful if we use them every day. Give them a try, and see where they take you.What other habits set ultra-successful people apart from the rest? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

The message has been uniformly welcomed and (apparently) enjoyed, even though in part two I get pretty doggone down and dirty about what I call the ""spiritual ego"" -- you know, that part of us that thinks well of itself for going to church on a pretty spring morning when we could be out playing golf. That voice inside our head that tells us we're better, wiser, more humble, more pleasing if we believe in a deity in a certain way ... better than people who worship deity in another way ... certainly better and wiser than the people who fail to worship at all.Part two is all about how the human ego, which arises from our sensory perception of separation from others and the divine, is strengthened by pursuing ""spirituality."" ""We don't know who we really are,"" I say. ""We think we're human beings. We identify with our name and face and sexual orientation, our weight and IQ and professional status, our address, FB account and socioeconomic bracket--and yes, our religious/spiritual beliefs and denominational label.""We pay lip service to unity, all the while unconsciously carving ourselves into pieces by speaking words, saying prayers and singing songs that clearly indicate we believe God is separate and outside of us, that heaven is better than Earth and that spirituality is something we can pursue--a meaningful characteristic we can adopt that will make us better people. ""And yet God isn't outside us, heaven isn't a place and we aren't really 'people.' It's all an illusion. The world and our bodies aren't even physical. They're interpenetrating fields of intangible energy/information that appear as if they were physical.""I watch the nodding heads, as I talk. The earnest faces. I say, ""In truth we are the vast I AM itself--Source Intelligence animating 'form' on a thrill ride across Eternity. Being 'human' is a story in a dream. Spirituality is a concept. Being a 'spiritual human' is a story within a story -- a mental game of identity that keeps us spinning our wheels for years ... for lifetimes ... pursuing the unattainable goal of becoming what we already are through improving the illusion of what we are not.""  At the end I stress the subtlety of our stories - how easy it is to get caught in human/ego beliefs about how things are ... how easily we get lost in delusion ... how important it is to be critically aware of words of separation that create more story ... taking us deeper into fantasy, away from who we really are.Then I sit down.My talk is followed by applause. Sometimes even a few whoops of appreciation. And then ... the dream proceeds. The collection is made, the offering is blessed and, almost always, the service is closed with some variation of the Lord's Prayer: ""Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven ...""And I want to leap to my feet, spin around, and scream, ""THIS is exactly what I was talking about just five minutes ago! This is what traps us! ""Can you hear what you're saying? God isn't a 'He' or a father. Those are stories. He isn't in Heaven because heaven isn't a place. It's a state of mind that comes with the awareness that we are the divine. His will is not separate from our own. Jesus said it loud and clear. He said it using the language of the times--language that could be understood.""Jesus didn't have quantum physics revealing the true nature of our reality to the world. He didn't have psychology and words like 'consciousness' in his vocabulary. He spoke in parables--stories--because that's what could be heard at the time! He said, 'My Father and I are one.' And people tortured and killed him for saying it.""But that was two thousand years ago. It's time to wake up out of the story and come home!""But I don't do it. So far I haven't had the cojones. But damn, do I ever fantasize ..."

What matters is that he built a ""huge"" audience in front of which he performed well.",2016-09-03,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 31, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb828b6250000cf003a1aa0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Late last year, as the primaries were just heating up, pundits and commentators were busy trying to make sense of the Donald Trump phenomenon. His stump speeches were more akin to the stream of consciousness rantings of an out-of-control id than what was expected from a serious presidential candidate. He frequently contradicted himself and, more often than not, told bold-faced lies. He insulted groups and individuals, making his party's leaders squirm. And yet his crowds were huge and passionate and his poll numbers were high and getting higher. The political class was baffled.One Sunday morning, the Washington Post and New York Times both ran what purported to be ""analysis"" pieces arguing that Trump might not be as right-wing as some feared. Their methodology was questionable, at best. Both authors argued that maybe the best way to discern the candidate's real policy positions would be to take his contradictory pronouncements on any number of issues and attempt to reconcile them. Both concluded that maybe the candidate was indulging in his own crude form of triangulation and that the real Donald Trump was neither a true conservative nor a liberal, but a moderate, at heart!The entire exercise was as amusing as it was wrong-headed. What they didn't understand then, and what apparently many pundits still don't get, is that policies, or even words themselves, don't matter to Donald Trump. It's the performance and the reaction it gets that counts. All the rest is misdirection designed to confound gullible analysts and garner more attention.This game of misdirection was on full display during the past few weeks leading up to Trump's big immigration performance on Wednesday. The speech had been scheduled and then cancelled a few weeks back--all of which made its delivery more anticipated. And so while Hillary Clinton was raising money, delivering serious policy addresses, and staving off more bad news related to her never-ending email saga and issues related to the Clinton Foundation, Trump was titillating the media with the possibility that his position on immigration might be evolving.Was he moderating his views to appease Republican office-holders who needed their standard-bearer to moderate his positions? Was he attempting to broaden his own appeal to win Hispanic and African American voters? Was he finally making the long-awaited shift to becoming ""a real presidential candidate?""While television pundits bloviated and the columnists filled pages of newsprint speculating about his intentions, Trump gleefully led them all on a wild goose chase. Even the candidate's supporters got caught up in the game. Some attempted to explain away a possible shift, arguing that ""he never really meant that stuff about mass deportations or the wall"". Others worried that any softening would cost him dearly since his base support came from hard core nativists who believed that the wall would be built, Mexico would pay for it, and all ""illegals"" would be deported. The day before his much hyped ""policy speech"" on immigration, Trump announced that he would fly to Mexico to meet with that country's president. All eyes were now just where he wanted them--on him. The media frenzy grew. It was ""all Trump, all the time"". One network even featured a countdown clock in the corner of the screen counting down the seconds to the ""big speech"". What was thought to be ""a bold and risky"" meeting in Mexico turned out to be a rather ho-hum affair. The wildly unpredictable controversial American candidate met with the wildly unpopular Mexican president and both said little that was of interest to anyone. It was left to the media to make the absence of fireworks into a big story. And then it was on to the speech.What I always find intriguing about Trump policy speeches is the delivery. Whenever he attempts a major policy address he has taken to reading his remarks, rather awkwardly, from a teleprompter. But Trump, being Trump, can't help but go off-script. He reads a line and then makes a comment--as if to agree with what he just read. The overall effect is a bit comical. The speech was reported by Trump opponents to be ""an exercise in hateful rhetoric"" filled with misstatements of fact and by supporters to be a ""restatement, with added details, of Trump's hardline position"" on immigration. In reality, it was both and more--it was a show, and, for Trump, that's what matters.Fact checkers had a field day pointing out that Trump misstated, exaggerated, or just plain made up statistics or claims contained in his remarks. To his already bigoted position on which immigrants would be allowed into America, Trump added new, deeply disturbing criteria--new immigrants must be shown to ""share our values and love our people"" and that they be selected on the basis of ""their likelihood of success in US society"".But the speech was also filled with Trumpian contradictions. At one point, the candidate reaffirmed that there would be no amnesty and that those here illegally would have to return to their countries, while in another place he suggested that those who are here illegally who have families and are working hard could stay--but then left that hanging without clarification. One network, falling for this misdirection, ran a lower third saying ""Trump softens, hardens, softens stand"".In the end, however, it's important not to be carried away with analyzing what he said or attempting to discern what he meant. It's a fool's errand trying to make sense out of nonsense. Because for Donald Trump, the policy formulations don't matter, neither do the misstatements, exaggerations or contradictions. What matters is that he built a ""huge"" audience in front of which he performed well. He appeared presidential in the afternoon and then reverted to hate-filled demagogue at night--and his folks loved the incitement and loved him. Like everything else he does, it was a show. All the rest was misdirection designed to confound and draw more attention--and he loved every minute of it. Follow @jjz1600 for more. "

If the iconic retailer Cadenhead is a shrine to Scotch whisky, then its retail rival The Whiskey Exchange (TWE) is Scotch whisky's cathedral. The giant store, which recently relocated to larger facilities near Covent Garden, stocks 800 single malts and 200 other whiskies, one of the largest selections of any retail whiskey store in the world, not to mention that it stocks another 800 bottles of other spirits. According to Andrew Milne, Events Manager, TWE can deliver on 48 hours' notice an additional 3000 varieties of whiskey drawn from its online offerings. With around 4,000 different varieties of whiskey, the majority of them Scotch, it can also claim to be the Internet's largest purveyor of whiskey in general and of Scotch in particular.The original The Whiskey Exchange was opened in 1999, as an Internet based retailer of whiskies and fine spirits. Once the company was established it opened its first store in 2005, in the Vinopolis wine complex near London Bridge. Founded in 1999, the Vinopolis facility was part a wine inspired theme park and part a wine and spirits focused shopping center. The complex offered visitors ""virtual tours"" of all of the world's major wine regions as well as master classes in tasting and wine appreciation. It also hosted a restaurant, several wine bars, as well as retail shops specializing in wines and spirits. The venue was also used to showcase wines that had medaled at the Decanter World Wine Awards. The retail store quickly became a fixture in London's retail whiskey scene, as well as a favorite stopover for TWE's worldwide customers. The store was recognized as Independent Spirits Retailer of the Year at the Drinks Retailing Awards in 2009, 2010 and 2011. In 2014, Whisky Magazine chose it as Overall Whiskey Retailer of the Year, as part of the magazine's Icons of Whiskey Award. The company had always intended to open a second, larger store near Covent Garden, but the new store became a necessity when the owners of Vinopolis, where the previous store was located, sold the retail complex in 2015. TWE has already announced that it is looking for a new site for a second store in the London Bridge area. The TWE's current whiskey selection of 1000 different expressions, most of which are single malt Scotches, will increase to around 1,200 expressions by the end of 2016. The store intends to start stocking the complete collection of Macallan Fine and Rare vintages and the Glenfarclas's Family Cask offerings, as well as an expanded range of what Events Manager Andrew Milne describes as ""very rare premium whiskies"" from other distilleries. The Macallan Fine and Rare Vintage Collection Among some of the ""rare"" expressions currently offered are a selection of two-dozen 50-year-old whiskies ranging from a 1919 Springbank, one of only 17 bottled in 1970, and available for a cool $72,000, to a Gordon and MacPhail 1966 Banff that was bottled in 2015, and is a relative bargain at $1,100. Order it via mail order and avoid the value added tax and it can be yours for only $925. Since the Banff distillery has been closed for more than three decades, this bottling is truly one of a kind. The Macallan selections will be housed in a special Macallan Room downstairs from the main floor. If the store is Scotch whisky's cathedral, then I suppose this room would be the Macallan chapel. I wonder if they will make it available for weddings? The company also offers a broad selection of limited release bottlings. Most of these are single cask offerings from specialty bottlers like Signatory and Gordon & MacPhail, but also include special bottlings, which are exclusive to TWE. Some of the specialty bottlings are only offered in the retail store in order to differentiate its selection from the online offerings. One more reason to visit the store if you are ever in London, although TWE's legions of online fans need little incentive to drop by the store should they find themselves in the city. Among the company's most requested categories are Japanese whiskies and American bourbon. The former category still has supply issues according to Milne. Limited edition bottlings of bourbon are also showing consistent strength. Scotch whiskey is still TWE's most significant market segment, however, and remains hugely popular among the company's customers. American customers make up the company's largest Internet customer segment and Canada is, from a percentage standpoint, one of its fastest growing markets as, too, is Asia. Rare and limited editions continue to attract strong demand from the United States and northern Europe, according to Milne, while anything with the Macallan name continues to find keen interest among Asian Scotch enthusiasts. TWE's customers are predominantly male, typically between the ages of 35 to 65. Although the company does a majority of its sales online, its Internet sales are also an important driver of traffic in its retail store. The Whiskey Exchange's 40 liter cask program.  TWE offers a custom filling in its store from a selection of 40 liter cask barrels. The instore fill program features a blended rum, a blended cognac, and a choice from an ever changing selection of blended single malts from Scotland's various regions. Currently, the Scotch selection features a nine-year-old (YO) Covent Garden Select Reserve Blended Malt drawn from throughout Scotland's whisky producing regions, a nine YO Covent Garden Peated Reserve blend and a 14 YO Covent Garden Sherry Cask Reserve blend. The instore cask program is extremely popular with customers as each blend is unique and is rarely repeated. It typically takes around a month to cycle through a particular cask, although popular offerings can sell out within a matter of days. To comply with current Scotch Whisky Association rules, the casks now need to be lined with an inert material. In addition to its broad whiskey selection, TWE also has a growing specialty in rums. The company was able to secure the last ever consignment of official Royal Navy rum. This batch was released in 2011 and there are still a few bottles available. It was packaged as ""Black Tot,"" to commemorate the last serving of rum aboard Royal Navy ships at precisely 6 bells in the forenoon watch (11 a.m. to you land lubbers). The occasion was dubbed Black Tot Day by die hard traditionalists. It ended a 300-year-old Royal Navy tradition. A 1919 Springbank bottled in 1970 TWE also directly imports high end Zafra rum from Panama. Starting in 2017, the company also plans to launch a series of exclusive rum bottlings. According to Milne, ""rum is one of the first brown spirits people drink so it is a great stepping stone for getting people into whiskey."" The store holds regular rum tastings and recently featured tastings with Alexandre Gabriel from Plantation Rum, as well as with noted Barbados rum producer Richard Seale. The Whiskey Exchange is one of London's most iconic whiskey merchants.

Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/icons-of-whiskey-retailin_b_11834040.html,,2016-09-03,2016-09-02-1472831527-3085791-whiskyexchangefinerareshelf,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-02-1472831527-3085791-whiskyexchangefinerareshelf-thumb,"The Whiskey Exchange at Covent Garden In recent years, London has become a mecca for fine whiskey retailers. If the iconic retailer Cadenhead is a shrine to Scotch whisky, then its retail rival The Whiskey Exchange (TWE) is Scotch whisky's cathedral. The giant store, which recently relocated to larger facilities near Covent Garden, stocks 800 single malts and 200 other whiskies, one of the largest selections of any retail whiskey store in the world, not to mention that it stocks another 800 bottles of other spirits. According to Andrew Milne, Events Manager, TWE can deliver on 48 hours' notice an additional 3000 varieties of whiskey drawn from its online offerings. With around 4,000 different varieties of whiskey, the majority of them Scotch, it can also claim to be the Internet's largest purveyor of whiskey in general and of Scotch in particular.The original The Whiskey Exchange was opened in 1999, as an Internet based retailer of whiskies and fine spirits. Once the company was established it opened its first store in 2005, in the Vinopolis wine complex near London Bridge. Founded in 1999, the Vinopolis facility was part a wine inspired theme park and part a wine and spirits focused shopping center. The complex offered visitors ""virtual tours"" of all of the world's major wine regions as well as master classes in tasting and wine appreciation. It also hosted a restaurant, several wine bars, as well as retail shops specializing in wines and spirits. The venue was also used to showcase wines that had medaled at the Decanter World Wine Awards. The retail store quickly became a fixture in London's retail whiskey scene, as well as a favorite stopover for TWE's worldwide customers. The store was recognized as Independent Spirits Retailer of the Year at the Drinks Retailing Awards in 2009, 2010 and 2011. In 2014, Whisky Magazine chose it as Overall Whiskey Retailer of the Year, as part of the magazine's Icons of Whiskey Award. The company had always intended to open a second, larger store near Covent Garden, but the new store became a necessity when the owners of Vinopolis, where the previous store was located, sold the retail complex in 2015. TWE has already announced that it is looking for a new site for a second store in the London Bridge area. The TWE's current whiskey selection of 1000 different expressions, most of which are single malt Scotches, will increase to around 1,200 expressions by the end of 2016. The store intends to start stocking the complete collection of Macallan Fine and Rare vintages and the Glenfarclas's Family Cask offerings, as well as an expanded range of what Events Manager Andrew Milne describes as ""very rare premium whiskies"" from other distilleries. The Macallan Fine and Rare Vintage Collection Among some of the ""rare"" expressions currently offered are a selection of two-dozen 50-year-old whiskies ranging from a 1919 Springbank, one of only 17 bottled in 1970, and available for a cool $72,000, to a Gordon and MacPhail 1966 Banff that was bottled in 2015, and is a relative bargain at $1,100. Order it via mail order and avoid the value added tax and it can be yours for only $925. Since the Banff distillery has been closed for more than three decades, this bottling is truly one of a kind. The Macallan selections will be housed in a special Macallan Room downstairs from the main floor. If the store is Scotch whisky's cathedral, then I suppose this room would be the Macallan chapel. I wonder if they will make it available for weddings? The company also offers a broad selection of limited release bottlings. Most of these are single cask offerings from specialty bottlers like Signatory and Gordon & MacPhail, but also include special bottlings, which are exclusive to TWE. Some of the specialty bottlings are only offered in the retail store in order to differentiate its selection from the online offerings. One more reason to visit the store if you are ever in London, although TWE's legions of online fans need little incentive to drop by the store should they find themselves in the city. Among the company's most requested categories are Japanese whiskies and American bourbon. The former category still has supply issues according to Milne. Limited edition bottlings of bourbon are also showing consistent strength. Scotch whiskey is still TWE's most significant market segment, however, and remains hugely popular among the company's customers. American customers make up the company's largest Internet customer segment and Canada is, from a percentage standpoint, one of its fastest growing markets as, too, is Asia. Rare and limited editions continue to attract strong demand from the United States and northern Europe, according to Milne, while anything with the Macallan name continues to find keen interest among Asian Scotch enthusiasts. TWE's customers are predominantly male, typically between the ages of 35 to 65. Although the company does a majority of its sales online, its Internet sales are also an important driver of traffic in its retail store. The Whiskey Exchange's 40 liter cask program.  TWE offers a custom filling in its store from a selection of 40 liter cask barrels. The instore fill program features a blended rum, a blended cognac, and a choice from an ever changing selection of blended single malts from Scotland's various regions. Currently, the Scotch selection features a nine-year-old (YO) Covent Garden Select Reserve Blended Malt drawn from throughout Scotland's whisky producing regions, a nine YO Covent Garden Peated Reserve blend and a 14 YO Covent Garden Sherry Cask Reserve blend. The instore cask program is extremely popular with customers as each blend is unique and is rarely repeated. It typically takes around a month to cycle through a particular cask, although popular offerings can sell out within a matter of days. To comply with current Scotch Whisky Association rules, the casks now need to be lined with an inert material. In addition to its broad whiskey selection, TWE also has a growing specialty in rums. The company was able to secure the last ever consignment of official Royal Navy rum. This batch was released in 2011 and there are still a few bottles available. It was packaged as ""Black Tot,"" to commemorate the last serving of rum aboard Royal Navy ships at precisely 6 bells in the forenoon watch (11 a.m. to you land lubbers). The occasion was dubbed Black Tot Day by die hard traditionalists. It ended a 300-year-old Royal Navy tradition. A 1919 Springbank bottled in 1970 TWE also directly imports high end Zafra rum from Panama. Starting in 2017, the company also plans to launch a series of exclusive rum bottlings. According to Milne, ""rum is one of the first brown spirits people drink so it is a great stepping stone for getting people into whiskey."" The store holds regular rum tastings and recently featured tastings with Alexandre Gabriel from Plantation Rum, as well as with noted Barbados rum producer Richard Seale. The Whiskey Exchange is one of London's most iconic whiskey merchants. With the largest selection of whiskies in the planet, technically one could say in the universe, it is a not to be missed stop on any whiskey enthusiast's London itinerary."

But you probably don't think about workplace safety much.

But you probably don't think about workplace safety much. Most of us show up to work each day and we take it for granted that we will return home safely. Sadly, that is not always the case. The reality is someone is hurt at work every 7 seconds, and each one of these injuries is preventable. Whether you work in an office, on a construction site or behind the wheel of a truck, safety should be an important part of every workday.The National Safety Council asked average American workers what they thought about safety in their workplace. What we found is concerning: One third of U.S. workers surveyed said their employers prioritize productivity over safety. While it seems like ""doing more with less"" is the norm these days, it should not come at the cost of safety - especially when workplace deaths and injuries are completely preventable.Listening to workers Our survey found that 62% of construction workers and those in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting - all high-risk industries - believe management does only the minimum required by law to keep employees safe. The survey respondents are relying on their employers to provide safe systems. At the National Safety Council, we know the organizations that take safety seriously - in any industry, not just those that are dangerous - have committed leadership and engage their employees.  One of my former colleagues used to say, ""You sweep the stairs from the top,"" and I always found this to be a helpful visual. If everyone in the organization is to commit to safety, it starts with a CEO communicating a safety vision for the organization, leading by example and conveying that safety is a shared responsibility. Safety training and resources must be provided to workers to ensure they are equipped to work safely.And employees should always be empowered to speak up if unsafe conditions exist. Another sobering finding from our survey was that more than 40% of workers in high-risk environments - transportation, construction and the healthcare sector - were afraid to report safety issues. While fear of reporting problems can stem from multiple factors, everyone in the organization, their customers and the public is at risk if employees are worried about losing their job if they raise a safety concern.  How does your workplace compare?Take a step back and evaluate your own workplace. Are there things that can be improved to make you feel safer? If your employer is not communicating with you about safety on a regular basis, are there safety topics you and your co-workers could bring up for discussion?If you want to know about the biggest risks you face on and off the job, take advantage of our Safety Checkup tool to receive a snapshot of your personal risks based on your age, gender, occupation and where you live.At NSC, our vision is to eliminate preventable deaths in our lifetime, but we can only do that if everyone prioritizes safety. Employers play an important role in creating safe systems, providing training, and evaluating and addressing risks. You can play an important role in advancing safety at any level in an organization. Always be on the lookout for dangers, and remember that your personal safety comes first. There is no project or deadline worth risking your life."

Unlike many other Iranian-Americans, I lived, studied, and grew up most of life in Iran, including under the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and leadership of the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. I believe that I gained on the ground, first-hand experience, and witnessed how the political establishment of Iran functions and how the Islamic Republic has its claws in every sector of the society. It worth noting that one revolutionary value -- the anti-Americanism (death to the Great Satan) -- is the very existence, raison d'être, and legitimacy of the political establishment, particularly the top gilded circle of Iranian leaders. Whatever one attempts to do, whatever policy a government pursues, and whatever any U.S. administration attempts to do, one can not change this underlying ideological and revolutionary pillar of the system. Why? Because If you take this revolutionary value (anti-Americanism) away from the Islamic Republic of Iran, the system will crumble like a house of sand. That is why whenever leaders think that the U.S. and Iran are getting closer, Iranian top gilded leaders reassert the message that America is the enemy number one: The ""Great Satan."" Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Tehran's message has been consistent that the Islamic Republic faces existential threats and enemies. We were taught from an early age, through the educational system and books, about the dangerous ""America."" The state's media outlets persistently repeats why one should continue saying ""death to America,"" and blames America for every socio-economic and geopolitical problem Iran has.Having this powerful ""enemy"" serves very well as a social, political, strategic and economic scapegoat for Iranian leaders as well. Without ""the Great Satan, the enemy"" how can the Iranian leaders justify cracking down on opposition? Without the existential ""the Great Satan, the enemy"", how can Khamenei and the IRGC explain the large military budget? If there is no ""the Great Satan, the enemy"", how will Iranian leaders take attention away from the day-to-day difficulties that Iranians face? Without the ""the Great Satan, the enemy"", how can Iranian leaders distract attention from the accumulation of wealth at the top and the large amount of poverty in Iran? Without the ""the Great Satan, the enemy"", from which social base would Khamenei obtain his legitimacy? Having the powerful ""Great Satan, the enemy"" is also a method to rule by invoking nationalistic sentiments through instigating hatred and fear.

Now the games have begun! Directed by Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles, known for City of God and supporter of the World Bank Group's Connect4Climate program, the opening ceremony put climate change front and center.Overall the ceremony was a dazzling spectacle, at the fraction of the cost of previous Olympic opening, celebrating Brazilian culture and unity. Creative use of projections, Gisele Bündchen, a team of refugees, thousands of saplings, 12-year-old rapper MC Soffia teamed up to lifted the Olympic spirit.But what stayed with me the most was the strong message for climate action: ""The heat is melting the ice cap,"" a voice said. ""It's disappearing very quickly."" The climate segment showed effects of the melting polar ice cap and subsequent rising sea level on places that include Amsterdam, Dubai, Lagos, Shanghai, Florida and Rio de Janeiro itself. A green peace sign shone in the middle of Maracana Stadium. Each of the 12,000 athletes were given a seedling to plant in Rio to form an Athlete's Forest with 208 species, one for each competing delegation.Meirelles explained the climate message: ""Climate change and the depletion of natural resources need our attention and the Olympics Opening Ceremony is a wonderful opportunity to shed light on this subject. Brazil, with the largest tropical reserve of biodiversity on the planet, is the right place for this message to be spread.""Campaigning for climate actionOver two weeks, as athletes hoped to smash records, many lent their voices to a campaign to limit global warming to 1.5C, the critical threshold for those on the front line of climate impacts. The ""1.5C: The Record We Must Not Break"" campaign is supported by the Sport4Climate initiative of the World Bank Group's Connect4Climate Program.The campaign was officially launched on July 28 at the ""Climate Change: What does the Olympics have to do with it?"" symposium in Rio de Janeiro. Hosted by the Museu do Amanhã, with the Rio Olympics Organizing Committee Sustainability Unit and the Climate Observatory, the symposium featured engaging statements calling for ambitious climate action. Martin Raiser, World Bank Country Director for Brazil, emphasized the intimate link between ending poverty and tackling climate change during the opening panel: ""Our own research shows us that without concerted action, climate change could push 100 million more people into poverty by 2030.""Mr. Raiser's contribution was well received by the Brazilian Minister of Environment, José Sarney Filho, and other symposium participants. The Minister reiterated Brazil's commitment to sustainable development: ""We will transition with safety and determination to a low-carbon future that will not cost our economy...In our fight against climate change we have no choice but to win, let's be inspired by our athletes.""I joined the panel on the ""Paris Agreement, 1.5°C to stay alive"" presenting the Sport4Climate initiative of the World Bank's climate change communication program, Connect4Climate. I emphasized the opportunity for young people to engage in the rapid transition to a low-carbon resilient future. Climate education is key for today's youth to implement and advance climate solutions, and communication helps build the social currency for strong political commitments.The symposium presented the decarbonizing plan for the Rio Olympics and in closing the symposium our Sport4Climate Champion, pro-surfer Marina Werneck, launched the ""1.5°C: The Record We Must Not Break"" campaign. From stage she encouraged all to ""ride the good wave,"" support ambitious climate action, and not break the global warming record beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius.In closing the campaign video, which now has spread across the web, was unveiled: ""Humanity has always overcome its limits. Broken records. Because of Human activity the average temperature on Earth increased by 1°C in the last century. If it increases by more than 1.5°C some countries will be flooded, others will become sicker, hotter or drier. Is it right to steal the future of millions of people? 1.5 degrees is the record we must not break.""  Stop breaking climate recordsThe location and timing for the climate message at the Rio Olympics is right. Brazil, with its natural beauty, abundant biodiversity and the importance of the Amazon in regulating climate change, can lead the charge on climate awareness. Historical events leading up to the games have certainly also set the stage.In 2015 the world came together with the announcement of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. More than 170 countries then signed the agreement at the United Nations on Earth Day in April 2016, a record-setting signing event. 2015 was also a record year in terms of heat, sea level rise and extreme weather, as confirmed by the ""State of the Climate"" report, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) with input from hundreds of scientists from 62 countries. ""The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,"" Michael Mann, a leading climatologist at Penn State, told the Guardian. ""They are playing out before us, in real time. The 2015 numbers drive that home.""While climate impacts are being felt around the world, the momentum for climate action is certainly there. With the Olympics calling for ambitious climate action, now is the time to solve this generation's crisis.Athletes are showing their support for ambitious climate action. Competitors from the Marshall Islands, Afghanistan and South Sudan - countries on the front line of climate impacts - are leading the charge. Brazilian surfers, footballers and water polo players have also lent their voices. More than 100 athletes told the world that 1.5°C is the record we must not break."

Always. Before Clinton and Trump, there was Reagan, Bill, Bush, and Obama. Because shaking hands with a hardhat is always a good photo opportunity for an elected official.The love these workers get is well-deserved. America's manufacturing workforce play an outsized role in our economy. Even though they represent just 11 percent of the U.S. workforce, they produce most of our exports; their engineers and scientists perform roughly two-thirds of private-sector R&D and they produce 90 percent of new patents. They support more jobs in the community than any major service sector occupation. And they tend to pay better wages than non-college educated peers in other occupations, which means that they spread more money around local stores. These workers deserve more than lip service. They deserve economic opportunity, and they deserve respect. What should that mean for politicians? Practice what you preach. If you say you love American manufacturing and also put your name on a product, make sure it's made by American workers. If you say you love American workers, don't blame them for our problems. And don't say they aren't skilled enough, because workforce training is a shared responsibility. Look forward, and not backwards. Don't spend all of your time acting stymied by increasing automation and global competition; they're facts on the ground, and they're nothing new. You want to see countries with walls? Look at North Korea, and you'll get a taste. Here's what we really need to figure out: How do we capture more of the global economic pie on behalf of American workers, and how do we shape the rules so that we have a level playing field? Current efforts to shape that playing field seem to be misguided. And it's not enough to just say ""no"" to trade. Finally, more politicians would do well to acknowledge all workers, around the world, should be treated with dignity and respect. Chinese and Mexican workers aren't responsible for American job loss. Policies set by governments and corporate decision-making play a far larger role. Workers aren't only the often unacknowledged foundation of our economy, they're what makes democracy everywhere vibrant. It's time to respect and work for them; not just on Labor Day."

LIVE on June 29, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/BET/Getty Images for BET)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bada5203c000066000b3f24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday morning I awakened and checked my Twitter feed. Immediately my eyes were drawn to the statement issued by Gabrielle Union on Nate Parker and his rape allegations. Reading through her op-ed, I found myself like, her, in a ""state of stomach churning confusion."" Like Gabrielle, I am a survivor of sexual violence. On two occasions, I was drunk and unable to give consent. Like Union and Parker's victim, the only witnesses were me and my assailant(s). As I write these words, I am mindful of the terrible position that Union has been placed in as a star of the forthcoming film, Birth of a Nation. As a fellow survivor, I respect the courage that it takes for any survivor to speak out against sexual assault. And while I agree with Union's stance that there needs to be more discussion on what exactly constitutes ""affirmative consent,"" I find myself troubled by her opinion piece and the way in which it is being used by rape apologists to deflect attention away from Nate Parker's actions 17 years ago and onto more neutral territory - society's pervasive problem with rape culture. When I see men and women who have been rabidly defending Parker based upon the fact of his acquittal avidly retweeting her statement, you know there is some form of misdirection occurring. Equally disturbing is how the media has taken one sentence from Union's article and used it to inaccurately frame the content and intent of her op-ed. Repeatedly, the lead in sentence on social media has been, ""As important and ground-breaking as this film is, I cannot take these allegations lightly."" This is clickbait at its finest - for it implies that Union has taken a stand on Nate Parker himself when in fact her article is really a stance on rape culture as a whole. Parker continues to enlist the protection of women to shield him from the social ramifications of his actions. By stating he is married - he implies he is not a rapist. By stating he is the father of daughters, he is stating he is not a rapist. By bringing his daughter to a press conference, he used her visage to buoy his family man image. By having a prominent Black actress who is a survivor of sexual violence write an op-ed that benefits him and the film, he is being protected from having to face the consequences of his actions that were a contributing factor in the death of a young woman.   ""Parker continues to enlist the protection of women to shield him from the social ramifications of his actions.""  As I read her article, Union managed to simultaneously indict society for its tolerance of rape culture while giving Parker a pass. She writes, ""On that night, 17-odd years ago, did Nate have his date's consent? It's very possible he thought he did. Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if she never said ""no,"" silence certainly does not equal ""yes."" Although it's often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a ""no"" as a ""yes"" is problematic at least, criminal at worst."" She continues, ""Regardless of what I think may have happened that night 17 years ago, after reading all 700 pages of the trial transcript, I still don't actually know. Nor does anyone who was not in that room."" By retreating to the well-worn, ""well, we weren't there, so we don't know what really happened"" statement, Union utilized a common tactic used to perpetuate rape culture. However, she also acknowledges between the lines of her statement that in fact Parker did rape his victim because he did not have his victim's consent - since a woman or man incapacitated by alcohol or drugs cannot give consent. In her paragraph outlining the various types of survivors who remain silent about the crimes committed against us, Union essentially asks that we focus our attention on the victims of sexual assault - not the perpetrators. But true change can only occur when both are addressed. Parker has of yet to make any sort of definitive statement acknowledging that he raped his victim, outside of an EBONY interview that focused largely on his lack of knowledge of what consent meant while in college and his male privilege. Contrary to what Parker stated, sexual consent has been a topic on college campuses well before 1999. With expert subtlety, Union redirects the conversation away from Parker's actions by stating that we should instead use the film as an opportunity to discuss consent and challenge rape culture. Union states, ""I believe that the film is an opportunity to inform and educate so that these situations cease to occur on college campuses, in dorm rooms, in fraternities, in apartments or anywhere else young people get together to socialize."" I disagree. In fact, I would argue that every survivor that has had their voice silenced will see Parker's face up on that screen and be re-traumatized. In the gang rape scene, they will see their powerlessness and the complicity of a patriarchal society. His presence, on film and in person, is a reminder that sexual violence is less important than box office receipts. It is a reminder that if you have privilege - whether as an elite college wrestler or a Hollywood director and actor - that people will find a million ways to justify the right for a rapist to tell their story and live free from any sort of long-standing consequences. In this case, Nate Parker and Jean Celestin, his co-writer on the film, will never have to hear the dissenting voice of their accuser today. They are alive and legally - not morally - exonerated while their victim is dead.   ""If a rapist manages to skate a conviction based on a technicality, society will hold you accountable instead.""  One does not need to see the film in order to learn more about rape culture. One does not have to watch Birth of a Nation in order to learn more about affirmative consent. In fact, I would argue that by NOT watching the film, one is taking a more assertive stance against acts of ""non-affirmative consent."" We can do better. Union can do better. One can choose to hold Parker accountable (such as opting not to see the film) and challenge rape culture. They are not mutually exclusive. In fact, I argue that by doing both, society is sending an even larger message against the very system of male privilege, entitlement, and toxic masculinity that Union and Parker state we should be taking a stand against. By not seeing Birth of a Nation, the message will be sent that if a rapist manages to skate a conviction based on a technicality, that society will hold you accountable instead.Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-656-HOPE for the National Sexual Assault Hotline."

Trump is calling his surprise visit to Mexico City Wednesday a 'great honor.' The Republican presidential nominee said after meeting with PeÃ±a Nieto that the pair had a substantive, direct and constructive exchange of ideas.(AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb828dc3c000018010dbf96.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump going to Mexico could have had a certain ""Nixon goes to China"" flavor about it, and he actually was getting some good reviews for crossing the very low bar of ""not totally embarrassing himself or his country"" -- at least for the first few hours. Then he went to Phoenix, and Mr. Hyde came back out.Trump gave what was billed as a major speech on immigration, which turned out to be exactly what he'd been saying all along on the subject. The big difference? It was in (gasp!) a numbered list read off a TelePrompTer. As for the policies, there wasn't much difference at all from what he's been saying throughout the campaign so far.Deportation force? Check! [Trump called it a ""deportation task force"" which was about the only real change.] Big, beautiful wall? Check! [It will now have magic tunnel sensors!] Mexico pays for the wall? Yep! [""They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it.""] Deportation for all? Oh, you bet! [Only change seems to be that some will have to wait a little longer to be deported.] Dreamer kids? Deport 'em all! Two million ""criminal aliens"" deported in the first hour he's in office? Count on it! Softening? Pivot? Nope! [Fooled ya again, suckers!]No word on whether Trump enjoyed a taco bowl at any point during his big Mexico/immigration day. The fallout from his hardliner speech in Phoenix was swift, as several of the ""Latino advisors"" Trump had recently met with quit the effort in disgust and publicly renounced their support for Trump's campaign. So, it looks like that whole minority outreach thing is going swimmingly, folks!Tomorrow, Trump is apparently planning the same sort of minority outreach to African-Americans. That should be interesting, to put it mildly.If it even happens, that is. The negotiations for this visit have been pretty convoluted, so far. Ben Carson was apparently the instigator of this trip, designed to introduce Donald Trump to some actual African-Americans in Detroit (where Carson grew up). Not a bad idea, on the face of it. But the Trump campaign is about as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs about what could happen.At first, Trump was supposed to address the congregation at a Great Faith Ministries International service. This was then changed to just an interview with the pastor, held in private, to be broadcast publicly a week later. Just to be certain there wouldn't be any surprises, the Trump campaign demanded all questions be submitted in advance, in writing. Then Team Trump carefully wrote out answers for Trump to parrot back. No word on whether a TelePrompTer would be allowed, or if Trump would be allowed to just read from prepared notes. And the icing on the cake: Trump's campaign would be allowed to edit the interview after it happened, ""so that the final version reflected the campaign's wishes."" You can see what we mean about that cat nervously eying all the rocking chairs, right?The New York Times helpfully provided excerpts from the prepared answers Trump was supposed to read. Most of it is commonplace progressive-bashing Republican boilerplate, with faint overtones of racial condescension: ""If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential."" The most amusing part of the script was the answer Trump's handlers prepared for the first question: ""Are you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?""As I went through my life, things got busy with business, but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of God. I treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful God.Translation: ""My family's religious! Didn't you see my wonderful kids at the convention? All their religious faith has got to have rubbed off on me a little bit, right?"" You've got to love that last term: ""an ever-wonderful God,"" which was obviously included in a pathetic attempt to make all of this sound like something Trump would spontaneously say. Now that the prepared script has been leaked, it will be interesting to see how far Trump actually strays from the words he's been told to say, that's for sure.Trump's campaign did go into some frenetic damage control after the New York Times exposed all their careful preparation. They now say they will refrain from editing the interview themselves (awfully big of them, don't you think?). They also have promised that Trump will actually speak to more than just one person, and ""would indeed address the congregation for a few minutes and would spend a half-hour casually speaking with church members individually."" So it looks like there will still be plenty of room for a few monstrous gaffes after all....At the very least, though, Donald Trump is putting himself out there. Hillary Clinton seems to have largely disappeared in the meantime, which has coincided with a noticeable drop in the polls for her. She's still beating Trump, mind you, just by a thinner margin. But the trendline should be worrisome for Democrats. Hillary has slipped a point or two from the bounce she got after the Democratic National Convention, but is still in relatively healthy shape. Donald Trump hasn't really benefited much from this slip, as most of the restless voters have moved instead to third-party candidates. This is also a worrisome trend, since up until now the Libertarian and Green candidates seem to have drained votes from both major candidates in equal proportion. Hillary Clinton is doing a much better job than Trump of running ads and setting up her ground game, but it is time for her to stop appearing only in front of well-heeled donors and return to campaigning in earnest. Especially after the F.B.I. released another document dump on the subject of her email server today.In other amusing news from the Republican campaign trail (down-ballot), John McCain and Marco Rubio handily won their respective GOP primaries this Tuesday. McCain wasted no time in running very quickly away from Donald Trump afterwards, releasing a web video where he warns of the dangers of the upcoming Hillary Clinton presidency.It was revealed this week that Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, also running for re-election, would cut his own children off from receiving their inheritance if they committed more than one felony, or had (or sired) more than one child out of wedlock. Nothing like family values, eh? I mean, it's not like Republicans are usually big fans of providing incentives for family members to get abortions or anything, right?What else... Sarah Palin did a face-plant it on a rock-running trail, causing herself a head injury. From what she posted afterwards, it's really kind of hard to tell the difference between Palin ranting with a concussion and all of Palin's previous mangling of the English language. Oh, and Iowa Republicans running for Senate all seem to be using exactly the same kids in all their campaign ads. That should be interesting, when their television ads run right after each other!And finally, we conclude this introductory section with a plug for an election information site that caught our eye. It's called ""ProCon"" and it lists in detail all the candidates' positions on all kinds of specific issues. Complete with quotes and history, it is a valuable resource to compare all the presidential candidates (even some from primary season who didn't make the cut) on whatever issue matters most to you. So check it out!Three Democrats were mildly impressive this week: Debbie Wasserman Schultz won the primary for her House seat, Joe Biden compassionately dealt with a heckler at a campaign speech, and Hillary Clinton actually reacted quickly to a news story and introduced a new policy idea to combat rampant greed and price-gouging among drug companies with monopolies on common medications. That last one, in particular, is worth at least an Honorable Mention because it showed leadership and showed Team Clinton could react quicker than they usually do to a big news story. Is her plan workable? Hard to tell, but it's notable for being just about the only plan out there to directly attack companies who jack up the price of medication by hundreds of percent just because they can.But this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award goes to President Obama, for setting a record that will forever be part of his legacy. Last week, Obama commuted the sentences of 111 offenders, some of them serving life in prison for heinous crimes such as selling LSD at a Grateful Dead show. Obama is using the power of the pen to bring relief to people who were sentenced at the height of the ""mandatory minimum"" Drug War craze -- people who would get far less punishment for the same crimes today.Obama's total for August alone was 325 commutations -- the most of any U.S. president in a single month, ever. His overall record is equally impressive, now standing at 673 commutations, which is more than the previous 10 presidents combined.With Obama entering his final months in office, we can probably expect to see hundreds more federal prisoners obtain either commutations of their sentences or outright pardons. This is normal for the end of any president's term, in fact (although Obama's numbers are a lot higher).Now, even 673 commutations is nowhere near enough. Tens of thousands of people were sentenced under Draconian drug laws in the 1990s and 2000s who should also have a chance to be freed or fully pardoned. But Obama has made great strides towards dismantling the worst excesses of the era, as the Drug War slowly winds down after roughly a century of political exploitation.For doing what he can -- more than any previous president in a single month, in fact -- President Obama has certainly earned another Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award.[Congratulate President Barack Obama via the White House contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]To use a baseball metaphor, Anthony Weiner just got his third strike and is now out -- of his marriage.Yes, our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week is none other than ""Carlos Danger"" himself, Anthony ""Let Me Show You My"" Weiner.Weiner's first foray into getting publicly caught sexting pictures of his... um... last name, to women he was not actually married to, cost him his House seat. His second public humiliation for doing exactly the same stupid thing cost him any slim chance he might have had at becoming mayor of New York City.His third boneheaded sexting adventure is already proving to be the costliest one for Weiner yet, as it has already cost him his marriage (to Hillary Clinton's closest advisor), and put him under investigation from the local child welfare agency. This was because he actually (shudder) sent one of his sexts to yet another woman who was not actually his wife, which included his young son on the bed with him.That's really about all that needs to be said about that. Hopefully, three strikes means he will forever be out of the public eye, and we'll never have to give him another MDDOTW award ever again. Hopefully, at any rate.For being a serial peter-tweeter, Anthony Weiner is easily (we were going to say ""hands down"" but then we reconsidered that imagery) this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. Three strikes, you're out... as Carlos Danger rides sadly off into the sunset.[Anthony Weiner is actually a private citizen, and our blanket policy is not to provide contact information for such persons.]Volume 406 (9/2/16)Today's talking points have a theme. The theme is: ""When reaching out to minority voters, it's best if you don't then smack them in the face."" Three of these come straight from prominent Latinos who previously (right up until he gave his Phoenix speech) supported Donald Trump. The first two deal with Trump's much-ballyhooed African-American outreach. As always, enjoy and use these talking points responsibly (heh). Not funny at allIt is 2016, but apparently some people's sense of humor is stuck in about the 1950s, it seems.""I see the Trump campaign's outreach to minority voters is going about as well as anyone really should have expected. While much attention was paid to Trump's speech about immigration, Team Trump was also out there trying to woo the African-American vote. By tweeting a cartoon depicting Hillary Clinton in blackface. No really -- that's their idea of what constitutes acceptable humor in this day and age. And I guess that's their idea of how to reach out to minority voters, too. Seems more like a smack in the face than any definition of 'outreach' I've seen."" What is Trump scared of?This one is just too, too funny.""Donald Trump is heading to the wilderness known as 'Detroit,' but don't worry, he'll have Ben Carson there to explain stuff to him. Trump will also grant an interview to a second actual African-American, a pastor at a church there. But it seems Team Trump is absolutely terrified by the prospect. First they decided that Trump wouldn't actually be speaking to the congregation. Then they demanded that all the questions be submitted in advance. The original plan was also that 'aides would... edit the taped interview so that the final version reflected the campaign's wishes.' Even that wasn't enough cotton padding, they also decided to write out Trump's answers in advance, in the hopes that he wouldn't say something outrageous. When this all was exposed by the media, Trump's campaign quickly backtracked and said they wouldn't actually be editing the interview themselves, and that Trump will speak for 'at least 10 minutes' to the congregation. Gee, I wonder why they're worried? Donald Trump speaking in front of the biggest African-American audience he's ever faced, about his supposed deep religious feelings? What could possibly go wrong?"" Beautiful outreachTrump apparently has his own convenient place to shop for new wives. No surprise, really.""Donald Trump, among his other business enterprises, runs Trump Model Management, an agency for foreign models to work through in New York. But to listen to actual models who used to work for Trump's agency, the place was nothing more than a multi-layered scam. The biggest revelation was, according to more than one model, that Trump was 'bringing in all of these girls from all over the world and they're working illegally.' No work permits were ever even applied for, and the models were told precisely how to lie to immigration agents when entering the country. I guess it's not all that surprising that Trump would completely ignore immigration law to his own profit, since we're still waiting to find out exactly how his current wife entered the country. What she described, in fact, was precisely what a model in New York would have to do to fool the immigration folks by working here on a tourist visa, stating: 'Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa.' Trump promised there'd be a press conference to explain Melania's immigration history, but I'm not exactly holding my breath waiting for that to happen. If Trump were truly serious about cracking down on employers for immigration violations, he'd have to start with his own company, and what are the chances of that happening?"" A big fightThese next three are all from prominent Latinos who used to support Trump but now can't anymore (from two separate articles about Latinos fleeing the Trump campaign). The first is from ""leading Latino conservative"" and ""prominent surrogate for Trump"" Alfonso Aguilar, on hoping for a Trump pivot, and on why he can no longer support Trump:Last week, you could tell, there was the real possibility of a pivot. I think there was a big fight within the campaign, and I think the restrictionist forces won. No time for being scammedThe next two are from former members of Trump's ""National Hispanic Advisory Council"" who can no longer live with supporting Trump (there are others who have fled the council, it's worth mentioning, but due to space limitations we're only going to quote two of them). The first is from Ramiro Pena, a pastor at Waco's Christ the King Church.I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight. The ""National Hispanic Advisory Council"" seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam. Coming soon -- Trump TV?Texas lawyer Jacob Monty was telling anyone who would listen what his reaction to the speech was, as he also exited Trump's Latino outreach council.The speech was just an utter disappointment. We were out there defending him. And then to be just lied to like that -- it doesn't feel good. It's not okay. Foul play?This last one comes from David Kochel, former campaign strategist for Jeb Bush, on the subject of who exactly Trump's speech was supposed to impress.It has to be [the Trump campaign's] calculation that they can drive up turnout in white working-class areas of battleground states to dizzying heights. Otherwise this move makes no sense 69 days from the election. The ""softening"" of Trump's immigration policy died tragically on Wednesday night in Phoenix.

43,POLITICS,Democrats Turn To Supreme Court To Save 'Golden Week' Of Early Voting,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-ohio-voting-golden-week_us_57c892bee4b0e60d31de46be,Ohio's black voters embraced this option in the last two elections.,2016-09-02,The Ohio legislature voted to end Golden Week despite its popularity with African-American voters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c8cd42180000b429bcec1a.jpeg?cache=r2wRxz7hgg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A coalition of Ohio Democratic groups asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to put the brakes on an appeals court ruling last week that could make it harder for black voters to cast ballots this year.The Democrats are trying to restore “Golden Week,” a six-day early voting period in which Ohioans could both register and vote in person on the same day. It was an option disproportionately used by African-Americans.In a petition addressed to Justice Elena Kagan, who handles emergency requests from federal courts in Ohio, the Democratic groups argued that losing Golden Week would cause minority voters “irreparable harm.”“This period has played an exceptional, historic role in promoting voter registration and turnout in the past two Presidential elections, especially in minority communities,” the coalition said in its filing.In 2014, Ohio legislators eliminated Golden Week but otherwise left in place 29 days of early voting either in person or via absentee ballot. That set off a firestorm of litigation alleging discrimination against minority voters.The legal challenges didn’t stop the law from taking effect for the 2014 election, but this May a federal judge concluded that the cutback on combined same-day registration and early voting clearly fell hardest on black voters.“African Americans will disproportionately bear this burden, because … they have greater time and resource limitations that may prevent them from waiting in line on Election Day and are less likely to vote absentee,” said U.S. District Judge Michael Watson in a ruling that found the rollbacks unconstitutional.But last week, a divided federal appeals court reversed that decision, noting that Ohio remained a “national leader” in the realm of early voting and that the 29 days it offers ahead of Election Day are “really quite generous.” (At the other end of the spectrum, states like New York and Pennsylvania offer no days of early voting.)Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R), who is named as a defendant in this litigation, is expected to oppose the Democrats’ petition before the Supreme Court. On Thursday, he announced a voter education campaign aimed at promoting absentee voting in the lead-up to Nov. 8.Given the Supreme Court’s current composition ― evenly divided between liberal and conservative justices ― it is possible there might not be a majority of five to grant the Ohio Democrats’ request. On Wednesday, the high court denied a request from North Carolina to restore a set of voting restrictions that another appeals court had held discriminated against African-Americans. The justices split 4-to-4.A ruling in Thursday’s petition, which Kagan is likely to refer to the whole court, could come next week."
