Elite French police stormed a printworks and a Jewish supermarket Friday, killing two brothers wanted for the Charlie Hebdo attack and a gunman linked to them in a dramatic end to twin sieges that rocked France. The dramatic climax to the two standoffs brought to an end more than 48 hours of fear and uncertainty that began when the two brothers slaughtered 12 people at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in the bloodiest attack on French soil in half a century. AFP PHOTO / JUSTIN TALLIS (Photo credit should read JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e3ae260000350083beaf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the wake of the brutal killings of the satirists of French weekly Charlie Hebdo, the people of the Internet are having a national -- actually, I guess it's an international -- conversation on the role of satire, the importance of free speech and the need to defend free expression, no matter how objectionable that expression might be. One unique thing that's emerged in the past few days is a sudden outpouring of affection and support for people who regularly pursue the dissemination of cross-the-line content and repugnant ideas. This shock to our sensibilities, doled out so cruelly by terrorists, has resulted in a new environment where all of us are encouraged -- if not urged! -- to take to our content management systems and go for broke in the act of ruthlessly producing content that ruffles feathers, impales our sacred cows, offends widely, and leaves no target immune from our LULZ. And to do so wantonly.Slate's Jacob Weisberg put it like so: ""The best response to the Charlie Hebdo attack -- other than catching and punishing killers -- is to escalate blasphemous satire."" His call has been echoed by others. The New York Times Ross Douthat urged, ""The right to blaspheme (and otherwise give offense) is essential to the liberal order."" New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait let it be known that ""one cannot defend the right [to blaspheme] without defending the practice.""Of course, as of this writing, none of these defenders of blasphemy have actually chosen to offer up any blasphemy themselves. I guess that was meant to be someone else's job? Oh, well: challenge made ... challenge accepted, by First Look Media's Glenn Greenwald, who today has published a raft of virulently anti-Semitic cartoons. He didn't ask for anyone's permission, folks ... he just ""went there."" It's a brand new day in terms of free expression. We're blowing past boundaries. We're pushing envelopes. We're monetizing content that normally would curdle the souls of our readers and advertisers. But not everyone is excited about this new world. Earlier this week, Rusty Foster of ""Today In Tabs"" wondered if we maybe shouldn't try to ""chart a course in between 'cause maximum offense at all times' and 'murder people for cartoons.'"" Well, nuts to that. The Thought Leaders are urging us to dispense with the labor-intensive activity of probing our own work in deference to the considerations of others, because this is a war on all of us, and it needs to be won by, say, close of business Friday, Pacific Time. And I want in.So, having been called to this duty, I am now going to republish some of the most vile and objectionable content available on the Internet, in this forum. I will warn you up front that this is going to be brutal and offensive material -- stuff that only a ragtag fringe of leprotic minds would cheer to see disseminated. Nevertheless, it must be done, and I'm not going to apologize for the hurt that this is about to cause many of you.This video's content launched the world on a path of ruination with which we're still grappling.Simply stated: a pure distillation of unrelenting hate.There are fewer things in this world more disgusting in nature than what's depicted above.The ideas contained herein have been thoroughly denounced, discredited and defamed. Look upon them again ... if you can take it.Much like ISIS was deemed by al Qaeda to be horrifying, this video's contents even seared the souls of this world's most flaboyant hate-merchants.I'll admit it. This is where I wavered. This is where I thought I might be going too far. But I screwed my courage to the sticking point.When the world first saw this, we all found it so easy to say, ""Not in MY name!"" And yet when you think about it, we are ALL responsible for this.I know. you'd rather not live in the same world as this. Consider it my bitter reminder that you don't get a pass.There you have it. Now, some of you scolds might still have the temerity to ask me, ""What was the point of this?"" The first thing I'll tell all you politically correct pukes is that you just don't get it, man. We're well past the point where the need to account for a ""point"" is required. But if you must know, I'll say simply this: If it's really our conviction that there's nothing and no one who is so sacred that it is beyond the bounds of lampoon, then -- in the truest spirit of Charlie Hebdo (""...its creators would be dumbfounded to find themselves memorialized,"" writes Arthur Goldhammer) -- the most courageous act of satire right now is to satirize everybody's endless goddamned sanctimony.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

In some instances, church employees have been fired simply for expressing support for gay marriage.But the U.S. bishops have no uniform policy on the issue, which is sparking controversy and much debate in the wider Catholic Church.The bishops of Germany are reportedly set to change their employment policies to allow married gays and lesbians, as well as divorced and remarried Catholics. A bishop in Belgium recently called on the church to consider blessing same-sex marriages.How many people are employed by the Archdiocese of Miami could not immediately be determined for this story. Archdiocese officials said the person who had that information was unavailable to comment."

(AP Photo/Goh Chai Hin, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6103bfd4410000708f81cd53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The contrast is striking: on one side, the 2016 U.S. presidential elections are already absorbing Washington's energy, the European Union is in an urgent need of decisive leadership and a series of severe crises are eroding Russia's power. On the other side, China, rapidly regaining a position of centrality, is developing a new grand strategy with a global vision.Far from being an empty rhetorical effect, Xi Jinping's New Silk Road will not only be one of the most discussed topics of 2015, but it will profoundly mark China's coming decade and reshape Eurasia.Backed by massive financial investments coming from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund, ""the Silk Road Economic Belt"", first announced on the occasion of a visit in Kazakhstan six months after Xi Jinping became China's President, and ""the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road"" are symbols of 21st century China and constitute for the Eurasian actors a historical opportunity.""Global China"" is certainly one of the features defining the Chinese renaissance, the country's opening up creates conditions in which the world impacts the Chinese society but an open China projects also herself globally, Xi's New Silk Road vision, reminiscent of the Tang dynasty's dynamics, illustrates this movement.Some observers can point out that Beijing's renewed focus on the Eurasian continent can be seen, in geopolitical terms, as an answer to the U.S. pivot to Asia initiated by the Obama administration, however, the New Silk Road should not be interpreted as a tactical scheme to counter other forces, it simply complements ""a new type of major-power relationship"" which characterizes the China/U.S. bilateral relations.The People's Republic of China, soon the world's largest economy, is aware that with power comes responsibility -- and vice versa. In a sense, the New Silk Road can be understood as a Marshall Plan with Chinese characteristics, it reassures the Middle Country's neighbors, contributes to their growth and places them in a system designed by Beijing.Xi's grand diplomacy has the advantage to envelop China's West, Xinjiang, one sixth of China's territory, de facto at the center of the Eurasian continent, is a key element of the Silk Road Economic Belt. Infrastructure projects, trade, innovative public/private partnerships will transform China's most Western region into an international platform and take it simultaneously closer to Shanghai, Turkey and Europe.It would be for China's first trading partner, the European Union, strategic blindness to miss the opportunities offered by Xi's proposal, a vision whose scope goes far beyond the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. 2015, year of the 40th anniversary of the China-EU relations, can mark a new departure for the relations between the two edges of Eurasia.While the China-EU 2020 Strategic Agenda and the negotiations on an investment agreement are positive developments, the EU's new trio, Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council and Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, should respond adequately to the New Silk Road initiative with a sense of historical responsibilities and the common destiny of Eurasians as a strategic horizon. If they fail to do so, they would take the risk to isolate the EU from a major trend which will, in any case, with the political determination and the economic might of Beijing change Eurasia.A Sino-European Silk Road Fund could be a complementary mechanism to finance large projects -- from infrastructure to education -- serving the shared vision of a peaceful and prosperous Eurasia. An ambitious trade agreement between the EU and China would complement the efforts to facilitate commercial exchanges across the Atlantic and across the Pacific.Italy, where the Silk Road has a unique significance, Germany, the country of Ferdinand Richthofen the geographer who coined the term ""Seidenstrasse"" and France, especially apt to conceive a bold and independent policy toward China, can push the European Union to seize the New Silk Road moment. Rome, Berlin and Paris will certainly get the full support of Eastern Europe whose history and culture are, through the Eurasian continuities, connected with Central Asia.Eurasia is under the immediate threat of a territorialized terrorism that will not be defeated with drones, killing machines which, on the contrary, generate infinite hatred and fuel radicalism.

Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which represents 200 civil rights and human rights organizations, and Marc Morial of the National Urban League said in a Tuesday letter to Scalise that they have questions about his past appearance before the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, or EURO, a group formed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.A Louisiana blogger last week uncovered Scalise's attendance at the 2002 event and it has since blown up. Scalise has said he regrets giving the speech and rejects all forms of bigotry, but maintains he was a short-staffed state lawmaker at the time and didn't know he was speaking to a neo-Nazi group. In their Tuesday letter, the civil rights advocates say they appreciate Scalise's condemnation of bigotry, but find it hard to believe he didn't know that EURO was a group led by Duke, especially since Duke's colleague, Kenny Knight, was the one who invited Scalise to speak. Knight and Scalise were neighbors.""To be candid ... it seems implausible to us that, as a state representative with national aspirations at the time, you would not have heard about the Louisiana-based EURO, which was already a well-known hate group led by America’s most famous white racist, former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke,"" write Henderson and Morial.""We are requesting, by way of this letter, the opportunity to meet with you to discuss these concerns and related issues regarding the leadership agenda for the 114th Congress,"" they add.A Scalise spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on whether Scalise would meet with the groups.House Republican leaders have stood by Scalise keeping his leadership post. Democrats have been critical, but have refrained from calling on him step down. That may be because they have plans to drag out the controversy.Civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis (D) said Tuesday it would help if Scalise apologized to his colleagues for speaking at the event.""I think somehow and in some way, he should come clean and say what he did and apologize to members of Congress, to his colleagues on both the Republican and the Democratic side of the aisle,"" Lewis told The Huffington Post.Asked if he thought Scalise's responses so far have constituted an apology, Lewis replied, ""I don't think so."""

Twelve people were killed including two police officers as two gunmen opened fire at the offices of the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo. (Photo by Rob Stothard/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f76c3c000032000db1df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Muslims the world over have strongly condemned Wednesday’s terrorist attack against the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed by masked gunmen. The paper is believed to have been targeted because of its history of publishing provocative cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. But what do the teachings of Islam actually say about creating images of the prophet?There's no part in the Quran where Muhammad says that images of him are forbidden. But the issue is mentioned in the hadith, a secondary text that many Muslims consult for instruction on how to live a good life.The theological underpinnings of the ban can be traced back to the very beginnings of Islam in Arabia, according to John Esposito, a professor of Islamic studies at Georgetown University. Early followers of Muhammad held themselves apart from their Christian neighbors, whom they believed to be too deeply attached to icons and images. The ban is also informed by one of the central tenets of Islam -- the idea that the Prophet Muhammad was a man, and not a god.“It comes from the notion that God is transcendent and that nothing should be put in God’s place,” Esposito told The Huffington Post. “Anything like that is idolatry. You don’t want to have a statue or a picture of God, because people may wind up praying to it.”For similar reasons, some Muslims object to depictions of Jesus or Moses, who are also considered prophets in Islam. In several Muslim countries, the films ""Noah"" and ""Exodus"" were banned this year because of their portrayal of these important figures, CNN reports.NOT JUST MUHAMMADThe issue isn’t unique to Islam -- it has also come up in the other Abrahamic traditions. In Judaism, the Bible depicts God as becoming deeply troubled after the ancient Israelites created and worshipped a golden calf. The Byzantine Empire saw the rise of the Iconoclasm movement, a name that literally means “image breaking.” The Metropolitan Museum of Art offers a primer on the period:Imperial legislation barred the production and use of figural images; simultaneously, the cross was promoted as the most acceptable decorative form for Byzantine churches. Archaeological evidence suggests that in certain regions of Byzantium, including Constantinople and Nicaea, existing icons were destroyed or plastered over. Very few early Byzantine icons survived the Iconoclastic period. An opposition to icons flared up again during the Protestant Reformation. The prominent Protestant theologian John Calvin wrote fiery sermons decrying man’s audacity in attempting to give God a human form. “God’s glory is corrupted by an impious falsehood whenever any form is attached to him,” Calvin wrote in his landmark 16th-century work Institutes of the Christian Religion.At around the same time, during the reign of King Edward VI in England, some believers went as far as to whitewash murals and destroy stained-glass windows that depicted Christ.'IT WAS QUITE DEVOTIONAL'In Islam, particularly in the Sunni tradition that developed in Arabia, there was never a strong impulse to represent Muhammad with images, according to Christiane Gruber, a professor of Islamic art at the University of Michigan. This resulted in the explosion of another kind of art that was used to beautify sacred spaces: elaborate calligraphy and intricate geometric patterns.  An Egyptian worker engraves Arabic calligraphy as part of a three-year, $1.4. million project to restore the Aslam al-Silahdar Mosque in Cairo.But the so-called ""Muslim world"" is not a monolith, and in fact, faithful Muslims have created images of the prophet for centuries. Gruber says the earliest paintings of Muhammad date from around the 1300s and originated in a region now made up of Turkey, Iraq and Iran. These were miniature images that would have been found in handwritten manuscripts illustrating the prophet’s life and teachings. Such manuscripts were rare luxuries, meant for private use inside a secular structure, like a king’s palace. They were likely commissioned by a ruling class that was “declaratively Sunni,” Gruber says. “It was a way for people to read about and contemplate the life of the prophet,” Gruber told HuffPost. “It was quite devotional.”By the 1500s, artists had begun to cover Muhammad’s face with a white veil, as seen in this example from 16th-century Iran. Some artists would give the prophet a normal human body, but would draw a bundle of bright flames in place of his head. It was their way of signaling that Muhammad was different -- not that he was divine, but that he was touched by the divine.THE MODERN ERAArtwork featuring Muhammad had become less common by the 1800s, although many examples still exist in Iran and Turkey. While the practice isn’t explicitly prohibited in the Quran, a consensus gradually developed among Muslim scholars that images of the prophet just aren’t acceptable.The turning point came in 2005, according to Gruber, when the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a series of cartoons depicting the prophet. Muslim leaders around the world came forward to categorically condemn all images of Muhammad. Unlike the paintings lovingly created by devout Muslim artists in past centuries, some of the Danish cartoons, which were widely reprinted in Western media during the controversy, were unmistakably meant to provoke.“It was a reactionary, traditionalist response to an event that was considered extraordinarily disrespectful to Muslim sensibilities,” Gruber said of the outcry in Muslim communities. “The problem with the images is not so much that they are images but that they are disrespectful images.”Extremists latched onto the cartoons as an opportunity to cause chaos and violence. Similarly, in 2011, Charlie Hebdo’s office in Paris was firebombed after the paper ran another inflammatory cover featuring the prophet.In 2012, an Egyptian-American immigrant named Nakoula Basseley Nakoula uploaded a video to YouTube called “Innocence of Muslims,” which depicted Muhammad as a drunk and a pedophile. The video led to international outrage, and The New York Times has suggested that the video helped to fuel the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.Imam Dr. Omar Shahin, the president of the North American Imam’s Federation, emphasized the importance of showing respect for other people's deeply held religious beliefs. He doesn't believe the prophet should ever be represented in an image. But he insists that the only proper ways for Muslims to speak out against depictions of Muhammad are by taking legal action or by educating the public -- not by committing acts of violence.“What those Muslims did was wrong, but what the newspaper did is also wrong. Two wrongs don’t make one right,” Shahin told HuffPost. “But we do not approve killing people, regardless of the reason. To us, this is a crime, and no Muslims should allow this to happen.” Papers reading 'We are Charlie' lie on the ground while people gather at a vigil in front of the French Embassy in Berlin following the terrorist attack in Paris on Jan. 7, 2015.Authorities haven’t yet confirmed the motivation behind Wednesday’s shooting, and the principal suspects are still at large as of this writing. Esposito said this type of terrorist attack is often committed by radicalized militants who use religion to legitimize their cause.“Given this kind of profile, these are people who really believe that there is a clash of civilizations and want to promote a clash,” said Esposito. But violence of the kind seen on Wednesday is by no means an inevitable result of religious differences. Many, like Omid Safi, director of Duke University's Islamic Studies Center, believe that a compromise can be reached -- and Safi says it will begin with acknowledging and reclaiming Islam’s rich art history.""There are other options available to Muslims than either accepting the Danish Cartoonist caricatures of the Prophet, or responding in pure anger and hatred,"" Safi wrote in a 2010 blog post for FaithStreet. ""One such answer is a return to the rich pietistic Islamic tradition of depicting the Prophet who was sent, according to the Qur’an, as a mercy to all the Universe.""In an email to HuffPost Thursday, Safi argued that while ""we need to hang on to and honor freedom of speech,"" people still need to be mindful of how they use that freedom.""Yes, the freedom of speech includes the right to speak offensive words, including words that disturb and unsettle,"" he wrote. ""I simply want us to always keep the context in mind ... I wonder how much we have gained if we honor free speech and degrade human beings. I have no ultimate answers, but I do wonder.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said that Safi is a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is at Duke University."
