0,TRAVEL,The Best Way To See A Historic Theater: Handel At Versailles (PHOTOS),"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-eighteenthcentury-oper_us_5b9b65dde4b03a1dcc773cc8,"If you want to get a good sense of a historic theater at work, you ought to see a performance rather than signing up for the half-hour tour.",2012-03-20,"The Opéra Royal at Versailles, a performer's-eye view",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b65dd2000003000fd2ed0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I've long maintained that, even for an atheist, the best way to see a church is to attend a service there. Indeed, some churches can be viewed only during services; here I think of the Chapels Royal at London's St. James's Palace. Moreover, these buildings were built as places of worship, and they are at their best when functioning, especially when the choir is good and the sermon brief (as is often the case in the Anglican sphere). Similarly, if you want to get a good sense of a historic theater at work, you ought to see a performance rather than signing up for the half-hour tour. When Jackie and I were thinking about our March trip to London and Paris, we used the excellent music websites bachtrack.com and operabase.com and found a concert performance of Handel's 1735 opera Ariodante to be given at the Opéra Royal in the Château de Versailles -- with our favorite performers to boot (mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato and conductor Alan Curtis). The prospect was exciting enough to influence the dates of our train travel down from London -- if we could get tickets: it is a blessedly small theater of 700-odd seats that sell out quickly.We were lucky. I logged on to the Versailles website (which lists all coming performances) and was able to buy two of the few remaining tickets at €100 ($130) apiece. Not only did we hear a work of the theater's own era (more or less: construction began just a few years after the composer's death), but we heard it played on period instruments by specialists in the Baroque style: the Italy-based ensemble Il Complesso Barocco, founded by Mr. Curtis in 1992. Plus, our seats (in a box not far from the stage) gave us a good view of our fellow audience members, which added its own kind of 18th-century authenticity: By all accounts, people-watching was an important part of the evening's entertainment in those times (as distinct from today, when nobody would ever dream of checking out anyone else's outfit).We arrived at the château (after stumbling along roughly cobbled sidewalks; do NOT wear your Louboutins) to see that Ms. DiDonato was unwell and had been obliged to cancel her appearance. But to everyone's great relief she was replaced by the excellent English mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly. Over the years we've come to love small theaters, and to hear Ms. Connolly and her amazing colleagues, including soprano Karina Gauvin and contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux, in these intimate surroundings was to hear them anew. (You can hear them- - but with Ms. DiDonato in the title role -- at home, too, on an addictive Virgin Classics recording of the opera.)The theater has been restored, not re-imagined. There's elaborate gilded plasterwork; wall and ceiling paintings; baroque balustrades; and acres of faux marble. The latter is painted to be seen from a distance and can look coarse close up (i.e. six inches behind your seat). During the intermission we walked into one of the royal boxes, which differ little from the others apart from the presence of gilt grilles that can be closed for the sake of privacy. Perhaps most interesting of all, the lighting is at approximately 18th-century candle-lit levels, including in the unadorned corridors that take you to the auditorium.Seeing a performance rather than merely viewing the theater helped us understand the space and its function. And, frankly, we felt special visiting the château with a purpose -- and after closing time -- rather than just ambling through to gawk at the chandeliers: almost as if we belonged there, which is preposterous in more ways than I can even begin to list.On a practical note, today's Versailles is basically a one-horse suburban town: it is not easy to find something decent to eat after a show, especially when it ends at a quarter to midnight, as Ariodante atypically did: most performances end far earlier. Happily, the Brasserie du Théâtre (part of the Flo group of old-timey brasseries) is a seven-minute walk from the château and takes reservations (including on-line) for as late as 11:30, though the staff was flexible enough to accept an open-ended post-theater reservation and could not have been more welcoming when we arrived at nearly 12 o'clock. You might want to verify this, possibly through your hotel's concierge, before assuming they'll be willing to feed you that late. Supper was welcome and very good: my grilled andouillette (a sausage made mostly of veal guts) was one of the nicest I've had, and our dessert (floating island) was terrific, with a little pool of caramel at the bottom of the bowl under all the vanilla custard.To avoid a tiresome trek back to Paris, we stayed the night at the luxurious Trianon Palace hotel, also right near the château. Through hotels.com, we'd booked a comfortable but not gorgeous double room for $240, which was money well spent: It's a lovely hotel, and the service (especially on the part of the concierge team) was particularly fine.Of course, we took advantage of being in Versailles to spend the next morning at the château and its gardens, noting that the Opera House was off limits with a smidgeon of been-there-done-that smugness."

But still.On Tuesday Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, journeyed to Norway to visit Queen Sonja and King Harald, Princess Mette-Marit and Prince Haakon and the rest of the royal Norwegian family, as well as to meet and pay tribute to  survivors of the Utoya massacre .The royal couple debarked from their plane as attendants carried (what appears to be!) their Louis Vuitton monogrammed luggage. Camilla, clad in a Bruce Oldfield coat and dress and a navy blue Philip Treacy hat, and Charles, wearing a navy suit, greeted local dignitaries. Later, the couple met with the king and queen of Norway for a wreath-laying ceremony at Oslo's national monument.The night was capped off with an official dinner at the Norwegian Royal Palace, where the group was joined by Princess Astrid and Princess Martha-Louise.  We're especially loving the pics of Camilla and Queen Sonja in their color-coordinated suits -- Camilla in purple Anna Valentine, Sonja in bright pink -- clutching ribbon-adorned gift bags. Even their shoes match!Also, a soldier fainted while waiting for Charles and Camilla to arrive. (See slideshow.) This story keeps getting stranger.Tuesday's trip kicks off Camilla and Charles' eight-day tour of Scandanavia. They'll also visit Norway's second-largest city, Bergen, before they venture to Stockholm in Sweden, and then Copenhagen and Jutland in Denmark. Ties between the royal families of Norway and the UK are traditionally tight, for myriad reasons which you can read about here.See photos of the royal meet-and-greet below!PHOTOS:"

The store has teamed up with a dating website to pair shoe-obsessed women with men who will pay for for their purchases, in exchange for a date. Here's how it works:The men sign up on the dating site Lunch Actually and pick out 20 shoes that they would like to see a potential date wear. The guys then pledge to pay for anywhere from 10 to 100 percent of the cost of the shoe. (A good indicator of their desperation?) When a woman buys a pair of shoes at the Kuala Lumpur store, she can then go online and check out her potential shoe-gar daddies' profiles. After one date, a woman can be reimbursed by her match. You might be wondering -- isn't this a form of shoe prostitution? Shoes Shoes Shoes sees the system more like something that would happen on HBO's hit show ""Sex and the City."" As the store writes on its Facebook page:Why sit and wait for Mr. Right to drop from the sky? Go do what you like most first - shop for shoes and live out your ""Sex And The City"" dreams (think Carrie!). and leave it to the professionals to find you your Mr. Big. with a possible discount of 100% to boot.Most commenters on the store's Facebook page seem enamored with ""Shoe Dating"" -- and the shirtless male models Shoes Shoes Shoes has put in its store. Still, some have wondered if the idea is sexist. Commenter Sheila Santharamohana asked:Can you imagine if it was the other way round? When a man bought shoes, he'd get a woman for a date as well? We'd all be screaming blue murder at the sexism. Why do we countenance this unethical marketing gimmick? For shame.Shoes Shoes Shoes responded: Yes, Sheila. you're right. Women would and should be screaming murder if it was the other way round. That's why shoe dating isn't the other way round. :) Anyway, thanks for the feedback, peeps! A good weekend to all!What do you think? Would you go on a date in exchange for a free pair of shoes?Check out photos of the Shoes Shoes Shoes' male model-filled windows: "
