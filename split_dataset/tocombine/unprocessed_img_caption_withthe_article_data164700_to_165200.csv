When Punk'd premiered on MTV in 2003, the collective celebrity community held its breath, wondering who would be the next victim to be humiliated on national television in the name of harmless fun. Recent tricksters have taken this same form of star-centered pranking in a more sinister direction by reporting fabricated emergencies in celebrity homes. The recent ""swatting"" trend, whereby pranksters place 911 calls to alert authorities about fake home invasions, robberies and potential hostage situations, have placed victims like Ashton Kutcher, Justin Bieber, Tom Cruise, Simon Cowell and Chris Brown at the center of full-blown emergency response protocols.The steady increase in ""swatting"" incidents against celebrities led Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca to support a new bill sponsored by California State Sen. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) to increase the severity of sentences and improve restitution regulations for individuals convicted of reporting false crimes to law enforcement. The bill increases the financial responsibility of those convicted of such crimes and requires at least a 120-day jail sentence, as well as raises the likelihood of felony filings should any injury occur as the result of police response. Despite the increased visibility these types of pranks receive as a result of their celebrity victims, these hoaxes existed long before the recent trend in falsified celebrity emergencies. Fake police reports made in the computer gaming community started years ago in response to game rivalries. A teenage hacker named Matthew Weigman was even sentenced to 11 years in federal prison in 2009 due to his role in a ""swatting"" hoax that led to more than 250 different incidents. These pranks represent an emerging predicament for police organizations and other first responders who are now working together to promote stiffer penalties for convicted hoaxers and to take down ""spoofing"" technology frequently used in such pranks. These incidents waste police resources and place innocent civilians in danger by putting potential victims in front of firepower and unsuspecting drivers in the way of dispatch teams racing to the scene of fake crimes. Through new legislation and increased publicity concerning the consequences of false police reports, law enforcement agencies hope to address this disturbing trend in the world of celebrity obsession.The technology implicated with this new prank scheme makes it difficult to locate the tricksters. The few who have been caught by law enforcement have been found to be children. What kids might think is a harmless and humorous prank can be a federal offense and can result in serious injury or death. Recently, a 12-year-old boy linked to a Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher ""swatting"" incident was arrested and is awaiting charges. Pranks are just not what they use to be before the advent of spoofing technology, when innocent prank calls were nothing more than spur-of-the-moment fun with friends. Now, these pranks are premeditated and well-designed. Kids can easily access the technology that permits them to hack into a computer system and stage the ""swatting"" havoc.Herein lies the call to action for parents to chat with your kids about the dangers and repercussions of ""swatting."" Educate now before your child becomes the mastermind behind the next celebrity ""swatting"" scandal."

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc54f2200003000d95ed0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like so many mothers of young children, I've been listening to the gun control debate with renewed interest ever since the Sandy Hook tragedy. Having lived in several high-crime cities where innocents are caught in the crossfire of gun violence, I've come to see gun control as a public health and safety issue. But, then again, having spent time in Wyoming among cowboys and hunters, unexpected environmentalists and ""responsible"" gun owners, I've come to understand the strong cultural affinity some people have for their guns.But what I don't understand, what I struggle to make sense of, is the need for semi-automatic weapons and the vociferous defense of the right to own one.I'll ignore for the moment that the NRA, as much a gun industry lobby as a rights organization, is motivated by a ""bottom line"" to sell more guns and stop anything that makes it harder to do so. I'll also ignore for the moment their argument that the answer to gun violence is more guns, which doesn't hold up under five minutes of thought or a glance beyond our borders. And I'll leave alone the dubious argument that armed citizens are what's keeping us from government tyranny.What I'm not ignoring, what I'm trying to understand, is what is it that's really animating these gun enthusiasts to cling so tightly to weapons that can spray bullets in rapid fire succession. How can seemingly normal people who raise kids, pay taxes and go grocery shopping justifying owning something like this?Hunting is no longer the issue here. And ""rights"" don't seem to cut it. I'm less worried about your ""right"" to own such a quick instrument of death than the right of innocent people not to be killed in the crossfire.So, why, honestly, does anyone have any need for such a thing? What you hear most in the responses to this question is fear. Of unchecked government tyranny, of some boogeyman trampling on a vague notion of ""freedom,"" of the inability to defend their families from... well... bad guys.To quote Wayne LaPierre, the executive VP of the NRA, ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.""You know who else thinks of the world this way, where the bad guys need to be beaten and the good guys save the day?My 4-year-old son.It's a storyline he enjoys because it makes the world easier to understand, less confusing and unpredictable. You talk to good guys, and you stay away from the bad guys. You befriend the good guys and you fight the bad guys.Sophisticated adults understand that there are people, most of whom are flawed and some of whom make horrible choices, who cannot be neatly divided into such distinct categories, one to be armed and the other to be defended against. No one in the history of time has done this effectively. It's a fairy tale. You can only hope that fallible humans don't have their mistakes turn into tragedies by getting hold of easy instruments of death.Take Philip Sailors, a Vietnam veteran with no criminal history; a man who volunteered on mission trips. You might brand him a ""good guy"" if forced to choose. Or you could say he is a person who made a horrible irrevocable decision when he allegedly shot dead a young man parked incorrectly -- the result of bad GPS directions -- in his driveway. And it might just have been this simplistic good guy/bad guy world view combined with paranoia and easy access to firearms that turned his fear into tragedy. But I won't borrow their terminology. I still won't call him a ""bad guy."" People are more complex than that. My 4-year-old will learn that lesson as he grows and learns about the world. I just hope the world he learns about looks a bit more sane by then."
2,PARENTING,School Time Is Money:  Are More Hours Worth the Cost?,"Patte Barth, Contributor

(AP Photo/Jim Mone)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc557250000350036337e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The nation's 15,000 school districts are as varied as the communities they serve, but in the post-recession era, there's one thing they all have in common. They're broke. And getting broker. I have three criteria for identifying promising policies and practices to improve student learning. First of all, schools need something that will be effective. But once that's established, they also want something that's cheap and easy to implement. Naturally, this trio of attributes is hard to come by. More often than not, ""cheap,"" ""easy"" or both have to take a backseat to ""effective."" That can't stop us from trying, though. Schools face a double challenge right now. They need to make sure all students, not just some, graduate well-prepared for college and careers, and in many cases, they need to do it with fewer dollars. This means districts really need to target their already stretched resources where they will get the most bang for the buck. Which brings me to the issue of increasing school time. The case for more time is promoted by Education Secretary Arne Duncan and recently got a big boost with the launch of the TIME collaborative  -- a five-state, 11-district effort to raise student achievement by adding 300 more hours to the school schedule. Not everyone is on board, however. Some parents and teachers think longer school hours intrude on the time kids have to just be kids. Other parents like the idea, especially the extra supervision their children get and not having to worry about child care. For me, I just want to know if it will work. Back to my criteria. Adding days and hours to the schedule is relatively easy, but it's definitely not cheap. More school time needs to be staffed, buildings need to be lit and heated longer, and students need to be transported on additional days, making it one of the most expensive policies to implement. Even so, if students gained a lot by being in school longer the extra costs may be worth it. But do they? Research is not so clear. Last year, the Center for Public Education, where I work, analyzed the amount of time students are required to be in school in different countries . We found little relationship between time required and student outcomes. High-scoring Finland, for example, requires the least hours compared to low-scoring Italy which requires the most. Other research shows that more school time can relate to more learning, as long as the time is focused on academic learning. Year-round schooling can also be helpful by preventing summer learning loss and the need to spend the first weeks of school reviewing material that's already been taught, which is arguably a waste of the time schools already have. Still the gains aren't always spectacular especially in relation to the expense. The TIME collaborative has the benefit of Ford Foundation money to support it. The participating school districts also have the flexibility to use their federal Title 1 dollars. We will likely learn a lot more about the relationship between school time and learning as they roll out their plans over the next few years. In the meantime, other districts might do better to look into some other possibilities before making the leap to more school time. Among these:• There is much more evidence that points to the impact of teaching and rich curriculum on student achievement than to more school time. Before adding hours for students, districts might want to look into investing in teachers, including professional development and yes, more time for them to collaborate. They should also assure all students have access to high-level subject matter during the time they're in school.• Conduct an audit of the current schedule. There's often a surprising amount of unproductive time in the calendar, for example, school assemblies, transfer time between classes, testing days, not to mention the dreaded PA announcements which can all add up to nice bucket of time that could be recaptured for instruction. Schools may not be able to reclaim all of it, or want to, but it's worth a look. • Look at attendance data. Students who aren't in school while their peers are lose out on instruction and fall behind. If this is a problem in the district, policies to prevent absenteeism might be the best investment. Be sure to pay attention to teacher attendance, too. Indeed, high teacher absenteeism can be the canary bird alerting district leaders to a potentially toxic school climate, which is bad on its own terms as well as being unproductive.• Rather than add days to the school year, consider distributing existing days more evenly over the year. A shorter summer break is an easy way to prevent learning loss. In the end, adding hours may be the way to go to improve student achievement. But school boards and superintendents should still be strategic and target the extra time to the students who stand to benefit most. And regardless of the strategies they pursue, the need to monitor progress to make sure they're getting the results they want. This will truly keep time on our side."

Most people acknowledge that growing up in a divorced home can make relationships harder as an adult. My mom and I asked the women we spoke with what they felt they could to make sure their own relationships last. The foundation of our work has always been that even if you grew up in a divorced home, you have the ability to make healthy choices and are not doomed to repeat the mistakes witnessed in your family of origin.Laura, a bright occupational therapist in her mid-twenties, stated that having ""similar lifestyle preferences and values"" was essential to making a relationship work. Megan, a graphic designer who just moved in with her boyfriend of three years, underscored the importance of taking your time to get to know your partner and knowing yourself ""inside and out"" before making a permanent commitment. Jenna, who recently married and just closed on a house with her new husband, shared that she was able to build trust and confidence in her husband Tom by letting him ""prove through his actions that he was there for me.""We interviewed more than 200 women who grew up in divorced homes as a follow-up to my mother's original study, which investigated the relationship between self-esteem and parental divorce and was published in the Journal of Divorce & Remarriage. All of these women dealt with the distress of divorce as children, but were determined to enjoy lasting love as adults. All of them provided great ideas about how they felt they could make their relationships work -- even though their parents' didn't. As we met with these women over a few years, we got to know them and rooted for them. Many of them stayed in touch, both in person and through email, and like any group of people, some experienced great joys, while others endured heartbreak.You can try to do everything right, but sometimes long-term relationships and marriages just don't work out. Most people know at least one couple who just seem to have gotten it right and have been together many years. Sometimes the way people meet, fall in love, and stay together can seem very serendipitous, and people will say, ""They got really lucky when they found one another."" What separates the ""lucky"" couples from the people that aren't able to make it work?If you're not in a healthy emotional state, it's obvious that you won't attract a good partner, and the breakup of such a relationship seems inevitable. But what if you are ready for love, you have tried to make all the right choices, you get married, and boom, twenty years later, your spouse comes clean with an affair and the marriage ends? Was there something you could have done to prevent it? In some cases, yes; in some cases, no. Did the woman down the block who has remained happily married have some insight that you didn't? It's possible that she did, and it's possible that she was just more fortunate.I do believe that despite a person's best effort, life sometimes just happens and important things, like relationships, can become unglued. Time changes people. This doesn't mean that you are helpless to control your life, and it doesn't mean that you're any less qualified to enjoy a happy relationship. But it does mean that you don't deserve it when your relationship ends. You can do everything possible to make sure your marriage lasts, and sometimes, it just doesn't work. So you can be jealous of those people who got ""lucky"" and are still together, or you can accept that life has different plans in store for you.Since our work is primarily about helping adults who grew up in divorced homes find lasting love, I don't want to discount the idea that people can exert control over their future. They can. But sometimes events change people in ways you can't plan for. People get laid off from their jobs, they get sick, or endure other major life stresses. Some people are lucky. Some people don't get laid off from their jobs, or get sick. Some people stay married, and stay married happily. Some of these outcomes have to do with making good choices. But some people make good choices and still have bad luck.The truth is that whether a person stays married or not, each person has their own road to hoe in life. Life is rarely easy for anyone, and when it is easy, it's never easy all of the time. What is easy is to feel bad for yourself when something bad happens (like a divorce) and wish things were different. In life, you win some and you lose some. Accepting that life rarely -- if ever --goes according to plan is the first step in healing from any unfortunate turn.Do you think some people just get lucky in relationships?

What causes the desire to repack the suitcases and take to the skies or get in the car in search of learning or experiencing something new? Many domestic travelers plan to visit family and friends and partake in some local activity. Other people desire to travel internationally on a quest to discover that special ""sense of place"" at an exotic destination. Within the last decade the growing significance of tourism and travel as a form of economic development for most countries in the world has made tourism one of the most important global businesses. Countries and cities are developing and marketing their resources for tourism in hopes that you will decide to travel and discover what they have to offer that is exciting to you. Curious about why my friends were traveling during the holiday season, many told me they wanted to spend a few days with family but then they planned to travel to some place they had not visited in the past. Many said they wanted to discover new cities, participate in cultural exchanges, or try something adventurous, but most of all, they were interested in traveling for culinary tourism -- one of the fastest growing segments of the tourism industry. From students to seniors, the interest in travel to discover and taste new foods, observe how food is grown, processed, and prepared has become a fascination of people of all ages. During my holiday break, I visited family in San Francisco, where dining on fresh seafood, especially Dungeness crab, was important. Then to my home in Portland, Oregon, which has become known as a culinary tourism destination. Portland's culinary tourism offers everything -- from a large variety of food-truck dining to amazing gourmet restaurants. The focus is on fresh foods from the abundance of produce grown in the area -- the real farm to table dining experience. This is one of the primary reasons I travel. I want to discover what makes one destination different from another but especially to discover the local cuisine. How about you? Why do you travel? What is the motivation?

Then, in 2008, her mother went into atrial fibrillation and was diagnosed with a hole in her heart at age 53. Mary Leah knew she should see a cardiologist too, but she was about to give birth at the time. She promised herself she would do it once she got through the pregnancy. For now, she was just relieved her mother was going to be able to see her granddaughter grow up.Two years later, at age 30, Mary Leah finally made good on her promise and visited her mom's doctor. She'd had a few symptoms like lightheadedness, heart palpitations and nausea, but she had assumed these were the result of her busy lifestyle. She was working full time, finishing her Ph.D. and taking care of a toddler, after all. Following several normal results for weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, a test revealed that her heart was enlarged and was only functioning at 10 percent.But this was not the worst news she would receive. After seven months of treatment, she learned that her heart condition had hardly improved. Surgeons implanted a dual chamber defibrillator, or as Mary Leah calls them, ""jumper cables for the heart."" The defibrillator will restart her heart if necessary, but won't improve the underlying condition. At this point, a heart transplant is necessary.The fact that each generation of Mary Leah's family has suffered from heart disease makes her extra cautious when it comes to her daughter. In addition to making sure she lives an active, healthy lifestyle, she takes her for a cardiac check-up every year. ""I want to be sure she leads as healthy a life as possible starting now,"" Mary Leah says. ""I'm working to create a legacy for her and others because I am alive and not a statistic.""In 2004, the American Heart Association, along with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute launched National Wear Red Day® to raise awareness of heart disease as the No. 1 killer of women. Since then, millions of women have been fighting heart disease individually and together as part of the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women® movement.The good news is we've made great progress! In the last 10 years, more than 627,000 women's lives have been saved, and 330 fewer women are dying per day. We've also made women more aware of their greatest health risk. When Go Red For Women began, only 13 percent of women identified heart disease as their No. 1 killer; now 54 percent of women know that heart disease is the leading killer of women. Although we have made tremendous strides towards ending this disease, we still have a long way to go. Heart disease still causes one in three women's deaths in the U.S. With the right information, education and care, heart disease in women can be treated, prevented, and even ended.Throughout the many major political, social and technological milestones of the past decade, one thing has remained the same. Our goal. And we believe now is the time to stand stronger and demand change.As we approach this milestone 10th National Wear Red Day, I challenge you to Go Red in bolder ways than ever before. This February, let's do more than wear red proudly and tell our social network. As the old adage goes, let's ""Paint the town RED!""

Sean chose the shopping scene for his date with Leslie on ""The Bachelor."" A recent client of mine chose to reenact the rescue scene (pictures below). You should choose either the most romantic scene or the most memorable scene in the movie. Find the location Now that you have the scene from the movie picked out, you have to find the location that is going to work to recreate your movie. For our ""Pretty Woman"" proposal, we picked Hotel San Carlos in Phoenix because of its fire escape. If your girlfriend's favorite movie is ""Titanic"" you might want to rent out a boat or ship. If you wanted to reenact ""The Notebook,"" you could find a home on the lake. Get the Right PropsAfter the location is chosen, you need to make sure you have all of the right props. For Sean, he ensured that Leslie had a rented-out gorgeous necklace which was a huge part of the movie. For you, you may need to have a horse drawn carriage, a dance posse (think ""West Side Story"") or anything else. Dress the PartNo matter what the movie is that you choose to recreate, you need to go all out. Dress up as Prince Charming, a dancer, or a knight in shining armor. Whatever it takes, make sure you go all out or it won't be convincing. Stay in CharacterIf you want the date or the proposal to be truly amazing, do not break character. If your movie star has an accent, you have an accent. If your movie star bites his nails, you bite your nails. Get it?DocumentIf the movie reenactment is for a big event like a proposal or an anniversary date, make sure you document it with photography or videography. If you follow these guidelines it is going to be epic and she will want to share it with everyone.

The era of the supersized cola may come to an end in New York City on Thursday, when health officials are expected to approve an unprecedented 16-ounce (470-milliliter) limit on sodas and other sugary drinks at restaurants, delis and movie theaters. Nunez says she drinks an extra large drink every day after work. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc1732200005600d95d32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to a recent meta-analysis of research studies on the consumption of sugar, lowering sugar intake results in ""a small but significant reduction in body weight for adults."" I don't argue with the conclusions drawn by Dr. Lisa Te Morenga and her colleagues, which were published in the British Medical Journal. I merely believe it is discouraging to all those who are striving valiantly to reduce the extraordinarily high amount of sugar believed to be consumed annually in the average American diet: more than 150 pounds a year. That breaks down to nearly three pounds of sugar per person every week. Statistics like that don't shock me anymore. As a bariatric physician and medical director of a wellness center in Naples, Fla., that is focused helping men and women who are struggling to lose and maintain their weight, I see the toll in human suffering every day. All the studies and the findings don't go far enough. Sugar -- especially in soft drinks -- should be placed in the same category as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes. I can hear the moans from Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but it is a fact that reducing the amount of sugar in sweetened drinks can make a huge difference. It is a fact that 33 percent of the sugar we consume comes from beverages. That's more sugar from soda and other sweetened beverages than from any other source of carbohydrates. Soda makers get it. If anyone doubts that those giant companies are not trying to make products with reduced sugar content, examine the shelves in your neighborhood supermarket. You will see every kind of ""diet"" soda, even one called ""Zero."" Clearly, they know that the tide is turning and their products are part of a very serious public health issue that is not going to evaporate.After decades of working with seriously obese and overweight men, women and children, I know that decreasing sugar from the diets of children and adults is critical to controlling weight. The most insidious thing about sugar is that it makes one hungry. In fact, it acts as an appetite stimulant. In 80 to 90 percent of the patients who come to me for help with weight loss, I have found irrefutable test evidence of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a metabolic condition that simply makes it easy to gain and hard to lose weight. Insulin delivers energy-producing sugar to the body's cells. For those who are insulin resistant, there's a problem with sugar transfer into the cells. The result is a false sense of starvation and my patients actually crave carbohydrates and sugars -- the exact foods their bodies have a problem metabolizing. It's like a vicious circle; they want more, but their bodies simply can't process it. So perhaps you are wondering why insulin resistance is such a problem. Some experts believe that 1 in 3 Americans is insulin resistant. That's more than 100 million people who are generating more insulin than their bodies can process. Consequently, they get large abdomens. Their internal organs can have dangerous fat deposits. Left unchecked, ultimately, it leads to the metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes and a host of additional disorders and diseases. However, successful weight loss won't work if the food doesn't taste good. I defy anyone to come up with a good-tasting diet meal that is filled with chemicals, preservatives and artificial sweeteners. They won't taste good no matter how popular the celebrity or the former professional athlete is. That's the fundamental reason why the short-term packaged foods that taste like cardboard never work. It becomes the classic yo-yo diet that fills the patient with false food, false hope and a bad taste.   There's no quick diet, silver bullet or single pill that will alleviate the problem overnight. But the good news is there's a scientific solution that has helped many people. That solution is a controlled carbohydrate and adequate protein diet with the protein spread out throughout the day. It is what I and my team of dietitians use to correct the metabolic issues, including elevated blood sugar and high triglycerides. This metabolism approach is not a fad or a yo-yo diet or the latest appetite suppressant. It is an evidence-based, thoroughly proven and highly effective strategy for overcoming excessive weight and obesity. However, it won't work if the food doesn't taste good.The first step in achieving successful weight loss is cutting sugar consumption. I'm glad the researchers are finally catching on.For more by Caroline J. Cederquist, M.D., click here.For more on diet and nutrition, click here."
10,WELLNESS,4 Ridiculously Healthy (And Delicious!) Pizzas for Your Super Bowl Party,"Heather Bauer, Contributor

That's how you would typically describe your Super Bowl Sunday menu. Let's face it: Watching the big game noshing on raw broccoli and carrots just isn't as much fun as noshing on pizza. I'm sure even the biggest health foodies admit to a little splurge during the Super Bowl. (I know I'm guilty!)But, what if there were ways to make these greasy, fattening and high-calorie foods diet friendly? Listen up because I have a solution: It's pizza! You heard me. Pizza has the potential to be ridiculously healthy -- it covers all the food groups! Hold the delivery this year and get creative in the kitchen. Try one of my favorite healthy spins on the not-so-greasy good stuff. For the Low-Carb Lover: How thin can you go? Besides being delicious, thin-crust pizza clocks in fewer carbs, which means fewer calories than traditional or deep-dish pizzas. It's time to take thin crust to the next level. Use a La Tortilla low-carb, high-fiber tortilla for your dough. (I had to do a double take myself when I saw this tortilla was only 50 calories and covers more than half of your daily recommended fiber.) Top the tortilla with Cucina Antica tomato sauce, low-fat organic cheddar cheese and chicken. Just bake until the cheese is melted and tortilla is a little crispy for a nutritious Super Bowl snack you won't feel guilty about. For the Creative Chef: If you're feeling adventurous in the kitchen, you can even ditch the carb-loaded crust all together and make a cauliflower crust instead. I know it sounds crazy and not too appetizing, but I was sold after my first bite. To make the crust, just chop cauliflower into chunks, pulse in a food processor, and then sauté in a skillet. Check out one of my favorite recipes from the Eating Bird Food blog.For the Mushroom Lover: Stuffed mushrooms have been making mouths water for years, but the dieter in your head tells you to walk away because the combination of cream cheese, breadcrumbs and cheese is a dieting disaster. Well, now you can have your stuffed mushroom and eat it, too -- in the form of a portobello pizza. Stuff a portobello mushroom with all your favorite pizza fixings. Your guests will love this personal portobello pizza recipe from Hungry Girl. Keep it skinny by using low-fat cheese and making your own pizza sauce. My Favorite Frozen Pick: If you're crunched for time or just not in the mood to cook, a healthy pizza can still be part of your Super Bowl menu. The frozen food section in the grocery store can be overwhelming. Too much sodium, too much sugar and too good to be true typically come to mind. I'm going to make it easy for you this year. When my clients have a pizza craving, I tell them to keep a Kashi Thin Crust Pizza BBQ Recipe Chicken in their freezer. It's packed with whole grains, fiber and protein, which will help you feel full faster. It will be the hit of the party!For more by Heather Bauer, RD, CDN, click here.For more on diet and nutrition, click here."

I never thought I'd be a snappy, gritona mom, but sometimes I feel like that's the only way I can get my girl to pay attention, focus and, well, do what I want/need her to do. At age 5, it just feels like one minute I'm her ""best mom ever"" and the next she's warning me how I am not the boss of her.The worst part is that the screaming, yelling and nagging I do are pretty much always for the same things.""Hurry up and get dressed. This is the last time I warn you!""""Now. Get in the shower right this second or else (insert futile threat).""""Stop it! Just stay still and quiet for 10 seconds!""It's just so obvious that my high-pitched strategy is getting us nowhere. The behavior I'm expecting from my daughter has not gotten better because what I'm doing is just being confrontational and even desperate in my attempt to ""fix"" a problem without digging deeper to find strategies that would be more long-term.Related: 11 signs you're a babysitter's worst nightmareFortunately, I got an email in my inbox last week that introduced me to parenting expert Amy McCready, founder of Positive Parenting Solutions and author of If I Have to Tell You One More Time...The Revolutionary Program That Gets Your Kids to Listen Without Nagging, Reminding or Yelling (Tarcher/Penguin, 2011). Aha! That sounded not only like a book I needed to read yesterday, but also like an expert I must consult because she's been through what I've been: the screaming, nagging and yelling parenting days that get you on a high road to nowhere.McCready is a champion of positive parenting techniques for happier families and well-behaved kids. She's developed strategies and methods that empower us as parents to take control, in the positive sense of the word, and understand how to truly motivate our children to want to be on their best behavior.""You can  correct the misbehaviors quickly and permanently! But, only if you address the root cause of the behavior,"" says McCready, who's mom to two teenage boys. ""You need more than a Band-Aid on symptoms -- you must understand what really motivates the misbehavior and have the concrete tools to address the root issue.""McCready agreed to share with us her top 10 tips to getting to the root of our child's misbehavior and turning it into better behavior, sans the nasty yelling and nagging no one can stand. Click through below for McCready's advice in her own words.1. Spend one-on-one time with kids on a daily basis This is the most important advice I give to parents. Kids are hard-wired to need an emotional connection and attention every day, and if they don't get it, consequences and other discipline tools won't be effective (not to mention the fact that they might resort to practicing their ninja scream indoors just to turn your head). Just 10-15 minutes of one-on-one quality time once or twice a day will do wonders to fend off negative behavior from your kids! 2. Everyone contributes All kids, toddlers to teens, should be responsible for family contributions (not ""chores"") they do on a daily basis. When you expect your kids to contribute at home, you'll develop important life skills, foster family teamwork and ward off the entitlement epidemic. 3. Be a stickler for bedtimes Most toddlers to teens get far less sleep than their growing bodies need. Consult your pediatrician about the hours of shut-eye kids need by age and if necessary, adjust the bedtime backwards by 10 minutes every few nights. A well-rested kid is a well-behaved kid! 4. Training, not time outs If Time Outs aren't working for you, take heart. It's not you and it's not your kids. Forcing a child to go to his room or the naughty chair for a prescribed period of time does nothing to teach him to make a better choice next time. For a strong-willed child, Time Out will most certainly escalate the power struggle. Instead, ask the question... ""What can I do to teach him to make a better choice next time?"" Focusing on training rather than punishment will almost always deliver better results. 5. Don't play judge & jury in your kids' fights Parents escalate sibling rivalry when they step in to determine who's at fault and who should receive a punishment. Taking sides creates a winner and loser and fuels competition. It also robs kids of the valuable opportunity to work out the conflict on their own. Ignore kids' squabbles whenever possible and if you need to step in, simply say, ""I'm not concerned with who started it, I'm here to help you come up with a solution. What ideas do you have to resolve this problem?"" 6. Be clear -- and simple -- about your family rules First, narrow down your top 50 family rules to a handful that are most important. Then, assign a consequence, warn your kids ahead of time and stand your ground. For instance, remind kids that access to technology is a privilege, not a right, and be crystal clear about rules for a smartphone or computer. If they aren't willing to follow your family rules for technology, it goes away. Assure them the public library has rows of computers they can use for homework. 7. Be a YES Mom or Dad Kids hear us say ""no"" or ""don't"" more times than we care to know--and they resent it (wouldn't you?). Find opportunities to say ""yes"" when you would normally say ""no."" When your son asks to go to the park after school and you know there's no way it can fit in the schedule, say ""yes"" instead: ""The park sounds awesome! Would you like to go this Friday after school or on Saturday morning?""For 3 more tips for better behavior from your kids, visit Babble!MORE ON BABBLE: 25 horrifying photos of stuff kids have ruined 10 things you should never say to a mom 11 mistakes all parents make (even the perfect ones!)
