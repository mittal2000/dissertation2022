Nintendo's 1998 Game Boy Camera plugged into the classic handheld gaming system and let you snap black-and-white pictures of whatever you wanted. You could use the images in simple games or print them out on stickers via a Game Boy Printer.But a few developers had something a bit more nefarious in mind, according to a new documentary about the game ""Perfect Dark."" That bestselling Nintendo 64 shooter was a successor to ""Goldeneye"" and made by many of the same people, but it featured more advanced gameplay -- including a curious Game Boy Camera feature that was cut from the final product.An unreleased version of the game let you use the camera to snap pictures of your friends, transfer those images to the N64 and superimpose their faces on in-game characters. Then, you could shoot and kill those characters. ""That was really cutting-edge stuff at the time, which never ended up in the final game, unfortunately,"" Mark Edmonds, team lead of ""Perfect Dark,"" says in the documentary.You can imagine why not: ""Perfect Dark"" came out one year after the massacre at Columbine High School and, at the time, a panic over violent video games was in full swing. Allowing young people to snap pictures of classmates for use in a first-person shooter seems like an obvious no-go.A 2000 report from GameSpot, a video game website, indicates that the feature was scrapped ""to avoid any controversy.""Developers in the documentary stop just short of saying that, though, and allude to privacy concerns that seem quaint in the era of smartphones.""We had no degree of control over what people would take pictures of, or who they would take pictures of, and how they would use them,"" Duncan Botwood, level designer for ""Perfect Dark,"" says. That might be true, but Game Boy Camera was a massive cartridge with a huge, round lens that jutted out of a chunky piece of bright plastic -- the sort of thing you'd probably notice if someone was close enough to take a picture of your face.

All of them offer a slew of options to improve your snapshots before you share them, but after testing a whole bunch, we've pinpointed one that'll work great for most smartphone owners.It's called Afterlight.Maybe you've heard of it. The app launched in 2012, so it's kind of a dinosaur. Still, it stands out for a few reasons: It's very straightforward, it does a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it lets you make everything from minor aesthetic tweaks to major image overhauls with a few simple taps.True, the same could be said of many photography apps, but we've yet to find another that balances complexity and usability so perfectly. A confused smartphone newbie could get something out of Afterlight, and so could a photo obsessive.The app offers a mountain of options, all of which you can take or leave. They operate on a simple ""slider"" system just like Instagram's. You can mess with the brightness of a photograph on a scale of -100 to 100, for example. Afterlight also packs a ton of filters that go well beyond what you'll see on Instagram -- you can edit their intensity, too.There are also some gimmicky -- but pretty cool -- film effects that can make your shots look like they were taken on a traditional analog camera. Add fake wear to the image or light leaks: Why not? That photo above was originally a pretty unremarkable shot of my fiancée's backyard in Atlanta -- I put a bunch of light-junk over it in Afterlight, and now it looks like Endor or something. See if you can spot the Ewoks.You can use Afterlight for minor tweaks, too. Most importantly, the app is just fun to use -- be careful not to get sucked into editing every shot you take. Unlike other apps, it doesn't make a constant effort to sell you something or connect to social networks you're not interested in.Afterlight is available on Android, iOS and Windows Phone.

The third jet is still awaiting an estimate, Los Angeles Airport Police said Tuesday.The vandals are suspected of pulling off the stunt sometime early Monday morning after cutting through a perimeter fence with a bolt cutter. Once inside, they entered the jets’ isolated, private hangar and went to work, leaving a series of letters and numbers on the sides, Officer Rob Pedregon told the Huffington Post.""Nothing specific. They weren't words,” he said of the markings. “We're still investigating. Of course, we take any kind of breach in security very serious.""The Van Nuys airport, located in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County, is considered one of the world's busiest general aviation airports, overseeing 238,000 takeoffs and landings annually according to its website. It further touts itself as having 24-hour security patrols.Despite its high ranking and security efforts, the incident comes about two years after a $2.3 million Learjet suffered $100,000 worth of damage from graffiti at the same airport, NBC LA reported.In that 2013 case, reportedly believed to be gang-related, the vandals wrote words like “Flame” on the side of the aircraft and “RIP.” No arrests were made in that case.Pedregon said they’re still working with the hangar’s leaseholder to obtain possible security video from Monday’s incident. They’ll also work with them on possibly improving their current security measures.“It’s not over because of this,” he said.The city’s police union president agrees.In a statement to NBC, Marshall McClain, President LA Airport Peace Officers Association (APOA) publicly pressed for improved airport security.“Despite expert recommendations, despite LA APOA's continued request for additional staffing and security enhancements the chief has refused to take serious actions to mitigate these continued security gaps,” he stated.Also on HuffPost:"
6,POLITICS,No One Was Indicted In The Tamir Rice Case. That Was The Plan All Along.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-indictment-tamir-rice_us_5681918ce4b0b958f65a19c5,The prosecutor made it abundantly clear he wanted the two cops to walk.,2015-12-29,"All along the grand-jury probe of the Tamir Rice shooting, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty offered clues as to the ""reasonableness"" of the boy's death.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the first time since Tamir Rice was shot and killed by the Cleveland police last year, the prosecutor in the case ran from the press.After announcing the grand jury's decision on Monday not to indict anyone in the 12-year-old's death, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty simply left and didn't take any questions.McGinty did acknowledge that the outcome ""will not cheer anyone,"" and offered a more-or-less correct view about what the law demands of police officers making split-second decisions when they fear for their lives.""It would be irresponsible and unreasonable if the law required a police officer to wait and see if the gun was real,"" McGinty said, in reference to the toy gun the 12-year-old held as officer Timothy Loehmann perceived a threat he felt left him no choice but to shoot.That constitutional standard has been with us since the Supreme Court decided Graham v. Connor 25 years ago, effectively ruling that cops can shoot you dead as long as their sense of self-preservation is ""reasonable"" in the face of your perceived dangerousness.And reasonable means a million nebulous things in the law that no amount of protesting or arguing or hashtags for justice will change unless the Supreme Court reverses course or clarifies things. That won't be happening anytime soon.But this specific constitutional nuance shouldn't have mattered to McGinty, whose job before the grand jury wasn't to seek Loehmann's absolution. His only role before the grand jury, in this case and all other cases, was to present enough evidence to justify a prosecution by the state -- to get the wheels of justice rolling, so to speak.That's a very low bar. So low that Justice Antonin Scalia once explained that he and his colleagues refused time and again to micromanage prosecutors because they were unwilling to ""alter the grand jury's historical role, transforming it from an accusatory to an adjudicatory body.""Because in the end, all prosecutors and grand jurors do is accuse. If the war on drugs has taught us anything, it's that prosecutors are very good at convincing grand juries that a criminal case is warranted, even on the flimsiest of evidence.A judge concluded as much in June when he found that there was probable cause to prosecute Loehmann and his partner Frank Garmback. That's really all there is to it.But somewhere along the way, McGinty decided to go beyond his role, resorting to tactics not even the prosecutors in the probes of the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases dared attempt.Not only did he decide to talk to the press. Ahead of Monday's announcement, he also released report after report to the media -- lengthy experts' accounts rife with legalese that tried to exonerate Loehmann and Garmback of any wrongdoing.""Officer Loehmann’s belief that Rice posed a threat of serious physical harm or death was objectively reasonable as was his response to that perceived threat,"" read one of them.And in case any doubt remained about his commitment to the officers' cause, McGinty released a third report in November, complete with a frame-by-frame analysis of the shooting. The conclusion there was even more dramatic.""This unquestionably was a tragic loss of life, but to compound the tragedy by labeling the officer's conduct as anything but objectively reasonable would also be a tragedy, albeit not carrying with it the consequences of the loss of life, only the possibility of loss of career,"" the report said.No wonder the Rice family wasn't the least bit surprised with Monday's outcome. ""It has been clear for months that Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty was abusing and manipulating the grand jury process to orchestrate a vote against indictment,"" the family said Monday through its attorneys.Even the Department of Justice, in its own investigation of systemic problems within the Cleveland Police Department, couldn't seem to stomach how officials there investigated police brutality cases with an eye toward finding no wrongdoing from their own.""Deeply troubling to us,"" DOJ lawyers wrote last December, ""was that some of the specially-trained investigators who are charged with conducting unbiased reviews of officers’ use of deadly force admitted to us that they conduct their investigations with the goal of casting the accused officer in the most positive light possible.""Indeed, that's precisely the treatment McGinty gave Loehmann and Garmback ahead of Monday's outcome. The prosecutor did not take any questions from the press, but he really didn't have to; he had already said all he wanted to."

In an interview on WOR 710 in New York, the mayor said Trump is a ""blowhard"" who is saying things ""that play right into ISIS's hands.""Trump, a native New Yorker, didn't appreciate the mayor's remarks, as he made clear on Twitter.In 2013, Trump actually predicted de Blasio would ""end up being a good mayor, maybe a very good mayor.""De Blasio went back on that radio show Tuesday and said his earlier comments were not the best choice of words.""I realized that day -- and I remember that interview well -- that that was really the wrong term to use, and it minimized the danger of what he's saying. And I quickly realized I had to change my language and start saying that what he’s doing is dangerous. And a lot of other voices have come to the same conclusion,"" de Blasio said.""He has systematically affronted one group after another -- women, Mexican-Americans, Muslims -- and then he started to say things that are positively un-American, like having Muslims on a list and not allowing people into the country based on a religion test,"" he added.In early December, Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" following deadly terror attacks involving Islamic extremists in California and France.""He's now become dangerous, but I also think more and more people, including a lot of Republicans, are very, very concerned about what he's saying, and more and more people are speaking out against it,"" de Blasio concluded.The feud between de Blasio and Trump has been going on for months. This summer, de Blasio went after Trump for disparaging undocumented immigration and questioning the military service of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. De Blasio said the city was reviewing its contracts with the real estate developer and wouldn't do any more business with him (which may not actually be possible). De Blasio is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president.Also on HuffPost:"

We can excuse you if you have not read a book or two in a while, but the person we hire will be a newspaper reader. We are convinced that in order to be a respectable reporter, you must be informed.Hammes compared his situation to that of a vegetable farmer: ""Some people don't like spinach. Some people do. But if you're in the business, you better like your spinach.""""Don't be a reporter and not care about current events,"" he said.The listing, posted Dec. 17 on JournalismJobs.com, is honest from start to finish, including about the small-town feel of St. Maries, a quiet logging town about 150 miles from the Canadian border with a population of about 2,800.So ... let's get the info about the community out of the way.

It sheds new light on how the group is trying to reinterpret centuries-old teachings to justify the sexual slavery of women in the swaths of Syria and Iraq it controls.To read the fatwa, click here.The fatwa was among a huge trove of documents captured by U.S. Special Operations Forces during a raid targeting a top Islamic State official in Syria in May. Reuters has reviewed some of the documents, which have not been previously published.Among the religious rulings are bans on a father and son having sex with the same female slave; and the owner of a mother and daughter having sex with both. Joint owners of a female captive are similarly enjoined from intercourse because she is viewed as ""part of a joint ownership.""The United Nations and human rights groups have accused the Islamic State of the systematic abduction and rape of thousands of women and girls as young as 12, especially members of the Yazidi minority in northern Iraq. Many have been given to fighters as a reward or sold as sex slaves.Far from trying to conceal the practice, Islamic State has boasted about it and established a department of ""war spoils"" to manage slavery. Reuters reported on the existence of the department on Monday.In an April report, Human Rights Watch interviewed 20 female escapees who recounted how Islamic State fighters separated young women and girls from men and boys and older women. They were moved ""in an organized and methodical fashion to various places in Iraq and Syria."" They were then sold or given as gifts and repeatedly raped or subjected to sexual violence.DOS AND DON'TSFatwa No. 64, dated Jan. 29, 2015, and issued by Islamic State's Committee of Research and Fatwas, appears to codify sexual relations between IS fighters and their female captives for the first time, going further than a pamphlet issued by the group in 2014 on how to treat slaves.The fatwa starts with a question: ""Some of the brothers have committed violations in the matter of the treatment of the female slaves. These violations are not permitted by Sharia law because these rules have not been dealt with in ages. Are there any warnings pertaining to this matter?""It then lists 15 injunctions, which in some instances go into explicit detail. For example:""If the owner of a female captive, who has a daughter suitable for intercourse, has sexual relations with the latter, he is not permitted to have intercourse with her mother and she is permanently off limits to him. Should he have intercourse with her mother then he is not permitted to have intercourse with her daughter and she is to be off limits to him.""Islamic State's sexual exploitation of female captives has been well documented, but a leading IS expert at Princeton University, Cole Bunzel, who has reviewed many of the group's writings, said the fatwa went beyond what has previously been published by the militants on how to treat female slaves.""It reveals the actual concerns of IS slave owners,"" he said in an email.Still, he cautioned that not ""everything dealt with in the fatwa is indicative of a relevant violation. It doesn't mean father and son were necessarily sharing a girl. They're at least being 'warned' not to. But I bet some of these violations were being committed.""The fatwa also instructs owners of female slaves to ""show compassion towards her, be kind to her, not humiliate her, and not assign her work she is unable to perform."" An owner should also not sell her to an individual whom he knows will mistreat her.Professor Abdel Fattah Alawari, dean of Islamic Theology at Al-Azhar University, a 1,000-year-old Egyptian center for Islamic learning, said Islamic State ""has nothing to do with Islam"" and was deliberately misreading centuries-old verses and sayings that were originally designed to end, rather than encourage, slavery.""Islam preaches freedom to slaves, not slavery. Slavery was the status quo when Islam came around,"" he said. ""Judaism, Christianity, Greek, Roman, and Persian civilizations all practiced it and took the females of their enemies as sex slaves. So Islam found this abhorrent practice and worked to gradually remove it.”In September 2014 more than 120 Islamic scholars from around the world issued an open letter to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi refuting the group's religious arguments to justify many of its actions. The scholars noted that the ""reintroduction of slavery is forbidden in Islam.""Earlier On HuffPost:"

She is also the first college student council president to publicly reveal her sexual orientation in South Korea, a traditionally conservative country.

In a survey conducted by South Korea’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies in 2014, only 23.7 percent of respondents said they had no reservations about homosexuality. Although the figure points to an enduring intolerance to same-sex relationships, it shows an increase in public support, up from 15.8 percent in 2010. Respondents supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage also increased, from 16.9 percent in 2010 to 28.5 percent in 2014.

How’s it been so far?We're just getting past the handover stage and are now tackling various issues related to school.You also served as the student council vice president last year, which in itself must've been pretty hard work. What prompted you to run for student council president?I learned a lot as the vice president, and in the process became increasingly interested in the work and in implementing policies that would reflect my personal viewpoints more accurately. I started on this path as the department representative, then college representative, then student council VP and now the president. Basically, I've done everything I could to represent the interests of my peers, and I guess this is a way for me to finish out my tenure having tried everything.Was there a specific reason you decided to come out during the elections?I felt I had to be more candid about myself if I were going to be the student council president, which is a pretty public position. Also, I knew that my past experiences were going to be reflected in the policies I propose, that being the person I am was going to have an impact. I am aware that people often wondered, ""Why is she so interested in human rights, always proposing policies about minority groups and championing various causes and human rights?"" After the elections, I heard some people making the comment that the ""pieces of the puzzle now clicked."" What I did was basically reply ""Why not?"" to those who asked ""Why do you have to come out?""So your decision to come out wasn't as much personal as it was your way of declaring the direction you foresee for SNU's student council?Our campaign slogan was ""Moving As One Towards Diversity,"" a call for a society free of discrimination, hatred and violence, one that's understanding and accepting of different people, a society in which you don't have to be uncomfortable or embarrassed about yourself or your differences.Tell us about some of the new policies you’re proposing. First, further democratization of our school. All our policies are geared toward establishing the rights of various groups and individuals. Our aim is to establish a platform composed of various parties that will result in increased student participation in school governance.Second, there's diversity. Not merely a declaration, but a set of agreed-upon rules along the lines of a ""SNU Human Rights Guideline."" We want to have a serious discussion with the school administration about that point. We also want to propose a course on social responsibility -- on observing one's own as well as other people’s rights -- as part of our curriculum. We also plan to protest the toll that the reserve duty exacts on academia and university students. You're the first sexual minority university student council president. What's the implication of this? My hope is that many people in many different places are encouraged to be bold. They shouldn't be pressured, but I hope people from all walks of life can publicly come out. In the U.S., for example, except for some celebrities who have to guard their identity, coming out for most people is now almost commonplace. I hope to do my small part in helping to make such a society possible, to give courage to those in need.Actually (rather than on coming out) I wish the fact that this was the first time in 18 years that the student council election ended without a runoff got more attention. It was an election that all SNU students partook in. Students with disabilities, gays, seniors, juniors, everybody got one vote and of those, 80 percent agreed with our hopes for the school. How are you different from a straight student council president?The fact that I've experienced life as part of a minority group, I think, is an advantage and strong point because it means I have a bigger capacity to understand the plight of others. But that can also mean more of a burden.I'm sure there are those who are just waiting for me to fail, but then there are those who are rooting for me as well. I want to make sure that next year is very productive. I have to. There's so much that’s expected of me. I really have my work cut out for me. It’s been about a month since you came out in public. How has your life changed?Personally, it's given me more freedom. I no longer get awkward hetero-skewed questions, which means I don't have to wrack my brain for more lies. For example, I don't have to answer ""yes"" when people ask if I have a boyfriend just to get them off my back.Can you tell me a little more about the actual coming out process?To come out to the public at large, I think, takes quite a bit of courage. You worry about how you're going to deal with people in your vicinity. For three months, I ran simulations on how different scenarios would play out. I agonized over it, and I also sought advice from my closest friends. Honestly, in the past, I didn't even consider it, what with the backlash and how it might negatively impact my future and career. You know, because, we've come a long way but Korea still has a long way to go as a society in these matters. What were you most conflicted about in making the fateful decision?Family. That was the most difficult aspect. My siblings were OK with it but I was very worried about how my parents would take it. You see, all my family and relations and acquaintances knew I was running for the student council president position. Personal attacks I could endure, since it was my own decision, but I worried about what unforeseen consequences people I knew and loved, especially my parents, might suffer. So how did you finally approach your parents?Four days before coming out, I wrote a four-page letter to my parents. I didn't have the courage to do it face to face. I wrote about when I first felt it, how lonely I've felt since then, how terrible it had been for me, how some times have been pleasant but difficult. I explained that I'd asked myself if I could become straight and even gave it a try without success, that I had accepted who I was and that I was now very content with myself. I told them it wasn't their fault and begged for their understanding. ... They’re not yet at the understanding level, but I think they have accepted me for who I am. It takes a long time to work through that kind of stuff, and I really haven't given them quite enough time. It's been 10 years for me but only a month for my parents.Do you think there's been a change of perception in Korean society in the past decade about sexual minorities?Around the time I started college, I asked my friend from high school about same-sex relationships. At the time, the friend said, ""That seems unnatural."" That friend recently sent me a text message, saying: ""Wow! You're famous!"" I wrote back: ""I'm surprised you wrote. I thought you'd given up on me."" Then came the reply: ""I didn't know any better then."" That's a great first-hand example of seeing those around me change.Underlying many comments on articles about sexual minorities is an opinion along these lines: ""I accept that it's a personal thing but you can't force one to be in favor of it. One has the right not to like it."" Is there something you want to say about this?In the first place, if you really respect individual freedom, that kind of comment isn't even necessary. There's no respect in that kind of sentiment. If a person can't see that, I would not hesitate ending that friendship. You can't force it. You just have to accept that a relationship or friendship with that person wasn't meant to be. Some of my friends who really cannot make sense of my homosexuality still say, ""I will pray for you."" I thank them because although they can't support my sexual orientation, they're doing what they can in their own way. I'm not going to change because of their prayers, but at least they're respecting me and my decision.Is there something you want to say to those who despise people who have same-sex relationships?I'm sure people disparage it all the time, but do they consider that there may be a friend or an acquaintance who might be gay? Do they consider how every word, every comment might be a thorn in that friend's side, how such comments might be reflected in their own relationship? I hope people will consider these things.Lastly, please say a word to those who have supported and encouraged you.I'm very grateful. I don't know how to put it properly, but every bit helps. In fact, it's a huge help. Your love and support fuel my conviction and faith in myself, for having one's words and actions deemed meaningful is paramount. Your support also helps raise my self-esteem and hopes for a better future.This story first appeared on HuffPost Korea. It has been translated into English and edited for clarity. "
11,THE WORLDPOST,U.S. Security Aid To Mexico Dwindles Amid Human Rights Abuses,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-security-human-rights_us_5681c198e4b0b958f65a3e4b,"The missing 43 students and escape of ""El Chapo"" Guzmán may partly explain why the U.S. is slashing aid to Mexico.",2015-12-29,"Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in Mexico City to protest the disappearance of 43 students from a rural teachers college in on Oct. 22, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States is slowing the pace of security aid to Mexico amid an ongoing human rights disaster that led the State Department to withhold some $5 million in aid earlier this year.The budget Congress approved earlier this month awards roughly $146 million in security aid to Mexico. That figure is the lowest since 2011 and amounts to about three-quarters of the funding Congress authorized last year.“For a close country like Mexico, if their aid for a program is cut off 25 percent, that’s a pretty huge deal,” said Robert Naiman, policy director of the membership organization Just Foreign Policy. “By Washington’s standards, that’s a pretty big slap on the wrist.”Money from the Department of Defense to help fight drug trafficking appears to be dwindling, too. In 2014, the DOD doled out some $45 million in military assistance, down from $63 million the year before.The Pentagon hasn’t publicized the complete figures for last year or the projections for this year. But a biannual DOD report that tracks counter-narcotics funds, published in April and posted online by the Washington Office on Latin America, showed that Mexico had only received $6.8 million midway through 2015. Although the bulk of the money usually gets distributed in the second half of the year, Mexico appeared on course to receive less money than it did in 2014.It remains unclear what will happen in 2016, since the DOD reassigns its spending priorities every year, according to Frank Mora, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere from 2009 to 2013.“[The law] gives them broad authority to fund and to support Mexico in its counter-narcotics efforts,” Mora told The Huffington Post.The State Department, Defense Department and White House did not reply to requests for comment from HuffPost. Yet experts on Mexico pointed to a number of reasons why aid to the country is petering out. For one, the Mexican military has always been cautious about working too closely with the U.S., and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has shown less enthusiasm for collaboration than his predecessor, Felipe Calderón. The diminishing importance of the Merida Initiative, a security pact launched in 2008 to bolster Mexico’s assault on its drug cartels, has also led to a drop in funding. Congress has authorized some $2.5 billion for Mexico since Merida went into effect. Yet while the initiative originally helped fund large purchases of equipment for Mexico's military and police, it has focused more on training and professionalizing Mexican security forces in recent years.However, some experts also believe human rights concerns and a lack of faith in Mexico’s military have played at least some role in the budget cuts. Human rights organizations have documented widespread abuses by Mexico’s military and police, including forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and torture. Abusers are rarely punished. More than 100,000 people have died since Calderón launched his assault on the cartels in 2006, often at the hands of Mexico’s military and police. The Mexican government faced more criticism over its disastrous human rights record this year because Peña Nieto's administration has been accused of mishandling the investigation into the disappearance of 43 students at the hands of police in Iguala, Mexico. Independent journalists, forensic experts and a panel of experts fielded by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have all rejected the government’s account of what happened to the students, and government documents indicate that Mexican authorities tortured key witnesses in the case, including four people who prosecutors say confessed to killing the students.The escape this summer of the country’s most notorious drug kingpin, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, in apparent collusion with prison authorities, also undermined confidence in the Mexican government.American officials almost never criticize their Mexican counterparts publicly, partly out of concern for alienating a strategic ally with whom the U.S. shares a 2,000-mile border.The drop in support to Mexico would almost certainly be more dramatic if it weren't for a sharp uptick in the number of Central American mothers and children crossing into the U.S. in recent years. Congress authorized an extra $79 million above the White House's request in 2014 to crack down on illegal crossings through Mexico’s borders with Guatemala and Belize. The 2016 budget once again tops the White House request -- this time, by some $24 million -- partly because it includes funds to secure Mexico’s southern border.Yet the State Department declined to issue a report this year on the progress that Mexico has made on human rights, a requirement for disbursing 15 percent of the funding Mexico receives under the Merida Initiative. The decision only cost Mexico $5 million, according to The Washington Post, but came across as a rebuke.Adam Isacson, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America who tracks foreign aid to Mexico, said human rights scandals this year have made U.S. officials more cautious about who receives the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid to the country.“The human rights issue is a shadow hanging over U.S. cooperation with Mexican police and military forces,” Isacson told HuffPost.Shannon O’Neil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who researches Mexico, offered a similar assessment. Yet she added that officials and legislators would continue to cooperate with the Peña Nieto government to maintain influence and pressure Mexico to keep cracking down on its southern border, an issue that has gained attention as the U.S. heads into a presidential election.“I do think the challenges there have made it more difficult to support Mexico,” O’Neil told HuffPost. “Do you pull back all funding or do you see this as an opportunity to actually invest and create change?”Also on HuffPost: "
12,MEDIA,Islamic Militants Are The World’s Leading Killers Of Journalists,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/islamic-militants-journalists_us_568028f2e4b06fa688805b5c,France ranked as the second-deadliest country for the press in 2015.,2015-12-29,A memorial outside Charle Hebdo's Paris office in January 2015. A new report by the Committee to Protect Journalists ranks the deadliest countries for journalists this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Islamic militants hailing from groups such as Al Qaeda and the self-described Islamic State killed 28 journalists in 2015, according to a report released Tuesday by the Committee to Protect Journalists. That tally represents 40 percent of the total 69 journalists killed worldwide this past year.CPJ Editorial Director Elana Beiser, who authored the report, wrote that the press advocacy organization is still investigating at least 24 additional killings and acknowledged the difficulty of confirming reports from Libya, Yemen and Iraq. Earlier this year, CPJ visited Iraq to investigate reports of as many as 35 journalists who were ""missing, dead or held captive"" in Mosul, an Iraqi city controlled by militants from the Islamic State, or ISIS. ""With the militant group’s stranglehold on information about the city, CPJ could confirm the deaths of only a handful,"" Beiser wrote. ""Region-wide, CPJ has received reports of dozens more journalists killed, but is unable to independently confirm that the individuals have in fact died and, if so, whether journalistic work was the reason. Several of these journalists can be found on CPJ’s 'missing' list.""Though many major news organizations have stopped sending journalists to Syria, the war-ravaged country remained the deadliest for the fourth consecutive year, with 13 deaths. Countries that are active war zones, like Syria, or led by regimes opposed to a free press typically top CPJ's annual list. However, France surprisingly ranked second in 2015 as a result of the November terrorist attacks in Paris and the January attack on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hedbo. Eight journalists were killed in the January massacre, and one was killed in November while covering the Eagles of Death Metal concert at the Bataclan Theater, where attackers went on a shooting rampage.The Islamic State's savage treatment of journalists has been witnessed before, with militants beheading several last year and disseminating videos of the killings for propaganda purposes. But Sherif Mansour, CPJ's program coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, said in an interview that militants in 2015 were also ""crossing borders and ... delivering on their threats beyond their sphere of influence.""That happened not only in France, but also in Turkey. In October, Islamic State militants killed two Syrian journalists in Urfa, Turkey, one of whom was a member of ""Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently,"" an anti-Islamic State citizen journalist collective that has bravely covered everything from air strikes to the brutality of daily life inside the terrorist group’s Syrian stronghold.On Sunday, unknown assailants in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed Naji Jerf, an editor and documentary filmmaker who chronicled the Islamic State's atrocities. CPJ is still investigating the circumstances surrounding Jerf's death, and so his case was not included in the year-end report published Tuesday. In response to the recent killings, Mansour said he has been ""getting a lot of frantic emails"" from journalists in Turkey, some of whom he doesn't consider safe in that country. In an interview, Mansour said the Islamic State's strength in using social media for recruiting and propaganda purposes ""is also their weakness,"" given that groups like Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently can similarly harness such platforms to amplify the horrors of life under the terrorists' rule. He said that's why militants have specifically targeted members of the journalism organization, which CPJ honored last month with its International Press Freedom Award.Islamic extremists also killed journalists in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Somalia this past year, according to the report. In addition to 69 journalists who were killed, CPJ's report noted that governments have also jailed 110 -- of 199 total -- on charges of supporting terrorism or crimes against the state. The press worldwide, the report says, ""is being squeezed by terrorists on the one hand and by authorities purporting to fight terror on the other."""

""But I respect the verdict of the Supreme Court justices.""Tel Aviv District Court found Olmert guilty in March 2014 of two bribery charges, finding that he accepted 500,000 shekels from developers of the Holyland project and 60,000 shekels in a separate real estate deal.The six-year sentence handed down by the lower court had been put on hold until the culmination of the appeal.Issuing its ruling, a five-member Supreme Court panel said it had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Olmert had solicited the 500,000 shekels from a real estate developer, to help the veteran politician's brother get out of debt. It upheld his conviction on accepting the smaller amount.A lawyer by profession, Olmert began his political career in the 1970s as a lawmaker who targeted organized crime in Israel. As the country's leader, Olmert waged war against militants in Lebanon in 2006 and the Gaza Strip in 2008.He claimed significant progress in talks with the Palestinians aimed at security a final peace deal, offering an Israeli withdrawal from much of the occupied West Bank. But no agreement was reached.Olmert is expected to serve his term, separated off from most other prisoners, in the same jail holding former Israeli President Moshe Katzav. Katzav was convicted of rape charges in 2010 and sentenced to seven years.Earlier On HuffPost:"

Sly, in the report, says that he worked at the Guyer Institute, the Indianapolis clinic in question, in 2011. Then a member of the Indianapolis Colts, Manning missed the 2011 season while recovering from multiple neck surgeries, and visited the clinic as part of his recovery.Sly has since recanted his allegations, and Dr. Dale Guyer, the clinic's founder and owner, says that Sly was only an intern at the clinic, and didn't work there until 2013. Al Jazeera, however, said in the report that it confirmed Sly's employment dates, and is standing behind the timelines in its news special that Sly worked at the clinic during the time that Manning was being treated there. The network provided The Huffington Post with transcripts of its call to the clinic about Sly in response to questions about how they confirmed his employment.In the transcripts, an employee of the Guyer Institute tells Al Jazeera reporter Deborah Davies that Sly worked at the clinic in the ""fall of 2011."" The employee confirmed his start date as Oct. 17 of that year.Here is the full transcript, according to Al Jazeera:(Phone rings)Reached by phone, an employee of the Guyer Institute directed inquiries to Guyer's legal counsel, who has yet to respond to HuffPost.The start date of Sly's internship in Al Jazeera's transcript conflicts with the account that Guyer provided in his official statement and to other reporters.“I would emphasize that Mr. Sly was never an employee of the Guyer Institute and his brief three-month internship occurred in 2013 during which time Peyton was not even being treated or present in the office,"" Guyer told MMQB's Peter King on Sunday.""Mr. Sly began his unpaid student internship with us on February 18th, 2013,"" he continued.Manning, meanwhile, denied the Al Jazeera report's allegations in an interview with ESPN on Sunday, calling it ""complete trash."" When ESPN asked whether his wife, Ashley, received HGH or other drugs from the Guyer Institute, Manning said: ""Any medical treatments that my wife received, that’s her business. That has nothing to do with me. Nothing that's been sent to her or [that] my wife has used have I ever taken. Absolutely not. I have my treatments that I do, she may have hers and that is her business. There's no connection between the two."""

It looked like he was injured,” Piotrowski tells his viewers while turning his vehicle around.“Are you hurt, are you OK?"" he’s heard repeatedly asking after pulling up to the man.""I need to speak to an attorney, please,” the man calmly replies off camera. “An attorney!"" he shouts when Piotrowski questions him.Some kind of tussle ensues in his car before the unidentified man is heard saying, ""This is some bulls—t dude.""In an interview with the New York Daily News, Piotrowski claims the man lunged into his vehicle from his driver-side window and grabbed his throat. He consequently stepped on the gas, momentarily leaving the suspect hanging onto his truck.""This guy tried to attack me with a knife!"" he’s next heard screaming in the video.“He almost got me. Almost stabbed me in the chest,” he says while racing down the road in pursuit of a police officer up ahead.After pointing an officer in the man’s direction, Piotrowski resumes his course along State Highway 78. Shock then turns to anger.“Stop to help somebody and they stab you,” he fumes. “In 35 years of chasing, I’ve never had anybody try to freakin’ stab me after a freakin’ tornado. I’m mad as Hell. I wish I had my gun; I woulda shot his ass. This is ridiculous.”Piotrowski described the man as appearing “wide eyed, like he was wiped out on drugs or something.“In a message to his fans on Twitter after, he assured them that he was OK though a little banged up.""I was attacked tonight I'm ok the guy was trying to kill me. I hurt my arms from fighting him off of me. [I'm] glad I'm alive,” he posted. Several hours later he announced that a Collin County Deputy had arrested “the thug” responsible.The suspect has yet to be identified by the sheriff’s department. A request for comment was not immediately returned.Piotrowski’s fans are meanwhile expressing sighs of relief, including some who claim they witnessed the attack as it unfolded.""I was watching LIVE!! I was So Scared for you. I'm so glad your ok & safe. It was Horrible!!"" @tamara710 posted.""Glad you are OK. We almost witnessed your murder on periscope. You have very clear pictures of him for the police,"" Debbie Fenelon tweeted.Also on HuffPost:"
19,POLITICS,The Endangered Species Act Has Been Protecting Imperiled Animals And Plants For 42 Years,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/endangered-species-act-turns-42_us_568173ade4b06fa68880ae0f,"Signed by Richard Nixon on Dec. 28, 1975, the act now protects more than 2,000 species worldwide.",2015-12-28,The two primary subspecies of the African lion were added to the ESA's protected list earlier this month.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Endangered Species Act turned 42 on Monday, marking over four decades of plant and animal conservation in the United States.The act was signed into law on Dec. 28, 1973 by President Richard Nixon, who had urged Congress to expand the protection of imperiled species. Under the ESA, species deemed in danger of extinction qualify for strict protections, including bans or limitations on imports and hunting, as well as severe penalties for violation.""Nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed,"" Nixon said after the law's passage. ""It is a many-faceted treasure, of value to scholars, scientists, and nature lovers alike, and it forms a vital part of the heritage we all share as Americans.""There are now around 2,215 species listed as endangered or threatened under the act, including 650 found outside of the United States.The most recent additions to the ESA, made earlier this month, were the two primary subspecies of the African lion, one of which is listed as ""endangered"" and the other as ""threatened."" The big cats' population numbers have plummeted to just half of what they were in 1993, with fewer than 20,000 remaining. The protections came after years of lobbying by conservation organizations and scientists, who warn that the animals could see a further 50 percent decline by 2050 without intervention.Other species have fared well under the ESA's increased protections, such as the whitebark pine. The tree, which grows slowly and can live for more than a thousand years, has been devastated by climate change and an increase in mountain pine beetles. But Fish and Wildlife lowered the tree's protection priority earlier this month as the threat from insects has declined.The ESA has been controversial in recent years, and the listing of some species has stalled due to partisan politics. For years, advocates called for the protection of the greater sage grouse, a bird resembling a turkey that lives in 11 Western states. Its habitat has been severely disrupted by oil and gas drilling, but some Republicans fought against a protection plan that they argued would have put those activities in jeopardy.Eventually, the Obama administration decided to protect the sage grouse without ESA listing.Republicans also called for a revamp of the law earlier this year, arguing that few listed species actually recover despite the massive government spending on them. But advocates have responded by pointing to examples such as the gray whale and the bald eagle, both of which have made notable recoveries.Despite the objections, the Obama administration still seems interested in using the act to protect species that are most in need. There are 60 other species currently listed as candidates for ESA protection. Also on HuffPost:"
