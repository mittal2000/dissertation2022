0,EDUCATION,Expanding Opportunity for AAPI Communities Through Education,"Chris Lu, ContributorU.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/expanding-opportunity-for_b_5354069.html,"As with every other race, obtaining a college degree means facing lower rates of unemployment. For AAPIs, having a college education means shaving nearly 2 percentage points off the unemployment rate compared to AAPIs with only a high school education.",2014-05-19,2014-05-19-CollegegraduatesamongAsianethnicities.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-19-CollegegraduatesamongAsianethnicities-thumb.png,"For Asian-American families, there is nothing more valued than education. As we celebrate Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month, it is important to reflect on where our communities stand on educational achievement and where we can improve.In 2010, President Obama made a commitment to double the number of college graduates by 2020 because he understood that a post-secondary education is essential to preparing Americans for the jobs of the future. As the employment report for April 2014 showed, the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor degree or higher was 3.3 percent, nearly half the rate of someone with only a high school education (6.3 percent). Over the next decade, the number of jobs that require more than a high school diploma will increase significantly faster than jobs that require only a high school diploma.According to new data compiled by the Labor Department for 2013, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders overall have done well in obtaining a college education, with over 53.4 percent of their population holding a bachelor degree or higher. This is substantially higher than the next closest group, whites, where 31.9 percent have a college degree. As with every other race, obtaining a college degree means facing lower rates of unemployment. For AAPIs, having a college education means shaving nearly 2 percentage points off the unemployment rate compared to AAPIs with only a high school education.  While the overall educational attainment rate is high, AAPIs are not a monolithic group, and wide disparities exist among different subgroups. Indian-Americans have the highest rate of college graduates (76.1 percent), followed by Korean-Americans (58.7 percent) and Chinese-Americans (56.8 percent), while Vietnamese-Americans trailed significantly with only 29.5 percent holding a college degree. Of particular concern are Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, among whom only 26.5 percent have a college degree and nearly one-third have only a high school education.This disparity in educational attainment rates should serve as a call to action. Even though the AAPI community as a whole is prospering, what can we do to ensure that everyone in our community is able to access the American Dream?Here at the Labor Department, we are committing significant funds this year to offer job training services that lead toward an associate or bachelor's degree, including $450 million in funds as part of the next round of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program. We're also working with Registered Apprenticeship sponsors and colleges to turn years of apprenticeship training into college credits. These are just a few of our programs that will help AAPIs advance their educational and employment goals.We also need to fix our broken immigration system to encourage more highly educated foreign-born workers to come to the United States. If we are to compete in a global economy, we must continue to attract and retain the world's brightest minds. Too many foreign students -- many from Asian countries -- come to the United States to further their education but must return home when they cannot obtain a green card or immigrant visa. As part of President Obama's immigration reforms, he has called for ""stapling green cards"" to the diplomas of foreign graduates students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.This month is an appropriate time to reflect on the accomplishments of the AAPI communities -- from earliest achievements of the Chinese Railroad Workers completing the nation's first transcontinental railroad to today's success in nearly every industry and aspect of American society. But we must continue working to make sure all members of our communities are able to succeed."

Of course, the subsequent sitcoms would perform with wildly varying degrees of success. Comedians would mostly play fictional versions of themselves with random professions (George Carlin played a taxi driver on The George Carlin Show).

Making Moscow his first foreign destination, Chinaâs new president urged Russia Friday to enhance foreign policy coordination in order to better protect joint security and interests, a call reflecting Beijingâs new assertiveness in the global arena. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1367f230000370093cc4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Fayen WongSHANGHAI, May 20 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes to sign a multi-billion dollar gas agreement with China during a two-day visit that kicks off on Tuesday, ending more than a decade of false starts and wrangling over a deal seen as vital to both sides.More broadly, the Russian leader, cold-shouldered in the West for his stance on Ukraine, can expect a warmer reception in China, itself increasingly assertive in territorial disputes with smaller neighbors in the South China Sea.The crisis in Ukraine, which has left European countries looking at ways to reduce dependency on Russian natural gas supplies, and Beijing's drive to switch from coal use to cleaner fuels, have created a convergence of interests.Analysts said that will be on display when Putin meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in Shanghai, although the success of his visit will rest in part on whether any energy agreement contains enough detail to take it beyond mere words.Chinese state media on Monday quoted Putin as saying that preparations for a gas deal had entered ""the final phase"".Negotiations in the past have collapsed over differences on pricing.Russia's state-controlled Gazprom said at the weekend that it was still ""one digit"" away from a deal.But on Monday, sources close to the company and in the gas industry said it wanted China to pay $25 billion now to secure future gas supplies, whereas China had so far been reticent, concerned that other suppliers would seek similar deals.""We are pinning our hopes on Putin's May visit,"" a source at Gazprom said.For its part, Beijing has been pushing to secure equity stakes in gas fields in eastern Siberia, which would be the main source of supply.The agreement that could be signed is a 30-year contract for Gazprom to supply China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) with 38 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per year.Should the deal be finalized this week, construction of a new pipeline is expected to begin by the end of 2014 and start delivering gas by 2018. CHINA, RUSSIA APART ON UKRAINEChina's Xi has underscored the importance of ties with Russia, and Moscow was the first capital he visited after assuming the presidency last year. Xi also attended the Winter Olympics in Sochi at Putin's invitation.But, while the two see eye-to-eye on many international diplomatic issues, including the conflict in Syria, and generally vote as one on the United Nations Security Council, China has not been so willing to support Russia on Ukraine.""Generally speaking, on the Ukraine issue we have taken an objective and just stance,"" Liu Guchang, a former Chinese ambassador to Russia and adviser to the foreign ministry, told Reuters. ""All peoples and parties have to be respected. But we have seen very clearly the reality of the situation.""Beijing has adopted a cautious response to the Ukraine crisis, not wanting to alienate a key ally.It has not commented directly on a referendum in which Crimea voted overwhelmingly to join Russia, lest it set a precedent for its own restive regions including Tibet.While in Shanghai, Putin will also meet U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Kiev holds a presidential election on Sunday, and in a move that could be intended to ease tensions in the region ahead of the vote, Putin ordered military forces to return to permanent bases after drills in three regions bordering Ukraine.Putin's office said he had issued the order because the spring maneuvers were over, but in Brussels, a NATO military officer said the military alliance had seen no sign of Russian troops returning to their bases.

6,GREEN,Applying Brainpower to Address the Global Sustainability Crisis,"Steven Cohen, ContributorExecutive Director, Columbia University's Earth Institute",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/applying-brainpower-to-ad_b_5351078.html,"We need to mobilize, on a war-like footing to save the planet and learn to produce enough goods and services to ensure environmentally sustainable economic growth.",2014-05-19,"SUN VALLEY, CA - DECEMBER 11: The Department of Water and Power (DWP) San Fernando Valley Generating Station is seen December 11, 2008 in Sun Valley, California.

The action would lead to the creation of a carbon-credit market to make it cheaper for the biggest polluters to cut emissions, and change the ways utilities generate power, businesses use electricity, and personal transportation (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb157433c000018010bc984.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The world faces an unprecedented global sustainability crisis. It is caused by climate change, the stress on the planet's ecosystems by developed economies, and the drive for economic growth in the developing world. While some choose to believe that the scientific analyses detailing the threats to our planet are inaccurate, common sense tells me that the world my children are experiencing is different from the one my generation found as we came of age. One simple fact: the planet had 3 billion people in the 1960s; today it has over seven billion. The planet's population has more than doubled in half a century. It defies logic to maintain that the planet's resources have been unaffected by growth.In seeking to protect their self-interest, fossil fuel magnates and other powers of the old economy have tried to use propaganda and political muscle to create their own distorted reality. That is an effort doomed to fail. Fossil fuel extraction damages ecosystems and fossil fuel use causes climate change and pollution. The degree of damage, when it will occur, and what we should do about it are debatable issues. The fact of damaging impacts is just that -- fact.In response to inaction by governments, many environmental advocates argue that we must immediately reduce the use of fossil fuels by banning or taxing them. That too is doomed to fail. While some nations may be capable of implementing rapid command and control reductions in fossil fuel use, energy is too central to modern economic life to expect that all large nations will do so. Unless the reductions are world-wide, they will be ineffective. We need to reduce our addiction to fossil fuels, but energy is too important to our way of life to just go cold turkey. We must replace our addiction to one form of energy with another form. The fossil fuel industry will collapse when reliable, low-cost alternatives are available in the marketplace. Until then, the planet will continue to cook.The key stresses on the planet's sustainability -- climate, food, water and toxicity -- must be better understood and better managed. One of the key goals of Columbia's Earth Institute is to conduct the research and teach the knowledge required to manage the planet's economy on a sustainable basis. I believe that the next generation's leaders will gradually add issues of planetary sustainability to the routine management of organizations, cities and nations. To some degree, this is a simple assertion or article of faith. Fortunately, it is more than that. Public opinion data tells us that younger people are more concerned about a sustainable planet than older people. At Columbia I see that change every day and find that student interest in protecting the planet is on a dramatic upward growth curve. This is happening all over America and all over the world.This is graduation week at Columbia University, and the campus plaza has been re-set with tents, bleachers, big screen TVs and happy soon-to-be graduates. At mid-week, thousands of students, families, friends, professors and staff will gather in school and university-wide ceremonies and celebrations. I direct two environmental sustainability master's programs at Columbia, and one of my jobs is to learn how to pronounce the names of my graduates, which I read as they cross the stage to shake hands with deans and receive the cheers of family and friends. It is a joyous time, and a moment to take stock of the hard work and accomplishments of our students.While universities seem to have an image problem these days, the on-the-ground view I can offer from one university is not likely to make the evening news. It is a world of hard work, struggle and accomplishment. Since I teach in two professional degree programs, I am fortunate to see people who have come to school to develop the skills they need to get ahead. They tend to be focused and ambitious. However, they are not alone in their concern for this planet. All the students I interact with at Columbia and elsewhere talk about environmental issues. When I started working in this field in 1975, environmental policy was a small, fringe issue. Today it is at the center of a global discussion. I think that the challenge of global sustainability is now part of the permanent agenda of concerns that young people have internalized. The people who have come to Columbia to study sustainability are incredibly dedicated and give me reason to hope. Colleagues at many other universities share my sense of hope. Again, it is not just those studying sustainability who care about the planet. Students in public policy, health, law, business, engineering, journalism, and pretty much every professional field I can think of, understand how the world has changed. As I practice the pronunciation of my students' names, I take note of their global diversity, and the fact that most are women. I think about the challenges they've overcome to obtain their degrees. The School of International and Public Affairs and the Earth Institute offer the MPA in Environmental Science and Policy. This program starts the day after Memorial Day, and requires that students enroll in eighteen graduate points each semester, starting with a summer dominated by environmental science courses designed for future policy makers. These students complete four semesters of graduate study in three semesters. It is a tough, demanding program, but one that is characterized by teamwork, incredible camaraderie and a profound sense of mission. Slightly more than 60 of those students will receive their degrees this week.The second program I am honored to lead is the Master of Science in Sustainability Management that is offered by the Earth Institute and Columbia's School of Continuing Education. This is a program designed for part-time students who mainly attend classes in the evening. Almost 70% of these students attend school part-time. In addition to meeting family responsibilities, many commute to their day job before taking the subway to campus for evening courses. After a long day of work and school they make their way home, often arriving after 10 p.m. -- just in time to get some rest before repeating the cycle the next day. They do their homework on the train and in whatever stolen moments they can grab.At the celebrations before and after graduation I meet the families and friends of these graduates and sense their pride and happiness. They are proud of our graduates' accomplishments, and are typically both happy and relieved that they will finally be able to see them again as normal life resumes. The time, money and sacrifice involved in these courses of study are quite extraordinary. Our students know that to be competitive in today's brain-based economy they must be life-long learners, and that requires both formal education and constant exposure to new ideas, enhanced skills and emerging technologies. The world they are making their way in is tougher, less certain, and less secure than the one that I found when I left graduate school.In the next month or so we will see these rites of passage celebrated throughout America. Over the doorway of my old high school in Brooklyn, my mind's eye will always see James Madison's words, as true today as ever: ""Education is the true foundation of civil liberty."" In the 18th century, Madison asked, how can we participate in democracy if we do not understand the facts, history and values of the modern world? Today, learning is even more essential if we are to understand and come to grips with the crisis of global sustainability. We are going to need to learn and think our way out of the crisis we have created. This will require a detailed knowledge of our planet's systems that we do not yet posses. It will require ever more sophisticated models of the impacts of human production and consumption.This means that massive resources must be devoted to earth observation, research and development of sustainability technology and a range of scientific, policy and management education programs. We need to mobilize, on a war-like footing to save the planet and learn to produce enough goods and services to ensure environmentally sustainable economic growth. I do not know if we are capable of managing the planet. I hope we are, because the alternative is slow deterioration of the civilization we have constructed. It's time to end the partisan bickering over symbolic nonsense and get started on the real work that lies before us."

That alliance is already a done deal in a variety of ways: through the BRICS group of emerging powers (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa); at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian counterweight to NATO; inside the G20; and via the 120-member-nation Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Trade and commerce are just part of the future bargain. Synergies in the development of new military technologies beckon as well. After Russia’s Star Wars-style, ultra-sophisticated S-500 air defense anti-missile system comes online in 2018, Beijing is sure to want a version of it. Meanwhile, Russia is about to sell dozens of state-of-the-art Sukhoi Su-35 jet fighters to the Chinese as Beijing and Moscow move to seal an aviation-industrial partnership.This week should provide the first real fireworks in the celebration of a new Eurasian century-in-the-making when Russian President Vladimir Putin drops in on Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. You remember “Pipelineistan,” all those crucial oil and gas pipelines crisscrossing Eurasia that make up the true circulatory system for the life of the region. Now, it looks like the ultimate Pipelineistan deal, worth $1 trillion and 10 years in the making, will be inked as well. In it, the giant, state-controlled Russian energy giant Gazprom will agree to supply the giant state-controlled China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) with 3.75 billion cubic feet of liquefied natural gas a day for no less than 30 years, starting in 2018. That’s the equivalent of a quarter of Russia’s massive gas exports to all of Europe. China’s current daily gas demand is around 16 billion cubic feet a day, and imports account for 31.6% of total consumption.Gazprom may still collect the bulk of its profits from Europe, but Asia could turn out to be its Everest. The company will use this mega-deal to boost investment in Eastern Siberia and the whole region will be reconfigured as a privileged gas hub for Japan and South Korea as well. If you want to know why no key country in Asia has been willing to “isolate” Russia in the midst of the Ukrainian crisis -- and in defiance of the Obama administration -- look no further than Pipelineistan.Exit the Petrodollar, Enter the Gas-o-YuanAnd then, talking about anxiety in Washington, there’s the fate of the petrodollar to consider, or rather the “thermonuclear” possibility that Moscow and Beijing will agree on payment for the Gazprom-CNPC deal not in petrodollars but in Chinese yuan. One can hardly imagine a more tectonic shift, with Pipelineistan intersecting with a growing Sino-Russian political-economic-energy partnership. Along with it goes the future possibility of a push, led again by China and Russia, toward a new international reserve currency -- actually a basket of currencies -- that would supersede the dollar (at least in the optimistic dreams of BRICS members).Right after the potentially game-changing Sino-Russian summit comes a BRICS summit in Brazil in July. That’s when a $100 billion BRICS development bank, announced in 2012, will officially be born as a potential alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank as a source of project financing for the developing world.More BRICS cooperation meant to bypass the dollar is reflected in the “Gas-o-yuan,” as in natural gas bought and paid for in Chinese currency. Gazprom is even considering marketing bonds in yuan as part of the financial planning for its expansion. Yuan-backed bonds are already trading in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and most recently Frankfurt.Nothing could be more sensible for the new Pipelineistan deal than to have it settled in yuan. Beijing would pay Gazprom in that currency (convertible into rubles); Gazprom would accumulate the yuan; and Russia would then buy myriad made-in-China goods and services in yuan convertible into rubles.It’s common knowledge that banks in Hong Kong, from Standard Chartered to HSBC -- as well as others closely linked to China via trade deals -- have been diversifying into the yuan, which implies that it could become one of the de facto global reserve currencies even before it’s fully convertible. (Beijing is unofficially working for a fully convertible yuan by 2018.)The Russia-China gas deal is inextricably tied up with the energy relationship between the European Union (EU) and Russia. After all, the bulk of Russia’s gross domestic product comes from oil and gas sales, as does much of its leverage in the Ukraine crisis. In turn, Germany depends on Russia for a hefty 30% of its natural gas supplies. Yet Washington’s geopolitical imperatives -- spiced up with Polish hysteria -- have meant pushing Brussels to find ways to “punish” Moscow in the future energy sphere (while not imperiling present day energy relationships).There’s a consistent rumble in Brussels these days about the possible cancellation of the projected 16 billion euro South Stream pipeline, whose construction is to start in June. On completion, it would pump yet more Russian natural gas to Europe -- in this case, underneath the Black Sea (bypassing Ukraine) to Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Greece, Italy, and Austria.Bulgaria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have already made it clear that they are firmly opposed to any cancellation. And cancellation is probably not in the cards. After all, the only obvious alternative is Caspian Sea gas from Azerbaijan, and that isn’t likely to happen unless the EU can suddenly muster the will and funds for a crash schedule to construct the fabled Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, conceived during the Clinton years expressly to bypass Russia and Iran.In any case, Azerbaijan doesn’t have enough capacity to supply the levels of natural gas needed, and other actors like Kazakhstan, plagued with infrastructure problems, or unreliable Turkmenistan, which prefers to sell its gas to China, are already largely out of the picture. And don’t forget that South Stream, coupled with subsidiary energy projects, will create a lot of jobs and investment in many of the most economically devastated EU nations.Nonetheless, such EU threats, however unrealistic, only serve to accelerate Russia’s increasing symbiosis with Asian markets. For Beijing especially, it’s a win-win situation. After all, between energy supplied across seas policed and controlled by the U.S. Navy and steady, stable land routes out of Siberia, it’s no contest.Pick Your Own Silk RoadOf course, the U.S. dollar remains the top global reserve currency, involving 33% of global foreign exchange holdings at the end of 2013, according to the IMF. It was, however, at 55% in 2000. Nobody knows the percentage in yuan (and Beijing isn’t talking), but the IMF notes that reserves in “other currencies” in emerging markets have been up 400% since 2003.The Fed is arguably monetizing 70% of the U.S. government debt in an attempt to keep interest rates from heading skywards. Pentagon adviser Jim Rickards, as well as every Hong Kong-based banker, tends to believe that the Fed is bust (though they won’t say it on the record). No one can even imagine the extent of the possible future deluge the U.S. dollar might experience amid a $1.4 trillion Mount Ararat of financial derivatives. Don’t think that this is the death knell of Western capitalism, however, just the faltering of that reigning economic faith, neoliberalism, still the official ideology of the United States, the overwhelming majority of the European Union, and parts of Asia and South America.As far as what might be called the “authoritarian neoliberalism” of the Middle Kingdom, what’s not to like at the moment? China has proven that there is a result-oriented alternative to the Western “democratic” capitalist model for nations aiming to be successful. It’s building not one, but myriad new Silk Roads, massive webs of high-speed railways, highways, pipelines, ports, and fiber optic networks across huge parts of Eurasia. These include a Southeast Asian road, a Central Asian road, an Indian Ocean “maritime highway” and even a high-speed rail line through Iran and Turkey reaching all the way to Germany.In April, when President Xi Jinping visited the city of Duisburg on the Rhine River, with the largest inland harbor in the world and right in the heartland of Germany’s Ruhr steel industry, he made an audacious proposal: a new “economic Silk Road” should be built between China and Europe, on the basis of the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe railway, which already runs from China to Kazakhstan, then through Russia, Belarus, Poland, and finally Germany. That’s 15 days by train, 20 less than for cargo ships sailing from China’s eastern seaboard. Now that would represent the ultimate geopolitical earthquake in terms of integrating economic growth across Eurasia.Keep in mind that, if no bubbles burst, China is about to become -- and remain -- the number one global economic power, a position it enjoyed for 18 of the past 20 centuries. But don’t tell London hagiographers; they still believe that U.S. hegemony will last, well, forever.Take Me to Cold War 2.0Despite recent serious financial struggles, the BRICS countries have been consciously working to become a counterforce to the original and -- having tossed Russia out in March -- once again Group of 7, or G7. They are eager to create a new global architecture to replace the one first imposed in the wake of World War II, and they see themselves as a potential challenge to the exceptionalist and unipolar world that Washington imagines for our future (with itself as the global robocop and NATO as its robo-police force). Historian and imperialist cheerleader Ian Morris, in his book War! What is it Good For?, defines the U.S. as the ultimate “globocop” and “the last best hope of Earth.” If that globocop “wearies of its role,” he writes, “there is no plan B.” Well, there is a plan BRICS -- or so the BRICS nations would like to think, at least. And when the BRICS do act in this spirit on the global stage, they quickly conjure up a curious mix of fear, hysteria, and pugnaciousness in the Washington establishment. Take Christopher Hill as an example. The former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and U.S. ambassador to Iraq is now an advisor with the Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm deeply connected to the White House and the State Department. When Russia was down and out, Hill used to dream of a hegemonic American “new world order.” Now that the ungrateful Russians have spurned what “the West has been offering” -- that is, “special status with NATO, a privileged relationship with the European Union, and partnership in international diplomatic endeavors” -- they are, in his view, busy trying to revive the Soviet empire. Translation: if you’re not our vassals, you’re against us. Welcome to Cold War 2.0. The Pentagon has its own version of this directed not so much at Russia as at China, which, its think tank on future warfare claims, is already at war with Washington in a number of ways. So if it’s not apocalypse now, it’s Armageddon tomorrow. And it goes without saying that whatever’s going wrong, as the Obama administration very publicly “pivots” to Asia and the American media fills with talk about a revival of Cold War-era “containment policy” in the Pacific, it’s all China’s fault.Embedded in the mad dash toward Cold War 2.0 are some ludicrous facts-on-the-ground: the U.S. government, with $17.5 trillion in national debt and counting, is contemplating a financial showdown with Russia, the largest global energy producer and a major nuclear power, just as it’s also promoting an economically unsustainable military encirclement of its largest creditor, China.Russia runs a sizeable trade surplus. Humongous Chinese banks will have no trouble helping Russian banks out if Western funds dry up. In terms of inter-BRICS cooperation, few projects beat a $30 billion oil pipeline in the planning stages that will stretch from Russia to India via Northwest China. Chinese companies are already eagerly discussing the possibility of taking part in the creation of a transport corridor from Russia into Crimea, as well as an airport, shipyard, and liquid natural gas terminal there. And there’s another “thermonuclear” gambit in the making: the birth of a natural gas equivalent to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that would include Russia, Iran, and reportedly disgruntled U.S. ally Qatar.The (unstated) BRICS long-term plan involves the creation of an alternative economic system featuring a basket of gold-backed currencies that would bypass the present America-centric global financial system. (No wonder Russia and China are amassing as much gold as they can.) The euro -- a sound currency backed by large liquid bond markets and huge gold reserves -- would be welcomed in as well.It’s no secret in Hong Kong that the Bank of China has been using a parallel SWIFT network to conduct every kind of trade with Tehran, which is under a heavy U.S. sanctions regime. With Washington wielding Visa and Mastercard as weapons in a growing Cold War-style economic campaign against Russia, Moscow is about to implement an alternative payment and credit card system not controlled by Western finance. An even easier route would be to adopt the Chinese Union Pay system, whose operations have already overtaken American Express in global volume. I’m Just Pivoting With MyselfNo amount of Obama administration “pivoting” to Asia to contain China (and threaten it with U.S. Navy control of the energy sea lanes to that country) is likely to push Beijing far from its Deng Xiaoping-inspired, self-described “peaceful development” strategy meant to turn it into a global powerhouse of trade. Nor are the forward deployment of U.S. or NATO troops in Eastern Europe or other such Cold-War-ish acts likely to deter Moscow from a careful balancing act: ensuring that Russia’s sphere of influence in Ukraine remains strong without compromising trade and commercial, as well as political, ties with the European Union -- above all, with strategic partner Germany. This is Moscow’s Holy Grail; a free-trade zone from Lisbon to Vladivostok, which (not by accident) is mirrored in China’s dream of a new Silk Road to Germany.Increasingly wary of Washington, Berlin for its part abhors the notion of Europe being caught in the grips of a Cold War 2.0. German leaders have more important fish to fry, including trying to stabilize a wobbly EU while warding off an economic collapse in southern and central Europe and the advance of ever more extreme rightwing parties.On the other side of the Atlantic, President Obama and his top officials show every sign of becoming entangled in their own pivoting -- to Iran, to China, to Russia’s eastern borderlands, and (under the radar) to Africa. The irony of all these military-first maneuvers is that they are actually helping Moscow, Tehran, and Beijing build up their own strategic depth in Eurasia and elsewhere, as reflected in Syria, or crucially in ever more energy deals. They are also helping cement the growing strategic partnership between China and Iran. The unrelenting Ministry of Truth narrative out of Washington about all these developments now carefully ignores the fact that, without Moscow, the “West” would never have sat down to discuss a final nuclear deal with Iran or gotten a chemical disarmament agreement out of Damascus.When the disputes between China and its neighbors in the South China Sea and between that country and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyou islands meet the Ukraine crisis, the inevitable conclusion will be that both Russia and China consider their borderlands and sea lanes private property and aren’t going to take challenges quietly -- be it via NATO expansion, U.S. military encirclement, or missile shields. Neither Beijing nor Moscow is bent on the usual form of imperialist expansion, despite the version of events now being fed to Western publics. Their “red lines” remain essentially defensive in nature, no matter the bluster sometimes involved in securing them.Whatever Washington may want or fear or try to prevent, the facts on the ground suggest that, in the years ahead, Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran will only grow closer, slowly but surely creating a new geopolitical axis in Eurasia. Meanwhile, a discombobulated America seems to be aiding and abetting the deconstruction of its own unipolar world order, while offering the BRICS a genuine window of opportunity to try to change the rules of the game. Russia and China in Pivot ModeIn Washington’s think-tank land, the conviction that the Obama administration should be focused on replaying the Cold War via a new version of containment policy to “limit the development of Russia as a hegemonic power” has taken hold. The recipe: weaponize the neighbors from the Baltic states to Azerbaijan to “contain” Russia. Cold War 2.0 is on because, from the point of view of Washington’s elites, the first one never really left town.Yet as much as the U.S. may fight the emergence of a multipolar, multi-powered world, economic facts on the ground regularly point to such developments. The question remains: Will the decline of the hegemon be slow and reasonably dignified, or will the whole world be dragged down with it in what has been called “the Samson option”?While we watch the spectacle unfold, with no end game in sight, keep in mind that a new force is growing in Eurasia, with the Sino-Russian strategic alliance threatening to dominate its heartland along with great stretches of its inner rim. Now, that’s a nightmare of Mackinderesque proportions from Washington’s point of view. Think, for instance, of how Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser who became a mentor on global politics to President Obama, would see it.In his 1997 book The Grand Chessboard, Brzezinski argued that “the struggle for global primacy [would] continue to be played” on the Eurasian “chessboard,” of which “Ukraine was a geopolitical pivot.” “If Moscow regains control over Ukraine,” he wrote at the time, Russia would “automatically regain the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.”That remains most of the rationale behind the American imperial containment policy -- from Russia’s European “near abroad” to the South China Sea. Still, with no endgame in sight, keep your eye on Russia pivoting to Asia, China pivoting across the world, and the BRICS hard at work trying to bring about the new Eurasian Century.Pepe Escobar is the roving correspondent for Asia Times/Hong Kong, an analyst for RT, and a TomDispatch regular.

Michael Rogers testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 11, 2014, before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing to become an admiral and director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Services/Commander, United States Cyber Command. (Lauren Victoria Burke/AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c9a63c000032000df51d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Warren StrobelWASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - As U.S. National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers seeks to repair the damage to the agency caused by leaks about its electronic spying programs, the abuses of government revealed in the wake of the Watergate scandal are very much on his mind.As a teenager growing up in Chicago in the 1970s, Rogers recalls watching news broadcasts with his family and being horrified by how the CIA, FBI and NSA had illegally spied on hundreds of thousands of Americans.""I can remember being very impassioned with my father, and telling him: 'Dad, what kind of nation would we ever want to be that would allow something like this to happen?'"" Rogers recalled.Four decades later, and six weeks into his new job as director of the NSA, the agency is facing similar accusations: that it has used its vast and intrusive surveillance powers to trample on privacy.Unlike 1975's congressional investigation into intelligence gathering by the CIA, FBI and NSA, today's allegations of rampant U.S. surveillance have unfolded on a global scale, damaging American relations from Brazil to Germany and Indonesia.While Rogers dismissed direct comparisons - noting that the NSA programs exposed by former contractor Edward Snowden last year had all been deemed lawful - he said he understood the concerns that have been raised about balancing individual privacy rights against security needs.""We have been down that road in our history, and it has not always turned out well. I have no desire to be part of that,"" Rogers, 54, told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit in Washington.Still, Rogers' declaration that he wants to continue the NSA's controversial search of phone records, known as metadata, has prompted critics to question if the new director really favors change at all.In his first interview since taking office, Rogers, a four-star Navy admiral, stressed the need for transparency and accountability. To repair the agency's ties with internet and telecom firms, as well as U.S. allies, the NSA has to shed some of its secretive culture and be more candid about what it is doing, he said.Some say Rogers' position falls short of what is needed. ""I don't think it's a public relations problem. What they have is a trust problem,"" said cryptography author Bruce Schneier, who worked with the Guardian newspaper to analyze some of Snowden's documents.Schneier said that transparency would have to be imposed from above - either by the White House or Congress - for it to be credible. A 'CRIPPY' RISESHighly thought of in Navy and intelligence circles, Rogers is a career cryptologist - a specialist in the breaking and making of codes - with little experience in the public spotlight.During the 70-minute Reuters interview, he seemed confident but guarded, speaking in sharply punctuated sentences and batting away questions about events that took place before he took over the Fort Meade, Maryland-based NSA.""I'm not focused on wasting my time on what was or has been,"" said Rogers, who is also commander of the U.S. military's Cyber Command.Arizona Republican Senator John McCain welcomed Roger's call for greater transparency and accountability, but said he remained skeptical that any administration official would be held responsible for any NSA programs that exceeded congressional authority.""I expect Admiral Rogers to be much more transparent,"" McCain told reporters on Wednesday. ""Do I believe that people will be punished? Nobody's ever been punished for the torture of prisoners by the CIA.""With short-cropped hair that as yet shows no signs of gray, Rogers can be alternately deadly serious - talking about ""mission sets"" and ""second-order effects"" - and self-deprecating.Returning two years ago to New Trier High School in Chicago's suburbs, where he graduated in 1977, Rogers told a class: ""I was terrible at math,"" according to an account in the Chicago Sun-Times.Failing to gain admission to the U.S. Naval Academy, but determined to be a Navy officer, Rogers enrolled in Auburn University and went through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps.His career was unusual in other respects. After six years as a surface warfare officer, considered the Navy's premier career path, he became a cryptologist or ""crippy."" Rogers has now risen higher in the Navy than any cryptologist before him.A former senior U.S. intelligence official who knows Rogers said talent spotters in the Navy channeled him into intelligence duties broader than cryptology.In 2007, he became intelligence chief for U.S. Pacific Command and two years later, intelligence director for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Before becoming NSA chief, he led Fleet Cyber Command, the Navy's cyber warfare and electronic spying unit.Underscoring the sensitivities surrounding the NSA post, President Barack Obama personally interviewed Rogers before nominating him for the job.Rogers sailed through his Senate confirmation hearing, although only after having to explain how hackers believed to be from Iran were able to penetrate a Navy computer network. 'A POWERFUL MESSAGE'Rogers faces big challenges. Morale among the NSA's tens of thousands of employees has taken a hit, and Rogers said many people in the agency found it both uncomfortable and perplexing to be under public scrutiny.Retired Air Force General Michael Hayden, a former director of both the NSA and CIA, said it was instructive that Obama chose Rogers, and veteran NSA civilian Richard Ledgett to be his deputy, at a time when the president was under enormous pressure to conduct a house cleaning of the agency.It was, Hayden said, a ""vote of confidence"" in the NSA and its staff, and a sign that, despite some reforms, Obama plans no sharp cutback in the agency's aggressive global surveillance.""They were the obvious choices before Snowden, and they were the choices after Snowden. This is a powerful message to send to the workforce,"" Hayden said.A second former senior U.S. intelligence official who knows Rogers predicted he would be a ""much more inclusive"" leader than his predecessor, the sometimes-combative Army General Keith Alexander, who led the agency for more than eight years.When Rogers is not wearing his NSA ""hat,"" he runs Cyber Command, a rapidly growing organization tasked with defending U.S. military computer networks, penetrating and mapping adversary networks, and conducting offensive cyber warfare.Rogers, who has been married to his wife, Dana, for 29 years and has a son in the Navy and one in college, may have days where he wishes he had neither job.In a video message to NSA employees after he took command, Rogers is said to have remarked that he had promised his wife he would be retired by now.

In every one, appropriately, there is a statement of mission and objectives, or a vision statement or both. Yet the more I observe arts organization struggling to balance art and fiscal stability, the more I realize that the most successful arts managers have two distinct but related visions for their organizations: one picture of the work of the organization -- the artistic and educational programming that addresses the mission and sets the organization apart -- and a second for the financial structure that provides the resources needed to pay for the programming.Both are critical. Without a clear picture of the art and other programs that will be mounted in the future, the organization cannot achieve its mission, cannot build an audience or donor base and, frankly, is of little value. Arts organizations, after all, exist to produce art. But without a clear financial picture of where money will come from and how it will be spent, however, the organization will never be free to make art without always feeling the crushing pressure of cash flow shortfalls. This financial vision reflects expectations for a growing or changing donor base, projections for ticket sales and the development of new strands of earned income.There are arts managers I observe who do a brilliant job of envisioning art -- of creating new projects of great merit and excitement -- without developing a comprehensive fiscal picture of the future. These managers typically start with a bang -- announcing great artistic projects and engaging the audience and the press. But, ultimately, they cannot pay for their dreams and the wonderful artistic plans cannot fully materialize.These managers also eventually run afoul of those board members who come from a corporate background and are used to fiscal regimen. They tolerate the artistic innovations until there is no money to pay for them. Then they swoop in, 'restore order,' and often destroy the soul of the institution.Other arts managers struggle to create exciting programming -- they stick with the tried and true -- but have a very clear picture of financial performance in the future. These managers often use the fiscal vision to justify being more conservative about programming.Yet with only a fiscal vision, they invariably lose their institutional families, experience reductions in earned and contributed income and, in truth, cannot effectively pursue a mission of artistic excellence. Despite the fiscal discipline they impose, these arts managers end up with organizations as sick as those without a financial plan.It is those arts managers who can effectively balance these two requirements -- who in fact recognize that the success on one side of the equation is essential for success on the other -- who are the most successful. They know that great art must come first but that a comprehensive financial vision must be developed in concert with a long-term artistic plan. They make the best art for the longest periods of time."

As firefighters brought several of the blazes under control, a man was charged on Friday with one count of arson in connection with one of the smaller fires.With cool, moist air coming in from the Pacific coast, firefighters gained the upper hand overnight against the so-called Cocos Fire, one of the region's fiercest, that threatened the suburban community of San Marcos north of San Diego.By Saturday morning, firefighters had contained 70 percent of the 2,520-acre (1020-hectare), said fire task force spokesman Tim Evans. That marked a significant improvement from Friday, when the blaze was only 10 percent contained.The Cocos Fire destroyed a dozen houses and another 25 structures at a local spiritualism center, county officials said.The conditions on Saturday were less windy than earlier in the week, when hot, dry Santa Ana winds drove the flames on their destructive path.Some residents evacuated from the San Marcos area were allowed to return home late on Friday and additional evacuation orders had been lifted by Saturday evening, San Diego county officials said.All road closures and evacuation orders are anticipated to be lifted at 6 p.m. Pacific Time on Sunday, the county said.It was not immediately clear how many residents were still unable to return home, but earlier in the week officials said 125,000 people lived in the evacuation zones for all the San Diego county wildfires combined.A charred body was found on Thursday at a homeless encampment overrun by flames in coastal Carlsbad, although officials said they had yet to confirm the exact cause of death.The Carlsbad blaze, which scorched 600 acres (243 hectares), left property losses of up to $15 million, gutted eight houses and destroyed an apartment building, officials said.Meanwhile, Alberto Serrato was charged on Friday with one count of arson in connection with a small fire this week in the coastal community of Oceanside, said a spokeswoman with the San Diego County District Attorney's office.

The disaster has provoked anger at a critical time for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as he mulls running in August's presidential election.A total of 25 people were initially detained for questioning and six were later released, Sahiner said. Prosecutors will now decide whether to charge or release the remaining 16 people in custody.Sahiner said one of those arrested was the company's operations manager. The manager is Akin Celik, though Sahiner didn't identify him by name.The charges can lead to sentences of between three and 15 years in prison, according to the Turkish penal code.Other company executives were among the detained as Turkish officials investigate the mining disaster. Sahiner said they included the mine's technical supervisor, its head of operations, it safety manager, duty managers and a high ranking company executive. The Dogan news agency reported earlier that Ramazan Dogru, general manager of the mine owned by Soma Holding was detained.Government and company officials have insisted that the mine was inspected regularly and negligence wasn't a factor in the explosion and fire at the mine. But reacting to anger and sympathy for the miners, government officials promised to investigate and pledged that any mine officials found to be negligent would be punished.But anger has been mounting in Turkey, leading to protests and clashes in several cities.About 2,000 people, who were angry at perceived insensitivity on how the disaster and its aftermath were handled by Erdogan and his government, marched in Istanbul chanting ""Damn AKP's dictatorship!"" referring to the ruling Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials AKP.Previous protests in Soma and other cities have turned violent as police have used tear gas and water cannons to disperse rock-throwing protesters urging Erdogan's government to resign.The Milliyet newspaper said Saturday that a preliminary report by a mine safety expert who inspected the Soma mine suggested that smoldering coal caused the mine's roof to collapse. The report said the tunnel's support beams were made of wood, not metal, and the mine had too few carbon monoxide sensors. Sahiner said that the authors are continuing their investigation and preparing a final report.Company officials have described safety standards as high, noting that the mine contained 50 gas sensors and employees were provided with gas masks.On Saturday, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said rescue workers retrieved the bodies of the last two miners missing in the disaster, putting the death toll at 301. Authorities then sealed the mine entrance with bricks.___Follow Desmond Butler at http://twitter.com/desmondbutler"

The dominant influences on education today have not helped -- the focus on ""test-and-punish""; starving schools of resources, then labeling them ""failing"" so they can be turned over to private managers; and school closures and spending inequities that have destabilized neighborhoods and disproportionately harmed minority children.Today, the fight to reclaim the promise of public education is being led by communities. A growing movement of parents; students; and business, civic and faith leaders and members -- along with educators and their unions -- is not simply calling out what's wrong, but bringing forth solutions that promote excellence and equity: early childhood education, wraparound services, high standards with real support, curbing standardized testing, and strengthening, not closing or privatizing, neighborhood schools.AFT members, alongside our community partners, are engaged in ""Mobilization May"" events throughout the month, promoting real reform -- evidence-based strategies that help all children secure the high-quality public education they need and deserve.Yesterday in Topeka, Kansas, I joined in commemorations of the landmark Supreme Court decision that originated when 8-year-old Linda Brown sought to attend her all-white neighborhood elementary school. Sixty years later, Kansas still has separate school systems, disparities that have only grown as state aid to school districts has shrunk by $263 million since 2008 to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.Likewise, in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, hundreds of AFT members and community partners held rallies, then fanned out across neighborhoods, talking to residents about the need for full funding to support neighborhood public schools and asking them to take action in support of educational justice.The fight for all children to have access to an excellent education is the Brown decision's legacy. It requires a focus on equitable access and resources, evidence of effectiveness, and scaling and sustaining successful practices. Two districts doing that are St. Louis (Mo.) Public Schools, with its emphasis on high-quality early childhood education, and Cincinnati Public Schools, where every public school is a community learning center offering supports ranging from healthcare, to legal and housing assistance, to mentoring.St. Louis recently greatly expanded its early childhood programs, which decades of research show can produce significant educational and economic benefits. Such programs help level the playing field for disadvantaged children, a particular concern in this district where 82 percent of students are African-American and 88 percent live in poverty. The AFT Innovation Fund has awarded AFT St. Louis and the school district a three-year, $450,000 grant to provide training in best practices in early education for teachers and paraprofessionals.Cincinnati's successful community schools approach demonstrates that while poverty matters in education, its effects can be mitigated. Ten years ago, one of every two students in this high-poverty district did not complete high school. Today, the graduation rate has surged to 80 percent. Achievement gaps between African-American and white students are narrowing. Student mobility, which can be so disruptive to a child's education, is down. And discipline referrals have dropped sharply -- keeping students in school, keeping them learning.I am proud that my hometown local, the United Federation of Teachers in New York City, is working with Mayor Bill de Blasio to enact universal prekindergarten, significantly expand the number of community schools, and reach a tentative contract that enables neighborhood public schools to collaborate and innovate once again.Sixty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that states must end school segregation with ""all deliberate speed."" It's painfully clear how inadequate and overdue action has been. While Congress is polarized and many pundits simply take potshots, educators, parents, unions and concerned citizens are working to create opportunities so that all kids, of all races and income levels, can succeed."

Miami Marlins phenom Jose Fernandez joined the list of pitchers to go down during the ""Year of Tommy John Surgery"" and successfully underwent the procedure on his ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow on Friday. His 2014 season is over, but that doesn't mean he won't be back and better than ever, eventually. While Marlins and baseball fans will be deprived of watching one of the best and most entertaining pitchers in the league for 12 to 18 months, the surgery pioneered by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 and famously performed on longtime New York Yankees pitcher Tommy John has a long history of success.
