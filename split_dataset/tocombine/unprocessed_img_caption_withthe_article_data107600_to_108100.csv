After going nearly 30 years without a playoff appearance, the Royals are making up for lost time, excelling in all phases of the game en route to the World Series. The unheralded squad overcame three deficits to outlast the Oakland Athletics in extra innings during a thrilling win-or-go-home American League Wild Card Game and then swept aside the powerhouse Los Angeles Angels in their American League Division Series matchup. The Royals kept the brooms out to dispatch the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series.With a combination of breathtaking speed, timely hitting, jaw-dropping defense and questionable managerial moves, the Royals have become the talk of Major League Baseball's 2014 postseason.

Another radio demagogue, Michael Savage, said Obama ""wants to infect the nation with Ebola"" as part of a war on white people. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said that the American troops being sent to West Africa to help fight the Ebola outbreak are really being sent ""to go catch Ebola and die."" Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX) managed to connect the Dallas Ebola case with ISIS, the IRS, and Benghazi. Fox News host Steve Doocy asked Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Tim Frieden, ""Why should we believe you when you're telling us this stuff?"" since Frieden works for Obama.It is difficult enough to confront resurgent diseases without an explosion of unhinged conspiracy mongering. We are not just facing Ebola. Health officials are trying to determine whether a few dozen polio-like paralysis cases in California and Colorado are associated with the reappearance of the enterovirus D68. There is a revival of measles, mumps, whooping cough and chicken pox thanks to people refusing to be vaccinated.Instead of attacking President Obama, whom conservatives have reviled for the socialist depravity of passing health care reform devised by the Heritage Foundation, perhaps they should rebuke the ignoramuses in their own base for their anti-vaccine paranoia.Turning from fools to hypocrites: Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who has been harshly critical of Obama on Ebola, proposed a 2012 budget that would have ended all U.S. foreign aid. This would have closed the U.S. Agency for International Development, which gave $95.3 million to fight Ebola in the fiscal year just ended. Paul's budget proposal would also have cut CDC funding by 20 percent from 2008 levels. An anti-government ideologue hardly has any business demanding more from agencies he would have shrunk or eliminated. Then there is Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who talks of seceding from the Union yet relies on federal health authorities in his state's first Ebola case.Some fault federal officials for urging calm, as if that in itself is a cover up. Excuse me, but just by saying ""Ebola"" Obama is already ahead of President Reagan, who refused for years even to say the word ""AIDS."" The right simply cannot give Obama credit for anything ever. Back to reality: just as the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire taught us something about workplace safety, any disease outbreak can expose weak spots in our public response. We need not become a nation of Chicken Littles on that account.There are legitimate issues surrounding the Dallas hospital's handling of the Ebola case. But we should not look for enlightenment to Laura Ingraham, Michael Savage, Republican congressmen from Texas, or the smug nitwits on ""Fox & Friends.""Are you concerned about deadly threats? In 2011 there were 11,068 firearm deaths and 32,479 motor vehicle deaths. There were an estimated 12,000 deaths from the 2009 flu pandemic. Influenza is much more easily transmitted than Ebola. What do you suppose is different in this case? Can you say Africa? A few months ago the same unscrupulous pols and pundits were telling dire tales of diseased hordes of brown children at our southern border.How can we tout our national greatness while being driven by fear? We cannot wall ourselves off from every danger. A great nation confronts global challenges and shares its expertise, as America is doing in West Africa (though for thousands it is too late). But why try to help, some on the right appear to be asking, when there is a political opening to be exploited?The arc of the moral universe does not bend toward justice by itself. It is up to us to defend our country and its values against the armies of ignorance and contempt. If decent and thoughtful citizens hesitate, or withdraw from the public square in disgust, we can be assured that the know-nothings and bigots will fill the gap.This piece originally appeared in Washington Blade and Bay Windows."
2,POLITICS,Why South Dakota's Senate Race is Not Like Kansas,"Ryan Casey, ContributorJ.D. candidate, University of Washington School of Law; Comman...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-south-dakotas-senate-_b_5975256.html,Dramatic developments last week in the South Dakota Senate race have left national political observers scrambling to make sense of it.,2014-10-13,"U.S. Senate candidate Rick Weiland speaks at the Democratic Convention Friday evening, June 27, 2014 in Yankton, SD. (AP Photo/Dave Eggen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6916a2230000be15de09ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dramatic developments last week in the South Dakota Senate race have left national political observers scrambling to make sense of it. The temptation is to parallel the SD race with the one in Kansas, where a Republican favorite is suddenly vulnerable, and the Democrat has dropped out of the race to the benefit of Independent Greg Orman. But it is a mistake to equate Kansas with South Dakota, where Democrat Rick Weiland is running an inspiring, populist campaign, crisscrossing the state and holding spirited rallies. With just over three weeks until Election Day, this 4-way race is wide open.The South Dakota contest burst onto the national radar on October 8, when news of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's commitment to spend $1 million in the state followed closely on the heels of Mayday PAC's $1 million pledge on behalf of Weiland and his anti-Big Money crusade. In choosing to invest in the SD race, both groups cited internal polling showing the race is winnable.In Kansas, incumbent Republican Pat Roberts barely escaped a primary defeat against a hapless, Tea Party novice. He faces growing criticism since he no longer even possesses a home in Kansas, and has consistently polled below 40%.But in the month following the August primary, Orman, a millionaire who can help finance his own campaign, has proven to be a much stronger candidate than was Democratic nominee Chad Taylor. As a former Democrat, Orman's center-left positions make him highly appealing to Kansas Democrats and other anti-Roberts voters. Taylor, meanwhile, won his primary by default, but baggage stemming from policy controversies and gender and race discrimination suits from his tenure as a district attorney left him unpopular with key Democratic constituencies. A progressive women's group endorsed Orman, and pressure for Taylor to exit the race mounted quickly within the Kansas Democratic Party establishment. Taylor withdrew in September, and under Kansas law, his name will not be on the ballot, leaving a 2-way race between Roberts and Orman.In South Dakota, by contrast, Democrat Rick Weiland enjoys the energy and enthusiasm of progressive activists across the state. Having styled his campaign from day one as a populist movement to rid politics from the toxic effects of Big Money, Weiland takes a page out of the grassroots playbook of heartland underdogs like George McGovern and Paul Wellstone. In fact, in April Weiland made history as the first candidate ever to visit all 311 towns in South Dakota. The next day, he started over visiting them all again.Traveling on a shoestring budget, Weiland chronicled the campaign narrative by rewriting words to such songs as Johnny Cash's ""I've Been Everywhere"" and Old Crow Medicine Show's ""Wagon Wheel."" As of this posting, the video had nearly 30,000 views on YouTube.À la Wellstone, Weiland has stretched his campaign dollars, eschewing 30-sec TV spots for 15-sec ones instead, just talking incredibly fast, like this one, this one and this one.The true wild card in this race is the Independent, Larry Pressler. A recent SurveyUSA poll shows a statistical 3-way tie, with former two-term governor Mike Rounds at 35%, Pressler at 32%, Weiland at 28% and Tea Partier Gordon Howie at 3%, with 2% undecided and a margin of error of +/- 4%.Unlike in Kansas, in which the Independent is a former Democrat, Pressler was a three-term Republican senator with a conservative voting record. In fact, Pressler only left the Republican Party last year, though he endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, hoping for a presidential appointment. Even now, Pressler won't say whether he'd caucus with the Republicans or the Democrats.Pressler supports overturning Roe v. Wade. He bizarrely claims he marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., though in 1983 he was one of just 22 U.S. Senators to vote against the creation of the MLK holiday. Pressler does not possess a home in South Dakota; his principal residence is Washington, DC, which allows him to save up to $70,000 a year in property taxes. But that could explain why he once considered a run for DC Mayor.In the Senate, Pressler held the dubious honor of having taken more PAC money than anyone in Congress, spending much of it on himself. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader pointed out in 1994: ""The [finance] reports dating to 1991 offer few clues to explain how or why Pressler and his wife incurred so many expenses that required reimbursement, or how any of the $500,000 spent related to campaign activities."" Along with the gaudy campaign expense tabs for things like luxury hotels, maid services and the opera, Pressler drew a salary of more than $125,000 from his campaign for reelection, in addition to his Senate salary and generous benefit package.Republican Mike Rounds, meanwhile, has employed a strategy of skipping debates, hiding from voters, accepting big checks from corporate donors, and generally counting on Republican inertia to drag him into the U.S. Senate. A backbencher by nature, Rounds was an accidental governor who slipped in through the back door in 2002 when two Republican heavyweights clobbered each other in a 3-way primary.Despite two terms as governor in a Republican state, however, Rounds has languished in the mid-30s in polls. He is dogged by a scandal involving EB-5, a federal program run by each state which allows wealthy foreigners to invest in purported job creation programs in exchange for green cards. As governor, Rounds administered the program with virtually no oversight, allowing his economic development secretary, Richard Benda, to privatize the program into a for-profit corporation. The investment money was effectively siphoned into a political slush fund.The highest-profile EB-5 project in South Dakota was the Northern Beef Packers plant, which received nearly $100 million from EB-5 investments. It went bankrupt in 2013, just nine months after it opened. In October last year, Benda was found dead in a farm field while under investigation by Attorney General Marty Jackley, though he was never charged. Benda's death, caused by a shotgun wound to his abdomen, was eventually ruled a suicide.Rounds and the other officials involved refuse to testify under oath, though Rounds did provide written testimony to state lawmakers in September that he was not aware of litigation involving EB-5 and a California firm. News reports surfaced recently revealing that the governor's office was officially served with court papers in 2009, and that the governor's own brother, Dennis Rounds, was overseeing all state litigation for the governor. Rounds subsequently amended his testimony.Attorney General Jackley's investigation, meanwhile, amounts to the proverbial fox guarding the henhouse. A highly ambitious politician in his own right, Jackley is fully entrenched within the South Dakota Republican political establishment. He has resisted calls from Democratic lawmakers and other critics to appoint an independent prosecutor.As an Independent candidate, Pressler lacks the institutional and organizational support of a political party, and has only raised about $100,000 in the entire campaign. It is difficult to imagine him competing with Weiland and Rounds in the homestretch ad blitz, especially as he takes incoming fire from the left and the right. As his support wanes, the key question is which of the two major-party candidates will be the bigger beneficiary. But one thing is for certain--this isn't Kansas. Rick Weiland is bringing it, and he's playing for keeps."
3,BUSINESS,Do Minimum Wage Increases Benefit the Middle Class?,"Timothy J. Barnett, ContributorProfessor of Political Science at Jacksonville State University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/do-minimum-wage-increases_b_5970266.html,This is not to argue against minimum wage increases as much as to argue that this remedy must not be substituted for reforms at deeper levels.,2014-10-13,"Demonstrators rally for better wages outside a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago, Thursday, Dec. 5, 2013. Demonstrations planned in 100 cities are part of push by labor unions, worker advocacy groups and Democrats to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25. (AP Photo/Paul Beaty)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb314872400003100973f22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seattle is among a modest but growing number of major U.S. cities committed to raising its minimum wage well above national and state standards. If its planned trajectory holds, Seattle will boast a $15 minimum wage in 2018. Observers are wondering what happens if Seattle's initiative goes viral in U.S. metropolitan areas? Will minimum wage increases implemented in leading urban areas benefit the American middle-class as well as the working class?According to Nick Hanauer, plutocrat-patrician extraordinaire, corporate management tends to believe that wage increases for workers are detrimental to company profits. As businesses with unionized workers have learned, it can be difficult in an age of global trade to raise prices as an offset to wage increases, especially with bounded consumer spending capacity and the availability of lower quality but useable substitutionary items. Consequently, management often pushes back against calls for wage increases.Do many corporate executives mistakenly assume that profits can advance endlessly while consumers' financial condition stagnates? Does the executive mindset suggest an evolving ""tragedy of the commons,"" with middle and working classes serving as an ""over-grazed pasture,"" as in an exploited commons? If so, might minimum wage increases be useful if implemented carefully as part of a larger, balanced plan for mitigating excess economic inequality?The Great Society and the Minimum WageThere is no simple way to anticipate the various impacts of worker wage increases in a globally complex interdependent economy. Probable effects are variable across industries, business models, competitive environments, disparate national circumstances, and sunk cost contexts -- a point that government analyses often overlook. What we do know is that a local minimum wage increase is a different animal than a national increase.Parts of the country with metropolitan areas that currently employ many workers at wages near the allowable minimum will likely find the competitiveness of their businesses diminished relative to higher wage portions of the country once the lower wage areas raise their minimum wage. Areas of geographic economic weakness in the U.S. might become weaker still relative to more prosperous parts of the country, thus undercutting LBJ's vision of a ""Great Society"" with semi-homogenous prosperity. This important observation is often overlooked, with more attention given to the impact of minimum wage increases on the global competitiveness of U.S. businesses. There are countless ways to calculate (or spin) the probable benefits and costs of raising the national minimum wage by a substantial amount. Those who have studied the debate (including economists, social scientists and entrepreneurs) realize that potential unanticipated consequences are numerous. Careful reflection suggests the need for balanced remedies, where minimum wage increases are packaged with other economic reforms and structural realignments. This is not to argue against minimum wage increases as much as to argue that this remedy must not be substituted for reforms at deeper levels.Middle Tier Productivity IncentivesWhat happens when the minimum wage closes in on the median or average wage in a given business sector? This is an important question. During the last several years American businesses have hired hundreds of thousands of workers who would not be employed were it not for the macro-economic effects of the Fed's easy money policies. In many low-end retail establishments one sees checkout clerks, shelf stockers and other personnel working at about half the pace and productivity of their nearby peers. Some of these low productivity workers keep their jobs only because a modest minimum wage allows employers to ramp up productivity or service capacity in defense of market share. If a minimum wage increases causes the wage gap between efficient workers and lackluster workers to collapse, a personnel crisis can result. The crisis may reflect a tearing of the fabric of sensed remuneration justice within the organization, or it may serve to undermine the tractability, enthusiasm and productivity of better workers. In the long-run, a company may have little choice but to provide across-the-board wage increases to maintain wage differentials between bottom productivity tiers and more efficient groups above.While the impact of such increases will vary across sectors, regions and competitive situations, the likely aggregate effect is wage-push inflation, unless a good portion of historically high corporate profitability is used to pay for the worker wage increases (thus holding steady the prices of goods and services rather than raising them to offset wage increases). Granted, the corporate hierarchy will not compromise its compensation differential except by the force of law, tax policy mandates, loss of profitability or the reformation of asset market operations.Theoretically, a wealth transfer from elites to workers cools off the stock market. A cooler stock market diminishes asset-appreciation spillover into the general economy, thus buffering whatever inflationary pressures are generated by the increased consumer spending that higher wages bring. The economically attractive part of this type of wealth transfer is that increased consumer spending shores up corporate revenues, thus supporting corporate profits by means of improved sales volume. This virtuous cycle cannot be attained without regulatory guidance to corporations concerning the proper utilization of high profits on behalf of the sustainable public interest.  In short, corporate boards need guidance and guardrails that limits their ability to use profits for stock buybacks that disproportionately benefit the executive suite and mega-shareholders. As of late, corporations have justified buybacks by claiming investors' funds will go elsewhere if a given corporation does not rise to the challenge of buying back stock as aggressively as other corporations in the sector. ""You're got to keep dancing,"" is the refrain. A similarly contrived excuse is used for jacking up the compensation of corporate executives. This type of injustice will not be contained until ethical boundaries (with regulatory teeth) are applied to corporate compensation behaviors.Why the Middle Class Takes the Hit As it regards the consequences of wage-push inflation, a major problem for the American middle class is that they consume a disproportionate amount of whatever modestly priced goods and services exist in the nation. Households in the top 5 percent of the income distribution spectrum (i.e., above $186,000 in 2011 and around $200,000 now), often purchase goods and services from companies able to pay superior wages. Meanwhile, households in the bottom 40% of income distribution (with merely 11.6% of the nation's spending power), have but a relatively light impact on the total consumption picture. Consequently, when minimum wage increases generate wage-push inflation in the category of relatively cheap consumer goods and services, it is the middle-class that finds their purchasing power and lifestyle prospects eroded most significantly. Working class people who receive substantial minimum wage increases obtain a buffer against the higher prices. Likewise, high income earners are not much impacted by higher prices and are buying goods and services not provided by minimum wage workers. It is the middle class that remains vulnerable. If middle class incomes are raised to offset this vulnerability, the cost of living goes up for everyone, assuming no large productivity or business efficiency gains as an offset. Consequently, the best solution is to redesign the way asset markets distribute capital so that the middle class picks up the increased wealth that the top 3 percent have increasingly harvested. Instead of raising middle class wages, increase the middle class's ownership share of the national capital stock, something that some thoughtful observers call ""capital homesteading.""Admittedly, abysmally low worker-wages in countries like Mexico have greatly limited the prospect of wage push CPI inflation in the United States, giving the Federal Reserve cover to service Wall Street's easy money demands. Nonetheless, if one is concerned about excessive income inequality and basic human dignity, it seems less than honorable to accept inhumanly low wages in an adjacent country as the brake on wage inflation in one's own country. This is why global standards on behalf of human dignity are necessary, including powerful incentives for all countries to contain their population growth by rewarding prudent family planning. ConclusionIn sum, the enhancement of minimum wage protections is one important spoke in the wheel of economic justice. But one-spoked wheels don't roll very far. Thoughtful plans for combating income and wealth inequality gaps must incorporate many reforms. Additional 'spokes' in a new wheel of economic wisdom include improvements in the fitness of educational endeavors, entertainment products that educate while they humor, better avoidance of wasteful enterprise (including low-gain healthcare), and far-seeing refinements to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Other needed reforms include an improved vision for the constructive deployment of capital, incentives for prudent business efficiencies, and policies that reward businesses for distributing profits with a less elitist view of deservedness and merit. Each of these reform agendas needs thoughtful inclusion in the national policy conversation."
4,ARTS,The Influence of William Bailey,"Marc Trujillo, ContributorTRUJILLOMARCART on Instagram",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-influence-of-william-_b_5970074.html,William Bailey had a long and influential career as a teacher at Yale and continues to have a long and influential career as a painter.

I always wanted to see a show of painters he influenced, and since that's not in my power, I asked some painters and compiled their responses and some of their work to put this together as a substitute and a way of giving thanks.  Hilary Harkness Blue Nude With BlondeHilary Harkness They say good things come in threes. I'm not one who puts much stock in sayings, but when thinking about William Bailey's excellence as a teacher, I am a believer.One: His logical, rigorous and methodical approach to painting. He took the time to clearly convey the basics.Two: His humanity. When we had breakthroughs, he shared our joy. When we were sick, he sent get-well notes. When we were idiots, he suffered no fools.Three: His ability to talk about art. When he spoke about his own art he was modest and self-revealing. When he spoke about the art of the masters, he put us in touch with the mystery of painting.All three of these aspects of him as a teacher stick with me alongside a memory of an otherwise ordinary day that upon reflection reveals one of those moments where who your teacher is can impact your view of the world, even years later.On that day, he took us to the Yale Art Gallery. He walked with us patiently from painting to painting, asking us to discuss what we saw. His own comments and insights were fascinating, and nothing like what I had heard in my art history classes. When he eventually called on me to discuss a Hopper painting, I just stood there sweating. He didn't mop my brow or help me fill in the blanks. He just stood back and let me grapple with the mystery of the painting. In this way, he fostered a curiosity that keeps me inspired as an artist to this day. I'm still absorbing his teaching, and would welcome a chance to spend another otherwise ordinary day grappling with a painting in his presence. Jenny Dubnau Self Portrait Shrugging oil on canvas 42 x 36 inches 2014Jenny Dubnau William Bailey really taught me how to paint, or, should I say, gave me the tools to teach myself how to paint. Style was never a particular preoccupation for Bailey: he taught formal issues in a spare, open and almost philosophical way. Form transmuted into meaning almost seamlessly. How you make space in your painting, how you use color to create space, was, for Bailey, the deepest incarnation of metaphor, and style flowed from that: he'd always talk about the ""world"" that your painting conjured, and that world was the metaphorical structure around which your meaning circulated. I also recall with fondness some of his quintessential questions: ""Can I 'peel' this piece of paint 'off' the painting's surface? Can I 'press' into the surface of the painting?"" In other words, how effectively are you building your space? Jordan Wolfson Interior with Three Chairs II oil on linen 48 x 42 inches 2014Jordan Wolfson Bailey was an influence and important teacher for me. He was the first teacher to give me a clear, basic understanding of how to set up large tonal relationships in order to create believable space and light and form. I couldn't believe it wasn't until grad school that I got that explanation! I still feel the shock even today, over twenty years later. He and I got along fairly well and still today are in touch every once in awhile. One story comes to mind - I think I was in my second year, and doing a little series of kind of expressionistic self-portraits, you know - grad school experimentation. So, Bailey comes in, and takes a slow look, the way he did, and after a good long pause he said in his measured tone, ""Well, sometimes we just need to get these things out of our system."" What a line! Susan Clark Screwdriver 45 x 66 inchesSusan Clark I think that the most important things I got from him is the building a work of art from the whole rather than the parts. I remember in figure class Bailey asking me what I wanted to say about the figure I was working on. He pointed out that the figure lying on her side and the objects around her were creating a kind of waterfall flow across my canvass. I learned to look for that ""poetic moment"" first, then everything gets blocked in during the first 15 minutes. How much you push it from there is a choice. Susana JacobsonSusana Jacobson Bill's paintings lock the logic of painting to the irrational mysteries of the space inside them. That became a fascination for me, though I would not say my work ever took this on the way his does. He uses it to illumine while I use it for trickery. Denis Farrell From Poems to My Father 2013Denis Farrell- I said something about expression once to him, self expression, to which he replied, ""No"".....I guess he meant that, it's the PAINTING that counts, and so it is. Other than that, I think he grew frustrated with too much talk and probably couldn't wait to get back to the studio like all good painters. Dik F. Liu 12 x 12 inches oil on panel 2014 Dik F. Liu Bailey was among the most influential professors in my education. He was always poised and wise, and was a sensible voice that deeply affected my artistic outlook.Once during a studio visit, he pointed out to me that with each painting decision a painter made, he must then decides to either accept or reject that decision, and that's ""where the individual expression steps in"". Marc Trujillo 16500 Sherman Way oil on polyester over aluminum 28 x 41 inches 2014Marc Trujillo I'm grateful to have had William Bailey as a teacher. When he spoke, you quickly got the sense that even the small statements were part of a larger organic whole, his painting and guidance either stemmed from the same guiding philosophy, or maybe better to say that his teaching and his philosophy both stemmed from his painting. His teaching was geared towards helping me understand painting in its own terms, he would call my attention to a particular area of a painting that broke the threshold of a unified coherence and looked 'collaged in', the remedy was usually a small shift in value or color. Bailey would also call my attention to the 'music' of the way I was putting my choices together. He was conveying a philosophy about what painting means in and of itself via specific concrete examples. He once called me out for using the words 'things represented' because, he said 'it's always a painting'. That tending to the whole painting as painting and its philosophical implications has continued to be of primary importance to me, constituting a sort of 'true north' in times of doubt. In his paintings a large part of his achievement is reconciling high modernist painting and representational painting, for example, no highlights to make the painting servile to representation. If realism and the needs of the painting have a place where it must be one or the other, then realism gives way. In a William Bailey painting, the surface of objects may imitate the qualities of paint, but not the other way around, always painting about painting on the occasion of a particular instance.    WilliamBailey Soldier 40 x 48 inches oil on canvas 2011One of the subtleties in his work which has been influential for me is his sophisticated conflation of space. In his still life paintings, for example, there's a presumption of closeness to the objects on a table, the size and scale make them seem just out of reaching distance, but on closer inspection, the perspective of the ellipses tell you that you're much further from what you're looking at. This 'push back' in the drawing simultaneously conveys distance and makes the paintings a more plausible part of the space the viewer occupies, which is what I like about it as well, it's the opposite of the sort of fisheye perspective that can remind you that what you're looking at is a 'picture of something'."

Graphic Courtesy of John Pepion and Winona LaDukeI learned this lesson while delivering hay.A group of exhausted but determined Native riders and their horses were camped at a remote farm near Pine River, Minnesota late this summer. The ""Love Water, Not Oil"" tour, sponsored by Honor the Earth to draw attention to the routing of the proposed Enbridge Sandpiper Pipeline, was nearing the end of a two hundred mile ride through the lake country heartland. Winona LaDuke called and asked if I could find ten bales of hay to make certain their horses had enough forage in case pastureland was unavailable on the last leg of the ride. Thomas Pope and his wife, Freya Manfred, happened to be visiting me when I got the call, and both were eager to join me on the hay delivery errand. Tom is a screenwriter of significant accomplishment, and Freya is an award winning beloved poet and memoirist who happens to be the daughter of Frederick Manfred. Manfred has been compared to Louis L'Amour. His storytelling focuses on the American Midwest and the western prairies. The borderlands of Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota and Nebraska became his fictional ""Siouxland.""This is Anishinaabe country. This is the land inhabited by the characters in LaDuke's epic book, Last Standing Woman, that most of you have probably never heard of. Go out and find a copy. It will change your life and your point of view. Art was destined to meet reality as our pickup loaded with hay lumbered down the back roads of Minnesota to LaDuke's encampment.In the Anishinaabe universe there are eight layers of the world--the world in which we live, and those above and below. Most of us live in the world we can see. What we do, however, may intersect with those other worlds.The quote is from LaDuke.As a journalist, I am trained to view the world with a dispassionate eye. I fear that the discipline involved offers nothing more than what one sees with eyes clouded by cataracts. That is the world I see. The spiritual depth perception is often missing.The screenwriter and the poet live in worlds that intersect with the universe LaDuke writes about. There are other worlds. There are other ways of looking at things. There are worlds above and worlds below, and the ""Love Water, Not Oil"" effort lived and breathed in those worlds. I am not sure I communicated that while writing about the pipeline this summer. My writing did not intersect properly with the rich, multi-layered universe of the First Nation indigenous peoples.As Tom, Freya and I drove into the camp with nourishment for the horses, we each had a point of view that, when combined, offered spiritual depth.The journalist in me saw the difficulty of the journey faced by horses and riders. It is not easy to ride two hundred miles and camp with your horses in unfamiliar terrain. I saw tents, and corrals. I smelled breakfast being cooked over open fires and fretted about where to put the hay. I wondered how in the world, my worried world, that the riders were accomplishing this dangerous journey.Tom, the screenwriter, immediately spoke about the romance of the scene. He saw hardy native riders, tents that could have been tipis, and smoke that bathed the encampment in the mist of fascination. Freya, the poet, spoke to me about the beauty, determination and strength of the people. Each of us had a unique point of view. Each was valid and complete in its own way, but it was not until I read LaDuke's writing in a three part series running in Indian Country Today, that I understood how we desperately need Indian writers to have a voice in media. Whether it is online or mainstream print media, the Native Voice is lacking in access to the white world. I wanted to write a story about strength and resilience. I wanted to write a story about the singers, the horse people, and the earth lodge builders of the Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara peoples, the squash and corn, the heartland of agricultural wealth in the Northern Plains. That's the story I have been wanting to write. But that story is next. The story today is about folly, greed, confusion, unspeakable intergenerational trauma and terrifying consequences, all in a moment in time. That time is now.This is the voice of Winona LaDuke. This is her point of view, and it is one that a white writer cannot possibly hope to replicate. There are many other native writers, of course, but there is no one who has been so eloquent in telling the story of what big oil is destroying in Indian Country. It is a story of trauma and generational loss.My effort today is one of convincing the readers of this blog to read the three part series in Indian Country Today. You can access it here. After you read the series, reflect on its unique point of view. Listen to your heart, and your heart will bring you to a universe with many layers. The story needs more than telling. The story needs listening."
6,RELIGION,Beyond Borders: An Unexpected Trip to Mexico With a Dying Man,"Rev.

I thought I would spend most of today completing multiple unfinished writing projects that I have long neglected.

I thought I would spend most of today completing multiple unfinished writing projects that I have long neglected. Things changed when I met Ramon. Carrollton, Texas is not the type of place one would expect miracles to happen. When I pulled up to the apartment complex two days ago, I had no idea what I was getting into. I only had vague knowledge that a young man was dying of bone cancer inside and needed help. Upon seeing Ramon, I knew the situation was dire. Ramon's father seemed to be giving all the help that he could conjure up. The remainder of Ramon's family was back in Guadalajara. Then came the request...""Can you help us get him back to Mexico?""  Through much conversation and consultation, persons from the Cathedral of Hope United Church of Christ, our Spanish-speaking congregation and Hope for Peace and Justice worked together to devise a plan to get Ramon home. I was overwhelmed and heartbroken by the whole situation. Truthfully, I was afraid and ready to get out of the apartment. When a traveling companion fell through for Ramon, one of my colleagues looked up and declared, ""Can anyone travel with him?"" Though words came out of my mouth, I know that I didn't speak them. It was as if I was listening to someone else. ""I will go!"" I heard. When I realized that it was my mouth the words came out of, I knew the Spirit had spoken. In the countenance of the universe, I realized a miraculous human union beyond the power of death and across boundaries of language and nationality was taking place.  For the last few days, I have grown angry thinking about the factors that complicate Ramon's situation. Though he has spent ten years working hard and paying taxes in this country, he does not have the proper papers to be documented. Without papers, Ramon has had an incredibly difficult time securing healthcare that could save his life. Due to his Mexican nationality, many in our country have treated him as something other than human. Ramon has relied on the charity of strangers to get through this difficult hour. Some have been charitable and some have not. From his nationality to his access to money, Ramon has lived his life on the other side of a boundary from most of us. Though he was here with us, we were not with him. We forgot that we belong to each other. We forgot that Ramon is in us and we are in Ramon. Today, I am experiencing human connection with Ramon in all fullness.  The cries of pain and sorrow that filled the air as Ramon's dad kissed his son for the last time at the airport shook my bones. In the deep love that I saw exchanged, I saw how much God loves us. I prayed for the day when death will be no more. When Ramon kissed his dad goodbye for the last time in this life, I knew that I was witnessing something eternal. Passing through security, Ramon was unable to lift his legs. I picked up each leg and helped him stand. I realized in this moment that Ramon was teaching me how to lift my legs and stand. Getting on the flight, I lifted Ramon out of his wheelchair and placed him into another wheelchair. In this moment of my frustration that he even had to switch chairs, Ramon taught me to be flexible. While I administered morphine to Ramon, I realized that he was medicating me with his presence. Throughout his groans and struggles of pain, I too groaned and struggled with the pain of knowing that a 28-year-old man was dying in front of me. What type of God would allow such a thing? When Ramon crossed himself and kissed his rosary, I embraced his faith as my faith. Throughout our deeply spiritual journey, I realize again and again that the images of God we all carry connected Ramon and I. In my moments of doubt and anger, I realized that God was with us because Ramon was with us.  Upon arrival to Guadalajara, we walked tall together. Together, we made it. There was a woman who walked up to Ramon and said she saw him on television. After giving him some money, she asked that Ramon interceded to the Virgin of Guadalupe on her behalf. From my vantage point there was no need for intercession, the heavenly saint was being made reality right before our eyes. When Ramon encountered his brothers and friends, I struggled to maintain my composure. In the midst of a monumental sadness at an approaching death, the joy that flowed out transcended death. Though Ramon's trip had just ended, I knew it had only just begun.   Though I have only known him for three days and will probably never speak to him again, Ramon will remain with me for eternity. I don't speak such a thing to be dramatic. I speak it because it is true. Love is eternal. Though we couldn't easily speak to each other, Ramon and I shared love in our brief moments of union. In allowing borders to subside and love to come in, we quickly realized that we belong to each other. In the midst of such numerous borders to human flourishing, I pray that the world will realize the same.  Amen."
7,HEALTHY LIVING,How Sleep Affects Morality,"Christopher M. Barnes, ContributorAssociate Professor of Management, Foster School of Business, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sleep-moral-awareness_b_5908130.html,"If we want people to make carefully-considered moral choices, and if we want them to spot unethical behavior in others, then sleep needs to be a priority.",2014-10-12,2014-10-10-sleepandmoralawarenessGoogletrendschart.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-10-sleepandmoralawarenessGoogletrendschart-thumb.jpg,"Most people think they are ethical. But ethical transgressions happen frequently. Researchers ask the question of why this occurs and pursue scientific inquiries designed to provide answers. One line of inquiry focuses on moral awareness. My colleague Scott Reynolds, a prolific ethics researcher here at the University of Washington, defines moral awareness as a person's determination that a situation contains moral content and legitimately can be considered from a moral point of view. Research indicates that without moral awareness, people are unlikely to effectively engage in moral judgment or accurately judge the morality of others. In other words, without awareness that there is a moral component to a given decision or action, people will proceed without engaging in a thorough and purposeful decision process about that morality. And without moral awareness, people will not recognize unethical behaviors engaged by other people as unethical.Recent research indicates that moral awareness is dynamic over time, such that the same individual can be high in moral awareness at one point in time and low at another point in time. Part of this is based on how much energy and self-control the individual has at a given moment. My colleagues (Brian Gunia, assistant professor of management at Johns Hopkins University, and David Wagner, assistant professor of management at the University of Oregon) and I built from these findings to ask the following question: Does a lack of sleep hinder moral awareness?We started from the idea that moral awareness involves directing attention to the moral components of a given decision or behavior. Specifically, in order to bring a moral issue into conscious awareness, people must go through an effortful process of directing attention to the issue. But previous research indicates that a lack of sleep makes it more difficult to direct and maintain attentional processes. Thus, we hypothesized that a lack of sleep would lead to low levels of moral awareness.To test this hypothesis, we conducted three empirical studies. First, we conducted a laboratory study in which we randomly assigned participants to a control group (mean of 6.43 hours of sleep) and a group in which participants were partially sleep deprived (mean of 4.35 hours of sleep). Then all participants read a scenario which involved an ethical violation, and were asked to complete a measure of their moral awareness (e.g., ""This situation could be described as a moral issue""). Consistent with our hypothesis, sleep deprived participants scored lower in moral awareness than the control group.We conducted a follow-up study in which we followed a different group of participants over multiple days, this time focusing on naturally occurring variance in their sleep. In this study, each person participated on 4 separate days. On each day, participants indicated how much they slept the night before, read one of 4 ethical scenarios, and then completed the same measure of moral awareness as the first study. Consistent with our hypothesis, when a given individual was low in sleep, moral awareness suffered, and when that same individual had a full night of sleep, moral awareness was high.We conducted a third study designed to capitalize on the sleep loss produced by the Spring change to daylight saving time. Previous research indicates that on the Monday immediately following the change to daylight saving time, people get around 40 minutes less sleep than they otherwise would. So we compared moral awareness on that Monday (which we call ""Sleepy Monday"") with the Mondays immediately before and after. However, in contrast to the first two studies, we used a different measure of moral awareness. Based on the idea that internet searches reflect what people are thinking about, we used Google Trends to track internet search behavior. We generated a list of words associated with morality, and then examined the frequency of searches of this list across the three Mondays of interest. We also did the same for Google's general search categories, in order to see if any changes across the Mondays were associated with changes in general search behavior rather than that specifically focused on morality. We found that there was a dip on Sleepy Monday in searches including terms from our morality list, but no such corresponding dip in the Google general search categories. This was consistent with our expectation that Sleepy Monday would be characterized by lower moral awareness (as operationalized by internet searches).Although there are limitations to each of these three studies, the consistency in the findings across the different methods should lend confidence to the idea that a lack of sleep does indeed erode moral awareness. This is important because moral awareness is a driver not only of one's own morality, but also in how people evaluate the morality of others. If we want people to make carefully considered moral choices, and if we want them to spot unethical behavior in others, then sleep needs to be a priority. Thus, a lack of sleep not only influences unethical behavior, but also in how we process information about morality as well.For more information about this research, see our forthcoming article in the Journal of Sleep Research."
