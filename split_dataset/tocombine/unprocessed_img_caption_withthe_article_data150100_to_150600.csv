But before we knew it, romance had crept in.",2013-07-04,2013-07-03-46689_10151302342645892_2064871664_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-03-46689_10151302342645892_2064871664_n.jpg,"I was on the treadmill, somewhere around mile 4, when I found out that DOMA had been repealed, and that my marriage to Mariann was now federally recognized. The gym was nearly empty, which isn't uncommon for 10 a.m., even in lower Manhattan. One lone, mustached guy who was busy on the elliptical was the only person in sight. The news came in through the tiny TV on my machine, and I yelped. I looked over at the guy, hoping to share a celebratory moment, but my glee was lost on him. Ah, never mind. Even though he didn't know it, he was sharing this moment with me anyway, this piece of history, this piece of my story.Five months ago, Mariann and I decided to go down to City Hall -- I clad in an ironic, Donna Reed-style dress, she looking festive in turquoise -- and exchange wedding vows in front of two of our favorite queer friends (one of whom wore her best hoodie and favorite Chucks for the occasion). We had intended to be somewhat tongue-in-cheek about our marriage. In the hours leading up to the ""I do,"" we kept trying the word ""wife"" on for size, and then guffawing at the absurdity of how it sounded, like we were each the other's show-and-tell item at school. But before we knew it, romance had crept in like a blinding sunbeam through the window, the kind our dog Rose finds comfort in following around the apartment. It was Feb. 1, 2013, when we tied the knot, and the temperature that day seemed to average somewhere around 20 degrees -- or at least that's how my numb knuckles and toes experienced it (cold feet?). Following our vows, our friend Sally (the one with the hoodie) treated us to decaf soy lattes at the nearby Starbucks, and we were oddly touched to recognize other City Hall newlyweds also partaking in the apparent post-nuptial Starbucks rite of passage. We proceeded to have the perfect day: buying thin gold bands from a jeweler on Canal Street (yes, after the fact); enjoying a late breakfast of congee at Buddha Bodai, our favorite Chinatown restaurant; finding cheap fruit for sale under the Manhattan Bridge; stopping in Little Italy to warm our frozen hands over even more hot drinks; and, finally, walking back to our closet-sized apartment in Soho, pulling open the couch, and settling in to watch reruns of Battlestar Gallactica while eating 3 pounds of fresh cherries. It was, unquestionably, our perfect day. Even though we had been a happy couple for six years already and hadn't expected anything particularly monumental from adding marriage to the mix, our love settled into a new compartment, one we hadn't before known we had. Much as I experienced on my wedding day, when DOMA was repealed, I became inarticulately emotional, in ways I hadn't expected. Prior to getting hitched, I had rather vocally questioned the marriage-industrial complex -- and, truthfully, I still worry about its oppressive roots. I wonder if I am an assimilationist, and I question whether or not that's a bad thing. If I'm going to be honest, I have even spent time debating whether my married straight friends feel less guilt about cashing in on their hetero privilege now that I'm married too. I struggle with whether the fact that I'm married means that I am also cashing in on some silly privilege when many LGBT people continue to be oppressed and marginalized in truly incomprehensible and dangerous ways. And I think about the way that society celebrates those who live their lives two by two, as if single lives are somehow not quite as successful, when just glimpsing around reveals plenty of small, miserable lives lived coupled, and big, vibrant ones lived alone. So is it selfish of me to look down at my simple wedding band and feel a jolt of excitement knowing that I am joined with Mariann in holy matrimony, whatever that means? With no hope of celebrating with the elliptical guy left, I ran home, quite literally, to Mariann. She was busy fixing the cabinet, trying to get it in tip-top shape. We had a real estate agent coming by that afternoon; we have been thinking of moving to a slightly larger closet in a slightly less-desirable location. She looked up at me, clearly still clueless. ""We're married... federally!"" I exclaimed. Mariann, who had given up all hope that the Supreme Court would get anything right that week, let out an uncharacteristic whoop. Our dog looked up at us, stretched slowly, then moved over a foot in order to stay in the shine of the sunbeam. (And isn't it fitting that on the same exact day, we would find out from our pink-pants-wearing real estate agent that the capital gains exemption -- to which we are now entitled in selling the apartment that Mariann has owned since the '80s -- would work in our favor, whereas the day before, it wouldn't have?) Many hours later, after a delectable vegan dinner, the two of us walked across a very crowded and jubilant Christopher Street, hand in hand. ""When did I get so old?"" I asked Mariann, who is 29 years my senior, so she glared at me. I heard a chorus of ""awww""s, and I looked over to see a dapper young man gingerly kissing the cheek of an amused female cop as his friends snapped photos. Another man poured beer into his friends' cups and proclaimed, ""We should yell 'hooray!' really loudly!"" For Mariann and me, our privilege as able-bodied humans living exactly where we want, eating three squares a day, and allowed to love whom we love is rarely lost on us. In fact, it sometimes gnaws at us relentlessly, kicking us in the gut and forcing us into action. In a world with so much suffering and inequality, it is hard to find victories. Even last week's historic turn of events is bittersweet when we think of how justice remains, in so many ways, elusive.But on that night, as the beautiful men next to us yelled ""hooray!"" and toasted with paper cups, the cops standing with them, right outside the Stonewall Inn -- in solidarity, not opposition -- and as Mariann and I walked, wordlessly connected, the sound of liberty rang out. The sense of irony that we had initially brought to our marriage silently slipped away, and we grasped each other's hands tighter than before. This is our moment. This is ours.Top photo by Sally Tamarkin"

It was something to be ashamed of, and something that meant that you had exhausted all other avenues for finding love. But today, online dating has become the second most popular way for couples to meet, eclipsed only by meeting through mutual acquaintances. So how, and more importantly, why did online dating become not only socially acceptable, but the preferred way of meeting new people?Cupid Goes DigitalExactly when and why this change occurred is a subject of debate. But according to Harry Reis, professor of psychology at who coauthored a 2012 study on online dating called Online Dating: A Critical Analysis From the Perspective of Psychological Science, the stigma surrounding online dating likely began to fade as people realized that it was not only a valid means of meeting new people, but also an altogether necessary change in how the Western world approaches romance. According to Reis, prior to the rise of online dating, the options for meeting new people were almost non-existent once we leave high school and college. ""Online dating is definitely a new and much needed twist on relationships,"" says study co-author Harry Reis, ""The Internet holds great promise for helping adults form healthy and supportive romantic partnerships, and those relationships are one of the best predictors of emotional and physical health.""The same study also conjectured that one of the main reasons for online dating's sudden increase in popularity lies in how people use these sites, and why.The Soulmate SearchAside from the simple fact that we now spend a good portion of our lives on the Internet, one of the biggest draws to online dating is obvious: access and information. With online dating sites, you immediately know that everyone you see is looking for a date, and immediately extract large amounts of information about that person before ever even speaking. As one dating site user succinctly put it, ""Where else can you go in a matter of 20 minutes [and] look at 200 women who are single and want to go on dates?""While late-20th century dating was notorious for being a ""hit and miss"" affair in which numerous dates are required before they can truly get an accurate assessment of their date, online dating sites have all but removed that problem by giving single people the ability to judge a person based off of a rudimentary description of themselves rather than just their appearance. On top of that, dating sites typically attempt to thin out the herd even further for you to find exactly the sort of person you're looking for. In addition to search metrics that can eliminate potential dates on the basis of lifestyle choices, such as religion or the use of recreational drugs, many sites have opted to try and find a means of immediately assessing how well you'd get along.Sites like OKCupid and Match.com use these matching systems, then encourage people to look for someone to potentially spend the rest of their lives with. Many have done exactly that. However, Reis and his research team caution that a combination of sites like these and ""soulmate beliefs"" can be a dangerous combination. ""People with strong beliefs in romantic destiny (sometimes called soulmate beliefs) -- that a relationship between two people either is or is not 'meant to be' -- are especially likely to exit a romantic relationship when problems arise ... and to become vengeful in response to partner aggression when they feel insecure in the relationship,"" the authors write.But not everyone is looking for a soulmate, and for those looking for something slightly less long-term than a life-long commitment have begun to use sites tailored towards their own desires. Sites that specifically allow for ""casual encounters"" and other strictly-sexual relationships have exploded in recent years as a result, especially for people with particularly non-mainstream fetishes who would otherwise have difficulty finding like-minded partners.However, even this is changing. With more people using the Internet on mobile devices than desktops or laptops, the world of online dating has now begun to blend into traditional dating in a way that many never full expected.Online Dating On the GoThe advent of smartphones may be responsible for the increased proliferation of online dating in today's world more than anything else. Now, not only can people browse through all the couples in their town like with standard dating websites, but mobile dating apps could take it a step further by showing you people looking for a date within your immediate area.One app in particular that became famous for such a feature is called Tinder. Rather than being forced to complete a long profile to get started, Tinder developed their app to simply browse photos and quickly select those who appeal to you. If the same person selects you too, the app makes the match and allows the two parties to start chatting in the app. Tinder targeted the college crowd and exploded across campuses nationwide It was a revolutionary approach to romance. Understandably, the concept has caught on. Another popular app using a similar methodology is Swoon, which is more popular with young, professional adults rather than students. Swoon is available on both Android and iOS, while Tinder currently is not, which puts Swoon in a strategic position to capture market share. Also, due to the fact that 70 percent of Android users are male, there's a larger selection of men for Swoon users to browse. These apps adopt a similar ""Zero Feet Away"" philosophy and allow users to go out and meet new people in the same way that previous generations did, but now with the ability to immediately know who around you is single and if the person is already interested in you.ConclusionApps like these are slowly changing how we view the dating ritual in modern society. With mobile technology becoming a bigger part of our lives every year, we can expect that the formerly anxiety-racked world of romance will soon give way to an easier, more relaxed means of finding love. It's already happening, so even those who swore that they would never ""resort"" to online dating may soon find themselves singing a much different tune."

CEO Kevin Tsujihara requesting that the studio back off from its attempt to force ""The Butler"" to change titles.""I have spent the last four years of my life working on the film, 'The Butler,' and it is the proudest moment of my professional career. I am heartbroken as I write this letter to you,"" Daniels wrote in the letter, which was provided to Deadline.com and also The Hollywood Reporter. ""If we were to change the title a mere six weeks before we open, it would most certainly hurt the film by limiting the number of people who would ultimately see this important story.""Daniels' film is based on the life of Eugene Allen, a White House staffer who served through eight administrations. Forest Whitaker stars in the film as the Allen stand-in, Cecil Gaines, and he's joined by an all-star cast that includes Oprah Winfrey, John Cusack, Robin Williams, Terrence Howard, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda. Daniels, who has pushed the envelope in films like ""Precious"" and ""The Paperboy,"" has said previously how difficult it was for him to even make a film like ""The Butler,"" which is likely to score a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (and, perhaps, Oscar nominations early next year).“I can’t go into my bag of tricks on this one: no urination, no baby falling down the stairs, no cursing at all,"" he told THR. ""We only have one ‘f-ck,’ which Lyndon Johnson gets. I felt like I directed the film in handcuffs and a muzzle.""Regardless of the process, ""The Butler"" is ready to go: The Weinstein Company has the film set for release on Aug. 16. The issue surrounding the film's title stems from the fact that Warner Bros. has a short film in its archive from 1916 that's also called ""The Butler."" As Variety reported, Warner Bros. won its arbitration case with the MPAA, but TWC has appealed the decision.""The Warner Bros, 1916 short has not been displayed or exhibited for almost a century and there is no plausible basis to contend that there is any chance of confusion between the two productions,"" TWC lawyer David Boies said in a letter to Warner Bros. and the MPAA (provided, again, to Deadline.com).It should be noted that many films have been released with the same title in the past, including Best Picture winners ""Gladiator"" and ""Crash.""To read Daniels' full letter to Warner Bros., head over to Deadline.com.[via Deadline.com]"

The firm describes their work as ""an intervention"" that can be ""summarized in three actions: extraction, re-description and addition."" In short, the team recovered the original spatial structure, reassigned each room with a different purpose and installed a mezzanine floor and a light structure on the roof.As design enthusiasts, we're fascinated by the clever partitions that resulted from their additions.

Frustration concept.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d4f702100003100c57891.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you've recently experienced a relationship breakup, regret is one of the many emotions you might be experiencing. But regret is usually just a form of temporary and needless pain. Here are a few perspectives to make the end of your relationship an exciting and bright start to a new beginning for you: There are a lot of things you don't miss. This might come as a surprise, but I've never met anybody who wanted actually wanted their ex back! Usually what people want is a loving, cleansed, varnish-free, more enlightened version of their ex. And unfortunately this fantasy doesn't exist or you'd still be together. If you were the one who ended the relationship, remember you did this for a reason! Something wasn't working with your ex partner or the relationship you had. If it wasn't your choice to end the relationship, you might be missing a version of your ex who loves and appreciates you more and can pull off a better way to dealing with conflict than running out the door. It's easy to reflect on the positive parts of a person or a relationship once it's ended; but remember, that's only one part of the story. If you're missing parts of the relationship, don't forget about all the things you don't miss. There's a moral to your story. The end of one relationship is a great time to take a look and rediscover what you really want. Whether or not you're willing to admit it, the relationship ended because it wasn't working. And if your relationship was working only for you -- that's not enough. The good news is there's probably a lesson to be learned. Was there something you discovered about yourself regarding what you want or need so that your next relationship isn't a repeat of this pattern when you're ready to move on? While things are fresh in your mind, make a list of these insights and resolve to follow them in this most important part of your life. And if you find that you are labeling yourself a ""failure"" or putting yourself down in some other way; remember that relationships don't fail, they run their course. Sometimes one or both partners outgrow each other or the relationship ends for one or more of a million other reasons. But it's your choice as to whether the breakup remains a source of pain for you or an invaluable basis for personal growth. You now get to focus on yourself. Being single frees some space for you to reconnect with yourself and perhaps others in your life that you may have had little time for. Maybe with the gift of time that follows a breakup, there's a new area you'd like to cultivate: a hobby you enjoy, a project around the house you've been putting off or a trip you'd like to take that didn't fit in with you ended relationship. My book Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential might be a good place to start evaluating and either tweaking or making major changes to various parts of your life. And, there's no better time to start than today! Discover new outlets. What is it that you liked about your relationship? Is there a way to find or replace that in your life with something else? For example, if it was nice to have someone to debrief your workday with each evening, maybe you can reach out to friends or coworkers to meet for happy hour after work or grab dinner. If there was a certain activity you liked to do with your ex, find a way to continue this. Perhaps join a group of people in your area with similar interests to yours. If you and your ex went running on the weekends or enjoyed seeing movies, join a running or film club. Even more importantly, don't be afraid to try certain activities by yourself that you may have only done as part of a couple; such as going to a nice restaurant, the theatre or ballet. We all have the power to pick our attitudes. Look upon being free of a relationship that wasn't working as a good thing. Expect sad moments here and there, but don't forget that the relationship you're ending was not without pain either. By utilizing your inner resources and the sources of support you already have around you, resolve to make this breakup the start of an exciting new beginning!For more by Michael S.

It was a memorable trip in so many ways, but on the food side the most striking thing was how traditional the menus were: On the coast, there was fish and little meat; inland there was hardly any fish at all (except dried or salted), but plenty of meat, both farmed and wild. That's powerfully old-fashioned, and I wonder whether it still holds true.I retain two specific cooking discoveries that I still act on regularly: from Palermo, tuna cooked through rather than being served rare or raw the way we tend to do it in the U.S. nowadays; and from some hilltop village toward the center of the island, one of the best no-cook desserts ever. This was fluffy sheep's milk ricotta with the most crazily flavorful honey we'd ever had and some toasted nuts for a little crunch.""Fluffy sheep's milk ricotta""; ""crazily flavorful honey"": clearly, the quality of the ingredients was what made this so good. Luckily, those of us who live near farmers' markets can sometimes find what's needed. Last week, I got a basket of excellent ricotta from Dancing Ewe Farm; it is packaged in such a way that it continues to drain as you keep it in the fridge, which is a fine idea. (I've had delicious sheep ricotta from 3-Corner Field Farm and Valley Shepherd Creamery too.) And I bought a jar of dark, complex Connecticut buckwheat honey from Andrew's Honey.If you know ricotta only from the supermarket dairy case, you probably think of it as a damp and tasteless thing good only as a foil for tastier ingredients in lasagne or ravioli, or as the basis of a cheesecake batter. The kind I'm talking about here is quite different: It tastes of fresh ewe's milk and pasture, and it has a soft springiness that gives special pleasure in the eating. I also got hold of some good shelled walnuts; these I put into a skillet over low heat and toasted them lightly just until they began to smell aromatic.And that was dessert: An egg-sized blob of ricotta; a generous tablespoon of honey; a few toasted walnuts, with more honey and nuts brought to the table for refills.If you can get the makings, you will amaze your guests -- and yourself. Except those of you who've been to Sicily or another sheep-raising region that makes such good use of the local milk. (Leftover ricotta? The plan for ours is to drop blobs of it onto a dish of pasta dressed with fresh tomatoes, herbs and olive oil.)"

Family drama, bad presents and embarrassing Christmas sweaters be gone! The beauty of Independence Day is the low-key and relaxed atmosphere that surrounds the smell of burgers and the exhilaration of fireworks. So, who in America celebrates this patriotic holiday the best? We unearthed activities on both sides of the country to determine the top four activities that will help establish the winner of this battle royale! Vote in the comments section below to let us know what you think...Activities in the East The East coast is full of 4th of July activities; from firework shows to historic tours, to beer tasting and family bike trips, the selection was plentiful! It was a tough decision for us to make but below are the final four. 1. Freedom Trail Walking Tour in Boston Historically accurate and educational, this two mile guided tour weaves throughout historic landmarks, guiding visitors through the Boston Freedom Trail. What could be a better fit for the 4th of July than learning about the people who shaped our nation?   2. Monument Bike Tour in Washington DC It wouldn't be right to exclude Washington DC from our top four list. And the best way to see the capital of our great country? By bike! This four mile bike tour of Washington's most famous monuments includes the Washington Monument, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, World War II Memorial, Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and more. And don't worry about getting lost; you'll be accompanied by a friendly, professional guide the entire time.3. Moonlight Sail in Philadelphia One of the best ways to experience the fireworks is on the water! In Philly you can set sail on an authentic, junk-rigged ocean schooner. Bring your favorite bottle of wine and watch as the sun dips below the horizon and stars light up the night sky.4. Discover Brooklyn's Breweries in New York Very few things scream 4th of July more than Beer. On this NYC tour, you can celebrate the holiday by taking a behind-the-scenes tour of a Brooklyn brewery, enjoying beer tastings and pizza lunch and learning about the history of brewery from pre-prohibition to present day.Activities in the West It seems as though the East would have a leg up on celebrating our Independence, if not entirely due to its historical tours, but we have yet to be convinced. We found activities in the West that rival all of the best activities on the East. Below are the strongest competitors. What do you think?1. Pearl Harbor & WWII Experience in Hawaii Think historical, patriotic tours are only for the East? Think again. In Hawaii you can see the sights and hear the stories that surround Oahu's WWII experience, from Pearl Harbor to the military sites around the island. While Independence was earned by the East, it's been kept by the West. 2. Biplane and Warbird Rides in San Diego Want an activity with a little more excitement? Try the ""You-Fly-It"" Air Dogfight in San Diego. The best part? No experience necessary. You'll be paired with a military pilot during this aerial combat mission in a WWII-era place. Come on... this one is pretty cool!3. Kayak Tour in San Francisco While watching the fireworks from a boat can be incredibly romantic, watching them from a Kayak brings a whole new level of exhilaration. This kayak tour, suitable for all levels, explores the world-class postcard-perfect San Francisco waterfront, as well as the beautiful landmarks of the bay. Oh, and we promise that though they may appear to, the fireworks won't actually rain down on you!  4. Zip Line Tour in Catalina Whether with your whole family or a group of friends, propelling down five separate zip lines at 45mph through Catalina's hills and canyons is one of the best ways we can think of to celebrate this American holiday. Visitors then have the option to explore the Beach Club and relax by the ocean, enjoying the fireworks over dinner and drinks.So what do you think? Who celebrates the 4th of July best... the East or the West?"
