(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Girl Scouts of the USA)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9de7412200005700d9cec8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"First appeared on Food Riot, by Kit SteinkellnerA bajillion props to the Girl Scout who decided to sell cookies outside of a medical marijuana dispensary. That's the kind of out-of-the-box (pun absolutely intended) thinking that leads to future Einsteins and Zuckerbergs. I bet that troop made a bejeezus load of money by being in the right place at the right time peddling the right merch.Which got me thinking: Where else should Girl Scouts be selling their cookies? I always see them outside the grocery store, which isn't the worst move (kid sees cookies coming in, whines about them in the cart the entire time their mom is buying groceries, when parent and child come out of the store mom is bullied by child into buying Thin Mints and she's so sick of the tantrum-ing she just gives in, that's how parenting works, right?) Still, as in The Case of Why Aren't More Girl Scout Troops Setting Up Shops Outside Marijuana Dispensaries, I've got to think there are bigger, better places our Scouts should be selling their wares. Below a list.HIGH SCHOOLSThink of that $20 bill from allowance burning a hole in that teenager's pocket. Now multiply that teenager by 500 or 2,000 and you've got a large consumer population with a high metabolism, a little disposable income, and no parents (on campus). If those scouts hustled from their middle school right as the bell rang, they'd catch their older sisters and brothers right before sports practice/play rehearsal/detention/etc.THE DMVThe DMV is so boring and depressing and anyone waiting in line to get their license or renew their registration or whatever other bullshit you do at the DMV and while you're waiting, like, two hours to fill out one f--ing form, you can slip outside for three minutes and buy a box of samoas because you're a good person and you don't deserve to wait in line at the DMV, no one does, only warlords and child slavers deserve that fate, so of course you're going to soften the blow of a wasted morning with a box of cookies and of course you're going to eat half the box while you're waiting for B24 or whatever-the-f number you are to be called.THE COUNTY COURTHOUSEThe same basic idea as the DMV, there are a lot of people going to the courthouse for boring or sad reasons (or boring and sad, worst of the worst) and could use a little bit of sunshine in the form of cuties and cookies.THE LIBRARYActually, I have seen the Girl Scout booth outside my local bookstore and I think it's a great call because I have my stack of books and that makes me want a stack of snacks. That said, the library's a better move. Because after I've left a bookstore, I've probably spent $15 to $50, and then an addition $20 on top of that is... more money spent. But when I leave the library, I've spent no money -- well, maybe $5 in late fees if I've had a particularly spacey month, but still, I haven't spent any money on books -- so I'm much more likely to spend it on sweets. Also, can you guys imagine the profits a Girl Scout troop could make swarming the library after story hour? Bank on bank on bank!PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICEThink of all the sad kids getting shots and stomping out of the doctor's office prepared to take all their rage out on their parents for the rest of the day. And think of how much less those kids would hate their parents if said parents bought said children a box of cookies. You're welcome, Parents of America Just Trying to Get Through The Day and Keep Your Kids Vaccinated Against Terrifying Diseases.RETIREMENT COMMUNITIESI heard that once you get to be super-old you can say and do -- and most importantly, eat -- whatever you want because bikini season at 25 is a very different thing from bikini season at 84. Plus, how are a bunch of old people not going to love a bunch of button-nosed cuties tromping in and distributing refined sugar? It can be a combo community service/cookie buying day!MOVIE THEATERSPeople sneak in their own snacks into movie theaters all the time (that's what big purses are for) so it makes so much sense for Girl Scouts to position themselves right across the street from the movie theater as the leading choice of snack to be snuck in. And if the ushers check your bag (which they never do) or give you a hard time (which they shouldn't, because you're probably an adult and they're probably 14), just slip them cookies instead of hush up money and be on your merry way.Anyone else have any ideas re: where Girl Scouts should be selling their cookies?Read more on Food Riot"
1,WELLNESS,Monks Have Found The Key To A Productive Workday And A Fulfilling Life (And It Includes Beer),Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tk-things-that-monks-make_us_5b9ddd5fe4b03a1dcc8de7f1,"Soap ""With two small crock pots and four molds, the most he can make is 100 bars a day, and he can barely keep up with demand",2014-02-27,"BERLIN, Germany: A vendor, dressed as a monk, serves Dutch 'Trappist' beer at the International 'Gruene Woche' agricultural trade fair in Berlin 17 January 2006. Trappist beer is traditionally made by trappist monks. AFP PHOTO JOHN MACDOUGALL (Photo credit should read JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ddd5f3c000032000a502c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When we think of monks, we tend to think of austerity, solitude and long days spent chanting and praying. And while the focus of their daily lives is devotional activity, many monks manage to be extremely productive in a way you might not expect: running successful businesses. The discovery of this fact left a lasting impression on August Turak. After a skydiving accident caused a wake-up call that led him to reevaluate the way he was working and living, the former MTV executive began visiting a Trappist monastery in South Carolina, and became fascinated by the way the monks ran their businesses. Turak, who later wrote a book on the subject, Business Secrets of the Trappist Monks: One CEO’s Quest for Meaning and Authenticity, said that the selfless nature of the monks' work was the real secret to their success. He also explained that for the monks, work-life integration is seamless: ""The monks don’t worry about balancing work and prayer; they are equally important. Work is a form of prayer, and prayer is a form of work. I found that one of the best praying times I had was while I was at work, standing at an assembly line. Your ordinary life is your spiritual life. Every single challenge can be an opportunity for transformation if you look at it in the right way.""Trappist monks do live by the Benedictine motto ora et labora, ""pray and work,"" as well as the principle that they should ""live by the work of their hands.""  By this tradition, work -- though separate from prayer -- is also an act of selflessness and devotion. Here are five examples of the work done by Trappist and Buddhist monks, proving that any kind of work can be a labor of love. BeerTrappist monks are famous for making beer (and they have a reputation for great products), although up until recently, all certified Trappist breweries were located in Europe. But this year, St. Joseph's Abbey in Western Massachusetts created its Spencer Trappist Ale, the first certified Trappist beer to be brewed outside Europe. The St. Joseph's monks learned about the brewing process from a local brewer and obtained funding for a state-of-the-art brewing facility. For the recipe, they settled on a low-alcohol variety of refectory ale.""The recipe allows monks to drink them on occasion and still go on and do monastic things,"" Reverend Isaac Keeley, the brewery's director, told NPR. ""Ours is a golden-hued, full-bodied ale. It has a nice aroma, which kind of whets your appetite.""Currently, the beer is only for sale within the state, but the monks are hoping to expand their business in the future. Sand MandalasTibetan Buddhist monks can spend weeks creating the large, intricately crafted sand mandalas -- an ancient, sacred art form dating back more than 20,000 years. Known as dul-tson-kyil-khor, or ""mandala of colored powders,"" the creations -- which are often destroyed right after they are made -- represent the cycle of birth and death (samsara) and the nature of impermanence. ""Millions of grains of sand are painstakingly laid into place on a flat platform over a period of days or weeks,"" the Dalai Lama's public talks website explains. ""Formed of a traditional prescribed iconography that includes geometric shapes and a multitude of ancient spiritual symbols, the sand-painted mandala is used as a tool for re-consecrating the earth and its inhabitants."" Watch this incredible stop motion timelapse video of TIbetan Buddhist monks creating a sand mandala to see the process for yourself. Bread When they're not occupied with prayer, the 30 Trappist monks living at the Abbey of the Genesee in western New York make ""Monks' Bread"" and other baked good for sale both at the monastery and online. The monastery also sells coffee, preserves, nut butters, teas, sauces and granola made by the monks. In addition to sharing the work of making the bread and food, the monks also help with farming, cooking, cleaning and hospitality. SoapThe monks at Saint Joseph Abbey in Southern Louisiana and many others spend their days making artisanal soaps, which they sell as appropriately-named ""Monk soap."" According to the Abbey's website, the demand for the soap has been growing, and one monk, Brother Andrew, now occupies much of his time with creating new bars. ""With two small crock pots and four molds, the most he can make is 100 bars a day, and he can barely keep up with demand,"" the Abbey writes. ""These days, he says, ""It's a small operation, but brother, business is booming!"" He thinks it might slow down after Christmas, but we all believe that's his way of being humble, and demand is only going to rise."" CasketsAt New Melleray Abbey in Iowa, a Catholic monastery that's over 160 years old, making wooden caskets is a way of life. The monks create each casket with their signature ""old-world craftsmanship"" and an aesthetic of simplicity, crafted out of wood harvested from the trees in the forest surrounding the Abbey. Each urn and casket is blessed by a monk, and the abbey offers memorial services for each person who is buried in them.BartendingIn Tokyo, you can get a little dose of spirituality with your beer or whiskey at Vow'z Bar, a local watering hole run by Buddhist priests. Although the bar may not comply with some of the traditional rules of Buddhism, its owner explains that the bar is an accessible place for people to connect with their spirituality. ""When people have had a few drinks, it’s often easier to communicate with them on spiritual matters here than it is talking at a temple,"" Yoshinobu Fujioka, Buddhist priest and owner of Vow'z Bar, told CNN Travel. Fujioka hails from the more liberal True Pure Land school of Buddhism. In addition to daily happy hours, the bar hosts gatherings where people can come and discuss the teachings of Buddhism. "
2,PARENTING,Two Toy Trends on the Horizon,"Dana Holmes, Contributor

From super modern ride-ons to a girly LEGO world to gateway toys hoping to scoop up toddlers and usher them on to already hugely popular toys for older kids, there were a bunch of trends that I couldn't help noticing. And yet, there are a few trends that are just starting to show themselves. These are trends that will most likely slowly expand over the next couple of years into more and more products. But, for now, just a select group of major toy makers are dipping their ""toys"" in the water and seeing if they can jump start trends from scratch. Rainbows and UnicornsNo, I can't separate them. They are a unified force when it comes to this toy trend. You might be thinking that rainbows and unicorns have always been awesome. And, that's true. But the toy world has pretty much neglected them for a long time. Coming soon are a handful of toy unicorns and dolls who have pet unicorns. Who knows, maybe Rainbow Bright will make a come back next year! PoopYup, I said it. Poop is an odd trend for little girls. Boys, I get. But girls? Believe it. I was surprised at how many pooping creatures there will be for girls to play with. Even the girliest toy of all time, Barbie, has a pooping golden retriever named Taffy that your little girl can clean up after with a pink pooper scooper. Moxie Girlz Poopsy Pets are an entire line of girls' toys that poop. The pièce de résistance is Kellan who has a magical pet unicorn that poops rainbow eggs. At least they're teaching kids to clean up after their pets, which is more than I can say for a lot of people here in Brooklyn. So, now you know what to keep an eye out for if you have a little girl. There's no doubt that at some point over the next couple of years she'll be begging for a toy that follows one or both these trends. --Dana Holmes is a lifestyle, gift and etiquette expert and contributor to the Gift Rap Blog.

3,TRAVEL,Safari Beyond the Game Drive,"Elizabeth Gordon, Contributor
Founder of Extraordinary Journeys, Leading Luxury Tour Operator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/safari-beyond-the-gamedri_us_5b9de5d8e4b03a1dcc8e5846,"While wild animals may be nervous of human beings on foot or in a vehicle, they are more relaxed around horses because they disguise your smell. Traveling on horseback also allows you to explore beyond the reach of roads.",2014-02-27,2014-02-26-SingitaGrumeti_HorseBackSafari_Resize.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-26-SingitaGrumeti_HorseBackSafari_Resize-thumb.jpg,"If you are sitting at your desk wishing you were on safari, you are probably visualizing yourself sitting in a Land Rover taking a photo of a lion or an elephant that is just inches away.  Bull Elephant at Serian Mara Camp, Kenya (Photo courtesy of Serian Camps)Do not get me wrong, game drives are a great way to see animals while on safari and are guaranteed to be a highlight, but on a 14-day safari they can get old. Here is a list of exciting alternatives to game-drives that will still give you great access to animals.1) Bush Walks & Walking Safaris Getting out on foot is all about the small things you might miss in a vehicle; identifying scat, following tracks, looking at insects, smelling wild sage, learning how termite mounds are made. You might see some large game as well: elephants, giraffes or buffalo, and being on foot will give you a unique perspective on their size. Walking is also an incredible opportunity to take in the sounds of the bush; you don't realize how loud the vehicle is until the engine is off.   Bush Walk at Chem Chem Safari Lodge, Tanzania (Photo courtesy of Chem Chem)Bush walks are offered across East and Southern Africa and finding a property that offers walking as half-day activity is fairly easy. You often cannot walk inside national parks so you may need to stay in a property in a private conservancy or concession. Properties in Kenya and Zambia have particularly good walking programs. Multi-day walks are harder to come-by, but they do exist. We love the multi-day programs with the Maasai in Kenya offered by Alex Walker and Maasai Trails. 2) Horseback Safaris A safari on horseback is an incredible experience because you are able to get so close to the animals. While wild animals may be nervous of human beings on foot or in a vehicle, they are more relaxed around horses because they disguise your smell. Traveling on horseback also allows you to explore beyond the reach of roads and offers many of the advantages of walking such as the silence. There are many horseback safari options in East and Southern Africa, offering everything from lessons and one to two hour rides to 10-day horseback camping adventures in the bush. Kenya and South Africa have lots of properties that offer a few hours of horseback riding and there are excellent multi-day trips in Kenya, Tanzania Botswana, South Africa and Namibia. Find more here. Horseback Safari at Singita Grumeti Reserve, Tanzania (Photo courtesy of Singita)3) Camel-Back Safaris Similar to horseback safaris, camel-back safaris disguise the human scent and allow you to get closer to wild animals, and their height gives you a unique perspective. If a camel back safari appeals to you, the Laikipia Plateau of Northern Kenya is pretty much where you have to be. Some of our favorite properties that offer camel safaris are Ol Malo, Sabuk and Sosian. Many of these properties also offer overnight camel or horseback fly-camping safaris as well. Camels at Ol Malo, Laikipia, Kenya, (Photo courtesy of Ol Malo)4) Elephant-Back Safaris Like horses and camels, elephants disguise human scent and offer an incredibly unique perspective on the bush. Also you are on an elephant! Unlike camels, you need to be in Southern Africa specifically South Africa, Botswana (at Abu Camp) or around Victoria Falls in Zambia and Zimbabwe to experience an elephant-back safari. Find out more here. Abu Camp, Okavango Delta, Botswana (Photo courtesy of Wilderness Safaris)5) Canoes and Mokoros Getting out on the water is a great way to see the smaller plant and animal life Africa has to offer. It is a particularly good activity for birders. Canoeing is offered by properties along the Zambezi in Zambia while mokoros (a dugout canoe steered by a ""poler"") are specific to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Crocs and hippos are a real danger when canoeing so you will need an excellent guide! This is less of a concern with mokoros as they are typically used in channels and flood plains too shallow for hippos and crocs because the pole needs to be able to touch the bottom to propel the boat forward. There is a multi-day canoe trip offered by Great Plains Conservation on the Selinda in Northern Botswana when water levels allow.   Mokoro at Little Vumbura, Okavango Delta, Botswana (Photo courtesy of Wilderness Safaris)6) Hot Air Balloons The best way to take in the vastness and scale of East Africa's wildebeest migration is from a hot air balloon. Kenya and Tanzania are the easiest places to build a hot air balloon ride into your safari, but ballooning is also offered at Soussusvlei, Namibia and in Kafue National Park in Zambia during August and September. A good hot air balloon ride ends with a champagne breakfast!  Hot Air Balloon Over the Migration, (Photo courtesy of Serian Camps)7) Helicopter It is not a cheap option but a week long helicopter trip over Northern Kenya and Ethiopia with Tropic Air is a once in a lifetime experience. If you don't have the budget for that, you can take a ride that is anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour over Victoria Falls and actually get some game-viewing in as you pass over Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, in addition to stunning views of the Falls  Tropic Air Helicopter, Ethiopia (Photo courtesy of Tropic Air)One of a kind...8) Micro-Light On a recent trip to Zambia I did a micro-light flight over South Luangwa National Park. In addition to being really fun it was a great way to see game because it flies much lower than a plane, helicopter or hot air balloon. The only place you can experience a micro-light is at Tafika Camp in South Luangwa and Tafika Camp's owner John Coppinger has to be around for the flights to happen because he is the pilot.  Micro-light at Tafika Camp, South Luangwa, Zambia (Photo courtesy of Remote Africa)9) Bi-Plane Like the micro-light a bi-plane is a great way to see game because it moves slower and flies lower than a plane or a helicopter. If you want to see elephants from the seat of a bi-plane Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya is the only place you can do it and the only pilot you can use is Will Craig, one of the founders of the Conservancy. If this is something you want to do, be sure to mention it early on in planning your trip.

4,HOME & LIVING,9 Reasons To Bring Back Cocktail Parties (PHOTOS),Brie Dyas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reasons-to-bring-back-cocktail-parties_us_5b9de635e4b03a1dcc8e5b1d,"8. No. Bathroom. Lines. In our grandparents' day, people dressed up to go to a friends' house for cocktails. Would it kill",2014-02-27,"1959 June 19 - Jo Noske, Amsterdam - Franￃﾧois Truffaut, at cocktail party for Arnhem premiere of ",https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4132/4844455769_236d37ec67_b.jpg,"Your grandparents probably enjoyed one trend that has sadly since died a thousand deaths: The cocktail party. These gatherings dominated the 1950s and 1960s, then fell by the wayside for a variety of reasons. The hub of socialization shifted away from the living room and into bars, which poses limitations (time, energy and money, mainly). But I think it's time to bring back the cocktail party. Here's why.1. You can drink what you want, without paying a ridiculous sum.  I remember being aghast when the price of a cocktail hit $11 -- and now we live in the era of the $15 martini. Even dives are raising their prices. Of course, I'm in the NYC region, where the cost of living has replaced pickpockets as the thing most likely to take all your money. Even still, when you think about a budget martini and the dubious ingredients mingling in the glass, wouldn't it be much better to get one bottle of really good gin, rather than spend that money on bad drinks?2. Going out on a Friday or Saturday night will erode your faith in humanity. When you finally get everyone's schedules together, you're likely to agree that Friday or Saturday night is the best time to see friends. Guess who has the same idea? Everyone in the world. Particularly loud, obnoxious types. Bars and restaurants try to drown them out with people who DJ from Macbooks. It would be horrible, if you could get a spot to sit in the first place. 3. You can use those fancy glasses you got on your registry/found at a thrift store. We all have them, but they're likely gathering dust. If they're going to take up space, you might as well put them to use.4. You can accommodate your friends' food allergies/intolerances/dietary restrictions.Some friends are a Russian nesting doll of specifics. They won't eat at Restaurant A because they're gluten-free now. They can't go to Restaurant B because they garnish everything with cilantro. They can't go to Restaurant C because it's too far to walk. You get the drill.4.a. No ""surprise"" cilantro. O.K. it's not like there's a cilantro epidemic, but it's more about the unanticipated cilantro. It's the time you ordered a margarita and it came with jalapeno slices in it. It's the time the bartender got creative with a Manhattan and somehow garnished it with sweet potato puree (!!). It's ordering a burger, only to be told that you can only have it with a cheese that's $5 extra. Some people love the element of surprise, others don't. If you're with a group of at least 4 others, there's bound to be someone who doesn't.5. You can stay as long as you like.No one is popping by to say ""Can I get you anything else?"" in a not-so-subtle way to turn over your table.6. You can actually have a conversation. Not only because the noise factor is way less bothersome at home, but because there isn't a stranger pressed up against you while you're trying to discuss the latest work gossip.7. You can dress to impress...or not. In our grandparents' day, people dressed up to go to a friends' house for cocktails. Would it kill us to raise the bar on everyday dress now and then? No. But I digress. In the comfort of home, you can comfortably dress up or dress down. No hobbling down the sidewalk in heels. No self-consciousness because you're one of those people who would rather wear flip-flops everywhere. It works for all types.8. No. Bathroom. Lines.Along with the questionable nature of the bathroom once you finally reach it. Even if it's a nice place, when you get lots of people and give them lots of food and drink, the bathroom situation devolves faster than you can say, ""Is this the line to the bathroom?"" Save yourself the hassle and the shower you'll need later by hosting the party at home.9. As a kid, there's nothing more interesting than overhearing cocktail party chatter. And then imitating your parents (and their friends) behind their backs. The point here isn't ""do it for the children!"" but more like being able to have fun in one's own home. Stop making excuses about babysitters, decor, whatever. Just have people over."

Ireland?s government won?t recall beef tainted with dioxins because the amount isn?t a health risk. (Photo by Paul Mcerlane/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9de6593c000032000a5341.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The nearly 9 million pounds of beef recalled from a California slaughterhouse this month may have come from cows sick with cancer, inside sources are now claiming.Rancho Feeding Corp., currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture after inspectors demanded the processing plant recall a year’s worth of beef, was allegedly purchasing dairy cows sick with eye cancer, decapitating them to hide the disease from inspectors and illegally selling the beef, an anonymous source told the San Francisco Chronicle.""Rancho, we're told, was slaughtering them, somehow after hours or in other ways where the inspector didn't know about it,"" the source revealed. ""Because the carcass looked good, (Rancho) mixed it back in with other beef that it sold under its label.""USDA officials do not comment on ongoing investigations, and Rancho’s lawyers have forbidden employees from speaking to the media.Bill Niman, the former owner of Niman Ranch who is widely considered a pioneer of humane and sustainable livestock farming, processed his cattle at Rancho and subsequently had his entire 2013 output recalled, even though he says his product was totally separate from the tainted meat in question. Based on conversations he had with USDA officials and others in the ranching community, he also speculates the plant may have been processing cows with eye cancer, noting that it is one of the only facilities that slaughters retired dairy cows, which are often in poor health.""A farmer sends a cow in with cancer, and he knows it has cancer-eye -- it's a growth on the eye, this is not a microbial situation,"" he told the Village Voice. ""The inspectors, they know it has cancer-eye. So the farmer shouldn't have sent it, and the inspector should have caught it.""An unnamed federal food inspector at the plant also cited a breakdown in responsibility, alleging that the supervising USDA veterinarian ignored her warnings against slaughtering some cows during a five-month period last year.“She would tag animals for the PHV (public health veterinarian) and what she thought sometimes were cancerous, the vet would pass … And she can't question the vet,” Paul Carney, president of the federal meat inspectors union, told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.But amid all of this, no one has reported getting sick from the meat, and experts say cows with eye cancer are not necessarily dangerous to eat unless the cancer has spread to other organs. ""If I'm out on top of Mount Everest and have a cow (with eye cancer) and I'm hungry, I'm going to cook her well and deal with getting down the mountain,"" James Cullor, professor of population health and reproduction at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis, told the Chronicle. ""But if I'm here in this country, I will choose to not consume the animal. I wouldn't feed the animal to my grandchildren."" "
