A selection of annotated first edition books from the Worlds greatest living illustrators and authors including contributions from Michael Bond, Raymond Briggs, Quentin Blake, Lauren Child, Terry Gilliam, Judith Kerr, Paula Rego & Gerald Scarfe are to be auctioned to Raise Money for 'House of Illustration' on December 8, 2014.

Scientists (and those of us who agree with them) passionately want everyone to understand how they reached their conclusions, and how solid and credible those conclusions are. It is, however, well known that the answer to ""I don't trust science"" is not ""let me tell you some more science."" So what's a science-loving scientist to do? Well, one answer is: tell a story.When my kids were little, I loved reading to them. Of all the books we read together, my very, very favorite remains The BFG by Roald Dahl. Not as well-known as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Matilda, The BFG is the tale of an unlikely friendship between an eight-year-old orphan girl named Sophie, and a ""nice and jumbly"" giant who calls himself ""The Big Friendly Giant"" (or BFG for short) to distinguish himself from the other Giants, who go ""zipfizzing off"" from Giant country every night to ""guzzle human beans.""OK, so it might be a little grizzly for some parents' taste, but my children loved the word play, the suspense, and the whizbang ending where Sophie, the BFG, and the Queen of England... well, I won't ruin it for you, but trust me, it's a winksquiffler.Loving the book so much, I was deeply touched when I learned recently that Dahl lost a seven-year old daughter, Olivia, to the measles in 1962. The BFG, published in 1982, is dedicated to Olivia. In an open letter written in 1986, Dahl tells the story of his daughter's heartbreakingly rapid and unexpected death from one of measles' rare complications -- encephalitis -- and pleads with parents to vaccinate their children, an option that was not available to Dahl (the first measles vaccine was not widely available until 1963). It is tragic that Dahl's letter, which encouraged parents to overcome their fears, has once again become relevant.Ironically, in his letter, Dahl held up America as a model to his fellow Britons, noting that ""in America, where measles immunisation is compulsory, measles, like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.""Indeed, as detailed in a 2004 article, ""Measles Elimination in the United States"", between 1982 and 1988, measles incidence in the U.S. dropped to 1.3 cases per 100,000 population -- down from over 300 cases per 100,000 during 1956-1960. A resurgence in 1989-1991 was met with a redoubled effort to extend the reach of vaccination, including increasing the recommended number of doses of vaccine and beginning the vaccination series before the age of two years. The intensified efforts succeeded in reducing the incidence of measles by another order of magnitude to Thus it would be deeply distressing to Dahl (were he alive; he passed away in 1990) that unfounded fear -- combined with increased recourse to a large loophole in the regulations that aim to make vaccination compulsory -- has allowed measles to return. Parental worries about vaccine safety, though arising from genuine love and concern for their children, are utterly unsupported by the evidence. So many parents have lately chosen to give in to these unfounded fears that almost 700 children in the U.S. contracted measles in 2014, and already there have been over 120 cases in 2015. Thank goodness, death from the disease is quite rare (about one in a thousand cases), but it is only a matter of time before another American mother and father could be writing a letter like Dahl's. Indeed, about 145,000 families worldwide mourned the death of a child from measles in 2014.The greatest risk involved in the measles vaccine is a severe allergic reaction, which occurs in less than 1 out of a million doses. So how do we convince parents that the risk from measles (1-2 deaths per 1000 cases) more than justifies the ""risk"" of vaccination? The torrent of studies show that the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine is safe and that autism is just as common among the unvaccinated as the vaccinated. But these facts are of limited use in persuading some parents to vaccinate their children. Indeed, a recent study (behind a pay wall, but results discussed here) showed that exposing parents to more scientific data just reinforces their fears. So how do we persuade parents to do the right thing?Well, if people are afraid -- and it is fear that underlies the refusal to vaccinate -- they don't need to be badgered or sneered at, they need to be reassured. And that reassurance comes best from someone they trust. Or preferably from lots of someones they trust. If not Roald Dahl, perhaps a neighbor, co-worker, or friend -- especially an older person who might remember what it was like before vaccines.No doubt pediatricians will be the front line in efforts to return the vaccination rate to the levels that kept the U.S. free of measles for almost 30 years. Vaccination requirements are set at the state level. States tend to follow the recommendations of the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention, requiring a full set of vaccinations before entry into public school. Many states, however, allow parents to claim a ""personal belief"" exemption with little or no justification. Some of these states, like California, are wisely considering tightening up the process for granting such exemptions, and requiring a pediatrician to certify that there is a valid medical reason for declining or delaying vaccination. The process of requesting an exemption will give pediatricians an opportunity to allay parents' fears. As I re-read The BFG recently, with Dahl's terrible loss in mind, it wasn't hard to recognize the ""cannybully and murderful"" giants as metaphors for childhood diseases -- galloping around the world and devouring children night after night. By the end of the book, Sophie and the BFG's clever and courageous plan has resulted in the giants' capture and imprisonment in a deep pit, where they are condemned to dine no longer on children but on the disgusterous and foulsome snozzcumber. Just what they deserve.Dahl exhorted parents to do the right thing and keep the giants safely at bay almost 30 years ago. I will give him the last words, from his 1986 letter:""Incidentally, I dedicated two of my books to Olivia, the first was James and the Giant Peach. That was when she was still alive. The second was The BFG, dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles. You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children."""

Rick Snyder is seen before proposing his state budget, Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2015 in Lansing, Mich. The governor proposed a $54 billion state budget that he said prioritizes education and health services, including focus on improved reading for third graders, more training in the skilled trades and increased dental coverage for low-income children. The Republican governor's plan for the fiscal year starting in October would increase spending by roughly $2 billion, or 3.8 percent, mostly because of higher federal funding. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e96a2400005100577847.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An agreement between Canada and the United States should pave the way for construction to begin on a bridge between Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario. It also shoulders Canada with more of the costs. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Canadian Transport Minister Lisa Riatt separately announced Wednesday that officials had hammered out crucial remaining details for the New International Trade Crossing, which will span the Detroit River between Detroit and Windsor. The Canadian public-private partnership overseeing the entire bridge project will now pay for a $250 million customs plaza on the Detroit side; it previously agreed to cover the rest of the initial costs of the $2.1 billion construction project. For putting up the money, Canada will be repaid through bridge tolls. In a statement, Riatt called the bridge a top infrastructure priority for Canada and said the agreement “allows Canada and Michigan to move the project forward immediately to its next steps which include further design work and property acquisition on the U.S. side of the border.”Michigan lawmakers had originally hoped the federal government would kick in funds for the U.S. customs plaza, and Gov. Rick Snyder (R) said in September he thought it was “offensive” to ask Canada to foot the bill. According to the Detroit News, President Barack Obama has said in the past that congressional restrictions on allocating funding for specific projects made it difficult to include money for the customs plaza in the federal budget.The customs facility will be staffed, operated and maintained by the U.S., according to the new agreement. DHS officials said it will take an estimated $100 million to manage the customs plaza in the first year, and $50 million annually in following years. Snyder and Michigan Democratic Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters praised the step forward Wednesday and individually vowed to make sure the government keeps up its end of the deal. “As a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, I will continue working with the Obama administration, the Snyder administration, the Canadian Government and my colleagues in Congress to ensure the U.S. fulfills our commitment to fully staff and operate this new border crossing that will have a significant economic impact for Michigan and states across the country,"" Peters said in a statement.The bridge is set to be completed by 2020, and despite the previously unanswered question of how the customs plaza would be funded, some work has already begun. U.S., Canadian and Michigan officials reached a formal agreement to build the NITC in 2012. Later that year, the project was briefly jeopardized by a failed, multimillion opposition campaign from billionaire Manuel “Matty” Moroun, who owns the only other bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor. The Ambassador Bridge is one of the rare international crossings that is privately held; the other existing link in the area, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, was built in 1930 and is operated by a company jointly owned by both cities. The Detroit-Windsor corridor is one of North America’s busiest commercial border crossings and is the path for a large portion of U.S.-Canada trade. "
2,POLITICS,Two More Lawsuits Seek To Stamp Out Legal Marijuana In Colorado,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colorado-marijuana-lawsuit_n_6708758.html,,2015-02-19,Vintage distressed retro version of the Colorado State flag with Marijuana leaf in center - controversial issue,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e971220000bb01dd81b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two lawsuits filed in federal court Thursday aim to shut down Colorado's regulated marijuana industry, claiming that the state's recreational marijuana laws are in violation of federal law.The suits, filed by the anti-drug group Safe Streets and three other plaintiffs, target a number of Colorado lawmakers, including Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), Revenue Department Executive Director Barbara Brohl and Marijuana Enforcement Division Director W. Lewis Koski. They allege that by allowing for a regulated marijuana market, these lawmakers are breaking federal law, which considers the plant illegal.But going a step beyond simply suing the state, the plaintiffs -- Phillis Windy Hope Reilly, Michael P. Reilly and New Vision Hotels Two, the corporate owner of a Holiday Inn in the state -- are also going after participants in Colorado's commercial marijuana industry. Citing federal racketeering laws, the plaintiffs are seeking damages due to alleged injury brought on by legalization.The suits name as defendants a number of participants in Colorado's marijuana industry, including various marijuana businesses and their owners, as well as several parties who have provided support for those businesses through banking, insurance and accounting services. The suits even name a construction company, claiming that it agreed to transport water to a marijuana grow.""The Reillys are Colorado property owners who have been injured by a conspiracy to cultivate recreational marijuana near their land,"" one of the suits reads. ""New Vision is... the owner of the Holiday Inn in Frisco, Colorado. It is suffering injuries to its business and property caused by the operations of Summit Marijuana, a state-licensed recreational marijuana store that plans to open less than 75 yards from the front entrance of New Vision’s hotel."" All plaintiffs, according to the suits, are members of Safe Streets, a Washington, D.C.-based group dedicated to combating crime and drugs. The group is led by James Wootton, a former Reagan Department of Justice appointee.The suits argue that under the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause, which states that federal law generally takes precedence over state law, Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional, because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. The plaintiffs are asking federal courts to order Colorado lawmakers to comply with federal law, cease issuing licenses to marijuana businesses and shutter the entire industry in the state.""This lawsuit is a bad idea and represents what is hopefully a last vestige of the wasteful war on drugs,"" Colorado state Rep. Jonathan Singer (D), a vocal supporter of the state's marijuana laws, told The Huffington Post. ""If Safe Streets came to Colorado, they would see that their arguments about economic and moral decay hold no water.""Colorado voters strongly approved Amendment 64, legalizing recreational marijuana in the state, in 2012, and the first retail marijuana shops opened their doors on Jan. 1, 2014. Though the industry has undergone some trial and error since then, a July 2014 report from the Brookings Institution concluded that the rollout of the new marijuana laws has been largely successful thus far. Colorado's marijuana industry has ballooned to a value of around $700 million and the state has taken in about $60 million in taxes and fees, some of which is going toward school construction and renovation.Singer also described to HuffPost a number of signs that marijuana has had little to no negative impact on the state. For example, employment numbers are up -- in fact, the state now has the fourth fastest job growth rate in the country, up from 40th place just five years ago. Meanwhile, crime rates are down in Denver, highway fatalities are at near-historic lows and marijuana use among teens has not grown more widespread under the new laws.There have been some worrying episodes since the new laws went into effect. Two tragic and high-profile fatalities in Denver have been linked to some form of marijuana use. And state hospital officials have reported hearing from a growing number of adults and children who have consumed marijuana products, whose potency can be hard to judge.In response, state lawmakers and the marijuana industry have worked to refine the laws over time. Today, more than a year since sales began, Colorado voters still don't appear to regret ending prohibition of the drug. Colorado state Rep. Jonathan Singer (D) speaks outside of the Marijuana Policy Project's Denver headquarters on Thursday, Feb. 19, with others who support a regulated, legal marijuana industry in the state.""We can't blame the victory or failures in our state solely on marijuana,"" Singer told HuffPost. ""But it is clear that expensive lawsuits are a waste of time.""Carolyn Tyler, communications director for state Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, told HuffPost that the AG office hadn't been formally served with the suit and therefore hadn't had a chance to evaluate the claims the plaintiffs have raised. ""However,"" Tyler said, ""the Colorado Attorney General's Office will defend the state's laws and our clients.""Thursday's suits mark the second time in a matter of months that someone has targeted Colorado's marijuana laws with litigation. In December, the states of Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit against Colorado in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Colorado's marijuana laws are not just unconstitutional but also damaging to the neighboring states because of an alleged increase in marijuana trafficking. Colorado has yet to officially respond to that lawsuit, but former Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said the suit is ""without merit"" and that the attorney general's office will ""vigorously defend"" against it.Wootton announced his support for the states' suit against Colorado in January, saying that President Barack Obama has a ""moral and Constitutional obligation"" to enforce federal laws that prohibit marijuana.Despite the programs currently in place in Colorado and Washington state -- as well as those that will soon go into effect in Oregon and Alaska -- the sale, possession, production and distribution of marijuana all remain illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. The states that have legalized marijuana or softened penalties for possession have only been able to do so because of federal guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations. Kevin Sabet, president of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, applauded the legal action taken by Safe Streets.""We all know the laws in Colorado and Washington and elsewhere violate federal law,"" Sabet told HuffPost Thursday. ""It's nice to see someone has called these laws -- and this industry -- out in the courtroom.""But advocates for marijuana policy reform say this week's lawsuits are misguided. They say they doubt the litigation will be successful in dislodging Colorado's marijuana laws and industry.“Colorado has no obligation to punish adults for using marijuana and every right to take steps to control it,"" said Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project. “It’s hard to imagine why anyone would prefer marijuana be controlled by criminals instead of by tightly regulated businesses.""""If drug cartels relied on litigation instead of violence,"" Tvert added, ""this is the lawsuit they would file."""

Two Americans are dead and one is on trial for murder. I see so much pain and suffering. One of our most decorated soldiers was shot dead by another American soldier. Worse, it happened as he was trying to help another in his time of need.It made me think. I've been reflecting on my old friend Patrick, who like Chris Kyle, was a sniper in the US military. When I met Patrick, it was a time of relative peace, before 9/11 took us to war. At the time, Patrick confided that he had never actually killed anyone. He was committed to his duty and protecting his country, but he shared his honest doubt about what it meant to be a sniper.I recall him saying to me, it's one thing to kill someone in the chaos of combat, self-preservation takes over. In that moment, you're not thinking just reacting. But as a sniper, when you stare into the scope, you see everything about the other person, his clothes, his face, his eyes. It takes the ultimate commitment to size up a person, take a deep breath, pause and pull the trigger. You literally have their life in your hands. You control whether they live or die. It was then that Patrick confided in me. He said he thought he was ready to kill, but until he was actually looking down his rifle, about to kill another person for the first time, he didn't know whether he could. No matter how much training or commitment, in that moment, no one knows how they will react, he said.It wasn't until then that I understood. Once you take a life, there's no going back. You are the one responsible for killing someone. You can tell yourself it was justified, but ultimately, you are the one that pulled the trigger. You take that to your grave. It's a heavy burden. I'm pretty sure Patrick understood that, because he talked in a way that left an impression on me. There was a quietness and seriousness to him. There was no bravado, no ego. Just a resignation to the burden he carried. He knew what it meant to be a sniper. He knew the power he held. It's a level of consciousness and self-reflection that I hope all snipers have. Which brings me to the tragic murder trial of Chris Kyle and his companion Chad Littlefield. Eddie Ray Routh has admitted to killing both men. In court, he pled not guilty by reason of insanity. The legal definition of insanity is the inability to tell the difference between fantasy and reality or more to the point, an inability to distinguish right from wrong.The prosecutor will claim Mr. Routh murdered both men. The legal definition of murder requires an act of premeditation. To be guilty, Eddie Ray Routh must have had a moment of pause. He had to consciously reflect on his decision to shoot and know the consequences of killing Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. He had to know shooting them was wrong.The idea of premeditation is very similar to the moment of doubt my friend Patrick was talking about, a deep moment of reflection. It is time to think about what you are doing. It's a moment of clarity, a moment of Zen. Is it right or wrong for me to pull this trigger? What are the consequences if I shoot? We ask our military men and women to weigh that question every day. They defend our country and our freedoms. They volunteer to protect everyone of us and each other. In doing so, they are prepared to die for us. They are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. Yet we still ask for more. We ask them to make the ultimate moral sacrifice too. We ask them to kill for us. Yes, it's in protection of our country and our freedoms, but it's killing nonetheless.Which is why I hope we will all take a moment to reflect on this horrible tragedy. I hope we will pause to meditate on the heavy burden we are placing on every soldier. As my friend Patrick said, until you are asked to kill another person, you do not know how you will react. You can't know what it will do to you. Put in his circumstances, everyone one of us might be an Eddie Ray Routh. Someone confused and lost, because the rules of war are very different than the rules of peace. Is it so hard to feel compassion for what that might do to a person? Wouldn't the contradictions be enough to drive anyone insane?I do not know the circumstances of Eddie Ray Routh's combat tour, but whatever happened, he experienced real psychological damage. By all accounts he was suffering horribly as a result of his experience as a soldier. I believe we as Americans are responsible for his well-being. So, during his trial I hope we will not rush to judgement. I hope we will look to forgive and heal before we look to punish and put away.It is not my place to decide guilt or innocence. A jury will decide the consequences of his actions. As I watch, my thoughts and deepest sympathies will be with the families of both Chris Kyle and Eddie Ray Routh. Understanding the burden our soldiers carry for us means taking a moment to think about the sacrifices they and their families make. Sacrifices which are leading to enormous pain and anguish.Ultimately, the question is not whether Eddie Ray Routh premeditated before pulling the trigger, the bigger question is whether we as a nation are premeditating on the consequences for our soldiers and their families. If we lose sight of what they are going through, we lose sight of who we are. Without premeditation, without thought, the person on the other end of the gun, or the accused on trial, becomes just an object, a casualty, a statistic. Records and awards are not why we are fighting. Our measure of success should not be in how many we kill, but how much time we take before killing, because every bullet and every soldier is worth thinking about. With every decision to pull the trigger, someone's life hangs in the balance. We are fighting to protect lives and principals of individual liberty. Principals which ask us to take a moment to reflect. To think about compassion before confrontation, benevolence before belligerence, life before death.So, in our hyper connected world where we never have enough time to think. I hope we will all take a moment to think about, Chris Kyle, Eddie Ray Routh, Chad Littlefield and all the other men and women who serve to protect our freedoms. Every one of them carries the burden of life and death on our behalf. We owe it them to take a moment, acknowledge their sacrifice, and wish them well. If not, we are the one's that will suffer the consequences."

Brown/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae06da200000e800ff2fcf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, we were invited to preview a new documentary about the life of Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning playwright August Wilson -- August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand, produced by the award-winning filmmaker Sam Pollard.The documentary will debut on PBS stations nationally this week. This film is a beautiful legacy. It sheds light on a very gifted man who, like many creative people, was raised under difficult circumstances in an underserved area of Pittsburgh. All of his plays were ""doors"" into the black experience, and from many eras of the American story. In the film, several award-winning actors, who loved the man and the plays he created, shared his life through first-hand stories.The documentary really touched me as I've been influenced by theater and the arts my entire life. A friend of my mom was the personal assistant to Mary Martin, the great ""grand dame"" of musicals. Each time Ms. Martin performed in Los Angeles, we were there. A highlight of the experience for a skinny eight-year-old, was the opportunity to visit her dressing room and see the mysteries of the stage first-hand. It was all so very exciting.My father, Rex Stewart, was a jazz musician with Duke Ellington for over 15 years, and thus introduced my siblings and I to the world of entertainment at a very early age. Being raised in the 50s, it was really clear that seeing a play written by a black playwright was pretty rare, let alone attending a black theater, especially in Los Angeles where I grew up. New York City had a more robust black theater scene and better-established outlets for creative black people.The Ebony Showcase Theater in Los Angeles was one of the few locally owned and operated black theaters in Los Angeles when it opened its doors in the '50s. Nick and Edna Stewart (Nick played ""Lightening"" in Amos 'n Andy), were determined to bring theater to the black community, and they wanted to make available a place where up-and-coming black actors and playwrights could practice their craft. Since the Stewarts were friends of my family, it was quite natural for me to visit the theater to see some of their shows and watch the whole practice of stagecraft. To be honest, it wasn't until much later that I became aware of the importance of this theater and how many black playwrights and actors walked the boards there. I knew of the most famous plays written by black Americans, Raisin in the Sun, For Colored Girls, The Dutchman etc., were performed in this theater, but the theater was also the training ground for many who later became very well known -- John Amos and Isabel Stanford were examples.February is Black History Month, and it is usually celebrated by the media and others by trotting out some of the older, well-known black heroes. I hold nothing against this practice, but to me, it's the ""easy way out."" Just dust off George Washington Carver and Martin Luther King (both great role models), and not take the time to delve into black history or culture to find other important icons. A playwright like August Wilson is someone to be publicly honored on a grand scale. His concepts, words and content, are clear insights into the ups and downs of the black experience. All of his plays received acclaim and nods from the beat critics and the general public. The new documentary is an excellent opportunity for my grandchildren to understand where we came from and what our proud place is as black people in America. August Wilson's plays have done just that and captured the speech, culture, rhythm and heart of the black experience as seen through his eyes. This documentary catalogs such an important legacy, and I applaud those responsible for perceiving more than the obvious and supporting the production of August Wilson's life. PBS stations like WQED, WYCC, WNET and corporate entities like PNC Bank have moved forward together to tell a story that needs to be told.Attending the theater continues to be important to me, and I hope to instill it in my grandchildren. Currently, I am a proud subscriber and supporter of the Lyric Opera, Chicago Shakespeare, the Goodman Theater, Steppenwolf Theater and Congo Square. However, what has become exciting is the increase in the number of black theaters, playwrights and actors on the stage. August Wilson died in 2005, but giants like him made this happen, and there are more creative black heroes out there who need to be seen and heard. Let's hope this film inspires more to do the same.

Now that Jon Stewart of The Daily Show is planning to leave, there is much speculation as to who will take his place. For my money, John Fugelsang stands out as the best choice. Admittedly, there are more than a few worthy choices but Fulgelsang should be the one. If the top execs that run Comedy Central want Stewart's replacement to parallel the key strengths of Jon Stewart, then Fugelsang is their guy. Both of these politically oriented comedians are highly intelligent, super quick-witted and extremely knowledgeable about politics. They also could very well be the ""two fastest guns"" when it comes to speaking truth to power. Stephen Colbert, also is in the discussion, but he has his new replacement gig to worry about. Stewart and Fugelsang have an enormous capacity to brilliantly rebut political questions that get put on the table at a moments notice. Fugelsang is particularly good at forging on the spot zinger quality comebacks to right wing spins on political matters. A caller on The Stephanie Miller Show had a great suggestion of creating an app with Fugelsang comebacks, to be used on friends and family, if one of them trots out some lame right wing talking point.Fugelsang, is a weekly guest on Stephanie's TV/radio show and is part of Stephanie's very popular Sexy Liberal Comedy Show. Stephanie, is also a very legitimate candidate to replace Stewart. However, the big shots that run Comedy Central probably want to plug and play someone into this role that is similar to Jon. TV audiences that like a particular format have established clear-cut expectations of what they like. With this in mind, they want their expectations to be mirrored as closely as possible in the form of the new host replacing the old host. John Fugelsang is the best choice to keep the engine purring and the ratings high. Ideally, Fugelsang gets the job. Once he establishes enough leverage with Comedy Central he may be able to bring Stephanie's hilarious brand of political humor to their network. That would truly be a win,win for Comedy Central and their audience.Another quality asset, both Fugelsang and Stewart share is a really big heart with a strong moral compass. This is not to say that other candidates do not have this but when you get behind the biting humor it's easy to trust and connect to both Jon and John. Jon Stewart could very well be the most trusted person commenting on politics today. However, Fugelsang could easily make the grade as well. These two, somewhat uniquely, combine super quick wits, incisive well articulated intelligence, high morality, big hearts all with big laughs. Jon Stewart has been a treasure as a very funny yet powerful voice in the ugly world of politics. Humor is the vital secret sauce of political comedy that makes the bitter medicine of being politically informed so much easier to swallow. Jon Stewart is probably the top gunslinger in shooting the truth at power. John Fugelsang is my guy to become the new sheriff in the world of political comedy."

A total of 39 charter schools applied.Nearly 80 people spoke at the five-hour meeting, which was at times flanked by dozens of police officers. The crowd frequently shouted down speakers who were encouraged to keep talking despite the interruptions to save time. Four people were arrested for disorderly conduct.""I don't see where this ends. I see this as continuing to chip away at the foundation of our school system,"" said Bob Previdi, a parent who sends two children to a prestigious district magnet school.The district already has 86 charter institutions, public schools that operate independently and offer an alternative to schools run by the local school district. Proponents say charters can help get students out of low-performing schools.""Expand what works and change the trajectory of lives in this city,"" said Aaron Bass, who advocated for the new schools.The American Federation of Teachers has fought against the nation's expansion of mostly non-unionized charter schools, including in Philadelphia, arguing that some of the schools fail and that they lack accountability and transparency. RAPID RISE IN ENROLLMENTDespite the lack of new charter licenses in years, the schools have grown rapidly in Pennsylvania as the district has turned over some under-performing schools to charter operators and existing charters have expanded.Charter school enrollment has doubled since 2007, when the they served 32,000 students. They now educate 30 percent of the Philadelphia system's 207,000 students, according to district figures.They also account for about a third, or $766.7 million, of the district's $2.5 billion budget, which is an uptick from 2011, when charters took up just 18 percent, according to district budget documents.Opponents warn that approving new charter seats could deny resources to existing public schools. When students transfer into charters, they essentially take their funding with them but leave the traditional schools stuck with the fixed costs like building maintenance and central administration.Charters receive about $10,000 a year for each student they enroll, the same as the district spends on students in other schools. But according to an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, each charter seat costs the district on average about $7,000 in costs it cannot shed.Unlike most school boards, the commission does not have taxing authority and must rely on appropriations from the state and city to cover shortfalls in property tax receipts.Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat who beat incumbent Republican Governor Tom Corbett in November in part because some voters said Corbett had underfunded the state's public schools, opposed the vote.""The Wolf Administration continues to believe that the district's financial situation cannot responsibly handle the approval of new charter schools,"" Wolf's office said in a statement following the vote.

9,RELIGION,Snow Won't Stop These New England Churches From Soldiering On,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snow-church-new-england_n_6710130.html,,2015-02-19,"Workers clear snow from a roof in Boston, Monday, Feb. 16, 2015. New England remained bitterly cold Monday after the region's fourth winter storm in a month blew through. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fb62200000c101018ac6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) If God brought all this snow, he also made it very hard to get to church.New Englanders, clobbered by four major storms in the past month and bracing for a fifth, are finding it difficult to travel anywhere, including to services on Sundays.And the Rev. Andrew Cryans of Durham, N.H. — where more than 45 inches of snow fell in the past week alone — can’t help but notice that most of these meteorological whoppers have arrived on weekends, so that churchgoers might have a harder time getting to church than, say, school or work.But the liturgy goes on, no matter how many show up, or how creative a pastor may have to get to connect with the flock. That can mean a priest snowshoes to work, or delivers a sermon via Facebook.“I always tell parishioners that I live in the house behind the church, so it’s easy for me,” said Cryans, of St. Thomas More Catholic Church. “I’m here if you come and we will have Mass no matter how few of you there are.”For St. Thomas More, that amounted to 28 people on Sunday morning (Feb. 15), during a snowstorm. On a typical Sunday, the church expects at least 350.In Hingham, Mass., where the National Guard has been brought in to help the seaside town dig out from more than 8 feet of snow, the Rev. Peter Allen didn’t want to cancel services at Hingham Congregational Church. “We really count on having face-to-face time on Sunday mornings,” he said. “But I’ve never witnessed anything like this.”So he let parishioners know that church would be open for anyone who felt it safe to make the journey.“I told the church that I would snowshoe over and unlock the church and I’d be there to share a spiritual conversation and prayer — and one family did come,” Allen said.For those who couldn’t make it, Allen posted an online video about Lent.“It’s not as good as being there in person, but they know that church will continue,” he said, adding that more than 125 people braved the cold to bag 17,000 servings of food for the homeless in the church’s social hall the previous weekend.“People felt a sense of obligation to make their way in the snow to get there,” he said. “Whatever frustration we’ve been having with the weather pales in comparison to a family trying to feed itself,” he said, noticing that it was once again snowing outside his window.Though recent snowfall in the South doesn’t rival the relentless storms that have buffeted New England, Southerners unaccustomed to the cold and icy roads have also had their decisions to make about whether to brave the weather for church.Many pastors have advised their parishioners to stay home, or find a church closer to home until conditions improve.As the Rev. Thomas McKenzie of the Anglican Church of the Redeemer in Nashville told The Tennessean newspaper: “Jesus knows your heart — you don’t have to risk your life.”Before the most recent Sunday snow hit, the Rev. Alex Dyer of the Episcopal Church of St. Paul and St. James in New Haven, Conn., followed the forecast like a school superintendent trying to decide whether it’s going to be a snow day. Given the dire predictions, he decided — as he had before a particularly awful storm two years ago — to move the Sunday service to Facebook.“I got on my clerical collar and sat in front of the computer” and taped a video in front of no one, said Dyer. “It’s a little weird and a little awkward, but part of ministry is getting out of your comfort zone.”Dyer posted his video sermon, about the Transfiguration of Jesus and taking time to slow down in life, to the church’s Facebook page. He put the rest of the service on Facebook, too, every part in a separate post — from the opening hymn (a YouTube video of “Alleluia, Sing to Jesus”) to a reading from the Gospels to the announcements. There was even a virtual collection plate, a link that led to the church’s online donation page.Dyer isn’t sure how many people went to St. Paul and St. James through their computers, tablets or phones on Sunday morning, but he had about 15 people email him later about the service, and others who commented “Amen” on the page. One man — not a member of the congregation — called to thank Dyer for the service from Florida, where there was no snow but a wife suffering from cancer who could not make it to church.A Facebook service can never replace a real service, but it’s a useful tool, Dyer said. “The purpose of social media is to gather and connect people, and the purpose of the church is to gather God’s people together.”Is that the purpose of all this challenging weather? To show people how much they miss church? Cryans, for one, is not exactly sure why God sent so much snow this winter.“Maybe the people who like to ski are praying a little harder than the rest of us,” he said."

Women see Hillary as representing the future rather than the past. And uncertainty and misconceptions about Common Core standards are widespread. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, February 19, 2015.WHO WOULD YOU CONSIDER IN 2016? - Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Anthony Salvanto, and Fred Backus: ""With less than a year to go before the first contests of the 2016 presidential election are underway, the latest CBS News Poll asked Americans which candidates they would consider supporting for their party's nomination. Among the potentially crowded Republican field, self-identified Republicans are most likely to say they would consider voting for Jeb Bush (49 percent) and Mike Huckabee (46 percent) for the GOP nomination. These political figures also appear to be the best known of the potential candidates....At this point, there is little enthusiasm for Chris Christie. Forty-three percent of Republicans would not consider supporting Christie for the Republican nomination for President - the highest of any Republican figure asked about, while 28 percent would consider backing him...Republicans nationwide are divided on Rand Paul at this early stage: 30 percent of Republicans would support him, but 31 percent would not."" [CBS]And among Democrats - More from CBS: ""Democrats are most likely to say they would consider supporting Hillary Clinton for their party's nomination: 81 percent would consider voting for [Clinton]; only 12 percent would not. Vice President Joe Biden follows Clinton; 47 percent of Democrats would consider backing him for the Democratic nomination, although 35 percent would not vote for him. A third of Democrats would back Elizabeth Warren, and only 14 percent would not consider her for the party's nomination. Still, Warren remains unfamiliar to 53 percent of Democrats nationwide."" WHO REPRESENTS THE FUTURE? - Jennifer Agiesta: ""Who among the nascent field of 2016 contenders represents the future? For half of Americans, it's Hillary Clinton. Asked in a new CNN/ORC poll whether seven possible candidates better represent the future or the past, 50% said Clinton evoked the future, more than said so of any other candidate. By contrast, Joe Biden and Jeb Bush, whose names have been in the political conversation even longer than Clinton's, were each seen as representing the past by 64% of Americans....Overall, across the field of seven, just two were deemed more ""future"" than ""past,"" and both were women: Clinton (50% future, 48% past) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (46% future, 37% past)....Both Clinton and Warren prompt significant gender gaps, with women more likely than men to call each a representation of the future. Among men, 53% see Clinton as a representation of the past, while 55% of women see her representing the future. On Warren, women see her as more future than past by a 50% to 32% margin, while men split evenly, 43% on each side."" [CNN]SWING STATE VOTERS WANT THE NEXT PRESIDENT TO CHANGE DIRECTION- Quinnipiac: ""Voters in three critical swing states, Colorado, Iowa and Virginia, disapprove by margins of 9 percentage points of the job President Barack Obama is doing…By even bigger margins, voters want the next president to change directions from President Obama's policies...Voters support by wide margins, Obama's proposal to increase taxes on higher income earners to reduce taxes on the middle class. By smaller margins, voters in each state oppose the president's proposal to provide free community college tuition….'[W]hile voters in all three states say their state economy is excellent or good, and many say their personal financial situation is improving, more think Obama's policies have hurt rather than helped the economy'... 'There is strong agreement - by more than 2-1 in these states - on the need to ban from public schools children who have not been vaccinated against childhood diseases such as measles.'"" [Quinnipiac]ONLY 17 PERCENT OF AMERICANS FAVOR COMMON CORE STANDARDS - Dan Cassino: ""Currently, 40 percent of Americans say they disapprove of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), often referred to as just the 'Common Core,' with 42 percent who are unsure and 17 percent who favor the standards... Interestingly, a much greater proportion of Americans – 40 percent – say that they approve of attempts by the federal government to establish educational standards than approve of the Common Core... A majority of Democrats (55%) say that they approve of federal attempts to establish standards, along with only 25 percent of Republicans but only 27 percent of Democrats and 9 percent of Republicans say that they approve of the Common Core…The same survey finds that most Americans say that they don’t know very much about the Common Core standards, and they seem to be right: misconceptions about the content of the standards are widespread – almost half of Americans (44%) think that sex education are part of them – and are strongly connected with opposition to them.""

The accidental fatal shooting of a US woman by her own two-year-old son at a Walmart store has left her family devastated and again raised questions about gun safety in America. Veronica Rutledge was out shopping with her son and three nieces on December 30, 2014 in Hayden, Idaho when the child unzipped her handbag -- specially designed to carry a concealed weapon -- and the gun went off. The 29-year-old nuclear research scientist, who held a concealed-carry permit, got the bag last week as a Christmas gift from her husband Colt Rutledge, with whom she shared a passion for guns. 'An inquisitive two-year-old boy reached into the purse, unzipped the compartment, found the gun and shot his mother in the head,' her father-in-law Terry Rutledge told the Washington Post newspaper. AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31bd83c000066000c4a6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In a move that could alter the minimum wage debate and improve the image of the world's largest retailer, Walmart announced it will raise the baseline wage of its current store employees to $10 per hour, bringing pay hikes to an estimated 500,000 workers.The company said in an announcement on Thursday that it would raise its wage floor to $9 in April, followed by a second boost to $10 by next February. The decision follows similar moves by other major retailers such as Gap and IKEA, but the sheer size of Walmart sets the company apart. The Arkansas-based retailer is the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., with an estimated 1.4 million employees, and it is largely seen as a trend-setter in the retail industry.On a quarterly earnings call aligned with the announcement, Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, said raising wages would be good for both employees and customers.""Overall, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores,"" McMillon said. ""As a result, we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience, which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time.""Right now we want to make sure everybody is crystal clear [on] how vital our store experience is for our future,"" McMillon added in a later CNBC interview. ""Customers need to be served, and associates need to be happy and love their job.""According to a Walmart spokesman, the new wage floors will apply to current employees. New hires next year will be earning at least $9, but will be bumped up to at least $10 per hour after roughly six months of training.In the CNBC interview, McMillon suggested that the improving U.S. economy -- with unemployment falling recently to 5.7 percent from a peak of 10 percent after the recession -- was also pressuring Walmart to raise wages.""It's great to see the job market getting better, and the market works, so we're adjusting to that market,"" he said.Walmart has long been saddled with a reputation as a low-wage employer, and its battles with labor unions -- in particular the United Food and Commercial Workers union -- stretch back decades. In recent years, labor groups have organized high-profile worker strikes to coincide with the company's Black Friday shopping events, pillorying the retailer over its pay practices.The across-the-board pay hikes should help rehabilitate that image. They will probably also help Walmart improve customer service in its stores. Over the past two years, bare shelves in Walmart supercenters have become a common sight. A report from a research firm last year traced the troubles in part to a lack of investment in the company's labor.""We know that this wouldn't have happen[ed] without our work to stand together with hundreds of thousands of supporters to change the country's largest employer,” Emily Wells, an OUR Walmart member, said in a statement Thursday from the group. Wells said she's currently earning $9.50 per hour and will now see a raise, though she added that workers still face erratic scheduling.A $10 wage would still leave many workers and their families below the poverty line, but it's well above the $7.25 federal minimum wage that still prevails in states without a higher one.The fact that Walmart is raising its base wage could help lawmakers in Congress in their push to raise the federal wage floor, which hasn't been raised since 2009. Democrats have proposed hiking it to $10.10 per hour and tying it to an inflation index, but Republicans in both chambers have blocked the measure from moving forward.The proposal is extremely popular among Americans in general, polling with broad approval that crosses party lines. The decision by Walmart could make Republicans look even more out-of-touch.""It is encouraging that the nation’s largest employer, Walmart, has recognized what Republicans in Congress fail to acknowledge: that $7.25 is significantly too low an hourly wage for any American worker,"" said Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). ""We hope that this move will help convince Republicans to stop blocking efforts to raise the wage.""With Congress gridlocked, many states have moved ahead with raises to their own minimum wages, with a slate of ballot measures passing in the November elections. For the first time ever, a majority of states now have a higher minimum wage than the federal level.HuffPost readers: Did you receive a raise due to the recent minimum wage hikes on Jan. 1?

He'd run out of food, water, and time. What he did have was a utility knife. You can imagine the rest (or you can see it graphically rendered in the movie 127 Hours).Ukraine is not a wild animal or an unlucky hiker. It's not located in a remote part of the world. Indeed, its central location has contributed to its misfortune. Ukraine is trapped by its geography, caught between a suspicious East and an opportunistic West.And, like Aron Ralston, it is running out of time and options.The last year has been a cruel one for Ukraine. The street protests that successfully ousted the country's corrupt leader one year ago set off a chain reaction that led to a confrontation with Russia, a terrible civil war, and the loss of more than 5,000 lives. Last week, negotiators hammered out a truce of sorts, and on Sunday a very uneasy ceasefire settled over much of the rebellious eastern part of the country. Whether this ceasefire or some future one proves durable, Ukraine must eventually make some very difficult decisions concerning its future.Above all, it must figure out a way of exiting the steel trap that has clamped down on its nether regions. The Crimean peninsula has already been sliced off. Should Ukraine sever another one of its own limbs in order to survive?A Violent CeasefireNegotiators sat down in the Belarusian capital of Minsk last week to stop the war in Ukraine. They were under a lot of pressure. The EU had readied another series of sanctions against Russia. More critically, the United States was on the verge of sending lethal aid to the Ukrainian government, a move that European leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel resolutely opposed.After 16 hours of coffee and Belarusian dairy products, the negotiators hammered out a compromise. This ceasefire was supposed to go into effect last Sunday. But virtually none of the terms has been honored.For one thing, fighting never stopped. The conflict continued to rage around the disputed town of Debaltseve, which Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted should surrender to the rebels before backing down after Merkel threatened to walk out of the Minsk deliberations. The rebels, however, decided to change the facts on the ground by continuing to fight over the key transportation hub and forcing a Ukrainian army retreat. Other areas have also reported continued fighting.Heavy weapons, meanwhile, were to be withdrawn two days after the ceasefire went into effect, but that didn't happen either. There was also disagreement over the treatment of the top rebel leaders, with the government in Kiev arguing that the amnesty in the agreement didn't apply to rebel leaders who engaged in ""crimes against humanity.""Russia, meanwhile, never admitted to being party to the conflict. The agreement doesn't address Crimea. And the status of the breakaway regions in the east remained in that hazy grey area between autonomy and independence.Negotiators speak of the ""ripeness"" of a conflict for mediation. Talk about euphemisms. What they really mean is that the combatants have pummeled themselves so thoroughly, the tide of blood has risen so high, and the contested territory has shrunk in size so embarrassingly that a ceasefire becomes the only viable alternative to eternal stalemate.The Korean War lasted for three years, but it was only the first year that witnessed a huge swing in military fortunes. The last two years were meat-grinding battles over the same narrow patch of ground. Only when both sides gave up on the illusion of repeating their earlier successful surges across the length of the peninsula did an armistice become possible.In Ukraine, the rebels still believe that they can secure more territory for their self-proclaimed republics. And the government in Kiev still believes it can suppress the rebellion to the degree necessary to preserve the territorial integrity of the country. Recent history -- East Timor, Kosovo, South Sudan -- would seem to favor the rebels. Like Serbia, Ukraine faces the prospect of leaving behind a portion of its former self in order to escape the trap of war.But the experience of Ukraine's neighbors offers another scenario that is not quite independence and not quite territorial integrity. Call it the ""ghost limb"" option.The Region of Ghost LimbsThe collapse of the Soviet Union generated a string of conflicts along the periphery of Russia and even inside Russia itself. These were not, for the most part, ideological battles. They concerned ethnicity and the control of territory. Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The civil war in Tajikistan pitted Garmis and Parmiris against Kulyabis. Chechens took on Moscow in an effort to create an independent Chechnya.But the battles that more accurately prefigured the civil war in Ukraine took place in Georgia and Moldova. These two countries have had their own civil wars, their own contested relationship with Russia, and their own breakaway regions. Today, both Georgia and Moldova are peaceful. But that peace has come at a price.For Georgia, civil war came even before the Soviet Union officially collapsed.Under the leadership of uber-nationalist Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the Georgian government turned on the enclave of South Ossetia, which had the temerity to protest the abolition of its autonomy in late 1990.South Ossetia, Gamsakhurdia argued, ""should be chopped up, they should be burned out with a red-hot iron from the Georgian nation, these traitors and venal people."" In 1991, the Georgian military attacked South Ossetia. A truce eventually ended the fighting in 1992. But Mikheil Saakashvili, who took over as Georgia's president in 2004, revived Gamsakhurdia's approach and attempted to solve the problem militarily, once again unsuccessfully.The situation in Georgia is further complicated by the status of Abkhazia, which also enjoyed a measure of autonomy during the Soviet era. A month after the Georgians and the South Ossetians signed a ceasefire brokered by Russia, Abkhazia declared independence. After a year of fighting, Georgia and Abkhazia signed a ceasefire agreement, again brokered by Russia. But this one fell apart, and the war continued.In 2008, Georgia and Russia came to blows in what has been called the first European war of the 21st century. The fighting lasted less than a week, and Russia overpowered its weaker neighbor. Moscow acted in large part to prevent Georgia from joining NATO, though its actions will likely prove only temporarily effective.Immediately after this short war, Russia recognized the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Not many other countries followed suit -- three, to be precise: Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Nauru. Not surprisingly, South Ossetia and Abkhazia also recognize each other. Since both countries border Russia, the Georgian government fears that because independence has not proven internationally viable, the two enclaves will opt instead for annexation to Russia.At least South Ossetia and Abkhazia have four international supporters. Transnistria, the breakaway section of Moldova, remains entirely unrecognized. Nor does it border Russia, its patron. The narrow strip of land lies along the southwestern edge of Ukraine. It too endured a war -- between 1992 and 1993 -- and a plurality of the inhabitants speaks Russian. In a 2006 referendum, 97 percent of the population of Transnistria favored joining the Russian federation. Approximately 1,200 Russian troops are stationed in Transnistria.Both Moldova and Georgia maintain their claims over these regions. But they are not fully functioning limbs, for they cannot be controlled from Tbilisi or Chisinau. They are, in other words, ghost limbs. The Georgians and Moldovans still believe in the existence of these limbs. But when they look down, all they see is a border of stitches where the amputation took place.Ukraine Cuts Its Losses?The government in Kiev could rightly challenge these analogies. It did not pledge to extirpate the ethnic Russians of eastern Ukraine, as Gamsakhurdia did to the South Ossetians. It did not force a language reform on Russian speakers, as the Moldovans did on Transnistria.What Ukraine did do, however, was entertain the possibility of shifting westward: joining the EU and even, eventually, NATO.This became the nightmare scenario for Russia and far outweighed Putin's disparagement of the leaders in Kiev as ""fascists"" and ""putschists."" After all, the war with Georgia was effectively Russia's signal to NATO of its line in the sand. Ukraine threatened to go over the line. Although its concerns about NATO encroachment are understandable, Russia's response -- to provide firepower for a handful of separatists and Russian mercenaries -- was unacceptable.Ukraine might have gotten its hopes up when Congress started pushing the issue of sending lethal aid. But that's as far as Washington will go, and it might not go even that far, given the Obama administration's ambivalence. If Russia were to intervene in a NATO member state such as Lithuania or Latvia, it would be a different story, given NATO collective security guarantees. But Putin has already written off the Baltics. It's the wavering states he wants to control at a distance.Stephen Walt recently argued in Foreign Policy against arming Kiev by claiming that the ""deterrence model"" didn't apply to Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader, in other words, is ""not greedy, seeking some sort of personal glory, or ideologically driven to expand."" Rather, his aggressive policy is ""motivated primarily by fear or insecurity."" As such, Russia won't be deterred by a reciprocal aggressive action, which will only increase its feelings of insecurity and create a spiral of escalation.I agree with Walt that adding arms to the conflict will only lead to more escalation and push the ""ripeness"" for mediation further into the future. At the same time, however, I suspect that Putin is not acting purely out of insecurity. He doesn't harbor an ambition to resurrect the Soviet Union. But he does aspire to create a more powerful sphere of influence around Russian borders. That aspiration doesn't require annexation. Transnistria is not likely to become part of Russia anytime soon. But it does complicate Moldova's aspirations to join the West.For Ukraine, this may well mean that it will have to tolerate a level of ambiguity in its eastern realms that most other countries would not accept. The statelets of Donetsk and Luhansk are no more viable than South Ossetia or Transnistria. But war didn't suppress those earlier independence struggles. It took Georgia and Moldova some time before they were willing to accept amputation.If Ukraine wants to move on with its aspirations to move closer to the West, it will probably have to submit to the knife as well. Who knows? After many years of international isolation, lukewarm Russian support, and economic stagnation, the ghost limbs might themselves appeal for reattachment.This is not fair, of course. Russia has been playing a dirty game. But no one ever said that geopolitics is fair. The situation that befell Aron Ralston wasn't fair either. But sometimes you have to do what's necessary to survive, even if it means cutting away what you hold dear.This post is crossposted from Foreign Policy in Focus."

(AP Photo/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e90912200008300da154a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seven patients are infected and almost 200 others were exposed to a potentially fatal group of ""superbugs"" carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The bug may have played a role in the deaths of two patients. UCLA said in a statement Wednesday that the exposure may have occurred during endoscopic procedures.Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is a class of germs that is highly resistant to treatment with antibiotics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some Enterobacteriaceae are actually a normal part of human gut bacteria, like Klebsiella and E. coli, but experts say the overuse and misuse of antibiotics has been causing some bacteria to become resistant to modern medicine.Infections with CRE are very difficult to treat and can be deadly. Because CRE is a group of germs, different kinds lead to different illnesses, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections, according to the CDC.However, healthy people don't usually contract CRE infections, according to the CDC, since ""superbugs"" typically affect patients in health care settings, who are usually being treated for a different condition. People with compromised immune systems may have an increased risk.For a person to be infected, CRE germs must enter the body, typically through contact with an infected person's wounds or feces. However, as is suspected in the UCLA exposure, the bacteria can also be passed via medical devices that enter the body. The same type of medical device has been implicated in other CRE exposures, according to UCLA. The hospital says it is now ""utilizing a decontamination process that goes above and beyond manufacturer and national standards."" Some people exposed to CRE will not become infected and are said to be colonized with CRE. They won't need treatment. Certain antibiotics may offer relief for those infected with drug-resistant bacteria, but further research is still needed to identify the most effective treatment measures.Alarmingly, hospital CRE exposures are far from unheard of. In fact, reports suggest ""superbug"" infections are on the rise, although still highly uncommon. As of February 2014, the CDC had confirmed CRE cases in all but three states. About 4 percent of U.S. hospitals saw at least one CRE infection in the first half of 2012, The Associated Press reported. And researchers reported that from 2008 to 2012, the amount of CRE detected in community hospitals in the southeastern part of the country increased fivefold.""We're trying to sound the alarm. This is a problem for all of us in health care,"" Deverick J. Anderson, senior author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Duke, told USA Today. ""These [bacteria] are just about as bad as it gets.""Currently, the best measures to take are preventive. Hospitals and patients alike should practice careful hand-washing and disinfecting of hospital rooms and medical equipment, and staff may consider keeping patients with CRE infections from sharing rooms with others. The CDC also urges patients and medical professionals to avoid unnecessary prescriptions and use of antibiotics."

Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt urged Danish Jews not to emigrate despite a call from her Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu for European Jews to move to Israel following the Copenhagen attacks. AFP PHOTO/GALI TIBBON (Photo credit should read GALI TIBBON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fb5b2100002501c91dfb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Having made an annual gift to Israel (usually through my local Jewish federation) without a break for 41 years, I have always supported the Zionist vision of a democratic, pluralistic state that -- while majority Jewish -- would always treat every citizen equally. Freedom of religion and open cultural expression for all are essential parts of that vision. That Zionist vision rallied most Jews in the early days of the State of Israel as it struggled for its very existence amidst avowed enemies. All of those who cared about Israel in those days supported its government because Israel was fragile and endangered.In the 67 years of Israel's existence, it has gone from a struggling and impoverished country to a technological juggernaut with an economy stronger than those of several European countries. And it has developed a remarkably formidable military for a country of its size. That does not have to conflict with the Zionist vision of my youth. But that vision will only be fulfilled when there is fully equal treatment for Israel's Arab citizens, a system of social welfare and education that provides for all Israelis, and a peace agreement that creates a Palestinian state so that Palestinians can shape their own destiny and Israel can cease to be an occupying power.What does conflict with the early Zionist vision is an Israeli government that continues to build in the West Bank and deprives Palestinians of control over their land. The expenditures to expand the settlements in the West Bank not only are unjust to Palestinians; they warp the Israeli budget and psyche in a way antithetical to the original Zionist vision that many of us still support.That is the context in which we should understand the actions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which have led me to write my first fully public statement criticizing a sitting Israeli government official. This statement comes after careful consideration because I am heartbroken about the current state of affairs. Like an increasing number of American Jews, I want to make it clear that Netanyahu does not speak for me.The Netanyahu government includes political parties committed to retaining possession of the West Bank in perpetuity. Netanyahu himself has thrown up roadblocks to successful negotiation. Unwilling for political reasons to publicly acknowledge that he will not enter into an equitable land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, he has damaged Israel's reputation in the world and significantly undermined the democratic, pluralistic vision of Zionism and the moral core of Israeli life.Netanyahu's decision to accept Republican leaders' invitation to address Congress has dealt a major blow to the long-time United States-Israel alliance, in which partisan politics have until now been kept at bay. Netanyahu's upcoming speech demonstrates that Netanyahu is siding with conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians who support his vision of a greater Israel rather than land-for-peace. Taking the Republican side is an attack on President Obama and the Democratic Party. Netanyahu's official reason is that he wants to speak out on Iran. The irony is that in taking this route, he has disrupted a carefully shaped campaign by American Jewish leaders and others committed to containing Iran's nuclear ambitions that would have probably resulted in sanctions being passed by Congress had he not thrown this monkey wrench into the works.A second motive for his scheduled appearance is to bolster his chances to remain Prime Minister in the upcoming Israeli elections. His appearance will take place shortly before the election. His decision to pursue the Congressional invitation comes at the cost of a serious rupture with the leaders of the American Jewish community, who privately overwhelmingly object to Netanyahu's decision. They were shocked not to have been consulted before Netanyahu made his announcement.Netanyahu has stated that in coming to speak to Congress, he represents the voice of world Jewry. At best, that claim is a delusion, and at worse, a self-serving lie. There has never been any one person able to speak for world Jewry, an ideologically, theologically, and culturally diverse group of communities. He surely does not speak for me, nor for thousands of active, Jews committed to Israel.With Israel still endangered by enemies, including Hamas, the Islamic State, Hezbollah and Iran, those who care about its future must continue to speak out and offer it political and moral support. At the same time, we need to be frank about the dangers to the Zionist dream that arise from within Israel. These include: those who want to continue expanding settlements in the West Bank, those who want the Chief Rabbinate to control of Jewish status in Israel, and those who undermine efforts at a successful peace agreement between Israel and a Palestinian state.Whereas in the 1950s and '60s supporting Israel entailed supporting successive governments and staying united behind them, now supporting a democratic, pluralist and just vision for Israel means speaking out against Netanyahu and his allies, who are undermining the foundations of a land I love."
