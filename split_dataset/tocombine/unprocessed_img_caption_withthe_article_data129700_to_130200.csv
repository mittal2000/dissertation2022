0,WEDDINGS,Why You Should Treat Your Husband Like Your Boyfriend,"Jenny G. Perry, Contributor

We don't believe in having a perfect life, but rather perfect moments. We're not a sitcom.",2014-02-05,2014-02-05-404513_10151990825968009_1675559805_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-05-404513_10151990825968009_1675559805_n-thumb.jpg,"Are you going through the motions in your marriage or committed relationship? Are you like roommates who occasionally have sex? Do you miss when you were first together, all the lovey-dovey moments and the passion? That feeling of boyfriend and girlfriend, where your face lights up when they come in the room because of the way they look at you?I realized I wanted that boyfriend-ness back while writing my romance novel. There's nothing like falling in love. Since we really don't want to have to find new interests every year, we have to reinvent our own relationships. I don't want the kind of marriage where they've been together for 25 years and sleep in different rooms. I want to be married to my boyfriend for 50+ years. Is that practical? Hell yeah. It's all in the energy you create in your relationship. It's not just about the sex either, because most of us are very busy with careers and kids and bedroom time is only a fraction of our lives. I'm all for hot sex, which is obvious, because I've just had my fifth child. My husband is getting fixed now, 'cause we're too good... Fertile Myrtle and Super Sperm over here! He works a lot and sometimes I'm asleep by the time he gets home, but we make it a priority to squeeze in time together when we can. We've figured out it's quality over quantity and humor is a love potion. Texting has become a godsend in our relationship. We send each other pictures. If it's not PG, you must make sure you text the right person. Giggling... but hey, we're adults. When he texts me, ""Thinking of you,"" it makes my day. We've been married for 17 years. In the beginning, I was a pain in the ass. I nitpicked and wasn't flexible. I was also 19. In my twenties, my husband worked even more than now. I was stressed with kids and he was stressed about work and money. When he was home he wasn't really present. I would bitch and complain about the kids. We were disconnected. We've learned over the years not to ask, ""How was your day?"" and spend all this time going back into the negative space of what so-and-so did at work, or which one of our kids hit the other. Our youngest son can have a trucker mouth and truth be told, I really don't care about what dramas go on at his work. We give each other the good parts of the day and what's actually important to us. Now we say, ""What do you want to talk about?"" We've recreated our relationship, enhanced it, and made it even richer and more fulfilling. It's all about our intention and focus. I look back and see that I wasn't happy and looked to blame him sometimes. I looked for his shortcomings because I was focused on mine. When I worked on myself, my relationship got so much better. The old school, obey-your-husband, head-of-the-household stuff doesn't work for me. We're equals here. I work on our relationship for me. It's great for my kids to see loving parents, but it isn't even about doing the right thing here, because I don't buy into being the ""good"" girl, nice person thing. I want to feel good. Life is too short not to. Instead of whining about him not wining and dining you, or it's not all champagne and roses, you can think about romance differently and DO something about it. I don't need expensive jewelry for Valentine's Day. I'd never reject bling, but just give me a $20 bottle of wine and chocolate... lots. I love funny cards as much as sentimental ones. I think real love is him cleaning the bathroom or surprising me with a bagel or scone in the morning. I'm easy to please, just feed me! Maybe yours is him taking you to a chick-flick, doing yard work, taking care of dinner by ordering out or doing math homework with the kids. (Algebra is like Japanese to me.) Get the ball rolling by kindly asking for what you want. I prefer an expensive restaurant a few times a year over a chain restaurant once a month, but I schedule our dates and don't wait for him to. I tell him how much I appreciate things he does for me. Gratitude makes both parties feel good. I believe in nurturing our relationship. I think of my marriage as a piggy bank; the more I put into it, the more I get out of it. I don't keep score about love. I own my shit. I don't make him responsible for my happiness. If I need something from him, I tell him. I'm honest about where I am coming from. I treat him like my best friend. We don't need to be with each other all the time or watch the same TV shows. He wouldn't watch ""Real Housewives"" if I paid him with sex, beer AND money. We do agree on Anthony Bourdain's show, ""House Hunters International,"" stand-up comedy, science shows and ""Friends"" reruns. We sit with each other and cuddle. We make it a must to hug every day. We don't believe in having a perfect life, but rather perfect moments. We're not a sitcom. Our kids fight like cats and dogs. We have clutter. I cannot imagine my life without him in our home with dust, over-stuffed closets, too many junk drawers and lots of yelling. We do lots of silliness here to counterbalance the yelling. No one holds back their feelings here. My tips: Text him both sexy and sweet messages. Own your beauty. There is nothing sexier than a happy, confident woman who can ask for what she wants in the bedroom. Make sex fun for you. Work on yourself. Be his girlfriend. Create your own magic, your love potion is you. Say ""I love you,"" often. "
1,PARENTING,A Tale of Two Uncles: Teaching My Kids About Sexual Orientation,"Stephanie Sprenger, Contributor
writer, editor, blogger at Mommy, for Real",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-tale-of-two-uncles_us_5b9dd652e4b03a1dcc8d927d,"What's the statute of limitations on bringing up questions that should have, theoretically, been answered years earlier?",2014-02-04,2014-02-04-522471_583359681675410_152632292_n1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-04-522471_583359681675410_152632292_n1-thumb.jpg,"My brother's partner came into our lives when my oldest daughter, Izzy, was 3 years old, months before I became pregnant with my second child. Ingenuous and trusting, Izzy led him by the hand into her bedroom and spent the next 20 minutes doing puzzles with her new ""best buddy,"" Brandon. To this day, over four years later, she still refers to him as her ""best buddy,"" and always rushes to greet Brandon before she hugs her biological uncle. In the months that followed their introduction, a baptism by play, I wondered if my preschooler would ask me why Uncle Brian always brought Brandon along when he visited our home. I found it difficult to gauge exactly how much she understood about their connection; the greater challenge was determining whether I was supposed to do something to illumine the nature of their relationship. By the time they had been together long enough to refer to them as ""the uncles,"" my daughter had turned 6, and it seemed awkward to initiate a conversation on the details of their partnership. It seemed a bit like asking someone's name after you have spent months sitting next to her at PTA meetings and it was implied that you already knew it, because clearly, she knew yours. What's the statute of limitations on bringing up questions that should have, theoretically, been answered years earlier? Explaining the partnership of the gay uncles seemed to fall into the list of topics that I kept waiting to arise -- but never did. The complicated, multi-layered conversations such as, ""From where, exactly, did my baby sister exit your body?"" and, ""How precisely did she get in there?"" or maybe even, ""Why do I have so many grandmas?"" I was certain, with her constant chatter and never-ending curiosity, that we would be broaching these delicate subjects sometime soon, but I never wanted to push those crucial discussions about reproduction, divorce or the mechanics of childbirth before it was time. In the same vein, it seemed disingenuous to insist on a formal debriefing on same-sex relationships, but I worried that by avoiding educating my daughter, I would be inadvertently sending a message that I was uncomfortable with their relationship, or that there was something innately wrong with gay partnerships. The last thing I wanted was for our family to unconsciously bury the uncles' sexual orientation as one of the ""things we don't talk about."" I knew that our daughters would grow up supporting gay rights and feeling proud that their uncles were an important part of the family; I just didn't know when we would teach them about gay marriage, court rulings and prejudice. Truth be told, I had absolutely no idea whether my 6-year-old intuitively grasped the fact that the uncles are together. I continued to wait for a day when my daughter might ponder aloud, ""Hey Mommy, I know that Uncle Brian is your brother, but why is Brandon my uncle, too?"" or maybe, ""Why doesn't Uncle Brian have a wife? Why does he live with Uncle Brandon?"" Then one day, the opportunity naturally presented itself. On an early morning drive to school, my burgeoning young reader, with her infinite creativity, began reading the exit signs aloud. ""What if Kipling and Ward got married?"" she began, inventing her own interstate love story. ""Which one do you think would be the boy? Kipling or Ward? Is Kipling a girl's name or a boy's name?""I saw my moment, and I seized it. ""What if Kipling and Ward were both boys?"" I asked her tentatively. ""Could they still get married?""  ""No,"" she said dismissively.""Actually, yes, they could,"" I replied, ignoring the nauseating legal technicality that in our state, no, they couldn't. ""Boys can marry boys, and girls can marry girls, if they love each other."" ""Oh yeah,"" she said slowly. ""Like Uncle Brian and Uncle Brandon!"" Yes, I thought. She does get it. ""Did Uncle Brian and Uncle Brandon have a wedding?"" she asked, ""With flowers and music?"" ""No,"" I answered, ""Not yet. But maybe someday they will."" My youngest daughter is not yet 2, and such questions would never occur to her. I recently observed a fascinating phenomenon; my toddler seems to believe that the uncles share the same name. I was curious why she only talked about ""Bandon"" and never mentioned my brother, so one day, as she sat between them on the couch, I asked her, ""Where's Uncle Brandon?"" She looked slowly back and forth between the two of them, unable to respond, her mind having thoroughly been blown. Given the fact that my brother is 6'4, bearded and as white as humanly possible, and his partner is average height, clean shaven and Black, it would be hard to imagine she has somehow mixed them up. Rather, she appears to perceive them as one entity. In her tiny brain, her uncles are united. Since our illuminating car ride discussion, the uncles have become engaged. They plan to get married next spring, after Brandon completes his graduate program. I can only hope that by the year 2015, our state legislation will have caught up with the benevolent, intuitive brain of my toddler, and she can walk down the aisle, in her home state, as their flower girl.

Chief symptoms are persistent blockage of airflow from the lungs and difficulty breathing. Tobacco smoke is the leading cause, with significant risk factors also posed by indoor air pollution from solid fuels used for cooking and workplace exposure to chemical fumes, dust, and other irritants. COPD's worldwide prevalence is increasing; some research predicts a 30 percent increase in deaths over the next decade, with annual mortality exceeding 6 million people. Current therapies aim to ease breathing and relieve symptoms, but there is no cure. However, recent analysis by the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters has shown COPD-related research shifts, activity in the drug pipeline and patent filings that indicate a greater focus on a future of preventive therapies.Thomson Reuters created ""The Future of COPD,"" the infographic (below) that summarizes the latest pharmaceutical research, activity in the drug pipeline and patent filings around a new class of preventive treatments -- such as p38 kinase inhibitors -- currently under investigation for treating and preventing COPD.For a snapshot of COPD research and its principal players over the last decade, Thomson Reuters turned to the Web of Science, the premier research platform for information in the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. A search on COPD produced more than 26,000 pertinent papers. This sample afforded listings of the most-cited reports, along with the most prolific researchers and institutions.
