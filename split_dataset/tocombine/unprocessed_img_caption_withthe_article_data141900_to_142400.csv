0,QUEER VOICES,Why Drag Queens Are Better Role Models Than Disney Princesses,"Joy Martin-Malone, Contributor
Mother/Writer/Blogger based in Portland, Oregon, thecattownmur...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drag-queens_us_5bafbb4ae4b0ad7692610022,"Imagine my horror when my toddlers took to Disney princesses. The feminist inside me wept -- until, eavesdropping on their usual princess gab, I overheard the following statement: ""My favorite princess is Ariel, and yours is Cinderella, and Mommy's favorite princess is Sharon Needles.""",2013-09-29,"NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 30: Sharon Needles attends Logo TV's Official Pride NYC 2013 Event at Highline Ballroom on June 30, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbb4a2400005100551142.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An earlier version of this blog post originally appeared on MamaPop.The moment that I learned of the twin girls in my belly, I resolved not to send two hoes into the world. I'd teach them that self-expression is always more important than playing nice, and I'd warn them that waiting around for someone else to make their dreams come true is not only futile but downright scallywag.So imagine my horror when my toddlers took to Disney princesses. And it goes beyond merely watching the movies and buying the merchandise: My girls have lived as those characters for the past three years. They've all but forgotten how to count to 5, but they can curtsy, smile and gasp on cue. The standard name for each color has been replaced by the name of the princess with the corresponding branding: ""Belle"" for ""yellow,"" ""Tiana"" for ""green,"" ""Cinderella"" for ""blue,"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" for ""pink,"" etc. The feminist inside me wept -- until, eavesdropping on their usual princess gab, I overheard the following statement:""My favorite princess is Ariel, and yours is Cinderella, and Mommy's favorite princess is Sharon Needles.""Then and there, the door blew open. You see, Sharon Needles is not just a princess but a queen, a strong, creative, groundbreaking, wickedly brilliant queen. I suddenly realized that there was more than one direction that I could push the princess mania, because my children could not distinguish between a Disney princess and a drag queen.Indeed, the parallels between the two are downright uncanny. Both wear grandiose costumes and perform signature songs. Big hair is an absolute staple across the board. Both have been known to make their shining debut at the local ball. And, like it or not, a midnight transformation is all but inevitable. I couldn't help the pride swelling inside me at the thought of the possibilities, mainly because I despise Disney princesses. Regardless of the amount of money that I've pumped into their franchise, I feel that the psychology behind the tiara is a mockery of the values that I swore to instill in my daughters. Meanwhile, shoving your balls into your pelvic cavity might not make you a real woman, but it doesn't preclude you from being a better role model than a Disney princess.Let's start with the obvious discrimination in the princess community, shall we? While most of the princesses are still blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girls, Disney has conjured a half-assed attempt to include a few other cultures, so you have Mulan, Jasmine and Pocahontas breaking the Aryan glass ceiling, though you'd have a hard time finding them anywhere but in the back row. It only took Disney 86 years to drop its Jim Crow laws and allow Tiana, the black princess, an invitation to the ball. But discrimination in the drag community? I'm pretty sure that the only requirement is to have a penis duct-taped between your legs; other than that, anything goes.Secondly, ever wonder how those princesses are getting their fancy gowns and blinged-out crowns? Of the 11 Disney princesses currently included in the franchise, only one has ever had a job. (Apparently Tiana was born with such a socioeconomic disadvantage that she had to work two jobs to even attempt to make her big princess dreams a reality. [See also: discrimination.] And after all that hard work, she still couldn't seem to get ahead until she locked down a prince whose family could buy her those dreams.) Drag queens, on the other hand, have a strong work ethic. Basically, if a queen isn't working her butt pads off, she isn't making tips. No one is going to pay to watch a man put on a sequined dress and sit in the middle of the dance floor.Finally, in the world of drag, a sense of humor is as fundamental as proper padding and the ability to ""read."" You won't find a money-making queen who doesn't camp it up with her audience. Laughter is what helps us persevere; it lifts us out of our struggles. Yet I can't recall one princess with the ability to laugh at her ridiculous plights. If you've lost your parents only to be enslaved in a rat-infested tower, your tone should be more sarcastic than Arrested Development meets Curb Your Enthusiasm. Instead, the princesses always awaken into a smiling song -- a clear red flag, in my opinion. Stepmother had better check the cellar for a hidden artillery of crockpot explosives.When it comes down to it, I respect drag queens. They are artists. They are able to conceptualize an idea and transform themselves -- without the help of magic, I might add. They are risk takers. They are punk. But Disney princesses? They are a man-made franchise created to sell cheaply made shit to our daughters. They are a perpetuation of the stereotype of the weak, dumb woman who obediently waits for a man to come along and make her valuable. Between the two I'll always promote the big-wigged man crooning ""I'm Every Woman.""

Recently-published figures from the United Nations support this view. More than 45 million immigrants live in the U.S., according to UN figures, more than four times as many living in any other nation in the world.Based on figures recently released by the UN’s Population Division, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight nations with the highest total number of international migrants living inside their borders as of this year. These are the countries with the most immigrants.Click here to see the top immigration destinationsSeveral of the nations with the highest migrant populations are also among the world’s most populous. Both the U.S., and Russia are all among the 10 most populous countries in the world. Five of the eight nations are among the world’s 30 most populous nations.Despite having large migrant populations, many of these nations do not have policies that actively support immigration. In fact, according to the UN, the governments of Saudi Arabia, France, the United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates all promoted policies aimed at lowering the level of immigration into their countries, as of 2011. Only one of these nations, Russia, actively promoted immigration into their country as of 2011.Most of these countries maintain different, more-accommodating policies for high-skilled workers than for most other potential immigrants, according to Vinod Mishra, chief of the population policy section of the United Nations Population Division. “It’s mostly the [number of] highly-skilled workers that almost all countries are trying to raise,” Mishra told 24/7 Wall St.The actual immigration trends in these countries do not necessarily reflect the policies their governments have tried to enforce. Russia, which has actively sought to increase immigration, has had its immigrant population fall by 10 percent since 2010. Germany, which has sought to recruit highly-skilled workers from slumping Euro zone nations, has failed to retain many of the skilled workers that arrive there, and has also experienced a meaningful decrease in its immigrant population.Similarly, all four nations whose governments viewed immigration as too high as of 2011 have seen immigrant populations rise between 2010 and 2013. In one such nation, the UAE, the number of immigrants has more-than doubled in that time.One reason for the disparity between policy and migration rates is that some nations are more appealing to potential immigrants than others. The U.S.’s GDP per capita was more than $49,900 in 2012, among the highest in the world. All but one of the countries leading the world in immigrant population were among the top 30 countries in the world for per capita GDP in 2012. Mishra added that while nations can determine how many people they allow in, the decision to move to a certain nation is largely driven by demand. And the primary driver of demand, according to Mishra, are “financial factors [and] the availability of jobs.”To determine the nations with the most immigrants as of July 1 2013, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed figures published by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ Population Division as part of its International Migration 2013 report. Information about governments’ attitudes and policies towards immigration and emigration, as well as statistics on the total number of international migrants from 2010, comes from the Population Division’s International Migration Policies 2013 report. Per capita GDP figures, which are adjusted to reflect purchasing power parity exchange rates, are from the IMF. Other measures, used to guage a nation’s attractiveness, are from the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014.These are the countries with the most immigrants, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

Clubs such as Washington, Philadelphia, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, and Atlanta all thought they were going to be in the hunt for a division title. The way things have started out, that’s not the case. If they lose another game, they could be on the outside looking in after only a quarter of the season. This week is very important for all these teams if they hope to turn around slow starts.Washington at OaklandMany thought the Redskins would be the NFC East’s best team. The offense has moved the ball, averaging over 370 yards a game and they have scored at a rate of 22 points a game. The problem has been too many missed opportunities that have cost them. The defense is giving up over 485 yards a game and can’t get off the field.The Raiders may be without Terrelle Pryor, but they have a strong rushing attack. That’s something Washington can’t stop. Even if Matt Flynn has to play, the Raiders may be able to put up yards and points. If the Redskins lose another and go to 0-4, the season is just about over.New England at AtlantaProbably one of the biggest surprises of this young season is the Falcons starting 1-2. Atlanta is banged up and won’t be completely healthy for this game. New England is 3-0 but they really haven’t played anyone yet. They were lucky to beat Buffalo in the opener and their other wins were against the Jets and Tampa Bay. Tom Brady has the most inexperienced group of receivers he has ever had. He has no one he can count on. This game is in Atlanta, and I look for the Falcons to bounce back and even their record at 2-2.Philadelphia at DenverThe fast paced offense of Philly has been just about as good as people thought it would be. They have picked up large chunks yardage and can score points quickly. The problem is the defense can’t stop the Little Sisters of the Poor. The odd part of this is the Eagles spent millions in free agency to shore up the defense.Denver has looked like the class of the AFC West in starting out 3-0, and Peyton Manning is playing like his old self. It will be interesting to see how Philly’s offense reacts to playing at a quick pace in the thin air of Denver. They may have to slow things down for their own good. I look for Denver to win this game easily.Pittsburgh vs. Minnesota (in London)A month ago this game looked like it may be the game of the week. It is the game of the week...in London. Who would have thought that both teams would be 0-3? Pittsburgh has struggled on offense but did show signs of life last week in the second half against Chicago. The usually stout Steelers' defense has been giving up points and yards. That should be good news for the Vikings, but they will be playing without starting quarterback Christian Ponder. With Matt Cassel at quarterback this week, who knows what to expect. He was a huge disappointment during his time in Kansas City. While Adrian Peterson is one of the most dangerous running backs in the NFL, except for one big run on opening day, he has been ordinary so far this year. In my eyes, this game is even, but the Steelers' pride might be the difference in the end.Follow me on Twitter - @greggabe"

(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb71053240000310056ee89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joel Corry, National Football PostAt the start of each NFL season, there are unemployed players that were starters or significant contributors during the previous season. The best bet for unsigned players to find roster spots is through injury, which is inevitable in the NFL. Here’s a look at some of the more notable players that are available.QuarterbacksDavid Carr: The first overall pick in the 2002 NFL draft lost a pre-season battle with Curtis Painter to backup Eli Manning. Carr had spent four of the last five seasons with the New York Giants when he was released. Vince Young: The 2006 Offensive Rookie of the Year’s quest to become the Green Bay Packers’ backup quarterback fell short. General Manager Ted Thompson put some of the blame on himself because Young was signed after training camp started. Young, who hasn’t played in the NFL since 2011 with the Philadelphia Eagles, has a 31-19 record as a starter.Others: Trent Edwards, Graham Harrell, Byron Leftwich, Matt Leinart, John Skelton, Tim TebowRunning BacksPeyton Hillis: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers released Hillis after he was inactive for the first two games of the season. Hillis’ career has been on a downward spiral ever since he rushed for 1,177 yards with the Cleveland Browns in 2010.Michael Turner: Turner was a salary cap casualty in March when the Atlanta Falcons decided his $6.9 million salary was too much for a 31 year old running back with declining production. His 800 rushing yards with 3.6 yards per carry in 2012 were the lowest totals during his five seasons with the Falcons.Others: Cedric Benson, Tim Hightower, Joe McKnight, Chris Rainey, Beanie WellsWide ReceiversLavelle Hawkins: The Patriots released Hawkins early in training camp because they were comfortable with their rookie wide receivers. Hawkins quickly signed with the San Francisco 49ers but didn’t make the team despite a productive pre-season. He has worked out for the Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions since the 49ers released him.Laurent Robinson: The Jacksonville Jaguars released Robinson after a series of concussions limited him to seven games in 2012 despite a $2 million guaranteed roster bonus. Robinson has worked out for several teams since receiving medical clearance for his concussions in July. Some teams view Robinson as a medical risk because of the concussions.Others: Steve Breaston, Braylon Edwards, Brandon Lloyd (retired?), Mohamed Massaquoi, David Nelson, Courtney RobyTight EndsJake Ballard: Ballard missed the entire 2012 season recovering from microfracture surgery and ACL reconstruction. He sustained his knee injury while playing for the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI against the New England Patriots. The emergence of rookie Zach Sudfeld and Ballard’s inability to regain his pre-injury form made him expendable to the Patriots. The Baltimore Ravens recently brought Ballard in for a workout.Others: Daniel Fells, Todd Heap, Visanthe ShiancoeOffensive LinemenLance Louis (OG): The Miami Dolphins cut Louis because of his slower than expected recovery from an ACL tear in his right knee. He was viewed as a potential starter at right guard when the Dolphins signed him in March. Louis had been a two-year starter with the Chicago Bears when he suffered the injury last November.Jason Smith (OT): The second overall pick in the 2009 NFL draft hasn’t lived up to expectations. He spent the 2012 season with the New York Jets as a backup after the St. Louis Rams traded him for Wayne Hunter shortly before the start of the regular season. The New Orleans Saints signed him to compete with Charles Brown at left tackle. Smith was released after Brown easily won the starting job in training camp. He quickly re-signed with the Jets but he didn’t make the roster. The San Francisco 49ers and Tennessee Titans have worked out Smith since the Jets released him.Others: Jammal Brown, (OT), Jared Gaither (OT), Stephen Peterman (OG)Defensive LinemenAndre Carter (DE): The Oakland Raiders released Carter because of his inability to generate a pass rush during the pre-season. Carter worked out for the New England Patriots recently. He earned the lone Pro Bowl selection of his career with the Patriots in 2011 when he had 10 sacks in 14 games.Richard Seymour (DT): The Atlanta Falcons were interested in Seymour during the off-season but his price tag was too high. Seymour will remain on the sidelines unless he lowers his salary demands.Others: Mark Anderson (DE), Justin Bannan (DT), Rocky Bernard (DT), Casey Hampton (DT), Lawrence Jackson (DE), Sione Po’uha (DT), Kyle Vanden Bosch (DE)LinebackersLeroy Hill (OLB): A January domestic violence incident in which Hill faced felony charges likely contributed to the lack of interest in free agency. Hill, who started 12 games for the Seattle Seahawks in 2012, has worked out for the Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans since the charges were dropped in late July.Takeo Spikes (ILB): The 15 year veteran was released by the San Diego Chargers in March primarily because of a new head coach and general manager being hired. Spikes had 66.23% playtime with the Chargers in 2012. The San Francisco 49ers expressed some interest in Spikes during the pre-season.Others: Michael Boley, (OLB), Jo-Lonn Dunbar (OLB), Thomas Howard (OLB), Barrett Rudd (ILB)Defensive BacksKenny Phillips (S): Phillips inability to shake the injury bug that plagued him when he was with the New York Giants kept him from making the Philadelphia Eagles. He was limited to one pre-season game because of a quadriceps injury.Kerry Rhodes (S): Rhodes, a starter in 116 of his 118 career games, hasn’t generated much interest around the NFL since the Arizona Cardinals released him in March after he refused to take a paycut. The New York Giants brought Rhodes in for a workout last week. Rhodes was the fourth ranked safety in 2012 according the Pro Football Focus.Antoine Winfield (CB): The three-time Pro Bowler announced his retirement after the Seattle Seahawks released him at the final roster cutdown. He had limited value to Seattle with Walter Thurmond winning the third cornerback spot because 36 year olds usually aren’t big special teams contributors. Winfield has had a change of heart about retiring. He’s interested in playing this season under the right circumstances.Others: Ronald Bartell (CB), Stanford Routt (CB), James Sanders (S), Marcus Trufant (CB)Kickers/PuntersShayne Graham (K): Shayne Graham was expected to fill the shoes of Phil Dawson with the Cleveland Browns but was a surprise cut. He spent a week with the Pittsburgh Steelers as an insurance policy when Shaun Suisham injured his hamstring. The Steelers released Graham because of Suisham’s quick recovery.Chris Kluwe (P): Kluwe lost a pre-season competition with Marquette King for the Oakland Raiders punting job. King is leading the NFL with a 50.7 yard gross punting average.Others: Olindo Mare (K), Mat McBriar (P), Neil Rackers (K) Follow me on Twitter: @corryjoelJoel Corry is a former sports agent who helped found Premier Sports & Entertainment, a sports management firm that represents professional athletes and coaches.

For one thing, that's where the escalator from the lobby takes you, and by the time you've finished scrutinizing those second-floor exhibits you're ready for a beer. But the other galleries are full of real treasures too. For instance, gallery 31 on the first floor (i.e. one flight up), contains paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures of twentieth-century figures from composers to politicians to prize-fighters. In one corner of the room, until February 14, 2014, are drawings of three French chefs who worked in London in the 1930s by Florence Enid Stoddard (1882-1962). To me, the interest lies in the depiction of these chefs -- who were at the top of their profession -- not as grease-spattered toilers in steamy basement kitchens but as dignified artisan-managers. In other words, they're drawn the way we think of prominent chefs nowadays: as figures to be admired as creators, not despised as servants.If you're within striking distance of Trafalgar Square, you should be visiting the National Portrait Gallery anyway, and if you go, be sure to take the stairs, not the escalator, so you can have a look at these drawings and the surrounding exhibits."

He wrote her a note on a napkin, bravely walked up to her seat and placed it under her drink. She ignored him, even after tapping her on the shoulder. Two weeks later, Lazaro received a call from Michael Kors, who said Wintour gave him a letter from a kid on the plane and that Kors should hire him as an intern. The rest is history. Moral of the story: Grow some balls and go for it.We can't even imagine the bravery Lazaro must have had to muster to invade first class, or how it felt to be ignored by Anna.

The exchange could reflect a major step in resolving global concerns over Iran's nuclear program. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2feaa210000e700c7aa5b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sharon BegleyNEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Just days before the launch of the new U.S. state health insurance exchanges that are the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, a nationwide push is still under way to test and patch the technology behind the online sites.Officials working on the sites have acknowledged that information technology (IT) failures will prevent many of them from functioning fully for weeks, and perhaps longer. That will slow the government's drive to enroll millions of uninsured Americans under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law starting Tuesday.From a political standpoint, a successful opening day will shape perceptions of Obama's signature policy initiative. But the system's functioning is to a large extent beyond the control of politicians and policy experts, and instead sits in the hands of the battalions of coders working for IT sub-contractors.Six months ago, people involved in setting up the exchanges were more hopeful that everything would be ready on time, said Cristine Vogel, an associate director at Navigant Consulting.""I don't think there were enough hours in the day, or enough people with the skills,"" she said. ""When we look back, I think we'll see that we missed an opportunity to share technology.""Opponents of the healthcare reform known as Obamacare say the computer problems bolster their view that the 2010 law is a ""train wreck"" and should be delayed or repealed. The Obama administration insists the exchanges will be open for business on Oct. 1, even if some uninsured Americans may not be able to buy coverage right away. More importantly, they say, the new health plans will begin to provide health coverage on Jan. 1, as planned.""So long as the website is accessible and the plans and the plan information are displayed properly so a consumer can shop for coverage and compare the plans, they will claim victory,"" said Chris C1ondeluci, an employee benefits attorney at Venable LLP and a former staffer at the Senate Finance Committee who helped draft the Affordable Care Act. FIRST-DAY CRASH?This week, the Obama administration said its Spanish-language website would not be ready in time, and that it would be weeks before small businesses and their employees could sign up online for coverage on exchanges operated by the federal government.The exchanges in Colorado and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, cannot calculate the amount of federal subsidies customers qualify for.In New York, the exchange is not able to transfer data to some insurers instantaneously, as planned, one carrier told Reuters. Instead, the data will be sent in batches once a day or so. The glitch will not affect customers, but it raises questions that New York might have other IT problems.Oregon had sufficient qualms about its online insurance marketplace that no one can enroll unless they use a trained, certified agent or other ""community partner.""As late as this week, Oregon also had trouble correctly displaying information about insurance plans on a test site. The problem could mislead customers about deductibles, prices and other details if it occurs on the live site Tuesday.In Ohio, Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor, a fierce opponent of the healthcare law, said in a radio interview this week that her state's online exchange, which is being run by the federal government, could well crash on its first day.In testing, she said, some plans filed by insurers ""sat in a queue for the federal government for a week, so my concern is something similar is going to happen on October 1 because of the amount of (online) traffic."" WORKAROUNDS OFFERED, TAKE TIMEIn most cases, exchanges will offer workarounds that will take time to execute. In Washington, D.C., off-line contractors will calculate federal subsidies and inform applicants what they qualify for in November, by which time the online calculator might be working.In Colorado, until at least November, customers will have to call phone service centers, where representatives will manually take them through the calculations to determine what subsidies they qualify for.Even before the exchanges open, the finger-pointing has begun, with states blaming contractors for glitches and contractors blaming states or other contractors.The system to calculate federal subsidies for the D.C. exchange was built by Curam Software, which IBM acquired in 2011. In tests of complex family situations, the software was getting subsidies wrong 15 percent of the time, said exchange spokesman Richard Sorian.In a statement, IBM spokesman Mitchell Derman said the city ""decided that a phased-in approach best meets the needs of its citizens."" He pointed out that Curam also built the eligibility software in Maryland and Minnesota, ""two states that plan to have full functionality on Oct. 1.""In other words, a company that achieved its goal on time in two states fell short in a third. The reasons, said outside experts, include relationships among contractors and the specifics of existing computer systems in a state.In Washington, Infosys, the giant Bangalore, India,-based technology company, is the system integrator - the contractor that takes software from sub-contractors like Curam and puts it all together. The fact that Curam's calculation software is working on other exchanges suggests the glitch may not lie in its integration with the D.C. exchange's other IT.""A software package like Curam's is put into the system by the system implementer, not the software provider,"" said an IT expert not involved in the D.C. exchange. A spokesman for Infosys was not able to comment on its D.C. work. MEDICAID SYSTEMS POSE HUGE HURDLEOne of the most difficult IT jobs has been to integrate each health insurance exchange with its state Medicaid system. These legacy systems are typically decades old. In Massachusetts, for instance, the system runs on the COBOL programming language, which is to today's languages like a rotary phone is to an iPhone-5.""These legacy systems are old and difficult to configure and re-configure,"" said Tom Dehner, managing principal at Health Management Associates, a healthcare consultant, in Boston and former director of Massachusetts Medicaid.""To change how eligibility is calculated,"" as federal law now requires, he said, ""you need to modify your Medicaid system, and that's not something you can do by buying software off the shelf.""The difficulty of interfacing with Medicaid will keep Colorado's exchange from calculating subsidies online.To determine eligibility for federal subsidies, explained Nathan Wilkes, a member of the board of Connect for Health Colorado, the system ""first goes through Medicaid determination. That means connecting to a legacy system,"" he said.""Six or nine months ago we got an early warning that the way we wanted to integrate these systems wouldn't work, and then time got away from us.""Colorado's exchange tested 100,000 scenarios to see how its software calculated subsidies, and got error after error.""It's an IT nightmare,"" Wilkes said."

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2fea5250000320038999a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shortly before the debut of the biggest element of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, nearly two-thirds of Americans -- and almost three-quarters of the uninsured -- still don't know what's coming, according to a poll released Saturday.Obamacare's health insurance exchanges, the online marketplaces in every state for the uninsured and people who don't get health benefits at work, are scheduled to open for business on Tuesday. The Obama administration, many states and partners in the private sector have been promoting the exchanges for months to little measurable effect, the survey conducted by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows.The health care reform law is projected to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 14 million next year, and millions more over the coming decade. But those numbers won't budge unless millions of consumers use the exchanges to shop for coverage and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance or Medicaid benefits. These latest poll findings, which are consistent with surveys taken since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, show how much work is left to be done by the White House and others who want the largest expansion of health care in decades to succeed. The Kaiser Family Foundation polled Americans from Sept. 12 to Sept. 18.Just 15 percent of those polled, and only 12 percent of the working-age uninsured, knew the exchanges were launching in October for the start of a six-month sign-up period. Sixty-five percent of respondents were aware that Obamacare created the exchanges, however. Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationThe survey found that more than three years after the law's enactment, 51 percent of Americans felt as though they didn't understand it well enough to determine how it will affect them and their families. More than two-thirds of the uninsured -- those who stand to gain the most -- said the same. More than half of respondents said the news media focuses mainly on the politics of health care reform, rather than on how it affects people. A majority also said there was no news source they could trust to provide information about the law.Asked what questions they would most like answered, Americans most commonly wanted to know how much health insurance would cost under Obamacare, how the spending is financed, and where they can find a simple summary of the law.The survey demonstrates just how poorly informed, and often misinformed, Americans are about what's in the Affordable Care Act.The best-known aspect of the law is the controversial individual mandate that nearly every legal U.S. resident obtain health coverage or face a tax penalty: 79 percent said they were aware of the provision. Majorities also knew about other key features such as the ability of states to expand Medicaid to more poor people and the ban on health insurance companies' rejecting people with pre-existing conditions.But significant numbers of Americans also continue to believe various fictions about Obamacare. More than 40 percent of those surveyed said, incorrectly, that so-called death panels will decide how to treat Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives, that Medicare benefits have been reduced and that undocumented immigrants will receive money to pay for health insurance. None of those things is true.More than half of those surveyed said the law includes a ""public option,"" a government-run insurance plan that was proposed but rejected by Congress and is not part of the law.Overall, a larger percentage of Americans view the health care reform law unfavorably than favorably: 43 percent vs. 39 percent.  Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationThe survey results also showed a sharp and persistent partisan divide. More than two-thirds of Democrats have a favorable opinion of Obamacare, compared to 11 percent of Republicans and 34 percent of independents. Ongoing Republican efforts to thwart the law, including the current attempts to defund it, are opposed by a majority -- but are popular among Republicans, especially those who identify with the tea party movement."

During a press conference at the Zurich Film Festival, where ""Gravity"" will screen on Monday, the director said only a ""handful"" of films use the technique to their advantage. “The problem now is that they make all these films that are not designed for 3-D and then convert them as a commercially afterthought -- and they are crap,"" Cuaron said. ""They don't follow the rules of 3-D of what does and doesn’t work.""Cuaron acknowledged that 3-D can be an ""amazing tool"" when used in a ""proper way."" Reviews of ""Gravity,"" which stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, indicate Cuaron's use is one of those ""proper"" approaches. Critics have almost unanimously praised the film's ""astonishing"" (Entertainment Weekly) and ""beautifully choreographed"" (The Hollywood Reporter) visuals. It appears a good chunk of the moviegoing population agrees with Cuaron's assessment. Shares for RealD, the 3-D technology projection company, hit all-time lows this month after August ticket sales proved especially disappointing. The summer's 3-D offerings, namely lucrative releases such as ""Despicable Me 2"" and ""The Wolverine,"" were trumped by their 2-D counterparts. Whether Cuaron will use the technology in his future work is yet to be seen, but he's unlikely to set his next movie in space. “I now want to work on films in which people walk,"" Cuaron half-joked at the film festival. ""I feel very strongly about this. If they walk, lay down, sit in wheelchairs or even swim, that would be fantastic.”[via ScreenDaily]"
