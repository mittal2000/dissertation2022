Forecasts for tomorrow are predicting temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) and may feel as hot as 106 because of humidity, according to the National weather Service. Much of the midwest of the United States has been experiencing a severe heat wave which has devastated crops and kept people indoors.(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c182d240000310053125d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wondering what to do with teenagers in New York City? So was I. As a single mother of boys, a vacation is more than an excuse to eat too much and do too little. It's an opportunity to get out of the comfort zone, create lasting memories and stimulate that which is mysteriously lost between parent and adolescent: conversation.In my typical Virgo style I set out to take Manhattan by storm, by geographic zone, on time and on a budget. Preparing for our four-hour flight home, we reclined our seats, lowered our tray tables and compiled our list of ""Top Five Fun Things to Do (with Teens) in New York City.""CityPass Iconic New York is a no-brainer and for the touristy things nothing beats the flexibility and diversity of a CityPass. The three-museum, three-attraction combo we chose gave us a nice blend of culture and world-class tourist. Seeing the views from theTop-of-the-Rock in the daytime and the Empire State Building at night gave some geographical context, while Circle Line's speedboat tour, The Beast, brought thrills, spills and the skyline in a New York minute.The Met, MOMA and American Museum of Natural History brought... well, art and mummies. With extended hours at the Metropolitan, we had a chance to sleep in before taking in their vast collection. My eldest is drawn to the moderns, I to the Europeans and the youngest prefers the paintings of the renaissance, making for plenty of time trading (I see your Madonna and Child and raise you a Rothko). If the rooms of furniture were lost on the younger, he bore with me in exchange for an hour in the armory. We took a break for a late lunch at the Lexington Candy Shop and returned to spend the evening hours with the magnificent Egyptians. The MOMA gave the boys face time with the art and artists they know from poster art, coffee cups and mouse pads, but opened the door to the less obvious and more obscure, which made the Chelsea art gallery visits more significant. At the Natural History, let yourself go beyond the ""Night at the Museum"" appeal and let the Hayden Planetarium take you on a ""Journey to the Stars""; three thumbs up.Theater As a family of theater-goers, consensus was that unless we could see Book of Mormon for less than a semester of college, Broadway was out. We agreed on the offbeat and ventured down to the East Village for a night of neon fun. Though you may have seen the Blue Man Group in Vegas, on tour or on a cruise ship; nothing beats the intimate experience at the Astor Place Theatre. The roots and rhythms of this kaleidoscopic narrative run deep with influences that range from tribal to techno, from silent film to performance art. Fast-paced and funny, Blue Man Group is a global party with thought provoking undertones. No not ""thought-provoking"" in the Clybourne Park/Other Desert Cities vein, but enough to fill our post-show walk through Greenwich Village with lively conversation and plenty of recap moments. Nice when you get the boys talking!Wax Appeal Our giggle-fest romp through Madame Tussauds was great for the campy photo-ops. I hadn't been to a wax museum since I was their age and had forgotten how cool they can be. The array of notables brought some teachable moments, introducing them to Dorothy Parker, Jackie O and Malcolm X. Our follow-up spin through Ripley's Believe-it-or-Not started out fine and quirky, but even my 13 year old lost interest halfway through.High Line After 10 days of exploring neighborhoods and wandering the back alleys of Manhattan, the rattle of the trains, the serenade of the city and its citizens, our late afternoon amble on the High Line hit a sweet spot. This urban oasis opened in 2009 and is built upon the bones of an historic, and once condemned, elevated freight rail line known as the West Side Highway. Located on 10th and 11th Avenues, this lush pedestrian park runs from 34th Street to Ganesvoort Street in the Meatpacking District. When I asked the boys why the High Line made the cut, they answered like true New Yorkers. ""It was just cool to be above the crowds, in the buildings and in nature. I love that it's even there."" Recent History Dragging the boys to Wall Street in the mid-day sun was not one of my brighter moments, but the clouds rolled in with a breeze off the Hudson as we entered the serenity of the 9/11 Memorial. I lived in the shadow of the World Trade Center back in the day; my sons were 3 and 7 when the planes took it down, but we shared a silent hour together with our thoughts as we ran our hands over every name inscribed in the bronze parapets (Gabe's idea). The experience is stunning; not really somber but definitely overwhelming. As the water crashes heavily into the pool, falling again into the abyss, all I could think was that this never should have happened. The boys remained contemplative as we journeyed south to the Staten Island Ferry for a bit of perspective. A summer storm washed the Statue of Liberty as we passed and lightening danced off the skyline adding a poetic depth that only happens in New York.There was plenty more to fill out the week. As history buff and real estate agent, I found the  Tenement Museum a fascinating look at American life and the area around Delancey and Orchard, though much hipper than the dangerous days of my youth, still bears strains of its history. We had lunch and a few whispered words at Grand Central Station, and a mid-day stop at the United Nations en route to the Lowe East Side and finished the evening with dinner and gelato in Little Italy. Sunday in the Park included a bike ride, a carousel ride, a row boat ride on the lake, a picnic in Strawberry Fields and lots of eye candy. An easy dinner at the Shake Shack was a great reward for all the calories burned.As the trip progressed, I made adjustments and recognized the need for balance: down time with the activities, lesser known spots with high-traffic tourist spots and after the first night... avoid Times Square whenever possible."
1,DIVORCE,Pot Smoking Vs. Medical Marijuana: What Are The Implications In A Custody Dispute?,"Henry Gornbein, Contributor
Family Law Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pot-smoking-verses-medica_us_5b9c0a83e4b03a1dcc7bee18,"Since the legalization of medical marijuana under certain circumstances in California, Michigan and several other states, there has been a lot of discussion about the implications of this in divorce.",2012-08-06,smoking joint closeup with smoke like unhealthy tobacco,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c0a83250000360035ebb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since the legalization of medical marijuana under certain circumstances in California, Michigan and several other states, there has been a lot of discussion about the implications of this in divorce. I have talked with judges in particular about the impact this has on child custody and parenting time. Marijuana is illegal, and therefore smoking marijuana could definitely have an impact on a divorce, especially if it is being done openly. What about when one spouse has a license for medical marijuana? Can medical marijuana have an impact upon child custody? I believe it can. Can it impact parenting time? Yes, but in both cases, it's a matter of the degree of exposure to the children. If smoking marijuana with a medical license is done out of the presence of children, then it should have little impact. On the other hand, if it is done regularly in the presence of children, it could definitely have an impact on custody and parenting time. In a close case, the non-marijuana smoking spouse could possibly receive primary custody. The primary issue is the exposure of the children to the pot smoking, even with a medical marijuana license. If it is being used every day, then there are issues of second-hand smoke -- especially with regard to marijuana where you can get a contact high. That may certainly have an impact on custody decisions. On the other hand, if the marijuana use is limited -- perhaps to evenings when the children are not around or the days where the parents don't have custody in a shared arrangement -- then it is going to have very little impact.It also depends on whether or not the other spouse is going to make the marijuana use an issue in court by bringing up the amount of exposure and the children's ages. The court's attitude will also impact the ultimate verdict. Some communities are much more liberal with regard to medical marijuana; some communities and courts are much more conservative. Many people believe that marijuana should be legalized entirely and regulated like other drugs, such as alcohol. If this were the case, then marijuana would be treated like alcohol in family court and it would still have an impact on custody decisions, especially if it is used to excess. The reality today is that marijuana is not legal, though medical treatment with marijuana licenses is permissible in certain states. In those cases, I think the analogy should be to alcohol; If someone is an alcoholic, that is definitely going to have an impact on parenting time and custody. If someone is using medical marijuana to a large degree, it would definitely have an impact as well.If I am representing a client where medical marijuana is an issue, here's what I would advise:1. If custody and parenting time are issues in a divorce, I would make sure that my client would agree to not using marijuana in front of the children.2. I would make sure there is a schedule that is strictly adhered to so that the children are not exposed to the marijuana and that there is little danger to them being exposed to the second-hand smoke. This could be done by making sure the smoking is done only when the children are not around and only out of the home. he key is what is in the best interests of the children. However, this is an issue that is to be discussed on a case by case basis between attorney and client. These are my thoughts. Please share yours with us as well."

While I am acutely aware of the distance that exists between us and the copious amounts of water under the proverbial bridge, I also recognize the bond that remains.",2012-08-06,Woman mad at her husband against a white a background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c0e3e2000004e00fd6d4f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My ex-husband and I had only been separated for five months when we signed up our 21-month-old son for his first music class. The class took place early on Saturday mornings, and due to our custody arrangement -- alternate visitation on the weekends -- that meant we would take turns accompanying him to class.From day one, my son was obsessed with the class. He loved the songs, the dancing, the instruments, and especially his teacher. All the other kids sat calmly in their parents' laps, but our son -- a born performer -- couldn't sit still. Instead, he danced around in the center of the circle, making requests for his favorite melodies from class or from his personal repertoire, which grew to include songs by the Beatles, Lionel Richie, and tunes from Leonard Bernstein's ""On the Town."" I jokingly began referring to him as ""The Conductor."" I didn't want to miss seeing my son's exuberance in music class, so even if he was scheduled to be with his dad on a particular Saturday morning, I would often join them for those 45 minutes. My ex always seemed to welcome my presence, and we both agreed that it was good for our son to see us interacting in a friendly way.The first few times the three of us attended class together were extremely difficult for me. The wounds of our broken marriage were still exceptionally raw, and I was teeming with anger at my ex, who had secretly cheated on me for 10 months before announcing that he wanted a divorce -- giving me no warning that our marriage was even in trouble. I was still in a state of shock, processing the reality that we were no longer the nuclear family I thought we would be. That reality was even harder to swallow when we were in a class surrounded by seemingly happy couples. I tried to hide the tears that welled up in my eyes so that our son wouldn't notice. And though it was painful, I was always glad I went. Since then, we have embarked on other activities as a threesome. We have taken our son to his doctor's appointments together and were both present for his first soccer class and his first ""big boy"" haircut at a real barber. For his third birthday, his father and I decided to take him out for a special dinner, where we talked mostly about our son and focused on all his new skills and interests. Our son was very excited for the three of us to be together, and it felt good to be able to do that for him.After that positive experience, my ex suggested we meet monthly for dinner, saying he thought it would be good for our son -- and even for us -- to talk about things we usually only addressed via email or text message. We've been meeting monthly ever since.I look forward to our dinners. It's nice to be able to discuss our son in person with my ex -- the only other person in the world who knows our child as intimately as I do. We also talk about our daily routines to make sure we are on the same page when it comes to discipline, eating, potty training, etc. We have made a very concerted effort to maintain one set of rules between both homes.Occasionally during these dinners, I catch myself shifting into a temporary comfort zone. It feels so normal to be interacting as a family unit -- like we used to. And then I remember that it's only for dinner, and that reality burns. Sometimes, when our son is busy playing out of earshot, I make obnoxious side comments to my ex. I don't intend to do it, but these poisonous barbs just slip out. He rolls his eyes, and we try to move on.But more often than not, I savor the rare moments when my ex and I can once again connect on common ground. While I am acutely aware of the distance that exists between us and the copious amounts of water under the proverbial bridge, I also recognize the bond that remains. And it's not just because we have a child together. We were a couple for seven years, married for three, and went through several major life experiences together. Those connections don't just disappear because we are no longer married. Sometimes it's nice to touch base on our shared history -- like how our parents and siblings are doing, or which of our mutual friends got married and are having babies -- even if it reminds me of the relationship I lost. I trust that I will find that type of intimate relationship with another partner someday. For now, I'm proud that my ex-husband and I can rise above our own issues and be more than just civil in front of our child -- we can be friendly. Our son enjoys these dinners and looks forward to them. Just last week he said, ""Mommy, I want to have dinner with you and Daddy soon"" -- so of course, we made it happen.I know of a couple who got divorced under very similar circumstances and many years later they are friends again. They attend family events together with their new spouses and share in these occasions with their children. I hope that my ex-husband and I will also become real friends someday. Though I don't expect him to be my best friend like he once was, I believe that these shared experiences will grow easier and become more enjoyable over time.The dinners started at our son's third birthday, but they are a gift we keep giving him -- and ourselves -- month after month."

4,WELLNESS,The Art of Living: Skydiving,"Kate Moulene, Contributor
Founder of Capian Enterprises",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/skydiving_us_5b9c1386e4b03a1dcc7c2aa9,"The decision to freefall 13,000 feet out of a plane came after a family vote of ""what to do tomorrow"" while vacationing in Hawaii.  My five children voted on skydiving. Even the little one voted for skydiving, because she wanted to see if I had the guts to do it.",2012-08-06,2012-08-01-36025_1366829047597_1137781287_30989193_2663499_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-08-01-36025_1366829047597_1137781287_30989193_2663499_n.jpg,"The decision to freefall 13,000 feet out of a plane came after a family vote of ""what to do tomorrow"" while vacationing in Hawaii. My five children voted on skydiving. Even the little one, who was too young to come, voted for skydiving, because she wanted to see if I had the guts to do it.""No way,"" I replied. ""I am not jumping out of a plane.""""We voted,"" they said. ""You promised majority would rule."" They walked out of the room and sauntered off to the pool. I got on the computer and started researching the safety of skydiving.Approximately 500,000 people pretend they are birds and jump out of a plane each year, tallying up more than 3 million jumps. There were a total of 25 deaths in North America in 2011. Frankly, that's pretty good math. Clearly skydiving is safer than driving a car. Or flying commercial. However, statistics aside, it clearly isn't a sport where you want to have a bad day. My favorite skydiving sticker says, ""If at first you don't succeed, skydiving probably is not for you.""People have been using parachutes for hundreds of years. Around 1495, Leonardo DaVinci designed a wooden framed parachute right along with sketches of machines resembling modern day helicopters. During World War I, parachutes were introduced as rescue devices and the first emergency bailout from an airplane occurred in 1922. I have always felt that a parachute should come as standard gear on all commercial air transportation.We wake up the next morning to beautiful Hawaii sunshine and all chow down a bacon and eggs breakfast, which I figure is probably worse for our health then a little airborne free fall. Truth be told, I was still in complete denial that I had agreed to throw myself out of an airplane with my beloved progeny. At this point, I have the choice of letting fear paralyze me or letting it motivate me. Had I been alone I might have opted for the former, but since I am not about to let my children skydive alone I opt for motivation.After breakfast, we all head off to the skydiving school, which is basically a diminutive hut next to a minuscule airstrip. We are asked to sign a very large stack of release forms and watch a five-minute video that basically makes no sense. For first jump you have the option of hurling yourself into space from 5,000 feet, 7,000 feet or 13,000 feet. Jumping from 13,000 feet means that you get a full minute of free fall prior to another five full minutes of ""float time."" If you are going to do it, you might as well do it right. As we sat on the splintered bench under the wicked sun waiting for our turn we were able to survey the colorful shoots dropping to earth like gumdrops floating from space. Small planes taxi down the field one after another, loading up groups of smiling people who are ready and willing to defy and control their relationship to gravity.Suddenly the intercom shouts: ""Moulenes... you're up!"" We move from the rickety bench to a dirt yard where we are paired up one by one with an instructor. My coach is Raul. Very cute. Great dark curly hair. Raul doesn't speak a lot of English. I'd like to say it was his second language but it was probably his third. And, he might have started studying it that week. I'm focusing on the very cute big smile. ""Hola,"" Raul says, as he grabs my hand and leads me off to a corner of the dirt patch we are being trained on. ""We're going to have fun you and I."" I'm thinking about what a stupid idea this is and that I could be sitting by the pool reading a book about quantum mechanics. ""So,"" says the smiling boy, ""Very important things to remember when we jump: 1. Cross your hands in front of your chest 2. Lean your head back on my shoulder."" My new smiling buddy from Puerto Rico winks and crosses my arms tight across my breasts and gently tilts my head back so it settles on his collar bone. I'm not sure why but this feels very comforting and I'm suddenly aware it has probably been way too long since I've gone on a date. ""GREAT! You got it. Lets go."" We march out across an open field to a plane the size of a Geisha tuna can. There are no steps leading up to the little flying box. Someone pulls up a stepladder and we climb aboard. No seats either. Just a 10-foot plank that you sit on with your legs across either side so that people can push you along as you take turns jumping. I'm now feeling sick. What I have not shared yet with Raul is that I have a major fear of flying. I truly, deeply and passionately hate planes. Hate them! The good news regarding this point is that I figure I am going to be happier jumping out than actually flying in the stupid thing. We are suddenly in the air -- the plane of course has an open door so that you can fling yourself out, which makes the sound of the wind deafening. I turn to Raul and ask, ""What do I need to know about when we come down to earth and land?"" He laughs. ""Oh, baby, don't worry, we have five minutes on the way down, I'll tell you before we hit.""Gee, that's just super reassuring! ""So, Raul,"" I say. ""How about you tell me something really intimate about your life so I can develop some false trust in you?"" At this moment Raul is tightly strapping my parachute onto his in the tandem jumping position.""Okay baby, never let a Puerto Rican get this close behind you if you are not going skydiving!"" As the plane climbs higher and higher out over the ocean I'm now seated behind two children and in front of another and realize that I have actually made a commitment to jumping out of an airplane. I am reminded of the multiple voices from my past that have told me on recurrent occasions that I can, occasionally, be just a tad too impetuous. ""Hey everyone,"" shouts another instructor. ""When you get to the door and freak... If you scream NOOOOOO it sounds a lot like GOOOOO with the wind factor up here."" He is laughing very hard. I turn around to glance at cute Raul over my shoulder... ""I gotta be honest here, I'm feeling a BIT nervous -- kind of like puking-my-guts-out nervous.""He starts to gently rub my shoulders, leans in close and whispers, ""Relax babe, just wait until you see the view from my office. By the way, I've jumped more than 22,000 times. I was a paratrooper in the military and I promise you I'll take care of you."" He smiles that handsome smile. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I suddenly trust this man more than any male I've every met and I momentarily think I might like to marry him if I survive.People start moving down the plank. Whoosh. I see daughter one fly out the side of the plane. Whoosh. Child two doesn't even settle on the edge of the bench he is so excited to jump. I'm being moved along. I'm not really aware of any reality or where I fit in time and space. I just am. My ass is sitting on the edge of an open door and my legs are dangling over the side of the plane out in some undefined and sweeping space. I look down at the ocean wondering if I can spot a dolphin. As I ponder this I suddenly realize my ass is no longer touching anything. I'm suspended in the open air with nothing sheltering me and 13,000 feet above the earth. My arms are stretched out like wings, and I feel the wind rushed against my body and face with such force that my throat feels parched. As my body rushes through air at more than 100 miles an hour, the thought that tiptoes into my mind is a margarita would be lovely. The view of the world from above is simply spectacular. It is nothing like looking at Earth through the miniature window from inside a plane where you have to crank your neck to get a good vantage. The world below is a vast, open, full screen panorama. We turn our arms to the right and fly towards right, we lift our right arm and look left and guide ourselves across the open horizon. In flight you simply ask your body to move and it responds. Effortless. ""Want to summersault?"" Raul asks. ""Of course I do."" We lean and spin gently in a circle and take a look at the world from 360 degrees. There is never a sensation of falling, simply a feeling of flying on the thermal winds that surround you... All too quickly it's coming to an end, and Raul tells me to tuck my legs. We touch down. I have kids racing toward me yelling, ""Can we go again, can we?"" The answer is of course. Anything so simple, so easy and so empowering is worth doing as often as possible.To be continued...

The flight attendants immediately alerted the pilots and the plane was stopped in its track,"" passenger -- and Environment Department chief -- Siva Nathiran told the paper. According to News.com.au, passengers became panicked and emergency procedures were activated. The plane was delayed again along with other outbound flights.

There have been a handful of incidents in the past of passengers tampering with the plane's emergency door. In May 2011, a Delta passenger tried to open the door while the plane was in-flight to Boston. Not long after, in September, a passenger had to be subdued on a Thomson Airlines flight when he tried to open the plane's emergency doors about 45 minutes into the flight. And, there was that time in February of this year that a man opened an emergency exit to help out a mom with a crying child. "

Homier says she relies on Social Security to pay her bills and while she is confident the program will continue to help her she fears it will not be able to rely on it. ""Social Security is whatￂﾒs carrying me,"" Homier said. ""It pays all my bills."" People retiring today are part of the first generation of workers who have paid more in Social Security taxes during their careers than they will receive in benefits after they retire. Itￂﾒs a historic shift that will only get worse for future retirees, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. Previous generations got a much better bargain, mainly because payroll taxes were very low when Social Security was enacted in the 1930s and remained so for decades. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c18fa2400005100531291.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly one in two Americans -- 46 percent -- die ""with virtually no financial assets,"" or less than $10,000, according to a recent study by economics professors at MIT, Dartmouth and Harvard. In fact, 19 percent of Americans die with ""zero"" financial assets, the study found. (Hat tip: the Washington Post's Wonkblog.)The study found that many of these people with modest assets rely ""almost entirely"" on Social Security benefits to survive, own no housing property, and are in poor health. People with zero financial assets and an annuity income of less than $30,000 were in the bottom health quartile before they died, while those in households with financial assets of at least $25,000 and an annuity income of $30,000 to $40,000 were in the 43rd health percentile before they died, according to the study.Poorer Americans die younger, in part because they cannot pay for medical emergencies, according to the study. And before death, poorer Americans' quality of life is significantly lower than the quality of life of their richer counterparts.Many of these Americans who die without assets in effect outlive whatever retirement savings they may have.Most Americans do not save enough, and half of Americans are not saving at all for retirement, according to a recent study by LIMRA, a financial services trade association. Younger people are particularly unlikely to save for retirement, in part because many have less financial education, lower earnings and student loan debt.Americans need about $1 million in retirement savings to generate $40,000 per year in retirement income, according to Kiplinger. So it is best to start saving early."
