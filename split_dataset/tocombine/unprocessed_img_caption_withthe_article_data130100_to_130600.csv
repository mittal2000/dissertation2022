In many ways you were the cultural arbitrator of much of my grown up comedic tastes. The problem is the country has changed and you have not.Don't get me wrong, our friendship isn't ending because of ""diversity issues."" The truth is I don't want you to check diversity boxes with minority hires. That's great for headlines but it doesn't solve the problems plaguing your show. The real issue here is the America depicted on your show often bears little resemblance to the country we live in today.Great satire only works if the world invoked in the art looks like the world we live in. The believability of your satire has declined with your inability to accurately represent America in the totality of our cultural experience. It is distracting to me as a viewer to watch a show which purports to be representative of America yet makes no effort to incorporate the stories of broad populations of our people.The America you represent on your show looks a lot like 1975, the first year you went on air, and not like the America we live in today. In 1975 you provided cultural commentary rooted in the issues facing our country. Today you still claim to do that but the America you represent on your show does not look like our actual country.It's not that you had one black person on your show in 1975 and now you have 3; it's that the sketches involving these characters are often reductive of race rather than inclusive. The Fred Armisen recurring character Fericito with his over the top exclamations of ""Aye Dios Mio"" is mildly funny until you realize that he is a grotesque caricature of Latino culture. Newsflash: in 2014 broad racial caricatures are boring and the definition of safe comedy. You know what would be revolutionary, depicting non-white actors in a funny way which didn't resort to stereotypes.To be fair no show is doing this well right now, but SNL you are my oldest best friend, and I expect more from you. We go back, and all I am asking is for you to keep up with the times. Being inclusive would enhance the viewing experience of the general public. But then that would require you to change. Change is hard, but in refusing to change, I'm not really sure who you are anymore.When we first met I thought you were a progressive, today I'm not so sure. Your struggle to represent a more diverse country actually reminds me of a more conservative person. The Republican Party is often criticized for being out of touch with broad spectrums of new voters because their policy is written almost exclusively by white males. SNL, most of your cultural commentary is filtered through the prism of white male writers.The question facing the Republican Party is the same posed to you: can you remain relevant in an America in which your content is relevant only to increasingly small pieces of the demographic pie. The answer is no. I will give you props for hiring two new African American writers but that is not going to completely solve the problem. To remain relevant you're going to have to continue to broaden the sources with which you draw your humor from. Do you really want to continue to have such a narrow cultural focus at the expense of excluding large parts of the country?Here's the thing SNL, right now you seem trapped in a time warp, you may have updated your wardrobe but you're still acting like you did when we first met. Truth is it's all gone a bit stale and I am starting to feel insulted. The rest of the country and I have changed, we are a more diverse nation. Interacting with you I am not so sure you agree. So, sorry it's not you it's me, I can't be friends with someone who doesn't acknowledge me or my friends."

Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos took to Twitter on Friday to voice concern over the similarities between the Pharrell-produced track ""Can't Rely on You,"" by English singer Paloma Faith, and his band's 2004 hit song ""Take Me Out."" Kapranos was generally vague about his accusations, and his tone connotes lightheartedness -- even if such allegations are often the stuff of lawsuits within the music industry.This isn't the first time Pharrell has been associated with plagiarism allegations. Last year's Robin Thicke-fronted smash ""Blurred Lines"" was the subject of much dispute -- including back-and-forth lawsuits that have since been settled -- when Marvin Gaye's estate claimed the song was a ripoff of the successful 1977 release ""Got To Give It Up.""Pharrell has yet to respond to Kapranos' tweet. HuffPost Entertainment reached out to the producer's rep on Saturday and will update this post upon receiving a response. For what it's worth, it seems Kapranos was in the mood to pinpoint musical infringements last week. He drew a similar conclusion about Lorde's ""Royals"" on Monday.Listen to the two songs below and see if you agree with the comparisons.

Officials from the National Football League, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection displayed recently confiscated items while also showing phony websites that have been set-up to sell Super Bowl XLVIII merchandise. Counterfeit sports merchandise, much of which originates in China, is a multi million dollar industry.

A Broncos infant onesie on the same site sells for around $5. Too good to be true? Probably. As Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos fans gear up for Sunday's Super Bowl, it's likely that some will sport -- knowingly or unknowingly -- counterfeit jerseys, jackets, T-shirts and hats that they purchased online or in stores. But it's not just quality and the economy that may be compromised, according to experts. The phony products could also expose wearers to toxic chemicals.""People may be trying to save a buck, impress their friends, show off their team's colors,"" said Andrew Munoz, a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Seattle. ""But a lot of these pieces end up falling apart after one wash. On top of that, there are health concerns.""Federal authorities in New York City, right across the state line from New Jersey where this year's Super Bowl will be played, reported on Thursday that they have seized more than 202,000 imitation NFL items, as well as 163 websites selling knock-offs since Operation Team Player began in June. Like shipments of tainted children's shoes, jewelry and cosmetics -- the FBI released a warning about the health hazards of counterfeit makeup and fragrances in early January -- some fan products are still believed to have slipped under the radar and across the border.""Most of these counterfeits are coming from China. We don't know what conditions they are being made in. We don't know what dyes and other chemicals they're using,"" said Munoz, noting seizures of Chinese goods in the past have tested ""high in lead, cadmium and other chemicals used in these types of clothing.""But the confiscated Super Bowl items have not been tested for heavy metals or other toxic chemicals, noted Justin Cole, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman in New York. ""Children's toys are a big concern. But there's been no reason to worry and go down that route [with apparel],"" he said.Scott Wolfson, a spokesperson with the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission, agreed. ""We really haven't seen that as an area where we've actually done any enforcement or seen a need for a public announcement,"" he said.Still, other experts and advocates are taking the risk seriously. ""I don't want to make it overblown,"" said Munoz, ""but the concern is real.""In January, environmental advocacy group Greenpeace reported hazardous chemicals in children's clothes and shoes made by major brands, including Disney, Burberry and Adidas.Even though contaminants still turn up, name brands do have a market incentive to follow regulations and keep toxic chemicals out of their products. In fact, several companies, including Nike, have pledged to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their supply chains by 2020. Counterfeiters, on the other hand, don't have high standards.""They'll go for the cheapest and easiest, and that tends to be the most toxic compounds out there,"" said John Deans, an analyst for Greenpeace's Toxics Campaign.Still, he cautioned, without testing, there is no way to be sure counterfeit products are more toxic than the major brands. “Part of the problem is that in manufacturing countries like China and Indonesia, there are not many restrictions, so the whole market has the potential to be toxic,” said Deans.Plasticizers such as phthalates, which studies have found can disrupt human hormones, are often used in the synthetic fabrics and in the plastic-like ink used to put names and numbers on jerseys, Deans noted. Lead and cadmium also may be part of the mix. Mounting evidence links exposures to very low levels of lead with brain damage, reproductive disorders, cardiovascular disease and a host of other health problems. The biggest risks are faced by pregnant women and young children.Such dangers were also among those underscored in a consumer guide to fake clothing, published by the Italian Ministry for Economic Development in November 2012.""It is easy to find traces of chemical coloring agents and paints which are harmful to health,"" reads the report. ""Over time, the chemicals are gradually absorbed by the skin.""Still, the bigger health risks, according to Deans, may come through the manufacturing, care and eventual disposal of the tainted products. ""When people wash the jersey after the season's over -- because, of course, you can't wash it until the season is over -- phthalates become available in the environment,"" he said. Whether flowing out with laundry wastewater, or released from a landfill or incinerator, heavy metals and plasticizers can end up in the air, soil or water, and result in new exposure to the public.Cole said that while it's possible some confiscated Super Bowl gear could eventually be donated to charity, most of it would be destroyed. The seizures continue, and new counterfeit merchandise figures to be released next week will surpass the current total of more than $21.6 million, he said.Ultimate victory over the imitators is unlikely. Feds face an ongoing game of whack-a-mole; while they continually upgrade their fake-finding tools, criminals seem to find new ways to fool them.""Counterfeiters are getting very good at what they do,"" said Munoz.From slick web designs that mimic authentic NFL stores to the use of the official NFL hologram, both feds and consumers can be easily duped. ""Everyone knows how much these luxury goods cost. If it looks too good to be true, people should think twice before buying that jersey or T-shirt for their kids or themselves,"" Munoz advised."

Bear Republic reports keeping their ratio at less than half that in producing their 72,000 barrels a year, and that was before installing the EcoVolt.“We’ve worked hard to reduce our water use to a 3.5 to 1 ratio,” Norgrove told the North Bay Business Journal. “With EcoVolt we expect to do even better. The city of Cloverdale red-lined us at 8 million gallons of water a year, but we use less than that.”In Cloverdale, where the state’s record drought has diminished the Russian River to a mere trickle, corporate commitment to water sustainability is of high importance. The Department of Public Health named Cloverdale one of 17 communities in danger of running out water within as few as 60 days. The town has implemented mandatory water conservation and banned certain uses, though city officials have announced they think the DPH’s inclusion of Cloverdale on the list was an exaggeration.Bear Republic’s efforts to confront the water shortage aren’t new. In November of last year, the brewery struck a deal with the city and paid nearly half a million dollars for the construction of two wells Cloverdale couldn’t have otherwise afforded. They’re set to open in July, and city officials say that day can’t come soon enough. ""The whole water situation doesn't look good at all, no matter how you look at it anyway,"" Cloverdale Vice Mayor Robert Cox told the San Francisco Chronicle this week. ""The Russian River is where we get our water, and it's just about dry. There's no rain. About the only good news on the horizon is those new wells.” "

So, another question remains: will it be cold enough for beer to freeze?Frozen beer was a problem for fans of the Green Bay Packers and San Francisco '49ers during the NFC Wild Card game on Jan. 5, 2014, at Lambeau Field. The high temperature was only 12 F with a low of minus 5 F.A typical strength beer with 5 percent alcohol by volume will freeze near 26 to 29 F, according to Karl Siebert, professor of biochemistry and director of the Brewing Program at Cornell University.The time it takes for a beer to freeze depends on the starting temperature of the beer and the temperature of its surroundings, Siebert said.""I think wind would not be much of a factor,"" he said. ""It happens much faster with cans than bottles because metal conducts heat better than glass and glass has a larger thermal mass -- it's a lot thicker.Weather may play a factor in the game, but AccuWeather.com Senior Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said the odds are against another beer freeze.The high Sunday at MetLife Stadium will be in the mid-30s with a low in the mid-20s.""The cold is going to be entrenched in the Northeast,"" Rayno said. ""You won't have to worry the beer will get warm too fast.""Frozen beer isn't harmful but it could turn hazy, especially with repeated freeze/thaw cycles, Siebert said.""This is unsightly but not harmful,"" he said.Freezing could cause beer to gush out of a can or bottle when they're opened. However, cold beer is not necessarily a bad thing. The ideal beer temperature depends on the beer style and local customs, Siebert said.""In Britain, the tradition is to serve ale at room temperature in a pewter mug,"" he said. ""With lagers in the U.S., cool, or even frosty, conditions are often seen. With colder temperatures, a drinker experiences less of the flavor. I think refrigerator temperature is a good compromise."""

I addressed a great deal of those lessons here. But, as I watched my daughter tonight, learning how to put the crown back onto her head after having taken it off, I felt myself smile from deep inside. I'd watched her pull things off of her head for the better part of a year now. This was nothing new. But putting them back on? Yet another new skill kiddo is rapidly getting under her belt. And I was proud. And at that moment, I realized there's a whole other list of things that no one ever told me I'd love about being a parent:1. When your child learns a new skill, you will be as proud of them for learning how to put a pink, felt crown on their own head as you would be if they'd just cured cancer. (Clearly, not nearly as important in the grand scheme of things, but that's the point. Being a parent means becoming insanely proud of things like going pee pee on the potty)2. Your child's face will burst into pure delight from simple things like hearing and seeing the water draining from the bath tub. And this delight on your child's face will cause your heart to damn near explode from joy. 3. You will actually learn to function on no sleep. And you will stay up voluntarily at night just to hold your child a little longer and feel her breathing against your chest. You'll even wake up earlier than necessary for work in the morning so that you can manage to squeeze a snuggle session into your morning routine.4. You won't bat a short, naked eyelash at the fact that you can no longer afford your expensive makeup or skincare products because you have to pay for baby care items instead. One long whiff of your child's hair and none of it matters at all. 5. Your life will turn into a Broadway show where even going down the stairs requires a song and a dance. And these daily, impromptu performances will be the most rewarding performances of your life. 6. You will love this little person more than you have ever loved yourself. Every decision in your life going forward will revolve around your child.7. The sound of your little one's giggle is all you need to put even the worst day behind you. And a snuggle and unprompted kiss? They can wipe out a whole week of bad.8. You won't remember how you ever survived making dinner without having a kitchen dance party, singing into a wooden spoon. In your socks and pajamas. At 5:30 p.m.. And you will have so much more fun than you ever did at the club.9. You will look at your child and feel as if a piece of your heart is walking outside of your body. Because it is.Let's be honest; being a parent is hard. It is the most difficult and important task any of us will ever undertake. It is also the most rewarding. The contagious smiles, infectious laughter and the bright twinkle in my little girl's big brown eyes is more than enough to make all of the sleepless nights worthwhile. What no one ever told me about being a parent? That I would give life to a child but that child would remind me what it means to live."
