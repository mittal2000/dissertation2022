Hundreds of farmers have died.Decisions by the three governments to quarantine districts and restrict movements to contain the spread of the virus have also disrupted markets and led to food scarcity and panic buying, further pushing up prices, WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have said.""Planting and harvesting are being disrupted with implications for food supply further down the line. There is a high risk that prices will continue to increase during the coming harvest season,"" said WFP spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs.In the Liberian capital Monrovia, prices of cassava and imported rice, the main staple food, have jumped by 30 percent.Aid workers in the crowded Monrovia neighborhood of Logan Town began distributing emergency rations of rice, bulgur wheat, peas and oil to around 1,000 residents on Friday.""All our families are poor, let's be frank, so when WFP come to our rescue, along with Red Cross bringing food, they are so happy in the community,"" said Patricia Delaney, community chairperson of the neighborhood.Byrs said WFP was carrying out a food security survey remotely using mobile phones to check the impact of the crisis on 2,400 families across the three worst affected nations.In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, U.S. Major General Darryl Williams told reporters on Friday some 425 military personnel deployed to Liberia would start helping to train health workers there from next week.""We plan to train 500 a week,"" he said, adding that the United States would also increase the number of helicopters sent to remote areas of the country to help with the Ebola response. PICK-UP TRUCKSDespite repeated warnings from the World Health Organization that travel bans will only worsen the suffering of Ebola-hit countries, some U.S. lawmakers are calling for a ban on travel from West Africa.However, Air Cote d'Ivoire's Chief Executive Rene Decurey said his airline would resume flights next week to the capitals of the three worst affected countries.""It's not good to isolate these countries, because when you isolate them people will always find a way,"" he told Reuters.In another piece of positive news, the WHO said the Ebola outbreak in Senegal was officially over, though it said the country remained vulnerable to further cases of the deadly disease being imported.The first round of a survey of 800 people in Sierra Leone's eastern districts of Kailahun and Kenema showed people were worse off in terms of food security, despite being the main producing areas.""The survey showed that certain families have cut down to one meal a day or that people are eating food that costs less, such as cassava instead of rice,"" Byrs told Reuters.The WFP also began distributing food on Friday to 265,000 people in the Waterloo suburb near Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown, an area that has recorded high infection rates.""The aim of the distribution is to stabilize quarantined families by giving them enough to eat so that they do not leave their homes to look for food,"" it said in a statement.The aid, which included rice, pulses, vegetable oil and salt, should meet families' needs for one month, WFP added.The WFP said it was procuring 74 vehicles including mortuary vehicles and pick-up trucks, funded by the World Bank, to help tackle the crisis. A first batch of 30 vehicles is expected to arrive by air in Sierra Leone on Saturday.""We have enough evidence now to know that the best ambulance is not a closed ambulance, it's a pick-up. Why is it better to have a pick-up? The driver is protected. The person can be put in the back on a stretcher,"" said WHO's Isabelle Nuttall.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fd6c3c000066000d1d4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The right of education to all children is so fundamental as to be virtually uncontested within the Western world. But for many of the world's children, education is not a right, but a privilege - and one that millions of children are not afforded on the basis of their gender alone. It is only in recent years that the fight for girls' educational rights became an issue of global prominence, in large part due to the efforts of one young woman. Malala Yousafzai is a girl with a voice in a world where women remain voiceless. However, her decision to speak up against the injustices done to her and other young women was not without consequence. On October 9, 2012 Malala was riding the bus on her way home from taking an exam when a Taliban gunman boarded the vehicle and shot her in the head. Her road to recuperation would lead her to seek treatment in the United Kingdom, where she resides to this day. When the shooting occurred, Malala had been an advocate for girls' educational rights for three years and had already begun to accumulate followers on a global level for her heroism and activism. She was fourteen years old at the time. Now, only two years later, the young woman has reached a new milestone. At 17, she has become the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Prize in any category. Malala shares the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize with Indian educational and children's rights activist, Kailash Satyarthi. The Ongoing Fight for Girls' Educational Rights in PakistanIt is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement. However, the fight for educational rights is far from ended. The assassination attempt against Malala may have been the most notable such instance of this kind of violence, due in large part to her growing celebrity prior to the event, but numerous other women and girls have been violently attacked and murdered - all for the crime of trying to obtain an education. While it would be reassuring to think that these crimes occurred before the attempt against Malala's life, numerous such occurrences have taken place since. Among the most heinous of these events have been the shooting deaths of female teachers, the burning of a girls' high school, and the bombings of over a thousand schools that actively supported the rights of girls to achieve an education. The Pakistani government has assured the global community that it is taking steps to ensure the educational rights of its girls -- a right that is supported by the Constitution of the country. However, a foundation set up in Malala's honor -- one that the Pakistani government has promised to fund with $10 million -- seems to be much more of a pacification effort than an earnest attempt by the country to undo the damage done by these militants. Malala herself noted that significant lack of support for these issues in a petition written in protest of the murder of Shahnaz Nazli, one of the teachers killed in these attacks. Though funding can build schools, it cannot prevent them from being bombed or burned to the ground, and it certainly cannot prevent the deaths of those young girls seeking an education or the teachers fighting for that right. Continuing attitudes toward Malala and her activism in the country are evidence enough that the fight for girls' educational rights remains on shaky ground. Protests at a school named in Malala's honor drew over 300 individuals. Meanwhile, the young woman continues to be viciously attacked and criticized through media in the country.Pakistan has proven time and again that it is unwilling to fight for the rights of its children to attain an education. Currently, three-quarters of all girls in the country do not attend school, and this is a number that is steadily growing. Unless girls can safely go to school without threat of attack, this number will only continue to grow - and more girls who, like Malala, simply wanted an education will continue to die. The Outlook for Girls' Educational RightsThe pressing question, then, is what the future holds for girls' educational rights. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Malala, though perhaps a year late, indicates that the global community is ready to begin a real and serious discussion about what can be done to ensure that girls in Pakistan, and other countries where the suppression of women remains a pressing issue, have the opportunity to learn. Perhaps most notable about her achievement is the hope that it brings to her fellow students back home in her native Swat Valley. Though she remains a controversial figure in Pakistan at large, her achievement was celebrated by those who best understand the struggle that she went through to achieve an education. Badrai Khan, a 19-year-old college student from the region, described the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Malala as ""an achievement for all girl students of Pakistan."" One young shopkeeper discussed his pride in Malala and said that, inspired by her, he urged his father to put his sisters into school. Though small, these first steps are the clearest sign that we have of a brighter future for girls' education in the country. However, perhaps the most notable indicator of how far the country has to go is the fact that Malala Yousafzai has chosen to continue her education in England, despite being perhaps the most prominent Pakistani ambassador in the world at present. In speaking about the honor that has been given to her, Malala has stated her pride at being the first Pakistani and the first young person to achieve the award. Additionally, she has assured the world that her activism in the fight for girls' education rights is only just beginning. In a struggle where even the smallest victories must be celebrated, the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Malala Yousafzai is a triumph. Through her tremendous courage and sacrifice, awareness of the struggle for girls' educational rights has reached an all time high. And, of course, one cannot forget Malala Yousafzai's personal triumph, most poignantly expressed through the Tweet that followed the announcement that she would be the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize: ""Malala will make her first statement after school."""
2,QUEER VOICES,"Ebola, HIV, and the Politics of Contagion","Jim Downs, ContributorHistorian and Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-hiv-and-the-politic_b_6000556.html,"That Ebola now compels other Americans to consider the threat of a contagious virus suggests how fortunate they have been. Instead of sounding off an alarm of hysteria, they might just want to listen to how the other half lives.",2014-10-17,"A man in full protective gear enters a tent in the Ebola treatment unit being preventively set to host potential Ebola patients at the University Hospital of Yopougon, on October 17, 2014. Air CÃ´te d'Ivoire, the national plane company, announced on October 17 it will resume its flights to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone on Monday. Hysteria over Ebola has reached fever-pitch the world over despite repeated calls for calm.The virus has killed nearly 4,500 people, most of them in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and the disease has reared its ugly head further afield in the United States and Spain, sparking post-apocalyptic fears of mass contagion. AFP PHOTO / SIA KAMBOU (Photo credit should read SIA KAMBOU/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcf4324000051009698d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At a recent dinner party, a friend explained that she refused to travel to Paris because of the fear of Ebola. Another friend chimed in and said that he declined going to a social event because a friend of a friend had a relative who had just been to Africa. And the list goes on of people who, in some form or another, fear contracting Ebola.Throughout American history, there are dozen of cases of hysteria surrounding the apparent outbreak of an epidemic, from recent fears over Asian bird flu to fears of cholera outbreaks in the 19th century. But the question of fear needs to be contextualized, not just in terms of alleviating Americans' paranoia (as Shepherd Smith recently did on Fox News), but rather by thinking about how various populations within the nation have consistently lived under a threat of infection.For gay Americans, the very act of sex -- the most human act that leads to the creation of life -- meant death for generations of gay people. The outbreak of HIV in the early 1980s has left gay people on high alert for the last 30+ years. Many gay men continue to live with the threat of contracting an epidemic every time they engage in sex, whether it is with a lifetime partner or a one-night stand. Sex could lead to death, be it because sometimes condoms break or because someone is unaware of his status.The fear of Ebola, thus, tells us more about one's social status and, dare I say, privilege, rather than about the disease itself. For many gay men, who have lived amid HIV ""outbreak"" for the last thirty years, the threat of Ebola perhaps has not rattled them as much as their heterosexual counterparts. More to the point, when HIV broke out, the federal government did not react with the alacrity that it is today with Ebola -- in fact, they denied it. When HIV began to spread, the media did not show images of medical professionals wearing space-age hazmat suits; rather, it continued to show images of emaciated victims dying of the disease. And when HIV broke out, gay people did not have the privilege of concocting far-fetched scenarios at dinner parties in which they could potentially imagine the threat of coming in contact with an epidemic; rather, HIV had already infiltrated their communities, came into their homes, and took away their family and friends -- there was no ""what if."" The threat of Ebola provides a peek into the politics of contagion. For many gay Americans, going on a date often leads to a conversation about epidemic diseases. That Ebola now compels other Americans to consider the threat of a contagious virus suggests how fortunate they have been. Instead of sounding off an alarm of hysteria, they might just want to listen to how the other half lives.Jim Downs is currently completing More Than Just Sex: The Forgotten History of Gay Liberation (Basic Books), and is the author of Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering (Oxford U.P., 2012)"

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8da0725000094003a555d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Both the Republican and Democratic parties are raising historic sums from single donors for the 2014 midterm elections under new rules resulting from a major Supreme Court ruling in April.The Supreme Court's McCutcheon decision struck down aggregate campaign contribution limits that prevented a single donor from giving more than $123,200 to candidates, political party committees and political action committees per two-year election cycle. Sub-limits for aggregate contributions that barred donors from giving more than $48,600 to candidates and $74,600 to parties and PACs also were eliminated.This opened the door to the creation of super-sized joint fundraising committees linking multiple candidates and party committees and allowing a single donor to cut one large check to be divided among participants. These super-joint committees are just now beginning to raise these huge checks.From July through September, Targeted State Victory, a Republican Party super-joint committee linking 10 party committees, raised more than $2.3 million. This total included six checks of $100,000 or more from single donors totaling $696,200. These single checks are far in excess of the previous $74,600 maximum allowed to be given to party committees and PACs in one election cycle.The Democratic Party's Grassroots Victory Project 2014 raised more than $1.3 million over the same period. Even though Democratic politicians denounced the McCutcheon ruling as furthering the already corrosive influence of money politics, this super-joint committee relied even more on donors giving more than $100,000 than the Republican group. These donors gave $1.13 million to Grassroots Victory Project 2014. The single largest donor to either committee was Ian Simmons, a Boston-based investor married to a member of the billionaire Pritzker family, who gave $150,000 to the Democratic super-joint committee.Grassroots Victory Project 2014 is run by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and links fundraising for 11 state political parties and 14 Senate candidates with the DSCC. At this point in the campaign, it theoretically could receive a single check of $178,800 from one donor to distribute to all of the 26 committees it connects.In an email to The Huffington Post, Dan Backer, the leading lawyer who brought the McCutcheon case before the Supreme Court, simultaneously criticized the Democratic Party for taking advantage of the new landscape it claims to oppose, and dismissed it as par for the course.""Other than once again showcasing the typical Democratic combination of hypocrisy and free-riding on campaign finance free-speech issues, so what?"" Backer wrote.Critics of the McCutcheon decision said the ruling would open the door for candidates and party leaders to directly solicit these large checks from wealthy donors.Prior to the court's ruling, Fred Wertheimer, campaign finance reform advocate and head of Democracy 21, warned that the McCutcheon case would allow for the creation of these very super-joint committees and that politicians would wind up soliciting the kind of large checks the court stated in previous campaign finance cases, ""creates an inherently corrupt system."""

At least seven people in northeast Ohio are under voluntary quarantine and being monitored because they had contact with Vinson, a Texas nurse who was diagnosed with Ebola shortly after visiting the area last weekend, health officials said Thursday.

Vison, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, where Duncan was being treated and later died, flew to Cleveland on Friday to help plan her wedding. She returned to Dallas on Monday. She called health officials before her flight on Monday, reporting a minor fever. But the Center for Disease Control and Prevention told her it was okay to get on the plane.Because she may have been sick earlier than officials believed, the CDC is expanding their investigation to people the 29-year-old nurse may have come into contact with over the weekend. Included are passengers who were on her flight to Cleveland, Fox 8 Cleveland reported. Frontier has reached out to passengers on five flights that used the same airplane Vinson flew on, the Denver Post reported. Anyone who flew with her is encouraged to call 1-800-CDC INFO. A CDC spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that it was possible that passengers on Vinson's Friday flight may have contracted the virus. Earlier this week, CDC Director Tom Frieden said that because Vinson's fever was low on Monday, it is unlikely that she was contagious. Still, he said it was mistake for her to fly.Seven people have placed themselves under self-quarantine in Northeast Ohio after coming into contact with Vinson during her trip to Ohio. According to Fox News 8, people who were at the Coming Attractions bridal shop in Akron on Oct. 11 from 12 to 3:30 p.m. have been asked to call the health department. Some schools in Texas and Ohio have also canceled classes because students or staff flew on the same airplane as Vinson. Vinson is the second person in the United States to be infected with Ebola on U.S. soil. She and fellow nurse Nina Pham were infected after caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who was the first person to be diagnosed with the virus in U.S. Duncan died on October 8th.Read more from HuffPost on Ebola: The Uncensored Reality Of Covering Ebola As A Journalist All The Times The World Tried To Warn Us Why We Won't Have An Ebola Vaccine For Years The Most Destructive Ebola Myths, Debunked What Actually Happens When A Person Is Infected"

But there is risk that can be tampered down if you take the appropriate discipline and use the protocols,"" he said.The job of the up to 4,000 American forces expected to be deployed to West Africa focuses on building infrastructure, like the 25-bed field hospital for sick healthcare workers and up to 17 Ebola treatment units across the country at the center of the world's worst Ebola outbreak on record.A small number of U.S. forces are also testing blood samples in three mobile laboratories, and another four laboratories are on their way, Williams said.""That's probably the closest it comes (for the U.S. military) to the Ebola virus chain,"" Williams said, referring to the mobile laboratories.Williams' comments came the same day that President Barack Obama authorized calling up reserve forces for the Ebola fight.The vast majority of engineers, transport units, civil affairs personnel, military police and medical units are in the military reserves and the National Guard.As the U.S. military grapples with questions about future deployments, it is also readying for a potential need for medical evacuation of personnel, Williams said.A Pentagon memo seen by Reuters detailed plans to automatically evacuate U.S. military forces if they were deemed to be ""high risk"" because someone had direct contact with blood or body fluids of an Ebola patient.

As the majority, they would control when, or if, his nominees get voted out of the Judiciary Committee and whether they get confirmed on the floor.There's plenty of residual anger among Republicans over Democrats changing filibuster rules last year, and that anger could well translate into payback. In response to GOP obstruction of Obama's D.C. Circuit Court nominees, Democrats changed the Senate rules last fall so it only takes a simple majority, instead of 60 votes, to advance most nominees. The effect has been Democrats confirming piles of Obama's judicial nominees, with Republicans fuming about being cut out of the process.Republicans have so far retaliated by using procedural maneuvers to delay votes on nearly every nominee. But they've also warned that Democrats will rue their decision once they end up in the minority.""I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you’ll regret this,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said as Democrats pushed through the change in rules. ""And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.""It's unclear whether McConnell would keep the change in place if he became majority leader, but that doesn't matter much while Obama is in office. The real question for the next two years is whether Republicans would be willing to play ball with the White House in agreeing to judicial nominees. And if the GOP controls the Senate, for the first time under Obama, it would have real leverage.""If Republicans control the committee and the floor, it makes sense for a Democrat president to meet them in the middle,"" said a Senate GOP leadership aide. ""This is something that [Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)] demanded for a Republican president with a Democrat majority.""Some observers are already predicting a nominations crisis if Republicans win the Senate. Norm Ornstein, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said he expects approximately zero judges would get confirmed for the rest of Obama's term.The White House doesn't view the situation as quite so dire. Neil Eggleston, the president's counsel and point person for advancing judicial nominations, says he's got a great working relationship with Republicans, and that in the event that they win control of the Senate, he doesn't expect a standstill on nominations. Even now, he said, there are productive talks underway with Republicans to line up nominees for empty court seats.""I predict a lot of progress between now and the lame duck,"" Eggleston told The Huffington Post last month.The biggest challenge for Obama is getting Republican senators to put forward nominees that he can support. There are currently 16 vacancies without nominees in states with two GOP senators, according to Alliance For Justice data, compared to eight vacancies without nominees in states with one GOP and one Democratic senator. There are just four vacancies without nominees in states with two Democratic senators.Nominees must be signed off on by the White House and home-state senators, so it's not surprising that states with two Republican senators have the most vacancies without nominees. In some cases, senators may not like Obama's proposed picks, or vice versa. In other cases, senators may be trying to hold off on filling empty court seats until a Republican is in the White House. These are lifetime appointments, after all.But the White House has struck some significant nominations deals with Republicans this year, in spite of the polarized climate on Capitol Hill. The Senate confirmed several nominees to fill emergency judicial vacancies in Arizona, which has two Republican senators, and in Florida, which has one. Just last month, Obama nominated seven district court nominees in states including Texas, North Carolina and Utah -- all states with at least one GOP senator.One strategy the White House has used with Republicans -- and one that may become more common if the GOP wins the Senate -- is cutting a deal on a package of nominees that includes some Republican picks and some Democratic picks. That approach worked for advancing Pennsylvania nominees, and has mostly worked for advancing Georgia nominees. Democrats appear to have torpedoed one nominee in the Georgia package, Michael Boggs,, but the other nominees have moved forward. Notably, the White House continues to defend Boggs against Democratic critics, a sign to other Republican senators that Obama will uphold whatever deals he cuts on nominees.Of course, if Democrats keep the Senate, the president still faces obstacles. Obama would be able to move his judicial picks more quickly through the process, but he needs Republicans to work with him more than ever to come up with new nominees. Democrats cleared so many judicial nominees in the last year that the Senate practically ran out of people to confirm. In total, the president is tasked with filling 60 district and circuit court vacancies.Regardless of whether they keep their majority, Democratic leaders are planning a big push on judicial nominations in the lame duck session. Sixteen district court nominees are currently waiting for a floor vote, and 18 are waiting for a committee vote (though one of those is Boggs). Nominations that don't get confirmed in the lame duck will expire and be returned to the president at the end of the year. ""Judicial nominations will be a high priority,"" said a top Senate Democratic aide."
