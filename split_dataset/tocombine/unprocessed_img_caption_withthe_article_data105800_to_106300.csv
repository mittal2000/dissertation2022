0,POLITICS,California Raids Destroy Sick Kids' Medical Marijuana Supply,Carly Schwartz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-marijuana-raid_n_6064798.html,,2014-11-03,"In this photo taken May 13, 2009 marijuana grown for medical purposes is shown inside a greenhouse at a farm in Potter Valley, Calif. In the mountain forests along California's North Coast, refugees from San Francisco's Summer of Love have spent four decades hiding from the law as they tended some of the world's most fabled marijuana gardens. After all those years, several statewide efforts to legalize marijuana could finally let those growers come out into the light. But at a community meeting in the heart of Northern California pot country on Tuesday, many growers said they were more worried about the cost of legalization to their bottom lines than about any federal raid. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6916ae230000be15de09b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A spate of recent raids in California has destroyed an abundance of medical marijuana plants intended to treat children with debilitating seizure disorders. Two weeks ago, a local narcotics task force raided a collective in the San Diego area, and similar agencies destroyed private farms farther north, in Mendocino and Modesto, in August. All the individuals targeted maintain they were operating within the confines of state law, and each was cultivating a supply that would be turned into medicine for children.""It's devastating,"" Joe, a Modesto-area resident whose 18-month-old son, Joey, suffers from a chronic condition that can lead to more than a hundred seizures per day, told The Huffington Post. ""This has saved my son's life. Now what are we supposed to do?"" Joe, who wouldn't give his full name for fear of further prosecution from the county, says Joey has been seizure-free since he began taking cannabis oil two months ago. His supplier, Steve Boski, had also been growing medical marijuana for HIV and cancer patients before local authorities intervened in August. Now, Joe's family only has a 90-day supply left and limited resources with which to procure more. Joe's son has found relief with a kind of cannabis that has successfully treated hundreds of other children with similar ailments. The particular strain is rich in CBD, a compound that doesn't cause users to feel ""high,"" and low in THC, which causes the drug's psychoactive effects. Marijuana's efficacy in treating various forms of epilepsy has been in the spotlight in recent months, as more families with sick children continue to come forward and more states, including conservative-leaning places like Florida and Georgia, explore adopting laws that allow for CBD-rich cannabis to be used as treatment. Earlier this year, British drug company G.W. Pharmaceuticals began clinical trials of a cannabis-based pill, Epidiolex, on children with certain severe epileptic conditions, and doctors say they are ""very encouraged"" by the preliminary results. ""It's amazing; it's completely remarkable,"" Dr. Margaret Gedde, a Colorado-based doctor who has successfully treated epileptic kids with CBD-rich marijuana, told HuffPost earlier this year. ""It does stop seizures. It doesn't hurt them.""Susan Schindler, a Mendocino-based farmer and breast cancer survivor, began growing rare CBD strains of marijuana on her property five years ago for that very purpose. Each year, she plans to give away a large majority of her supply free of charge to families with epileptic children, as well as to adult patients with Parkinson's disease, ALS syndrome and various forms of cancer.""She had entire plots dedicated to children,"" Tisha Siler, who runs a medical marijuana collective called Cannacea that gets much of its supply from Schindler and works with more than 600 families of children with severe epilepsy, told HuffPost. ""You could smoke the whole plant and never feel it, ever.""Although Schindler's growing operation adhered to California's medical marijuana law -- 25 clearly labeled plots -- she returned home on the afternoon of Aug. 5 to find her entire farm destroyed. Neighbors told her it had been raided by a group of unidentified men in camouflage uniforms who descended onto her property from helicopters and began cutting down her plants without a warrant. ""I was a mess. I'm 68 years old, and it was one of the most traumatic events of my life,"" she told HuffPost. ""They didn't kill my plants; they killed patients' ability to get better. I could have helped so many people.""Schindler said that for weeks, no official organization was willing to take responsibility for the episode. An SF Weekly investigation in September found that the raid was likely conducted by County of Mendocino Marijuana Eradication Taskforce, which is controlled by the county sheriff's office and receives funding from a mishmash of state, local and federal sources. The group, along with other narcotics enforcement agencies, has allegedly conducted several similar raids on both state-legal and illegal marijuana farms throughout Northern California this fall.A spokesperson for the Mendocino County Sheriff did not return HuffPost's repeated requests for comment.Although California became the first state to legalize cannabis for medicinal purposes when voters passed the landmark Proposition 215 in 1996, the drug remains illegal under federal law, a fact authorities used to justify a renewed crackdown on medical marijuana operations throughout the state in 2011. Two years later, the Justice Department explicitly said it wouldn't go after dispensaries and growers that adhered to a clear set of guidelines, but raids by both local and federal authorities have continued, even on businesses that clearly meet the parameters.""My growing was compliant with California state law,"" Marcus Boyd, whose San Diego collective was raided two weeks ago by a local narcotics task force, told HuffPost. Boyd added that he had been cultivating a specific strain of CBD cannabis for a local couple whose child suffered from daily seizures. ""They're back to square one, when they thought they had a light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said.Employees from Farmacy, a well-known Los Angeles dispensary that was raided by the DEA last week despite its reported compliance with state law, would not respond to HuffPost's inquiry as to whether they had been selling CBD-grade marijuana to families with sick children.Catherine Jacobson, the director of research at the Epilepsy Foundation, said the recent raids underscore the federal government's urgent need to recognize the medicinal value of cannabis. Jacobson's 5-year-old son, Ben, was born with a brain malformation and has been suffering from daily seizures since he was 14 weeks old. She planned to use some of Schindler's supply for his treatment once it harvestedThe lack of federally regulated studies of cannabis, Jacobson argued, limits doctors' and scientists' understanding of the full medical benefits of the plant, resulting instead in a trial-and-error attitude towards treatment. ""You can find publications from the '70s and '80s that show pure cannabidiol is an anti-convulsant, and here we are 40 years later and we still don't have any new information about this,"" she told HuffPost. ""That's a direct failure of the federal government. Policy decisions have gotten in the way of science, and now we can't do the research we need.""Though a clear motive behind the recent raids has yet to emerge, Schindler suspects the country's growing support for legalizing marijuana has stoked the fears of agencies tasked with defending pot's illegal status. A recent poll showed 88 percent of Americans think patients should be allowed to use cannabis for medical purposes, and multiple surveys over the past year have revealed a clear majority of respondents back recreational marijuana as well.""I think the purpose may have been to strike terror in the growers,"" Schindler said. ""We're perched at a tipping point. On one side of that wall are law enforcement agents, and they're acting exactly like a defeated, retreating army. What do they do? They burn; they pillage; they destroy everything in their wake. These people will only get more angry as they lose their funding, as their jobs are on the table."" Siler added that Mendocino County and the adjacent areas that comprise Northern California's ""Emerald Triangle,"" which produces much of the state's marijuana supply due to its ideal growing conditions, have seen a major uptick in raids this year. ""There's some kind of wave of movement here where they're acting very hostile to the culture that has risen,"" she said. During the incident at Boyd's property, one of the agents sported a t-shirt that read ""F*** the growers...Marijuana is still illegal.""The crackdown has already backfired in nearby Lake County, where a federal judge ordered authorities to stop raiding medical marijuana operations unless they explicitly have a warrant. Last week, a coalition of patients whose cannabis supply was seized in the Lake County raids sued for $600,000 in monetary damages.Schindler said that she and a handful of other growers recently hired an attorney who has requested information from both the Mendocino Sheriff's Department and the Department of Justice to determine the legality of the raids. Their next steps, she said, will be determined by what their lawyer uncovers.In the meantime, Siler, Boyd and other suppliers have no choice but to notify families that they may run out of the only remedy that helps their sick children. ""I've had to make a lot of phone calls,"" Siler said. ""It breaks my heart to tell them that they no longer have this option."""

Eid al-Fitr also known Feast of Breaking the Fast, is religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.

Americans have a tendency to overstate the number of Muslims living in the United States -- and at least 13 other countries are dealing with the same misconception.Only 1% of America’s more than 319 million residents are Muslim, according to the research group Ipsos MORI. But during a recent global survey, Americans told researchers that the Muslim population is 15 times greater than it really is. On the other hand, Americans grossly underestimated the number of Christians living in the country -- with an average guessing around 56% when the true figure is closer to 78%.The countries that fared the worse at accurately guessing the number of Muslims within their borders were France and Belgium, both of which guessed 23 percentage points too high.Japan did the best, falling only 4 percentage points away from the truth.While the figures only represent guesses, the research group’s managing director Bobby Duffy said that these misperceptions may have a real impact on policy-making. “We are sending a message about what’s worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers,” Duffy told the Guardian. Edgar Hopida, communications director for the Islamic Society of North America, says the Muslim community is feeling the ramifications of these misconceptions very deeply -- with some politicians trying to pass anti-Sharia laws and police departments expanding surveillance on Muslim organizations.Hopida blamed the ""Islamaphobia industry.""“There are segments of the community that fear that Muslims are taking over,” Hopida told The Huffington Post. “We need to dial down on the rhetoric and dial down on hysteria.”Along with the questions about faith, the researchers also asked participants to guess at percentages of immigrants, murders, teenage pregnancies, and a number of other factors.The United States actually came in as the second most ignorant country on Ipsos MORI’s “Index of Ignorance,” following Italy which came out on top. Swedes managed to guess the most accurately.  The Ipsos MORI survey used an online panel to survey 11,527 people between August 12 and August 26, including more than 1,000 adults in the United States."

Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, and its surrounding areas, has been under assault by extremists of the Islamic State group since mid-September and is being defended by Kurdish fighters. (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14091230000320093e20e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mariam Karouny and Omer BerberogluBEIRUT/MURSITPINAR, Turkey, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish fighters have joined the fight against Islamic State militants in Kobani, hoping their support for fellow Kurds backed by U.S.-led air strikes will keep the ultra-hardline group from seizing the Syrian border town.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the civil war, said heavy clashes erupted in Kobani and that both sides had suffered casualties, while the U.S. military said it had launched more air raids on Islamic State over the weekend.Idriss Nassan, deputy minister for foreign affairs in Kobani district, said Iraqi Kurds using long-range artillery had joined the battle on Saturday night against Islamic State, which holds parts of Syria and Iraq as part of an ambition to redraw the map of the Middle East.""The peshmerga joined the battle late yesterday and it made a big difference with their artillery. It is proper artillery,"" he told Reuters.""We didn't have artillery we were using mortars and other locally made weapons. So this is a good thing.""Nassan did not elaborate and it was not immediately possible to verify that progress against Islamic State had been made.The arrival of the 150 Iraqi fighters -- known as peshmerga or ""those who confront death"" -- marks the first time Turkey has allowed troops from outside Syria to reinforce Syrian Kurds, who have been defending Kobani for more than 40 days. ALL EYES ON KOBANI""They are supporting the YPG. They have a range of semi-heavy weapons,"" said Jabbar Yawar, secretary general of the peshmerga ministry in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq, referring to the main Syrian Kurdish armed group.Eyewitnesses in the Mursitpinar area on the Turkish side of the border from Kobani said two rockets were fired on Saturday night.A Reuters witness said fighting on Sunday was heavier than in the last two days, noting a strike in the late morning and the sound of three explosions.Attention has focused on Kobani, seen as key test of the effectiveness of American air strikes, and of whether combined Kurdish forces can fend off Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot made up of Arabs and foreign fighters.Air strikes have helped to foil several attempts by Islamic State, notorious for its beheading of hostages and opponents, to take over Kobani.But they have done little to stop its advances, in particular in Sunni areas of western Iraq, where it has been executing hundreds of members of a tribe that resisted its territorial gains.In their latest air strikes, U.S. military forces staged seven attacks on Islamic State targets in Syria on Saturday and Sunday and were joined by allies in two more attacks in Iraq, the U.S. Central Command said.In the Kobani area, five strikes hit five small Islamic State units, while two strikes near Dayr Az Zawr 150 miles (240 km) to the southeast in Syria destroyed an Islamic State tank and vehicle shelters.U.S. and partner nations hit small Islamic State units near the Iraqi cities of Baiji, north of Baghdad, and Falluja, in Anbar province to the west of the capital.The ultra-hardline Islamic State regards Iraq's majoriy Shi'ites as infidels who deserve to be killed.The group is expected to try and deploy suicide bombers to inflict mass casualties as Shi'ites prepare for the religious festival of Ashura, an event that has been marred by sectarian bloodshed in the past.Two car bombs killed a total of 20 Shi'ite pilgrims in different parts of Baghdad on Sunday, police and medics said.Shi'ite militias and Kurdish peshmerga fighters stepped in to try and fill a security vacuum after U.S,-funded Iraqi military forces crumbled in the face of an Islamic State onslaught in the north in June.Islamic State inflicted humiliating defeats on the Kurds.While the Kurds have retaken some territory with the support of U.S. air strikes in the north, Islamic State faces limited resistance in Iraq's western Anbar province, where its militants last week executed over 300 hundred members of the Albu Nimr tribe because it had defied the group for weeks.In the first official confirmation of the scale of the massacre, the Iraqi government said Islamic State had killed 322 members of the tribe, including dozens of women and children whose bodies were dumped in a well.The systematic killings, which one tribal leader said were continuing on Sunday, marked some of the worst bloodshed in Iraq since the Sunni militants swept through the north in June.The Albu Nimr, also Sunni, had put up fierce resistance against Islamic State for weeks but finally ran low on ammunition, food and fuel last week as Islamic State fighters closed in on their village at Zauiyat Albu Nimr.""The number of people killed by Islamic State from Albu Nimr tribe is 322. The bodies of 50 women and children have also been discovered dumped in a well,"" Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said.Since Islamic State declared a ""caliphate"" in large areas of Syria and Iraq in June, the militants have lost hundreds if not thousands of fighters in battles against other Sunni rebels, Islamist groups, forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and in U.S.-led air strikes.Fighters inside the group say that it receives hundreds of volunteers every month, which helps it carry our more attacks. It also received pledges of allegiances from Islamist groups in places such as Pakistan, Africa and some Arab states. (Writing by Michael Georgy; editing by Giles Elgood and Philippa Fletcher)"

Don't forget to visit the original Knight Bus or the flying car, and enjoy a drink of butter beer.Many of the famous scenes from those films were shot on location and further north in Northumberland is the location of one of the most iconic scenes of all - where Harry discovered the pleasures of flying a broomstick and playing Quidditch.

10,POLITICS,Antidote to Citizens United,"Dianne Collins, ContributorOriginal thinker, media personality, creator of QuantumThink",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/antidote-to-citizens-unit_b_6084766.html,"Remember when politicians wanted more than anything to do what was right for the good of all people beyond their own personal power agendas, and Supreme Court justices were able to think fairly beyond partisan biases? Hmmm ... yeah, right, neither do I.",2014-11-02,2014-10-31-NewWorldViewOldWorldViewfromQT21Site.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-31-NewWorldViewOldWorldViewfromQT21Site-thumb.jpg,"   Remember when politicians wanted more than anything to do what was right for the good of all people beyond their own personal power agendas, and Supreme Court justices were able to think fairly beyond partisan biases? Hmmm ... yeah, right, neither do I.As much as I would like to see the abolishing of the 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United ruling that can sensibly be considered an aberration of the first amendment, the outcome of which has appalled Americans and others at the vulgarity and national embarrassment of millions and billions of dollars thrown at candidates and political campaigns with the express goal of maintaining iron-fisted rule -- I also realize that there is a sure-cure antidote to the craziness of it. The antidote? Discernment. Your very own unadulterated, clear discernment and judge of character and wisdom to think for yourself beyond cultural conditioning and party rhetoric, and fear mongering. I call this Awakened Thinking. Awakened Thinking allows for discernment that goes beyond the automatic ""programming"" à la Pavlovian stimulus-response behavioral conditioning - the mechanical ""un-thinking"" thought pattern of believing everything you see and hear in low-level attack ads that express the basest condition of what can tenuously be called human. Does anyone really believe the tripe that is put into these ads? Even the actual facts of incumbents' voting records must be seen in the context of the entirety of the legislation put forth in order to glean why they voted for or against a bill. In a digital age when anybody can say anything under the guise of author-ship, ""facts"" on the face of them are no longer to be trusted, and the election comes down to a handful of independent voters -- (AKA people who can't make up their mind even after umpteen debates) in a few gerrymandered districts - it's time we discover something genuine within ourselves to renew our enthusiasm for an effective electoral process.Fortunately, vis-à-vis Citizens United we have evidence that throwing money at a candidate is not a foolproof path to success. Witness the reported $150 million Las Vegas casino billionaire flung at candidates to defeat President Obama's 2012 presidential re-election bid. Obviously, all that money didn't work. That's the good news for all of us. Break out the anti-dote! Discernment works.Toda,y thinking people want authenticity. We're demanding it. The iconic image comes to mind of actor Peter Finch imploring people to stand up and yell from their window, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" in the 1976 Warner Bros movie, Network. We want leaders who actually exhibit high moral character and ethics that recognize that we are all in this world and in this country together. And to paraphrase a rather common-sense yet profound statement of the late great design scientist Buckminster Fuller, if we're going to make it on spaceship Earth, it has to be all of us or none of us. If you want this you have to use the antidote. I say, skip the ""mad as hell"" approach. For best results, engage your own natural faculties of mind.Awakened Thinking means activating the natural faculties of your very own mind. So, how do we get to a state of mind to free ourselves of automatic conditioning that renders us sleepwalkers in the political process, under the illusion that we are awake?Activate the antidote: discernment. Engage your natural faculties of mind, like so.Mind Faculty #1 IntentWhen you view a candidate and his/her positions, ask yourself, what is their intent? Is the candidate actually thoughtful or merely parroting poll-tested sound bites? Does the candidate appear to actually be standing for something or strategically spouting the ""desire du jour"" of what campaign strategists think swing voters want?Mind Faculty #2 IntuitionUse you Intuition. This is access to intelligence that is direct apprehension of knowledge that cuts through superficialities and appearances. All great geniuses, admired leaders and true humanitarians are known for engaging their Intuitive Faculty of mind.With ballots written in ""code"" to manipulate the sway of votes and political talking points about as far from authenticity as you can get, it is up to you and me and every one of us, whether you vote or not, to start thinking for yourself beyond the obvious. Activate your Intuition.  Mind Faculty #3 Subtle EnergyAttune yourself to the Subtle Energy field of the candidate and of his/her campaign tactics. When a candidate thoughtlessly delivers a speech to ""insiders"" that later gets exposed and thrashed about on the Twittersphere, what does this say about their ability to effectively manage their campaign, let alone an entire country?It is known in science that every body is comprised of and emanates Subtle Energy. This is something we tune into every time we enter a room of people and sense they are disgruntled or they are happy, authentic or unauthentic - before we even hear a word spoken. This is you Subtle Energy Faculty of mind in gear. Use it as you tune in to the bigger picture of a campaign.Mind Faculty #4 Resonance Resonance is easy to discern. You resonate with what a candidate stands for, or you don't. The Resonance Faculty of mind is paradoxical. You know something and you don't know how you know it. You just know it. A candidate emanates who they are. Use your faculty of Resonance to know it.Whether you are a registered USA voter or not, you are likely engaging in conversations about politics and policies. Ask yourself as you speak and as you listen to others, what is the Resonance of the conversation? Does it feel ""right"" or not?Mind Faculty # 5 MeditationMeditation is not only a practice of sitting focused crossed legs and eyes closed. The Meditative Faculty is a natural aspect of mind. It enables us to experience being centered, to think clearly, focus and make wise choices because it is the state of clearing the static on the radio of your being. The signal strength is clear and you can tap into your own wisdom channel - beyond the noise of the culture, the media, the candidates. Engaging your Meditative Faculty of mind - awareness, clarity of mind, purity of being - is essential for using the antidote. Wise discernment can only come from Awakened Thinking. Who knows ... maybe when voters start waking up, politicians will, too. So please do get out and vote, and be sure to bring the antidote. <>Photo credits:  American Flag (c) 2012 Dianne Collins (the author's personal photo) New World / Old World (c) 2009 Warren Cardinal, Lucid Crew"
