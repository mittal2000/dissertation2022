If the thought of taking a risk makes you want to vomit, skip to RISK #5. Otherwise, pick a risk and report back to me with your results.CHOOSE YOUR RISK: Risk #1: Contact someone from your DISTANT past  Go back in time and think about the one that got away. Find him. Track her down. Use your NSA-inspired skills to locate this person of interest. Search Google (use quotes around the name), Bing, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram. You can even go to BeenVerified.com. This database combs through all public records. When you locate your target, send him or her a note. Keep it short and sweet. Wish this person a happy Valentine's Day. Nervous? Good. Risk #2: Contact someone from your RECENT pastGo back a few months or years. Think about that special someone who still intrigues you. It could be a prospect you stopped pursuing or someone who stopped pursuing you. It could be a connection that ended one date too soon, a relationship that didn't happen because of bad timing, or an ex that you shouldn't have let get away. Track her down. Send him a short and simple note. Wish this person a happy Valentine's Day. Wait. I hear you making excuses already. STOP! What's the worst things that will happen? Note: If you're prohibited by law from contacting this person, move on. Risk #3: Contact someone in your EVERYDAY life Expose yourself to that secret crush. Instead of getting naked, show your emotional card. Offer a gesture and share your feelings for a classmate, coworker, friend, or familiar stranger. Show this person you are thinking about him or her on Valentine's Day. Your gesture can include a rose, a card, candy, or a thoughtful conversation. Ask him what he's doing for Valentine's Day. Show her that you're interested in her personal life. Make it easy without being easy. Who knows? It might turn into a last minute Valentine's get together. Risk #4: Make it easy for people to FIND YOU on Valentine's DayPut yourself in places where other interesting, attractive, and dynamic singles can find you and participate in your awesomeness. Go to a dinner for single people, a Valentine's dance, a party, or sign up for a new or different online dating site. There are thousands of people at this very moment who want to meet you, date you, and love you. If you're hiding in your room eating ice cream and watching Valentine's porn (is there such a thing?), you're guaranteed to find no one. At the very least, organize a dinner with friends and encourage everyone to invite their cute and single friends to come along. Your job is to make it easy for people who crave love to find you. Risk #5: Put on your thong and start training TODAYIf you can't say what you think and do what you feel this Valentine's Day, put on your metaphorical thong and look in the mirror. Figure out why it's so hard for you to take a risk. When you look in the mirror, put on your physical thong, emotional thong, and spiritual thong (and be sure to lock the door). Reflect and discover why you can't take risks and be vulnerable. Are you afraid you're not attractive enough (physical thong)? Is it because you're not good enough (emotional thong)? Or could it be that you're not interesting enough (spiritual thong)? Once you identify what's hanging out of your thong, commit to changing what you don't love and work to tolerate what you can't change. Find people who can support, guide, and help you make these changes. Work to get comfortable with the uncomfortable so you can take risks and find love in time for Valentine's Day 2015 (or sooner)!

3,MONEY,What to Know Before You Invest in Startups,"Bill Clark, Contributor
President and Founder, MicroVentures",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-to-know-before-you-i_us_5b9ddd82e4b03a1dcc8dea19,"Depending on certain factors, it could be a great idea to put some portion of your portfolio into high risk assets like startups. But before you do, there are three major factors you need to consider to make sure start-up investing is appropriate for you.",2014-02-13,"'Have No Regrets' --Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dbc28240000320053b4ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The last decade has seen the rise of the startup, both in the financial and popular press. We all know the success stories; Uber, AirBnB, Twitter, and others have gone from nothing to multi-billion dollar valuations in extremely short periods. And they were funded, in part, by angel investors who gained immensely from their success. Because of this attention, and with new regulations like the JOBS Act and the rise of platforms, like MicroVentures, that facilitate equity crowdfunding and angel investing online, more people than ever are thinking about investing in startups. While startup investing is risky, it also provides the possibility for outsized returns (anywhere from five to 100 times your initial investment) when compared to other asset classes. Depending on certain factors, it could be a great idea to put some portion of your portfolio into high risk assets like startups. But before you do, there are three major factors you need to consider to make sure start-up investing is appropriate for you.1) Risk: What is your risk tolerance? Can you afford to lose your money?Public markets are diverse so it is relatively easier to find investment vehicles that match your risk tolerance. You can invest in bonds, treasuries, blue chip companies with long histories and other more stable investments and possibly alongside IPOs and other companies that are more speculative. Startups are a whole different breed. The winners tend to win big, but most fail. And when they fail, you almost never get any money back. It's gone, along with the company. Before you think about getting into this kind of investing, you must ask some questions: Are you a conservative investor? Do you want to minimize risk and see some kind of underlying asset backing an investment? Or are you the type of person who's willing to take risks and lose it all? If you're on the conservative end of the spectrum, startup investing is NOT for you. Startup investing is only right for people who want to take big risks (and potentially lose all their money) in exchange for the low probability of huge rewards. This being said, even though startups require a high risk tolerance, you can mitigate some of the risk inherent to investing in early stage companies. Early stage companies with just an idea carry the biggest risk. However, you can also find companies that have both an idea and a prototype (or something else tangible that you can see) and even a company with traction with a clear path to revenue, or a seasoned executive team with a history of finding ways to generate business. The other way to mitigate risk is by not investing all your money in one company. You can spread it around, aka diversification. Ron Conway used a method that outsider used to refer to a ""spray and pray"" that's still popular today. He would invest in hundreds of early stage companies and then make followon investments in the ones that began to gain traction. He didn't just invest in every startup that came his way though. He made intelligent decisions based on factors including how unique the idea was and if the team in place could execute on that idea. You may not have the level of sophistication and network that Ron Conway has, but with the rise of crowdfunding and angel investing platforms, building your own venture capital portfolio is now truly possible. Before the rise of platforms like MicroVentures and Angellist, investing in startups required a large upfront commitment of capital. With $50K, you could only invest in one or two companies as a typical ""angel."" Since these online platforms allow companies to more easily raise money from larger groups of people, you can now invest in ten or more companies with that same $50K of available capital.  When three out of four startups are destined to fail, you want to put your money into as many different companies as possible to maximize your chances of success. This ability to diversify your risk across multiple startups is unique to these platforms, and can't be replicated by just investing in small businesses your friends start. The great thing about angel investing is that one or two winners could pay off all of your other investments and then some. With a portfolio of only two or three investments, the likelihood of finding these big winners drops significantly.2. Time: Do you need access to your money? When?Startups are much less liquid than other types of investments. Generally, the only way you're going to see a return on your investment is after the company has a liquidity event or exit. To understand how long that might take, you need to understand the exit strategy of the startup in which you're investing. Do the founders want to go for an IPO? That could take 10 to 15 years. Do they want to build traction and get acquired by a bigger company? Or do they want to keep the company private and run it themselves for a long period of time. Not only do you need to understand what kind of exit the startup's team wants but also whether that strategy is actually feasible. If the startup wants to be acquired, are there companies out there for whom it makes strategic sense to make the acquisition? Even if a startup looks like a good acquisition candidate, the larger company may choose to just rip them off. Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion dollars, but when it came to dealing with the threat from Snapchat, Facebook decided to build their own version called Poke. All of this comes back to the question of when you would like to see a return on your money. Is it two to three years or seven plus years? If you need money in the two to three year range, you need to look at late-stage companies on the secondary market that are in the pre-IPO phase. We saw investors generate returns investing in Yelp, Facebook, and Twitter on our platform during their run-ups to IPO. If you look around right now, there are several more opportunities available that could repeat that success: Uber, airbnb, Box and Dropbox to name a few (you can look at some of these types of investments on our site if you'd like to get a sense for what they look like).But generally speaking, the only money you should invest in startups is money that you don't need to use for another purpose for at least the next five to seven years, and ideally 10+. If you need your money to produce significant returns within a short timeframe, with low risk, you shouldn't be investing in startups at all. 3. Expertise: Do you have the business experience to evaluate companies and markets?The best startup investors apply their own operational business experiences to make the best investment choices. The more time you've spent in a startup or running your own business or even working for an existing company, the better you will understand the aspects of business a startup needs to master. You will also be better equipped to identify whether the startup is, in fact, mastering them. If you are a more cautious investor who needs more data points before making an investment decision, it might make sense to begin only with startups in industries where you have worked the longest or spent the most time. If you're someone who works at Google or Apple or even does independent mobile software development you probably understand that specific space better than most other people. You know what goes into acquiring new customers, what customers look for, how to build apps, and understand both the mechanics and levels of competition in an app store. When dealing with an industry you understand, it's much easier to answer questions like: Does this company have a good idea that can actually work? Do they have a business plan that makes sense? And does the team have the necessary skills and experience to execute on that plan? However, if you're looking at a company that's outside your wheelhouse, maybe some sort of medical technology company, you probably don't know how to assess it accurately. The idea may sound amazing and have world changing potential, but without the background to truly analyze the market it is very hard to do an accurate risk assessment. This doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in those types of companies though. If you have properly diversified investments in multiple startups, strategically you should be able to handle the risk by putting less money into these types of companies and more into the startups from industries you understand.If you think you're the type of person with the means and ability to invest in startups, this is only the beginning of your journey. There's still plenty more to consider. Ultimately, investing in startups can be overwhelming for new investors. Besides offering risky bets on companies, many platforms make the situation worse by offering little or no guidance for investors. They might have exciting offerings -- but that excitement can mask potentially unsound deals. On the other hand, typical discount brokerages are not able to give their investors access to exciting and lucrative opportunities like Facebook or Twitter until those deals are available to all investors via an IPO. This space is going to change a lot in the future. If you've got the right appetite for risk, for playing the long game and bring domain expertise to the table, then startup investing could be worth exploring."

The U.S. figure skater, citing the difficulty he had at the last Olympic Games, brought his own mattress to Russia.His hopes were that the queen-sized air mattress would limit the tossing and turning he did off the ice in Vancouver. ""For the two and a half weeks I was in Vancouver I didn't sleep one full night because I was always afraid that I was going to roll off the bed,"" he told NBCOlympics.com.But now, the 28 year old has taken things a step further: He's left the Olympic village.""I had to step away and think, 'All right, I have a whole week and a half to really live this experience,'"" he said in another NBCOlympics.com interview. ""I came here to do a job and I have to stick to my business.""""I felt like I was a little off by staying in the village,” he said. ""For me, it was about realizing that I was much more mentally strong than I've given myself credit for.""He stressed the importance of that mental toughness in a recent interview with the New York Times. ""All of the work has been done physically,"" he said. ""Once you're out there, it's all about the mental game.""Abbott is smart to prioritize sleep in his quest for Olympic hardware. Even just one extra hour of shuteye has a significant positive impact on not just recovery from the previous day's activities but on future performance.""Sleep is food for the brain, sleep is fuel for exercise,"" James B. Maas, Ph.D. co-author of Sleep To Win! said in a 2013 HuffPost Live appearance. ""Sleep is simply not valued in our 24/7 society. We treat it as a luxury and it's a necessity. If you sleep longer and better, you can be a better athlete overnight.""It may be paying off. Despite taking a hard fall in Thursday night's short program, he finished the routine and earned a 72.58, putting him in the lead after 12 skaters, USA Today reported."
5,WELLNESS,Warning Labels Required For Sugary Drinks Under Proposed California Bill,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warning-labels-sugary-drinks-california_us_5b9dddaae4b03a1dcc8dec74,"A growing body of research has identified sugary drinks as the biggest contributors to added, empty calories in the American",2014-02-13,"Sugar-sweetened drinks are displayed at a store on Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2013 in Montpelier, Vt. A prominent Vermont economist is warning that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages will send more Vermonters out of state to shop. Supporters of the measure says the state needs the revenue to pay for health programs, and that Vermonters need to be encouraged to drink less of the beverages, which have been tied to a nationwide increase in obesity nationwide.(AP Photo/Toby Talbot)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dddaa1f00002c0021c78d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sharon BernsteinSACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb 13 (Reuters) - All sodas and other sugar-sweetened drinks sold in California would be required to carry warning labels for obesity, diabetes and tooth decay under a bill introduced in Sacramento on Thursday, backed by several public health advocacy groups.If passed, caloric drinks would join tobacco and alcohol products in carrying health warning labels in California, the nation's most populous state and a legislative trend-setter.Proponents say the first-of-its kind effort takes aim at the epidemic of obesity in the United States, where 35.7 percent of adults and 16.9 percent of children aged 2 to 19 are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A growing body of research has identified sugary drinks as the biggest contributors to added, empty calories in the American diet, and as a major culprit in a range of costly health problems associated with being overweight.The proposal is expected to face stiff opposition from the beverage industry, which has fought efforts elsewhere to clamp down on the consumption of high-calorie beverages ranging from soda to sports drinks.In New York City in 2012, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg spearheaded a ban on sales of large sugary drinks, but the move was later declared illegal by a state judge after a legal challenge by soft drink makers and a restaurant group.New York's highest court has agreed to hear an appeal.San Francisco voters may decide on a ballot initiative that would impose a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sodas and other drinks with added sugar sold there, but two other California cities failed in their attempts to impose a special soda tax, as did the ski resort town of Telluride, Colorado.The American Beverage Association, which represents industry leaders such as Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc, has said raising taxes and restricting soft drink consumption will not necessarily lead to a healthier population.Critics of such moves have derided them for what they call the rise of the ""nanny state"". EDUCATIONBut supporters of the legislation introduced on Thursday by California state Senator Bill Monning, a Democrat from Carmel, said the labels merely provide consumers with information they should have to make healthy, informed choices.""This is about education,"" said Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy, which is supporting the measure along with the California Medical Association and other health groups in the state.Obesity accounts for nearly $200 billion a year in U.S. medical spending, more than 20 percent of national healthcare costs, according to a 2012 report in the Journal of Health Economics. It also is linked to lower worker productivity and diminished quality of life.Monning compared his proposed labeling with warnings carried on tobacco and alcohol products.""When the science is this conclusive, the state of California has a responsibility to take steps to protect consumers,"" he said in a statement.By the sheer magnitude of California's economy, requiring safety labels on sodas sold there would likely influence other states or the federal government to follow suit.Under the bill, all beverage containers with added sweeteners that have 75 calories or more per 12 ounces must carry a label that reads: State of California Safety Warning: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay"".Goldstein said the requirement would effectively apply to any sugar-sweetened bottled and canned sodas, energy drinks, sports drinks, vitamin water and iced teas, all of which he said have been marketed more aggressively by beverage makers in recent years.The label text was developed by a national panel of nutrition and public health experts, he said.Supporters of the measure cite research showing sodas and other sugary drinks account for 43 percent of added calories in the American diet over the past 30 years.Drinking just one soda a day increases an adult's likelihood of being overweight by 27 percent and a child's by 55 percent, while a soda or two a day increases the risk of diabetes by 26 percent, medical studies show.Unless current trends are reversed, health advocates say, one in three U.S. children born after the year 2000 - and nearly half of Latino and African-American children - will develop type-2 diabetes in their lifetimes.Other health risks linked with obesity include heart disease, cancer and asthma."
