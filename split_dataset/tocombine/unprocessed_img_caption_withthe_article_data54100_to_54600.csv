John McCain blamed President Barack Obama for the shooting in Orlando.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is ""directly responsible"" for the Orlando, Florida, massacre, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) charged Thursday.McCain, one of the Senate's most hawkish members and long a vigorous advocate of military intervention in the Middle East, said Obama was at fault because he pulled troops from Iraq too soon and failed to respond more vigorously to the rise of the so-called Islamic State, according to The Associated Press and numerous reporters who were listening.“Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama’s failures,” McCain said, according to The Washington Post.McCain quickly tried to soften his criticism, taking to Twitter soon after his comments were reported to say he was blaming Obama's policies, not the president himself.McCain also released a longer statement on his website saying, ""I misspoke,"" although he did not apologize or withdraw the claim that Obama was responsible for creating the conditions that inspired Omar Mateen to buy an assault-style weapon and go on a hate-fueled shooting spree.McCain has long blamed Obama for the quagmire in the Middle East while ignoring the previous president's rush to war in Iraq, which set off the conflicts that gave birth in 2004 to the group now known as ISIS or ISIL as a branch of al Qaeda, which used the conflict to gain a foothold in Iraq. “As I have said, President Obama’s decision to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 led to the rise of ISIL,"" McCain said in his statement. ""I and others have long warned that the failure of the President’s policy to deny ISIL safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire, plan, direct or conduct attacks on the United States and Europe as they have done in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino and now Orlando.”In 2010, McCain actually referred to it as a ""victory"" when Obama pulled troops out of Iraq, though he said President George W. Bush deserved credit for the moment, too.The shooter in Orlando pledged allegiance to the group during the course of his attack at the Pulse nightclub where he killed 49 people over the weekend.Democrats immediately slammed McCain's statement as out of bounds.""Sen. McCain’s unhinged comments are just the latest proof that Senate Republicans are puppets of Donald Trump,"" said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).This post has been updated to include a tweet McCain sent after his initial comments and a follow-up statement, as well as a tweet from 2010 about troops leaving Iraq."

Researchers have been closely watching for the same issues among infants in Colombia. The virus arrived in Colombia in October 2015, about five months after the start of Brazil's outbreak.The Colombian study involved data on 65,726 Zika cases reported between Aug. 9, 2015 and April 2, 2016. These included 1,850 pregnant women in which the researchers knew the trimester in which the mother became infected.Of the 600 women infected during their third trimester, 90 percent have delivered their babies, and none gave birth to a child with microcephaly or other obvious birth defects.As of early April, most pregnancies in which women were infected in the first or second trimester were still ongoing, but some of those mothers have started to give birth. In these women, Honein said, there have been ""a growing number"" of problems.""I think the numbers are going to come up,"" said Honein, who expects increasing reports of microcephaly, brain anomalies and other birth defects among women infected with Zika earlier in their pregnancies.CDC investigators are working with their Colombian colleagues to determine which cases are due to Zika and which are due to another cause.

Last year, he went public about clocking enough shuteye, revealing he abstains from electronics before bedtime and focuses on deep breathing exercises to up his game. In that time, his shooting improved 29 percent and his turnovers dropped 37 percent when he got adequate sleep, according to data collected by Iguodala's Jawbone UP.“There's a direct correlation,” Iguodala said in an interview with Arianna Huffington in April.Last year, the Warriors enlisted Cheri Mah of the Human Performance Center -- a University of California, San Francisco, sports medicine clinic that focuses on injury prevention and performance -- to optimize the team’s sleep schedule. NBA teams are constantly on the road, and jet lag is a game changer.“For anyone aiming to be at their best, whether a pro athlete or weekend warrior, it is important to have a strong foundation of healthy and adequate sleep on a daily basis,” Mah told The Huffington Post.Though she has done other research on athletes, none of Mah's studies have specifically focused on the Warriors.Sleep needs to be a priority, and part of the athlete's job, she says, is to rest.The Warriors' sleep strategy is actually part of their playbook that they're not sharing with the public, Mah says, “or else it wouldn’t be a competitive advantage!”Game location, time zone, travel days and game times all factor into the equation.If you want to take your game to the next level, here is some research you might want to sleep on.1. Good sleep lets you work harderMah and her team recently recruited 12 male cyclists to limit their sleep to four hours for three days in a row. She compared the athletes' workouts on those days to workouts on days after the athletes had slept for ten hours. For the workouts after the athletes were sleep deprived, energy expenditure decreased by 3.9 percent, maximal aerobic power decreased by 2.9 percent and exercise time to exhaustion decreased by 10.7 percent. 2. Sleep keeps you in the gameSeveral studies have linked sleep with brain benefits like keeping your memory sharp, upping creativity and keeping you focused. And on the court, those brain benefits are linked to better performance.Studies in tennis players have found that adequate sleep can improve accuracy and coordination on the court.3. Sleep training can up free throw shootingMah's team has also previously followed Stanford University’s men’s basketball team during a five- to seven-week sleep intervention. The players got as much sleep as possible during that period -- spending a minimum of 10 hours in bed each night. Their free throw shooting percentage increased 9 percent.Mah has not tracked how much sleep has improved the Warriors free throw shooting (at least not in a published study), but with the team’s free throw percentages just ahead of the Cavs, this is one measure the Warriors would do well to keep their edge on.

5,BUSINESS,Walmart No Longer Needs You To Bring Your Wallet,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walmart-pay-app-smartphone_us_5762e171e4b09c926cfe7abc,"At least in seven states, you can forget the cash and cards.",2016-06-16,Someday maybe you can buy everything from Walmart.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57631e402200002e00f8175e.jpeg?ops=crop_0_13_3473_1893%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In seven states, you can shop at Walmart even if you leave your wallet at home. The huge retailer announced Thursday that it has expanded its Walmart Pay option -- by which users can upload their payment information once onto the company's app and then pay digitally when checking out -- to Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Georgia.Customers have been able to use the app to check out in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas since May.App-based payment is becoming increasingly common. The trend started with Apple Pay, which is available on newer iPhones and can be used at any of Apple's many retail partners. Individual retail chains are now adding payment functions to their own apps: Dunkin' Donuts has one, as does Starbucks. (Between its payment app and its gift cards, the coffee giant holds $1.2 billion in deposits from customers, according to the The Wall Street Journal.)This is the frontier, where paying meets marketing. When the Walmart app makes shopping easier, that keeps people coming back to the stores, not to mention opening the app. Elsewhere, credit cards with computer chips are forcing people to wait — gasp — another few seconds before their payments are approved. Faster app-based payment can create customer loyalty. Walmart is counting on that. In the states where Walmart Pay has already been available for a few weeks, 80 percent of people using it have been repeat customers, according to company spokesperson Molly Blakeman.The goal is that, ultimately, people will buy everything at Walmart because it's just too easy. Technology can help make that dream come true.""One day we hope that people don’t remember if they purchased something online or in a Walmart store because it’s so seamless,"" said Blakeman, noting that even now it's possible to order something online, pick it up in a store and pay using the app.Mindless consumerism is so hot."

It was from my radio show co-host, Steph Taylor inviting me to a vigil to be held in our local town… a vigil for Orlando.I did not know anything had happened in Orlando, but as with all other mass shootings, I usually got the first news from such a text as Steph’s.A popular LGBTQ club called Pulse had been invaded by an assault rifle wielding gunman and 49 LGBTQ people were dead, and an equal amount severely wounded.For whatever reason, my first exposure to commentary by those seeking to lead our nation was that of Donald Trump. He was opportunistic in his commentary. The first tweets I saw were: “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.”“Reporting that Orlando killer shouted 'Allah hu Akbar!' as he slaughtered clubgoers.”And: “What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban.”While mentioning the “victims and their families” once, Mr. Trump never once commented on the hate crime that had been enacted on the LGBTQ community as a whole, or the feelings, impact and terror the days events had on us.He did have a passing reference about “second man arrested in L.A. with rifles near gay parade.” This, Mr. Trump reported as passionless information. The man, as it turns out, was not a second to the Orlando shooting, but completely unrelated. He also did not fit Trump’s Muslim ban narrative — the man in Los Angeles was from Indiana.As Mr. Trump was trying to pad his Islamophobic opportunism, I was engaging with one of his supporters on Twitter. The man’s tweet read, “Well there was a bad shooting in the gay community. Sorry for your loss.” It was followed by a meme that read: “Nice!”I contrast Mr. Trumps response with that of his rival, Mrs. Clinton. She wrote a measured commentary and included this specific message: “This was also an act of hate. The gunman attacked an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them. We will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear. Hate has absolutely no place in America.”Even former rival Ted Cruz, no ally to the LGBTQ community said, “Now is the opportunity to speak out against an ideology that calls for the murder of gays and lesbians. ISIS and the theocracy in Iran (supported with American taxpayer dollars) regularly murder homosexuals, throwing them from buildings and burying them under rocks. This is wrong, it is evil, and we must all stand against it. Every human being has a right to live according to his or her faith and conscience, and nobody has a right to murder someone who doesn’t share their faith or sexual orientation.”Dear Mr. Trump,"
7,POLITICS,Lawsuit Filed After White Schoolboys Allegedly Drag Black Classmate With A Rope,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-girl-rope-burn-lawsuit_us_5762db56e4b09c926cfe762d,“It looked like somebody had ripped her neck apart and stitched it back together.”,2016-06-16,K.P.'s parents are suing Live Oak Classical School after their daughter sustained a serious rope burn on an overnight class trip.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5762dc421500002a0073aef1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The parents of a 12-year-old Texas girl, who sustained a severe rope burn on her neck during an overnight school field trip to Germer Ranch in Blanco County, Texas, filed a lawsuit Monday against Live Oak Classical School. Sandy Rougely and Kevin Parker are seeking $3 million in damages -- to cover the cost of medical expenses, physical pain, mental anguish, disfigurement, impairment, loss of use and enjoyment of life of their daughter, who is being referred to as K.P.. They are suing for such a large amount “to not only compensate the victims in this case, but to deter this type of egregious conduct from others in the future, and to serve as an example to all educational institutions that this type of behavior is unacceptable,” the lawsuit says. “When we began to dig deeper into what happened, we were shocked at the utter failure in how Live Oak handled this situation after the injury occurred,"" Levi G. McCathern, the family’s attorney, told The Huffington Post in a statement. ""Their tone deaf approach reflects an attitude that our client’s injury was not worth investigating, or even informing her mother about.”“It was evident from our initial assessment that this case is not one of mere negligent supervision, but of a systematic and organizational failure in leadership by those in charge of the Live Oak Classical School,” the statement continued.During a class visit to the ranch on April 28, the children came across a rope swing hanging from a tree. A second, longer rope was tied to the seat so that the children could pull the rope, lift the swing into the air and help the occupant swing. Three of K.P.'s classmates used this rope to hurt her, according to the lawsuit: Behind her in this group, within an arms length, were three boys, one of whom was the same boy Sandy had alerted Live Oak was bullying K.P. During one swing, K.P. watched as some of the other kids pulled the pull-rope back, ready to swing another child. She watched the kids let the rope go, thinking this was just like every other turn. However, she did not see what the boys behind her were doing, and the next thing K.P. knew, she felt the rope wrap around her neck and she was violently jerked to the ground with the pull-rope wrapped around her neck. “It looked like somebody had ripped her neck apart and stitched it back together,” Rougely told The Dallas Morning News last month.The racial connotations of the case are hard to ignore. K.P. is black and the three boys are white. “It’s nearly impossible to argue that this was somehow an accident that could have happened to any child that day, regardless of race,” McCathern said in a statement released by the firm. “The severity and specificity of the injury certainly point to this incident being racial, but because the incident occurred behind K.P., and because no chaperone or teacher was there to see how the rope got around her neck. Only the children involved know the motivation behind this incident.”Live Oak said in a statement that it takes allegations of racism very seriously. The school said it interviewed eyewitnesses and couldn't find any evidence that racism played a role. ""I have interviewed the students, the chaperones and the doctor who treated the student right after the accident, and the information I obtained points to nothing but an unfortunate accident,"" David Deaconson, the school's lawyer, told The Huffington Post. ""This is a private school that people choose to either attend or not. There is a public school choice in Waco ISD. If a child is truly being bullied in a private school throughout the school year and the parent is concerned about bullying and the school’s alleged lack of concern, would a parent re-enroll their child for the next school year?""K.P. told The Dallas Morning News that she thought the boys had hurt her intentionally. She said if the boys would have let go of the rope, it should have fallen instead of jerking her to the ground.“That’s why I think it was on purpose,” she said. “I think someone tried to tie it around my neck.”The lawsuit claims that because none of the boys, or other children, helped K.P. off the ground the incident was not accidental. The family also claims Allison Buras, the school’s dean, did not look into the incident, nor did she notify K.P.'s mother of her daughter's injury. ""For Live Oak to bury their head in the sand and chalk this incident up to an 'accident' or 'kids being kids' is irresponsible but unfortunately all too common,"" McCathern said in the statement. ""Regardless of who or what caused the rope to get around K.P.’s neck, Live Oak’s tone deaf response only amplifies an already horrific problem.""K.P. attended Live Oak Classical School, a predominantly white private school, during the 2015-2016 school year. But in fall 2015, K.P. told her parents that her classmates wouldn’t speak to her and that she was being bullied, according to the lawsuit. It goes on to allege that, in one incident, a boy pushed K.P. on the ground. In another, the same boy pushed, kicked and shoved K.P. during a class assignment while the teacher was not looking. Rougely told Buras that her daughter was being bullied but, according to the lawsuit, Buras dismissed the incidents saying they weren't malicious. The lawsuit further alleges that Live Oak’s administration even placed partial blame on K.P. “Occasionally, I can get her to smile but it is rare. Socially, she does not interact with her classmates,” Melinda Johnson, the girl’s science teacher, said in an email to Rougely that was presented as part of the lawsuit. Johnson added that K.P. was not “emotive” despite working well with other students. Buras also pointed out in an email that she was “concerned about [K.P’s] social development” since she struggled at her previous school. “Live Oak seemed concerned only with the symptoms of the bullying, rather than the problem,” the lawsuit says. But the school maintains that K.P.’s injuries were accidental, and not a result of bullying. Deaconson told The Dallas Morning News that the school will “stand behind the facts.”“We all know anybody can allege anything in a lawsuit. That doesn’t make it true,” he said. “We also need to keep in mind we’ve got 12-year-old kids involved, and adults need to react in a way that doesn’t put the 12-year-olds’ safety at risk, which many of them already have.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said Germer Ranch is in Waco, Texas, and incorrectly described bullying as having taken place in fall 2016.This article was updated after publication to include a statement from David Deaconson, Live Oak's lawyer."

Donald Trump's response to the attack didn't go over well with most Americans. And few voters say that Obama's endorsement changed their minds about the election. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, June 16, 2016. AMERICANS VIEW ORLANDO SHOOTING AS BOTH HATE CRIME AND TERRORISM - Anthony Salvanto, Fred Backus, Sarah Dutton and Jennifer De Pinto: ""Most Americans (57 percent) describe the shooting over the weekend at a nightclub in Orlando as both an act of terrorism and a hate crime against gays and lesbians. 14 percent think it was mostly a terror act, while 25 percent think it was mostly a hate crime…. President Obama gets net positive ratings for his response to the shooting in Orlando. 44 percent approve, while 34 percent disapprove. About a quarter don't have an opinion. When asked to assess the responses of the presumptive nominees for President, Americans are divided on Hillary Clinton's response to the attack, while ratings of Trump are more negative. 51 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is responding to the Orlando attack, while just 25 percent approve. Most Democrats (62 percent) approve of Clinton's response, while just half of Republicans (50 percent) approve of Trump's. More independents are critical of Trump's response than Clinton's."" [CBS] Trump’s response was not what Americans wanted - Philip Bump: ""On Monday, [Donald] Trump gave a speech...suggesting an expansion of his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country and casting suspicion on Muslims already living in the United States. In a speech on Wednesday, he seemed to renew an argument that he first brought up last year: surveilling mosques and Muslim communities more broadly to suss out terror links. And, of course, Trump also suggested that President Obama has been soft in the fight on terror because he sympathizes with Muslims. A Bloomberg poll conducted after the attack found that Trump's proposals on surveillance and aspersions against Obama aren't very popular. What's more, his proposal to ban Muslims from traveling to the U.S. remains unpopular, with two-thirds of those who had an opinion disapproving. That's slightly more support than polling found right after he first proposed it, but not much….Trump's response to the shooting, in other words, mostly isn't in line with how Americans think the country should respond. Which may be part of the reason why, when asked how the current and next president have responded to Orlando, Trump gets far worse marks than either Obama or Hillary Clinton."" [WashPost]VOTERS SAY THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT OBAMA'S ENDORSEMENT - HuffPollster: ""President Barack Obama’s endorsement of Hillary Clinton won’t change what most people do at the voting booth in November, voters say. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, just 14 percent of voters say Obama’s endorsement makes them more likely to support Clinton. Twenty-two percent say it makes them less likely to do so, and 62 percent say it doesn’t make any difference….It makes sense to be wary of questions like this. People aren’t necessarily reliable narrators of their own motivations for voting, and, more than anything, their responses may reflect their pre-existing feelings about both politicians….Regardless of whether he directly changes any minds, Obama’s willingness to act as a campaign surrogate, and to directly challenge presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, comes from a place of strength….But there’s an interesting contradiction at work: While opinions of Obama’s presidency are on the upswing, opinions about the country as a whole haven’t followed suit."" [HuffPost] VOTERS DIFFER ON REASONS FOR DISLIKING CLINTON AND TRUMP - Morning Consult: ""[T]he main drivers of Clinton and Trump’s unfavorable numbers play in to larger campaign narratives: Voters think Trump is racist, and Clinton is untrustworthy.

Notable snafus in the past have included failing to predict Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservatives would win a majority in last year’s general election. The handful of pollsters in Switzerland, where as many as 12 popular initiatives are put to a national ballot each year, share their U.K. counterparts’ predicament. While they have the advantage of historical data stretching back to 1891, they have to glean information in a linguistically and culturally diverse country, making it difficult to gauge overarching national trends.

Chefs, caterers and restaurants have been utilizing the private Facebook group Culinary Cares: In Support of Pulse Orlando to coordinate food donations, as well as to alert one another of places in the city which would benefit from their help in the aftermath of the tragedy. Through the group -- which was created by Kendra Lott, publisher of Edible Orlando magazine and her friend Gary Appelsies -- thousands of meals have already been provided to people in Orlando.Appelsies told The Huffington Post that the group is just a way for those in the food community to show their support for those dealing with tragedy. ""Food is comfort. Food brings people together. ... Food nourishes the soul,"" Appelsies told HuffPost. ""People need to be nourished. People need something that's going to bring them together.""In addition to providing food, people have also donated water, utensils, catering trucks and other supplies. Restaurants, restaurant groups, caterers, food writers and others have joined the giving efforts with much of the donations going to individuals in the medical community, blood donors, grief counselors and victims' loved ones, among other recipients. Lott explained to HuffPost that an overwhelming number of people in the food community were interested in helping, and the group seemed like a perfect way to rally everyone within the culinary scene around a common cause. ""Because the culinary community works together so often, it was very natural for us to combine our efforts and share resources,"" she said. Alexia Gawlak of Swine & Sons, whose food donations went to victims' families, told HuffPost that when she dropped off food, she was able to interact with residents. ""The most memorable thing is the conversations with the other volunteers,"" Gawlak said. ""Everyone you encounter, you're hugging. Everyone's saying thank you to everyone. ... It was a great vibe from everyone volunteering. It was extremely cathartic as an Orlandoan.""While many of the group members are still processing the tragedy that's occurred, Lott says they're committed to doing their part to be of assistance at this time. ""It's still so soon that it's almost inconceivable that this has happened,"" Lott said. ""But the one thing that we need to do every day is nourish ourselves and if there's anything that this community can do to help people close to this tragedy to do that, then we will continue to do so.""

Though she said she is grateful to be a survivor, Carter said this comes with a great weight.""The guilt of feeling grateful to be alive is heavy,"" the 20-year-old said, hands trembling. ""Wanting to smile about surviving, but not sure if the people around you are ready as the world mourns the victims killed and viciously slain. I feel guilty about screaming about my legs in pain because I could feel nothing like the other 49 who weren't so lucky to feel this pain of mine.""Carter, who was in Orlando on vacation from Philadelphia, said she fled to the bathroom when the shooter, Omar Mateen, began his onslaught. While Mateen was in the bathroom, Carter said she heard him pledge his allegiance to ISIS during a phone conversation with police negotiators.She also said she heard him ask, ""Are there any black people in here?""After another black person replied yes, Mateen said, ""I don't have a problem with black people,"" according to Carter. ""This is about my country. You guys suffered enough.""Carter recalled the bloody scene in the bathroom. She said as she was lying on the floor looking at the ""piles"" of bodies, she ""made peace with God and within myself.""Before police breached a bathroom wall to enter the club, Mateen killed three more victims. One of those victims was shielding Carter from the gunfire. ""If it wasn't for that person shielding me it would've been me shot and I wouldn't be sitting here today,"" she said, adding that the shooter wouldn't stop until he was killed by police.Carter, who had been shot in both legs, went to the club that night with two friends, Tiara Parker and Akyra Murray. Parker was injured but survived. Murray did not. She said her poem was inspired by feeling at fault for Murray's death:""The guilt of feeling lucky to be alive is heavy. It's like the weight of the ocean's walls crushing uncontrolled by levies. It's like being drug through the grass with a shattered leg and thrown on the back of a Chevy. It's like being rushed to the hospital and being told you're gonna make it when you're laid beside individuals whose lives were brutally taken. The guilt of being alive is heavy.""Her poem not only highlights how much she -- and likely others -- is struggling with being one of the survivors, but also that the people affected by the homophobic massacre, including the LGBTQ community, will be mourning for a long time.Watch Carter recite her full poem in the video above.Donate to Pulse Orlando Relief Fund here: "

Undoubtedly, the baseball game against the San Francisco Giants will be of secondary importance to many fans in attendance  after Sunday's devastating attack against the queer community in Orlando, Florida. A game will indeed happen and fans will cheer, but the night's true stars will be the people donating blood and money around Tropicana Field to help the victims.There will be time for pre-game dedications, remembrances and a moment of silence on Friday night, but fans will take it upon themselves to commit to real action. On Tuesday, the Rays announced a series of in-game initiatives for fans to tangibly show their support and help victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting. The team is charging $5 for the remaining open seats to the game, and 100 percent of proceeds from those ticket sales will go to the Pulse Victims Fund. Additionally, the Pulse Victims Fund will receive proceeds from the Rays' daily 50/50 raffle, as well as money from donation centers around the ballpark. To incentivize support for critical medical care needed for victims, fans donating blood at Tropicana Field via OneBlood will also get free tickets to a future Rays game. A Rays spokesman wouldn't disclose the amount of $5 tickets sold over the past day, but told The Huffington Post on Wednesday that the response has been ""overwhelming."" To accommodate ticket demands, they've decided to open up the highest tier of seats, which are normally tarped off and not for sale — a move the team says they haven't done since they last made the playoffs in 2013. That should free up about 10,000 more tickets for sale. Equality Florida, a partner in the Rays' annual Pride Night and organizers of the official GoFundMe campaign, announced on Tuesday that the Pulse Victims Fund had broken the previous GoFundMe donation record of $2 million. At the time of publication, over $4 million has been donated to the online fundraiser. When reached for comment on Wednesday, Michael Farmer, Statewide Deputy Director of Development for Equality Florida, said he was previously unaware of the Rays' ""We Are Orlando"" dedication and donations, but said they've been a partner organization with the Rays and their annual Pride Night. ""It’s amazing to hear,"" a surprised Farmer said. ""When you think about how many people were affected, we want to make sure to getting their lives back to whole."" ""It’s outstanding to see people thinking of any way they can help. The generosity of the Rays is in line with what many others are doing,"" he added. As Farmer noted, the Rays aren't the only organization using their resources to assist victims. Disney announced on Tuesday that it's donating $1 million to a support fund and providing free lodging for relatives and friends of victims. Even Chick-fil-A, a company that's donated to anti-gay groups in the past and is famously closed on Sundays, saw local Orlando chain operators open their restaurants on Sunday to provide free food for those in line waiting to donate blood.To the Orlando shooting victims, every person's individual contribution can make a real difference.

Whatever sort of ruckus was served up at the Brontë Society this weekend, it had been brewing for some time.

The announcement came about 19 hours after the toddler's father reported witnessing the horrific attack along the Seven Seas Lagoon at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort.Demings identified the parents as Matt and Melissa Graves, and the child as Lane.""There's no reason for us to believe that the body that was recovered is not that of Lane Graves,"" Demings said. Demings said the child's body was found completely intact ""within the immediate area of where he was last seen.""""There's likely no question in my mind that the child was drowned by the alligator,"" he said. The Graves, from Elkhorn, Nebraska, had been enjoying the waterfront area with their other 4-year-old child when the 2-year-old stepped out into the water around 9:30 p.m., Demings said. There were ""no swimming"" signs posted near the lagoon, police had said. Demings refused to put blame on the child's parents, however, instead saying, ""I believe what this 2-year-old was doing was what perhaps any 2-year-old would be doing.""The boy's father tried to wrestle him away from the gator but was unsuccessful. Witnesses reportedly tried to help as well.A dive team, helicopters and sonar imaging helped searched for the child. In the process, five gators were captured.The child's body was located around 1:45 p.m. Wednesday, Demings said, about ""10-15 yards out ... maybe, what I was told, approximately 6 feet deep in the water.""Demings said he and a Catholic priest delivered the news to the boy's parents.""Of course, the family was distraught but also I believe somewhat relieved that they were able to find their son with his body intact,"" he said.Nick Wiley, executive director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said there's a ""good chance"" they've captured the alligator responsible for the attack, ""but we're going to go through the process of forensics.""That process will include matching bite marks to the alligators already captured.

18,BUSINESS,A Reason To Shop At H&M That Has Nothing To Do With Fashion,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gender-equality-fashion-equality_us_57604b13e4b0e4fe5143e857,It’s one of just nine major companies that have at least 40 percent women in leadership.,2016-06-15,A new index is helping shoppers who care about gender equality make better decisions about where to spend their money. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576073f91500002b0073a880.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here's a reason to spend more money at H&M: The fast-fashion retailer is closing in on gender equality. Women make up 58 percent of H&M's board and 41 percent of its top leadership team, according to data released Tuesday by LedBetter, a new research group that tracks gender in leadership. The name is a pun (Led ... better. Get it?) that references Lilly Ledbetter, whose fight for fair pay inspired a national law on the issue.H&M ranks at the top of LedBetter’s list, composed of 230 companies culled from the Fortune 100, Forbes's list of the most valuable brands, and a few other businesses deemed recognizable by the organization's founders, journalist Iris Kuo and her friend Camille Ricketts, whose day job is in venture capitalism. The group gave each company a score based on the percent of women in the boardroom and the C-suite.Just nine companies had women in at least 40 percent of these roles.""We were heartened to see there are companies out there that are close to approaching gender equality. It's disappointing there aren't more,"" Kuo told The Huffington Post. The push in Europe to set quotas for the percentage of women who sit on boards helped drive some of these companies to parity. Women make up 55 percent of the board of Paris-based Kering, which owns such fashion labels as Gucci and Stella McCartney. In France, public companies are required to have boards with at least 40 percent women by 2017.Prada is based in Italy, where boards need to be 33 percent female. The fashion label's board falls short of the mandate at 22 percent female, but 67 percent of leaders at Prada are women. In Britain, home to Unilever and Diageo, there's a voluntary effort that aims to get board representation up to 30 percent.There's been talk of a quota in H&M's home, Sweden, but the country hasn't put one in place yet. Still, women hold a stunning 58 percent of board seats.Just 20 percent of board seats at S&P 500 companies are held by women. Quotas have been unpopular in the U.S., making the inclusion of Target, Etsy, Best Buy and Gap on the above list more notable, Kuo said in an email.Gap has been outspoken about its efforts to promote more women into leadership positions and make sure women and men are fairly compensated at the firm -- announcing for the past two years that there's no gender pay gap at Gap, which also includes the Banana Republic, Old Navy and Athleta brands.Women dominate the Gap -- 73 percent of store managers, nearly three-quarters of employees and more than 65 percent of customers are women. ""Hiring women is part of our DNA,"" Peter Pawlick, the company's senior director of compensation, told The Huffington Post a few months ago.Getting more women into the boardroom is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to treating women fairly at work. Flexible workplace policies, performance reviews that remove gender bias from the equation and generous leave policies are all good measures to judge how an employer is treating women.Kuo said she hopes her index will help shoppers make better decisions about where to spend their money. And gender equality is but one measure by which to judge a company. H&M, to be sure, has been criticized for selling the kind of disposable items that ultimately become a strain on the environment.And LedBetter hasn't looked at racial diversity at these companies or even gender diversity among the rank and file. Another app, the Buy Up Index, offers a more comprehensive rating system to judge female empowerment at various brands."

""It’s not a surprise that the American people are skeptical of all of us in political life. And we ought to step back and reassess why, and what we can do about it.""Top Democrats have taken steps in the last week to begin rallying behind Clinton and ease Sanders out of the race without alienating his supporters.President Barack Obama endorsed Clinton on Thursday, hours after meeting with Sanders at the White House. Clinton also secured the endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leader of the party's progressive wing.Clinton already has turned her attention on the campaign trail to the race with Trump, rejecting the New York businessman's renewed calls for a ban of the entry of foreign-born Muslims into the United States after the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, by an American man who claimed allegiance with Islamic State militants.""I have clearly said that we faced terrorist enemies who use a perverted version of Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them, and we will,"" Clinton said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. ""But I will not demonize and declare war on an entire religion.""(Additional reporting by Alana Wise, Amanda Becker and James Oliphant; Editing by Leslie Adler and Nick Macfie)"

Though many of us have grown accustomed to seeing Sager and his flamboyant attire all the way through the conference finals, he's never actually reported on the NBA's biggest stage.Sager expressed his interest in joining the ESPN group to Sports Illustrated in an interview published Wednesday:Would I be interested? My God, of course! But I didn’t want to step on anyone's toes, and ESPN has a cast of hundreds. I didn’t want to take away from what Doris [Burke] or anyone else on the crew did. But yeah, I wanted to be a part of it.So why wait until Game 6? According to Sports Illustrated, Sager was scheduled for eight days of chemotherapy following the conclusion of the Western Conference Finals. “That would be the only time I could do a game, and so it had to be Game 6,"" Sager told Sports Illustrated. Sager was diagnosed with leukemia in 2014. For a stretch, his cancer had gone into remission, but Sager announced in a interview with HBO's ""Real Sports"" in March that it had returned. Doctors told Sager that a patient not receiving treatment for his diagnosis generally would have just three to six months to live.However, Sager went on to tell Sports Illustrated that he did not want to steal the spotlight from the Warriors or the Cavaliers.""I've been watching the series very closely and, while I do not want to distract in any way from the event itself, I look forward to being in the building for what will be an incredibly exciting Game 6,"" Sager said. ""The NBA community is a very special one and this is a great honor.""With everything set, we now just have to wait and see what wild outfit Sager wears for his first-ever NBA Finals appearance.

""And the victim in this case was extremely vulnerable. That’s an element of the crime. ... So I have considered that.""Persky's sentence for the Jan. 18, 2015, attack has stirred international outrage. Two online petitions demanding Persky's ouster have each accumulated more than 1 million signatures. Members of Congress and the California legislature have signaled support for that effort.Prosecutors during the hearing requested Turner be sentenced to six years in state prison. District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement afterward that the “punishment does not fit the crime.”This week, the Santa Clara County court recorder began releasing the hearing transcript after requests from several media outlets, including The Huffington Post. The Guardian website posted the full transcript on Tuesday.Persky brought up the issue of alcohol several times, according to the transcript, but repeatedly said it was a minor factor in his decision. Turner's blood alcohol level was 0.13, and the victim's was estimated to be 0.24 -- three times the legal limit for driving.""I have also considered the fact that he was legally intoxicated at the time of the incident,"" Persky said of Turner. ""Pursuant to the evidence at trial, this does affect judgment. And as I indicated previously, it’s not an -- and, I think, as [the victim] wrote -- it’s not an excuse. But it is a factor. And I think it is a factor that, when trying to assess moral culpability in this situation, is mitigating.""Persky continued: ""The argument can be made that it’s more morally culpable for someone with no alcohol in their system to commit an offense like that than with someone who was legally intoxicated at the rate of 0.16 or so."" The judge added that he was not ""relying on that"" reasoning.U.S. Rep Ted Poe (R-Texas) told HuffPost last week that Persky got the sentence ""wrong.""""Alcohol makes it worse -- it doesn’t mitigate it, it makes it worse,"" Poe said.Turner, in his statements to the court, blamed alcohol for his behavior. Persky ran through other factors, including that Turner was not armed, showed no ""criminal sophistication,"" and had no previous criminal convictions, though he had a pending charge of possessing alcohol as a minor. Court documents show Turner failed to acknowledge he committed an assault. Even after a jury convicted him, he insisted his actions were consensual, according to the documents. ""Mr. Turner came before us today and said he was genuinely sorry for all the pain that he has caused to [the woman] and her family,"" Persky said. ""And I think that is a genuine feeling of remorse. [The woman] has stated that he hasn’t really taken responsibility for his conduct. And I think at one point she basically wrote or said that 'He -- he just doesn’t get it.'""And so you have Mr. Turner expressing remorse, which I think, subjectively, is genuine, and [the woman] not seeing that as a genuine expression of remorse because he never says, 'I did this. I knew how drunk you were. I knew how out of it you were, and I did it anyway,'"" Persky continued. ""And that -- I don’t think that bridge will, probably, ever be crossed.""Persky added: ""I’m not convinced that his lack of complete acquiescence to the verdict should count against him with respect to an expression of remorse because I do find that his remorse is genuine.""Turner is scheduled to be released from jail on Sept. 2. _______ Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.

Donald Trump has doubled down on his proposal to ban Muslims into the U.S., social media has been rife with anti-Muslim rhetoric and there's evidence of the news media promoting such bigotry. But a New York City woman is reminding us of how much good and love there remains in our communities, with a moving Facebook post she published this week.Amaira Hasan, 25, was on the train on her way to work on Monday morning when an unidentified white man wheeling a baby in a stroller entered and began yelling at two Muslim women wearing hijabs.He told the “two terrorist foreigners to go back to where they came from,” Hasan wrote in her Facebook post. “The man insisted that the two women go back home and take their bombs with them.”The train erupted in anger as a diverse group of passengers confronted the man, Hasan said.“A black man, a Romanian, a gay man, a bunch of Asians, and a score of others came to [the women’s] defense demanding that this man leave these women alone and get off this train,” Hasan wrote.Hasan told the New York Daily News that the man quieted down after one passenger told him pointedly: “This is New York City. The most diverse place in the world. And in New York, we protect our own and we don't give a fuck what anyone looks like or who they love, or any of those things. It's time for you to leave these women alone, Sir.”Hasan said the man soon got off the train, though it’s unclear if a train conductor was involved in his departure. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority told DNA Info that it had no record of the incident.Hasan, who practices Islam but does not wear a hijab, said she was extremely proud to see her fellow New Yorkers standing up for two strangers, especially given the current climate.“In troubling times, people are scared,” she told DNA Info, “but it’s nice to see that end of the day, people are looking out for one another, and I think that’s what’s important.” Hasan's story is one example of how people have been challenging hate in the wake of the Orlando tragedy.LGBT activist Jacob Tobia penned a Facebook post condemning Islamophobia hours after the hours after shooting in Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, on Sunday. It has since gone viral.Also on Sunday, as his family awaited news of his sister, who had gone to Pulse with friends, Brian Alvear reminded people on social media to not blindly cast blame.“Listen I know a lot is happening and this a horrible thing and my family is dealing with it firsthand, but don't you fucking dare blame this on a group of people, this was 1 sick mother fucker. Don't blame anything but that,” he wrote.Alvear soon learned that his sister, Amanda, was one of the 49 people killed in the massacre. “I know my sister and I know my parents and I know me, and we don’t want to spread a message of hate,” Alvear told ABC News in a later interview. Amanda would've wanted the family to “unify in love,” he stressed.Read more on the Orlando Shooting:"

I don’t know. We’re in a really challenging place as a country right now,” Washington said. “Some of the rhetoric around women, around immigrants, around people of color is breathtaking to me.”“I think also there are a lot of us who are fighting for inclusivity and justice. I don’t know that it’s in the next term, but maybe,” she said.Asked if there are any women she'd like to see aiming for the White House, Washington said, “Somebody that I’m a huge fan of, but she’s running for Senate right now, is Kamala Harris in California. I think she’s extraordinary. I do think she could be president one day.”Harris came in first in the primary for California’s open Senate seat earlier this month.

Is. Major. Prince William just made history by becoming the first royal to ever cover a gay magazine. The prince, who, along with his wife the Duchess of Cambridge and brother Prince Harry have made mental health the main focus of their work, has long championed anti-bullying efforts and shattering stigma surrounding mental health.This cover, and its corresponding meeting between William and LGBTQ youth who have experience dealing with both of those issues, further solidifies the royal family's commitment to spread awareness for anyone and everyone battling mental health issues. Attitude Magazine, the UK's ""best-selling gay magazine,"" brought the group of young LGBTQ people to meet with the prince at Kensington Palace back in May so that he could ""listen to their experience of bullying and the mental health impacts it can have,"" according to a press release. After meeting with the group and posing for his history-making cover shot, William spoke to the magazine about the ""truly brave"" young people he met with, praising their bravery to speak out and ""give hope to people who are going through terrible bullying right now.""""Their sense of strength and optimism should give us all encouragement to stand up to bullying wherever we see it,"" he said, adding, ""you should be proud of the person you are and you have nothing to be ashamed of."" The news comes just days after the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history occurred at gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, which killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. Will and the royal formerly known as Kate Middleton sent a message of support to victims on Tuesday at the U.S. Embassy in London. It was there, speaking with staff members, that William revealed he would be appearing in the magazine.Junior Joye, one of the attendees at the event who, as a YouTuber has dealt with online bullying, told The Huffington Post it was ""absolutely phenomenal to meet such a man."" ""He was incredibly humble and actually listened to what we had to say. It was one of the best days of my life,"" he said. Check out a video from the meeting below, and to see more head to Attitude Magazine."

33,POLITICS,Donald Trump Implies He Was Right To Imply That Obama Supports Terrorists,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-implies-obama-supports-terrorists_us_57615eede4b05e4be8604826,He blacklisted a major newspaper for saying he said this.,2016-06-15,"Donald Trump loves conspiracy theories, but hates when people accurately report things he says.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_8_365_4217_2347%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The presumptive Republican nominee for president implied Wednesday that he was right all along to suggest President Barack Obama sympathizes with Islamic terrorists. Donald Trump, who has long promoted the false conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya, tweeted Wednesday that he was right to raise the possibility a few days ago that Obama secretly sympathizes with radical Muslim terrorists.Trump's tweet reads: ""An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump 'may have insinuated about @POTUS.' But he's right."" (It's not clear what ""An"" means. Also, Trump seems to be referring to himself in the third person here, not quoting someone else.)The tweet also includes a link to a story by the Trump-cheerleading site Breitbart. That story claims that a document obtained by Judicial Watch shows that the Obama administration supported the work of al Qaeda in Iraq -- a predecessor to the self-described Islamic State militant group -- as an opponent of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.The Breitbart story doesn't actually appear to support Trump's claim, as The Guardian notes.On Monday, in the wake of a mass shooting by a terrorist sympathizer in Orlando, Florida, that left 49 people dead, Trump implied that Obama himself was in cahoots with terrorists. ""Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""And the something else in mind -- you know, people can't believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on.""In a separate interview Monday, Trump declined to clarify what exactly he meant, saying only, ""I'll let people figure that out for themselves.""Trump received a barrage of criticism for his baseless insinuation. Later, he seemed to deny having made it, growing incensed when The Washington Post reported that he had said the thing he said.In response to the Post's writeup of his Monday remarks, Trump put the newspaper on his lengthy media blacklist. (The Huffington Post is already on the blacklist -- join us!)In separate Facebook posts, Trump criticized the Post's headline and then announced the blacklisting. So, to recap: Trump implied that the president sympathizes with terrorists. Then he said it was ""phony and dishonest"" to report that he'd said such a thing. Then, he suggested that his original comments were right all along. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

What they found beneath the ground, however, was described as highly unusual.Inside the 4-foot-wide catch basin, Department of Transportation officials reported hooking an 11-foot-long gator, one they were photographed hauling out of the Whiskey Creek neighborhood with an excavator.Lee County's DOT says they typically handle one to two dead alligators in storm drains a year but rarely ones of this size.""DOT generally is alerted to such situations by reports of odor coming from a catch basin or when drainage is backed up for no obvious reason,"" the county said in an emailed press release.Lee County DOT Director Randy Cerchie called it business as usual.""This was an abnormally large gator, but removal is part of what we do,” he said in a statement.County spokeswoman Betsy Clayton told the News-Press that the gator likely entered the storm drain through the pipes.The big question: How did it get in? The county describes the pipes leading to the drain as only about 14-inches by 24-inches.“We don’t usually see gators that big because our pipes are not that big,” Cerchie said.According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, female American alligators rarely grow larger than 10-feet in length. Males can grow much larger, however.The largest gator ever found in the state was 14-feet, 3 1/2-inches in length, the FWC reported.The Lee County gator's body was hauled away in a dump truck to a DOT site that’s designated for dead animals, and there it was buried, the county said."
35,BUSINESS,The Federal Reserve Leaves Key Interest Rate Unchanged Amid Slower Job Growth,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-june-interest-rate-decision_us_57605632e4b053d433068b7f,The risk of a Brexit contributed to the Fed's decision.,2016-06-15,"In December, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen presided over the first interest rate increase since the financial crisis. Yellen held off on another one on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576059481500002a0073a7e1.jpeg?cache=fLVyE8Aiby&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it will keep its benchmark interest rate at current levels in response to lackluster job creation in recent months and other discouraging economic data.The decision will shield American consumers from higher borrowing costs, but it also reflects the fragility and unpredictability of the current economic recovery, some seven years after the Great Recession officially ended.The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is keeping the influential target federal funds rate -- the Fed-set interest rate banks charge one another for overnight lending -- at a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent. Since the rate is a benchmark for lending throughout the economy, leaving it unchanged will likely prevent higher interest rates on mortgages, car loans and other household debts.The Fed has a dual mandate to craft monetary policy that both maximizes employment and keeps inflation in check. The FOMC lowers the federal funds rate to accelerate job growth by reducing borrowing costs. It raises the rate to limit price inflation by slowing the pace of job growth.The FOMC’s decision not to do the latter in June was widely expected. Fed officials signaled earlier this month that disappointing job creation had undermined the case for a rate hike. The economy created just 38,000 jobs in May, and new data show that the preceding two months produced fewer jobs than previously believed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The central bank is also responding to tepid inflation. The price of consumer goods, excluding food and energy, rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in April, according to the price index favored by the Fed -- well below the Fed’s 2-percent target. And a University of Michigan survey revealed on Friday that U.S. households' expectations of long-term inflation are lower than they have been at any point since the survey began collecting data in 1979.In a press conference following the announcement, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen acknowledged the role that those developments played in the central bank’s decision, noting that “recent economic indicators have been mixed.”Yellen also said that the prospect of a “Brexit,” or British exit from the European Union, was “one of the factors” that led the central bank to hold off on an interest rate hike. The United Kingdom will vote on the country’s membership in the EU on June 23.If the U.K. chooses to leave the EU, which functions as a single market, it could ultimately have adverse effects on the U.S. economic outlook, Yellen suggested. A higher percentage of British voters supported Brexit than opposed it in a poll released on Monday.The Fed last raised the federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percentage point in December, the first increase since the financial crisis. The rate had been at or near zero -- 0 to 0.25 percent -- since December 2008.With the December interest rate increase, the Fed seemed to express confidence that the economic recovery had entered a new phase, indicating it was time to pivot to the work of preventing inflation. Yellen predicted that the move would be the first in a series of small interest rate hikes that would gradually raise rates to levels that are more historically normal.Since then, however, disappointing economic data have repeatedly delayed the pace of those increases. Slower global demand reduced the availability of credit, and wage growth remained sluggish, prompting the Fed not to raise the federal funds rate in March.Fed officials suggested in May that economic conditions would finally permit them to raise the rate again in June. But the May job creation data, released on June 3, rapidly dashed those plans.The central bank's next opportunity to announce a rate hike will be July 27, after a meeting of the FOMC.Wednesday’s announcement will come as welcome news to many progressive economists and activists who have long argued that the job market has much more room to grow before inflation becomes a serious problem.While the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, much of its recent decline is due to people dropping out of the workforce altogether. The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of people actively seeking work in addition to those who are working, is significantly lower than it was in 2000. In fact, when you exclude workers 55 or older who may have retired voluntarily, labor force participation is lower now than it was at its worst point during the past two business cycles, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute.A job market where people continue to give up on finding work is part of the reason wage growth has failed to meet expectations, since employers still have little reason to compete for workers, progressive economists argue. Average hourly pay rose 2.5 percent in the 12-month period ending in May, not enough for a significant boost in most Americans’ paychecks.The Fed Up campaign, a coalition of progressive groups that advocates for Fed policy that is favorable to workers and communities of color, cites figures like those when pleading with the Fed to hold off on raising rates. Fed Up has called on the Fed not to raise the benchmark interest rate until ""the economic recovery reaches all communities,"" said Jordan Haedtler, Fed Up campaign manager.Progressives were overjoyed when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton expressed her sympathy with these concerns last month. The campaign said in a statement that as president, Clinton would appoint Fed officials who take seriously the central bank’s mandate to maximize employment, in addition to its duty to tamp down inflation.Clinton stands to benefit politically from Wednesday’s announcement, since voters typically judge the candidate of the incumbent party for the economy's performance. A rate increase would have squeezed economic demand, risking even slower job growth in the months ahead of the general election.Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has expressed a wide variety of views about the Fed. He most recently suggested that he supports low interest rates, but that he plans to replace Yellen as Fed chair.Yellen said Wednesday that the central bank will act based on economic data in the coming months, even if its actions are perceived as affecting the general election in November. ""We are very focused on assessing the economic outlook and making changes that are appropriate without taking politics into account,"" she said.This piece has been updated with Yellen's comments. "

Some see that new proposal as reminiscent of the congressional Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was used for years to halt the influx of Chinese laborers and has been widely considered a black mark on America’s immigration record.But Trump’s overall immigration plan would go beyond that, targeting not just a country or a region of the world but also a religion, something that no modern U.S. president has done.""This is an absurd proposal to build a Fortress America and pull up the drawbridges,” said John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the Bush administration.President Barack Obama took a veiled swipe at Trump on Tuesday, saying such ideas represented a “dangerous” mindset.But U.S. presidents have wide latitude on immigration matters, and some conservative scholars said that the fate of any proposed ban would hinge on how narrowly Trump framed it.They note, for instance, that Democratic President Jimmy Carter barred Iranian nationals from entering the United States during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.“If a Trump administration cut off immigration from certain countries, rather than certain religions, it would not violate the Constitution,” said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California Berkeley and former Justice Department official who advised the George W. Bush administration on interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects.Herman Schwartz, a law professor at American University in Washington, said if Trump stuck to his proposal for a temporary prohibition on Muslim immigrants, that raises significant constitutional questions and ""shows his shaky command of the legal facts.""MUSLIM BANIn Monday’s speech in New Hampshire, Trump showed little sign of scaling back his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which he first laid out in December after an Islamic State-linked deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.Debate over the legality of Trump’s proposals was complicated by the vagueness of his pronouncement and questions on how broadly he would extend any immigration ban if elected.While legal experts say presidents have the power to ban immigrants from specific countries, the United States does not currently ban immigration from any country. Officials do give extra scrutiny to people entering from countries such Syria and Iran.Under the broadest interpretation of Trump’s pronouncement, immigration could be barred not only from the Muslim world but from U.S.-allied countries in Europe and Asia where militant attacks have taken place. This could include India, the source of many skilled engineers for the U.S. technology sector.Critics say this would be impractical and counterproductive.“Is Mr. Trump proposing to stop issuing visas even for business or tourism or education to nationals of certain countries?"" said Bellinger. ""Rather than increase economic growth, Mr. Trump’s plan could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars.”Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump foreign policy adviser, justified the candidate’s pronouncement, saying “it is perfectly appropriate for the country to refuse admission to those whose presence may be detrimental to the national interest.“But Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, when asked whether a president has the authority to ban immigrants based on religion, said: “I’m not sure he does.”Legal experts also raised doubts about the legality of Trump’s demand that members of the American Muslim community “cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad” or else they will be “brought to justice” themselves.” Critics have accused him of anti-Muslim fear-mongering to win votes.“Generally, the idea that knowledge in and of itself comes with criminal liability is antithetical to the way we talk about criminal law in the United States,” said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor.If Trump tried to implement such prosecutions as president, he said, potential defendants could simply invoke their constitutional right against self-incrimination and continue to remain silent.(Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Joan Biskupic and Lawrence Hurley; editing by Stuart Grudgings)"
