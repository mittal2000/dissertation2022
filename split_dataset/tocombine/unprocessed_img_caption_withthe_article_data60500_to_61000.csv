The federal government classification given to the “most dangerous drugs” lumps marijuana in with more serious drugs like heroin, bath salts and LSD, allowing it to be prosecuted aggressively. At around 4:20 p.m. Eastern time, which was chosen because of the number 420’s association with weed, the protesters lit their joints, fired up their bowls and pulled on their vaporizers in unison with little disruption from the Secret Service or the local police. They even inflated a 51-foot plastic inflatable joint with the message “Obama, deschedule cannabis now"" that was made by artists especially for the occasion.Adam Eidinger, a founder of DCMJ and leader of the 2014 campaign to legalize recreational marijuana in the District of Columbia, said that law enforcement initially refused to let the massive inflatable joint into Lafayette Square Park, but they were able to circumvent them by smuggling it in deflated and inflating it in the park.“Just like good stoners everywhere, we snuck in a 51-foot joint, past the Secret Service,” Eidinger joked.Smoking in public remains illegal in the district, despite a November 2014 vote to legalize it. It is illegal on federal land, including Lafayette Square Park and the pedestrian street in front of it, under any circumstances. Eidinger had expected arrests to be made -- even publicly expressing his readiness to be arrested for the cause.But he had not heard of any arrests, he said, though some police citations were issued. The Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department could not immediately be reached to confirm the number of arrests or citations.It was clear, however, that the D.C. cops largely turned a blind eye to public marijuana consumption. Several motorcycle-bound officers provided an escort for the group to march on K Street NW following the protest, during which many demonstrators smoked openly. Peter Tosh’s “Legalize It” cannabis anthem blared from speakers as the parade went forward.The march concluded at the corner of K Street NW and Vermont Avenue, where protest organizers had attacked a mock jail cell to the trailer post of an SUV in protest of the incarceration of marijuana smokers. A sign above the cage-turned-cell said “Jail Is Not A Drug Policy” in big red letters.Obama has the constitutional authority to remove marijuana from Schedule I without the need for congressional approval. Switching it to Schedule III, for example, would allow marijuana businesses in states where the drug is legal to deduct business expenses, and restore access to student loans and public housing for convicted users, among other benefits, according to Ilya Shapiro, a legal scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute.Among the presidential candidates, only Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic contender, has said he would remove marijuana from Schedule I as president. Sanders also introduced a bill in Congress in November that would legalize it completely.Eidinger said that if Hillary Clinton wants to ensure high turnout from Sanders’ supporters in the general election, endorsing the reclassification of marijuana would be a good way to do it.“As a Bernie supporter, I do want to see a united Democratic Party, but you gotta give us something -- this is like in the top three or four issues of Bernie supporters,” Eidinger said, before excusing himself momentarily for a gulp of water.“I’m a little cotton-mouthed, oh my God,” he said.Sanders was clearly the preferred candidate of rally attendees, many of whom sported “Bernie” pins and shirts.Other activists described their involvement in down-ballot races. Zack Pesavento, 29, a veteran of the D.C. legalization campaign, is president of 420 USA Super PAC, a Super PAC dedicated to electing pro-legalization members of Congress. The group has plans to help unseat Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), one of the fiercest opponents in Congress of Washington, D.C.'s attempts to legalize the substance.Sandra, a D.C.-based marijuana grower who was there with her husband, Josh, a certified arborist, said marijuana had been a godsend for her arthritis, sciatica and depression. They had left their two young boys with the kids' grandparents.“The only harm that [legalization] would cause would be to the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies,” she said. “There are so many medications I don’t have to take because I smoke marijuana.”Sandra said she appreciates concerns people have about how marijuana has grown more concentrated over the years -- but to her, it only made the case for legalization more obvious.“We need laws for it so we can regulate... so that people don’t have bad experiences,” she said.This post has been updated to note that the red caps worn by protesters were Phrygian caps, which were used as a symbol of liberty in the French Revolution.

But unfortunately what many so-called Iran policy makers, in the West, do not comprehend is that Iran's domestic and foreign policies are not shaped the same way that those of other modern nation-states' are informed. Iran's domestic and foreign policies are shaped by the interactions and contradictions among three concentric circles of forces, rather than solely by national interests. (I will not delve into these three pillars in this article)Currently, the ruling clerics of Iran are empowered and emboldened to an unprecedented level, where they are launching ballistic missiles, in the midst of the day, for the world to see. I can not imagine that these open, belligerent and provocative actions would have ever happened if the Islamic Republic was still under UNSC sanctions, or if the White House was not following the carrot-but-no-stick policies. The Islamic Republic is publicly acknowledging their IRGC role in helping the Syrian dictator, and publicly galvanizing the Shiite proxies, and giving birth to more Shiite militias, to fuel the sectarian conflict. Americans thought that the US relief of sanctions against the Islamic Republic and the appeasement policies, would definitely generate a favorable reaction from Iranian leaders towards the US. But again, Western politicians appear to be naive in comparison to their Iranian counterparts.  Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, who previously gave his blessing to Rouhani's nuclear team and congratulated them for reaching a nuclear deal with the P5+1, is now turning the trend around after he has achieved his objectives, after IRGC and Khamenei has received billions of dollars, after Iran's ruling politicians witnessed Obama's weakness, and after Khamenei became confident that UNSC sanctions can not be snapped back anymore thanks to Russia and China's veto power in the UN Security Council. In fact, Khamenei appears to be preparing the field to pull out of the nuclear deal, which is President Obama's utmost nightmare. President Obama has shown that he will do anything to maintain the nuclear deal- his foreign policy legacy and ""accomplishment""- intact. In Iran's politics, Obama's concessions and appeasement attitude mean weakness. The more you give the ruling clerics, the more they want and the more they are empowered to pursue their regional hegemonic ambitions. These are basic rules. Elementary reading of Middle Eastern history would tell Iran's policy makers about these basic rules of how politics works in Middle East.Khamenei: ""when I say the enemy, I mean the US government""- Khamenei's Shrewd TacticsIn his hometown of Mashahad, where Khamenei recently gave his yearly speech, he heavily criticized President Rouhani, Iran's foreign foreign minister, Javad Zarif, and he explained that how the United States remains the preeminent enemy of the Islamic Republic. In addition, Khamenei also warned the Iranian youths not to be trapped by President Obama and the White House's last week message to the Iranians. Mockingly, he argued that Obama's latest message and the White House creation of a haft-sin sofreh [the traditional Nowruz food] were methods to deceive the Iranian youth. Khamenei has several tactics with his recent lashing out at Rouhani's and Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif and the United States. The fact is that if it was not for Khamenei's blessing, Rouhani would have not been capable of continuing with the negotiations and reaching the nuclear deal. Even before Rouhani came to power, Khamenei and senior cadre of IRGC were preparing the platform for a nuclear deal. But they are emboldened now, are in a stronger position vis a vis the US after sanctions were lifted, and they do not need the deal anymore after achieving their objectives. In addition, in order to preserve his power, Khamenei has always attempted to play the game of the moderates versus hardliners for the Western viewers. While in public he shows his support for the hardliners, in private he gives the green light to the moderates. In Mashhad, where a significant amount of the hardline clerics reside, Khamenei sends his real message that he continues to respect the Islamic Republic's ideological principles of opposing the United States and preventing rapprochement between Tehran and the ""Great Satan"".In addition, not only does he assure his hardline social base in the Revolutionary Guards, the Basij and the army that he is on their side rather than on the side of moderates, but also he is empowering them to begin controlling the moderates and more freely criticizing Rouhani's team. Third, whenever a president gains popularity, Khamenei attempts to curb the president by empowering hardliners. Fourth, Khamenei's modus of operandi is to avoid any situation that holds him accountable for major issues. On the one hand he gives license to and instructs Rouhani to make a deal, on the other hand he tells the public that this is not what he wanted. Therefore, if Iran pulls out of the nuclear deal or people do not see the fruit of the sanctions relief, they would point fingers to Rouhani. Finally, by criticizing Rouhani, Zarif, and the US, Khamenei seems to be preparing the platform to pull out of the nuclear agreement after sanctions have been lifted._______________Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is an American political scientist, business advisor and the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb939152400003000991236.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One needn't speculate about how the Democrats could end up losing the 2016 presidential election. In fact, a subtly complex, multi-part plan to do just that is exactly what the Democrats have been up to over the last six months.Here's a detailed report on the ten steps the Democrats are now taking to ensure they lose the White House to the Republicans in 2016:1. Assume that Donald Trump will be the Republicans' 2016 nominee, though it's now clear he won't be.Republican pundits agree: Trump will come up short of the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination prior to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Trump will come up short for several reasons: (a) neither Ted Cruz nor John Kasich has any reason to leave the race before Cleveland, and the entirety of their ambition in remaining candidates is to deny delegates to Trump pre-Cleveland; (b) delegates Trump thought he had earned -- in Louisiana, in Tennessee, in South Carolina, and soon enough elsewhere -- are being and will be taken from him pre-Convention via shenanigans coordinated by Ted Cruz's ground operation; (c) Trump is about to lose Wisconsin, and will continue to lose certain smaller and more rural states to Cruz and large pockets of delegates to Kasich in Midwestern and Northeastern states; and (d) there are just too few states left for Trump to clinch before Cleveland, now that his ""win %"" is well over 50% (that is, he has to win well over 50% of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination pre-convention, and in a three-candidate primary he's clearly not been able to do that). In short, there's a reason that FiveThirtyEight.com now says Trump is 5% below where he needs to be to get the nomination outright. And Trump's terrible performance this past week -- with scandals involving his campaign manager allegedly assaulting a female reporter; his retweets of attacks on his opponent's wife; his paradoxical inference that he's simultaneously pro-choice in practice and believes women should be criminally punished for getting abortions; his continued threat to mount an Independent run for President -- will do nothing to change that.Trump has no chance whatsoever to secure the nomination at the Convention itself. Choose your reason: so-called ""faithless"" delegates; delegates who are free to choose whoever they wish after the first ballot; delegates ""for Trump"" who in fact were selected and seated by Cruz or Kasich; backroom Establishment machinations that sway delegates hoping to curry Party favor -- all will conspire to deny the nomination to the man who Washington Post polling indicates would be, at the start of his campaign, one of the most unpopular political candidates in U.S. history.2. Nominate the only person who can reunite the Republican Party once Trump failing to get the nomination has fractured it beyond repair.Hillary Clinton is one of the least popular major-party politicians in America, and her disapproval rating is not just sky-high among Republicans -- we already knew that -- but is in fact a long-time institutional motivator for the entire Republican Party. Nothing unites Republicans quite like hatred of the Clintons. If Trump's supporters are denied seeing their favored candidate win the nomination despite his lead in delegates earned through primaries and caucuses -- and make no mistake, they will be so denied -- their impulse to bolt the Republican Party completely will (and can) only be stopped by a Clinton candidacy.Hillary Clinton is, in short, the only savior the Republican Party has left.So the Democrats are working as hard as they can to nominate her, of course.3. Fracture the Democratic Party by broadly supporting the Clinton camp's attempts to smear Bernie Sanders and his supporters.Three weeks ago, no one was talking about the Democratic race being ""negative."" Then Bernie Sanders starting winning more Election Day votes than Clinton, started cutting into her delegate lead, and started developing the sort of momentum that could lead to catastrophic electoral results for Clinton in the latter half of the election season. After winning 60% of the delegates in February, Clinton won only 51% of them in March, and is now set to lose the first two votes on April (Wisconsin and Wyoming). The frustration in her camp is palpable, and recently was seen on the face of the candidate herself while reprimanding a Sanders supporter during a public rally.So the Clinton camp -- with the help of the media and cable-news interviews (as well as newspaper editorials) by Party elites -- changed the narrative.Clinton campaign staff put out the conspiracy theory that Sanders was planning (I paraphrase) ""a massive negative attack campaign"" in New York, based solely on internal polls taken by Sanders to determine which issues New York voters are most interested in hearing the candidates discuss. Clinton supporters Barney Frank and Bakari Sellers accused Sanders of being a ""McCarthyite"" -- comparison to the late Senator Joe McCarthy being one of the most damning slanders in American politics -- for noting that oil lobbyists were bundling money for the Clinton campaign and for her super-PAC. The Clinton camp accused the Sanders campaign of ""playing games"" with the scheduling of a primary debate in New York. They said Sanders was deliberately permitting his supporters to boo Clinton at his rallies. They attacked his surrogates for mentioning, in passing, the FBI investigation into Clinton's private email server. They accused the Sanders campaign of ""lying"" about Clinton's record. They accused Sanders of a secret and anti-democratic plan to convince super-delegates to vote the same way as their states of origin did (and if you can explain to me how that's either a secret plan or anti-democratic, I'd appreciate it). They falsely claimed that Sanders hadn't sufficiently rebuked Donald Trump for his comments about criminalizing abortion.And on and on.Every day for the past two weeks the Clinton campaign has attacked the ethics and integrity of Sanders and his campaign, usually by falsely claiming that Sanders -- for instance, by broadly and on principle opposing super-PACs and money from lobbyists, no matter who their money goes to -- was maliciously doing the same to them.In short, the Clinton campaign went relentlessly negative and managed to get the national media to accuse the Sanders campaign of doing so -- a premise set up by a Clinton campaign memo leaked to the media alleging that Sanders ""was about to go negative"" in New York. It was Karl-Rovian political philosophy at its very best, and it worked for the Clinton campaign -- but not in the way they intended.With each new attack on Sanders, the Clinton campaign has permanently alienated a new crop of Sanders voters. 33 percent of Sanders supporters already say that they might not vote for Clinton; so by going negative and so relentlessly, the Clinton campaign is tearing up potential November votes for their candidate by the tens of thousands or more.4. Fatally underestimate the electoral chances of the two men now most likely to be the Republican presidential nominee in November: Ted Cruz and John Kasich.According to RealClearPolitics, one of the nation's top polling aggregators, John Kasich has beaten Hillary Clinton in every single head-to-head poll taken in 2016. Across ten polls, Kasich beats Clinton by an average of more than six points. To put this in perspective, the last time Clinton defeated Kasich in a head-to-head poll was more than seven months ago.The Cruz-Clinton polling is more mixed -- and yet, somehow, every bit as troubling. Between August of 2013 and August of 2015, Hillary Clinton beat Ted Cruz in every single head-to-head poll. And there were a lot of them: 37, to be exact. But then something happened; after a brief hiatus from Cruz-Clinton polls, pollsters again began testing that matchup in November of 2015. This times, the results were dramatically different.Now, Cruz beats Clinton 31% of the time, ties her 14% of the time, and loses to her 55% of the time. The last seven polls show the two in a statistical tie -- Clinton leads narrowly, but well within the polls' margin of error.It would be an impressive showing for Clinton if Cruz were an impressive candidate.In fact, Ted Cruz is one of the least popular politicians in America, indeed one of the least popular major-party candidates of the last few election cycles. His average favorability-unfavorability rating is -17.6, though this figure is aided enormously by a single outlier poll that found a -6 rating. Take that outlier out of the equation, and Cruz is underwater to the tune of -19.2 points in recent polling.Clinton supporters say that general election polling isn't accurate in April. Unfortunately, we know from hard data that that's not correct. In fact, according to studies, we're right in the middle of a spike in general-election polling accuracy -- right now, as in this minute. As Vox notes, ""By the time we get to mid-April of an election year, polls explain about half the variance in the eventual vote split. And mid-April polls have correctly 'called' the winner in about two-thirds of the cases since 1952.""5. Fail to nominate their most popular candidate, in particular the one with the best chance of beating Ted Cruz or John Kasich in the fall.In 2016, Clinton's favorability-unfavorability rating has been checked by pollsters twenty times. Clinton's hasn't been viewed favorably by a majority of respondents even once. More than that, her negative score has been in double-digits 85 percent of the time (and one of the three times it wasn't, it was -9). The problem here -- or, rather, another problem -- is that the RealClearPolitics history shows that Clinton only becomes more unpopular the more hotly contested an election is, and as many pundits have noted, the Clinton-Sanders race has generated sufficient heat that Clinton may struggle to win over a significant percentage of Sanders voters should she win the nomination. If she wins the nomination with super-delegates, rather than clinching it via pledged delegates alone, that discontent within the party will be larger still.Meanwhile, Sanders consistently beats every Republican candidate -- including Cruz and Kasich -- by more than Clinton, not just nationally but in battleground-state polling. Democrats have thus far disregarded this polling both because of a specious argument from the Clinton camp (general-election polling means nothing unless it tells a good story for Secretary Clinton) and a dangerous assumption originating from the same source (that Trump will definitely be the GOP nominee, and because anyone could beat Trump in November, it hardly matters who the Democrats nominate).John Kasich is substantially more popular than Hillary Clinton nationally, but less popular than Bernie Sanders. So how does a Clinton-Kasich general-election battle sound to you, Democrats? 6. Freeze one of the most popular Democrats nationally, Bernie Sanders, out of the picture altogether.  In 2008, when Hillary Clinton lost a hotly contested presidential nominating contest to Barack Obama, she was rewarded with the second-most powerful executive position in the U.S. government: Secretary of State.In 2016, the Clinton camp, determined to offend Sanders and his supporters, has leaked that if he continues to do well -- winning about half the delegates in the primary season post-March 1st -- they'll consider giving him a good speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. They may even, if he's really good and plays really nice with everyone, let him chat with Secretary Clinton a few times about his priorities and maybe (if he's lucky!) get her to adopt one or two of his positions that, in fact, she already has adopted-cum-stole via her largely plagiarized-from-Bernie stump speeches.What? No Cabinet-level position, just a nice speaking slot on TV? When Bernie's been on TV more over the past six months than he was in the twenty-five years prior?Yes, it's true: the Clinton campaign is throwing maximum shade at Bernie regarding his future in the Party, and in the most condescending way possible.They've even gone so far as to leak possible VP candidates for Clinton -- Cory Booker; Julian Castro -- just to be certain that Sanders supporters know that neither Sanders nor his closest ally in Congress, Elizabeth Warren, will have any place whatsoever in a second (or rather third) Clinton Administration.By freezing Sanders and his platform out of the Democratic Party altogether, it ensures that not only will Clinton lose many Sanders supporters -- which will already happen pursuant to step #5 of the Democrats plan to lose the White House -- but also that she will lose most or all of the independent voters that Sanders has thus far been winning over her by 30 to 40 points. Indeed, Clinton has done everything she can do to signal that neither Sanders' views nor his supporters will have any place in her Administration should she win the White House -- which callous disregard of the Democratic base substantially decreases her chances of ever occupying that building.7. Reject Sanders' call for a fifty-state general-election campaign.If John Kasich is the Republican nominee, the entire Midwest -- especially Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Indiana -- will be up for grabs in the fall. Given Clinton's weak standing relative to Kasich in national and state head-to-head polling, if Kasich is the GOP nominee the Democrats will need to have a plan to pick up states they would not normally contest.Polling suggests that Bernie Sanders could expand the Democratic map by bringing either into play for the first time or more firmly into the Democratic camp certain purple or even red states -- Kansas, Missouri, Utah, Alaska, New Hampshire, Michigan -- that Clinton might well lose in November should she be the Democratic nominee. But nothing in the demeanor or public statements of the Clinton campaign suggests that it has a plan to make its candidate -- already one of the most unpopular Democrats in the nation -- into a candidate who could win over independents or beat a relatively moderate Republican like John Kasich in battleground states.Sanders has made clear that the Democrats will need, in 2016, a movement of the sort they had in 2008 when President Obama first ran for national office. He has said explicitly that a fifty-state strategy is needed, one that acknowledges that independent voters and even moderate Republicans are persuadable in a situation in which the GOP has tacked hard to the right in recent years. If Clinton is nominated by the Democrats, the Democrats will approach the national electoral map the same way Al Gore did in 2000, and that simply won't cut it. And it shouldn't cut it -- as a general-election campaign that starts out with little hope of or interest in winning over independents, indeed whose only plan to win over independents is to have the other party nominate its worst imaginable candidate, is almost destined to lose on Election Day.8. Do nothing whatsoever to address outstanding concerns about the character, integrity, and judgment of the Party's front-runner.Clinton has refused to release her Wall Street speeches when she could easily do so, making it look like she has something to hide. Clinton has refused to clearly articulate any mistakes she might have made with respect to her private email server, making it look like she exercises bad judgment and then has no ability or willingness to self-analyze or admit error -- precisely the quality so many people find unnerving in Donald Trump. Clinton has refused to reign in her out-of-control husband -- and I'm speaking only in political terms here -- who helped her lose in 2008 with ill-considered analogies between Barack Obama and Jesse Jackson and is now going around the country saying that Obama's economy has left many people out (adding too that he won't recuse himself from casting a super-delegate vote for his own wife). Clinton has refused to distance herself from the Clinton Foundation, despite the bad press it's gotten for the myriad conflicts of interest necessarily involved in its fundraising efforts. Despite saying that oil money makes up an infinitesimal percentage of her fundraising, Clinton has refused to just let that money go and make the same pledge to forego it that Sanders has. Clinton has routinely slipped into the same sleazy politico-speak -- accusing Sanders of ""voting against"" the auto bail-out when he didn't; accusing Sanders of condoning Trump's anti-women comments when he hasn't; trying to set up primary debates for dates and times no one could possibly be watching -- that's made her so unpopular nationally.In short, Hillary Clinton appears to blame everyone but herself for the lack of trust the American people have in her. That's a bad look for any politician, both because it ignores the concerns of voters and, moreover, suggests a candidate incapable of personal and political growth. There are many things the Clinton camp could be doing now to rehabilitate her image for the general election, and they're doing absolutely none of them.9. Over-rely on the national media to set the political narrative for the campaign season, further alienating voters who want to vote for a candidate with vision.From the jump, the Clinton campaign should have distanced itself from the whole ""super-delegate"" component of the presidential election season, as voters rightly see super-delegates as anti-democratic and singularly non-responsive to the Democratic base. Instead, the Clintons reveled in the day-in, day-out media reports that wrongly assigned her super-delegates as part of her delegate count. This rightly infuriated Sanders supporters. Clinton could have said, ""Don't include those delegates because they haven't voted yet; and besides, I plan to win in the pledged delegate battle"" -- but she never did.Clinton used media cover to evade substantial criticism for participating in so few debates, and for the debates that were held being held at such inconvenient -- sometimes downright strange -- dates and times.Clinton waited to see which Sanders' policy positions were most popular among the media and among voters before adopting these positions herself.Clinton sat back and let the media focus primarily on Trump, because she thought that doing so would emphasize that, on the Democratic side, the front-runner's eventual nomination was a near-certainty. This made the Republican contest the focal point of American political discourse month after month -- a lack of media coverage that hurt Democratic turnout in caucuses and, more generally, made the Democratic Party seem less energetic than the Republicans. Using behind-the-scenes machinations to sweep out of her way any Democratic candidates besides (in addition to Sanders) Jim Webb, Martin O'Malley, and Lincoln Chafee -- three deeply underwhelming individuals -- didn't help, as it made the Democratic bench seem far, far more shallow than it actually is. If you're wondering why Clinton's only credible competition is an Independent (Sanders), you really don't understand how the Clintons do things.And now Clinton continues to buy the media hype that she's far more popular than Sanders and beating him handily, even though her campaign has basically been a disaster since March 1st. She and her team have missed the important particulars of the Sanders' comeback -- both its specific contours and what it portends more generally -- only and precisely because the national media has missed it, too.And on and on.The problem is that Clinton had so routinely used favorable media coverage as a crutch that it has weakened -- if not stopped in its tracks -- her ability to improve as a candidate or raise the profile of the Democratic ""brand"" more generally. Nor has it prepared her to understand how and why so many Democrats are angry at the media right now, and with a fervor usually reserved for Republican ire about ""left-wing bias."" When the media turns on Clinton in the fall -- should she be the nominee -- it will be entirely predictable, as the media benefits when a general-election race is as close as possible. And Clinton simply won't be prepared for it. Nor will the Democrats, who will have done insufficient work setting the terms of the national political discourse for the media, rather than the other way around.10. Ignore the youth vote.More Millennials have a favorable opinion of socialism than capitalism, and they're voting for Sanders over Clinton by approximately a 50-point margin. Clinton's only response is empty political rhetoric: ""You may not be supporting me, but I'm supporting you!"" That's not just empty talk -- it's patronizing. Millennials don't want someone from their grandparents' generation saying, ""I'm supporting you!"", nor do they even just wanted to be listened to -- in fact, they want their values to be reflected, and sincerely so, in the politicians for whom they vote.Hillary Clinton doesn't share the values or vision for America of the generation that will steer the Democratic Party for the next half-century, and shows no interest in doing so. That spells doom for the Party long-term -- possibly even its devolution or dissolution in the next few election cycles, as we're seeing with the Republican Party now. And it's entirely avoidable. In fact, Bernie Sanders is not so much what the Clintons see him as -- a pest -- as the writing on the wall telling the Democratic Leadership Council and its ilk that their days are numbered, and that if they don't pivot into the America we all live in, rather than merely the America they and their friends inhabit, the Democratic Party will ultimately cease to exist.In sum, the Democrats are flawlessly executing a complex plan to lose the 2016 presidential election, slowly dismantle their own party apparatus, and become irrelevant in the next ten years.Congratulations to them.And, given what we're seeing now on the GOP side, God help the rest of us.Seth Abramson is the Series Editor for Best American Experimental Writing (Wesleyan University) and the author, most recently, of DATA (BlazeVOX, 2016)."

Lines to vote snaked around corners of buildings in Arizona, while thousands were blocked from voting in North Carolina for not having the proper identification to vote, a product of misinformation over the state's new voter ID law.If Congress needed any more evidence to suggest that the Voting Rights Act (VRA) must be restored, they got it in the Arizona and North Carolina elections. What happened in these states underscores the destructive nature of the Supreme Court's decision to gut the VRA three years ago. That ruling struck down a provision requiring states with historic records of discrimination to undergo preclearance review of any proposed changes to their elections law.Just last week in Maricopa County, Arizonans attempting to vote were met with excessively long lines because the number of polling places was reduced by nearly 70 percent. In comparison to 2012, when there were 200 polling places, this year there were just 60--one polling place for every 21,000 voters in the county. The Nation magazine reports that the last voter in the state cast their ballot at 12:12 a.m. after standing in line for five hours.Election officials claim the decision to reduce the number of polling places was made to save money. But, as Ari Berman notes, before the Supreme Court struck down the preclearance requirement, the decision to close polls would have been subject to federal review. Maricopa County officials would have likely been questioned about its impact on voters, especially in communities of color.The consequences of the Supreme Court's decision are not limited to Arizona. Just before it held its primary contest, 218,000 voters in North Carolina were barred from voting because of that state's voter identification law. The law was passed just a month after the high court's decision.Many of those turned away were college students. From ThinkProgress:Early voting offered a glimpse of the problems that will arise on Tuesday--during the past ten days of early voting, many college students were blocked from the polls. North Carolina's WRAL reported that 864 people across the state had cast provisional early ballots because they did not have acceptable forms of ID, and four of the five counties with the highest concentrations of provisional ballots from voters without ID were in places with college campuses.As the primary campaign turns to the general, we can surely expect to see more consequences of a weakened Voting Rights Act at play.To ensure the integrity of the upcoming election -- one that is indisputably critical -- Congress has a responsibility to expeditiously reauthorize the Voting Rights Act to strengthen voter protections with additional safeguards that reflect the country's current demographic changes. A new Voting Rights Act will strengthen and improve our republic.This was first posted to the NCLR Blog."

But they have a record whenever industrial pollutants are involved. Look at the Journal's commentary on acid rain, on the ozone layer, and on climate change. There is a pattern: Deny the science, question the motives, exaggerate the costs, help the polluters. When they are wrong this often, but keep at it, you have to wonder whether they care about whether they're right or wrong, or whether they are performing some other service.  In the 1970s, scientists first warned that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), then commonly used as refrigerants and aerosol propellants, could erode the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer and increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays, causing cancer. The Journal's editorial page doggedly fought back, devaluing the science and attacking any regulation of CFCs. January 1976: an editorial proclaimed that the connection between CFCs and ozone depletion ""is only a theory and will remain only that until further efforts are made to test its validity in the atmosphere itself."" May 1979: an editorial said that ""it now appears the excitement over the threat to the ozone layer was founded on scanty scientific evidence."" March 1984: the editorial page claimed that concerns about ozone depletion were based on ""premature scientific evidence,"" that ""new evidence shows that the ozone layer isn't vanishing after all; it may even be increasing."" March 1989: an editorial called for more research on the ""questionable theory that CFCs cause depletion of the ozone layer,"" and implored scientists to ""continue to study the sky until we know enough to make a sound decision regarding the phasing out of our best refrigerants."" They attacked the motives of reformers. A February 1992 editorial insinuated: ""It is simply not clear to us that real science drives policy in this area."" And they warned that action to slow ozone depletion would be costly...  A March 1984 editorial claimed that banning CFCs would ""cost the economy some $1.52 billion in forgone profits and product-change expenses"" as well as 8,700 jobs. An August 1990 editorial warned of ""a dramatic increase in air-conditioning and refrigeration costs."" Media Matters reports the Journal also claimed ""the economy will have to shoulder at least $10 billion to $15 billion a year in added refrigeration costs by the year 2000."" A February 1992 editorial warned of ""big price increases on many consumer products."" Despite this, Americans actually listened to the science. Congress took action, the ozone layer and the public's health were protected, and the economy prospered. What about those terrible costs that the Journal predicted? According to the EPA's 1999 progress report, ""Every dollar invested in ozone protection provides $20 of societal health benefits in the United States."" One dollar spent, twenty dollars saved. When scientists began reporting that acid rain was falling on most of our Northeastern United States, similarly, out came the Journal again: saying ""data are not conclusive and more studies are needed""; arguing that ""nature, not industry, is the primary source of acid rain""; claiming ""the scientific case for acid rain is dying""; and charging ""that politics, not nature, is the primary force driving the theory's biggest boosters""; all even as President Reagan's own scientific panel said that inaction would risk ""irreversible damage."" Now let's review the Journal on climate change. June 1993: they claimed ""growing evidence that global warming just isn't happening."" September 1999: the page reported that ""serious scientists"" call global warming ""one of the greatest hoaxes of all time."" June 2005: they asserted that the link between fossil fuels and global warming had ""become even more doubtful."" As late as December 2011, an editorial said that the global warming debate requires ""more definitive evidence."" The Journal polluter playbook produced the usual warnings that ""a high CO2 tax would reduce world GDP a staggering 12.9 percent in 2100 -- the equivalent of $40 trillion a year,"" making ""the world poorer than it would otherwise be""; that this was all really motivated by ""political actors"" seeking to gain economic control; and that the science wasn't clear, that ""global surface temperatures have remained essentially flat."" Here's a real beauty: A December 2009 Journal editorial claimed that climate scientists were suspect because they ""have been on the receiving end of climate change-related funding, so all of them must believe in the reality (and catastrophic imminence) of global warming just as a priest must believe in the existence of God."" If it is a conflict of interest to be ""on the receiving end"" of scientific funding ""related"" to the field of inquiry, that would make all science not discovered by surprise a conflict of interest. Of course, if science is itself a conflict of interest, that neatly moots the real conflict of interest of the science-denial machinery designed to masquerade as science but come up with industry-friendly results.There is such machinery, according to numerous investigative books, journalists' reporting, and academic studies. I won't belabor this here, but look at the work of Professors Naomi Oreskes at Harvard University, Robert Brulle at Drexel University, Riley Dunlap at Oklahoma State University, and Justin Farrell at Yale University, or the work of investigative reporter Jane Mayer, among many others. Which brings us to the Journal's question, ""Why even raise the possibility of RICO suits -- and suggest it to the Justice Department -- if Mr. Whitehouse's goal isn't to punish those who disagree with him on climate?"" One reason is that such a suit by the Department of Justice under the Clinton and Bush administrations was successful against the fraudulent industry enterprise to sow false doubt about tobacco's dangers (before the RICO suit was won by DOJ, the Journal had called it ""abuse,"" ""hypocrisy,"" and ""a shakedown""). So there's the little matter of this being the law. A second reason is that if there is indeed a core of deliberate fraud at the heart of the climate denial enterprise, no industry should be big enough to suppress investigation of that fraud. Most of the writers I mentioned note similarities between the tobacco fraud scheme and the climate denial operation, as has the lawyer who won the tobacco lawsuit for DOJ; as apparently have more than a dozen state Attorneys General. Climate skeptics -- people who ""disagree"" with me on the reality of climate change -- are not the targets of such an investigation, any more than smokers or people who ""disagreed"" with the Surgeon General were targets of the tobacco case. Those folks may very well be victims of the fraud, the dupes. Fraud investigations punish those who lie, knowing that they are lying, intending to fool others, and do it for money. No one should be too big to answer for that conduct. This is an important difference, and it's the difference I'm talking about when I say the Wall Street Journal editorial page is trying to saddle me with an argument I'm not making because they don't have a good response to the one I am. Frankly, all this makes it look like they are out to protect the fraudsters, by misleading regular people about what such a lawsuit would do and continuing their long tradition of downplaying or denying scientists' warnings about the harms of industries' products."

They should be ashamed.",2016-04-03,"ROTHSCHILD, WI - APRIL 2: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at the Central Wisconsin Convention and Expo Center in Rothschild, WI on Saturday April 02, 2016.

Trump asserted that, if abortion were once again made a crime, women who have abortions should be punished. Trump was simply being logical. It is standard practice under the criminal law that a person who commits a crime, who conspires with others to commit a crime, or who pays others to commit a crime, is guilty of a crime. In simplest form, if X pays Y to kill Z, X is guilty of a crime. Trump was just extending that common-sense rule to the context of abortion.That pro-choice groups vehemently attacked Trump's assertion was predictable and understandable, because they are committed to the view that women have a fundamental personal and constitutional right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. What was puzzling, though, is that he was also vehemently attacked by the anti-abortion forces and by members of the Christian Right.  This is puzzling because if abortion is murder of a human life then it logically follows, as Trump suggested, that the woman is guilty of a crime when she is complicit in murdering her unborn child. Why then did the anti-abortion forces attack Trump?One possible explanation for the seeming inconsistency among the anti-abortion forces is that they are simply political hypocrites. They condemn abortion, but not to the extent of having the courage or consistency of their convictions. But there is another, and even more disturbing, explanation. This alternative explanation was evident in Trump's revised position, in which he declared that the woman who has an abortion should not be punished because she ""is a victim."" Ted Cruz echoed this same explanation, as did Dr. Ben Carson, who explained: ""The woman is the victim. She's traumatized emotionally and in many other ways that's problematic. In terms of who should be punished, that women has already been punished."" The point, in other words, is that the woman who has an abortion should not be punished because she has suffered enough. But would they say this about a woman who pays someone to kill her four-month-old child? I rather doubt it. To understand where this rather perverse notion comes from, a little history may be enlightening.In England in the centuries before the founding of the American nation, abortion was legal as long as it took place before quickening (when the mother first feels fetal movement in her uterus), which typically occurs at around eighteen weeks, or roughly halfway through a pregnancy. The prevailing view was that the fetus was not ""ensouled"" until quickening. As the great English scholar William Blackstone observed in 1765, human life ""begins in contemplation of law"" only after the ""infant is able to stir"" in the woman's womb.   After the Revolution, the American states universally adopted this position, and abortion was legal in the United States at any time prior to quickening. Through the middle of the Nineteenth Century, abortifacients were widely available from mail-order firms and pharmacists, several generally available books offered instruction on how to terminate a pregnancy, and daily newspapers regularly ran ads for products that promised to ""cure"" pregnancy - a euphemism for terminating a pregnancy. By the 1870s, approximately twenty percent of all pregnancies were purposefully terminated. But then the moralists moved in. During the evangelical fervor of the Second Great Awakening in the 1830s, Protestant understandings of the fetus began to change. Abandoning the traditional view, evangelicals now preached that a separate and distinct life came into being at the instant of conception.This shift in religious perspective was reinforced by the conclusion of some medical professionals, based partly on religion and partly on science, that life begins at conception. In 1839, for example, Dr. Hugh Lenox Hodge published a pamphlet in which he confidently asserted that embryos could think and could perceive right and wrong.The most influential voice in this transformation was that of the Boston gynecologist Horatio Storer, who published a highly influential essay in 1865 titled Why Not? A Book for Every Woman. In this essay, Storer made essentially two arguments against abortion. First, he maintained that ""the fetus in utero is alive from the very moment of conception,"" and that it therefore followed that for a woman ""to extinguish the first spark of life is a crime of the same nature, both against our Maker and society, as to destroy an infant, a child, or a man.""  Second, Storer argued that abortion is ""a thousand times more dangerous"" to the woman than childbirth. He maintained that many women who have an abortion ""become confirmed invalids, perhaps for life,"" and develop ""serious and often fatal organic disease."" Some die, either immediately or later, as a result of ""moral shock from the thought of the crime,"" whereas others, he declared, are driven to insanity. Storer emphatically rejected the proposition that the woman should be able to decide this question for herself, noting that if she were given this responsibility ""her decision . . . would be . . . warped by personal considerations,"" particularly because, during pregnancy, ""woman's mind is prone to depression, and, indeed, to temporary actual derangement, under the stimulus of uterine excitement.""  Influenced by the combination of religious and pseudo-medical positions, by the dawn of the Twentieth Century, every state had enacted legislation absolutely prohibiting abortion from the very moment of conception unless a doctor certified that it was necessary to save the life of the woman. Despite these laws, as many as two million women still had abortions each year, and almost a third of all pregnancies ended in abortion. But because of these laws, these abortions now had to be performed illegally, in less safe circumstances, and by less reliable practitioners than in the past. The era of the ""back-alley"" abortion had been born.The point of this bit of history is that it explains why the anti-abortion forces insist that, even if abortion were illegal, women who have abortions should not be criminally punished. It is because, as Ben Carson, echoing Horatio Storer, explained, when a woman has an abortion, she is a victim. She is so ""traumatized emotionally"" that there is no need for any further punishment. This view of the anti-abortion forces is horrifically paternalistic, insulting and demeaning to women. It is based on the perverted premise that every woman who chooses to have an abortion is making a decision based inescapably on ""temporary mental derangement"" and will suffer dire emotional, psychological, and sexual trauma for the rest of her life.The best answer to this patronizing way of thinking was offered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court's 2006 decision in Gonzales v. Carhart, in which the Court, in a five-to-four, decision, upheld the constitutionality of a law forbidding so-called partial-birth abortion. In his majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy suggested, without any evidence, that women who have abortions have a fragile emotional state, come to regret their choices, and suffer from ""severe depression and loss of esteem.""A furious Justice Ginsburg responded that this was ""an antiabortion shibboleth"" which had no support in reality. ""This way of thinking,"" Ginsburg charged, ""reflects ancient notions about women's place in the family--ideas that have long been discredited."" Ginsburg concluded that, though the majority ""may regard women's feelings on the matter as self-evident,"" the Court has repeatedly confirmed over the years that ""the destiny of the woman must be shaped by her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.""What is most offensive about the Trump, Cruz, Carson, anti-abortion contention that women who have abortions are ""victims"" is that it is profoundly dishonest and insulting to the dignity and integrity of women. They should be ashamed."

That's because it was the site of Nazi rallies and a Nazi youth camp during the 1930s.In fact, the park's real name is Crescenta Valley County Park and it is owned and operated by Los Angeles County. The new sign was erected last month, on the western edge of the park, by the Tricentennial Foundation, a German heritage organization based in the North Hills section of Los Angeles. The foundation did not erect the sign to remind local residents of the park's horrifying history, but instead, to ""preserve the historical integrity of the site,"" Hans Eberhard, the foundation's chairman, told the Glendale News-Press.I'm a German American and, like many others residents of Los Angeles County, whose tax dollars pay for the park, I find the new sign offensive, not simply because it honors Paul von Hindenburg (a World War One hero and Germany's president from 1925 to 1934 who appointed Adolf Hitler as German chancellor in 1933) but because it obscures the site's ugly past. My family, on my father's side, left Germany and arrived in the United States in the 1860s. But they identified more as Jews than as Germans because of the anti-Semitism they were escaping in their native country. My mother's side of the family left Poland and Lithuania in the 1880s to flee the wave of vicious and violent anti-Jewish pogroms, but they left friends and relatives behind who were later among the six millions Jews murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. My father served in the army in World War Two and lost many friends in battles to rid the world of Hitler and the scourge of German fascism. Many local residents, led by the Jewish Federation of the Greater San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys, are demanding that the County remove the sign. The park is located in the district of Supervisor Michael Antonovich, one of five members of the Board of Supervisors that governs sprawling LA County, the nation's largest county with over 10 million residents. It was under Antonovich's watch last year that the County Department of Parks and Recreation allowed the Tricentennial Foundation to erect the 6-foot high sign at the park's entrance near the corner of Honolulu and Dunsmore avenues. Visitors are greeted with the sign that reads ""Willkommen zum,"" followed by ""Welcome to Hindenburg Park,"" and below that ""The Historic German Section of Crescenta Valley Park."" At the bottom of the sign are the county's official seal and the words ""Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation.""Despite the official seal, the county did not pay for the sign, which cost $2,500, according to Kaye Michelson, the department's acting public information officer. She explained that the Tricentennial Foundation worked with the Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Historical Society of Crescenta Valley and the Crescenta Valley Town Council to fund the sign.Had these organizations -- or Supervisor Antonovich's office -- done their research, they might have predicted that the sign would generate controversy, given the park's history as a gathering place for American Nazis and Nazi sympathizers.Some proponents of the sign argue that they heard no objections about it before the County approved it. ""That's because hardly anyone knew about it until it was put up,"" explained Jason Moss, executive director of the Jewish Federation. ""If it had been a public process, I'm sure people would have opposed it. Now that it's up there, we're voicing our concerns.""An article about the new sign in the Crescenta Valley Weekly last month made no mention of the Nazi rallies held at the park. German-American Bund leader Fritz Kuhn speaking at pro-Nazi rally in Hindenburg Park, April 1939But after several local residents brought the issue to Moss' attention, what appeared to be a harmless historical marker became the subject of controversy. Moss and others brought their complaints to Antonovich, who tried to deflect criticism by referring them to the County Department of Parks and Recreation. ""I think there's a way we can honor German-American culture, but also not forget what took place at that park,"" Moss told me.In response to the complaints, the county's Human Relations Commission will hold a public hearing on Thursday, April 7, from 4-6 pm, at the Sparr Heights Senior Center, 1613 Glencoe Way, Glendale, CA 91208. The hearing officers will report back to the full commission, who will then make a recommendation to County Parks Department, which could then decide what to do. But ultimately it will depend on whether Antonovich -- who has served in that post since 1980 and has a reputation for closely monitoring activities in his district -- insists that the sign be removed. The sign's opponents are urging people to contact Sussy Nemer, a staffperson for Antonovich (Snemer@lacbos.org) to voice their views about the sign.The controversy over the sign offers a teachable moment about local history and about the dangers of ignoring bigotry in our midst. As the cliché goes, if we don't learn from the past, we're doomed to repeat it.In 1925 the German American League acquired the land, named it Hindenburg Park, and maintained it as a private gathering for local German Americans, who held dances, picnics and other events there. Had the park simply been a place where German Americans celebrated their rich and fascinating cultural heritage, it would hardly be contentious. But the site also has a much more troubling history.Although the German American League may have been founded to celebrate German culture, it always had a political side. According to a 1937 article in Life magazine, the group was ""the Nazi organization in the U.S.,"" previously known as the Friends of the New Germany.This country's major pro-Nazi group was the German-American Bund, which sought to promote a favorable view of Nazi Germany and urged Americans to boycott Jewish-owned business. Its rallies not only featured Nazi flags but also American flags, claiming that its members were patriotic Americans. In fact, the Bund claimed that George Washington was ""the first Fascist."" As early as 1936, the Bund operated 19 Nazi-inspired youth camps across the United States. One of them was called Camp Sutter and it was located at the German-American League's Hindenburg Park. I spoke with Arnie Bernstein, author of the 2013 book Swastika Nation: Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund. He explained that the purpose of these Bund youth camps was to ""indoctrinate children in Nazi ideology."" Like most summer camps, the children participated in sports, hikes, arts and crafts and other activities. But they also were taught about Aryan supremacy and told to be loyal to the Bund, its leader Fritz Kuhn, and Adolph Hitler. They wore uniforms similar to those worn by the Hitler Youth group in Germany. They were forced to march around in the middle of the night carrying Bund and American flags, sing the Nazi anthem, give the Nazi salute, and shout ""Sieg Heil"" said Bernstein. As part of their camp activities, they were inculcated with Nazi propaganda. A Congressional investigation also uncovered sexual abuse between the adults and campers, Bernstein said   German-American Bund choir in Hindenburg Park; Bund members marching in the parkIn February 1939, Kuhn, who was often called the ""American Fuehrer,"" spoke at a pro-Nazi Bund rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City that attracted over 20,000 people. There he repeatedly referred to President Franklin D. Roosevelt as ""Frank D. Rosenfeld,"" called his New Deal the ""Jew Deal,"" and stated that ""the Jews are enemies of the United States."" Another rally was held that month at the Bund's West Coast headquarters at 634 West 15th Street in Los Angeles in building known as the Deutsch Haus (German House). The building was a site for pro-Nazi meetings and also housed a restaurant and beer hall as well as the Aryan Bookstore, where one could purchase the Bund newspaper, Hitler's manifesto Mein Kamp, and other Nazi literature. The Deutsch Haus also screened German anti-Semitic propaganda films with titles like ""Kosher Slaughter."" A few months later, on April 30, 1939, the Bund held a rally in Hindenburg Park, promoted as a celebration of Hitler's birthday ten days later. Over 2,000 German-American Bund members came to hear Kuhn and West Coast Bund leader Herman Max Schwinn. According to the Los Angeles Times: ""Clad in a gray-and-black storm trooper uniform and flanked by a dozen uniformed guards, Kuhn spoke from a stage draped in red swastika banners."" The crowd cheered Kuhn and booed as a low-flying plane, sponsored by the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, bombarded the park with thousands of anti-Hitler leaflets.When it was Schwimm's turn to speak, he read a telegram he had sent to President Franklin D. Roosevelt: ""Do everything in your power to quarantine the United States against alien influences which are at work to drag the nation into war."" By ""alien influences"" he meant Jews, whom the Bund correctly believed were trying to get the Roosevelt administration and Congress to oppose Hitler's efforts to take over Europe.A two-minute clip from the documentary film ""Rancho La Canada"" includes footage of activities at Hindenburg Park, including that 1939 Nazi rally. Some of the rally's organizers were later put on trial for sedition.In an interview with the Los Angeles Times that week, Kuhn spouted typical Nazi ideas. Jews, he claimed 62% of the high posts in the federal government and ""have plotted to get hold of almost everything, especially in New York and Hollywood."" That event was only one of many Bund and pro-Nazi events that took place at the park. These gatherings featured speakers from other American fascist organizations - including the Silver Shirts, White Shirts, and Khaki Shirts -- as well as the Bund. Cal State-Northridge hosts a website and archive called ""In Our Own Backyard: Resisting Nazi Propaganda in Southern California, 1933-1945"" that includes photos of Nazi rallies at Hindenburg Park. One shows members of the Bund erecting a huge swastika in the park. In December 1939, Fritz Kuhn was sentenced to two and a half to five years in prison for embezzlement, but the Bund briefly continued without him. Two years later, after the United States entered World War 2 against the Nazis, the Bund disappeared. In 1943, while he was serving his prison sentence, the U.S. cancelled Kuhn's citizenship and deported him to Germany in 1945. After the war, Hindenburg Park continued to be the site for German festivals. Southern California's first Oktoberfest was held there in 1956. While the German American League owned the park, a 5-foot bust of Hindenburg adorned the grounds. In 1957, Los Angeles County purchased the land from the German-American League for $91,000, and removed the bust. The Board of Supervisors also abandoned the name Hindenburg Park and incorporated that section of the park into the larger Crescenta Valley County Park.  A Swatstika sign in Hindenburg Park in the 1930s; the German American League erected this statue of German President Paul von Hindenburg in the park they named for himOver the next half-century, memories of the American Nazis' presence at the park faded. By the start of this century, few people recalled that the Glendale area had not only been a stronghold of Nazi activism but also a breeding ground for other hate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s and the John Birch Society in the 1950s. In the 1960s, Glendale was West Coast headquarters of the American Nazi Party. In 1962, when the KKK experienced a revival in response to the burgeoning civil rights movement, the Klan paraded down Glendale's main thoroughfare, Brand Boulevard, with a horse brigade, marching band and burning cross. As recently as 2012, a tiny hate group called the Crescenta Valley European American Society, promoting ""white identity and white pride,"" had a brief presence on the internet and sponsored a European American Heritage Festival at Hindenburg Park -- which generated controversy at the time -- but all manifestations of this group, including its website, soon disappeared. The La Crescenta and Glendale areas are now more diverse than in earlier years, but the scars of racism, anti-Semitism, white supremacy, and other forms of bigotry never completely heal, as reflected in the upsurge of protest after the appearance of the new ""Welcome to Hindenburg Park"" sign last month. Hans Eberhard, the Tri-Centennial Foundation's chairman, seemed either naïve or willfully ignorant about the significance of the site's Nazi past.He told the Glendale News-Press that people who hoisted flags bearing swastikas in the park did so because it was the German flag at the time, not because they were Nazis.Seeking to downplay the dispute, Eberhard explained, ""This is a welcome to Hindenburg Park. There's nothing wrong with that. It's an indication this is a historic site."" Kaye Michelson from the L.A. County Department of Parks and Recreation echoed similar sentiments. ""The intent was, and is, to honor the German-American heritage of the park,"" she said in an interview with the Jewish Journal. Steve Pierce, a Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce board member, agreed. ""The sign is just recognizing the German culture that was in our community,"" he told the Glendale News Press last month. ""I think that's important. I'm very in support of that.""Mike Lawler, former president of the Historical Society of the Crescenta Valley, who has documented the area's history of racial, ethnic, and religious bigotry, has a somewhat more nuanced view. The park's history, he told me, is part of the ""simple and recurring American story of an immigrant group celebrating their heritage as they assimilate."" But Lawler also understood why the sign has triggered a protest movement. ""My overall feeling is that by burying uncomfortable events in history, we risk repeating past mistakes. Obviously, I don't have the perspective of having been the victim of a mass genocide, so I cannot relate to the Jewish Federation's feelings of offense. But I would hope that bringing attention to the park's history would provide an opportunity for educating future generations about the dangers of nationalism and hate groups like the Bund.""Bernstein, the leading historian of the German-American Bund, was quick to tell me that ""most German Americans weren't Nazis or Nazi sympathizers."" Many, he said were ""ashamed of Hitler and what was going on in Germany, and strongly denounced Kuhn and his followers."" ""The Bund was a small group compared with the number of German Americans living in the United States,"" he explained. ""But they were loud and noisy."" Bernstein believes that any sign or plaque erected at La Crescenta County Park should not simply celebrate local German culture but also mention that the park was the site of pro-Nazi rallies. ""This controversy isn't about Hindenburg himself, but what the park represents,"" Bernstein said. ""What was going on there was pro-Hitler activity. It's an ugly fact of history but to avoid any mention of that is to erase an important part of the park's past, which is something that people who use the park, or whose tax dollars pay for it, should know about.""

That's because it was the site of Nazi rallies and a Nazi youth camp during the 1930s.In fact, the park's real name is Crescenta Valley County Park and it is owned and operated by Los Angeles County. The new sign was erected last month, on the western edge of the park, by the Tricentennial Foundation, a German heritage organization based in the North Hills section of Los Angeles. The foundation did not erect the sign to remind local residents of the park's horrifying history, but instead, to ""preserve the historical integrity of the site,"" Hans Eberhard, the foundation's chairman, told the Glendale News-Press.I'm a German American and, like many others residents of Los Angeles County, whose tax dollars pay for the park, I find the new sign offensive, not simply because it honors Paul von Hindenburg (a World War One hero and Germany's president from 1925 to 1934 who appointed Adolf Hitler as German chancellor in 1933) but because it obscures the site's ugly past. My family, on my father's side, left Germany and arrived in the United States in the 1860s. But they identified more as Jews than as Germans because of the anti-Semitism they were escaping in their native country. My mother's side of the family left Poland and Lithuania in the 1880s to flee the wave of vicious and violent anti-Jewish pogroms, but they left friends and relatives behind who were later among the six millions Jews murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. My father served in the army in World War Two and lost many friends in battles to rid the world of Hitler and the scourge of German fascism. Many local residents, led by the Jewish Federation of the Greater San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys, are demanding that the County remove the sign. The park is located in the district of Supervisor Michael Antonovich, one of five members of the Board of Supervisors that governs sprawling LA County, the nation's largest county with over 10 million residents. It was under Antonovich's watch last year that the County Department of Parks and Recreation allowed the Tricentennial Foundation to erect the 6-foot high sign at the park's entrance near the corner of Honolulu and Dunsmore avenues. Visitors are greeted with the sign that reads ""Willkommen zum,"" followed by ""Welcome to Hindenburg Park,"" and below that ""The Historic German Section of Crescenta Valley Park."" At the bottom of the sign are the county's official seal and the words ""Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation.""Despite the official seal, the county did not pay for the sign, which cost $2,500, according to Kaye Michelson, the department's acting public information officer. She explained that the Tricentennial Foundation worked with the Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Historical Society of Crescenta Valley and the Crescenta Valley Town Council to fund the sign.Had these organizations -- or Supervisor Antonovich's office -- done their research, they might have predicted that the sign would generate controversy, given the park's history as a gathering place for American Nazis and Nazi sympathizers.Some proponents of the sign argue that they heard no objections about it before the County approved it. ""That's because hardly anyone knew about it until it was put up,"" explained Jason Moss, executive director of the Jewish Federation. ""If it had been a public process, I'm sure people would have opposed it. Now that it's up there, we're voicing our concerns.""An article about the new sign in the Crescenta Valley Weekly last month made no mention of the Nazi rallies held at the park. German-American Bund leader Fritz Kuhn speaking at pro-Nazi rally in Hindenburg Park, April 1939But after several local residents brought the issue to Moss' attention, what appeared to be a harmless historical marker became the subject of controversy. Moss and others brought their complaints to Antonovich, who tried to deflect criticism by referring them to the County Department of Parks and Recreation. ""I think there's a way we can honor German-American culture, but also not forget what took place at that park,"" Moss told me.In response to the complaints, the county's Human Relations Commission will hold a public hearing on Thursday, April 7, from 4-6 pm, at the Sparr Heights Senior Center, 1613 Glencoe Way, Glendale, CA 91208. The hearing officers will report back to the full commission, who will then make a recommendation to County Parks Department, which could then decide what to do. But ultimately it will depend on whether Antonovich -- who has served in that post since 1980 and has a reputation for closely monitoring activities in his district -- insists that the sign be removed. The sign's opponents are urging people to contact Sussy Nemer, a staffperson for Antonovich (Snemer@lacbos.org) to voice their views about the sign.The controversy over the sign offers a teachable moment about local history and about the dangers of ignoring bigotry in our midst. As the cliché goes, if we don't learn from the past, we're doomed to repeat it.In 1925 the German American League acquired the land, named it Hindenburg Park, and maintained it as a private gathering for local German Americans, who held dances, picnics and other events there. Had the park simply been a place where German Americans celebrated their rich and fascinating cultural heritage, it would hardly be contentious. But the site also has a much more troubling history.Although the German American League may have been founded to celebrate German culture, it always had a political side. According to a 1937 article in Life magazine, the group was ""the Nazi organization in the U.S.,"" previously known as the Friends of the New Germany.This country's major pro-Nazi group was the German-American Bund, which sought to promote a favorable view of Nazi Germany and urged Americans to boycott Jewish-owned business. Its rallies not only featured Nazi flags but also American flags, claiming that its members were patriotic Americans. In fact, the Bund claimed that George Washington was ""the first Fascist."" As early as 1936, the Bund operated 19 Nazi-inspired youth camps across the United States. One of them was called Camp Sutter and it was located at the German-American League's Hindenburg Park. I spoke with Arnie Bernstein, author of the 2013 book Swastika Nation: Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund. He explained that the purpose of these Bund youth camps was to ""indoctrinate children in Nazi ideology."" Like most summer camps, the children participated in sports, hikes, arts and crafts and other activities. But they also were taught about Aryan supremacy and told to be loyal to the Bund, its leader Fritz Kuhn, and Adolph Hitler. They wore uniforms similar to those worn by the Hitler Youth group in Germany. They were forced to march around in the middle of the night carrying Bund and American flags, sing the Nazi anthem, give the Nazi salute, and shout ""Sieg Heil"" said Bernstein. As part of their camp activities, they were inculcated with Nazi propaganda. A Congressional investigation also uncovered sexual abuse between the adults and campers, Bernstein said   German-American Bund choir in Hindenburg Park; Bund members marching in the parkIn February 1939, Kuhn, who was often called the ""American Fuehrer,"" spoke at a pro-Nazi Bund rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City that attracted over 20,000 people. There he repeatedly referred to President Franklin D. Roosevelt as ""Frank D. Rosenfeld,"" called his New Deal the ""Jew Deal,"" and stated that ""the Jews are enemies of the United States."" Another rally was held that month at the Bund's West Coast headquarters at 634 West 15th Street in Los Angeles in building known as the Deutsch Haus (German House). The building was a site for pro-Nazi meetings and also housed a restaurant and beer hall as well as the Aryan Bookstore, where one could purchase the Bund newspaper, Hitler's manifesto Mein Kamp, and other Nazi literature. The Deutsch Haus also screened German anti-Semitic propaganda films with titles like ""Kosher Slaughter."" A few months later, on April 30, 1939, the Bund held a rally in Hindenburg Park, promoted as a celebration of Hitler's birthday ten days later. Over 2,000 German-American Bund members came to hear Kuhn and West Coast Bund leader Herman Max Schwinn. According to the Los Angeles Times: ""Clad in a gray-and-black storm trooper uniform and flanked by a dozen uniformed guards, Kuhn spoke from a stage draped in red swastika banners."" The crowd cheered Kuhn and booed as a low-flying plane, sponsored by the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, bombarded the park with thousands of anti-Hitler leaflets.When it was Schwimm's turn to speak, he read a telegram he had sent to President Franklin D. Roosevelt: ""Do everything in your power to quarantine the United States against alien influences which are at work to drag the nation into war."" By ""alien influences"" he meant Jews, whom the Bund correctly believed were trying to get the Roosevelt administration and Congress to oppose Hitler's efforts to take over Europe.A two-minute clip from the documentary film ""Rancho La Canada"" includes footage of activities at Hindenburg Park, including that 1939 Nazi rally. Some of the rally's organizers were later put on trial for sedition.In an interview with the Los Angeles Times that week, Kuhn spouted typical Nazi ideas. Jews, he claimed 62% of the high posts in the federal government and ""have plotted to get hold of almost everything, especially in New York and Hollywood."" That event was only one of many Bund and pro-Nazi events that took place at the park. These gatherings featured speakers from other American fascist organizations - including the Silver Shirts, White Shirts, and Khaki Shirts -- as well as the Bund. Cal State-Northridge hosts a website and archive called ""In Our Own Backyard: Resisting Nazi Propaganda in Southern California, 1933-1945"" that includes photos of Nazi rallies at Hindenburg Park.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Riyadh last week for an official visit full of diplomatic significance. King Salman bin Abdul Aziz conferred the Kingdom's highest civilian award, The King Abdul Aziz Order, on the Indian Prime Minister. For Pakistanis who see the world in binary terms as an eternal conflict between India and Pakistan, this was clearly a win for India. Despite giving billions of dollars in aid and employing millions of Pakistanis, the Saudis have never bestowed their highest civilian honor on a Pakistani leader.For their part, India and Saudi Arabia base their relations on mutual interests, not on the basis of taking sides in a rivalry most outside the Indian subcontinent no longer care about. Ties between India and the oil rich Gulf countries have been expanding due to economic interests as well as growing military and counter-terrorism cooperation. Pakistan's civilian and military leaders have, however, been oblivious to these changes. Islamabad -the seat of civilian authority -- and Rawalpindi -the headquarters of Pakistan's all-powerful army - still prefer to see the world from the same lens that they have been using for the last six decades. Opposition to India and demands for settlement of the Kashmir dispute remain paramount in Pakistan's foreign policy, as does the view that India's gain is Pakistan's loss.This attitude has blinkered Pakistan's vision, inflated its sense of self-importance and prevented the country's leaders from understanding the subtle changes that have occurred in how most countries view both Pakistan and India. Pakistan's orientation towards the Muslim world was supposed to provide allies in its struggle against an existential threat from 'Hindu' India. There was a view that the bonds of Islam would prevent close relations between Muslim countries and 'Hindu' India while benefiting Pakistan. Pakistan's leaders hoped Muslim countries would help Islamic Pakistan attain parity with 'Hindu' India by providing strength in numbers. Even before partition in 1947 and the creation of Pakistan, the leaders of the All India Muslim League viewed the Muslim Ummah both as a source of numerical as well as ideological support for the about to be created state. At a conference in Cairo in 1946, Pakistan's founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah stated that Pakistan would be the bulwark against the spread of 'Hindu imperialism' and would expect support from the rest of the world's Muslims. However, Jinnah's views were not widely accepted by leaders in Muslim countries. Most secular Arab governments, including those in Egypt, Iraq and Syria preferred anti-imperialist India to western-aligned Pakistan. Even then, among Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia held a special place in Pakistan's worldview. Both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan emphasized Islam in global affairs and both were allied to the United States.Saudi Arabia tried to balance relations with India because of shared membership of the non-aligned movement. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Saudi Arabia in September 1956, he received a warm welcome and was greeted by crowds chanting the slogan ""marhaba rasool al salam [Welcome, prophet of peace]."" But Saudi Arabia tended to be closer to Pakistan, especially from the 1970s onwards, playing the role of financier for the anti-Soviet Jihad in Afghanistan and even for Pakistan's nuclear program.Riyadh never completely broke with India, maintaining mutually beneficial economic and political ties. The number of Indians working in a diverse array of fields in Saudi Arabia - both white and blue collar workers - rose from 34,500 in 1975 to 1.2 million in 1999 and 2.96 million in 2016. This comprised almost half of the 7.3 million Indians in the Gulf who together send USD $ 36 billion in 2015, 52 percent of the total remittances to India annually.India's economic growth, and its increasing demand for energy, made it a major buyer of Saudi Arabia's principal export--Crude oil and petroleum products. Economic factors resulted in the first ever visit by a Saudi monarch to India in five decades in 2006, when Saudi King Abdullah stated that the two countries had deep historical ties and he looked upon India as his ""second home."" Now, India and Saudi Arabia have become economically more significant for one another with US $39.4 billion in bilateral trade in 2014-15. Pakistan-Saudi trade by contrast stood at a meager US $6.1 billion. For India, Saudi Arabia is the main source of its oil imports, supplying one-fifth of India's annual demand. For the Saudis, India is their fifth biggest customer after China, Japan, United States, and South Korea. While economic ties favored India, Pakistan benefited from close defense relations with Saudi Arabia. Pakistan provided thousands of military advisers to the Kingdom during the 1980s. Thousands of Pakistani troops were, at one time, stationed in Saudi Arabia in return for economic assistance. Lately, however, that side of relations has also become frayed. Pakistan turned down Saudi requests for involvement on its side in the war in Yemen and refused to sever ties with the Assad regime in Syria. Criticism in Pakistan over Saudi Arabia's financing of orthodox religious madrasas and charities, which are now blamed for fueling terrorism, also irked the Saudis. The Saudis now seem to have decided to pay less attention to Pakistan's sensitivities in relation to India.India's defense ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have grown only in the recent decade jumpstarted by the 2010 Riyadh declaration issued on occasion of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Saudi Arabia. India and Saudi Arabia signed a defense cooperation pact in 2014 under which the two countries will share defense-related information, undertake military training and education and also cooperate in the field of security. Counter terrorism cooperation has also increased. During the 1990s, Pakistani Jihadi groups raised money in Saudi Arabia with impunity and boasted of connections with the Muslim holy land. Now, the Saudis have put Pakistani groups on lists of terrorist groups deemed a threat to the Kingdom. In 2012 Saudi Arabia arrested and handed over Syed Zabiuddin Ansari, an Indian citizen who joined the Pakistan-based Lashkar e Taiba and was the voice guiding the Lashkar terrorists when they attacked India's financial capital Mumbai in 2008 and killed 166 people and injured over 600. In earlier years Saudi Arabia would have simply returned Ansari to Pakistan but this time it chose to send him back to India. Prime Minister Modi's Riyadh visit, and the warm reception he received, is the latest reminder to Pakistan's leaders that international relations are based on national interest, not vague religion-based ideology. Economic and strategic issues are bringing India and Saudi Arabia closer, just as they are working to the advantage of India with other countries. Pakistan could stick to its guns and see these developments as a threat. Or it could change its own approach to India and seek rapprochement to take advantage of economic and strategic opportunities that are making India a desirable partner for Pakistan's erstwhile friends."

These awards have been sponsored by the Library of Michigan since 2004, but go back almost 25 years. Each year judges pick 20 Notable Michigan books ""reflective of Michigan's diverse ethnic, historical, literary, and cultural experience.""But there've been limits to that diversity.There haven't been any books with major LGBT content among the books annually celebrated and publicized statewide. The fact was confirmed to me by one of the judges, who couldn't explain why. City Pulse, a Michigan magazine, picked up the story. In that piece, the Librarian of Michigan, Randy Riley, muddied the waters by mentioning outing, which I hadn't raised in any way at all, but he admitted that there was a ""blind spot"" in the judging. Without the original blog and the subsequent news coverage, who knows if he would have said anything, but at least the problem is out in the open now:Riley said that the blog post will likely spur discussion among the committee about how to better include LGBT literature. Committee member and City Pulse book reviewer Bill Castanier suggested that the committee, which is flexible in size, consider bringing on a committee member with expertise in the area of LGBT books. Riley is confident that the committee will take steps to create a more inclusive Notable Books program. ""There's not a more open-minded group of people that I've worked with,"" said Riley. ""I'm sure it will be a topic we discuss.""Let's hope they do more than ""discuss"" the 25-year-long absence of LGBT titles and actually bring the awards into the 21st century.

An economist at Princeton who defected from the Reagan dogma, he has written quite eloquently on the GOP's descent into climate change denialism, and political obstructionism and its embrace of discredited economic models. Like too many other mainstream ""liberal pundits,"" however, Krugman has failed to provide similar critical analysis of Democratic Party politicians. He has mockingly dismissed Bernie Sanders and his supporters on many occasions, backing Hilary Clinton in the 2016 race.  Krugman's April 1st column entitled ""Learning from Obama,"" provides a defense of Obama's policies that shows Krugman to be out of touch with the struggles of working people driving support for the Sanders campaign and Donald Trump on the right. Krugman lauds Obama for helping to pass the Dodd-Frank Bill, Obamacare and stricter auto-emission standards and signing of the Paris climate agreement. Obama's stewardship, says Krugman, helped reduce unemployment to below five percent and resulted in the gain of ten million private sector jobs and overall economic stabilization. The lesson of the Obama years, Krugman concludes, is that success doesn't have to be complete to be ""very real. You say you want a revolution, well you can't always get what you want -- but if you try sometimes, you just might get what you need.""This worldview is comforting to societal elites who don't have to bear the direct cost of social injustices. They can feel good about themselves by moving slowly to eradicate, or purportedly eradicate, selective problems while preserving the system in which they enjoy great privileges. In his recently published book Listen Liberal, journalist Thomas Frank provides a critical analysis of the Obama presidency that strongly counter's Krugman's defense. Fitting with the mentality of the Democratic Leadership Council which became ascendant after the defeat of progressive-populist George S. McGovern in the 1972 election, Frank argues that Obama and his inner-circle believed they were fit to rule based on their academic pedigree and professional success and looked down on working class people who did not go to top colleges like them. In their view, economic growth was best achieved through the promotion of technical innovation in business and ""educational reform"" especially charter schools and by extending student loans, not through traditional populist prescriptions which the Democrats had long abandoned. After winning the historic 2008 election, Obama demobilized his progressive base and appointed many of the same elitist economists to manage the U.S. recovery who had pushed deregulatory policies like repealing Glass Steagall (separating investment and regular banking functions) that had caused the 2008 financial crash. Since the recession ended in June 2009, the country's Gross Domestic Product grew under their oversight by 13.8 percent, though salaries in that time have gone up a mere 1.8 percent, while the clout of labor unions continues to shrink. The African American community has been particularly hard hit despite supporting Obama overwhelmingly as have young people facing heavy student debt and bleak job prospects, resulting in a rising drug ""epidemic"". In the pursuit of a grand bargain with the GOP, Obama as Frank points out sent an important signal by failing to prosecute any of the white collar criminals who crashed the economy. Like with Guantanamo Bay, he also broke his pledge to repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which cost an estimated 700,000 American jobs since it was passed by Bill Clinton in 1994, and has pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which promises to off-shore many more manufacturing jobs, while primarily benefiting big pharmaceutical and other multi-national corporations. With regards to the environment, Bill McKibbon in an article in The Nation Magazine entitled ""Global Warming's Terrifying New Chemistry,"" details how a decline in carbon emissions resulting from the closing of coal mines and new fuel efficient cars has been offset by huge methane leakages. These have been caused by the burning of natural gas and fracking (involving exploding subsurface geology so that gas can leak through newly opened pores), which Obama has invested heavily in and endorsed as a centerpiece of his energy policy.Obama has meanwhile presided over record prosecutions of whistle-blowers and an unprecedented surveillance apparatus that has extended to American allies. He expanded the international war on drugs and drone assassination programs and the Af-Pak war to seemingly no end. At the behest of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, Obama at the same time participated in another war that destabilized Libya, and provided a record $60 billion arms deals to Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most oppressive dictatorships and a leading sponsor of Sunni terrorism in the Middle East. Krugman does not say whether being the ""drone king,"" arming dictatorships and destabilizing Middle-East countries is part of Obama's great success. Perhaps he thinks that is the case. His worldview, which echoes the Democratic Party establishment line, only blames the GOP for blocking pro-active change, though with regards to Libya it was many GOP lawmakers who opposed the illegal war on constitutional grounds.Barack Obama Jr. has to be sure faced difficult circumstances in his presidency, racist attacks directed against him, and Republican obstructionism unprecedented in the annals of the modern presidency. He has done numerous good things, like opening Cuba and signing the Iran nuclear deal for foreign policy, and at least acknowledges science and the need for regulation of the financial system.However, any honest assessment of his presidency should acknowledge the considerable missed opportunities, back-tracking on campaign pledges, close ties to Wall Street and the so-called military industrial complex, and the abandonment of America's working class, which Krugman does not. That he is the main voice of ""liberal"" opinion in America's newspaper of record is thus highly problematic. The Times has generally failed its readers by failing to include a genuine liberal-populist on its editorial pages who recognizes that the corporatist bent of the Democratic Party over the last generation has contributed to marked social ills alongside the Republicans.

24,GREEN,Washington White Nose Bat Death Becomes First West Of Rockies,Peter Andrew Hart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/washington-white-nose-syndrome-bat_us_57004994e4b0a06d5805e09a,"This is the first time the disease, which killed 6 million bats in the eastern U.S., has been detected on the West Coast.",2016-04-02,This Washington state bat became the first case of white-nose syndrome west of the Rockies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57004a232e00002d00950449.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A disease that has decimated bat populations in the eastern U.S. has made a shocking jump to the West, putting the winged mammals in peril and threatening to drastically alter ecosystems in the region. A little brown bat with white nose syndrome was found by hikers on a trail east of Seattle in mid-March, the first time the deadly fungus has been detected west of the Rockies. The immobilized bat was taken to an animal shelter, where it died two days later.The discovery was announced Thursday by the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Geological Survey. David Blehert, branch chief of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center’s Wildlife Disease Diagnostic Laboratories, called it “surprising and unusual.”""We’ve been dreading this,” Mollie Matteson, senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Huffington Post. Until March, the westernmost reach of the disease had been Nebraska, 1,300 miles from the site in North Bend, Washington. “This is a drastic jump,” Matteson said.""This is the first time, to our knowledge, that there has been a long-range jump of the fungus,"" Blehert said.The disease, caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructan, can completely wipe out an entire bat colony. It has killed more than 6 million bats in the eastern U.S. The destruction it has wrought on bat populations has been described as the most precipitous decline of North American wildlife in the past century.The fungus grows on the noses, wings and ears of affected bats, giving them a white, fuzzy appearance. The devastating disease spreads throughout bodily tissue, disrupting physiological processes, interrupting essential hibernation periods and causing bats to waste away.Seven cave hibernating species of bats in 28 states and five Canadian provinces have been affected by white nose syndrome since it was first detected in 2006 in upstate New York. Two of those species live in Washington state.""I wish I could be optimistic, but given what we have seen on the East Coast, it’s hard to,"" said Sharlene E. Santana, assistant professor of biology at the University of Washington.""We knew it was coming [to the West], but we didn’t know it would be so soon,"" Matteson said.Analysis of the Washington bat conducted by Blehert and his team revealed concerning details. Tissue analysis found that the disease was at an advanced stage, suggesting it had been present for some time. Second, the genetics of the bat indicate that it was a native of the area, not one that was transported there from afar.""We don’t know how the fungus got there,"" Blehert said. But he offered two hypotheses of how it might have traveled: bat-to-bat, which, at a jump of 1,300 miles, would be an extraordinary one, or through human travel and trade, the largest driver of infectious disease.Humans, who act as carriers of the fungus to vulnerable bat populations, are believed to play a significant role in transmitting the disease. The clothing and gear of hikers and spelunkers can transport the fungus, according to scientists. The disease appears to only affect bats and poses no known threat to humans. But since bats are an integral part of an ecosystem, scientists are concerned about the chain reaction their loss might have on plant and animal life, including humans. Bats play a key role in keeping insect populations in check. Rising insect populations could prompt farmers to use more chemicals to protect their crops, Matteson said. There is potential for a spike in disease-carrying insects if their predators are removed from the picture. And a loss of bats would be disruptive to animals that feed on them and other animals that live in caves.Unfortunately, there is no surefire way to cure the disease or curb its spread.""We had hope that by the time [white nose syndrome] started to spread to the West, that there were more effective treatments in place,"" Matteson said.Genetic analysis offers some hope of learning where the fungus originated, which could help guide precautions in the U.S. and around the world, Blehert said. Researchers are also exploring the possibility of controlling the disease through biological means, such as vaccines.Matteson stressed the need to address the possibility of human spreading of the disease, which is likely how it first arrived in North America from Europe and Asia, where it is endemic.""For years, we have been saying there needs to be stricter protocol put in place to minimize the chance of a jump like this via human transmission,"" she said. In some areas of the country, abandoned caves and mines have been closed to protect resident bats. Federal agencies encourage visitors to decontaminate themselves and gear before entering an area with bats, but Matteson argued decontamination should be mandatory. ""We have species that are at risk of going extinct; it’s the least that could be done,"" she said.Still, scientists are unclear whether it will spread explosively as it has in the eastern U.S. Because bats in the western U.S. tend not to hibernate in large groups, the disease might not spread as widely or quickly from bat to bat, Matteson said. But far less is known in general about how bats hibernate on the West Coast, she said, which means the bats could already be dying.""As the case in Washington indicates, the disease has already been there for a couple years, and it just got discovered this past month,"" she said. The unknowns -- how many bats are infected, how long, and how did the disease get there -- are ""very troubling,"" she continued. It’s also unknown how susceptible West Coast bat species are to the disease. In the worst-case scenario, there may be species on the West Coast that will become ""candidates for the Endangered Species Act listing,"" she said.""One of the huge problems with white nose syndrome has been that the [government] response was slow to get off the ground, it was disorganized, a lack of leadership, there wasn’t any decontamination requirement for western public lands, no cave closures,"" Matteson said.""There will be more in the future,"" she said. ""We need to learn our lesson.""No caves have been closed in Washington yet, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife told the Seattle Times. However, researchers and officials with the Department of Fish and Wildlife are stepping up their monitoring efforts in the state, Santana said.Wildlife officials encourage people who encounter sick or dead bats to report it via an online reporting tool or telephone hotline, 1-800-606-8768."

The sensational trial of Simpson, a former football star, was carried live on major television networks in the United States and transfixed much of the country.Authorities have not described the knife, but the celebrity website TMZ reported it was a kind of folding knife typically used in hunting and fishing.A medical examiner testified for the prosecution during the trial that Brown Simpson and Goldman were likely slain with a single-bladed, 6-inch knife.Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Brown Simpson and Goldman by a civil court jury in 1997 and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims' families, a judgment that has remained largely unfulfilled.He was convicted in Las Vegas in 2008 of kidnapping and robbery in a bungled attempt to recover memorabilia from his storied football career. He is serving a prison term of up to 33 years.Reports about the knife surfaced just as a popular new FX cable television drama series, ""The People v. O.J.

29,THE WORLDPOST,Greece Demands IMF Explain 'Disaster' Remarks In Explosive Leak,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/imf-greece-leak_us_57001521e4b0a06d5805ddf6,"A letter from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras questions whether the country ""can trust"" the lender.",2016-04-02,Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras expressed anger on Saturday about the leaked remarks of IMF officials.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5700178d1500002a000b3e10.jpeg?cache=v10nqRjcHR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The leaked remarks of International Monetary Fund officials suggesting the lender may threaten to pull out of Greece's bailout are eliciting anger in Athens and could jeopardize debt negotiations. The Huffington Post exclusively obtained a private letter on Saturday from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, demanding answers for some of the controversial comments in a March 19 teleconference between Poul Thomsen, IMF European director, Delia Velculescu, IMF chief of mission in Greece and IMF official Iva Petrova.Wikileaks released a transcript of the phone conversation earlier on Saturday in which Thomsen and Velculescu indicate that only a new crisis would prompt both Greece and Germany to fulfill their obligations under the bailout agreement. Velculescu raises concerns that while more time may be needed to push the parties toward an agreement, postponing a meeting could be a ""disaster.""Tsipras wants to know whether Thomsen and Velculescu’s apparent belief that the IMF must rely on another crisis-inducing “credit event” to force Greece’s hand “reflects the official IMF view.” If so, Tsipras challenges the IMF to defend the policy, given accepted norms of negotiation.“Using a credit event as a means to pressurize Greece and the other member states is clearly beyond the bounds of the negotiation process as we understand it,” he wrote.The prime minister also questions whether Greece ""can trust"" the IMF to negotiate in “good faith” given what he sees as Thomsen and Velculescu’s suggestions that they would like to delay negotiation in order to precipitate such a “credit event.”“I sincerely hope that the IMF position is to reach a quick, successful and sustainable conclusion of the review and I am sure you will take all the necessary measures to make sure the negotiation process will remain on track,” Tsipras wrote.Greece has accused Thomsen of effectively sabotaging talks in the past when the IMF refused to compromise on Greek pension cuts after the government proposed alternatives with an equivalent fiscal impact.But while the Greek government views Thomsen and Velculescu’s conversation as yet another sign of bad faith by the IMF, the transcript reveals that the IMF officials doubt European nations’ readiness to agree to debt reductions. The remarks are consistent with the IMF’s insistence in the past that it is a broker between the European Union and Greece, both of which are irresponsible.“What is going to bring it all to a decision point? In the past there has been only one time when the decision has been made and then that was when they were about to run out of money seriously and to default. Right?” Thomsen said.“Right!” Veculescu affirmed.The previous “decision point” Thomsen refers to is when Greece relented to IMF and EU austerity demands last July when it was faced with economic collapse. The European Central Bank’s shutdown of emergency lending forced the Southeastern European country to impose capital controls limiting citizens’ bank withdrawals. That ultimately led the Greek government to agree to the 86-billion euro bailout deal with terms that were much harsher than anything they had previously accepted. That bailout deal was the third such austerity-for-loans program aimed at addressing the Greek debt crisis since 2010.Thomsen speculates in the leaked conversation that if such a “decision point” occurs again, it would take place in July, when EU officials would be focused on keeping the United Kingdom in the union. British voters will decide in a June 23 referendum whether to leave the EU, in what has been dubbed the Brexit. “Clearly the Europeans are not going to have any discussions for a month before the Brexits,” Thomsen posited.The Greek government interpreted this component of Thomsen and Velculescu’s talks as an indication that the IMF plans to precipitate crisis-like conditions before the Brexit referendum to avoid drawing out the process.“The Greek Government asks the IMF for explanations whether pursuing the creation of bankruptcy conditions in Greece, just before the British referendum, is the Fund's official position,” Olga Gerovasili, a spokeswoman for prime minister Tsipras, said in a statement.But Thomsen and Velculescu make clear elsewhere in their discussion that they are equally wary of European nations’ unwillingness to reduce the Greek debt burden, particularly Germany, Greece’s largest sovereign creditor, and the eurozone’s most powerful nation. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaüble expressed his opposition to providing Greece with debt restructuring earlier in March. Thomsen suggested that if the IMF threatens to withdraw from the Greek bailout program, it could exert enough pressure on German prime minister Angela Merkel to agree to the necessary debt relief, especially in light of the political challenge she is facing as a result of the refugee crisis. The IMF’s participation and role as a monitor helped make Germany’s emergency loans to Greece more palatable to the German public. Thomsen described the ultimatum he would give Merkel.“Look, you Mrs. Merkel, you face a question, you have to think about what is more costly: to go ahead without the IMF, would the Bundestag say, ‘The IMF is not on board’? or to pick the debt relief that we think that Greece needs in order to keep us on board? Right? That is really the issue,” Thomsen said.A senior Greek official told the Financial Times the leak was evidence the IMF was ""blackmailing"" Germany on the debt relief issue. ""We will not allow anyone to play with fire and blackmail Greece or Germany or Europe,"" the official said.As part of last July’s bailout agreement, European leaders agreed to discuss reductions in the debts Greece owes individual European nations, which the IMF and the majority of economists believe Greece will never be able to repay in full -- and risk preventing the Greek economy from recovering over the long term.In addition, Velculescu and Thomsen were not in total agreement that Greece had completely failed to enact the spending cuts and tax increases asked of it by creditors.“They are not getting close” to meeting the IMF’s full demands, Velculescu said. “What is interesting though is that... they did give a little bit on both the income tax reform ... the tax credit and the supplementary pensions. They are doing something but it is very small.”“Well, if they come around to give us the 2.5 percent and not on Mickey Mouse stuff, we should be fully behind them,” Thomsen replied, referring to a compromise budget surplus target of 2.5 percent of GDP.The IMF released a statement in response to the leaked transcript that neither confirmed, nor denied the authenticity of the transcript, claiming it does “not comment on leaks or supposed reports of internal discussions.”“We have stated clearly what we think is needed for a durable solution to the economic challenges facing Greece--one that puts Greece on a path of sustainable growth supported by a credible set of reforms matched by debt relief from its European partners,” an IMF spokesperson said. Even if the transcript of the conversation is consistent with the publicly stated views of the IMF it is likely to stoke the kind of suspicion in Greece and Germany that has long created political hurdles to progress in the Greek debt crisis. Greece, and many international observers sympathetic to its predicament, will see the IMF officials’ remarks as more evidence that the Fund and the European Union have little regard for Greece’s sovereignty. The massive spending cuts and tax increases Greece has already implemented in recent years in order to repay its debts have contributed to a massive uptick in poverty and the highest unemployment rate in the European Union.Meanwhile, the IMF's potential threat of withdrawal could exacerbate German suspicion of the bailout process. The German public has long been wary of additional lending to Greece, which it believes has failed to reform its profligate government finances or adequately liberalize its economy.It is also unclear what implications another potential Greek financial standoff will have on the European refugee crisis, of which Greece has been on the front line. Greece is the first entry point for the thousands of refugees flowing into Europe from Turkey and other countries. Tens of thousands of refugees with hopes of reaching more prosperous European nations have been stranded in Greece as neighboring European nations close their borders.The European Union reached a deal with the Turkish government on March 18 to return asylum seekers trying to reach the continent by sea in exchange for additional aid to Turkey. They also agreed to an increase in the number of Turkey-based refugees Europe would resettle through a formal absorption process. The plan goes into effect on Monday."

It was not immediately clear if the death toll included soldiers only.Earlier on Saturday, Nagorno-Karabakh's military said Armenian anti-aircraft forces had downed an Azeri helicopter. Baku admitted that its Mi-24 helicopter was shot down.Both sides also reported civilian casualties and accused each other of violating a 1994 ceasefire, a sign that the two-decade-old conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead is far from a peaceful resolution. Similar violence was reported last month.The violence has forced Russia, a key mediator in the conflict, to step up diplomatic efforts to quench it.President Vladimir Putin urged the warring sides to immediately observe the ceasefire and ""to exercise restraint so as to avert new human casualties,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu have talked by phone with their Armenian and Azeri counterparts.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, meanwhile, called on both sides ""to immediately stop fighting and to fully respect the ceasefire.""Azerbaijan frequently threatens to take Nagorno-Karabakh back by force. Clashes around the region have fueled worries of a widening conflict breaking out in the region, which is crossed by oil and natural gas pipelines.On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for ""an ultimate resolution"" of the conflict between during talks with Azeri President Ilham Aliyev at the State Department.(Writing and additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow and Madeline Chambers in Berlin; Editing by Larry King)"

Those bombs and a separate one on a metro train in the city killed 35 people, including three bombers.""Never will we forget this black day,"" the airport's chief executive Arnaud Feist told a news conference. ""A restart of the operations even only partially as quick as this is a sign of hope.""""As of tomorrow, Sunday, Brussels Airport should be partially operational,"" he added.Feist said the airport had planned three flights for the first day, to Faro, Athens and Turin, all operated by Brussels Airlines. The number of flights should increase over time.The airport is one of the largest in Europe, handling 23.5 million passengers and 489,000 tonnes of freight annually. It links the Belgian capital, headquarter city of the European Union and NATO, with 226 destinations worldwide through 77 different airlines.With its temporary check-in zone, it will only be able to handle some 800 departing passengers per hour, around 20 percent of previous capacity.The airport says it aims to return to maximum capacity before the start of summer holidays at the end of June or early July, with some check-in desks restored in the departure hall, followed by a full reopening of that space.Initially, the airport will only be accessible by car.Special cameras will be set up to read number plates, there will be random checks of vehicles and the drop-off zone will not be accessible.Passengers and their baggage will be checked on arrival and there will be increased patrols of armed police and military.Brussels Airlines, Belgium's largest carrier and 45 percent owned by Lufthansa, has estimated the closure of its Brussels hub is costing it 5 million euros ($5.7 million) per day.The city's association of hotel operators pointed to the closed airport as one of the main reasons for a more than 50 percent drop in overnight stays up to March 28.(Reporting By Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Jeremy Gaunt)"

35,POLITICS,Big Banks Aided Firm At Center Of International Bribery Scandal,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unaoil-citibank-hsbc_us_56feba02e4b0daf53aefa1da,Unaoil relied on both banks as it cut deals with corrupt regimes.,2016-04-02,How much did the banks know or suspect about Unaoil's shady practices?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56febc0a1500002a000b3d79.jpeg?cache=zwqMZ49CPo&ops=crop_0_314_3000_1280%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"No business can operate without bankers -- not even the bribery business.British financial giant HSBC and American bailout kingpin Citibank processed transactions, managed money and vouched for Unaoil, a once-obscure firm that is now at the center of a massive international corruption scandal. Police raided Unaoil's Monaco offices and interviewed its executives on Thursday, a day after The Huffington Post and Fairfax Media first exposed the company's practices. Law enforcement agencies in at least four nations are involved in a wide-ranging probe of the company and its partners.Halliburton, KBR and other corporate conglomerates relied on Unaoil to deliver them lucrative contracts with corrupt regimes in oil-rich nations. But without the help of banks like HSBC and Citibank, none of Unaoil's operations would have been possible. Both Citibank and HSBC declined to comment on whether Unaoil or the Ahsani family, who own and operate the firm, remain their clients.""As a matter of policy, we only maintain relationships with clients who have been vetted through our strict due diligence and compliance checks,"" HSBC spokeswoman Sorrel Beynon told HuffPost in a written statement.Listen to HuffPost's discussion of the Unaoil scandal in the latest ""So That Happened"" podcast, embedded below. The discussion begins at the 24:30 mark.Subscribe to HuffPost’s politics podcast here.Two federal statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and the Patriot Act of 2001, make it a crime for banks to knowingly process transactions related to illegal activity or to ignore red flags that they may be allowing illegal cash to flow through the financial system. Whether Citibank or HSBC broke the law depends on whether investigators determine that Unaoil's deals were illegal and whether the banks knew or should have known about that.Thousands of internal Unaoil emails obtained by HuffPost and Fairfax Media make clear that both HSBC and Citibank were intimately involved in Unaoil's complex finances.In Kazakhstan, Unaoil helped U.S. energy conglomerate KBR and British oil company Petrofac secure millions of dollars of work on the Kashagan oil field, one of the biggest fossil fuel discoveries of the 21st century. The joint contract was facilitated by huge payments that Unaoil made to a consultant working for Kazakhstan's state-owned oil company. That arrangement could potentially run afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies that do business in the United States from paying bribes to foreign government agents.In a statement to HuffPost and Fairfax Media, Unaoil founder Ata Ahsani denied that his firm bribed public officials. “The answer is absolutely no,” Ahsani said.The KBR money went through HSBC's Private Bank subsidiary in Monaco, according to emails. The Petrofac funds went through Citibank's affiliate in Geneva, Switzerland, until late 2008, when they began flowing through HSBC. HSBC also executed trades in shares of Petrofac stock on behalf of Unaoil. On the Kazakhstan deal alone, HSBC processed millions of dollars in payments to Unaoil from KBR.Unaoil deliberately structured bank accounts to obscure its dealings from other companies and legal authorities. In September 2008, for instance, the firm was negotiating a contract with Weatherford, a U.S. chemical company that was paying Unaoil to help it get business with the Iraqi government. Unaoil finance manager Sandy Young sent an email to the firm's leadership explaining why the firm wanted to shield as many bank accounts as possible from Weatherford, which was required to perform due diligence on Unaoil under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Unaoil eventually secured a lucrative deal with the Iraqi government on behalf of Weatherford that involved paying kickbacks to senior Iraqi officials.""Restricting the audit rights to the bank account where [Weatherford] monies have been transferred into is certainly preferred with advance warning and inspection during normal working hours,"" Young wrote. ""As it stands today we use such several sub-accounts only to collect money from principals (we do not make payments from these sub-accounts other than to transfer funds out to our main account from which all payments are made). So with such restrictions all Wfd. would be able to see will be their payments coming in and subsequent transfers of funds out of this account to our main account.""In other words, money from major Western corporations went into one account, which was then transferred to other accounts, which in turn was used to pay various officials. This made it harder for outsiders to track Unaoil's funds. It is not clear from the emails what the company's bankers knew about the legality of Unaoil's activities. But it is very clear that Unaoil trusted both HSBC and Citibank with the detailed orchestration of its accounts.Valerie Kanat and Robert Troxler were in charge of Citibank's Unaoil business. When Troxler left Citibank in early 2007 to start his own firm, Unaoil decided to keep him as an investment adviser, while continuing to work with Kanat at the bank. Ata Ahsani explained the decision in a March 14, 2007, email to Kanat that suggests Troxler had deep knowledge of the firm's financial complexities.""We value his advice and even more his ability to coordinate all our investment activities across all our banks/funds etc.,"" Ahsani wrote. Troxler and Kanat did not respond to requests for comment. Citibank said Kanat left the company in 2009. HSBC and Citibank have histories of corruption. In 2012, HSBC was fined $1.9 billion for laundering drug money and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. In 2015, it paid Swiss authorities $43 million to settle allegations that it helped the global elite illegally dodge taxes. Citibank was fined $140 million last year for violations of money laundering laws related to its work with an energy company involved in a bribery scandal with the Mexican government. The bank is currently being investigated for its role in the bribery scandal at FIFA, the international soccer organization.In addition to managing Unaoil's accounts, HSBC also vouched for the company, helped it win business and loaned money to members of the Ahsani family. In October 2004, Unaoil asked HSBC to send a letter to the Iraqi government vouching for the company as a legitimate business in sound enough financial shape to follow through on its bid for a government contract. In September 2007, HSBC helped Unaoil arrange for a bid bond from the Trade Bank of Iraq so that it could bid on a separate piece of business. And Cyrus Ahsani, a top official at Unaoil and son of its founder, took out a loan from HSBC in 2007 to help him buy Villa Beaulieu in Monaco, a lavish estate with marble-floored balconies and high-end furniture imported from Italy and Paris.Unaoil was so close with HSBC that in November 2007, Saman Ahsani -- another member of the family -- sent an email to bank officials Keith Campbell and James Dodson asking if HSBC would be interested in financing a project with a host of oil companies in Kazakhstan.""I feel I owed it to our long-standing relationship with HSBC Private Bank to give you first right of refusal – at any rate it doesn’t hurt us to inject some competition into the fee discussions!"" Ahsani wrote. ""But as we discussed, this is one of the more straight forward transactions we are involved in and, I feel, a good starting point for our relationship with the Corporate bank – after which hopefully you will have enough comfort to begin discussing our more exotic activities, such as our work with Rolls Royce in Iraq where we are just about to start trading, installing and commissioning (ie. technical trading) their turbines for the South Oil Company.""""Exotic"" is an apt descriptor of Unaoil's activities with Rolls Royce in Iraq. According to emails, Unaoil paid thousands of dollars a day to stay in the good graces of a senior Iraqi oil official in order to help secure a pricey contract for Rolls Royce to make generators. Rolls Royce is currently cooperating with an investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office.Unaoil also capitalized on its relationships with Citibank and HSBC to win business with new clients. As money laundering standards tightened after the passage of the Patriot Act, many companies began requesting more stringent details about Unaoil's operations. When German manufacturer Man Turbo pressed the firm for credentials in the fall of 2007, Unaoil's response included ""bank recommendations"" from both HSBC and Citibank.Citibank also had a cozy relationship with the Ahsani family. In March 2007, Kanat secured VIP tickets for Ahsani brothers Saman and Cyrus to attend the elite Top Marques car show in Monaco. That summer, she got them in the room with members of the Chinese government.""There will be interactions with senior government officials as well as the who's who in the Chinese business community, providing deep investment insights into China,"" Kanat wrote in an email.Kanat booked the Ahsani clan for a 2007 conference in Dubai and offered to help them obtain discounts on luxury hotels. She got the family access to an exclusive dinner-and-drinks event in the south of France at the Grand Hotel du Cap Ferrat held in August 2008. When Cyrus couldn't attend, his brother Sassan mocked him via email, ""U is gay.""The Ahsanis thanked Kanat for her efforts by sending her a gift in January 2009.""Dear Ata, Samy and Cyrus,"" she wrote. ""I have received this morning at home a lovely gift! It was a very good surprise! I thank you very much for this kind thought."""

Come out now or I'm sending in a police dog! You may be bitten!""After repeating the warning without a reply, he unleashed the dog, which ran into the office, pounced onto the couch and attacked Lowry, tearing open her upper lip.Spotting the woman with his flashlight, the officer called the dog back to his side. But by then, Lowry was bleeding profusely from a wound that would take three stitches to close.The handler, Sergeant Bill Nulton, later told Lowry she was ""very lucky"" because his dog ""could have ripped your face off,"" according to the account.Nulton said in a deposition that police dogs are trained to enter a building when they are unleashed and to bite the first person they find and hold that bite until called off.The dissenting appellate judge wrote that reinstating the suit means any officer in the nine-state Western region encompassed by the 9th Circuit who releases a police dog and follows with a flashlight in search of a suspect could ""wind up in trial.""San Diego police declined comment on the case.(Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Sandra Maler)"

We immediately wanted to show our opposition to the bill, and we wrote an open letter to participating talent and all the fans that follow Moogfest online. Alongside other businesses in North Carolina and throughout the country, we restated our commitment to non-discrimination. We have aligned with Equality NC and the ACLU of North Carolina, and are meeting with activists and community groups in Durham to further educate ourselves, while forming a coalition to combat this law. We have a global community, and we will use our platform to protest House Bill 2 -- on the stage, in the streets and online. Our friends and colleagues in Durham and throughout the state are so creative, diverse and inclusive, and we want to let the world see that this not the North Carolina we know and love.Of course, we organize a large annual event and we are proud to host people from all over the world. We are taking every step possible to ensure that Moogfest remains a safe and welcoming space for all festival-goers, especially the many LGBTQ artists and speakers joining us this year. We will do this by both designating gender neutral bathrooms and dedicating spaces for education and dialogue around the issue of LGBT discrimination. We invite others to help us in this work, at the festival and beyond. We are always open to collaborating in new ways towards a more inclusive future for everyone. Why are queer and trans issues so important to Moogfest?It was Bob Moog’s lifelong belief that true innovation comes through collaboration, not exclusion. In fact, Bob was a longtime collaborator and friend of Wendy Carlos, a trans woman whose 1968 Grammy Award-winning and platinum-selling album “Switched On Bach"" introduced many to the Moog synthesizer for the first time. Their work together, creating new technologies and reframing musical composition -- combining art, engineering and entrepreneurship -- epitomizes what Moogfest has become. We value self-expression and experimentation above all else. We offer an inclusive environment where people from all backgrounds can come together to explore big ideas for a future that is not so easy to categorize.In some ways, we’re queering the typical music festival.What do you want the queer community to know about the festival's relationship with the LGBT community?It’s interesting to note that some of our most exciting programming addresses issues important to LGBTQ community, and we have many queer speakers and performers, including one of our keynote presenters, Dr. Martine Rothblatt, and hip-hop artist Mykki Blanco. Most importantly, we want all our our artists and our fans know that they will find a safe and welcoming environment, and that they can count on an amazing, mind-bending and inspiring experience that is open to all.Moogfest is May 19-22 in Durham, North Carolina.
