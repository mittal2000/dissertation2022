With just two swipes, the uber-girly shade instantly brightens my face. Plus, it makes for an easy alternative to matte red or rich purple lipsticks that aren't exactly ideal for the office, even as a beauty editor. Below, Jessie Powers, MAKE UP FOR EVER managing educator, dishes on why you need pink lipstick in your makeup bag, plus tips on how to pull the color off. And to find the best lipstick for you, scroll down for our tried-and-true product recommendations.Pink: A shade that any woman can feel comfortable wearing Pink is the new red because it is a versatile shade that is fun and flirty without looking too bold or overdone. Everyone from Emma Stone and Kate Bosworth (pictured left) to Nicole Richie and Katy Perry have been rocking pink lips on the red carpet--just as glamorous as red, but with a softer finish.Believe it or not, there is a pink lip color for every complexion Typically cool pinks work best with cool undertones in the pink and beige skin tone range. Likewise, warm pinks usually work best with warmer undertones in the golden, amber or olive range. If you tend to be a bit color shy, try a sheer formula that lets a little of your natural lip color shine through. Use a reverse lip liner around the edge of lips to prevent lipstick from bleeding and altering the shade.Take your pink pout from the office to happy hour One of my favorite day looks is clean makeup that puts the focus on the lips and cheeks. Keep your eyes minimal with a flesh tone or no shadow all together. Apply a generous coat of mascara to upper and lower lashes. Use a pink lipstick with a bit of pop and apply a complementary pink blush to the apples of the cheeks rather than the contour of the cheekbones. The overall effect is youthful and feminine. Itâ€™s also one of the least time-consuming routines.A great night look that plays up the sultry side of pink lipstick is a smoky lash line. Apply a black kohl pencil around the lash line and smudge out with a deep color shadow. I love pairing a shimmering aubergine or black gold with a rich black pencil. For really seductive eyes, line the inner rim of the upper and lower lash line with the pencil. Apply two generous coats of mascara to lashes and fan them out for dramatic impact. Choose a neutral blush or bronzer and apply to the contours of the cheekbones. Finally, give your look a girlish twist with a pink lip. If your style is bold, try an opaque bubblegum pink. If your style is a bit more reserved, choose a pastel pink gloss.Want more? Be sure to check out Stylelist on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Pinterest."
