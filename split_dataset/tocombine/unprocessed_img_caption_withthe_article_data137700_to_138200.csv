Or how about the fact that only 28% of those same women share social media passwords with their significant other? Those are just two of the findings from our newly-published research study on the global wired woman. The research was done in partnership with MSLGROUP in order to quantify and make sense of the ""Dot Complicated"" world these women live in.There are enormous benefits to technology, obviously -- but also a whole new set of challenges, especially for those of us raising children in the digital world, or navigating a complex work environment in which our colleagues now know everything about our personal lives as well. It often seems that for every problem technology solves, it creates new ones in its wake. An overwhelming number of emails, a serious problem with texting and driving, vicious cyber bullying and an inability to give anyone our undivided attention, just to name a few. For example, we found that 38% of women would prefer to give up sex for an entire month than go without their phone. That either says a lot about their devices or their partners, but either way, the theme of mobile devices taking precedence over human interactions grows every year.On November 5, I released two books: Dot Complicated and Dot. Dot Complicated is the story of my own, personal, complicated relationship with technology: I was on the front lines of social media, yet I wasn't an engineer; I led massive projects for the company, while feeling pressure from my famous last name; I'm raising a family of my own, while learning these new tools at the same time as everyone else. I talk openly and candidly about my own struggles with technology and my thoughts on finding balance in an over-connected world.As I was writing Dot Complicated, I realized I was only telling part of the story. Children today are introduced to technology so early -- they often speak ""tech"" as a first language -- which means we need to educate them on the benefits and perils of these devices earlier than ever. So, why was I only speaking to parents?The HarperCollins Children's team embraced my idea of simultaneously releasing a children's picture book and thus, Dot was born. Dot is a spunky, tech-savvy girl who learns to put down her gadgets and go play outside. This book has certainly touched a passionate nerve -- both from people who feel that Dot perfectly captures what's happening in their own families (I even had a woman ask me to sign a copy for her husband!), as well as from people angered by the fact that younger and younger children now use tech on a daily basis.I truly feel we're all pioneers together in this digital domain, trying to shape a wired world that enhances our lives and social interactions without compromising our core values. Parents today may have to do some catching up to stay on pace with our young digital natives, but if anyone can figure out how to navigate this new landscape, it's us. All statistics cited come from ""Women Online: The Social Wisdom of Wired Women Around The World,"" a Fall 2013 research report from MSLGROUP and Dot Complicated."

At least 700 couples are expected to get married on the date 12/12/12, the last such triple-date of this year, as they believe the date will bring them everlasting love.

That's a 796 percent increase from the 371 who were married on the same date last year.Why are so many rushing to the altar? Tuesday marks 11/12/13 -- a date with consecutive numbers. It's also the second-to-last sequential date this century. According to the “What’s on Brides’ Minds” survey by David’s Bridal, 40 percent of brides would consider planning their wedding on a special date -- a trend the company's chief marketing officer, Brian Beitler, said is here to stay. “The wedding is the most significant event happening in a couple’s life at the moment, and potentially one of the most important of their entire life,” Beitler told The Huffington Post. “Anything that helps to make that more significant is important to them. Whether it’s wearing a mother’s wedding dress or jewelry, brides always look for something to help mark this momentous occasion, and sequential numbers can be a very important reason to do that.”There’s also a less romantic reason to get hitched on Tuesday.“The practical side of it is that grooms aren’t always terrific at remembering anniversaries, and so sometimes the bride will do anything possible to help her new husband out,” Beitler said.Jamal Lawler, who plans to tie the knot with fiancée Rashida Tillman in the Dominican Republic on 11/12/13, admitted that was one reason he chose Tuesday for a wedding date. “I never want to be the husband who forgets his anniversary, and there’s no way I can forget 11/12/13,” Lawler told The Huffington Post. Lawler said he “couldn’t miss out” on marrying on the ""monumental"" day for an even more significant reason. ""The date is also meaningful because it’s my father’s birthday, and he is actually the minister who will be marrying us."" For Lauren Foster, a certified public accountant who said she’s drawn to numbers and patterns, marrying on 11/12/13 is another way to make her big day special. “There is something very special about choosing a date that has something unique associated with it,” Foster said. “Getting married to [my fiancé] David is the most meaningful piece of all, and that would be amazing no matter what the date on the calendar, but the fact that we could do it then adds an element of fun and whimsy to the event.” Foster with her fiancé David KovarThe pair plan to marry on a Carnival cruise sailing from New York to Florida and the Bahamas, alongside 15 family members. Beitler predicted that 12/13/14 will be an even bigger day to marry than 11/12/13, and not only because it’s the last sequential date this century. Dec. 13, 2014, falls on a Saturday -– the most popular day of any week to get hitched.“Between having an iconic date and having the days line up with the most important marrying date in the week, we think there’s a potential for this to be huge,” Beitler said.
