At least 117 American funds, with a combined $4.6 trillion in assets, have taken no action to mitigate the risks associated with a warming planet.“It simply isn’t professional for the funds to do nothing,” Julian Poulter, the group's CEO, told The Huffington Post.Indeed, there have been warning signs for quite some time that big investors, from a purely financial perspective, need to think hard about fossil fuels. The S&P 500 stock index is up around 50 percent from 10 years ago. Oil stocks over the same period are up just over 1 percent.And business is arguably only going to get harder. Global financial regulators are starting to work out a standard system for companies to voluntarily disclose climate risks, the governor of the Bank of England has warned insurance companies that they're at risk of being wiped out by climate change, and Saudi Arabia wants to kick its oil habit.A 2013 report from England's Institute and Faculty of Actuaries found that under business-as-usual policies, resource scarcity associated with a changing climate could stall the global economy and cause pension funds to be unable to pay out benefits.So what should a prudent pension fund manager do? “There are many ways to skin the climate-risk cat,” Poulter said. Funds can engage with fossil fuel companies and try to push companies to deal with the climate-related risk they face. Or they can choose to screen out companies that haven’t come to grips with that risk. They can invest in renewable energy firms and other companies that will prosper in a low-emissions world. And since the funds we're talking about are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, they could realistically do a little bit of all of the above.The point of the analysis isn’t to be prescriptive or legalistic in telling pension funds what they should or shouldn’t do. It’s to push them to understand the reality of the climate risk embedded in their investments, and explain to their members -- whose retirements are on the line -- what they are doing (or not), and why.What Poulter wants is for pension fund managers to realize that they can’t ignore climate change. When oil is at $43 dollars a barrel, the Paris agreement is striving to keep global temperatures from rising and “you’ve the likes of Saudi Arabia selling their main asset because they see an oil-free world,” it’s just not acceptable for pension funds to act like nothing is happening."

The home had been burglarized perviously ""in recent weeks,"" sources told the paper.As of Tuesday, no arrests had been made. The NJIT and the Essex County's Sheriff's Crimestoppers Program are both offering up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction, for a combined total reward of $20,000.Micalizzi, who made the dean’s list in the fall, was in his second year at NJIT after transferring from Brookdale Community College, his school said. An on-campus memorial has been scheduled for Tuesday night in his honor.Micalizzi's family, meanwhile, is still trying to make sense of what happened.“He died senselessly, that’s all I can say,” his father, John, told the New York Times from the family's home in Freehold, New Jersey. “He was a good kid, studying very hard for his engineering degree. I haven’t met a single person who didn’t love him.”Tragically, Micalizzi’s death comes about three weeks after 21-year-old Shani Patel, a student at Rutgers-Newark, was fatally shot during a robbery at his off-campus apartment. The murder scene was just three blocks from the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house.Local reports have suggested the April 10 robbery may have been drug-related. Newark man Marcus Feliz has since been charged with Patel’s murder."

All but one pleaded guilty to multiple federal extortion charges. Above, protesters march in support of Maryland's announcement that Baltimore police officers would be charged in the May 2015 death of Freddie Gray.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561466cb1600002e000383c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a Baltimore police officer's plea to overturn his federal conspiracy conviction -- the latest development in one of the worst cases of corruption in the history of the city's police department.The Majestic Auto Repair Shop saga, as the case is known, revealed problems within the force so widespread that the police chief himself led the dramatic initial round of arrests.The scheme seemed lifted straight from ""The Wire"": Majestic's owners conspired with several members of the police department to funnel more customers to the struggling business. Every time the shop got a vehicle referral from the police, the cops would get a cut of the profits.Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the lead opinion in the case, broke down this arrangement in no uncertain terms.""Because police are often among the first to arrive at the scene of an accident, the Baltimore officers were well positioned to route damaged vehicles to Majestic,"" he wrote. ""As a result, the kickback scheme was highly successful: It substantially increased Majestic’s volume of business and profits, and by early 2011 it provided Majestic with at least 90% of its customers.""Nearly everyone ensnared in the ring pleaded guilty to multiple federal extortion charges, except Samuel Ocasio, the lonely holdout. The officer insisted on a trial. A jury convicted him anyway -- of three bribery charges and an extra count of federal conspiracy.Curiously, Ocasio didn't contest his bribery convictions, only the conspiracy one. His argument, in essence, was that he never conspired with anyone, because conspiring to extort money from someone necessarily requires an innocent victim to extort from.Since Ocasio's buddies at Majestic were just as guilty as he was in the whole scheme, he urged the Supreme Court to toss the conspiracy conviction. On a 5-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court said no.""Under longstanding principles of conspiracy law, a defendant may be convicted of conspiring to violate [federal anti-extortion law] based on proof that he entered into a conspiracy that had as its objective the obtaining of property from another conspirator with his consent and under color of official right,"" Alito wrote for the court, premised on ""basic principles of conspiracy law."" Notably, the justices were far from united. Alito led a mostly liberal majority, while Justice Stephen Breyer joined that group but wrote separately to question whether ""extortion"" and ""bribery"" should even be considered equal under the law. Justice Clarence Thomas, for his part, dissented alone, as he tends to do.The big surprise was the rare alliance between Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Chief Justice John Roberts, who rallied against the larger policy issues with federal conspiracy law -- often decried for sweeping too broadly.""Conspiracy has long been criticized as vague and elastic, fitting whatever a prosecutor needs in a given case,"" Sotomayor wrote, as she pointed to the problem of extending ""the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of conspiracy prosecutions.""Maybe the discord among the justices is a harbinger of what's to come in another high-profile corruption case: that of convicted Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, which the court heard last week. Time will tell."

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The events of late June and early July 1969 marked a turning point for gay rights, when gay people in New York City took a stand against police harassment.The Stonewall riots refer to a week of violent clashes on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village between patrons of a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn and police who had periodically raided the bar, arresting gays under morals laws of the era.The crackdown was also tied up in a dispute between the Mafia, which owned the bar, and corrupt police officers seeking payoffs for protection. But it unleashed a year of protests culminating with the first gay pride parade in 1970.U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat whose district includes the Stonewall, is inviting people to a public meeting set for Monday to discuss the proposal with Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis.The proposal would ""designate a new unit of the National Park System dedicated to the history of the Stonewall uprising that inspired the modern Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) civil rights movement in America,"" according to Nadler's website.Nadler introduced legislation last December to establish the Stonewall National Historic Site to commemorate the uprising.Lacking an act of Congress, the monument could be established through an executive order. Obama has issued several orders creating monuments.""The Stonewall uprising became the major catalyst for change in the self-awareness of the LGBT community, as well as in the perception and acceptance of LGBT individuals within the United States, and now represents to the nation and the world the struggle for LGBT civil rights,"" Nadler's bill says.(Reporting by Mohammad Zargham and Roberta Rampton in Washington and Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Eric Walsh and Dan Grebler)"
5,POLITICS,"No, Bernie Sanders Has Not Pushed Hillary Clinton To The Left",Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-to-the-left_us_5727d46fe4b0bc9cb0445659,He's done something much more important.,2016-05-03,Bernie Sanders has achieved something more significant than making Hillary Clinton embrace more progressive policies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5727d618220000360025533d.jpeg?cache=QzYwq84Xmj&ops=crop_229_1074_2865_1471%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Different people run for president for different reasons. Some want to publicize important issues or influence political party platforms. Some want to sell books or score cable news contracts. Some actually want to be president.If Bernie Sanders jumped into the presidential primary game to move Hillary Clinton to the left on economic justice, he failed. Back when Clinton was still worrying about Sanders securing the Democratic nomination, she spent weeks accusing him of running a single-issue campaign on economic inequality. Her charge was essentially true. And on all but one key tenet of Sanders' economic platform, Clinton hasn't budged.Listen to HuffPost's analysis of the Sanders and Clinton campaigns on the latest episode of the ""So, That Happened"" politics podcast, embedded below:Clinton's sole leftward economic conversion was on trade. Early in the campaign, Clinton told a reporter she opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she had helped craft during her tenure at the State Department. This was real movement, but it probably won't matter. President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans had the votes to pass TPP last year. It's just a question of when House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) decides to bring it to the floor (hint: lame-duck session). In the months since this reversal, Clinton has attacked single-payer health care and repeatedly defended her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs by invoking the logic of Citizens United. On Wall Street reform, she has maintained her original position of implementing Dodd-Frank (with a few new disclosures). Her top economist supporters have dismissed the too-big-to-fail banking problem as unimportant. When the Sanders campaign touted research from a liberal academic, Clinton's economic braintrust smeared him without even reading his analysis. Clinton herself continues to defend the 1994 welfare reform bill, which was designed to cut public assistance to the poor, and succeeded in doing so. She downplayed the entire issue of economic inequality on the grounds that solving it will not fix racism (no word on how it would impact the ""super predator"" problem). Her position on the minimum wage is a number salad. Clinton, in short, remains a proponent of bread-and-circuses liberalism, not a critic of corporate power or structural economic inequality. Sanders hasn't pushed her to the left. At best, he has driven her to say weird things in public.Sanders is a true believer in economic justice who possesses the ability to project integrity on the stump. But a 74-year-old white guy from Vermont is not what the populist wing of the Democratic Party wanted to put forward as its standard-bearer in 2016. Sanders is just the guy who was willing to step up when Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) didn't run. His campaign is a perpetual administrative debacle. He didn't have foreign policy advisers until, uh, March, kind of? He dismissed his director of Jewish outreach in mid-April for publicly expressing Sanders' own views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His voting record on guns has several breaks with the Democratic electorate. Every time he calls for Clinton to release transcripts of her Goldman Sachs speeches, she points out that he hasn't released his tax returns. It's May.But despite all of this, Sanders gave Clinton a run for her money in a race where the entire party leadership had lined up to support her. He has pushed a nationwide deficit of more than 50 percentage points into a close race. And he has done it without taking corporate money.That is the core achievement of the Sanders insurgency, and it is much more significant than making Clinton apologize for welfare reform. For decades, centrist Democrats have insisted that they cannot compete with Republicans if they do not court donations from corporate elites. Corporate-friendly Democrats routinely justify terrible votes on awful policy by pointing to fundraising. That excuse is now dead. Sanders killed it.Sanders has demonstrated that it is in fact possible to run for president as a progressive and still wage a credible national campaign without relying on financial support from the super-rich.That bald fact should change the way Democrats conduct policymaking. It should make members of Congress wary of future challenges from economic progressives. Clinton is politically savvy. Like most centrist Democrats, she has been acutely sensitive to the concerns of the donor class throughout her political career. The Sanders candidacy should convince her to be just as attentive to the kitchen-table concerns of Americans in the bottom 90 percent.Some of Clinton's supporters, including liberal economist Brad DeLong, argue that Clinton should consolidate the party's base by lying to Sanders backers until the election, and then ""gleefully and comprehensively trash"" them after victory in November. [Update: DeLong says he didn't advocate deception, but rather wants Clinton supporters to hold off on attacks until after the election. He supports an eventual comeuppance for ""people to be named later"" who peddled ""Guevarista fantasies"" and engaged in ""Comintern-scale lying.""]This strategy would put the future of the Democratic Party in grave jeopardy. Severe economic inequality has clearly rocked the American electorate. Waving this fact away to punish intraparty enemies will not change the underlying economic conditions that have buoyed both Sanders and Republican candidate Donald Trump. And the demographic data could not be starker. Sanders has simply crushed Clinton among voters under 30. A majority of all millennials -- not just those who identify with the Democratic Party -- now do not even support capitalism. And after coming of professional age during the Great Recession, who can blame them?For all his democratic socialist branding, Sanders is a pretty conventional New Dealer -- the kind of politician who dominated the Democratic Party for most of the 20th century. And the success of his populist message, particularly with young people, shows where the party is heading, whether its leaders like it or not. "

8,POLITICS,Rick Snyder Wants Obama To Drink Flint Water,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-snyder-obama-flint-water_us_5728bd0fe4b096e9f08f226a,The Michigan governor has been trying to get the city's residents to use their taps.,2016-05-03,President Barack Obama is visiting Flint on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_16_158_3895_2140%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) hopes President Barack Obama has a drink when he visits Flint on Wednesday. Snyder has been trying to get Flint residents to trust Environmental Protection Agency assurances that their water is safe to drink when it's filtered. ""We are hopeful the president will drink the water in Flint, to help reinforce Gov. Snyder’s actions and the EPA’s message that filtered Flint water is safe to drink,"" Snyder spokeswoman Anna Heaton told The Huffington Post in an emailed statement. Testing shows unfiltered Flint water is still dangerous. High lead levels have poisoned residents' taps since the city started pumping from the Flint River in April of 2014 and failed to treat the water correctly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of filters, Snyder drank from a Flint resident's tap last month. He vowed to continue to drink the city's water for at least 30 days. Flint mayor Karen Weaver dismissed Snyder's water drinking as a publicity stunt. She urged people who are pregnant, nursing or under the age of 6 to keep drinking bottled water. White House press secretary Josh Earnest suggested Monday that Obama wouldn't sample Flint's water during his visit. “I’m not aware of any photo ops that involve the president’s consumption of the water,” Earnest said.He added that Flint residents should follow the government's guidance on water consumption -- and Obama would do the same.""I certainly would encourage people to listen to the advice that they get from our scientific and public health experts about what water is safe to drink and the president will certainly follow that advice,"" he said.The White House did not have any additional comment on the matter on Tuesday morning. Flint residents might be a little skeptical of the government's advice on water because authorities insisted it was safe, even though it was brown and funky for 18 months. State regulators told the city not to treat the source water with anti-corrosion chemicals that can reduce the amount of metals leached from lead pipes connected to people's homes. Researchers discovered high amounts of lead in Flint kids' blood last fall, prompting Snyder's government to tell people not to drink the water and take emergency measures.Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that can permanently damage children's developing brains. Lead poisoning has emerged as a possible explanation of surging crime rates in the 20th century. Snyder has repeatedly apologized for his government's handling of the Flint water crisis, though he has also blamed the EPA for not acting decisively when it learned of high lead levels in Flint's water last summer. When Obama announced his Flint visit last week, Snyder initially said he wouldn't have time to meet with the president. The governor has since reversed course and said he wants to meet with Obama. Snyder, Weaver and the EPA have been encouraging Flint residents to at least run their taps. Paradoxically, reduced water usage has slowed improvement to the city's water infrastructure. ""The very low water use rates in some Flint homes hinders recovery of the system due to the improved corrosion control,"" Virginia Tech researchers Kelsey Pieper and Marc Edwards wrote in a blog post last month. Pieper and Edwards are part of a team from the university that has been testing water samples from Flint homes. ""Less water use means that the orthophosphate and chlorine added to help improve the water quality and reduce lead and bacteria, are not flowing through the homes as much as is desired.""Clarification: Because Siddhartha Roy's name appears on the Virginia Tech blog post, an earlier version of this story attributed the post to him instead of Kelsey Pieper and Marc Edwards.

A security guard escorts the man out and is heard warning him that if he comes back he will be arrested for trespassing.In one particularly scary incident in Bradley, Illinois, on Monday, police say they were called about an active shooter situation after a 39-year-old man created a disturbance inside a Target store.Responding officers found no firearm, but did arrest Michael Merichko for disorderly conduct, they said.Several other videos, one listed as filmed in Hendersonville, Tennessee, seen above, shows similar men creating a disturbance inside stores.Many of the men in the videos are seen wearing neon yellow T-shirts. One reads: “Repent or Perish.”Not all Christians are preaching the same hate, however. And the concern for the safety of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals who wish to use whatever restroom they choose is a valid concern.In a recent HuffPost blog post, Rev. Emily C. Heath of the United Church of Christ opened up about the danger transgender individuals are placed in by some of these LGBT opponents. Heath, who is married to a woman, identifies as a gender non-conforming person who has faced scrutiny while trying to use a women’s restroom.“I am lucky in that the worst that has ever happened to me in a women’s room is that I’ve been embarrassed. Friends of mine have not been so lucky,” Heath wrote while acknowledging a constant, personal fear of what could happen.“The other night I read about a woman who has decided to bring her gun into restrooms from now on in order to ‘protect’ herself from ‘perverts’ who come in. To be clear, that meant anyone that she thought didn’t belong in a women’s room. Shoot first. Ask questions later,” Heath wrote.Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the state where the Portland incident occurred. This has been corrected."

The Metropolitan Police Department released a video Monday that shows the assailant yelling at the Muslim woman outside a Starbucks at 9 p.m. on the evening of April 21. ""A Caucasian lady with blond hair walked right past me,"" the Muslim woman, who was wearing a hijab during the the assault, told WJLA. ""Then as soon as she sat down she started talking about me. Saying 'F-ing Muslim. Trash, worthless piece of Muslim trash. You all need to go back to where you came from.'""The Muslim woman, whose identity has not been made public, managed to record part of the incident. In the recording, the other woman can be heard saying ""You're a terrorist. So stupid,"" according to WJLA.The victim says the assailant also made her political allegiance clear.""She says if Donald Trump wins the nomination I'm going to vote for him so he can send all of you all back to where you came from,"" the Muslim woman told WJLA. Feeling scared, the Muslim woman called 911, and an MPD officer came to the scene. But according to a statement from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is working with the victim, the officer told the Muslim woman there was nothing he could do because of ""freedom of speech.""As soon as the officer left, the victim said, the blond woman resumed shouting at her and then briefly left the scene. When she returned, she poured an unknown liquid over the Muslim woman's head from a bottle, which can be seen in the security footage above.""It didn't burn my skin or anything, but it had a strange smell to it,"" the Muslim woman told WJLA. She called 911 again and filed a police report. The MPD is now investigating the incident as a simple assault and a suspected hate crime. According to David Benowitz, a criminal defense attorney at Price Benowitz LLP, a simple assault charge in D.C. requires evidence of ""physical touching or attempted physical touching"" or ""words or actions that create a reasonable fear of bodily injury."" For the officer who responded to the victim's first 911 call, it might have been a ""tough call"" as to whether to arrest the blond woman, Benowitz explained. It would have been up to the officer to decide whether the blond woman's words could ""arguably be called political speech,"" or whether they were enough to create a ""reasonable fear of bodily injury."" But when the assailant poured liquid over the Muslim woman's head, Benowitz added, it ""definitely"" warranted a charge of simple assault, because the assailant ""crossed into that person's physical space."" The attack comes amid a frightening surge in anti-Muslim rhetoric from Trump and others in the Republican primary since the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernandino, California, as well as a corresponding rise in violence directed at American Muslims. Trump, who is inching ever closer to the Republican nomination, has called for a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. and described Islam as a religion that ""hates us."" At a campaign rally last week, he trotted out one of his favorite anecdotes, about a U.S. general killing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig's blood, a story that is not supported by any evidence.Last month, a man planning an armed anti-Muslim rally in Georgia expressed his support for Trump. In March, a Muslim student and a Hispanic student were allegedly attacked in Kansas by a man who called them ""brown trash,"" told them to ""go home"" and yelled ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" And in December, a Trump supporter was arrested in a plot to bomb a mosque.The Huffington Post has in recent months has documented the near-daily acts of harassment, violence and discrimination faced by Muslims in the U.S. And a report released Monday by the Bridge Initiative at Georgetown University states that there were more acts of anti-Muslim violence and vandalism in 2015 than in any year since the Sept. 11 attacks. The Muslim woman who was assaulted in D.C. told KJLA that the incident has left her scared. ""I'm more nervous than ever and I've lived over here for six years,"" she said.D.C. police are offering up to $1,000 as a reward to anyone who can provide information leading to the arrest of the woman seen in the security footage. If the woman is arrested and charged with simple assault, she could face up to 180 days in prison. A hate crime charge, Benowitz said, would raise the maximum sentence to 270 days in prison.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

A theme park in Japan is preparing to open a ""Kingdom of the Robot"" land run by more than 200 androids who will cook, bartend, serve and bus tables for visitors. The park is Huis Ten Bosch in Nagasaki, and its robot realm will open in July, Hideo Sawada, president of the theme park's operating company, told the Nikkei Asian Times. You may have already heard about the robot hotel inside the theme park, where animatronic women and T. rex dinosaurs help guests check in for their stays and even carry luggage, along with human backup. The forthcoming robot kingdom is intended to cut costs and serve as a testing ground for new robot technology, the Nikkei Asian Review says. ""Robots will arrive in this kingdom one after another, and the time will come when those technologies will be in use worldwide,"" Sawada said. Whoa.But the weirdest part is that this isn't even the theme park's strangest quirk. Although located in Japan, Huis Ten Bosch was a built to look exactly like the Netherlands.Yup, we're talking windmills, tulips, clogs and canals... in Nagasaki. Check it out:Huis Ten Bosch looks just like a 17th-century Dutch village, a nod to an old Japanese trade agreement with Dutch sailors from the 1600s, Atlas Obscura explains. While roaming streets of neatly-organized tulips and canals, visitors can also witness a show that re-enacts Holland's historic ""great flood"" and tour a model of an authentic Dutch sailing ship....And soon, a robot skipper may join them, too. All aboard!"
14,POLITICS,What About Hillary Clinton's Gaffes?,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-gaffes_us_5728d8efe4b096e9f08f43d6,"Donald Trump is the post-gaffe candidate, but Clinton doesn't seem as lucky.",2016-05-03,Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton has made her share of gaffes during this year's presidential campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5728ea462200002900255576.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During the 2012 election, Democrats excoriated GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney over his penchant for making gaffes -- effectively portraying him as an awkward, out-of-touch candidate who says the wrong things at the wrong time.The narrative even dogged Romney during a trip abroad to Poland. Following another round of embarrassing headlines, the candidate was subjected to a reporter's now-infamous inquiry: ""What about your gaffes?""Four years later, amid what is shaping up to be a nasty showdown between GOP hopeful Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the media's thirst for gaffes has receded a bit.As HuffPost's Jason Linkins wrote last month, Trump's ""hallucinatory presence and constant stream of cuckoo-bananas balderdash have essentially made the gaffe entirely irrelevant."" The brash businessman ""doesn’t have momentary lapses. He is a constant, walking lapse of good sense, taste and judgment.""This, coupled with Trump's refusal to apologize for anything -- even when presented with video evidence of misconduct by his campaign or supporters -- has effectively neutered the gaffe outrage machine. Burned by prior mistaken prognoses, the media has learned to think twice before declaring the mogul's latest off-the-wall utterances as the beginning of ""the end of Trump.""But Clinton hasn't gotten the same pass from the press -- a development that has not gone unnoticed by her likely opponent.Trump, a self-professed foe of political correctness, railed against Clinton on Monday for saying she can handle men who go “off the reservation.”“The Indians have gone wild on that statement,” he said, thus airing his own offensive comment in the process of condemning Clinton. “The Indians have said that that statement is a disastrous statement, and they want a retraction.”A Clinton campaign staffer later tweeted that the Democrat ""meant no disrespect to Native Americans. She wants this election to be about lifting people up, not tearing them down.""The dustup is just the latest in a series of Clinton flubs this year. At a CNN town hall meeting in March, the former secretary of state said ""we are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" The comments didn't land well in West Virginia this week, when a laid-off coal worker asked Clinton how ""you can come in here and tell us how you’re going to be our friend.""Clinton apologized, saying her remarks were ""totally out of context from what I meant, because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time.""She offered another mea culpa last month after praising the late Nancy Reagan for addressing the AIDS epidemic when ""nobody would talk about it."" As first lady, Reagan turned her back on LGBT people suffering from the virus.Then there was Clinton's odd participation in a racially tinged joke by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio about ""CP time,"" which is slang for ""colored people's time."" The exchange drew a rebuke from President Barack Obama at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner. Obama said ""CP time"" stands for ""jokes white people should not make.”It remains to be seen whether these gaffes will truly sway voters at the ballot box. But it is easy to imagine Trump fanning the flames at such moments in the general election -- either via Twitter or his viselike grip on cable news -- to drown out Clinton's message. Democratic strategist and former Martin O'Malley spokeswoman Lis Smith told The Huffington Post that Clinton's gaffes ""speak to how she's neither a natural communicator nor comfortable with the norms and lexicon of 21st-century progressives. It's not dissimilar from her use of the term 'illegal immigrants.'""But, Smith added, Clinton maintains an advantage against a candidate like Trump, whose unfavorability numbers have reached near-historic levels.""I don't think these types of comments will do her any favors in terms of 'winning' media cycles or endearing her to the skeptical left,"" Smith said. ""But, against Trump, they won't do her lasting harm, either.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

There was a third incident, also last year, that did not lead to charges. It's a federal offense to point a laser at a law enforcement officer or aircraft.The FBI offers rewards of up to $10,000, for information leading to the arrest of anyone who points a laser at an aircraft. This is because it can pose a major danger to its pilots, passengers and those on the ground if the operator is blinded or injured by the light.Coast Guard Capt. Joe Raymond echoed that sentiment regarding vessels.“Firing a laser at a vessel is extremely dangerous and directly interferes with the safe movement of commercial vessels and the Coast Guard’s ability to conduct search and rescue operations,” he said in a statement. “I encourage individuals who witness laser attacks on commercial vessels and Coast Guard small boats and aircraft to call 911.”Despite the serious repercussions, lasers being shone at emergency personnel, aircraft, and other vehicles continues to be an ongoing issue.Less than a week before Raden was formally fined for his actions, the Coast Guard said one of their boatcrews was hit by a similar green laser near Bellingham, Washington. The effect ended their life-saving training operations because of medical concerns.“As a safety authority, we are very concerned about these incidents causing accidents or delaying emergency responses,” Cmdr. Brian Meier said in a release.The Coast Guard said it is asking for the public's help in identifying the person responsible. Anyone with information can contact their local Coast Guard unit or local law enforcement."
16,POLITICS,How Down-Ballot Candidates Are Dealing With The Prospect Of Donald Trump,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-down-ballot_us_57275cb6e4b01a5ebde60bf0,Democrats are whacking some Republicans for supporting the controversial presidential contender.,2016-05-02,Down-ballot candidates from both parties are planning for the increasingly likely event of Donald Trump securing the GOP nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57277508220000360025520f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If he wins the Indiana primary on Tuesday, as polls indicate he will, Donald Trump will have all but clinched the Republican presidential nomination. GOP officials and even the rival campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) have begun to see the writing on the wall, preparing for the prospect of a toxic candidate at the top of the ticket.Down-ballot candidates in both parties are likewise trying to figure out what a Trump nomination will mean for their own electoral chances. With Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee, Democrats are feeling increasingly confident that they'll be able to flip as many as 10 seats in the GOP-controlled Senate. They also say that Trump could put the House of Representatives in play -- though this would be a tall order, given the large Republican majority there. But Trump's approval ratings among general-election voters, which are almost unprecedentedly low, could make that scenario possible.Democrats are already trying to associate down-ballot GOP candidates with some of Trump's more controversial remarks. Conner Eldridge, a Democrat challenging Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), posted a video to YouTube on Monday that excoriates Trump for his various statements about women. The video goes on to call Boozman a ""Trump enabler"" for vowing to support the businessman if he becomes the nominee. It's most likely a preview of what's to come this fall if Trump secures the nomination and faces former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election.Top Trump adviser Paul Manafort over the weekend said that Trump will help Republicans in the House and Senate raise campaign funds if he becomes the party’s presidential nominee. But it's doubtful that vulnerable Republicans in swing states, like Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio) or Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.), would even want to be seen in the same room as the real estate mogul. In fact, Kirk has said he plans to skip the GOP convention in Cleveland this summer, and Portman -- who, as an Ohio senator, can't exactly avoid the proceedings altogether -- told reporters that he plans to spend ""very little"" time there.The bare-knuckle clash between Trump and Cruz is also having an effect on down-ballot Republican races. An ad posted to YouTube on Monday for Mike Pape, who is running for Kentucky's 1st Congressional District, presents him as a candidate on whom Trump fans and Cruz supporters can agree. In the spot, a voter wearing a Trump hat and a voter wearing a Cruz T-shirt bond over their admiration of Pape, describing him as ""a trusted conservative"" who'll ""make America great again."" (Get it? Because Cruz's slogan is ""TrusTed,"" and... yeah.)The ad is Pape's second attempt at bridging the divide between the two polarized camps. In April, he released a spot that described him as the candidate who can “help Trump build the wall"" and also ""help Ted Cruz repeal Obamacare."" It's a unique way of trying to consolidate support in Kentucky, where Trump fended off Cruz in March's caucus by nearly 10,000 votes. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Ultimately, Sandusky, 72, who was an assistant to famed head coach Joe Paterno, aims to be granted a new trial.Sandusky is serving 30 to 60 years in prison after being convicted of molesting 10 boys at Penn State University athletic facilities or at events held by his charity, The Second Mile. Dozens of other boys, including his adopted son, have accused the former coach of abusing them.At Monday's hearing in Centre County Court of Common Pleas in Bellefonte, Visiting Judge John Cleland expressed skepticism about the petition for post-conviction relief, saying it did not appear to meet legal requirements.He said Sandusky's lawyers failed to properly certify that any witnesses they would call at a hearing would back up the allegations outlined in the petition.Sandusky's lawyer, Alexander Lindsay, told the judge that many of the certifications he presented in the petition were based on what he believed a witness would likely say at an evidentiary hearing.Lindsay said that was the best he could do because Cleland denied him permission last autumn to force potential witnesses to talk to him. Cleland had said he based that decision on a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling.""I'm mystified what I'm supposed to do,"" Lindsay said in court as Sandusky listened intently, occasionally whispering to co-counsel Andrew Salemme.In a related ruling on Monday, the judge said Sandusky's lawyers could attempt to show that prosecutors improperly leaked grand jury evidence to former Harrisburg Patriot-News reporter Sara Ganim, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her expose of the case.Cleland gave Lindsay permission to call Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane to testify whether she believes Frank Fina, one of the Sandusky prosecutors, leaked the secret testimony.Kane suggested as much in court documents filed in her own criminal case involving a charge of leaking grand jury information in a different case.During Monday's hearing, Sandusky flashed a grin and waved to several people in the courtroom but made no public statement.In a written statement read by Salemme at a news conference after the session, the former coach said: ""I am innocent of these heinous crimes.""Prison officials say Sandusky remains in protective custody, locked in his cell 23 hours a day.There is no timetable for Cleland's ruling on an evidentiary hearing for Sandusky.
