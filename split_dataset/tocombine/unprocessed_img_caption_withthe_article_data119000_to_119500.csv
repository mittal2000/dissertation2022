So he probably wasn't happy on Friday morning, when the Washington Post's official fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, sided with the people who think McCain flip-flopped on Bergdahl.McCain told Jake Tapper on Thursday that, although he previously expressed his willingness to exchange prisoners for Bergdahl, he would never have done so if he'd known exactly which prisoners would be exchanged. Kessler, though, poked some big holes in that argument:We fully appreciate that the details of a prisoner exchange are important, and McCain certainly made that caveat clear. But since the deal was announced, he has suggested that the question of trading the Taliban Five for Bergdahl was a surprise—and that’s certainly not the case. These five men were always part of the prisoner swap, so that is not a detail that can be in dispute. Indeed, only a day after The Washington Post revealed a deal was in the works to trade the five men for Bergdahl, McCain appeared on television with what was billed as a “new position.”Read more here."

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb757c6200000c701015da8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The two most exciting leadoff hitters in the National League this year have been Dee Gordon of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Billy Hamilton of the Cincinnati Reds. Both are young players with extraordinary speed who are racking up impressive stolen base numbers. Gordon has stolen 35 bases in 39 attempts, while Hamilton has stolen 22 bases in 29 attempts. These two players have been a big part of their team's success -- or at least that is what one would think based on the attention paid on these two phenoms. However, Gordon's Dodgers, expected by many to run away with the division are in second place, a full eight and half games back from the Giants. Hamilton's Reds are in four place and two games below .500.It is, of course, not fair to blame the Dodgers' and Reds' shortcomings entirely on their leadoff hitters, but it is also unfair to overlook the player who has been the leadoff hitter on the team with the best record in the National League thus far. Angel Pagan does not have the blinding speed of Hamilton or Gordon, nor is he a young player about whom fans can project a fifteen year career, but he has a higher OBP and more runs scored than either Gordon or Hamilton.Getting on base is the most important skill for a leadoff hitter, especially one like Pagan or Gordon who bat in front of power laden lineups. Pagan's .370 OBP is significantly higher than that of Gordon (.327) or Hamilton (.296). Hamilton's speed is an extraordinary tool, but more than 70 percent of the time Hamilton has come to bat it has not helped him because he has not been able to reach first base safely. Runs scored is a counting statistic that is also very dependent on the performance of teammates, two more runs than Gordon (33 to 31) and nine more than Hamilton. Pagan has come to bat 18 fewer times than Gordon and about 25 percent more times than Hamilton, but not some of the disparity.The Oxymoron, as Pagan is known by some Giants fans, or maybe just by me and my sons, is a big reason why the Giants have done so well in 2014. The Giants have a top heavy lineup with productive, but erratic sluggers filling the 2-6 slots. Pagan's ability to get on base, steal a few bases, and take the extra base when needed has helped the team surprise many with its strong offense, good for third in the league in runs per game, this season. Pagan's success, and his impact on the Giants this year, is a reminder that behind all the language about being a spark plug, making things happen, or adding a different dimension to the game, batting leadoff is, to a great extent, a one-dimensional role. That one dimension is getting on base. Players who cannot fill that one role cannot be great leadoff hitters. It is possible that Gordon and Hamilton will improve their OBPs and be able to mature into top level leadoff hitters, but there are no guarantees of that. At their current pace, Gordon will likely evolve into a bottom-of-the-order middle infielder who brings some speed and defense to the game and Hamilton into a fourth outfielder, or a bottom of the order hitter charged with playing good defense and using his speed whenever possible. If Hamilton and Gordon do not grow better at reaching first base, but remain in the leadoff spot it will be due to bad and risk averse managing rather than their actual value.Speed is, of course, part of the skill set of most leadoff hitters, but it is peripheral. The greatest leadoff hitter of all time was Rickey Henderson, who is also the game's greatest base stealer, but Henderson was a great leadoff hitter because over the course of his career he reached base safely 40 percent of the time he came to the plate, and finished in the top ten in his league in OBP 16 times. His 1,406 stolen bases in 1,741 tries made him a better leadoff hitter, but stealing bases was not his core source of value.While a leadoff hitter who is extremely slow, probably would be a poor fit for that role, a fast player who either does not get on base much or who is really a power hitter with speed are much worse fits. Batting order is not the most important decision facing a manager, and batting Gordon and Hamilton leadoff, at least to see if they can do it, is not a terrible decision, but right now neither of them are better than the player at the top of the Giants order."
4,IMPACT,"Whoopi Goldberg Keeps It Real at Prison College Graduation, Discussing Her Shortcomings","Dominic Carter, ContributorPolitical television reporter, FiOS-TV/RNN; Author, 'No Momma'...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whoopi-goldberg-keeps-it-_b_5460542.html,,2014-06-06,2014-06-06-HudsonLink_2014SingSingGraduation2818.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-06-HudsonLink_2014SingSingGraduation2818-thumb.jpg,"Whoopi Goldberg has been in a lot of movies. The Color Purple, Sister Act, and I'll admit, one of my favorite Goldberg movies, when she played the female coach of the professional New York Knicks basketball team, in Eddie.  The list could go on and on. How many people can ever say they won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy and a Tony Award? There was the movie with the late Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in Ghost, the one woman show on Broadway, and of course, there is Goldberg on television these days as a host on The View.  But here comes Whoopi Goldberg in a different light. A very positive one! Up front and personal. We all know that most of the time, with some Hollywood types, what you see is not always what you get. You can click here to see the story I did on TV.  Here was Goldberg at a maximum security prison. The graduation speaker for a highly successful program called, ""Hudson Link,"" a program that raises private dollars to pay for college educations for prison inmates. ""Hudson Link"" was just recently the focus on an HBO documentary, and I was very proud to be the emcee for their annual fundraiser.  Here was Goldberg, arriving at the prison in Ossining New York more than an hour before the graduation. Without much fanfare, she walked in and did what many might consider the unthinkable. She bee-lined to the graduate area and maneuvered around, in this case, the regular visiting room where family members came to see their locked-up loved ones, which was now the make-shift area for the ceremony. Goldberg talked to each and every one of the inmates as the new graduates put on their caps and gowns.  Whoopi Goldberg was so unassuming, and the graduates in return were so thankful. There is irony in all of this. They may have long histories as hardened criminals, but they also admitted to Goldberg that yes, even in a state maximum security prison, the men watch her and the other ladies of The View.  Sometimes, in life it's amazing what you can overcome.  I recall growing up and feeling that I was one of the dumbest kids ever to come from the N.Y.C. public school system, but later, would go on to obtain an education, and even appear on Face the Nation, as a journalist discussing Caroline Kennedy's interest in the U.S Senate, or the fact that I have moderated a debate with Hillary Clinton.At this graduation, it was Goldberg's turn to discuss her shortcomings.   Without notes, and speaking from the heart, Goldberg told the graduates about her learning disability being dyslectic and having never attended college, but she talked about how her mother always believed in her, and said, ""Baby, that (college) may not be for you, but there are other things.""  It was so fitting for Goldberg to publically talk about her short-comings and what she had to overcome. Basically, illustrating what I say in my speeches, in life, we all fall down. The question is, do you get back up?The class valedictorian, a young man by the name of William Brown, told the audience in his speech that he almost turned down his opportunity because he worried if he would be inadequate, if he would be at a loss of words.  Well, William with his black cap on, and tassel to the side, did just fine. His family was there, expressing tremendous tears of joy, and I watched them cry during his speech. The Brown family had put off retiring to stand by their son. His father, William Brown, mother, Victoria Brown, and Aunt Judith Little were in attendance. His mother told me:""I feel very proud of him,"" with her voice trembling, and her husband rubbing her back in full support ""...for the way he has dealt with everything in his life, and especially being here.""Another family at the Mercy College Graduation were loved ones of graduate Mark Boatswain. Mark received his Associate Degree, and his mother, Elaine Barnett, and sister, Marsha Thomas couldn't have been happier.   The families.Think about this for a moment, after all the years of seeing a loved one in prison, and the turmoil that comes with that. At least on this day, the families were on top of the world.   So Whoopi Goldberg was giving back to the community, but so are the educators, the ones that put their life on the line going into these correctional institutions. I talked to seven-year English Literature and Composition professor JoAnn Skousen. Skousen reminded me of my wife, Marilyn Carter, a life-long educator, who years ago in the upstate Cortland N.Y area, took tremendous pride teaching at juvenile detention centers. Part of me, never understood it. So I put my question to professor Skousen, and found her answer amazing.Professor, you been doing this for seven years. Are you worried about your safety?""That's a really good question. It's a question a lot of people ask me. These are maximum security prisoners. They have reasons that they are here, and I'm always aware of that. I know there is a reason they are behind bars, but no, I have never once felt threatened or worried. These men are so respectful, so appreciative, So honorable, they would protect me with their lives if they needed too, and I always sensed that. So I've never been worried, never been scared.I followed up. ""Why do you do what you do, professor?""I do it because I want to change lives, and I know that education changes lives. I appreciate that this is not a penal institution. It is a correctional facility. I feel in many ways, I'm correcting what went wrong, and helping them become different people so that when go on the outside they are ready to serve the community and be a part of it.Maybe I'm getting old, only days away from the milestone of my 50th birthday, but the response of professor Skousen brings tears to my eyes. This woman, surrounded by alleged hardened criminals in a classroom, just knew that right was on her side. You could see it in her eyes. My experience in life has shown me that one person; yes, one determined person can change the world.It was also the first Mercy College graduation for President Timothy L. Hall. Just three weeks ago the new president arrived from Tennessee, and was bursting with pride at the graduation.I have to admit, I did not start out supporting this program, a college education for prison inmates (and I raised that opposition to Goldberg and another entertainer that supports it, Harry Belafonte. You can see the interviews here). But look at the millions it saves tax-payers. Again, the money for Hudson Link is privately raised, and it saves tax-payers because only a handful of their graduates have ever returned to prison, which in New York State costs about 60,000 a year per inmate. You do the math.""There aren't many programs that I know of where you can spend a dollar here, and get a 12 dollar return there. It makes percent sense."" Said Sean Pica-Hudson Link. Another Hudson Link official put it this way.""There is a big difference between incarceration, and rehabilitation. The men that are graduating here are the ultimate example of what rehabilitation can mean when we as a society look at them as men, not as prisoners,"" said Christian French-Hudson Link Board President.The new graduates will never forget that someone like Whoopi Goldberg took time out her day to travel two hours outside New York City to attend their graduation, they will never forget Professor Skousen, that someone believed in them, or their families that have been there in bad times and now in good ones."
5,SPORTS,Breaking Down Colin Kaepernick's Contract Extension,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kaepernicks-contract-extension-breaking-down_n_5461309.html,,2014-06-06,"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick warms up before the NFL football NFC Championship game against the Seattle Seahawks Sunday, Jan. 19, 2014, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb757c72600003600834730.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joel Corry, National Football Post The San Francisco 49ers signed quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was under contract through the 2014 season, to a contract extension on Wednesday making him the NFL’s second highest paid player (by average salary). When news of the deal broke, it was announced as a six-year, $126 million extension with an NFL record $61 million in guarantees. Technically, these descriptions of the deal are accurate but also misleading.Instead of making $1,073,766 in the final year of a rookie deal signed in 2011, Kaepernick gets $13,073,766, a $12 million raise, this year. The $13,073,766 is a $12,328,766 signing bonus, a fully guaranteed $645,000 2014 base salary ($428,766 less than his rookie deal base salary) and a $100,000 workout bonus. This workout bonus was incorporated into the new deal from Kaepernick’s rookie contract.Only $12,973,766 of the $61 million in guarantees is fully guaranteed at signing. The remaining $48,026,234 consists of Kaepernick’s $12.4 million 2015 base salary, $13.9 million 2016 base salary, $16.5 million 2017 base salary and $5,226,234 of his $17 million 2018 base salary. The injury guarantees become fully guaranteed if Kaepernick is on the roster on April 1 in each specific contract year (i.e.; 2015 base salary becomes guaranteed on April 1, 2015).The 2011 second round pick has unguaranteed $18.8 million and $21 million base salaries in 2019 and 2020. Annual $400,000 workout bonuses begin in 2015. There are per game active roster bonuses totaling $2 million ($125,000 per game) in each of the extension years (2015-2020). The per game amount is only payable if Kaepernick is on the 46-man active roster for that particular game. For example, if Kaepernick suffers a season-ending injury in San Francisco’s eighth game during the 2015 season, he would only earn $1 million of his $2 million 2015 roster bonus.Kaepernick also has a $2 million per year base salary de-escalator. His 2015 base salary won’t decrease by the $2 million if he is named first or second team All-Pro by the Associated Press or the 49ers reach the Super Bowl while he has 80 percent playtime during the regular season and playoffs (Wild Card, Division and Conference Championship games) in 2014. Once Kaepernick reaches this threshold in a season, the de-escalator voids for the remainder of the deal. Kaepernick’s 2018 injury guarantee will increase by the amount of de-escalation in 2015 through 2017. For example, if Kaepernick’s base salary decreases by $2 million in each of these three years, his 2018 injury guarantee is $11,226,234.The 49ers are using an additional $2,136,987 of salary cap room on Kaepernick under the new contract. His 2014 cap number goes from $1,630,457 to $3,767,444. Kaepernick’s 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 cap numbers are $17,265,753, $18,765,253, $21,365,753, $21,865,753, $21.2 million and $23.4 million. The 49ers have built additional cap flexibility into Kaepernick’s contract because they can create cap room at any time during the deal with their discretionary right to convert a portion of his base salary into a signing bonus.Kaepernick’s deal has a team-friendly structure, as do all of the lucrative deals negotiated by San Francisco in recent years. The 49ers weren’t going to abandon established contractual precedents for Kaepernick. The April 1 contract guarantee date is the norm with the team’s deals. The other lucrative deals just aren’t quite as team-friendly as Kaepernick’s. His per game roster bonuses are tied with Frank Gore for the highest on the team. Most of the top quarterback contracts don’t contain per game roster bonuses. Only Aaron Rodgers and Jay Culter have them. Salary de-escalators in NFL contracts are unusual unless they are for off-season workout program participation. The concept used with Kaepernick seems to be taken from teammate Ahmad Brooks’ contract. Brooks’ base salary can de-escalate by a maximum of $2.5 million in each year depending upon his sack total in the prior year.Kaepernick’s lack of contract security is glaring, particularly for a lucrative quarterback deal. Jay Cutler, Tony Romo and Matt Ryan have $38 million, $40 million and $42 million fully guaranteed at signing, respectively, in their contracts, which is essentially triple Kaepernick’s amount. His modest signing bonus ($12,328,766) and the conditional guarantees make the deal a year-to-year proposition from the outset because the 49ers can part ways with Kaepernick at any time without adverse cap consequences. For example, $9,368,493 of cap room would be gained in 2016 by releasing Kaepernick before his $11.4 million base salary (assumes he didn’t extinguish the de-escalator mechanism with his 2014 or 2015 performance) becomes fully guaranteed on April 1. The 49ers would have a $7,397,260 cap charge or dead money from signing bonus proration in Kaepernick’s 2017 through 2019 contract years accelerating onto the 2016 cap. Kaepernick probably would have been better protected with the signing and option bonus structure of NaVorro Bowman’s contract.Kaepernick’s extremely team-friendly structure (modest signing bonus, conditional guarantees, big per game roster bonuses, salary de-escalators) is something other clubs will try to employ in future negotiations. It would be a big surprise if the agents for Can Newton, Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson agree to Kaepernick’s structure when their clients get new deals.Follow me on Twitter: @corryjoelJoel Corry is a former sports agent who helped found Premier Sports & Entertainment, a sports management firm that represents professional athletes and coaches.

It has been a year since the deadly explosion that killed 15 people, yet despite investigations that have yielded new information about safety deficiencies at the plant in West and voluntary safety steps taken by the fertilizer industry, there hasn't been a single state or federal law passed since the explosion requiring change. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cc44200000070201cf9d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A federal working group released a report Friday that details how the government can improve chemical plant safety and security, more than a year after the deadly explosion at a West, Texas, fertilizer plant.The proposals were submitted to President Barack Obama, who directed federal agencies to suggest changes after the April 2013 explosion, which killed 15 and injured several hundred others. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor, the Department of Homeland Security, and related agencies submitted potential proposals to the administration in January. Friday's report builds on those suggestions and proposes actions that would improve community preparedness, improve data management, and update federal policies and regulations. The report lays out timelines for implementing the proposals, and includes specific ways to improve handling of ammonium nitrate, the chemical that caused the Texas blast. There are short-term suggestions, to be undertaken in the next year, and longer-term term solutions, to be implemented by the end of 2016. Environmental, health, labor, and social justice groups have been calling on the administration toughen standards on chemical facilities, which they say are necessary to protect both workers and the communities near plants. Many have been pushing for the proposal to include stronger regulatory encouragement for companies to switch to chemicals that pose lower risk. Rick Hind, the legislative director at Greenpeace, said in an interview earlier this week that he hoped the proposal would include measures requiring facilities to ""utilize chemicals that are less toxic, less likely to explode, less likely, if they do escape, to pose harm to the communities nearby."" Instead, the proposal calls for ""voluntary guidance to make chemical operators aware of safer technology, processes, and alternative solutions.""The Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters, which represents a variety of groups advocating for improvements, issued a statement calling for the administration to prioritize measures that ""put prevention first"" as it moves forward.""While we are pleased the Working Group report included some of the recommendations made by the most endangered communities and workers, if the Obama Administration is serious about protecting workers and communities, the president must stand up for prevention requirements that include safer chemicals and processes,"" the Coalition said in a statement Friday. ""The people of West, Texas deserve better than the voluntary half-measures in today's report.""Environmental justice advocates, too, had been calling for a strong proposal, arguing that it will bring the most benefits for people who live near the factories, who often are low-income residents and people of color. ""I think it's very important and crucial that we get something that is really going to the heart of strengthening this prevention piece,"" said Dr. Robert Bullard, dean of the School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University, known as the father of the environmental justice movement. Improvements to chemical safety can't come fast enough, proponents said. ""Many of us have been making this argument for a long time, that there's a need for systematic improvements around high-risk chemicals,"" said Gerald Poje, a former member of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which investigates disasters. ""We have to become more pro-active.""The working group that produced the proposal said in a statement Friday that the report is ""a milestone, not an endpoint."" ""While the report describes many activities already undertaken to improve chemical facility safety and security, it also makes clear that much additional work is necessary to implement the consolidated action plan,"" the working group said.

(AP Photo/Jorge Sanchez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae9da5240000500096773e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito (D-East Harlem) honored one of the most popular anti-imperialist bands in the U.S. on Friday as the group’s frontman donned a T-shirt demanding freedom for a jailed Puerto Rican nationalist viewed by many of the island’s residents as a political prisoner. At Gracie Mansion ahead of Sunday’s Puerto Rican Day Parade, the elected officials bestowed René Pérez and Eduardo José Martínez of Latin hip-hop group Calle 13 with a proclamation praising the group for ""igniting minds, imaginations, and conversations around the world."" It would have seemed an odd sight just a few months ago, during the city's more conservative Bloomberg administration. Pérez was crowned the king of this year’s Puerto Rican Day Parade, which chose the liberation of Oscar López Rivera as one of its main themes. “They say that this is the country of freedom and human rights,” Pérez told The Huffington Post. “But if this were happening in another country, like Venezuela or China, people would say, ‘That’s a dictatorship.’” Noting that President Barack Obama had visited the Robben Island jail cell where former South Africa President Nelson Mandela spent most of his 28-year confinement as a political prisoner, Pérez added: “You’ve got a political prisoner in your own country.” López belonged to the Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by its Spanish initials as the FALN, which committed bombings, killings and kidnappings during the 1970s and 1980s in its efforts for Puerto Rican independence. He was convicted in 1980 of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 55 years in prison, with 15 years added later after he was found guilty of attempting to escape. He has spent 12 of his 33 years in jail so far in solitary confinement, according to Puerto Rican news agency Primera Hora. Those calling for his release say that at 71 years of age in an era in which the violent struggle for Puerto Rican independence has fizzled out, López no longer poses a threat. The Chicago-area bombings in which López was connected killed no one, and were intended to damage property rather than hurt people, according to Puerto Rican Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, who represents the island as a non-voting member of the U.S. Congress. The issue has widespread support on the island. Both Pierluisi and Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, who belong to opposing political parties, have called on the Obama administration to free López. U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), himself of Puerto Rican descent, has also pressed for López’s release. Wildly popular throughout Latin America as well as among Hispanics in the United States, Calle 13 has become known for its revolutionary politics as much as its eclectic rhythms and risqué lyrics. The band rages against the U.S. killing of Puerto Rican nationalist Filiberto Ojeda Ríos in “Querido FBI,” extends its solidarity to immigrants in “Pa’l Norte,” and offers an anthem to Latin American unity in “Latinoamérica.” Calle 13’s most recent album, “Multiviral,” features a guest appearance by WikiLeaks founder and U.S. government nemesis Julian Assange.Though de Blasio refrained from discussing Calle 13’s politics in his public remarks, the band’s anti-imperialist message likely strikes a personal chord with the mayor. As a young man, de Blasio supported the Central American solidarity movement, traveling to Nicaragua in 1988 during the left wing Sandinista government to distribute humanitarian aid. De Blasio’s support of the Sandinistas ran counter to that of the U.S. government at the time, which funded a right wing rebel army in Nicaragua known as the Contras during the Ronald Reagan presidency. A 1989 Human Rights Watch report describes the Contras as “major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners.” A corruption scandal had threatened to cast a shadow on this year’s Puerto Rican Day Parade. An investigation by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman revealed in February that the nonprofit that organizes the annual event had mismanaged $1.4 in corporate donations, according to the New York Daily News. But Councilwoman Mark-Viverito, the first Latina to serve as city council’s speaker, praised the reorganized board as she spoke to the crowd at Gracie Mansion on Friday. “Their efforts and the efforts of a community that is demanding accountability are bringing this parade back to its roots,” Mark-Viverito said. She applauded the parade’s new leadership for championing the cause of Oscar López, saying that previous parade organizers had “never wanted to highlight” demands for his release.Mark-Viverito said she chose to honor Calle 13 this year to send a message that those in positions of influence should use their fame to press for social change. “We have added responsibility to raise our voice,” Mark-Viverito said. “And that is what Calle 13 does.” In addition to López, this year's parade will pay tribute to the 100th anniversary of the birth of poet Julia de Burgos, as well as the 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers. Taking its name from the indigenous name of the island, ""Borinquen,"" the segregated Puerto Rican 65th Infantry Regiment fought in World Wars I and II and the Korean War, before being disbanded in 1959."

Several bystanders jumped in to help, seizing his gun. He was arrested minutes later by police, who said the suspect also was carrying a hunting knife and at least 50 rounds of shotgun ammunition. SUSPECT WAS COMMITTED TWICEIn a statement read to reporters on Friday, Brandes said: ""Mr. Ybarra suffers from significant and long-standing mental health issues, including delusions, that were in play during yesterday's tragedy.""I do not know at this point in time why Mr. Ybarra's illness brought him to Seattle Pacific University, but I can tell you that he recognizes the suffering of the victims and their families. He is sorry for their pain,"" she said.Brandes said she did not know the circumstances of his prior involuntary commitment. Police in Mountlake Terrace, a suburb south of Seattle, said on Friday that Ybarra had been detained and committed to mental health facilities twice after erratic behavior in 2010 and 2012, without giving any details.Citing unidentified police sources, local KIRO-TV said Ybarra had visited the Columbine high school in Colorado where two students killed a teacher and 12 classmates before taking their own lives in 1999.A 19-year-old SPU freshman who was shot during the rampage died a short time later. A 20-year-old woman remained hospitalized on Friday in serious condition in the intensive care unit, although she was conscious and breathing on her own.A 24-year-old man was in satisfactory condition with pellet wounds. A 22-year-old man was treated for minor injuries suffered in the scuffle with the suspect, police said.The bloodshed in Seattle marked the latest in a series of mass shootings at schools and other public places across the United States in recent years that have renewed a national debate over gun safety and mental illness.Two weeks ago, a 22-year-old man stabbed three people to death and fatally shot three others before taking his own life in a rampage across a college town near the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Life is hard. But Joe Miller has abandoned complexity in lieu of irresponsible soundbites. To make such a wildly inaccurate policy statement, purposefully and solely for short-term political gain, is a reprehensible breach of ethics and is beneath even the basement level of politics we associate with the modern day campaign.",2014-06-05,2014-06-02-joemillerthinksabortionisbankruptingsocialsecuritycover.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-02-joemillerthinksabortionisbankruptingsocialsecuritycover-thumb.jpg,"Joe Miller has a knack for Republican primaries. Obviously, there's a small sample size (one), but 2010's unlikely upset over Senator Lisa Murkowski -- as slim as the margin of victory was -- proved a successful strategy through a primary exploit. Miller found that he could overcome the odds by running as far to the right as possible, as loudly as he could.The general election returned Murkowski to Washington, D.C., and Miller now finds himself in his second run, this time attempting to overcome yet another slate of primary challengers currently polling above him.But if Miller is sweating the support deficit, it's not showing. And in a typical showing from the tea party candidate, a forum in Anchorage last week featured Miller sticking to his script. Applause lines were commonplace, as he called for abolishing the IRS, repealing Obamacare, nullifying federal laws, and saving the country from the tyrannical rule of President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. All of which is standard fare within Republican primary politics, as candidates push the measuring stick further to the right to rally their base and separate themselves from their opponents.A distinction needs to be made, however, between aspirational campaign speak used to solicit support, and outright false information that misleads voters and promulgates false information. When asked last week to share his vision of America that he would like to leave to the next generation, Miller fell on the latter side of the fence last week. Speaking to the crowd of a couple of hundred in Anchorage, he answered:The number one priority is to end the horror of abortion in this country. We've slaughtered 56 million children in this country, and it's even worse than that. Part of our technology has been involved with 1 billion plus that have been slaughtered worldwide. It is something that we will reap, in fact we are reaping right now, the consequences of. We have a country right now that we can't keep up on the Social Security demands. Why? Because we've slaughtered generations. Literally.Miller promoted Senator Rand Paul's (R-Kentucky) ""Life at Conception Act,"" which would fully outlaw abortion in the United States by declaring that human life begins at conception and guaranteeing 14th Amendment rights to fertilized eggs.The call to criminalize abortion drew applause and a few shouts of approval, and Miller moved on to other topics.The claim that Social Security represents an immediate crisis, though not wholly inaccurate, suffers from a heavy dose of editorializing. The latest trustees report from the Social Security Administration found that there is enough current funding to pay full benefits through 2033, and 75 percent of benefits through 2087. The outlook for the Social Security Disability Insurance program is a bit more worrisome in the short term. If Congress takes no action, benefits could start seeing cuts in 2016.There are many small changes that could stave off such cuts and make the program sustainable (there have been little changes since the Greenspan Commission in 1983). Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) has proposed raising the retirement age and reducing the growth of benefits for more affluent seniors. The Simpson-Bowles commission recommended increasing the cap on high-income earners, which currently cuts off taxing any income over $113,700. Sen. Begich introduced similar legislation last year.Social Security funding is not on a sustainable path and demands legislative redress. But the immediacy, assigned by Miller, is problematic. More troublesome, however, is the incorrect assertion that the trajectory of Social Security costs has the slightest thing to do with abortion -- let alone serves as the prime aggravating factor.The claim has been made more than once; Rick Santorum dusted it off in 2011, struggling to gain traction with primary voters during his failed presidential bid. But the idea first made its way into headlines back in 2007, from another Miller -- former U.S. Senator Zell Miller (D-Georgia). He painted with a much broader but similarly inaccurate brush: ""Over 45 million since Roe v. Wade in 1973,"" Miller told a pro-life gathering in Macon, Georgia. ""If those 45 million children had lived, today they would be defending our country, they would be filling our jobs, they would be paying into Social Security[.]""The comment rightly drew a lot of scrutiny, including from Freakonomics author and economist Steven Levitt, who has worked extensively on links between legalized abortion and crime statistics. Levitt remarked at the time that (Zell) Miller's findings were not dissimilar to his research, which found that legalized abortion reduced the number of unwanted children, and that had a correlating affect of reducing crime. But:Miller, however, makes a key mistake in his logic. While it is true there have been many millions of abortions... even if those abortions had not occurred, there would not be that many more Americans today. The reason is that the primary impact of an abortion is not to reduce a woman's lifetime number of children born, but rather, to simply shift the timing of a woman's fertility from early in life to later in life.... I would estimate that each teenage abortion reduces lifetime babies born to the mother by maybe one-tenth of a child, or possibly even less. (For a woman who gets an abortion in her forties, the impact is obviously larger, but there are very few of those type of abortions.) The key to our abortion argument is that women shift their births to a time when they can better care for the children.Both Millers' assertion that entire ""generations"" have been removed from paying into Social Security, causing its future funding problems, because of abortion is false.For points of comparison, we can use Zell Miller's accompanying claim that, in the U.S., ""3,700 babies are killed every single day[.]"" That statistic is, in itself, hard to verify. The Guttmacher Institute puts the figure closer to 2,900 (the abortion rate has been declining steadily from its spike in the early 1980s; 2011 showed abortion reaching its lowest level since 1973). Fifty-one percent of women who terminate pregnancies are 24 and under, supporting Levitt's finding that these women will likely give birth later in their lives. If terminated pregnancies are to be blamed for the lack of new citizens paying into Social Security, one should also note that 6,717 Americans have lost their lives in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 30,000 Americans die in automobile accidents every year, and from 1963 to 1991 that annual figure was above 40,000. Over 3,000 Americans die each year from the common flu.To be clear, this is not to equate abortion with war, fatal car crashes, or physical illness. But to isolate abortion as the primary driver of Social Security's insolvency is ludicrous and rife with nefarious intent.Abortion is a really difficult and complicated issue. Choice is hard. Life is hard. But Miller has abandoned complexity in lieu of irresponsible soundbites. To make such a wildly inaccurate policy statement, purposefully and solely for short-term political gain, is a reprehensible breach of ethics and is beneath even the basement level of politics we associate with the modern day campaign. He's taking the easy, angry road. We shouldn't allow ourselves to be dragged along for the ride."

A friend of mine recently told me about the Japanese art of Kintsugi. The legend goes that a Japanese shogun broke one of his favorite tea bowls and ordered it to be repaired. Unable to restore it to its original condition, his artisans came up with a technique of bonding the pieces back together with lacquer sprinkled with gold dust. The result was a one of a kind piece criss-crossed with shimmering threads, transforming an ordinary bowl into an ethereal work of art.To me there's a lovely lesson here about what beauty is and how to cultivate it.We keep telling ourselves that we should be flawless. When our lives falls short of our imaginary utopia, we get scared and lash out at ourselves and those we love. Our society worships perfection, photoshopping out wrinkles and bulges of our starving models. Defying gravity, we kick up the Botox and pump up the lips. The society pages are full of women who have that same deer in the headlights look that results from cranking your face up with a pulley. I once met a statuesque beauty queen who was the living incarnation of Barbie. She gleefully described trips to a plastic surgeon's office as akin to ""being at the candy shop.""   Americans spent the largest amount of money on cosmetic procedures last year since the great recession of 2008, totaling 12 billion dollars. Yep, that's billion with a ""B.""Do you know what that amount of money can buy? Nothing less than clean water for the entire planet. Not a pretty picture, y'all.You know what is the definition of true beauty, the kind that lasts? The kind that time and gravity can't take away?As our dearly departed Maya Angelou says, ""Nothing can dim the light that shines from within.""I know a college student who had a severe asthma attack and fell into a coma. Doctors thought she was certain to die, but after six weeks, Theresa De Vera stunned them all when she woke up one day. She was alive, but broken. She had to relearn everything -- how to dress herself, feed herself and how to talk. You can see her sweat with effort as her lips quivered to form even the simplest words. Still, she was determined to finish every sentence.De Vera eventually returned to college and got herself from class to class in her wheelchair, right up to her graduation ceremony. She became an advocate for the disabled. Recently, she won the title of Miss Wheelchair California. Her definition of beauty: ""Beauty is serving, knowing that you made a difference in someone else's life.""If you put De Vera next to Barbie in a ""true beauty"" contest together, De Vera wins. Hands down. Honestly, I don't know if I would have her strength, if the same thing happened to me. Nonetheless, I try my best with what I've got. When something breaks and doesn't go my way, first I get frustrated, but then I stop for a bit to give some love and attention to those jagged edges, knowing this is where true beauty is borne.De Vera's mantra: ""In my struggles, I found my strength.""This young woman has shown that if you stay true to myself, stretch yourself, learn from your experiences, and keep on going, eventually all the pieces will all come together, in a most unique way.In August, she will be competing for Miss Wheelchair America. On that stage she will be glowing from within, wearing her golden tiara, a Kintsugi incarnate."

Holder was announcing that a U.S. grand jury has charged five Chinese hackers with economic espionage and trade secret theft, the first-of-its-kind criminal charges against Chinese military officials in an international cyber-espionage case. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc137ae240000320076dc67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIJING -- When the U.S. Department of Justice announced its recent indictment against five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), the bilateral economic relationship between the U.S. and China effectively entered into ""Peaceful War"" mode, which is now in the public domain.This unprecedented 31-count criminal indictment involves corporate cyber-theft, cyber-espionage, and fraud by the PLA against leading U.S. companies. It has also reported that China stole American intellectual property at the rate of $300 billion a year -- the largest theft in human history, according to Time magazine.The question is: Will there be miscalculations that might launch a ""cool,"" if not cold, war between these two intractably interdependent economic superpowers?Unlike the Cold War period, however -- in which the Soviet Union was isolated from the global economy -- commercial interests and trade secrets seem to underpin the intrinsically entangled Sino-American economic relations. Security or EspionageFor the Obama administration, traditional espionage on enemies -- and even friends -- for national security reasons is fair game. Spying is as an old institution as prostitution; for millennia, it was common to have a circle of spying eunuchs and concubines in China. Likewise, the United States -- from the beginning of the Committee on Correspondence to the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency -- has had spying operations to protect the nation against potential domestic and foreign adversaries.The Justice Department, however, differentiated the distinction between spying for national security and the Chinese hacking of American corporations for commercial advantages. According to the Obama administration, the former is fair game; the latter is illegal.With the revelations of Edward Snowden, Beijing has fittingly dismissed the nuanced American distinction between espionage for national security and China's commercial cyber attacks to obtain intellectual properties and trade secrets for the benefits of SOEs. Snowden revealed that the NSA has infiltrated into Huawei Technologies, a high-tech Chinese multinational company. A recent Foreign Policy article confirmed that an elite NSA ultra-secret China hacking group ""successfully penetrated"" Chinese computers and its telecommunication industry for the past 15 years. Consequently, China swiftly condemned the American charges against the PLA operatives. Beijing retaliated to these indictments by prematurely canceling the recently initiated cyber-security dialogue, which was just beginning to build mutual confidence and trust. Diminishing American moral authority inflicts further damage on the formerly improving Sino-American relationship. For example, when U.S. Senator Ron Wyden accused Director of National Intelligence James Clapper of complicity in an ongoing ""culture of misinformation,"" America's international credibility was undermined. These incidents impede the emerging spirit of military-to-military cooperation.The Powerless AmericaIn all this, the public display by the Justice Department is widely perceived as a sign of American weakness by the Chinese. For them, it was a classic public relations maneuver of an unpopular Obama in the mid-term elections. President Barack Obama's rhetoric and conflicting messages to his allies and friends in the East and South China Seas are viewed as ambiguous and misguided. Beijing likely interprets this as a twisted kind of ""speak softly, and carry a big stick"" diplomacy that was championed by President Theodore Roosevelt; Obama speaks eloquently of cooperation but nevertheless deploys military forces to disputed maritime regions.At the same time, China has quietly applied American foreign policies and doctrines to its own advantage. Despite Beijing's proclaimed ""peaceful rise,"" a newly powerful China is taking lessons from President Ronald Reagan's ""Peace through Strength"" strategy in the East and South China Seas. China's assertive behavior in these contested territorial waters can be regarded as Beijing's own Monroe Doctrine.Economic reformer Deng Xiaoping advised to his posterity to ""patiently wait for our time, build our own abilities"" to regain power. President Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream -- an extension of the American Dream with Chinese characteristics -- is a brilliant stratagem to both galvanize the growing Chinese middle-class and reassure the U.S. audience of Beijing's new American-sounding vision.Beijing consistently demands that U.S. should be an equal partner and firmly engages in ""Peaceful War"" to gain ""respect"" for ""win-win"" cooperation. When Xi introduced his concept of ""new type of major country relations,"" the Communist Party leader may not have imagined acting in a global public square with accusations and counter-accusations. Yet, China has quickly adapted to Obama's rhetoric and noises about freedom. Beijing responded quickly and effectively to the U.S. indictment, knowing that PLA officials would never face American justice.The higgledy-piggledy distinction between national security and corporate interests is hardly convincing to the Chinese, especially when the U.S. revolving doors conveniently inhabit the space between government service and corporations during both Democratic and Republican administrations. Just like the Sino-American relations in commercial intercourse, economics triumphs over ideology in the partisan world of American politics.On China's side, its intertwined national and economic interests are enshrined in the peculiar institution of the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). This is a very different animal than the private corporations in the United States.Survival StrategiesIn a rapidly changing world, a firm foundation of Confucian traditions and historic laurels has permitted the world's oldest and continuous civilization to evolve and remain resilient. Sino-Russian energy and political ties, for example, underscore perceptions of declining American geostrategic power in Eurasia, the Middle East, and the Eastern Europe. The growing U.S. national debt and shrinking economic resources due in part to the sequestration and the Budget Control Act contributes to the perception of declining American might in parallel with a diminished moral authority and prestige after more than a decade of costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.This perception of declining American power is, however, misplaced. The U.S. armed forces have the power to deploy its expeditionary forces to every corner of the world within a 24-hour period. Neither China nor Russia desires to have or even has the will to boast the power to project this kind of global force -- at least in the near future. The so-called indispensable nation now has drones and stealth weapons watching over every action of all nations and their leaders.Does this omnipotent power really matter? President Obama said that ""I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States"" but he admitted that his determination to use the levers of American power (referring to Crimea, Nigeria, Syria and elsewhere) is limited. However, the mere existence of that power as a presidential choice is itself deterrence.In the end, neither the superior capabilities of one nation nor another nation's glorious past matters. What matters is a shared future. Surely there will be human conflicts, political disagreements, and military miscalculations. But by making this distinction between national security and corporate espionage to China, the Obama administration sent a tortuous message to the world."

You've heard it a thousand times. But why? What reason could there possibly be that we or God (or whomever you believe in) created loss? Is it possible there could be MORE to the passing of a loved one than we previously considered?This is my interpretation and expansion of a conversation between Oprah and Babyface (who had just lost his mother in 2013), a conversation that joyously changed the way I look at death, life and what's possible.When someone dies who really loves you; a parent, a child, a spouse, a friend -- you can actually become happier. If you allow it, you can be uplifted with the passing of the one you love, becoming even more joyous, successful and intimate. You can resonate higher and happier -- even happier than you were when with your loved one on this physical plane. The grief that comes with loss does not have to take you down.Why? Because the love of your dearly departed is now with you constantly and in a different and sometimes richer way, their spirit more available to you. Using Babyface as the example, he was extremely close to his mother when she was alive, but now has an even more profound and close relationship with her since she passed. A better (albeit different) relationship than he had with her before. He doesn't have to fill her in on the details of his life or explain how he's feeling -- his mom already knows. She's with him in every moment he wants her to be, can sense how he's feeling without needing explanation or description of emotion or the situation. Babyface connects with her daily and swears they are closer now than ever. Their bond is actually more -- more loving, more intimate and more (dare I say) telepathic?So whether it's the loss of the one who birthed you or a dear friend, with that death comes the potential for a monumental infusion of positive energy. If you allow it, with that loss comes a chance for real and positive change. After grieving, these infusions can actually build you up. Your life can blossom. You become stronger because you're literally infused with the spirit of your loved one and the two energies -- yours and theirs -- blend together in synergy to create a more empowered, joyous you. It's now 1+1 =3. This is only possible because your loved one is no longer physical.This is the one gem of light in the otherwise torturous loss of a loved one. Being conscious of this gift, allowing it and remembering it (for yourself and others) could be life changing during grieving, so spread the word.Blogger's Note: THIS is what you write about in a condolence card."

The nearly five-year effort to free the only American soldier held captive in Afghanistan is scattered among numerous federal agencies with a loosely organized group of people working on it mostly part time, according to two members of Congress and military officials involved in the effort. An ever-shrinking U.S. military presence in Afghanistan has re-focused attention on efforts to bring home Bergdahl, who has been held by the Taliban since June 30, 2009.

Bowe Bergdahl, there are no American POWs. As we discuss the release of Bergdahl, it is important to recognize what his rare captivity demonstrates about America's new way of war. His captivity shares some similarities with past conflicts. Like many prisoners in Korea and Vietnam, Bergdahl was held for a long time, in his case five years. During this time he likely experienced extreme isolation, mental and physical abuse, and manipulative efforts to convert him into a Taliban supporter. While he was held, his family and friends were uncertain and fearful about his status, his whereabouts and whether he would ever come home. In many ways, however, Bergdahl's experience was different from past conflicts. His extreme isolation from those who shared his citizenship, language, and culture reveals the almost total lack of American POWs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bergdahl wasn't just a POW; he was the POW, the only American being held in Afghanistan by the Taliban. Those involved in national security and the military all knew his name and his status. People in Afghanistan at the time when Bergdahl was taken said that his capture led to the war's temporary shutdown as everyone focused on locating and rescuing him. This dramatic focus on one POW reveals the high level of sensitivity to American casualties in the Afghanistan conflict and the fear about what the Taliban would do with captives. MIA and POW figures in the low single digits, compared with almost 8,000 in the Korean War, also demonstrate a historic change in America's ability to rapidly locate and rescue missing military personnel. Look at differences along three dimensions: theater, enemy and technology. The Vietnam jungle made it easy to ambush U.S. forces, and for individual soldiers to become isolated from their units. In comparison, Afghanistan's desert terrain, even when mountainous, makes keeping track of American forces easier and greatly facilitates the employment of dominant U.S. air power. The enemy in Vietnam saw more political advantage in prisoners than the enemy in Afghanistan. The Taliban are not as strong an insurgent force as previous adversaries. In Afghanistan the U.S. almost always has asymmetrical mass -- the tactical advantage in a fight, which was not the case in Vietnam or Korea. Contributing to that asymmetry, new technology has fundamentally altered the information space, creating huge advantages for U.S. forces. GPS technology allows American ground troops to accurately determine their location, which, when coupled with precision-guided munitions and other smart weapons, contributes to quick, accurate and directed support. Drones, which can linger and search over the battlefield, provide fantastic battlefield intelligence. Satellite/UHF and computer technology provide rapid and wide coverage, stretching the tactical battlefield so that units always remain connected and aware of each other. Individual emergency beacons facilitate soldiers' swift rescue and retrieval. When combined, these factors generate historically low levels of MIA and POW figures, dramatically changing the way these wars are fought.The nature of war continually evolves as adversaries adapt, win and lose. The current way of war, especially insurgent and counterinsurgent conflict, contains random death and injury from IEDs and snipers, a frustrating inability to measure progress, and a revolutionary tactical change in the likelihood that soldiers will be taken and held prisoner. Sgt. Bergdahl's release, and with it the complete absence of American POWs in Afghanistan, make clear the fundamental transformation in the American way of war."
