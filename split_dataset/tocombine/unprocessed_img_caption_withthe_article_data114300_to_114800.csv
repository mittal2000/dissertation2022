A top Obama administration official says no one, not even children trying to escape violent countries, can illegally enter the United States without eventually facing deportation proceedings. But Homeland Security Sec Jeh Johnson basically acknowledged Sunday that such proceedings might be long delayed, and he said that coping with floods of unaccompanied minors crossing the border is a legal and humanitarian dilemma for the US.

She was clubbed over the head and dragged off by two men who cut a hole in her throat, stuffed her panties in it, and left her body in a ravine across the street from Cristian's house.""In the case of Andrea, she was 13 years old when she was raped and forced into prostitution by the drug cartels in Honduras. Two years later, she managed to escape and fled to the United States for the United States two years and is now seeking humanitarian relief.Cristian and Andrea are just two of the thousands of children in Central America who are fleeing their Central American homes and neighborhoods from such extreme violence. In fact, Honduras' homicide rate of 90.4 per 100,000 is the highest in the world - by a wide margin. The prevalence of drug cartels and gang violence and penetration in the country puts its murder rate at almost double the next most dangerous countries in the world, which include Guatemala and El Salvador.In response, some of our political leaders have said they simply cannot imagine sending their children on an extremely dangerous journey to the United States and question the choices these families and children are making to come here. But, that is precisely the point. Politicians cannot imagine it because these children are fleeing violence, rape, and fear that are unfathomable to us. These children are not leaving their home countries to make a perilous journey across hostile territory to the United States simply in search of a better job. They are children. And, as Sonia Navario says, many of them are ""fleeing for their lives.""Compounding the Crisis and Making Things Far WorseCurrent law is that children from Central America are afforded protections in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to screen them for the possibility of refugee or parolee status.Although members of Congress and the president are professing to pursue a humanitarian response to the border crisis, the proposed solutions often undercut the very protections that children have in current law in order to have the Border Patrol expedite their deportation back to Central America.Proposals put forth by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are one example of this. He has acknowledged that a number of these children have been subjected to forms of torture, mutilation, and threats of death by these drug cartels. On Fox News, Cruz said:Horrifically, they're cutting off body parts, and they're sending it back to the families. And they're forcing little boys and little girls, they're putting a gun to the back of their head, and they're saying cut off the finger, cut off the ear of another child. And if the child refuses, they're shooting and killing that kid.This is horrific, and yet strangely, his solution is to mass deport all of these children back into the hands of the Central American drug lords. This caused Fox News host Chris Wallace to call out Cruz on his nonsensical solution. ""You keep talking about helping the kids,"" said Wallace. ""One question I have is, how do you help the kids...to just say, 'Hey, you've got to stay in Central America.' You talk about the violence in Central America, the murder rate in some of these countries....but [your proposal] doesn't help the kids.""Raices, a legal services organization in San Antonio, has conducted in-depth screenings of more than 3,000 Central American youth this year in Texas shelters and has found at least half of them could present viable claims for humanitarian relief. Consequently, their executive director, Jonathan Ryan, opposes the push to have the Border Patrol more rapidly screen and deport these children. ""Many children would be sent back to harm. We would have their names here, and the morgue in Tegucigalpa will have the bodies down there,"" he said, referring to the capital of Honduras.Other experts and Border Patrol agents themselves agree that they should not have the responsibility for adjudicating the response to every individual migrant child. As Dara Lind at Vox writes:Agents say that Border Patrol's job isn't to deal with immigrant children, but rather to catch criminals crossing the border. Advocates, meanwhile, believe that screening traumatized children who've just come over the border is very difficult, and something that should be done by child welfare experts, not by Border Patrol agents.Navario, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who has investigated this issue for well over a decade, added her voice in opposition to expedited screening and removal of these children when she testified before Congress. As she explained, ""...if you shortchange the due process that these children have in immigration courts where they can claim asylum, they really are, in 40 to 60% of these cases of these children, refugees fleeing for their lives. And you should not shortchange this process.""She adds:...if you put this decision of sending these children back in the hands of the Border Patrol, many of these children who really should be protected by our government will instead be hurtled back to these countries where they will die. And we will have blood on our hands.The Best Interest of the ChildIn the name of helping children, our nation should not take actions that would impose more harm upon children. As such, the president, Congress, and policymakers at the state and local level should adopt a ""best interest of the child"" standard when addressing the needs of children.This is a fundamental principle for policy-making involving children. For example, although some process to be concerned about the flight of children, their proposed solutions would often do the opposite. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert both expertly mocked and satirized the false compassion and fallacy of logic of those that profess to care deeply about ""the children"" and yet put forth proposals that would deny them their due process rights and immediately deport them back to the terror and danger they fled.For example, in the face of this children's crisis, Senator Cruz has not only proposed to immediately deport children back to Central America, but he has also proposed to go beyond this humanitarian situation and to create further upheaval by arguing for the deportation of DREAMers as well. In either case, these would not be acts that would be detrimental and not in the best interest of children. But, as Senator Cruz explained his tactics to Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker, he works hard to flip the frame and change the focus in political discussions. As Cruz says, ""In both law and politics, I think the essential battle is the meta-battle of framing the narrative. As Sun Tzu said, Every battle is won before it's fought. It's won by choosing the terrain on which it will be fought.""Therefore, a humanitarian crisis that should focus on addressing the needs and interests of children is being flipped on its head by some in order to place political blame on the president, block both immigration reform and the DREAM Act, and push an agenda to build more walls and barriers, further militarize the border, separate more families, and sent kids into harm's way. Without any doubt, rather than addressing the needs and best interest of children, this is an agenda that would be harmful to kids.America is better than that and the angry, racist, xenophobic protesters in Murrieta, California, that yelled, chanted, and cursed at traumatized children. Or, as in Oracle, Arizona, where an angry mob, including Congressional Candidate Adam Kwasman, yelled at a school bus filled that they thought were migrant children but were instead YMCA campers, who as columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr., says, were ""giggling and using their cellphones to take pictures of the demonstrators and the media horde.""But, while it is somewhat funny that these adults made fools of themselves, Pitts points out:You're still left with the reality that a bunch of adults -- one a candidate for Congress -- thought it a good idea to interdict a bunch of children who had just survived a long and terrifying journey from Central America, arrived alone in a strange land and been taken into custody -- and yell at them to go back 'to Mexico.' In English.America as a Beacon of Hope, Compassion, and FreedomFortunately, there are growing voices of reason and compassion who are demanding solutions with a focus on the best interests of the children. For example, Lupillo Rivera stopped at the Murrieta rally and brought a voice of reason to the situation as he said, ""It doesn't matter where a child is from. He deserves respect and help because he's a child.""This is also much of our history that should be instructive. In fact, the very first immigrant to arrive at the immigration station at Ellis Island was Annie Moore, a 15 year-old unaccompanied child from Ireland, on January 1, 1892. According to Barry Moreno, a librarian at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the Immigration Act of 1907 set up a system in which unaccompanied children, including orphans, were allowed hearings whereby ""local missionaries, synagogues, immigrant aid societies, and private citizens would often step in and offer to take guardianship of the child.""Many of these children became very successful contributors to the growth of America. As Tasneem Raja of Mother Jones writes, ""And of course, many of those kids grew up to work tough jobs, start new businesses and create new jobs, and pass significant amounts of wealth down to some of the very folks clamoring to 'send 'em back' today.""Also, between 1960 and 1962, the American government went out of its way to help Cuban children come to the United States through a program known as Operation Pedro Pan. This initiative, supported by the Department of State, which granted the visa waivers, the CIA in Cuba, and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in the U.S., and through the support of Father Bryan O. Walsh and the Catholic Welfare Bureau, airlifted more than 14,000 Cuban children out of Havana to the United States whose parents did not want them to live under the rule of Fidel Castro. As the Miami Herald described it, ""Parents of all religious creeds...put their trust in the secret program started by Catholic Charities that brought 14,048 children to the United States in less than two years before it had to shut down in October 1962. It was parents' most painful sacrifice -- to be separated from their kids to save them....""Oscar Pichardo, who came to this country from Cuba when he was 10 years old, says, ""You had to live the stark reality that our parents faced and led them to make the hard decisions born out of love and courage to protect their children. When it came time to decide to either submit to the state or send the children to safety, Cuban parents chose freedom for their children -- sending them unaccompanied to the United States.""And, earlier this year, conservatives across the country championed the asylum case of the Romeike family, who argued that Germany would not allow the family to homeschool their six children. Congressman Phil Roe of Tennessee argued that ""civil disobedience"" might be necessary to prevent deportation. After lengthy review (rather than rapid deportation), the U.S. Government granted asylum to the Romeike family.So, just as the U.S. granted relief to the children in these other cases in the past, simple fairness would dictate that the government should, at the very least, carefully consider the claims of the children of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador as well. In fact, unlike the Romeike case, the actual lives of Central American refugee children are at stake.The Moral Case for Protecting ChildrenCatholic Bishop Mark Sietz testified before the House Judiciary Committee last month and explained that:...the protection of migrant children is an especially important issue for the Catholic Church, as one of Jesus' first experiences as an infant was to flee for his life from King Herod with his family to Egypt. Indeed, Jesus himself was a child migrant fleeing violence. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were asylum-seekers and faced the same choice as the one facing thousands of children fleeing to the United States each year.He adds:...the Catholic Church's work in assisting unaccompanied migrant children stems from the belief that every person has a unique and sacred dignity. This dignity is not bestowed by governments or by laws or based upon the wealth or where they happen to be born. It inheres within the human being.Seitz also urged the Committee to recognize and take particular notice of the fact that the children fleeing Central America are vulnerable victims and not some sort of threat, as some, including Texas Governor Rick Perry are making them out to be by sending the National Guard to the border. They aren't.As Seitz says, ""Too often, and especially recently in the media, these children are being looked at with distrust and as capable adult actors, instead of as vulnerable and frightened children who have been introduced to the injustice and horror of the world at an early age. Anyone who hears the stories of these children would be moved, as they are victims fleeing violence and terror, not perpetrators.""In an interview with the Christian Post, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, adds:These are people created in the image of God. It's easy to forget when we're simply talking about the issue as though it were merely political. Americans, regardless of our views on immigration policy, ought to be moved with compassion for the plight of these children; and to ask: 'What should we do to address this crisis?' And see the crisis for what it is - a moral issue and not merely a political one.In light of that perspective, the Southern Baptist Convention wrote a letter urging Congress ""not to weaken our trafficking laws that were part of President Bush's strong efforts to combat human trafficking."" The letter reads, ""The last thing we should do is to empower even more trafficking in response to this problem.""Consequently, rather than sending in the National Guard, rolling back child trafficking safeguards, or forcing mass deportations of children back to the dangerous circumstances they are fleeing, First Focus and a number of other organizations, including Bishop Sietz's Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, recommend that the president and Congress focus on and adopt the best interest of the child standard in moving forward. As Seitz testified:For the children, the faithful adherence to the best interest of the child standard is necessary in all decision-making. The best interest of the child principle is an internationally recognized child-welfare standard used in the U.S. child welfare system. It refers to a process of determining services, care arrangements, caregivers, and placements best suited to meet a child's short-term and long-term needs and ensure safety permanency, and well-being. When applied in the United States, special importance is given to family integrity, health, safety, protection of the child, and timely placement. They are just children, after all.For more policy recommendations on how best to address this humanitarian crisis, see Bishop Sietz's full testimony here , an op-ed by Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, here, and a full set of additional resources from First Focus's Center for the Children of Immigrants here."
1,BUSINESS,Women And Minorities Are Punished For Promoting Women And Minorities At Work: Study,Jillian Berman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diversity-study_n_5620839.html,,2014-07-28,"FILE - This Feb. 20, 2013 file image released by NBC shows Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer appearing on NBC News' ""Today"" show, in New York to introduce the website's redesign. As Mayer goes about her CEO business of saving Yahoo, which now involves a ban on working from home, a new study shows a significant jump in the number of U.S. employers offering flex and other quality-of-life perks. (AP Photo/NBC, Peter Kramer, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb311262100000001c7af5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Valuing diversity is apparently frowned upon in Corporate America -- unless you’re a white man.Women and minorities who promote diversity from corporate leadership positions tend to get lower evaluations from their bosses and colleagues, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Colorado and University of Texas.The study was based on two experiments. In the first, researchers studied the performance evaluations of 362 high-level executives. The evaluations were given by bosses and peers to execs in a leadership-training program. Women and minorities who got high marks for valuing diversity -- like understanding different cultural backgrounds and managing workers with different backgrounds effectively -- got lower scores in their reviews than women and minority colleagues who didn’t appear to value diversity as much.White men didn’t appear to suffer in their performance ratings for valuing diversity. But that experiment didn't prove that valuing diversity hurt performance scores. So the team did another experiment. In this one, 395 students watched trained actors playing human-resources professionals pitching to hire certain candidates. Some pushed for the non-white-male candidates and emphasized diversity in their pitch. Others advocated for the white male candidates. The students watching the presentations reacted negatively when women and minority actors pushed for diverse candidates. Women in the audience winced when they saw women pushing for another woman to get the job for the sake of diversity, according to David Hekman, the lead author of the study and a management professor at the University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business. “They were like, ‘This is terrible, you’re hurting all of us, it makes us all look like we’re incompetent and weak, like we can’t do this ourselves,’” Hekman said. Students reacted pretty positively to pitches for hiring white men, Hekman said -- particularly when women and non-white actors were the ones doing the pitching. Such reactions may arise from negative stereotypes about women and minorities, the researchers suggested. Women and minorities promoting each other fits into the misguided idea that they are more likely to indulge in selfish favoritism than promote deserving candidates.Hekman pointed to the divergent fortunes of Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer and recently-axed New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson as a possible example of how his findings play out in the real world. Mayer has publicly distanced herself from feminism. Like most tech giants, Yahoo is somewhat lacking when it comes to diversity: Just 23 percent of its senior managers are women, and women make up 37 percent of its total work force. Black and Hispanic employees account for just 6 percent of Yahoo’s work force. Abramson, on the other hand, has repeatedly called filling half of the Times' leadership roles with women one of her greatest accomplishments. “Marissa Mayer is worth $300 million bucks, and Jill Abramson is fired,” Hekman said. That may be oversimplifying things: The Times, after all, replaced Abramson with a black man, Dean Baquet. But the study suggests that women and minorities who reach the top gain more personally from being a token than from helping others get ahead. Boosting diversity in the upper corporate ranks could require essentially reframing the issue, according to Hekman. Instead of emphasizing diversity, he suggests companies push leaders to be “demographically unselfish"" -- in other words, aim to hire and promote people that are unlike themselves.“'Diversity' is a loaded term,” Hekman said. “It’s used as a euphemism for 'You like to promote non-whites and women.'”Hekman and his team also propose putting white men in charge of promoting diversity at companies. Many companies have established ""chief diversity officer"" roles, but keep filling those jobs with women and minorities, which only reinforces the negative stereotypes about them. Sixty percent of companies in the Fortune 500 have CDOs, and 65 percent of the people holding those jobs are women, and 37 percent are African-American, according to a 2012 Wall Street Journal report. “Almost all of diversity offices are run by non-whites and women, but I think that further ghettoizes diversity itself and makes it so it’s not taken seriously,” Hekman said. “Nobody can attack a white man for being selfish if he’s promoting diversity.” "
2,HEALTHY LIVING,Miss Idaho Sierra Sandison Shows Us Her Insulin Pump,"Scott Benner, ContributorStay-at-home dad and author, Life Is Short, Laundry Is Ete...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-idaho-sierra-sandiso_b_5620049.html,A few weeks ago Sierra Sandison was a contestant in the Miss Idaho Pageant. She wasn't a diabetes advocate or even a person who widely shared with her friends that she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 18. Much has changed since then.,2014-07-28,2014-07-25-10505148_10152569081188529_9010539351191568544_o.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-25-10505148_10152569081188529_9010539351191568544_o-thumb.jpg,"A few weeks ago Sierra Sandison was a contestant in the Miss Idaho Pageant. She wasn't a diabetes advocate or even a person who widely shared with her friends that she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 18. Much has changed since then. Sierra was backstage at Miss Idaho during the first night of competition when she had a chance meeting with Miss Idaho's Outstanding Preteen, 12-year-old McCall Salinas. Sierra stepped out of her dressing room and heard these words: ""Oh my gosh, is that an insulin pump?""Sierra told me that her stomach ""flip flopped"" when she realized that McCall recognized her insulin pump for what it was. I thought, ""Oh no, people are going to notice, I was hoping that it was little enough that no one would notice.""Sierra's second reaction to McCall's words, ""I got scared,"" but then McCall quickly explained that she also had Type 1 diabetes and that she didn't use an insulin pump because ""she was scared of what her friends would think and of how it would look.""It was during this brief encounter that a diabetes advocate was born. Sierra Sandison, a 20-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes only two years prior, was about to make a decision that would change her life. She could disconnect from her pump when she took the stage in her swim suit or leave it on and help McCall to not feel quite so alone.At the time that their exchange took place Sierra told me, ""I had no idea that I would even make the top 10, let alone become Miss Idaho -- but I thought, I have to do this for McCall.""During the interview I mentioned to Sierra that I believe people become advocates when they realize that they care more for another person than they do for themselves. This was that moment for Sierra. When she left that conversation with McCall she was a different person, and that person didn't want McCall to be worried about what other people would think.It only took Sierra a second to decide that she was going to walk on stage wearing her insulin pump, ""I have to do this for McCall,"" she thought.""It was really scary (to walk out on stage) but thinking about McCall gave me a whole new confidence."" Suddenly Sierra didn't care what the audience or the judges thought and the prospect of becoming Miss Idaho or Miss America became secondary.When she came off stage McCall walked up to Sierra and said, ""now I want to get a pump."" Sierra and McCallSierra ""balled her eyes out"" when she realized that something she had done helped another person to find the confidence to be him or herself.If this story stopped here it would be amazing and completely worth sharing. It's a story of two strangers who find each other by chance, both unaware of how much they are in need of the other's support. A simple and beautiful story of humanity, empathy and the power of sameness. But social media had other plans for this moment and later when Sierra shared a photo of herself and McCall on Facebook, along with a brief description of how they met backstage and the events that transpired immediately after, Sierra found a community of loving people living with diabetes that she didn't know existed -- and they had her back.The outpouring of support that she received on Facebook prompted Sierra to share a different photo, this time of her walking on stage in her black bikini with her insulin pump on her side. This is the first time that she would use the hashtag #ShowMeYourPump.  (Photo via Susan Hessing Photography)In an instant 20-year-old Sierra Sandison went from being a hopeful pageant contestant who got caught up in the desire to support a little girl, to the face of confidence and security for people everywhere who live with insulin dependent diabetes. Her image was about to inspire countless thousands to share pictures of themselves with their insulin pumps on social media. Sierra's very unintended coming out party was suddenly and gleefully part of the ethos. Now everywhere you look on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+ and the rest of social media, people with diabetes are showing their pumps to the world in an effort to become invisible. The chain of events is continuing on. Sierra's decision to support McCall has become a phenomenon of strangers holding up their pumps in support of Sierra, and in support of themselves. We are witnessing humanity at it's best, we are witnessing people whose desire to support a stranger is helping them to overcome the same insecurity that brought Sierra and McCall together. All any of us want is to be anonymous and in a world where different is often looked upon with fear, the people who want, need and deserve that anonymity sometimes have to stand front and center to get it.Show them your pump, until no one sees it.Today, because a little girl noticed an insulin pump on a stranger's hip, people who live with diabetes are a lot closer to that goal. I told Sierra that my hope is that one day soon another girl will walk onto a stage wearing an insulin pump, and that no one will notice. No one will post a picture, ask for an interview or bat an eye. That's the world I want to live in, it's the world McCall needs and the world that Sierra Sandison's bravery brought us all one-step closer to... when she showed us her pump.#ShowMeYourPumpThis story originally appeared on Scott Benner's Type 1 diabetes parenting blog, Arden's Day."

Even cooler -- Meghan can whip your butt at laser tag. Yeah, she can.You're the female lead in the CW's new show Backpackers which was picked up by the CW's online web-series platform, CW Seed. What's the difference between shooting for television vs. an online web-series?I actually couldn't tell the difference with Backpackers. I really felt as if we were shooting for television. I think that made the transition over to TV an easy one.You will be appearing alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Adam Driver in the August release film called What If. Give us a behind the scenes story.I had the best time shooting What If. Anytime I was on set with Dan there would be Harry Potter fans waiting for a chance to meet him. He was very gracious and lovely to them. It was nice to see. Who taught you how to pose at press events?I still feel incredibly awkward posing on red carpets. I think it's something that will always be somewhat uncomfortable. I can only hope that it will get easier with time.What clothing and shoes do you feel most comfortable in?My personal style is a little all over the place. I love girly dresses as much as I love my yoga jeans and Converse. I think it's really important to make sustainable fashion choices. The majority of my wardrobe consists of Canadian and American brands that have been made in North America. Danier, Second Denim, Teeki, Podolls and Stuart and Brown are some favorites.Tell us the story about your rescue dog, Lola, and the children's book you're writing about her journey.I met Lola in a little town called Gigante, Nicaragua. She lived at a taco stand/hostel on the beach. It was incredibly easy to fall in love with her. She was sweet and loving and followed me around for about two weeks. I didn't think it would be possible to bring her back, but with the help of a fellow Canadian dog lover she was on a plane to Canada a few weeks later. It definitely wasn't easy on either of us, but it was worth it. She is such a special dog, with a funny face and an amazing story. It seemed natural to write about it.Aren't you bored of Disneyland by now?I don't think I could ever be bored of Disneyland. It's such a magical place with so much history. I love bringing friends and family who have never been. Seeing people's inner child is something amazing. Also Mickey Mouse is everything. Favorite place to get nachos.My kitchen. I love to create my own nacho masterpieces. It's all in the salsa and cheese distribution. Why did you choose the vegetarian lifestyle?I've been vegetarian for about three years now. I lived close to a slaughter house in Toronto, so that pretty much sealed the deal.Tell us about your audition for Lost Girl.I was actually sick during my Lost Girl audition, but lucky for me Ron Murphy (the director) was familiar with my work and booked me. It was a very sickly audition, so thank you Ron.What are you infatuated with?At this moment I'm infatuated with the band We are Twin. They only have five songs, and I love every single one. Also coffee. Coffee is a new infatuation. What's the best part about being a Libra?Being born in October!

I'm not saying Thor and Superman don't exist. I believe they do. But not the way the media has set our expectations. Your Thor could be a loving accountant. You find him attractive, in good health and he's looking for a long term commitment. He may not have a six pack, but he's fit and health conscious. He's not Mr. Sensitive, but he's loving, he listens and cares deeply about you. He's a good father and a strong man. He doesn't have a mansion, but his modest home is well-maintained and his Toyota Camry is safe and clean. That's a ""super"" man. That's a modern-day real Thor. Not a god from Asgard, but a man from Earth. Is it possible that we have all been duped by Disney, Reality TV and matchmaking shows that prey on our fanciful thinking about love and relationships? Do we somehow consciously and unconsciously long for this unrealistic version of Mr. Right -- sorry ""Mr. Perfect"" -- with the body of Thor, the manners of Superman, Prince Charming's castle and Donald Trump's cash? Yeah... I'm pretty sure that's the case for many of us, even when we swear it's not.And, quite frankly, it's damn hard not to! We've been fed this idealistic fantasy since we could hold a book. Nowadays, we don't have to do anything more than click a button on our iPads to hear and see Cinderella win the day and the man -- oops, sorry, ""The Prince"" -- all by just wishing, hoping, waiting... and possibly doing a little house cleaning.Wondering if you are a damsel in distress wishing, hoping or waiting for your prince, your Thor? Here are a few signs that might indicate you are waiting for a superhero:  1. You notice his flaws before you notice what he's got going for him. Before he even asks you out, you have a list of what's wrong. He wears sandals or doesn't wear suits; he uses too much cologne; he has a kid; he doesn't have a kid; he doesn't have a house; his house is a dump; his job is menial; his job is too demanding; he's too nice; he's not nice enough; he's too sensitive; he's not sensitive enough. Sheesh -- cut a guy a break! No man is perfect. And let's face it -- neither are we.  2. You want a mind reader.   This is a superpower. And no human has that power. A few come close, but on the whole, very few men are going to know what you want, when you want it and how you want it. My grandmother used to say, ""You must summer and winter, and summer and winter, with a man to truly know him,"" and for him to truly know you. Give a man the chance to know you and then leave some space for him to please you. The right man will be paying attention.  3. You want a superhero because all your last boyfriends were super villains (or worse, super losers) and you aren't going through that again! You are using him to make up for past relationships. ""He"" has to be perfect because all of your past beaus were duds. That's not his fault. It's not even the male species fault. You are 100% empowered to end any relationship at any time. Especially one's that you feel aren't healthy or just the wrong fit. I'm not saying it's easy, I'm saying it can be done. And the ugly truth -- no matter how perfect he is, it won't make up for all the damage done by those previous ""losers."" You need to do your work and get support to deal with your issues surrounding your choices in men. Don't make him pay for something he had nothing to do with.   4. You don't have it all, but if you put his stuff with your stuff, then you both would have it all together. Wrong! My unresolved issues plus your unresolved issues equals breakup.  Equation: 1//2 + 1/2 = 0 This is a tough one. Many of us don't want to admit this is true. But I see a lot of women (and men) who really are looking for someone to ""complete"" instead of ""compliment them. This never works out. Only you can address the areas of struggle in your life. Just like you can't fix him, he can't fix you. Remember two wrongs don't make a right; they make a mess.  5. Thor, a.k.a. Perfect Man, means I won't get hurt.  ....And the closer he is to perfection the less chance you'll be hurt. Relationships are messy and no one is perfect. Even Thor has his issues. He loves a woman from another universe, his father wants him to be king and he doesn't, his brother is in prison for treason,and he's never home because he's saving the world. Sounds like some of the guys you've dated, right? You won't be happy or complete in any relationship. You'll be partnered with someone who will share your ups, downs and in-between life moments; someone who will witness your life. Having the perfect man won't perfect you or your life.   A man who is ""all in"" can't give you ""all things. He can't be everything you are to and for yourself. Then he wouldn't be himself.   Many women want a superhero because deep down in places they don't talk about at parties (thank you, Colonel Jessup, for that line) they aren't satisfied. They may ""have it all,"" but it feels empty, because what they truly want is a partner to ""share it all"" with. They want to share their careers, their homes, their beds and their hearts with a man, a true partner. They want the feelings that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gives Jane (Natalie Portman) in the movie; the feeling of being loved, protected, wanted, valued and respected for who they are. I get that. I want that too.  What I am hoping is that we come to realize that there are plenty of Thors in our own Universe. We don't have to travel to Asgard or even Alaska to find the perfect mate. Our superhero doesn't have to have superpowers or a perfect backstory and family tree; he doesn't have to have the perfect resume or the perfect bod. In fact, he doesn't have to be perfect, period. What I really want (what I think we all want) is a man who is the perfect complement to who we are as people; a man who's into partnership, not perfection. There are real men, relationship-minded men right under your nose. And they are waiting to put on their capes for the woman who sees him as her man, her lover, her partner, her superhero, her Thor. Don't keep him or you waiting by watching the skies, waiting for the myth to materialize."

The school, one of dozens of emergency shelters for those who have fled the fighting. It's the morning of Eid al-Fitr, the three-day holiday that caps the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. In normal times, the men would have worshipped at their neighborhood mosques. However, 20 mosques have been hit by Israeli warplanes so far, according to Palestinian officials. Israel says Hamas stores weapons and rockets in houses of worship. The men prefer to perform Eid prayers in the relative safety of the school.

Eid is usually a time of celebration — three days of celebration, to be exact.But this year, the holiday mood in the Palestinian territories is distinctly less joyous and it shows in the Dawod’s buffet. The spread included roasted lamb, “maamoul,” a sweet flaky dessert filled with honey and nuts, and “fawakih,” a fruit platter with grapes, apples, and mangos.“We usually have more food,” said Dawod, 21, “and more music and games, but because of what’s happening in Gaza we have less.”This year, the television in the background brings news from Gaza — most recently, of the death of at least eight children as a result of the bombing of Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital.“This Eid is not Eid because of the situation in Gaza,” said Maher Abu Mayaleh, a shopkeeper in the Arab “souk,” or bazaar, in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City. “We are not happy. We do not want to celebrate anything. Our people are dying.”Eid is traditionally a time when people shop for new clothes, and buy the best meats, sweets, and vegetables for their holiday meals. Families travel to see uncles, cousins, and siblings.But this year, instead of sweets, people are drinking black coffee without sugar, a sign of mourning in Palestinian culture. Instead of new clothes, people are sending their alms to Gaza. Instead of going on vacation, people stay home, glued to the TV set.Family is important during Eid and the somber mood affects children and teens alike.Hamed Hamam’s 7-year-old son, Abed Alkareem, said he is excited to see his family from Ramallah and looks forward to playing with his cousins. But in solidarity with the people of Gaza, the boy said he didn’t want presents or new toys this year.“Give them to Gaza,” said the boy who lives in Ramallah, a Palestinian city in the West Bank.Others are trying their best to lend a hand, or an arm.“I gave blood yesterday to go help the people on Gaza,” said Ahmed Imam, a 16-year-old resident of East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. “That’s what I did in honor of Eid. It is how I celebrate this year — helping my brothers.”Surrounded by her female cousins, Dawod said there’s a point “where I even feel guilty when I laugh. My brothers and sisters are suffering.”But there is still hope for peace and tranquility, she said.“I saw pictures this morning of people making the cookies, the maamoul, in Gaza and I thought: Wow these people are strong. They gave me hope.” "

The U.S. says millions of people were forced from their homes because of their religious beliefs last year. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ecc8240000510098aba2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) And then there were nine. Secretary of State John Kerry announced on Monday (July 28) that Turkmenistan has joined the State Department’s list of worst religious freedom offenders.The State Department’s “Countries of Particular Concern” list had remained static since 2006, when eight countries — Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Uzbekistan — were designated as CPCs.Justifying the addition of Turkmenistan, Kerry cited reports of people detained, beaten and tortured for their beliefs, prohibited from wearing religious attire and fined for distributing religious materials.Turkmenistan, a mostly Sunni Muslim country in Central Asia, once part of the Soviet Union, forbids private worship and greatly restricts foreign travel for pilgrimages and religious education.All religious organizations in the country must register with the government, and Shiite Muslim groups, Protestant groups and Jehovah’s Witnesses have all had their registration applications denied in recent years. Jehovah’s Witnesses, whose beliefs prevent them from fulfilling mandatory military conscription, face particular harassment.This edition of the State Department’s annual religious freedom report focused heavily on discrimination, impunity and the displacement of religious minorities.“In 2013, the world witnessed the largest displacement of religious communities in recent memory,” the report said. “In almost every corner of the globe, millions of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and others representing a range of faiths were forced from their homes on account of their religious beliefs. … Communities are disappearing from their traditional and historic homes and dispersing across the geographic map. In conflict zones, in particular, this mass displacement has become a pernicious norm.”CPCs were not the only offenders named. Kerry cited anti-Muslim sentiments in Europe and a poll from last year showing that nearly half of the local Jewish populations in some European countries had considered emigrating to escape anti-Semitism.The report summary also names Syria, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Iraq, Bangladesh, Indonesia, India and Nigeria for failing to protect vulnerable religious communities, which often face violence, discrimination and harassment.Kerry called the report “a clear-eyed objective look at the state of religious freedom around the world,” adding “it does directly shine a light in a way that makes some countries – even some of our friends – uncomfortable.” He called for the CPC designations to be grounded in real action that can help change reality on the ground.Although sobering, this year’s report is not without positive developments.Kerry mentioned Pakistani Muslims who formed human chains to protect Christian worshippers after a church bombing in Peshawar and a Jewish neighborhood watch team that helped Muslim leaders in London ensure safe access to mosques after a series of attacks.In April, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent watchdog panel created by Congress to review international religious freedom conditions, recommended that the State Department add Turkmenistan, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Syria to the list of CPCs.U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican and one of Congress’s staunchest advocates for a robust U.S. American foreign policy on religious freedom, said that while it makes sense to add Turkmenistan to the list, the report must be backed by a plan to address the persecution described within it.“My concern about the report is that it doesn’t lay out a strategy on the continued problems in China, in Vietnam,” he said, noting that the Chinese government is still detaining 2010 Nobel laureate and human rights campaigner Liu Xiaobo.“It’s one thing to say you have a problem,” Wolf said. “It’s another thing to say what as a nation you’re going to do about it.”USCIRF’s April report also recommended that the vacant post of ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom be filled quickly after Suzan Johnson Cook left that role in October.Hours before Kerry’s press conference on Monday, President Obama announced plans to tap Rabbi David Saperstein as the next ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom. Saperstein stood by Kerry’s side as the report’s key findings were discussed but refrained from speaking or answering questions from the audience. "

The demonstration was one of several nationwide calling for wages of $15 per hour and better working conditions for fast food workers. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3114c260000e900820531.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When 200 New York City fast-food workers walked off their jobs in November 2012, their demand of $15 an hour seemed like a fantasy.But over the weekend, as more than 1,000 fast-food workers from 50 cities gathered in Chicago for the first-ever nationwide fast-food workers convention, the workers' call for $15 looked prescient.In a little less than two years, the call for $15 per hour has spread far beyond the fast-food industry -- indeed, in its power to inspire all low-wage workers, the ""Fight for 15"" is akin to the movement for the 8-hour day roughly two centuries ago.While it's commonly taken for granted, today's standard 8-hour workday did not arrive by accident -- it began as a near-utopian demand from workers in industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing, where 15-hour days were the norm.But under pressure from strikes that gradually spread across the country, a growing number of cities and companies began granting 8-hour workdays near the end of the 19th century -- and eventually, this standard 40-hour workweek was extended to workers nationwide. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, signed into law by President Roosevelt in 1938. The call for a $15 per hour wage similarly began as an over-the-horizon demand from fast-food workers stuck in jobs that offer no benefits, limited hours, and a median hourly wage of only $8.69 per hour. Today, however, following nearly two years of strikes by fast-food workers, low-wage workers of all types have taken up the call for $15 per hour -- and this growing movement is already getting results.For example, in Baltimore earlier this month, service workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital reached a tentative agreement, after the threat of continued strikes, for a groundbreaking pay raise to $15 per hour. If finalized, this pay raise would substantially boost the wages of hundreds of low-paid janitors, cooks, housekeepers, and technicians, many of whom earn just above $10 per hour today.In Michigan, hamburger chain Moo Cluck Moo raised wages to $15. And out west, workers in the Los Angeles Unified School System--the nation's second largest--just won a near doubling of their wages, to $15. Also in Los Angeles, a proposal to establish a $15 per hour minimum wage for hotel workers throughout the city won unanimous approval from the City Council's Economic Development Committee earlier this year, setting the stage for a vote in the full City Council in the coming months. Local leaders in LA credited the ""tremendous energy"" created by striking low-wage workers across the country in spurring progress on this proposal. In November, voters in SeaTac, Washington approved the nation's first $15 minimum wage. And in June, the city of Seattle officially answered the rallying cry of fast food workers, approving the nation's first $15 citywide minimum wage. This historic development was followed just weeks later by the announcement of an agreement in San Francisco -- backed by local businesses -- to refer a measure setting a $15 citywide minimum wage to the city's voters this November.It's not hard to understand why the Fight for 15 would inspire workers across the economy to take action. Much like the 15-hour days that characterized America's 19th-century industrial economy, stagnant wages and low pay are the ""new normal"" for millions of workers in the U.S. For four decades wages have flat-lined even as worker productivity has continued to grow, and low-wage jobs now form the core of America's economy, comprising 8 of the 10 occupations with the largest projected growth over the next decade.Looking ahead, we can ask: Which state will be the first to set a $15 minimum wage? Which big fast-food company will be the first to guarantee a minimum hourly wage that is double the industry standard? When can we expect to see a living wage become a core labor standard guaranteed to all workers across the country?As fast-food workers gathered in Chicago to plot their next steps, one thing was clear: Their $15 demand could soon be as ordinary as the 8-hour day.
