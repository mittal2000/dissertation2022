According to the FDA, in order for a sunscreen to claim that it is broad spectrum",2012-06-19,"Willa Face The Day SPF30 Tinted Face Protection, $15",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9bdb5c2400005000947524.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Last week the FDA announced new rules for sunscreen labels that will go into effect within a year. And it's about time: In the last few years, the market has become over-saturated with sunscreens that make wild claims with even wilder SPF numbers. As a result, consumers grew increasingly more confused about what number sunscreen we should actually be wearing (a top dermatologist recently cleared it up for us). Fortunately, the days of waterproof SPF100+ are numbered. The FDA crackdown will bring a far less complicated labeling system to the shelves, and we can all rest a little easier knowing exactly which sunscreen we should be putting on. Here are the top four things you should know before restocking your summer 2012 sunscreen stash. And keep scrolling for seven options that get our sunburn-preventing, breakout-avoiding seal of approval.Understand what ""broad spectrum"" means. According to the FDA, in order for a sunscreen to claim that it is broad spectrum, it must ""provide protection against both ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) and ultraviolet A radiation (UVA)."" UVB radiation causes sunburns, while UVA causes wrinkling and premature aging; they both cause cancer. To protect against all types of sun damage, the label must be both ""broad spectrum"" and include SPF15 or higher. Know the difference between physical and chemical sunscreen. A physical sunscreen is just that: A physical UV filter deflects the sun. The ingredients zinc and titanium oxide lay on top of the skin to fend off harmful rays. A chemical sunscreen, on the other hand, employs chemical UV filters (avobenzone and oxybenzone are popular ingredients) and absorbs the sun's rays. Both have a few drawbacks: While chemical sunscreens are usually more liquid and runny, they can tend to be more irritating. Certain physical sunscreens can leave a whitish cast due to hard-to-blend formulas. Both are known to cause breakouts, unfortunately, though recent formulations have made vast improvements. Beware of these claims: Waterproof, sweatproof, sunblock and instant protection. If it says ""waterproof"" or ""sweatproof,"" the label is lying to you. There's no such thing. Another hot-button word is ""sunblock,"" which the FDA has also prohibited. Same goes for ""instant protection."" Sunscreens are not effective immediately after applying, thus they can't claim to be. (They generally take about 25-30 minutes to become effective.) Labels can, however, claim to be ""water resistant"" in increments of 40 to 80 minutes. Look for SPF30 or higher. (Seriously, just do it.) While sunscreens that are SPF15 or higher can claim to prevent sunburns, dermatologists generally agree that you should apply an SPF30 or higher. According to New York Dermatologist Dr. Anne Chapas: ""This is usually adequate for low levels of sun exposure. The number means that it would take 30 times longer to burn than not wearing any sunscreen. That means if it would take a minute to burn without sunscreen, it would take 30 minutes to burn after applying the recommended amount of SPF30.""For a more comprehensive run-down on the FDA's new sunscreen labeling rules, head over to the agency's site.Want more?

2,MONEY,Topless Models on the Rise Again in 2012,"Karl Brauer, Contributor

They aren't worth a million bucks yet, but low-mileage examples can command upwards of $50,000.",2012-06-19,2012-06-19-2012_nissan_murano_cross_cabriolet_sd_act.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-06-19-2012_nissan_murano_cross_cabriolet_sd_act.jpg,"Few may remember this, but in the mid-1970s the government threatened to introduce rollover standards that would have made convertible sales impossible in the U.S. -- or at least that's what many carmakers and car buyers thought. GM applied the ""last convertible"" tagline to the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado convertible in an attempt to juice sales before the model went out of production. Many buyers scooped up those $12,000 ""last convertibles"" thinking they had a million dollar investment that only need a few years to mature.And while economic and safety concerns of the late 1970s did slow the production and sale of convertibles in the U.S., it had little effect on drop-top sales in Europe and other countries. Once the economy took off again in the early 1980s, so did ragtops. We've never really backpedaled on that progress, with convertible offerings generally increasing over the past 30 years, and particularly over the past decade.In 2000, there were 37 convertible models for sale in the U.S., and by 2007 that number was up to 50. The number of convertible offerings (like so many statistics...) topped out in 2008, with 59 models. A slight drop in drop-tops offerings, down to 49 in 2010 and 2011, might have had people thinking they were a dying breed again.But in 2012 convertible numbers are back up to 53 models, with everything from tiny Smart cars to the truly bizarre Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet available to satisfy your topless needs.Total Car Score will release its Top 10 Convertibles for 2012 list tomorrow based on their aggregated ratings from across the industry. Total Car Score has identified the Top 10 Convertibles for 2012 based on their aggregated ratings from across the industry. We have also confirmed the Europeans still hold the advantage when it comes to appealing open-top cars. They hold eight of the 10 slots in the list, though Ford's Mustang represents the U.S. as the number three car, and Lexus maintains Japan's honor in slot nine.Given the quality of today's convertibles there's really no downside to buying one. You get all the fun and sun you'll want with the top down, yet they provide a quiet, serene cabin when the top goes up. The noisy, leaky and flexible convertibles of the past are gone today, even for ragtops not making this Top 10 list.Oh, and that 1976 Eldorado that was supposed to represent the ""last convertible"" 36 years ago? They aren't worth a million bucks yet, but low-mileage examples can command upwards of $50,000. Not bad, but you'd have been better off buying $12,000 worth of the very first Star Wars toys, and sticking them away instead..."

But it seems like scientists aren't content with fashion industry expertise, drawing up their own studies every couple of years to settle the horizontal vs. vertical (non)debate. According to the Telegraph, the latest experiment comes from Val Watham, who just won the BBCâ€™s Amateur Scientist of the Year award for her horizontal vs. vertical study. [Ed. note: are amateur scientists a thing?]Watham conducted her study by showing random strangers pictures of models in vertical stripes, horizontal stripes or head-to-toe black. Lo and behold, participants perceived the vertical-wearers as thinner, the horizontal-wearers as wider and the monochrome dressers the skinniest of all. Science!Lest you think this finding a forgone conclusion, however, know that in 2008, a different scientific study found that horizontal stripes make you look thinner. To which every fashion editor responded: Bitch, please.Next up: scientific studies on whether heels make you look tall, beige washes you out and high-waisted pants make you look thick around the middle.
