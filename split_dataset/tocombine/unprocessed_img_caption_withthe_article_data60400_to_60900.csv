1,ENTERTAINMENT,'Batman v Superman' Performed Well And Yet Terribly At The Weekend Box Office,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/batman-v-superman-box-office_us_57026f50e4b0a06d58061a24,Martha(s) can't help you now.,2016-04-04,"Fans wait for the arrival of cast members of the movie ""Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice"" in Mexico City, Mexico, March 19, 2016. REUTERS/Henry Romero",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570270951e0000b3007061c2.jpeg?cache=f4V5TXKo44&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" appears to be losing steam as it ends its second weekend in theaters.The critically loathed superhero movie topped the box office, picking up $52.4 million. However, that represented a steep 68% fall from its $166 million debut. It suggests that ""Batman v Superman"" will be a front-loaded blockbuster along the lines of ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" or ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" both of which earned a disproportionate share of their revenues in their initial weekends and suffered similar drop-offs.Domestically, the Warner Bros. release has picked up a hefty $261.4 million. The major problem facing the studio is it doesn't just need ""Batman v Superman"" to be a hit, it needs it to be so fervently embraced that fans will show up to see sequels and spin-offs for years to come. The film is intended to kick off an interconnected cinematic universe of DC Comics characters that Warner Bros. hopes will rival what Marvel has achieved with the Avengers films.There wasn't much in the way of competition. Most studios steered clear of the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel's on screen scuffle, preferring to hold their fire. The next big-budget studio release to hit theaters is Disney's ""The Jungle Book"" on April 15. In the interim, Pure Flix tried to engage faith-based audiences with ""God's Not Dead 2,"" a follow-up to the 2014 low-budget smash. The picture centers on a school teacher (Melissa Joan Hart, of ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" fame) who gets embroiled in a legal controversy after bringing up Jesus in class. The film wasn't as warmly embraced as its predecessor, pulling in $8.1 million for a fourth place finish, and trailing the original's $9.2 million launch, despite opening on 2,318 theaters, more than double the number of locations as the first ""God's Not Dead.""The weekend's other new release, Freestyle Releasing's ""Meet the Blacks,"" fared even worse. A parody of the film ""The Purge,"" the film did a tepid $4.1 million after debuting on 1,011 screens.Among holdovers, Disney's ""Zootopia"" took second place, with roughly $19.8 million, pushing the animated hit's domestic total to $ million. In its second weekend, Universal's ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" showed some endurance, racking up $11.1 million, a slender 38% drop from its opening weekend. The romantic comedy sequel has earned $36.5 million after two weeks of release. Sony's ""Miracles From Heaven"" rounded out the top five, grossing approximately $7.5 million and pushing its total to $46.8 million.Among indie films, Bleecker Street expanded the drone thriller ""Eye in the Sky"" from 123 theaters to 1,029, picking up $4 million. The film has earned $6.1 million in four weeks of release. Sony Pictures Classics debuted the Miles Davis biopic ""Miles Ahead"" in four theaters, where it grossed $122,751, for a per screen average of $30,688."

Wilson served as Princeton University's president from 1902 to 1910.[Read the news release from Princeton]The trustees adopted the recommendations of a special committee formed after Princetonstudents demonstrated and demanded the removal of Wilson's name on campus in November, amid a wave of protests at colleges across the United States over the treatment of minority students.In retaining Wilson's name, ""contextualization is imperative,"" the school's website cited the committee as saying Monday.[Read the trustees' report]Of particular concern are ""the position he took as Princeton's president to prevent the enrollment of black students and the policies he instituted as U.S. president that resulted in the re-segregation of the federal civil service,"" the committee said.""Wilson, like other historical figures, leaves behind a complex legacy of both positive and negative repercussions.

3,POLITICS,Donald Trump Still Stimulates Democratic Anxiety Disorder,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-donald-trump_us_56fd98b8e4b0a06d58055704,"""This is not a slam dunk,"" Martin O'Malley warns.",2016-04-04,Donald Trump seems incredibly vulnerable in a general election. But not all Democrats are convinced. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley warned his fellow Democrats not to take too lightly the general election threat posed by Donald Trump. In a forum co-hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the ""Candidate Confessional"" podcast, O'Malley called the broad dismissal of Trump's White House prospects elitist -- the result of punditry that's divorced from an increasingly angered electorate.""There's a certain smugness inside the beltway in Washington,"" O'Malley said. ""I think we have our work cut out for us. This could be a very, very defining moment in the life of our republic. And I think that we have our work cut out for us in the general.""""This is not a slam dunk,"" O'Malley added.The dire warnings from the former 2016 presidential candidate came just under two weeks ago. So it's possible that he's feeling more bullish about his party's standing these days, after Trump's series of self-inflicted gashes: a since-reversed call to punish women who get abortions, revelations that his campaign manager actually did grab a female reporter, and so on. But O'Malley's case for taking the real estate tycoon seriously was based more on the economic conditions that allowed his rise, than the idiosyncratic character flaws that seem to portend his fall. The country, O'Malley insisted, is quite angry with the status quo, and he knows better than most.""I saw Vice President Gore about three weeks ago,"" O'Malley said. ""He asked me afterwards, 'What surprised you most about the process?' And I said, 'What surprised me most was not only the depth and the breadth of people's anger, but the patience of it.' There are a lot of people that just want to pull into the angry lane, park the car, and toss the keys out the window. And they ain't leaving.""O'Malley was in many ways a victim of that anger. Not because voters disapproved with his message, but because they latched on to another candidate who channelled their frustrations better. While O'Malley ran as a progressive with a record, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ran as a populist. That Sanders was still campaigning while O'Malley was recording the live-show podcast showed which approach had more potency. ""I guess by the end of the summer and after that first debate or two, it became pretty clear that his candidacy was not waning, it was at least going to hold with where it was,"" O'Malley said, when asked when he knew that the Sanders phenomenon would be just that. ""That became clear. There were times when I sensed it was starting to dip. People had been to see him a couple times and he tended not to do the questions and answers that are part of the culture of running in the Iowa caucuses. But ultimately he had the money to sustain it. So at the very moment that he seemed to be waning in the late summer time, he was able to go on the air shortly thereafter."" It wasn't just a mistimed message that doomed O'Malley. The debate schedule that the Democratic National Committee put in place didn't help either. And the self-perpetuating loop of fundraising futility -- in which you can't raise money because you're polling in single digits and you can't break out of single digits because you don't have money -- also played a role. ""At least two hours a day, I spent calling a lot of very wealthy people who had been members of President Obama's finance committee, who had not decided to commit to Secretary Clinton,"" O'Malley said. ""If we had gotten more traction earlier in Iowa, we probably could have coaxed more out of them out of their shelves. But as the dynamic of the race proceeded, by the time Vice President [Joe] Biden decided to take his foot out of the pool, a lot of those finance types had decided not to get involved at all.""For all those vexations, O'Malley said he enjoyed his time on the trail. And he encouraged the students in attendance to dip their toes into politics, if only to effect the type of social change that they wanted. As for whether he'd join them, O'Malley ducked a question of which cabinet position he'd prefer in a prospective Sanders or Clinton administration. And he doesn't seem keen on taking another stab at the Oval Office. O'Malley, toward the end of the interview, recounted how a man in Iowa approached him and -- with the campaign clearly not looking so healthy at that point -- pleaded with him to ""promise"" that he'd run again. ""And I said to him, 'No!'"" O'Malley said. His son, William, was with him as the interaction took place. When it was done, he turned to his dad: ""It is like volunteering for a second waterboarding before the first one is done.""Listen to the podcast above, or download it on iTunes.

4,POLITICS,The Crazy GOP Presidential Convention Scenario Almost No One Is Talking About,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-convention-vice-president_us_570277e8e4b0a06d58061e50,Delegates must also vote in a vice presidential nominee.,2016-04-04,Establishment Republicans could push for a more palatable vice presidential nominee if Donald Trump wins the presidential nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570293a61e0000b300706218.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination moved into a new phase over the last week as campaigns began to jockey behind the scenes to ensure delegates friendly to their candidate appear at the party's nominating convention later this summer.Over the weekend in North Dakota, for example, allies of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz prevailed, claiming a majority of crucial unbound delegates -- delegates who are not bound to vote for any candidate during the first ballot at the convention. It's a playbook that anti-Donald Trump forces plan to repeat at upcoming state GOP conventions in hopes of denying the front-runner the necessary number of delegates required to secure the nomination.But there's one wild scenario not many people are talking about: the vice presidential nomination.As is the case for president, the delegates in Cleveland must also vote in their choice for vice president of the United States. Typically, the presumptive nominee makes a decision on his or her running mate before the party's convention, making the process of voting for the vice presidential nomination little more than a procedural check mark. In 2012, for example, Mitt Romney announced his running mate -- current House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) -- several weeks before the convention. If the three-man race between Trump, Cruz, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich truly drags into July and sets up a contested convention, as is looking likely, the GOP will have to select not just one but two wild-card candidates for the White House.What makes the whole thing even more unpredictable is that, unlike the vote for the presidential nominee, delegates are completely unbound in voting for their candidates' running mate, as Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus noted on Monday. ""I do think it’s curious that people aren’t talking about [it], they’re talking about an open convention and the votes for the nominees, but people aren’t talking about the vote for VP. It could be quite amazing if that were to happen,"" Priebus told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.""Everyone’s unbound. I mean, that’s the other thing. There’s no binding. There’s no first and second ballot binding. It’s just a free vote,"" he added.Presumably, if the convention settled on a candidate squarely on the first or second ballot, the delegates would defer to their candidate's decision for a running mate. But if multiple ballots take place with no clear resolution, the backlash could spill over into the vote for the vice presidential nominee. One could for instance foresee a scenario in which Trump wins the nomination, but establishment forces push for a more palatable choice as their vice presidential nominee as a check against Trump's candidacy in the general election."

HBO has mercilessly teased the return of ""Game of Thrones"" over the past few months with highly suggestive promotional material hinting at the possible reappearance of Jon Snow. Now it's only fair to turn the tables and enact some revenge, Targaryen-style. In case you thought ""Carpool Karaoke"" was creative, Harington visited the U.K.'s ""Jonathan Ross Show"" only to be subjected to a lie detector test that shocked him for every unsatisfactory answer.Yeah, they do it way better over there. Ross forced Harington to stick his hand in The Stone of Truth (obviously a distant cousin of the Olmec Head from ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"") and peppered the actor with questions about his ""Game of Thrones"" role. ""Are you dead?"" Ross asked first, with Harington answering with an unequivocal yes. Unfortunately, the lie detector test didn't reveal any particularly new information, aside from confirming that Snow will not become a White Walker and Harington has a far lower pain tolerance level than his alter ego. Luckily, we didn't need The Stone of Truth to learn more about the actor's personal life. The 29-year-old and his former on-screen co-star Rose Leslie made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Olivier Awards in London on Sunday. Finally, a happy ending. "

But a grand jury disagreed, and on Thursday returned an indictment alleging that Colbert and Gregg had conspired to get the driver and his passenger to hand over the cash in exchange for not pursuing drug charges.Colbert and Gragg were booked into jail on Thursday and immediately released on bond. The panel has also recommended Colbert be removed from office.The case comes as Oklahoma lawmakers and law enforcement groups spar over the practice of civil asset forfeiture, which allows police to seize and permanently confiscate cash and property, such as houses, vehicles and jewelry, from civilians. While officers base these seizures on allegations that the property is connected to criminal activity, police don't have to charge the owner with a crime, much less obtain a conviction. In many cases, police strip people of their property without even having to prove the supposed connection to criminal activity.Critics of civil asset forfeiture say it has created a system of policing for profit, in which law enforcement agencies prioritize seizing property that can financially benefit their department over ensuring public safety through a neutral administration of the law. Weak protections for property owners further enable abuse and allow police to take property without due process, advocates for reform say.

""The Sheriff’s Office timely deposited every cent of this money in the county’s treasurer account as required by state law. This money was earmarked for fighting drug trafficking to help protect the citizens.""Hughes also claimed there is no evidence to support the accusation that jail records were deleted.While this alleged exchange of cash for more lenient treatment may appear highly dubious, it's standard operating procedure for many law enforcement agencies, said Dan Alban, an attorney at Institute for Justice, a libertarian public interest law firm that advocates for the end of civil forfeiture.""This is how law enforcement butters their bread,"" he told The Huffington Post.

9,POLITICS,Supreme Court Deals A Blow To Conservatives In Major Voting Rights Case,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-evenwel-v-abbott_us_57028dcce4b0daf53af02289,A different ruling would have shifted power away from Democratic-leaning areas.,2016-04-04,"Activists hold signs in front of the Supreme Court on Dec. 8, 2015, before oral arguments on Evenwel v. Abbott. The case considered whether voting districts should be changed to only count citizens who could vote. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57028ea21e0000870070620b.jpeg?ops=crop_0_6_3000_1563%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrats and voting rights advocates won a huge victory at the Supreme Court on Monday with a unanimous decision preserving the way state legislative districts are currently drawn. In the case Evenwel v. Abbott, conservatives in Texas argued that the votes of eligible voters -- like themselves -- are unconstitutionally diluted because their state counts nonvoters when drawing its legislative districts. Specifically, Texas uses total population data, which includes children, inmates, disenfranchised ex-felons, noncitizen immigrants and others who are unable to vote. The appellants, backed by the activist nonprofit Project on Fair Representation, argued the state should be prohibited from drawing districts in the manner that it currently does. They proposed that the state should instead be required to draw districts by considering the total number of eligible voters or registered voters in a given area. A three-judge panel of a district court in Texas ruled against them in 2014, so they took their case to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in December.A decision in the appellants’ favor would have shifted political power away from urban, younger, more Latino and therefore more Democratic-leaning areas toward rural, older, more white and therefore more Republican-leaning regions of the state. An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice in December found that a ruling in favor of the appellants would upend every state’s electoral map, rendering them “presumptively unconstitutional” and in need of redrawing. But all eight Supreme Court justices decided to preserve the status quo Monday. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito agreed with the outcome of the case, but wrote separate concurring opinions to lay out different reasons for their votes.“As constitutional history, precedent, and practice demonstrate, a State or locality may draw its legislative districts based on total population,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court's majority.“The Framers recognized that use of a total-population baseline served the principle of representational equality,” Ginsburg continued, arguing that state legislators should be responsive to the concerns of all of their constituents, not just those who can vote.“Adopting voter-eligible apportionment as constitutional command would upset a well-functioning approach to districting that all 50 States and countless local jurisdictions have long followed. ... Nonvoters have an important stake in many policy debates and in receiving constituent services,"" she explained. ""By ensuring that each representative is subject to requests and suggestions from the same number of constituents, total-population apportionment promotes equitable and effective representation.” While the appellants’ case was considered a long shot because it would require states to draw their districts using datasets that do not actually exist, voting rights experts had feared that the court would open the door to Texas’ suggestion that states may choose to use other metrics to draw their lines, like eligible voter or registered voter data.The court said it didn’t have to answer that question. “Because constitutional history, precedent, and practice reveal the infirmity of [the] appellants’ claim, this Court need not resolve whether, as Texas now argues, States may draw districts to equalize voter eligible population rather than total population,” Ginsburg concluded.Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, commended the justices for maintaining ""the fundamental principle of one person, one vote.""“We applaud the Supreme Court for unanimously upholding one of the most basic principles in American democracy – that every person counts when it comes to ensuring fair and equal representation in the redistricting process,” Clarke said. “Today’s decision renders null and void efforts to marginalize minority communities from having an equal seat at the table in our political process.”Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also expressed support for the court's ruling. Before considering this case, the Supreme Court had never specifically addressed whether state legislative districts should have roughly the same number of people or the same number of eligible voters. The 14th Amendment says that the census must count “the whole number of persons in each State” every 10 years for the purpose of apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. But it does not explicitly address how to draw state legislative districts. Federal courts have consistently ruled that using total population to draw the districts is acceptable.The Evenwel case was brought by the same conservative advocate, Edward Blum, who was behind Shelby County v. Holder, which allowed the Supreme Court’s then-five conservative justices to justify gutting the Voting Rights Act in 2013.""We are disappointed that the justices were unwilling to re-establish the original principle of one-person, one-vote for the citizens of Texas and elsewhere,"" Blum said in a statement."

The Department of Justice is investigating Maricopa County after voters had problems casting ballots last month.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5702ba192e00002d0095062e.jpeg?ops=crop_0_600_3500_1733%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The federal government is investigating Arizona’s most populous county after its dramatic decrease in voting sites led to long lines during the state’s primary last month.Elizabeth Bartholomew, communications manager for the the Recorder’s Office in Maricopa County, said the office received a letter from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division on Friday. Bartholomew said the feds want specific data about the office's reason for cutting the number of polling places. She said the office “absolutely” plans to cooperate with the investigation and to provide federal officials with the requested information in the coming weeks.“We have no problem cooperating with them, so we should have that over to them over the next couple of weeks,” she told The Huffington Post on Monday.The county cut its voting sites from 200 during the 2012 presidential primary to just 60 for this year's March 22 primary. Some Arizona voters reported waiting in line for five hours to cast their ballot, long after the GOP race was called for reality television star Donald Trump and the Democratic primary was called for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell (R), who is in charge of the county’s elections, partially blamed “the voters, for getting in line,” but later admitted that the county made “bad decisions” and “miscalculated” how many voting sites it would need.County officials argued earlier this year that having fewer sites would save money. Purcell recommended that the county’s Board of Supervisors reduce the number of polling sites because her office suspected more people would vote early by mail. However, fewer people voted by mail than the office had predicted.The county probably wouldn’t have been able to cut as many polling places as it did if the full force of the Voting Rights Act was still in effect; the Supreme Court gutted the landmark civil rights legislation in a controversial 5-4 decision in 2013. Before that ruling, states with a long history of racial discrimination, such as Arizona, were required to get permission from the DOJ or in federal court to change their election procedures or laws. States asking for approval of their proposed election changes had to show that such measures wouldn’t leave voters of color worse off. But, as Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton (D) pointed out in a letter asking the DOJ to investigate the county, Maricopa “distributed fewer polling locations to parts of the county with higher minority populations.”Stanton wrote that Phoenix, a majority-minority city, had one polling place for every 108,000 residents, while predominantly white communities hosted more polling sites for significantly smaller populations. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said in a statement after the primary that he wanted election officials to investigate why lines outside polling places were so long. He called for making the state’s primaries open, rather than closed, so independent voters could participate, without mentioning that the state should allocate more funds to open more polling sites. Lines weren’t the only problem in Maricopa, however. Some voters reported that the county had switched their party registration, possibly due to a computer glitch. Thousands of voters were forced to cast provisional ballots as a result. "

Since 2013, its Rian Fried Center has run courses on sustainable agriculture and food systems.As The Associated Press noted a few years ago, the number of such programs has been surging as the agricultural industry looks to lure younger generations back to the farming life. The Sustainable Agriculture Education Association lists 38 land-grant universities, 15 other four-year public or private universities, and seven liberal arts colleges across North America that offer some kind of degree or certificate program that falls under the sustainable agriculture umbrella.Sterling, which was founded in 1958 as a boys’ prep school and has been an accredited four-year college since 1997, was well ahead of the trend. Nicole Civita, assistant director of the Rian Fried Center, said the school has been offering sustainable agriculture as an area of study for more than 40 years.In the last five or 10 years, Sterling has noticed an uptick in interest, which Civita credits to a larger societal shift.“I think our society writ large is coming to realize the urgency of the challenges of climate change and income inequality and a variety of ecological and social challenges we have to meet,” Civita said. “We’re starting to look more certainly and more optimistically at solutions that may be a bit more simple, person-powered and community-based.”In recognition of that broadening interest, the school is taking its sustainable course offerings a step further with its inaugural School of the New American Farmstead this summer.The program will provide intensive continuing-education courses taught largely by guest instructors who ordinarily wouldn’t be able to commit to a full semester of teaching in Vermont. One high-profile offering is ""Food Writing From the Farm,"" which will feature acclaimed chef and author Ruth Reichl among the teaching staff.Another summer course on regenerative farming looks particularly topical. A recently published book from Yale University lecturer Eric Toensmeier has sparked interest in the potential benefits of ""carbon farming."" Carbon farming, as Toensmeier explains in The Carbon Farming Solution, refers generally to agricultural practices that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and retain it in soil or trees. The agricultural industry is responsible for a significant share -- at least 14 percent, though estimates vary -- of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Carbon farming can reduce those emissions and help mitigate the effects of climate change.There is more than one way to ""farm"" carbon, of course, as Toensmeier explained last month during an interview with HuffPost Rise.The regenerative agriculture course will be taught by Darren Doherty, an Australian farmer, author and leading advocate for carbon farming. Through his Regrarians initiative, Doherty seeks to train other farmers in how to take better care of their land. The Sterling class will entail a site analysis of the school's lands addressing the 10 points of the Regrarians platform, including climate, geography, water, soil and energy. It is part of an effort, Civita said, to go beyond “sustaining” something that may already be impoverished, like soil, and learning how to restore it.Critics of sustainable agriculture practices often argue that they cannot produce the crop yields of conventional farming, which is especially problematic at a time when the world’s population is growing. In sustainable farming's defense, people like former New York Times columnist Mark Bittman have pointed out that conventional farming isn't perfect either. As Polyface farmer Joel Salatin, spotlighted in Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, argues, the current food system favors industrial farms to such a degree that it's difficult to compare their operations with sustainable and organic efforts.Sterling is not deterred by the hurdles ahead.“It’s very true we’re a small college, but we speak with a very large voice,” said Feuerstein, adding, “We’re seeing people come around to practices we’ve had in place since the ‘70s.”"

As Polyface farmer Joel Salatin, spotlighted in Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, argues, the current food system favors industrial farms to such a degree that it's difficult to compare their operations with sustainable and organic efforts.Sterling is not deterred by the hurdles ahead.“It’s very true we’re a small college, but we speak with a very large voice,” said Feuerstein, adding, “We’re seeing people come around to practices we’ve had in place since the ‘70s.”"

The current crisis begs the question of how the situation can be de-escalated without being exacerbated. Many look to the African Union (AU), Belgium (Burundi’s former colonial power), and a small handful of important aid donors, like the European Union, the Netherlands, and the United States, for solutions. But what have these external actors done so far? Are they capable of doing more? If so, what would be the consequences of the aforementioned actors’ increased involvement in solving the crisis?The main tools used by the international community, namely leveraging its control over financial aid to influence the government in Bujumbura, are vital to understanding where Burundi is headed. Given that foreign assistance represents almost one-third of the Burundian economy, the consequences of removing aid are complex and potentially devastating for the African nation.Burundi emerged from a decade of inter-ethnic violence and civil war in 2005. As part of a negotiated settlement between the warring parties, the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis formed a joint power-sharing government, which kept peace in the country until the spring of 2015. However, violence broke out following a brutal crackdown on protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza, after his controversial announcement that he intended to run for a third term – despite the two-term limit set forth by the country’s constitution.A period dubbed “La Crise” ensued, marked by violent confrontations between security forces and demonstrators, a failed coup d’état, a highly controversial presidential election, countless arbitrary arrests, and a large number of targeted extrajudicial killings. Government violence against protesters invoked Burundians’ fearful memories of the civil war that killed over 300,000 only ten years prior. Many Burundians, fearing the beginnings of another genocide akin to those of 1972 and 1992, have fled to neighboring countries.Many compare the recent violence in Burundi to the chaos that plagued Rwanda from mid-1993 to early 1994 – particularly in relation to the lead up to Rwanda’s hundred-day genocide, during which an extremist Hutu government killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Though there were signs of an impending genocide before it actually happened, the international community never implemented measures to prevent the mass murder. The AU, Belgium, and other aid giving nations today appear similarly unresponsive to the signs pointing to another potential genocide, only this time in Burundi.It is worth noting that in late 2015 the AU called for a rapid military intervention via the deployment of 5,000 sub-regional troops from the Eastern African Standby Force (EASF). The AU hoped that the troops would deter the Burundian state from inflicting mass violence against its own civilians and would prevent the aggravation of an already fragile situation. While the effort was commendable, the task at hand for EASF remains far from easy and necessitates additional commitment.The AU may not be able to intervene rapidly enough on its own, especially in the face of a hostile Burundian government. The UK Minister for Africa, James Duddridge, argued in December 2015 that the EASF is not prepared to intervene to stop the potential outbreak of civil war or widespread killing in Burundi and would need significant extra-continental assistance. Perhaps more troubling is the United Nations’ admission that it is even less prepared for the current situation in Burundi than it was for that of Rwanda in 1994. In light of these failures, one is inclined to wonder what viable recourse remains.Beyond military means, the international community has encouraged the Nkurunziza regime and the opposition to find a peaceful resolution using two methods: targeted, individual travel and financial sanctions, and general economic aid conditionality. International donors are attempting to leverage Burundi’s dependence on aid to influence the government’s behavior. Aid dependence arises when a country’s government cannot perform core functions, such as providing basic services for its citizens, without foreign assistance, either in the form of financial support or expertise. Aid dependence (quantitatively measured in foreign aid as a part of the overall economy) is key to understanding how conditionality works. According to foreign aid sanctions specialist Gordon Crawford, “the degree of effectiveness of political conditionality will be in direct proportion to the degree of aid dependency.” Thus, it would be logical to assume that “a highly aid dependent country should be receptive to demands for change in return for assistance.” Simply put, these countries need the money and will do almost anything asked of them in order to keep the foreign aid flowing in.Burundi’s dependence on foreign assistance increased dramatically after the end of the civil war in 2005, making the country one of the most aid dependent countries in the world. Since 2005, net official development assistance (ODA) has represented just under one-third of Burundi’s GNI and about half of its government expenditures. In 2013, annual development assistance equaled $57.41 per person —a large amount considering that Burundi’s GNI per capita was only $250 in the same year.According to the East African, between April and November of 2015, four of Burundi’s top aid suppliers withheld approximately $190 million in economic assistance in an effort to push the Nkurunziza regime to enter into negotiations with the opposition. Belgium alone suspended more than €60 million of foreign economic aid, while the EU began to reassess its plan to give half a billion euros as development assistance. These reductions in foreign aid have left Bujumbura struggling to meet its financial obligations, with no real alternative funding available.Major aid providers look to leverage Burundi’s dependence on assistance to bring the regime and the opposition to the negotiating table, as well as to deter the regime from committing human rights abuses. However, withholding crucial aid stands to destabilize the country. Imposing aid conditionality could push the regime toward increasingly extreme actions meant to compensate for its inability to carry out state functions.It is also important to consider whether aid conditionality can effectively address the root cause of the violence in Burundi. Donald Rothchild, an Africa expert at the University of California, Davis, notes that “conditionality is most frequently viewed as a coercive incentive, or even a punishment (i.e. aid suspension)… with a desire to change preferences of the target state… leading to compliance with a proposed course of action.” This underscores the fact that caution is needed in using aid conditionality as punishment, lest donors further alienate the aid recipient, whose cooperation is paramount.Donors have used aid conditionality on two separate occasions during the current Burundian crisis. The first was in mid-May, 2015, in response to the government’s violent crackdown on anti-Nkurunziza protesters. The second took place six months later, in November, 2015, when major aid providers cut assistance to the country as a way to compel the Burundian government to negotiate more seriously with the opposition and halt its human rights violations.However, despite attempts by donors to incentivize the Burundian government to pursue policy changes by withholding foreign aid, the government has largely remained unmoved. A number of unexpected consequences, however, have arisen. First, the reductions in aid have hit the Burundian government hard, making it difficult to pay bureaucrats, police, and the army. In addition, donor aid conditionality has pushed the economy into a free-fall. In October of 2015, the World Bank predicted that Burundi’s economy would diminish by 2.3 percent, which is still far more optimistic than the International Monetary Fund’s projection of a 7.2 percent contraction.What is at risk today is an economic meltdown largely induced by a dramatic reduction in foreign aid. We must be concerned about the real impact of aid conditionality on Burundi. As with most sanctions, there is a great deal of uncertainty about what will happen when donor assistance is withheld under such circumstances. Given Nkurunziza’s resilience in the face of economic hardship so far, it seems donors may not have the leverage that they expect. What we should fear now are the actions of desperate Burundian officials, as their house of cards collapses around them when the money runs out.

It's designed to be dropped into most any setting where people need medical attention but can't get it due to infrastructure problems.People living in rural Malawi, for instance, lack easy access to electricity and piped water, which means it's not really possible for them to undergo potentially lifesaving surgeries without traveling to an urban center -- even in a relatively routine situation like childbirth.The Sterile Box provides a few solutions.

Surgery doesn't happen in the unit itself, but it's there to provide clean tools, light and electricity to doctors.Douglas Schuler, an associate business professor at Rice University in Houston, Texas, came up with the concept after considering a previous invention from his father-in-law, Jean Boubour. In the 1980s, Boubour conceived of a solar-powered thermal cooking system -- ""It's a mouthful,"" Schuler concedes -- which would allow people to prepare food without fuel.Schuler told The Huffington Post that he tried to build a business around a similar cooking device in 2008. He got a grant to try it in Haiti, but it fizzled.""It was a total bust,"" Schuler said. ""The thing works well, but everyone didn't like using it.""So, he turned his attention to a different application for the technology.In 2012, he came up with a way to use solar power to sterilize tools. Then, he started working on a way to house the technology in a truly functional space.""[Hospitals] have this big segregation from dirty side to clean sides,"" Schuler told HuffPost. ""I thought, 'I wonder if we can take what they do in modern hospitals and do it in a small space, a small space that you could conceivably put somewhere fairly easy.'""The fact that the Sterile Box is solar-powered solves a major resource issue. Steam sterilization requires energy to generate high enough temperatures and destroy harmful microorganisms. In developing countries, medical professionals' fuel requirements are often met via tanks of propane, which are in limited supply.As an additional bonus, the Sterile Box contains electrical outlets, so people can charge their cellphones. Phones are common in sub-Saharan Africa, but finding a place to charge them can be difficult -- and costly -- in areas lacking infrastructure.Gadgets aside, Schuler said he thinks the Sterile Box will be particularly useful for helping mothers in childbirth, in addition to overall obstetrics and gynecology. Solar-powered tools have already been deployed to help women in parts of Africa, and Schuler believes there are 900 potential sites in sub-Saharan Africa where the Sterile Box could be deployed. It's a matter of finding the right partnership now.""You're not going to put this on the top of the mountain, or out on the desert,"" Schuler told HuffPost. ""It's not for hermits out in the desert.

In the 1980s, Boubour conceived of a solar-powered thermal cooking system -- ""It's a mouthful,"" Schuler concedes -- which would allow people to prepare food without fuel.Schuler told The Huffington Post that he tried to build a business around a similar cooking device in 2008. He got a grant to try it in Haiti, but it fizzled.""It was a total bust,"" Schuler said. ""The thing works well, but everyone didn't like using it.""So, he turned his attention to a different application for the technology.In 2012, he came up with a way to use solar power to sterilize tools. Then, he started working on a way to house the technology in a truly functional space.""[Hospitals] have this big segregation from dirty side to clean sides,"" Schuler told HuffPost. ""I thought, 'I wonder if we can take what they do in modern hospitals and do it in a small space, a small space that you could conceivably put somewhere fairly easy.'""The fact that the Sterile Box is solar-powered solves a major resource issue. Steam sterilization requires energy to generate high enough temperatures and destroy harmful microorganisms. In developing countries, medical professionals' fuel requirements are often met via tanks of propane, which are in limited supply.As an additional bonus, the Sterile Box contains electrical outlets, so people can charge their cellphones. Phones are common in sub-Saharan Africa, but finding a place to charge them can be difficult -- and costly -- in areas lacking infrastructure.Gadgets aside, Schuler said he thinks the Sterile Box will be particularly useful for helping mothers in childbirth, in addition to overall obstetrics and gynecology. Solar-powered tools have already been deployed to help women in parts of Africa, and Schuler believes there are 900 potential sites in sub-Saharan Africa where the Sterile Box could be deployed. It's a matter of finding the right partnership now.""You're not going to put this on the top of the mountain, or out on the desert,"" Schuler told HuffPost. ""It's not for hermits out in the desert. It's gotta be where people live."""

The authors noted that this isn’t a concern limited to low-income countries.The duration of breastfeeding is actually higher in poorer countries and the benefits span the socioeconomic divide. According to the report, breastfeeding was found to reduce instances of sudden infant death syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis, a disorder with a high mortality rate that most often occurs in sick or premature babies. Breastfed babies were found to have higher intelligence than those who were breastfed for shorter periods or not at all. It guards against diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections and could lower the risk of developing diabetes and becoming overweight.It benefits the nursing mother too. Breastfeeding protects against breast cancer and might also protect against ovarian cancer and type-2 diabetes.Despite the overwhelming advantages though, the global rate of breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months still falls short of the World Health Organization’s target. In 2013, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding reached 35 percent.The duration for which mothers breastfeed is actually lower in wealthy countries than in poorer countries. In low-income countries, most babies are still breastfed at 1 year. That figure is less than 20 percent in many high-income countries, according to the report. The authors noted that the reasons women avoid or curtail breastfeeding is often due to issues that “are not trivial.” Women face medical, cultural and psychological hindrances. And without sufficient support, moms often have no choice but to turn to formula feeding. Another issue is the fact that the breast milk substitute industry, which is expected to reach $70 billion by 2019, spends more on promoting its products than governments do on protecting and supporting breastfeeding. And their marketing tactics often involve undermining moms’ confidence about breastfeeding.The authors called for an “urgent” commitment from governments and health authorities to make breastfeeding a feasible option. While it lauded the Affordable Health Care Act for providing protected nursing breaks and insurance coverage for breast pumps, which could increase breastfeeding by 25 percent in the U.S., the authors urged for something more.“A new normal: where every woman can expect to breastfeed, and to receive every support she needs to do so.”The authors also touted the overarching results, beyond the benefits for mother and baby, that breastfeeding could engender. They found that a rise in breastfeeding could help contribute to reaching a number of the U.N’s Sustainable Development Goals.It can help ensure environmental sustainability due to the fact that breast milk is a “natural, renewable food” that’s delivered without pollution or unnecessary packaging.It can help improve education rates and end poverty since breastfeeding is linked to higher IQs, which in turn, is associated with higher hourly earnings, according to the report. The adverse effect not breastfeeding has on intelligence and income costs about $302 billion.To increase the figures, though, leaders need to scale up campaigns to educate women in the developing world, support mothers in the workplace and better regulate the breast milk substitute industry, the Lancet stated.“Breastfeeding is one of the most cost-effective interventions for newborn health,” Brigid McConville, director of the maternal health group White Ribbon Alliance, told the Guardian, “but the support needed is too often lacking.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The very trafficking crisis a U.K. leader warned against has landed in his country.After the Nepal earthquake last year, which left 950,000 children in makeshift tents, on the streets or out of school, advocates feared that the vulnerable demographic would get bought and sold by traffickers. Former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown was one of the experts who spoke out then, and children from the area are now being sold to British families to work as domestic slaves, a recent Sun report found.An investigation by the British newspaper found that Nepalese boys and girls as young as 10 years old are being sold for 5,300 British pounds (about $7,500). They’re being peddled to cook and clean for wealthy British families, according to the report, and Theresa May, home secretary, is urging police to investigate the claims.“No child, anywhere in the world, should be taken away from their home and forced to work in slavery,” May told the paper.Child trafficking was already a major concern in Nepal before the earthquake hit and the natural disaster has just exacerbated the situation.In a HuffPost blog post last year, Gordon noted that about 7,000 to 15,000 girls and young women are trafficked each year from Nepal into Indian brothels. Desperate parents who lost everything due to the earthquake were more likely to fall for traffickers’ schemes, experts warned at the time.“Loss of livelihoods and worsening living conditions may allow traffickers to easily convince parents to give their children up for what they are made to believe will be a better life,” Tomoo Hozumi, UNICEF Nepal representative, said in a statement last June. “The traffickers promise education, meals and a better future. But the reality is that many of those children could end up being horrendously exploited and abused.”After the earthquake hit, UNICEF ramped up its efforts to protect vulnerable children and at least 245 children were rescued from getting trafficked or illegally placed in children’s care homes, in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, according to the aid group.Still, wily traffickers have managed to prevail. Brown noted in his blog post that traffickers were slated to make $570 off each child they supplied.To help better protect vulnerable Nepalese children, the country temporarily suspended international adoptions and banned children from traveling between districts without a parent or guardian after the earthquake. UNICEF also urged airlines to be more vigilant and screen passengers traveling with children.The U.K. also accelerated its efforts to fight child trafficking by passing the Modern Slavery Act last year. The legislation ensures that authorities have the tools to combat modern slavery, survivors get proper resources and traffickers receive “suitably severe punishments for these appalling crimes.”"

Syrian refugees arrived in Germany and Finland from Istanbul on Monday as part of the agreement.That agreement, however, does not include 50,000 migrants and refugees who arrived in Greece prior to the deal, and have been stuck there since European countries closed off the Balkan trail.

This week, we learned the final straw for Olbermann was Trump's claim that he could shoot people and it wouldn't hurt his popularity. “The day that I actually said, 'I gotta get back into this, and I’ve gotta get out of this house,' was when Donald Trump said, boastfully, that if he went out onto Fifth Avenue and shot people, it wouldn’t impact his campaign negatively,"" Olbermann told Bill Simmons on a podcast released this week.(Discussion of Trump Tower begins around 6:20.)In addition to the general idea of violence, Olbermann took issue with ""the idea that [Trump] would view that as part of the political calculus."" Olbermann interpreted Trump’s statement to mean that he didn’t care about anyone in New York City, and ""without this city, he would be selling newspapers in an outdoor stand outside Madison Square Garden. He wouldn’t even have one of the indoor stations in Penn Station.""Further, Olbermann was repulsed by the ""impunity"" he detected in Trump’s statement -- that his followers somehow would remain loyal, even if the billionaire went on a shooting spree in Manhattan. ""[They] wouldn’t ... swerve away from this semi-fascist freight train that he’s driving,"" Olbermann said.Olbermann announced his departure from the New York City apartment building in a Washington Post op-ed published in March. “I’m getting out because of the degree to which the very name ‘Trump’ has degraded the public discourse and the nation itself,"" he wrote. ""I can’t hear, or see, or say that name any longer without spitting. Frankly, I’m running out of Trump spit.” Olbermann has also vowed to come out of retirement to wage a war of words against Trump. The veteran journalist, who has worked at more cable news outfits than can be named in a single sentence, said that he didn’t have anything lined up yet.""I'm going to do it one way or another, even if I'm just writing, I'm going to be doing something the rest of the [campaign],"" he told Simmons.Olbermann wants to have his ""opinions known on a regular, perhaps hourly basis somewhere,"" he said. He also hinted that he might look outside of mainstream media for a place to criticize Trump, whom Olbermann has called the ""most dangerous presidential candidate” since the Civil War.Despite his reputation as a difficult employee and a demanding boss, Olbermann was for a time an influential voice among liberals, especially in his criticism of the George W. Bush administration. On MSNBC, Olbermann's acerbic wit and angry commentary resonated with Americans who despised the Bush administration, as well as those who wanted an immediate end to the war in Iraq.

But Donald Trump, when asked by CNN why he’d spread such a thing, pretended to be completely unaware.“I thought it was a nice picture of Heidi,” he explained.Obviously, he was lying.And this weekend, he basically confirmed that. Pressed by ""Fox News Sunday"" about bringing wives into the presidential campaign, Trump continued to blame the Cruz operation for launching the first salvo (in fact, it was an anti-Trump super PAC).

The Trump that has thrown the political system into turmoil and pushed partisan tension to a violent boil is the same one that would be leading the nation, he said.Much like how he has upended the 2016 campaign, he would seek to shake up nearly every aspect of domestic and foreign policy: taxes, trade, military alliances, the economy, nuclear proliferation and foreign relations.While the interview was extensive, Woodward and Costa didn’t press Trump on the violence at rallies, his campaign manager who was charged with battery for an alleged attack on a reporter, his plan to ban all Muslims from entering the country, his controversial stance on abortion, nor his advocacy of birtherism.Speaking with Woodward and Costa, Trump sounded the alarm about the economy, saying that despite indicators of improvement, the U.S. is heading for a ""very massive recession."" His administration would cut taxes, and Trump said that he would eliminate the $19 trillion national debt “over a period of eight years,” which economists say is impossible. ""I’m renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we’re doing so badly on,"" Trump said.Trump also broke an unwritten rule of American political leadership in his interview with Costa and Woodward, saying ""it's a terrible time right now"" to invest in the stock market. A comment like this reminds Wall Street, and Washington, of how inexperienced Trump is with presidential protocol. American presidents (and party leaders) are expected to be vocal, global cheerleaders for American markets, and to use their platform to encourage investors to buy into U.S. companies, stocks and products.Trump went on to reveal that he would have high-level government employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, to keep a lid on what is said about his administration.Without condemning the violence that has followed his campaign events, Trump said that he had been trying to tone it down: ""We’ve purposefully kept the crowds down this past week.""""I bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have,"" Trump confessed, saying that he had been ""nasty"" and ""rough"" in debates. But he maintained he could mend fences and build the coalition needed to govern. ""I've had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they’ve ever met,"" he said. ""And after it’s all over, they end up being my friends.""He cited stories of Muhammad Ali and Vince Lombardi to justify his approach of first winning, then working on gaining the respect of others.As far as alliances abroad, Trump said it was time for the U.S. to reconsider its involvement in international groups, including NATO -- which he called ""obsolete"" -- even in what he accepts will be a world where nuclear weapons are a fact of life.In a video, Woodward, who reported on the Watergate scandal for the Post, said of the interview, ""He was in the mood, 'I wanna answer all your questions.'""Dowd, a New York Times columnist, took a different approach with Trump, holding him to the fire on some of the more incendiary aspects of his campaign, and provoking a rare expression of contrition. Trump admitted that it was a mistake to retweet an unflattering image of the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last month: ""If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t have sent it."" When Trump tried to dismiss the incident by saying he didn’t view the photo ""necessarily as negative,"" Dowd put her foot down, saying, ""It was clearly meant to be nasty.""Trump also agreed that he could have better handled the incident involving his campaign manager allegedly attacking a reporter. ""You’re right,"" Trump told Dowd when she asked him if Corey Lewandowski should have just called former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields and apologized. Dowd went after Trump on the ""draconian"" position he took on abortion this week, asking him if he was ever involved with a woman who underwent the procedure. Trump, formerly pro-abortion rights, declined the question.Dowd asked Trump how he planned to win given his dismal ratings with female voters, possibly as a result of his habit of insulting, demeaning, belittling and stereotyping women. In reply, Trump offered, ""I attack men far more than I attack women,"" and cited different polling showing him doing slightly less terrible with women. He pointed out that he, too, is attacked over his looks, which he characterized as ""phenomenal.""The next big contest for Trump is Tuesday's primary in Wisconsin, where he trails Cruz in the polls.
