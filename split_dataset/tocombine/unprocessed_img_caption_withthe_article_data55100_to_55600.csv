0,BLACK VOICES,Watch Muhammad Ali Explain Why He Feels More Free In Africa Than The U.S.,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muhammad-ali-africa_us_57534e51e4b0ed593f14a767,"The documentary ""Soul Power"" sheds light on Ali's time in Zaire in 1974.",2016-06-04,"Muhammad Ali with his mother, Odessa Grady Clay, in Kinshasa, Zaire ahead of his championship fight in 1974.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57534eed130000fb073839b4.jpeg?cache=QHMt1XAl6U&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Footage of Muhammad Ali from the 2009 documentary ""Soul Power” captures intimate moments when the legendary boxer expressed his pride in Africa while visiting Zaire in 1974.Ali was in Kinshasa, the capital of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, weeks ahead of a heavyweight world championship fight with George Foreman -- an encounter famously nicknamed the ""Rumble in the Jungle.""Foreman was injured and the fight delayed six weeks, but “Zaire '74,” a three-day music festival intended to accompany it, went on as planned -- and Ali attended. The festival brought African-American stars like James Brown, Bill Withers and the Spinners on the same stage with African sensations like Miriam Makeba.In 2009, filmmaker Jeffrey Kusama-Hinte turned hours of previously unseen video of the concert and the days leading up to it into “Soul Power.”Ali, with his trademark charisma and lyricism, had some of the most memorable moments in the film. He shares his appreciation of Africa while connecting his presence there to the broader struggle of black people the world over to achieve justice and freedom.“This is our homeland, this is our civilization,” Ali declares in a passionate speech. “Africa’s the cradle of civilization. Original man’s from Africa. All civilizations started in Africa.”“This fight is for the freedom, justice and equality of the black man in America so that I may take my take my title and my fame and go out there and uplift little black people in the ghettos,” he concludes. “Black people is catching hell. Black people who entertainers won’t speak for.”At another point, Ali seems to appreciate the relatively quiet pace of life in Kinshasa. He mocks Americans who are supposedly afraid to attend the fight or the concert because they worry that Africa is too dangerous.“No kidding, New York is more of a jungle than here,” he quips. He then recites a litany of criminal incidents and scenes of urban chaos. The description is comically over-the-top, but has a realistic ring.“Always something in America,” he finishes. “They’re so peaceful over here. And really, the savages in America.”Ali embraced the music festival as a celebration of shared heritage between black Americans forcibly removed from Africa generations prior and native Africans who remained on the continent. It was, as the promoter Don King put it, “a family gathering, a welcoming back home.”We see Ali on the first day of the festival sitting at a table eating alongside King, Bill Withers and another friend. The camera zooms in on Ali adding spoonful after spoonful of sugar to his coffee.“I’ve never felt so free in my life,” Ali says. “Free from America where I’m not really free.”A young girl from the area goes up to introduce herself while Ali is sitting at the table. Ali just hugs the girl close and kisses her repeatedly as she smiles broadly. The girl does not say anything, presumably since she cannot speak English.(The DRC was a Belgian colony until 1960; French remains one of the official languages.)“She was ruled by the French and I was ruled by the English, so we both done lost our language,” he said. “But one day we are going to talk to each other in our own language.”"

In 2014 he established a Vatican commission intended to set best practices to root out abuse in parishes.With the decree, he puts into action what he promised last year when he approved a Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up or failing to prevent abuse of minors.Victims' groups have repeatedly demanded that the Catholic Church do more to make bishops accountable for abuse in their dioceses, even if they were not directly responsible for it.David Clohessy, director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, remained skeptical about the Church's response.""Instead of just sacking bad bishops, or turning over abuse records to law enforcement, the Vatican is setting up yet another untested, internal church 'process' to purportedly deal with bishops who ignore or conceal child sex crimes,"" he said in a statement. ""A 'process' is helpful only if it's used often enough to deter wrongdoing. We doubt this one will be.""The Roman Catholic Church has been rocked over the past 15 years by scandals over priests who sexually abused children and were transferred from parish to parish instead of being turned over to authorities and being defrocked.In some developed countries, particularly in the United States, the Church has paid tens of millions of dollars in settlements.While a bishop can already lose his job under the existing canonical code for any ""grave reasons"", the Pope said he wanted to specify with the decree that such reasons included instances where bishops fail to tackle abuse cases adequately.Bishops ""must be particularly diligent in protecting those who are the weakest among the people entrusted to them,"" the Pope said in the decree.He said a bishop can be removed from office if he has ""through negligence, executed or omitted acts that caused serious harm to others"", be it physical, moral, spiritual or financial.The decree requires the Vatican to launch an investigation if ""serious evidence"" of negligence is found. The bishop will be given the opportunity to defend himself. Ultimately, the Vatican can issue a decree to remove him or ask him to resign within 15 days.Any removal decision has to be approved by the Pope, who will be assisted by a group of legal advisers.(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak; Editing by Alison Williams/Ruth Pitchford)"

""I would sit on the front porch, look up at the stars and wait for a message.

He became an outspoken member of the controversial Nation of Islam, an African American religious movement that fuses together aspects of traditional teachings that mainstream Muslims follow with the black pride movement. Elijah Muhammad, a Nation of Islam leader, gave Ali the name he would use for the rest of his career. Religion continued to play an important role in the sporting great's life. In 1967, Ali pitted his fighting spirit against the U.S. government by refusing to to serve in the military during the Vietnam War, citing his religious beliefs. He was banned from boxing for three years for this bold stance -- but used that time to speak out against the war on college campuses. Ali parted ways with the Nation of Islam in 1975 and announced he had become a Sunni Muslim.In his later years, Ali served as a diplomat, philanthropist and an advocate for interfaith understanding. Most recently, he publicly criticized presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump about his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Ali called on political leaders to ""bring understanding about the religion of Islam.” His death was announced Friday night. He was 74. In honor of his life and legacy, here are 12 powerful quotes about faith from this extraordinary man."

(He has since attempted to write off the remark as “just a suggestion.”)Ali himself responded to the bigoted ""suggestion"" in a statement.“I am a Muslim and there is nothing Islamic about killing innocent people in Paris, San Bernardino, or anywhere else in the world,” Ali wrote. “True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion.”What's more, BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kacysnki pointed out on Twitter Saturday that -- 16 years ago -- Trump credited Ali with teaching him about tolerance. In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump wrote:Too bad Trump seems to have forgotten what he learned.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Muhammad Ali, Boxing Legend And Anti-War Icon, Dies At 74"

The story of the Bard Prison Initiative (BPI), founded by Kenner in 1999 and supported by his Alma Mater, Bard College, has become legendary. As the largest program of its kind in the United States today, BPI enrolls nearly 300 incarcerated men and women across a full spectrum of academic disciplines, and offers over 60 courses each semester. Kenner's recent awards have included The Chronicle of Philanthropy's 40 Under 40, Richard Cornuelle Award for Social Entrepreneurship, the Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award in Education, and most recently, a Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award (TDIA). The goal of the TDIA is to shine a light on innovations which are helping to solve the world's most intractable problems. Max joins us in The Global Search for Education to talk about how and why BPI graduates are succeeding in the classroom and the real world, as well as his organization's vision for this groundbreaking program looking forward.  ""We don't view our students as incarcerated students that need 'correction'. We approach them with a sense that the whole intellectual world is at their disposal as it would be for any student or any person."" -- Max KennerMax, within five years of their release, more than 3 out of 4 ex-inmates are arrested again. Out of the 300 students who have graduated Bard, only 4 percent have returned to prison. Why are your graduates more likely to succeed?We resist any one explanation of why that happens. Also, it's important to point out we work very hard to press back against the inclination that is shared by leaders in philanthropy, government, and education, that the best metric for measuring the success of our students and alumni is recidivism rates because it frames our work overwhelmingly in the context of criminal justice in a way that reduces our students to simply the people that have been incarcerated for a criminal offense.We measure success of our students in many more ways than whether they return to prison. We treat our students exactly as we would treat any conventional student on the campus of a superb liberal arts college. We don't view our students as incarcerated students that need 'correction'. We approach them with a sense that the whole intellectual world is at their disposal as it would be for any student or any person. We work very hard not to limit the way we approach them or the way they pursue a new sense of curiosity and ownership about the arts, books, ideas, science, mathematics, or a foreign language. It's about their individual pursuits and not about their involvement with criminal justice. They are simply students who should be treated with the same sense of individuality, purpose, and curiosity as any students anywhere. So a better metric than recidivism rates might be something like academic success or other things that are much harder to measure, like how fulfilled a person is over the course of their life, how they engage with questions relevant to their academic study later in life, or the way they speak to their children about their own school work.How large is the well of untapped intellectual potential in prisons today? That's a very fair question and the truth is that we don't know. All we know is that as our project has grown across the country, we continue to find more untapped talent, rather than less.The population that makes up our student body does not show any predictive mechanism for seeing who is more or less likely to succeed in college study. Our students go from mathematical illiteracy to first, or second, or third term calculus and become math majors. Students fall in love with continental philosophy and learn German to read Hegel in the original. These students do not necessarily come from backgrounds where their parents had a superb education. In fact, they often dropped out of school early. Nothing about their criminal history, where they grew up, their institutional record, or their proximity to release are indicators of whether or not the student will be successful in school. ""Typically, our student body goes back to the community from which they came--generally the most isolated, underserved areas in New York--working with populations that needs them the most."" -- Max KennerThe job marketplace is currently very competitive for all young people. Are employers able to remove the stigma associated with incarcerated individuals? Do they believe your graduates have the skills to contribute to their communities?   Amongst our alumni, there are students who are thriving at graduate schools and receiving degrees in social work, public health, PhDs in academic disciplines, urban planning, etc. They study at schools across the CUNY system, Columbia, NYU, Yale, etc. We have students who are vice-presidents in the management of billion dollar international companies. But typically, our student body goes back to the community from which they came--generally the most isolated, underserved areas in New York--working with populations that needs them the most. They serve people with HIV/AIDS, who are homeless, who are returning from prison, and--most of all--youth at risk. Our students are an extraordinary asset to these communities and are recognized as such by employers within them. They have an unusual combination of life-experience and academic training. They are of extraordinary value to people who are hiring in human service agencies.What do you envision for the future of education in prisons? Where is the potential for scaling up this initiative? What are the major roadblocks?We have the Consortium for Liberal Arts in Prison which has worked to establish different programs which are run by other superb colleges and universities across the country. We are currently in twelve states. The first project we helped establish was in Connecticut at Wesleyan University. We have worked with Grinnell College in Iowa, Goucher College in Maryland, Holy Cross College and the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, Washington University in St. Louis, and several colleges in Washington state. One of the reasons we decided not to insert the Bard program into states we don't know is that we feel strongly this work is most successful at a genuinely human scale. All the pressure from philanthropy, government, and money say 'go to scale.' We think our students benefit in the way that they do from an academic education for precisely the opposite reason. We're interested in getting elite colleges and universities to reimagine the way they do their jobs, to reimagine the way that they relate to the communities around them, reimagine the way they can interfere with the worst social problems we face collectively as a country. In the academy--leaders, college presidents, trustees, the elite professoriate--there is a terrible crisis of confidence regarding the relevance of what we do in the humanities and especially in the arts. If we're going to be successful in facing any of the great challenges we are presented with as a country, we must have confidence in one another, and deliver rigorous and ambitious education to all pockets of society where we're told by elites that failure is the most likely outcome. The success of BPI students is evidence that impossibly good results are achievable if we can treat students with dignity. ""All the pressure from philanthropy, government, and money say 'go to scale.' We think our students benefit in the way that they do from an academic education for precisely the opposite reason."" -- Max KennerDo you think that the education of incarcerated individuals has the potential to fundamentally change the institution of higher education in America?The radical success of incarcerated Americans in college education is symbolic. It should move leaders in education to rethink the way we look at college admission and rethink the way we present the things we say we value: civic engagement, historical knowledge, mathematical literacy, honoring the arts, access to science. We need to revitalize the way we share these things with the public at large.What does being a Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards honoree mean to you?It's an honor for the institution to be recognized by Tribeca and for the work begin to be recognized in this way. There is one thing I would like to emphasize with respect to being 'disruptive': if you were to present the success of our students to experts in the social sciences they would argue these results are impossible. But these students do well; and they do it year in and year out. The impossible success of incarcerated students should disrupt the way we have habituated ourselves to look at other problems. We're going to have to address great crises globally in the 21st century--catastrophic climate change, mass extinction, nuclear proliferation, income inequality. Our students' impossible success came from addressing problems from a different perspective and I hope it inspires something similar in all different realms.(All photos are courtesy of BPI and CMRubinWorld)For More Information.

Amongst our alumni, there are students who are thriving at graduate schools and receiving degrees in social work, public health, PhDs in academic disciplines, urban planning, etc. They study at schools across the CUNY system, Columbia, NYU, Yale, etc. We have students who are vice-presidents in the management of billion dollar international companies. But typically, our student body goes back to the community from which they came--generally the most isolated, underserved areas in New York--working with populations that needs them the most. They serve people with HIV/AIDS, who are homeless, who are returning from prison, and--most of all--youth at risk. Our students are an extraordinary asset to these communities and are recognized as such by employers within them. They have an unusual combination of life-experience and academic training. They are of extraordinary value to people who are hiring in human service agencies.What do you envision for the future of education in prisons? Where is the potential for scaling up this initiative? What are the major roadblocks?We have the Consortium for Liberal Arts in Prison which has worked to establish different programs which are run by other superb colleges and universities across the country. We are currently in twelve states. The first project we helped establish was in Connecticut at Wesleyan University. We have worked with Grinnell College in Iowa, Goucher College in Maryland, Holy Cross College and the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, Washington University in St. Louis, and several colleges in Washington state. One of the reasons we decided not to insert the Bard program into states we don't know is that we feel strongly this work is most successful at a genuinely human scale. All the pressure from philanthropy, government, and money say 'go to scale.' We think our students benefit in the way that they do from an academic education for precisely the opposite reason. We're interested in getting elite colleges and universities to reimagine the way they do their jobs, to reimagine the way that they relate to the communities around them, reimagine the way they can interfere with the worst social problems we face collectively as a country. In the academy--leaders, college presidents, trustees, the elite professoriate--there is a terrible crisis of confidence regarding the relevance of what we do in the humanities and especially in the arts. If we're going to be successful in facing any of the great challenges we are presented with as a country, we must have confidence in one another, and deliver rigorous and ambitious education to all pockets of society where we're told by elites that failure is the most likely outcome. The success of BPI students is evidence that impossibly good results are achievable if we can treat students with dignity. ""All the pressure from philanthropy, government, and money say 'go to scale.' We think our students benefit in the way that they do from an academic education for precisely the opposite reason."" -- Max KennerDo you think that the education of incarcerated individuals has the potential to fundamentally change the institution of higher education in America?The radical success of incarcerated Americans in college education is symbolic. It should move leaders in education to rethink the way we look at college admission and rethink the way we present the things we say we value: civic engagement, historical knowledge, mathematical literacy, honoring the arts, access to science. We need to revitalize the way we share these things with the public at large.What does being a Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards honoree mean to you?It's an honor for the institution to be recognized by Tribeca and for the work begin to be recognized in this way. There is one thing I would like to emphasize with respect to being 'disruptive': if you were to present the success of our students to experts in the social sciences they would argue these results are impossible. But these students do well; and they do it year in and year out. The impossible success of incarcerated students should disrupt the way we have habituated ourselves to look at other problems. We're going to have to address great crises globally in the 21st century--catastrophic climate change, mass extinction, nuclear proliferation, income inequality. Our students' impossible success came from addressing problems from a different perspective and I hope it inspires something similar in all different realms.(All photos are courtesy of BPI and CMRubinWorld)For More Information.

Between deep slow drags of his cigarette, he speaks with calm conviction: ""Now my war is to dissolve all religious groups in the State and to destroy the political role of religion."" Once a close friend and personal adviser to Osama bin Laden, his vehement secularism is shocking. Gharaibeh's journey through political Islam offers a window of insight into the strength and preeminence of Islamism, and the longstanding challenges to the development of secular political thought leadership in Jordan, and the region. Gharaibeh grew up finding comfort for his early existential ponderings in Muslim Brotherhood (MB) ideology. He accessed a sense of purpose in Quranic studies, fasting and worship. Particularly in weak states, the Brotherhood operates extensively in the social sphere. His colleague, Manar Rachwani, who has never considered himself part of a religious group, admitted that he too used to participate in social activities, mainly football, organized by the MB and their corollaries: ""This is very important, because it tells you how Islamists attract young men in a very smart way."" After the Iranian and Afghan Revolutions, in the late 70s and early 80s, Gharaibeh travelled to meet his university peer and close friend, Osama bin Laden, in Afghanistan to undertake what they called the ""Islamic Project"". While he is quick to note he disagreed politically with bin Laden, he nonetheless defends his personal character - a dissonance which left him feeling unable to write critically about bin Laden for fear of betraying their friendship. In this crucial historical moment, he joined the Brotherhood's 'Institute of Policy Studies'. They aimed to ""prepare for an Islamic state"" and flexed the Brotherhood's intellectual muscle, developing extensive public policy on all sectors, from education, agriculture, and economics, to elections. Yet, the key underlying pursuit was to understand the compatibility of Islam and democracy, and the role of Islam in state-building. In 1989 Jordan shook with the April Uprisings, after which political parties were legalized for the first time since 1953. With existing resources and experienced leaders (including Gharaibeh) flooding in, there was no real competition: by the next elections in 1991, the Brotherhood's political wing, the Islamic Action Front, won the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Outsiders may look to political openings, and despond the absence of Arab secularists. In many post-Arab Spring countries, secularists emerged disorganized and lacking leadership, while Islamists - often MB offshoots - proved resilient and triumphant in the power vacuum. Similar to the pre-April Uprising conditions, Islamist groups, unlike secular political organizations, were able to develop under most oppressive regimes and political bans, navigating as religious institutions, while incubating political thought leadership. For Gharaibeh, the question of Islam and democracy become clear as the Brotherhood debated boycotting the elections: their arguments for electoral participation contradicted their supposedly religiously ordained power. He published an article calling for the dissolution of religious political parties, and split from the Brotherhood.From the '91 elections onward, Jordanian electoral law has been hotly contested and infamous for stifling political parties. Jordanians have struggled, and even died dissenting against the Monarchy, and for many, the fear of retribution is a sufficient deterrent.It may seem bizarre given the oppression of secular thought leadership and organization, there is not more of an outcry and motivation for dissent -- but few are as hell-bent on reform and secularization as Gharaibeh. Rachwani stressed a gratitude for 'relative' freedom in Jordan. He is all too familiar with Jordan's more oppressive neighbors, having fled Syria in the 1982 Hamma massacre. Now he serves as the managing editor for the opinion section of Al Ghad newspaper, unperturbed by his role to monitor and censor content. ""I am so lucky to be in Jordan. Relatively, at least, it's an open society...we know exactly where the red lines [are]."" This sense has a pacifying effect on an increasingly apathetic Jordanian society, who, given recent affairs and the region's history, seem happy to settle for relative freedom.Jordanians also resist greater pluralism for its implication on tribal power - deeply structurally entrenched within the state. For example, the 2011-2012 Hirak movement witnessed the emergence of many new (albeit short-lived) political parties, including the Political Gathering of the Bani Hassan Tribes. Fellow Bani Hassan tribesmen repressed the group, physically attacking Gathering participants for their dissent against tribal authority. Most tribesmen continue to vote for their tribes, who in some cases have pre-arranged to alternate between entering in Municipal versus Parliamentary elections, so as to not compete with each other. Even if political thought were highly developed, and leadership prepared, attempting secular reform requires not only dissent against the regime but also against tribal society.The sustained grip of Islamist ideology comes at an increasing cost. Jordanian youth seeking the same sense of community and structure Gharaibeh did some fifty years ago, may now find it in more radicalized schools of thought. After his early years observing MB-offshoot Takfir wa Hijra, Gharaibeh suggests a concerning ideological proximity, between Brotherhood and violent extremists: ""There is no difference between Daesh and Islamist groups here (in Jordan). They [Daesh] are just bolder... Daesh is the graduation of Brotherhood from thought to action."" The lack of secular political thought in the region should not be a surprise. It took the Western world more than a century, during the Age of Enlightenment, to promote secularism -- an issue that is not always as settled as we would like to think. It will take more than Arab Spring pro-democracy banners for secular thought leadership to develop, and for bona-fide political parties to emerge, let alone successfully compete with Islamists. Challenging the current state, Islamists, and the authority of sheikhs requires a deeper, broader philosophical movement -- one that cannot be rushed, forced, or imported -- but rather must develop organically, garner popular support, and be ready to indefinitely sustain its efforts.Lily Lousada is based in Amman, Jordan where she works on conflict mitigation, socio-political stability, and governance development.

NASA has mostly had experience with engineers and scientists. We've chosen to reach out to places like [the Center of Theological Inquiry] CTI where your philosophy is to bring interdisciplinary groups together to talk about these very important questions. We tend to try to go to the best."" -- Mary Voytek, NASA Astrobiology Program Director  (Click Here to Listen: Voytek podcast with CTI Director) ""Astrobiology doesn't exist, what are its laws?"" -- Jerry Fodor At a meeting last May in New York with Andrew Pohorille, NASA's senior-most scientist on origins of life, Pohorille told me that there is a certain factor to life that so far cannot be captured in the lab, i.e., life is not purely a technical matter, and that he does not expect ""we"" will find life anywhere else in the solar system, including Mars -- he added that there is as yet no consensus on what life is. But what Andrew Pohorille did not tell me at the time was that just a few days prior to our meeting, NASA's Astrobiology Program -- headed by Mary Voytek -- awarded $1.108M (5% of its annual budget) to the Center of Theological Inquiry, a religious think tank with more than $23M in assets, to investigate how the world's religions might respond to the discovery of life on other planets. John Templeton Foundation is co-sponsoring the two-year project (2015-2017) with a $1.7M grant to CTI.The attempt by Templeton to insinuate its divine motive into science is aided by the failure of science to understand the origin and evolution of life. Templeton funds many projects in these two areas seemingly not to find answers but to factor in religion. Templeton's science and religion director Paul Wason has refused my request for an interview to discuss these matters.CTI is a Princeton-based nonprofit corporation that does advanced theological research. It was spun out of, and continues to work in close association with, Princeton Theological Seminary -- America's largest Presbyterian seminary. CTI's academic advisory panel and board of trustees are mostly Christian scholars and/or advocates (a couple of trustees are also wealth management professionals). Ganesh followers are not principal investigators in the NASA-JTF project as far as I can tell. . . Each of the 24 research fellows participating in CTI's astrobiology inquiry is being paid $70K a year from the joint award to CTI. The 2016-2017 team will soon take up the challenge following the investigations of the 2015-2016 team. The first of the 2016-2017 team to announce his NASA/JTF/CTI astrobiology fellowship online that I've noticed is Jesus College's Rev. Dr. Tim Jenkins, Assistant Director of Research in the Study of Religion.To give a sense of the moving ground, following a February 2016 astrobiology symposium at CTI that Frank Rosenzweig, principal investigator for NASA Astrobiology's University of Montana team, and another NAI astrobiologist participated in -- NASA's online newsletter reported this:""Both [NAI] scholars are interested in learning about the origins of life by replicating evolutionary processes in the laboratory. Rosenzweig has undertaken research that seeks to study the process of evolution in such a way that history and contingency are controlled. In this way we can learn about not only what happened in the past but also what could have happened, but didn't. That helps us know more about what might be possible elsewhere in the universe.""More of NASA's astrobiology strategy for the next decade can be found in its latest roadmap: Astrobiology Strategy 2015. Lindsay Hays of California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is editor-in-chief. Microbes are given some attention in a section titled: ""How Does Our Ignorance About Microbial Life on Earth Hinder Our Understanding of the Limits to Life?"" Curiously, however, there's not a word in the entire 256-page document (including the glossary) about the existence of viruses -- the biggest part of the biosphere -- let alone their consortial and persistent nature, when the new thinking in science is ""virus first"" and that persistence may be just as crucial to life as replication.Templeton last year also awarded $5.4 M for origin of life investigations to the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution, with funds being administered by FAME synthetic biologist Steve Benner (who once quipped, ""If you don't have a theory of life, you can't find aliens -- unless they shoot you in the leg with a ray gun."") AND $5.6M to ELSI -- the Japanese government's earth science institute in Tokyo - for its ELSI Origins Network, headed by astrophysicist Piet Hut also of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.Steve Benner is listed as a reviewer on NASA's latest roadmap and is on the editorial board of Astrobiology Journal whose senior editors include NAI's new chief Penny Boston as well as ISSOL (International Society for the Study of Origin of Life) president Dave Deamer.   Astrobiology Journal is put together in the Kennewick, Washington home of Sherry Cady, a geologist who serves as editor in chief, and her husband Lawrence P. Cady, a fiction writer who serves as the journal's managing editor and copy editor -- according to LP Cady. The magazine is one of 80 of Mary Ann Liebert Inc.'s ""authoritative"" journals and has close ties to other NASA-funded scientists who serve as reviewers. If anything substantive is likely to happen as a result of (or in spite of) Templeton funding on origin of life, I would expect it to come from Steve Benner's project, which includes people like George E. Fox who collaborated early on with Carl Woese on Archaea, and Harry Lonsdale origin of life research funds recipient, Niles Lehman -- plus Benner himself and eight others.On the other hand, I have serious reservations about the NASA award of $1.1M of public funds to CTI. What ever happened to the separation of church and state?One of the 2015-2016 CTI recipients of NASA-Templeton funds is Lucas Mix, an Episcopalian priest who belongs to an organization called the Society of Ordained Scientists. He is also a member of CTI.   LUCAS MIX  Mix was editor-in-chief of Astrobiology Journal's 2006: Astrobiology Primer, an 81-page insert in the journal that referred to natural selection as the prime mover of evolution (Sherry & Lawrence Cady were the journal's editor and managing editor at the time.).  Mix is also a lead author of NASA's Astrobiology Strategy 2015 contributing a section in which he states: ""The results of astrobiology research will have broad societal impact, affecting the way we think about life in the context of ethics, law, philosophy, theology, and a host of other issues."" I refer to Lucas Mix in my conversation with UCLA paleontologist Bruce Runnegar -- who was NAI chief at the time Mix's Astrobiology Primer got underway -- in my book The Altenberg 16: An Exposé of the Evolution Industry. I asked Bruce Runnegar about the Primer NAI supported on his watch:""Suzan Mazur: The explanation for natural selection being promoted as the sole mechanism of evolution in that publication -- the decision about that would have been whose?To put this all in further context, following are excerpts of my February 2008 conversation with current CTI/NASA/Templeton investigator Lucas Mix: LUCAS MIXLucas Mix: The Primer came together over a six-year period. The first four years of that I was a student in biology at Harvard. The last two years of that I was a seminarian.Suzan Mazur: This was a publication that was supported by NASA, although it's not an official publication of NASA. Do you know what the extent of funding was from NASA?Lucas Mix: Well, I proposed the Primer to the NASA Astrobiology Institute as a way of promoting interdisciplinary education and as a joint activity of graduate students in astrobiology for their education and networking and career development. . . . I would say 2002, 2003 that NASA Astrobiology Institute became officially interested.Suzan Mazur: There were 70 contributors, 10 editors. Were people paid to do this?Lucas Mix: No. I was the only one who was paid and I was paid for a small amount of travel and to go to a couple of conferences and to do the editing and contacting people.Suzan Mazur: How long did it take you to put the publication together?Lucas Mix: The idea came about 2000. It appeared in print in November 2006. . . . Astrobiology Journal is put out by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. . . . It's a peer reviewed journal and the Primer appears as an article in that journal.Suzan Mazur: The big question is, regarding the discussion of evolution in the Primer, what's cited is that one of the features of life is ""progressive adaptation via Darwinian evolution."" But there's no mention of any other approach to evolution aside from Darwinian selection. With all the breaking news about alternative evolutionary approaches, why wasn't there any room for alternatives?Lucas Mix: To start with, it's important to recognize that the Primer is an attempt in 81 pages to summarize the background information of all of astrobiology and that what happened was that we solicited input as to what needed to be in the document and then we tried to edit draconianly short descriptions of topics. So the evolution section really is meant to give only the most introductory of remarks about evolution.Suzan Mazur: But it was introduced in a dogmatic way regarding Darwin. I mean, this is it. This is the way it is.Lucas Mix: That was not my impression.Suzan Mazur: But nothing else was offered.Lucas Mix: A great deal of work was done to ensure that it talked about neutral selection.Suzan Mazur: There was nothing about self-organization, for instance, in your Primer.Lucas Mix: Well, there are certain areas in the Primer that were not as full as they could have been. And one of the benefits of doing another version of the Primer, an online version of the Primer, as I hope occurs -- is that some of those gaps will be filled in. I can't say without sitting down with it and the writers what exactly I feel should or should not have been in that section. But definitely overall I'm happy to say that there are things we left out.Suzan Mazur: Is that information going in another version?Lucas Mix: Well, I think that would have to be a discussion between whoever the editors are and whoever the author of that section is. Evolution is not an uncontroversial topic, at least in terms of how it's presented and what you see is the result of a year's worth of writing and researching and editing. So I wouldn't wish to comment on what another year's worth of writing, researching and editing might bring.Suzan Mazur: Are you still involved with the project?Lucas Mix: At present there is not officially any project. It is quite possible that Mary Ann Liebert will release updates or a second version of the Primer at some point in the future. We talked about it. It's probably not something that will happen in the next 12 months. . . .Suzan Mazur: You're an Episcopalian minister now. I spoke to Reverend Dan Conklin the other day and he said yours was an emerging congregation.Lucas Mix: Yes.Suzan Mazur: Meaning that you don't have a space yet or it's an experimental type of church?Lucas Mix: Experimental is a very good way to describe it. The ""emerging church"" is a movement that recognizes some of the long-time practices and doctrines of the church should be revisioned and because it is emerging, it is to some extent experimental, the direction which they will emerge and what will emerge is not fully determined.Suzan Mazur: Did you participate yesterday? Did they have the Darwin on Sunday at Epiphany parish?Lucas Mix: I preached at Epiphany Parish.Suzan Mazur: Rev. Conklin mentioned that you've had this program four years in a row. He said that the discussion does get thrown open to things like various challenges to Darwinian natural selection. Did you noticed any of that? Did that happen yesterday? Was there any dissent? . . . .Lucas Mix: Not too much. I would come back to the difference between positive selection and neutral selection. I don't think that Darwin had the concept of modern statistics that is so essential to the way evolutionary theory is conceived of these days. So I'm very uncomfortable saying that I'm in the school of Darwin and I do think the questions of probability and the word random that gets used in a number of ways are very much issues today in the popular conception of evolution.Suzan Mazur: One of the reasons why self-organization was excluded from the Primer was not because of any religious affiliation that you might have?Lucas Mix: By no means. The Primer should have no religious content. I certainly hope that it does not. I can't guarantee that nothing has snuck in, but. . .Suzan Mazur: You're still doing the martial arts?Lucas Mix: Yes. I work with Enso Center for International Arts. That's a family business. And I should probably mention that I am currently working on a book for Harvard Press called the Astrobiological World, which will be a much more accessible entrance into the world of astrobiology and will contain information about the interaction of religion and science.Suzan Mazur: And when is your book coming out?Lucas Mix: My expectation is February or March 2009. . . .Religion has nothing to do with science and the NASA Astrobiology Program has squandered precious public funds -- 5% of its annual budget -- for an investigation into how the world's religions might respond to the discovery of life on other planets. It has handed over $1.108M to a religious think tank, a nonprofit corporation with wealth management professionals on its board that already has in excess of $23M in assets. It is money that could be spent productively on authentic journalism to more effectively expose the politics that drives world disasters, including the use of group mind control, religious and otherwise."

And when I heard that my mind instantly raced back to 1968. Muhammad Ali by then had become America's official and biggest pariah. His conversion to the Nation of Islam, his one-time friendship with Malcolm X, his outspoken black preachments, all capped by his refusal to be inducted and his outspoken stance against the Vietnam War, made him a marked man. A federal grand jury in Houston quickly indicted him, and an all-white jury convicted him. He was slapped with the maximum punishment of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. His passport was revoked. The FBI stepped up its effort to ruin him. In one of its many wiretaps on Martin Luther King Jr. in 1967, it noted that Ali had proposed to donate the proceeds from a boxing match to King's organization. But the match could not be held, since every state boxing commission in the country had, by then, revoked Ali's license. Still, the FBI was alert for any hint that Ali might try to dodge legal restrictions on him to earn money in the ring. J. Edgar Hoover, the notorious head of the FBI at the time, assigned agents to watch and record everything that Ali said whenever he appeared on Johnny Carson's ""The Tonight Show."" FBI agents also distributed ""anti-violent statements"" to counter what the bureau called ""the anti-Vietnam stand of Cassius Clay."" The FBI's spy-and-intimidation operation against Ali was finally exposed in legal documents in his draft case in 1970. By then Ali had embarked on the speaking circuit talking to anti-war and student groups on various campuses. One of his stops was at California State University, Los Angeles, my alma mater. Ali arrived on campus followed by a small swarm of FBI agents. Wherever Ali went, FBI agents tracked his every move. This didn't matter to me. In fact, it added to his allure. I, and a small entourage of Black Student Union members, met him in the parking lot to serve as his ""official"" escorts to the auditorium. Ali was the paragon of cheer and graciousness, and was as always playful. He shook everyone's hand and engaged in light hearted banter with the students. In his talk, he stuck to his stock themes, leading a chant, ""No Vietcong ever called me a nigger,"" punctuated by digs at the Johnson administration and his denunciation of racial oppression. During his speech, the FBI took notes and snapped pictures of those in the crowd.However, what really brought the house down, was his shout to the standing room only crowd that despite everything the government did to him, he still was the biggest, baddest and prettiest, and yes the greatest. As he departed to loud cheers and shouts of encouragement, I, and a few others, thrust our draft cards in front of him, and he eagerly signed mine and the others. To this day his signature on my draft card is one of my most precious and endearing keepsakes.In the next two decades, the unthinkable happened. Ali was no longer America's fallen and disgraced boxing champion, he was now officially rehabilitated, even exulted, as an American global ambassador of sport and even of political goodwill. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terror attack, a Hollywood group loosely known as Hollywood 9/11 that worked with the Bush administration to support the war on terrorism promoted happy images of American life to film audiences in Africa and the Middle East. And who did they choose to be their star pitchman, you guessed it, Ali. During the next decade, the honors continued to flow to him. Presidents, heads of state, and foreign dignitaries, all hailed him as an authentic American hero and icon. But Ali's struggle with Parkinson's Disease had clearly taken its toll. Yet the rare times he appeared in public, I noted that he still had that same ingratiating smile he greeted me with those years earlier. And he would snap out an occasional playful jab to swooning and adoring admirers. Despite everything, Ali was and would always be mine and the world's ""peoples champ"" and yes, the greatest.

The hands can't hit what the eyes can't see."" -Muhammad Ali, 1964Legends never die. Especially ones that were born with wings. From its inception, the monarch butterfly generally takes about four weeks to get its wings. From the day Muhammad Ali was born on January 17, 1942, until the day he made his transition on June 3, 2016, he floated. And while ""The Greatest"" is no longer with us in his physical form, the legacy that he left will forever live on. Ali was truly a polarizing figure. Some people felt that he was arrogant, pompous and self-absorbed. His in-your-face approach rubbed those folks-- Black and White--the wrong way. But in the midst of a Jim Crow America, Ali possessed unwavering anti-establishment beliefs that broke down the barriers of oppression. From his refusal to fight in the Vietnam War, to his conversion into The Nation of Islam--and subsequently changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali-- to his charismatic way of implementing humor into bold truths, everything about Ali said I'm Black and I'm Proud. Ali refused to be confined. In fact, the only time in his public life when he was constricted was in 1984, when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Even still, Louisville's native son kept his will to win by making appearances and raising awareness for the incurable neurological disease. ""The People's Champ'"" fought 61 bouts in his career, but his final loss was on Friday, after battling respiratory problems.While there'll never be another Ali, he certainly inspired generations of independent thinkers. Soon after winning the world heavyweight championship in 1964 from Sonny Liston, Ali told the media:""I don't have to be who you want me to be; I'm free to be who I want.""Muhammad Ali is now free. Free from any physical pain and constrictions. Free from racial barriers. Free to float to the highest heights of heaven. It's been said that the monarch butterfly can fly as high up as 11,000 feet. But for a man who knew no boundaries here on earth, I don't think he'll ever stop floating."

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb817a02600003500837aff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump's attack on Judge Gonzalo Curiel is despicable. Saying that someone has an ""inherent conflict of interest"" because of their heritage is pretty much a textbook example of racism. It seems like any semblance of a fig leaf that Trump's rhetoric is about immigration and his wall rather than animus toward an entire community of 55 million has been blown away.  For the record, Judge Gonzalo Curiel was a member of La Raza Lawyers Association, a respected network of local bar associations of Latino lawyers and judges in California. We are the National Council of La Raza, a different group and the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States.   There are in fact hundreds if not thousands of organizations, media outlets, and associations that use ""La Raza."" There is nothing nefarious about the use of this term. It simply refers to the Hispanic people and it is a nod to our common heritage. But apparently that heritage is the reason Donald Trump believes he cannot get a fair shake from Judge Curiel. It brings back awful memories of more than a few people saying that Thurgood Marshall should not have been the first African-American Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court because of his long and storied involvement in the civil rights movement.  Judicial ethics prevent Judge Curiel from responding to personal attacks against him, but evidence of his qualifications, integrity, courage, and patriotism is extensive. As has been widely documented, Judge Curiel is a U.S. citizen and a former federal prosecutor who brought drug cartel kingpins to justice, refusing to back down even when faced with death threats. In 2006, he was appointed by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to a judgeship in San Diego. Judge Curiel was nominated to the federal district court in 2011 and confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 2012.   And any concern that politics have impacted his actions here should be dispelled by the fact that he has presided over the Trump University case since 2013, well before there was any hint that any of the parties involved might become a political candidate. In truth, he postponed the trial until after the presidential election expressly to prevent it from having an effect on the presidential campaign.  All this is evidence that shows how bigoted and ridiculous Trump's railings against Curiel are and the judge deserves an apology. The bottom line: It is deeply offensive that anyone would cite someone's ethnicity as the basis to question or disparage their qualifications. It is even more disturbing when that behavior comes from those who seek to represent our country."

That's so uncool!"" but my uncle said, ""Sure!"" and my sister and me instantly switched to, ""I wanna be in the picture! I wanna be in the picture!"" About ten of us stood in front of my uncle's home, lined up like the staff of Downton Abbey. Finally, a van pulled up and a half-dozen middle-aged black dudes with out of style Afros lumbered out, each with blue baseball caps with ALI on the cap in gold, and admiral-styled golden ""fried eggs"" on the brim. As my dad and uncle chit-chatted with his entourage, Ali slipped out of the van and wandered around the property, not talking to anyone. We'd all heard his slurred speech on TV and this odd behavior was starting to break my heart. I was just watching the entourage, thinking about how sad it was that Ali wasn't the man he used to be, off wandering somewhere far behind me. A fly, or maybe a mosquito was buzzing my right ear. I kept swatting it away, kept thinking about Ali. Gradually I noticed that his entourage was laughing at me. Then I turned around.  For I don't know how long, Muhammad Ali had been no more than an inch behind me and only me, rubbing his fingers by my ear making an insect sound. Then he put up his dukes.I nearly burst into tears. The most famous man in the world, my absolute hero of heroes, was pretending to box me! Feebly I raised my fists and everyone howled with laughter. Rest in peace, champ.

Muhammad Ali was a Boxer, Philanthropist, Activist, Husband, and a father.  Pictured here is Muhammad Ali aka Cassisus Clay January 17,1942, Cassisus Marcellus Clay was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He came into the world with a gift that later took the sport of boxing to a whole different level. At the age of 12 Ali realized he was created to be a fighter after his bike was stolen. Ali had reportedly told a police officer by the name, Joe Martin that he wanted to beat the person that had ran off with his bicycle. The Officer told Ali that he needed to learn how to fight before challenging someone.Not only was Joe Martin a police officer, but he taught young men the sport of boxing. Martin soon began training Ali the sport and he fell in love. Ali competed in his first Amateur fight in 1954 which he won by split decision and later in 1956 he won the Golden Glove Tournament for novices in the light heavyweight class. In 1960, Ali became an Olympic gold medalist and 4yrs. later after winning the fight against Sonny Liston he was given the title heavyweight boxing champion of the world. Ali was passionate about the sport of boxing and after his title defense against Zora Folley on March 22, he was stripped of his title for refusing to be drafted to do service in the United States Military.  Pictured here is Muhammad Ali and Sonny ListonAli's boxing license was suspended by the state of New York and he was convicted of draft evasion on June 20th. He was then convicted and sentenced to 5yrs. in prison and fined $10.000.00. Later, Ali came back with fire and reclaimed his title two more times in the 1970's as he won against Joe Frazier and George Forman. Many around the world were captivated by Ali's words and confidence in the ring. Though the media loved his antics, but didn't like his chances in the ring. His all time favorite quote ""I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."" has been repeated in films and by his fans all over the world.  Pictured here is Muhammad Ali and Joe FrazierWho could ever forget the legendary fight that took place October 2, 1980 against Ali and Larry Holmes, it was that fight that took Holmes to victory. In 1981, Ali retired from the ring with a record of 56 and 5. In 1984, at the age of 42, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. After his diagnoses he didn't stop making public appearances and he brought awareness to the disease and continued as a philanthropist. In 2005, Ali was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Muhammad Ali had a heart of gold and was the most clever and amazing fighter of all time. He never doubted his abilities in or outside of the ring. He was truly the greatest. Pictured here is Muhammad and his Wife Yolonda Williams photo by Kwaku Alston ""I am the Greatest.

The native of India was convinced that Klug had stolen software he had developed, according to police, who called Sarkar's claim unfounded.So far no motive has emerged to explain why he killed Hasti in the home they had shared in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, some 2,000 miles (3,200 km) away from Los Angeles.Police only decided to check on Hasti after finding a note at the Los Angeles crime scene written by Sarkar, 38, asking authorities to check on his cat at his home in St. Paul.Hasti had been dead for some time when they discovered her, police said.The bizarre hint led to the discovery of a ""kill list"" that included Klug, Hasti and the second professor, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters on Thursday.Alex Hasti on her Facebook post offered no indication of what might have provoked Sarkar.""My sister, Ashley Hasti, was the smartest, coolest, and funniest person I knew. She could do anything she dreamed of,"" the sister said. ""Unfortunately, she won't get to see that last dream come true as her life was cut short much too soon by her estranged husband ... I'm still in a state of shock right now.""Sarkar was armed with twin 9mm semiautomatic pistols and multiple extra clips of ammunition, authorities said. The shooting drew a massive response of heavily armed police. Students hid in classrooms behind doors, some of which did not lock, according to social media posts.It was just the latest in a long string of deadly shootings at U.S. schools, including an October attack at an Oregon community college that killed nine and a 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, in which a gunman killed 32 people, was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.PAIR WED IN 2011Ashley Hasti married Sarkar in 2011, according to a copy of a marriage license obtained by Reuters. An active Facebook page belonging to Hasti shows pictures of Sarkar, none more recent than May 2011.A page apparently belonging to Sarkar, with no public posts since 2011, prominently displayed several photos of them together.Sarkar came from India's eastern state of West Bengal, where he graduated from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur in 2000 after studying aerospace engineering, according to an ex-classmate and the university's alumni list.Staff at his secondary school in the industrial town of Durgapur remembered him as an able student who passed his exams with good results.""My initial reaction was one of shock and disbelief,"" said Gautam Biswas, who taught Sarkar in the 9th and 10th grades at St. Michael's School in Durgapur, West Bengal. ""How could he do this? That was the question that racked my mind for long hours.""(Reporting by Nichola Groom; Additional reporting by Amy Tennery in New York, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Sujoy Dhar in Kolkata; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Jeffrey Benkoe)"
21,GREEN,What Needs To Happen For The U.S. To Ditch Fossil Fuels,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/100-percent-renewables-us_us_574ef995e4b02912b24156e7,It's time to catch up to Europe.,2016-06-03,Falling prices and generous tax credits have dramatically increased solar energy use in the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574f0b8e130000d6053833f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to renewable energy, the U.S. has some catching up to do. For four days last month, Portugal generated all its electricity from renewable sources. Days earlier, Germany powered its electrical grid with renewables for 24 hours. Denmark did the same in 2015, and Sweden hopes to get there soon. Overall, Europe has the capacity to draw nearly half its power from renewables.The U.S. currently gets about 7 percent of its electricity from renewables (not including hydroelectric sources), though that number varies widely from state to state. Only a handful of cities around the country have managed to hit 100 percent renewable power.But the U.S. is indeed working to swell its reserves of energy from sources like solar and wind. The country was one of the top producers of clean energy in 2015. It also invested heavily in renewable technology last year and supports tax incentives for clean power projects. Thanks in part to federal support, the number of clean energy projects has spiked in recent years.Powering the entire country on clean energy, however, will require lawmakers to encourage investments in a more interconnected grid and in cheaper ways to store power, as well as to expand tax credits for renewable energy production, experts say. “It’s important to recognize that if we’re going to get on this pathway, it’s not going to happen without deliberate choices and policies along the way,” Rachel Cleetus, senior economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Huffington Post. “That’s really critical.”One challenge is that the sprawling U.S. electrical grid isn’t as interconnected as the European system, according to Cleetus. The U.S. grid is made up of three smaller grids -- on the east coast, in the west and in Texas -- linked by few points of connection. The European grid, on the other hand, connects countries across the continent, allowing nations to easily trade power with their neighbors. To achieve a more interconnected grid, the U.S. would need to invest more in long-distance, high-transmissions power lines that can ship renewably sourced electricity from areas where it’s abundant to places where it’s harder to come by, according to Cleetus. In the meantime, Cleetus added, lawmakers should encourage battery manufacturers to develop cheaper ways to store wind and solar power. Existing battery technologies tend to be used mostly in small-scale, niche renewable projects, often because they're too expensive to use in bigger systems, according to Paul Denholm, a senior analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Low-cost batteries might allow renewable energy producers to store power on a large scale, he said. Rapidly scaling up renewable energy production will also require lawmakers to expand clean power mandates and tax credits for renewable energy production, according to Cleetus.Some federal and state tax incentives for renewables already exist, like the Production Tax Credit, which essentially pays companies for every unit of electricity they generate from renewable sources. In addition, 29 states have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which require them to get a certain share of their electricity from renewables.""In states that have renewable portfolio standards, they have been instrumental in driving the ramp up of renewable energy,"" Cleetus said.But renewable energy use could plateau without added federal support. To expand renewable use nationwide, Cleetus added, ""we need these policies that encourage greater deployment -- whether its renewable portfolio standards or the expansion of the production tax credit.""For inspiration, lawmakers don’t have to look to Europe. States like Texas and Colorado routinely meet large portions of their electricity needs with renewable energy, and California has pledged to get 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. All three states have ambitious renewable portfolio standards and a wide range of tax incentives for clean energy. “These subnational examples give a sense of where country as a whole can go,” Cleetus said. “Everywhere in the country there are renewable resources. Seeing these examples and seeing replications around the country will lead the way.”Promoting policies that encourage renewable energy use nationwide are key, since the U.S. already has much of the technology needed to roll out renewable energy on a large scale.Using existing technology, the U.S. could achieve 80 percent renewable energy by 2050, according to the NREL. Further improvements in power storage and grid infrastructure could boost that percentage even higher, according Denholm.“In terms of raw tech, we’re mostly there,” Denholm told HuffPost.Whenever scientists have run into snags, Denholm said, “good engineering practices have identified these potential showstoppers and demonstrated that they’re solvable.""“Every time we find something bad we’ve been able to find a solution,"" he added."

Then he made a decision that changed everything: He would take Friday as a ""free day"" and not work.Brian Scudamore, who is chief executive and founder of home services company O2E Brands, also decided to designate Mondays as ""think days,"" when he works from home and takes no meetings. But taking off on Friday was the most important thing he did, Scudamore writes in the article. ""[Fridays are] days where I do what I love -- skiing with my children, cooking, learning languages and biking,"" the 40-year-old says. ""When I’m away from the office, things have time to marinate. Connections bubble up and often turn into big, business-changing ideas.""Scudamore's company encourages employees to set their own schedule, too, O2E brand publicist Sarah Gray told The Huffington Post. ""We can pick our own schedule -- come in when we want and leave when we want. It's not a culture of 'clock watchers,' "" Gray said in an email. ""We're more about setting/achieving our goals than we are about hammering home a 9-5 workweek.""There's loads of research out there that demonstrates that working longer hours is bad for your health. Working more means that there's less time to exercise, de-stress and sleep, among other things. And that causes real, physical damage. Those who work more than 55 hours per week have an increased risk of stroke compared to those who work less than 40 hours, according to a major analysis of studies that NYMag.com's Science of Us blog cites.""Overwork and the resulting stress can lead to all sorts of health problems, including impaired sleep, depression, heavy drinking, diabetes, impaired memory, and heart disease,"" said Sarah Green Carmichael in Harvard Business Review last year.Long hours are particularly hard on the health of lower-income workers, research shows. They already have more stress just coping with the anxiety of making ends meet and are even more vulnerable to the health risks that overwork brings on.Overworked, unhealthy employees also cost companies more to insure, are absent more often and their work isn't that hot either.Though your boss may think that working longer hours is a sign you're working super-hard and productively, the truth is managers don't often haven't a clue about who is really productive. You can't judge someone's performance by how frequently they're spotted at their desk.The higher-ups at one consulting firm had no idea that some of their best workers were only pretending to put in 80-hour workweeks, according to a widely cited study from Erin Reid, a professor at Boston University's business school.Scudamore says that taking Fridays off has helped him think more creatively. Anyone who's ever had an amazing idea while in the shower or just taking a walk can surely relate to this. And it's not just knowledge workers who see benefits from working less. A century ago, Henry Ford cut worker shifts in his automobile plant to eight hours from nine (and doubled their pay) -- and business boomed. Some companies are already on board with the notion of a shorter week. Basecamp, a Chicago-based software company, does four-day work weeks in the summer. A design firm in Indiana is only open Monday through Thursday because its founder believes his workers are more motivated, according to a piece in CNN Money. The article says that about 14 percent of small companies offer employees a chance to work a compressed four-day week.If you're at a company who hasn't yet seen the light, feel free to send a link to this piece to your boss. Good luck. (Yes, I wrote this on a Friday, but I do plan to leave early. Baby steps.)"
23,SPORTS,Ken Starr Interview Gets Really Awkward When A Certain Baylor Email Comes Up,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ken-starr-interview_us_5751cb47e4b0eb20fa0dd053,It's hard to watch someone change their mind -- twice -- about how to answer a simple question.,2016-06-03,Ken Starr at a Baylor University football game in 2015. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5751f074160000ab02f954f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A local news interview with Ken Starr took an awkward turn when the ex-Baylor University president was confronted with a potentially incriminating email that prompted his crisis manager to hurriedly intervene -- after which Starr gave two more answers, both different from his first response, to the original question. Starr on Wednesday resigned as chancellor of Baylor University. The school's board of regents had removed him as president just a few days earlier as part of the ongoing fallout from revelations the school turned a blind eye to claims Baylor football players were raping female students.He announced his resignation during a Wednesday interview with ESPN's ""Outside The Lines,"" in which he also insisted he had been operating behind a ""veil of ignorance"" about the football rape scandal.Later that day in an interview with Texas station KWTX, Starr was confronted with a 2015 email from a Baylor student who personally wrote to Starr and stated in the subject line she had been raped at Baylor. Starr did not give a clear answer as to whether he read the message. “I honestly may have. I’m not denying that I saw it,” he said at first. That's when, off camera, Starr's longtime friend Merrie Spaeth -- a crisis manager and former PR flack in the Reagan administration -- tried to shut the interview down.KTWX later said Spaeth told the station not to use the interrupted portion of the interview. When the news director refused, Spaeth pulled Starr away to convene before he returned on camera. Given a second chance to explain whether he'd seen the email, Starr said, “All I’m going to say is I honestly have no recollection of that.”Starr then looked at Spaeth and said, ""Is that OK?""Given a third chance to answer the question, Starr went for full denial. “I honestly have no recollection of seeing such an email and I believe that I would remember seeing such an email,"" he said. ""The president of a university gets lots of emails. I don’t even see a lot of the emails that come into the office of the president. I have no recollection. None!”Starr flatly denied he was sitting on any incriminating information.Starr has called his resignation ""a matter of conscience"" and said he stepped down so that he could talk openly -- something he couldn't do as a top Baylor official. ""I am calling on the board of regents for transparency,"" Starr said. The former Baylor student who wrote the email to Starr copied other Baylor officials, including football coach Art Briles, who the board suspended ""with intent to terminate"" over his role in the scandal.The woman, only identified as ""Sarah"" to protect her privacy, said in a Wednesday interview with ESPN that neither Starr nor anyone from the athletic department reached out to her after she reported her alleged rape.Sarah criticized Starr for later characterizing the scandal as an issue of ""interpersonal violence."" ""Let's call it what it is: it's sexual assault,"" Sarah said. ""It downgrades what we've been through. I find it a little offensive."" "

Probes",Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-university-investigations_us_5751a6efe4b0eb20fa0dae66,Reports suggest campaign contributions or other backroom dealings may have played a role.,2016-06-03,Donald Trump is not so fond of the attorney general going after him in New York. His tune is slightly different in Texas and Florida.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5751ad5b1200002500895504.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has made headlines lately for his investigation of Trump University, the for-profit real estate course over which presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is now facing several lawsuits.On Thursday, Schneiderman piled on, describing the now-defunct Trump U. as an instance of ""straight-up fraud,"" even as Trump himself basked in the publicity and touted his plans to reopen the business if he wins the White House.Recent reports from Florida and Texas add a new dimension to Trump U.’s troubles: At least two attorneys general, in Texas and Florida, knew about and planned similar investigations into the program’s dealings but then mysteriously dropped the probes. The more extensive report comes from the Houston Chronicle, which describes how in 2010, the office of then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) had decided to prosecute Trump University for false advertising.One lawyer who worked closely in the investigation called the probe into Trump U. ""an extremely strong case,"" and records show that everything was set for a lawsuit unless the business agreed to a $5.4 million settlement with the state.But then... nothing happened. The office dropped the case. And curiously, Trump donated $35,000 to Abbott's bid for the governorship in 2013, as reported by The Associated Press. (Coincidentally or not, that's how much the ""elite"" Trump U. seminar package cost.)A spokesman for Abbott, now the governor of Texas, told the Chronicle that there was no relationship between the probe and the later campaign cash, and that Abbott acted in Texans' best interest by pushing Trump U. out of the state. David Morales, a former deputy to Abbott when Abbott was attorney general, told the Chronicle on Friday that Abbott was not involved in his own office's decision not to sue Trump U.Abbott endorsed Trump for president last month.The other report, from the Orlando Sentinel, may be more egregious because it suggests the Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, agreed in 2013 to give up her own probe of Trump Institute -- a local affiliate of Trump U. -- after the businessman made a $25,000 donation to her re-election bid.Bondi actually knew about Schneiderman's lawsuit in New York and briefly considered joining it, promising to look into similar allegations from Floridians who said they'd been scammed. But three days later, a political action committee that supported Bondi received a check from Trump, and then nothing came of the investigation.Pressed by the Sentinel about the Trump donation and about why she didn't look into the complaints, Bondi didn't respond. But when Trump was asked in 2013 why he donated to Bondi's re-election campaign, the reality star didn't mince words: ""Pam Bondi is a fabulous representative of the people -- Florida is lucky to have her.""In the same statement, Trump also had a few words for Schneiderman, who is a Democrat: ""The case in New York is pure politics brought by an incompetent attorney general, a political hack.""Bondi's office did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
25,IMPACT,Urban Garden Aims To Bridge Gap Between 'Old' And 'New' Harlem,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyrp-urban-garden-harlem-marcus-samuelsson_us_5751cd30e4b0ed593f144fbe,"""Anyone who cares about this community wants to make sure the identity there remains strong.”",2016-06-03,"Marcus Samuelsson attends Harlem EatUp!, an annual food festival he founded to showcase the vibrant food and culture of the neighborhood.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5751d951130000d6053838b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This urban garden initiative seeks to bring in a little cash and a large sense of community to some Harlem residents.A new partnership announced on Wednesday between celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson and nonprofit New York Restoration Project (NYRP) will allow two community gardens in East Harlem to grow and sell vegetables to one of Samuelsson’s local restaurants, Streetbird. All proceeds from the sales will go entirely to the gardeners, most of whom are low-income residents of East Harlem. “It will build stronger links in Harlem between the people who will grow things in the gardens and the vibrant local economy,” NYRP Executive Director Deborah Marton told Huffington Post. “Maybe someone will make the jump and get a job there, who knows -- but we’re excited about the possibilities.”The two community gardens -- owned by NYRP but entirely operated by local residents -- will start growing seasonal fruits and vegetables this summer, based on requests from the Streetbird chef. The Marcus Samuelsson Group will pay them the same price for the produce that it normally does to commercial purveyors.The goal of the project is less about making money for local residents and more about strengthening community ties, according to Marton.“The project will provide some revenue, but not a huge amount of money,” Marton said. ""The main motive was making sure the new Harlem and the old Harlem are connected.""By the new Harlem, she means the people and businesses that have been ushered in by gentrification:“Harlem has changed in the past 10-20 years: Real estate has gotten more expensive, different people are moving into the neighborhood,” Marton said. ""But Harlem is the cultural heart of the U.S. African-American community -- and as such, anyone who cares about this community wants to make sure the identity there remains strong.”As gentrification radically alters many low-income areas in New York City, including Harlem, the concern is that the influx of wealthier residents not only pushes out long-time lower-income residents, but also dissolves important parts of local culture that have been built over generations.“This is about making sure all boats get lifted at once,” Marton said. ""And that the connection to our history can be protected.”Marcus Samuelsson was an ideal partner for this initiative, according to Marton, because of his efforts to cultivate strong ties to the Harlem community where his restaurants, Streetbird and Red Rooster, operate.Last year, he started an annual food festival, Harlem EatUp!, to showcase the vibrant food and culture of the neighborhood. The festival proceeds went to Citymeals on Wheels and Harlem Park to Park. ""Marcus has clearly put a stake in the ground with Harlem EatUp!, as well as his hiring practices, employing 200 people, many of whom are from the neighborhood,"" Marton said. ""He’s invested in maintaining the identity of Harlem, the authenticity, the regard for all economic levels -- like we are.""This is the first partnership between an NYRP community garden and a restaurant, and it's one of only a handful of similar partnerships in New York City, according to Marton.NYRP still doesn’t know how much produce the two gardens will be able to grow and how much revenue they will generate, but if the project goes well, the goal is to bring it to others among the 52 community gardens they have across East Harlem, the South Bronx and Central Brooklyn.“We see the role of these gardens as making sure the low-income residents of New York City enjoy access to quality, open, clean, safe, beautiful spaces -- in the same measure as communities of wealth do,” Marton said."
26,POLITICS,Journalist Wants To Slap Some Sense Into Reporters Covering Donald Trump,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bob-garfield-donald-trump_us_5750b6f3e4b0c3752dcd288d,"""On the Media"" radio host Bob Garfield says the press is failing to convey the national emergency of Trump's ascendancy.",2016-06-03,"Bob Garfield and Brooke Gladstone, co-hosts of WNYC's ""On the Media.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's normal for Bob Garfield to critique the press — he does it every week as co-host of public radio program ""On the Media.""But now, he's upping the ante exponentially, delivering strong rebukes to reporters over the airwaves and in a column for losing sight of Donald Trump's intrinsic flaws as the presumptive Republican nominee. You know -- that pattern of xenophobia, racism and misogyny that should have put Trump's candidacy on life support months ago, according to Garfield. ""It’s about slapping a somnolent media into realizing that the stakes are extremely high,"" Garfield said this week. ""It's a rare moment in American history where someone so fundamentally anti-democracy is in position to vie for the presidency.""Comments like that show how Garfield, at least on the subject of Trump, has leaped from press criticism to advocacy, or ""agitation,"" as he called it. Trump's list of pros and cons tips heavily toward the negative in Garfield's eyes. That's why's he's so upset that the media have largely stopped challenging Trump's divisive, hateful record while instead engaging him about his tax returns and possible picks for vice president. To Garfield, Trump's ascendancy represents a national emergency, and journalists are asleep at the switch. ""Why has there been no media crusade to deny him the presidency? The press jumps to warn America about missing children, tainted meat and approaching dustings of snow?"" Garfield wrote this week in Mediapost. ""Why are we not on high fucking alert?""But hasn't the press already shown that Trump would attack freedom of religion by banning Muslims, that he has called for killing civilians related to terrorists, that he's said ""the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and Hispanics,"" that he waffled on whether to accept support from a white supremacist, among other positions and statements that would have hurt nearly any other human being looking for political support in this diverse country?Not nearly enough, according to Garfield. The potency of crucial facts about Trump's statements has been weakly delivered, he said. They're drops in a shower that includes coverage of The Donald's hair and the whereabouts of his campaign plane. Even coverage of Trump's policy speeches is trifling to Garfield.Instead, Garfield wants a laser-beam blast from the press focused on what makes Trump unfit to occupy the Oval Office. Everything else is insignificant.In a country that expects objectivity from the press, and often confuses objectivity with neutrality, Garfield's unabashed directness might be unpalatable. Contrast Garfield's exhortations with the soothing voices that tend to dominate public radio and he becomes even more of an outlier. He knows it. ""I'm taking a big personal risk,"" Garfield said. ""I'm going beyond the personal comfort zone of journalists in the United States.""Cable news must fill 24 hours a day with content, and news websites are hungry for continuous updates, making it easy for journalists to offer up empty calories when they should be serving healthy meals. Kelly McBride, of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, (who was an early critic of Trump) said Garfield is making a rational, if animated, plea for editors and news directors to look at what they're feeding the public. ""I'm not sure he’s telling journalists to change their standards of reporting. He’s saying, 'There’s a maniac and you’re acting like it’s normal. Use the old standards,'"" McBride said.Newsroom playbooks for covering Trump vary greatly. The Huffington Post includes an editor's note reminding readers of Trump's worst characteristics in every story about him. The Wall Street Journal editor in chief told underlings last month to be ""fair"" to the reality TV star, according to Politico. National Public Radio, meanwhile, had to clarify longtime commentator Cokie Roberts' role after she wrote an anti-Trump column.WNYC, which produces ""On the Media,"" says that its journalists must maintain their credibility with the public and not damage New York public radio's standing as an impartial news sources, according to a spokeswoman. ""As co- host of 'On the Media,' Bob's job is not to report the news, but to be smart and dogged about how the media covers the news,"" said Jim Schachter, WNYC's vice president of news. ""He has staked out a provocative position intended to make people in the media, and consumers of media, think hard about the proper role of journalists in an unconventional moment.""Garfield's wake-up call to colleagues ""is probably too late,"" according to Ed Wasserman, dean of the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism. That's because news outlets -- cable news in particular -- bought into the hoopla around Trump over the summer.""They put him on because he drew a crowd and their audience numbers spiked,"" said Wasserman. ""But at the same time, they conferred stature and credibility on his candidacy that I and other people think he didn’t deserve.""Some outlets are taking a more aggressive tack toward Trump. CNN on Thursday found a new way to point out an untrue claim from Trump, while The New York Times ran a headline Friday saying that Trump ""could threaten U.S. rule of law.""That's a start. But if Garfield had his way, the media would treat Trump as if he were Vladimir Putin or another foreign despot. ""Why is there a different standard for domestic bad guys?"" Garfield asked.This article has been updated to include comments from WNYC.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. "

Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger, who was denied entry to a Trump election night event in March, was ejected Thursday night by a Trump campaign staffer and a private security guard, according to his publication. The Trump campaign denied Schreckinger press credentials for the event, so he attended the rally with the public by obtaining a general admission ticket. The Trump campaign has periodically denied press credentials to numerous outlets this election cycle, presumably because they published critical or unflattering stories. Politico has been part of this apparent media blacklist, which also included BuzzFeed, Mother Jones, The Daily Beast, National Review, Univision, Fusion, The Des Moines Register and The Huffington Post.“Once again the Trump campaign has refused to allow a Politico journalist to cover a campaign event, this time physically ejecting our reporter from a rally as he typed on his laptop,"" Politico editor Susan Glasser said in a statement.""If this is an effort to squelch independent coverage of their campaign, it will not work,"" she continued. ""Such actions constitute a violation of the basic right of a free press to report and as such the Trump campaign has a responsibility to let journalists do their job."" Even outlets whose reporters aren't barred from events have faced hostility from the campaign. A New York Times reporter was ejected from a January stop at a pizza restaurant after he published an article critical of the campaign's Iowa organizing efforts. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbed then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields as she tried asking Trump a question at a March election night event. (Fields is now reporting on the election for HuffPost).News outlets who have been denied press credentials, like The Huffington Post, or journalists wishing to report at Trump events outside of the designated ""press pen,"" have in the past used general admission tickets to cover them.Reporters generally seek a press credential to avoid waiting -- possibly for hours -- to enter an event with the public, and to have space and wireless internet access to be able to file stories on deadline. TV networks especially need the time to set up equipment, and the space to have a clear shot of the candidate on stage. But getting press access also means dealing with the campaign's restrictions on journalists' movements. In the Trump campaign case, these have resulted in threats when journalists tried to leave the ""press pen"" to cover newsworthy moments off stage.Schreckinger was covering Trump's event outside the press section when stopped by a campaign staffer, according to Politico's account. A campaign staffer spotted the reporter typing on a laptop outside of the press pen at the San Jose Convention Center and asked the reporter, who was attending on a general admission ticket, if he had press credentials. The Trump campaign has refused to credential the reporter for multiple events.Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told Politico the campaign wasn't aware of the incident and was “looking into it.”Hicks did not immediately respond Friday to HuffPost's request for comment. Carla Marinucci, a California-based reporter for Politico, also described on Twitter how she was also approached by Trump campaign staffer in the general admission section. The staffer suggested the reporter was there to ""disrupt"" it. Schreckinger's removal comes two days after a raucous news conference in which Trump blasted reporters for asking him legitimate questions about veterans donations -- questions the press had been seeking answers to for months. Trump said such contentious dealings with the press would continue if he's elected president. Legal scholars on Friday told the The New York Times that Trump's attacks on the press, along with criticism of the judicial system and views on presidential power, ""collectively sketch out a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

Their progress -- and their expenses -- were monitored the three years before and after.Initially, costs spent on homeless services, such as medical care and public benefits, significantly increased, but that was mostly due to their deteriorating health and the fact that they hadn’t sought out care in recent years. Once they settled into their housing and programming, those expenses declined by $31.5 million, or 56 percent, from 2011 to 2015.For example, jail costs dropped dramatically.In that same period, jail costs went from $1.6 million to $580,000, a 64 percent decline.There were also significant declines in costs related to public benefits, homeless services and emergency room visits, among other costs.Such shifts translated into this population looking toward federal and state programs, rather than just the city’s resources.Instead of waiting for a health emergency to strike, these individuals were better equipped to seek out routine healthcare visits. Those are often covered by federal and state sources, in addition to the City’s General Fund.They were also more likely to take advantage of CalFresh, a program that helps low-income individuals and families buy food and Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid welfare program.The report was released at a time when city officials are divided over how to address the city’s growing homeless problem, and when numerous reports have come out in favor of housing first, which pushes giving homeless people housing and then addressing their health and unemployment issues.On a single night last year, there were 6,686 homeless people in the city, up from 6,436 in 2013, according to the annual point-in-time survey. Overall, the city’s expenditure on services for homeless people analyzed in the study increased. That was due to the fact that the city was serving more people, who were seeking out more services, the report noted.But the efficacy of housing first still stands, according to the authors of the study.Since homeless people often “consume the lion’s share of dedicated resources,” taxpayers are slated to save millions if homeless people’s needs are met.“Our takeaway was that overall the city is going to incur costs, but it was a better form of costs,"" Severin Campbell, who helped write the report, told The San Francisco Chronicle, ""and what people were getting was a better form of care.""Visit DoSomething.org to find out what you can do to help homeless people."
