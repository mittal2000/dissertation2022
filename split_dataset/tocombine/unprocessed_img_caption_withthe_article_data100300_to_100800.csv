Rodriguez/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb49804200000e800007e21.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been an interesting year for films and as a Writers Guild member I see a lot of them, but I don't review too many. As a matter of fact, the last one I recommended was Boyhood  way back in June, a month before it opened, and I'm delighted to say my thoughts proved prescient of what was to come as it remains one of the favorites to win the best picture Oscar.Another movie which will no doubt be on the same list is A Most Violent Year, a film that just came out, and despite its title it is not nearly so violent as it sounds. It doesn't come close to what you might be used to in a, let's say, Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino film, yet it is extremely absorbing and I urge one and all to see it.First off, it's more of an anti-gangster film, in that, while talk of the mob is pervasive, our principal character, Abel Morales, played by the very gifted Oscar Isaac, recently seen in Inside Llewyn Davis, prefers to skirt around the lawless community, even as his wife Anna, played by an earthy, tough-minded Jessica Chastain grew up in their midst.And what also makes it different is the setting of the feature, written and directed by J.C. Chandor, which takes place, not in the more typically illegal pursuits such as racketeering, drugs, prostitution and gambling, but in the more mundane world of those who disseminate heating oil. Who knew that heating oil might occupy the sphere of would-be Capones, but indeed it is with respect to territorial issues and cajoling customers from one enterprise to another.Morales' problem, without giving too much away, is intertwined between his desire to expand by buying a parcel of land owned by a family of Hasidic Jews who also flirt with the mob and are apparently not in the diamond business on New York's 47th Street while he is also beleaguered by forces who are hijacking his oil trucks and stealing his product.In the course of events, he is aided by his attorney Andrew Walsh, sleazily played by an excellent Albert Brooks, who ferries back and forth between Lawrence, a prosecutor determined to make an example of Morales, earnestly portrayed by Selma's David Oyelowo and bankers who appear willing to loan Morales enough money to buy the land he needs.As the pressure mounts, our hero strives to remain true to his desire to make his way in life without unduly dirtying his hands, all the while struggling to stay legit. His wife, however, would like him to use her illicit family connections, and he is beset by various problems throughout that make the offer all too tempting. That's what makes the plot riveting and often surprising.There are traces of The Godfather's young Michael Corleone, who tries to steer clear of his family's business at first, but ultimately becomes a Mafioso kingpin, and the film keeps us guessing as to the path Morales ultimately chooses and whether he will succeed or it will be his undoing.That's all I'll say, except that there's a lot of action, some car chases, but not too much and some interesting New York City landscapes, but not too many with which you're probably too familiar.It's a film that came upon us at the end of the year, but with word of mouth and lots of significant award nominations, including a recent win as Best Picture by the National Board of Review, it will probably attain the audience it deserves in the months ahead.Michael Russnow's website is www.ramproductionsinternational.com"

Martin took to Instagram on Sunday to send out pics of #heaven after a YouTube video claimed to show images from an auto wreck in which the 43-year-old Grammy-winning singer was supposedly killed. If there is a heaven, it's not unreasonable to expect that it might look something like this. However, the Washington Post reports that the beach image may be from Culebra, Puerto Rico rather than any otherworldly shores. Martin later sent out a second image from his #heaven: The video claiming Martin had died was obviously a hoax. It said the report came from the sheriff's department in Marin County, north of San Francisco, but that the singer had died on a freeway in Los Angeles some 400 miles away. In addition, the supposed video of the wreck is from another country, with cars bearing a different type of license plate and driving on the opposite side of the road. However, some fans fell for the hoax and took to social media to express their anguish and share the video. Martin shot to fame as a member of Puerto Rican boy band Menudo in the 1980s and then as a groundbreaking solo artist with crossover hits such as ""Livin' la Vida Loca"" and ""Shake Your Bon-Bon."" His newest album, ""A Quien Quiere Escuchar,"" will be released next month."
2,BLACK VOICES,Judge Agrees To Consider Releasing Eric Garner Grand Jury Records,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-garner-grand-jury-records-staten-island_n_6418622.html,,2015-01-05,"Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner, speaks during a rally at the National Action Network headquarters, Saturday, July 26, 2014, in New York. Eric Garner, 43, died on Thursday, July 18, during an arrest in Staten Island, when a plain-clothes police officer placed him in what appeared be a choke hold while several others brought him to the ground and struggled to place him in handcuffs. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0496200000e800ff2ef7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- A New York judge said on Monday that he will hear arguments later this month over whether to unseal the grand jury proceedings that resulted in the decision not to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner.The New York Civil Liberties Union, the Legal Aid Society, the office of New York City Public Advocate Letitia James and The New York Post have all petitioned for the records to be released. At a short hearing at the New York State Supreme Court in Staten Island on Monday, Judge William Garnett told attorneys for those groups to prepare oral arguments for a hearing on Jan. 29. Garnett also asked the office of Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan Jr. to prepare arguments against the release of the records. Donovan, who is opposed to the release, came under fire last month after the grand jury, which he convened, declined to indict New York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo for Garner’s death. Garner, 43, died on July 17 after Pantaleo put him into a chokehold during an arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes. The incident was caught on a video, which eventually went viral, showing Garner screaming “I can’t breathe” numerous times before his body went limp. Grand jury proceedings are typically sealed -- meaning the public often never sees what evidence was presented to the grand jury -- unless a petitioner can prove that the release of the documents serves a compelling public interest. The groups advocating for the unsealing of the Garner proceedings believe that the release would improve the ongoing national debate about grand juries in light of recent police violence.“What is particularly compelling in this case is that we’re engaged in a public conversation about grand jury proceedings and about police behavior,” Arthur Eisenberg, the NYCLU's legal director, told reporters after Monday’s hearing. “The disclosure of the grand jury minutes allows that conversation to be more informed and that, we think, under the circumstances of this case, is a compelling interest.” Donna Lieberman, executive director of the NYCLU, added that the public debate surrounding Garner’s death is “so legitimately intense because the stakes are so high, the public has a right to know.” “Sure, there are some matters that should legitimately be kept secret,” Lieberman continued, “but the lion’s share of what went on in that grand jury room needs to be made public. What is our future policy regarding grand juries? Should they exist, should they function in secret or should they be open? That’s what this case is about.""If ever there was an application that involved compelling interest and the people’s right to know and lifting the veil of secrecy, this is it,"" Lieberman added.Matthew Brinckerhoff, the attorney representing Public Advocate Letitia James, said that release of the records would help public officials like his client “evaluate potential reform measures,” such as the appointment of special prosecutors in cases against the police. Many have called for special prosecutors in these instances, arguing that district attorneys have an inherent conflict of interest when prosecuting police because they work so closely with police on other cases. Brinckerhoff noted that there are precedents in New York courts for the release of grand jury records. “There are Court of Appeals cases -- the highest court in New York -- where grand jury minutes have been released to public officials,” he said. Among those in the courtroom Monday was Gwen Carr, Garner’s mother, who wore a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words “I can’t breathe.” “I would like transparency, to see what actually happened,” she told reporters outside the courthouse, where a few dozen protesters had gathered during the hearing. Carr was joined by Cynthia Davis of the National Action Network, who announced that the Garner family will hold protests outside the courthouse every Tuesday and Thursday until Judge Garnett decides on the case. Donovan’s office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment. Donovan -- who may soon announce a run for Congress to replace disgraced Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) -- last month released only an extremely limited set of details surrounding the grand jury proceedings. The information Donovan provided was as follows: Sixty exhibits were admitted into evidence to the grand jury, which met for nine weeks and heard from a total of 50 witnesses. The jurors were also instructed in the law regarding the use of force by police officers.These details are sparse compared to the complete set of documents that has been made public regarding the grand jury decision about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The release of those documents in November raised serious questions about how St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch conducted those proceedings, which resulted in a decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for Brown's death. One of the grand jurors in the case is now suing McCulloch, accusing him of mischaracterizing the case against Wilson. Monday’s hearing in New York was originally scheduled for last month, but was delayed after the judge in the case recused himself, citing a conflict of interest.  "

Yesilkoy already has a Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Catholic church.The construction project will be funded by the Syriac community. The Syriac Orthodox Church is considered to be one of the oldest Christian denominations. Part of the church’s liturgy is said in an ancient Aramaic dialect believed to be closely related to the language spoken by Christ. Syrian Orthodox churches can be found all over the world. There are now only 25,000 Syrian Christians in Turkey, according to The Daily Sabah. Turkey is officially a secular country, but about 99 percent of its 76 million residents are Muslims. Less than 100,000 are Christian.The country’s Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the country’s religious leaders on Friday. He insisted that the ruling AKP party “does not discriminate between our citizens” and that “the principle of equal citizenship continues to be our characteristic trait.""Turkey has in fact become a refuge for Christians fleeing persecution by the Islamic State in nearby Syria and Iraq, Reuters reports.But secular critics of the AKP have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of trying to strengthen Islam’s influence -- particularly through changes to religious education in schools.

Peters is pro-choice, supports Obamacare, a raise in the minimum wage, and is the only one who has voted for the Equal Rights Amendment for women.And the rest? You be the judge.In a time when the majority of those needing food assistance are poor women and their children, 10 of the 12 Republicans signed a pledge right after election day to vote to eliminate food stamps. The two that didn't sign were in races that hadn't been decided yet. So much for compassionate conservatism.One hundred percent of incoming senate freshmen want to repeal Obamacare. That means insurance companies could go back to charging women more for the exact same coverage men get. Women would also lose birth control without co-pays, mammograms, and maternity coverage.One hundred percent of the new Republicans are also anti-abortion, though one of the two women (Shelley Moore Caputo of West Virginia) would make exceptions for rape and incest. Several support so-called personhood amendments, elevating the rights of fertilized eggs over the rights of women.When he was governor, Mike Rounds, South Dakota's entry in the freshman class, went a step further and signed a near-total abortion ban which also included prison time for doctors. Voters had to mount a referendum to nullify the decision.

Some of these guys don't even believe we should safeguard women from violence.

After Perdue left, Dollar General paid $19 million to settle the case. And don't count on the two females in the group to look out for their low-wage sisters. Joni Ernst of Iowa says we don't need a federal minimum wage, and Shelly Moore Caputo of West Virginia has repeatedly voted against equal pay bills.There you have it.

With its hostilities, the Obama Justice Department is waging legalistic war on our democratic rights to know substantially more about government actions than official stories. That's why the imminent courtroom clash in the case of ""United States of America v. Jeffrey Alexander Sterling"" is so important.Sterling is accused of telling Risen about a CIA operation that had provided flawed nuclear weapon blueprints to Iran in 2000. The charges are unproven.But no one disputes that Sterling told Senate Intelligence Committee staffers about the CIA action, dubbed Operation Merlin, which Risen's book later exposed and brought to light as dumb and dangerous. While ostensibly aiming to prevent nuclear proliferation, the CIA risked advancing it.When he informed staff of the Senate oversight committee about Operation Merlin, Sterling was going through channels to be a whistleblower. Presumably he knew that doing so would anger the CIA hierarchy. A dozen years later, as the government gears up for a courtroom showdown, it's payback time in the security-state corral.The relentless prosecution of Sterling targets potential whistleblowers with a key implicit message: Do not reveal any ""national security"" secrets that make the U.S. government look seriously incompetent, vicious, mendacious or dangerous. Don't even think about it.With so much at stake, the new petition ""Blowing the Whistle on Government Recklessness Is a Public Service, Not a Crime"" has gained more than 30,000 signers in recent weeks, urging the government to drop all charges against Sterling. The initial sponsors include ExposeFacts, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, the Government Accountability Project, The Nation, The Progressive / Center for Media and Democracy, Reporters Without Borders and RootsAction.org. (A disclaimer: I work for ExposeFacts and RootsAction.)Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg has concisely summarized the context of the government's efforts in the Sterling prosecution. ""Sterling's ordeal comes from a strategy to frighten potential whistleblowers, whether he was the source of this leak or not,"" Ellsberg said in an interview for an article that journalist Marcy Wheeler and I wrote for The Nation. ""The aim is to punish troublemakers with harassment, threats, indictments, years in court and likely prison -- even if they've only gone through official channels to register accusations about their superiors and agency. That is, by the way, a practical warning to would-be whistleblowers who would prefer to 'follow the rules.' But in any case, whoever were the actual sources to the press of information about criminal violations of the Fourth Amendment, in the NSA case, or of reckless incompetence, in the CIA case, they did a great public service.""Such a great public service deserves our praise and active support."

As long as Russia supports the Donbas Deep South -- and that is likely to be for a long time -- Ukraine will be too weak to grant it autonomy or to absorb it.,2015-01-05,"NIKOLAYEVKA, UKRAINE - 2014/07/06: The people waiting for their turn to have goods. The people of Slaviansk get the humanitarian aid from Ukrainian soldiers after the Pro-Russian rebels were kicked-out from Kiev. (Photo by Sergii Kharchenko/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1432d2300005000d0c60e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many journalistic accounts -- as well as the Kremlin's propaganda machine -- depict the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine's separatist Donbas region and the Crimea as an aggrieved ethnic minority clamoring for nothing more than greater autonomy and cultural and language rights. Seen in this light, Kiev and ethnic Ukrainians are the victimizers. The Donbas and its Russians are the victims. To put the conflict in American terms, Kiev is white America and the Russian-speaking regions are black America. The analogy is completely false.For starters, the Crimea has enjoyed the status of an autonomous republic since 1991. The province ran itself, and Kiev rarely meddled, so much so that it even neglected the physical needs and civil and cultural rights of the peninsula's Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians. The two Donbas provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk have also had de facto autonomy from Kiev. Since the 1930s, they've been the bastions of Ukraine's Stalinist Communist Party, which remained highly influential until the revolution and war of 2013-2014. Since 2001, both provinces have been the stronghold of the Party of Regions, which largely drew its functionaries and electorate from the Communists and which served as the springboard for Ukraine's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. Ukraine's richest man, the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov, funded the Party of Regions, which, together with the Communists, ran the Donbas as its fiefdom. Unsurprisingly, both the Crimea and the Donbas witnessed the absolute hegemony of Russian language and culture. School instruction was largely in Russian; the media -- whether books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio -- were also overwhelmingly in Russian. Ethnic Ukrainians frequently complained that, if they tried to use Ukrainian in public, they'd be told to ""speak human"" -- i.e. Russian. Most residents viewed Ukrainian as a ""foreign"" tongue and viewed the hegemony of Russian as a perfectly natural state of affairs. A supremacist minority detested all things Ukrainian. I remember meeting one such supremacist at a conference in Kiev in 1994. He insisted that the rights of Russians were persistently being violated in the Crimea. Were there too many Ukrainian schools?, I asked. No, he answered. Did Ukrainians dominate the media? No. Was he unable to speak Russian in public? No, again. What then was the problem? He finally fessed up: the very fact that Ukrainian existed in the Crimea was an offense. Indeed, I can think of no instance of a Russian speaker being discriminated against in either the Donbas or the Crimea since 1991.A far more appropriate analogy for understanding Russo-Ukrainian relations is the Jim Crow South, with Russians as the whites and Ukrainians as the blacks. Not only have Russians and Russian speakers ruled the Crimea and the Donbas and enjoyed complete language and cultural rights. They have also proven to be the most reactionary, intolerant and illiberal population within Ukraine. During Viktor Yanukovych's four-year reign from 2010 to 2014, Ukraine's Jim Crow South captured Kiev and began extending its norms to all of Ukraine. ""Black"" Ukrainians fought back, first with the Orange Revolution in 2004 and then with the Maidan Revolution of 2013-2014. The slogans of both revolutions centered on human and civil rights, dignity and personal autonomy -- just as during the civil rights movement in the United States. The ""white"" Yanukovych regime fought back -- in the same manner as racist whites in the Deep South -- with violence, intimidation and the equivalent of its Ku Klux Klan, the armed fanatics that eventually formed the core of the separatist armies. Unsurprisingly, ""black"" Ukrainians have divided into a variety of factions. The overwhelming majority supported, and continues to support, moderation, tolerance and inclusion, along the lines of Martin Luther King. Although there is, alas, no equivalent of Dr. King in contemporary Ukrainian politics, most Ukrainian democrats employ his rhetoric and promote his ideals. But there are also ""black"" Ukrainian radicals. The right-wing Svoboda party's leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, has sounded remarkably like Malcom X. The hyper-nationalist Azov Battalion resembles the Black Panthers, and its leader Andrii Biletsky could easily pass for Eldridge Cleaver. The analogy with the Deep South breaks down because of Russia's annexation of the Crimea and its invasion of eastern Ukraine. Russia's presence in these regions ensures that they will remain as reactionary, intolerant and illiberal as they have always been. If Kiev were to reach some political accommodation with the pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas, Ukraine would face an impossible choice. If the Donbas retains the autonomy it has always had, it will remain a Jim Crow bastion that will prevent Ukraine from becoming a liberal democracy. If Ukraine attempts to spread liberal values to the Donbas Deep South, the region's ""white"" elites and Ku Klux Klan will, once again, rebel. Moscow will claim that their rights are being violated by the Ukrainian racists and fascists in Kiev! The United States could eventually overcome Jim Crow laws because Washington was stronger than the Deep South. As long as Russia supports the Donbas Deep South -- and that is likely to be for a long time -- Ukraine will be too weak to grant it autonomy or to absorb it. Faced with such an unenviable choice, Ukraine would be well advised to leave the Donbas to its own devices, borrow from Dr. King's rhetoric and ""dream"" of a sunny future."

Time for the Academy to dust off their bones and realize it.,2015-01-05,"NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 14: General view of atmosphere at The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences Hosts An Official Academy Members Screening Of Birdman on October 14, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images for Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb498022400005000561fab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Antonio Sanchez is undoubtedly one of the world's best drummers. Although most recognized for his work with guitarist Pat Metheny, his fourth album as a leader, Three Times Three, will be released in March. He teaches around the globe, has won four Grammy awards, received damn near every degree in music and has his own signature stick. He's also created the most captivating score of 2014, for Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu's Birdman, and will not even see his name on an Oscar ballot.The Academy Awards, like most accolade-based spectacles, is a glorified popularity contest. Though not as mind-numbing as its musical counterpart, the Oscars are more about who you're wearing than what you've brought to the filmmaking conversation. Hollywood is big business, and to ignore the fact that sitting in the dark with strangers, eating hilariously overpriced candy and staring at a screen isn't a product of numbers followed by many zeros would be misguided. I have to believe there is hope for the underdog, though, because when I was 13, Roberto Begnini's golds were more Olympic medal than Oscar statuette.Mr. Sanchez won't even have the chance to be the underdog due to the Academy's rule stating, ""scores diluted by use of tracked themes or other pre-existing music, diminished in impact by the predominant use of songs, or assembled from the music of more than one composer shall not be eligible."" With a half hour of Sanchez's tenuous drumkit score and 17 minutes of incidental music by Mahler, Tchaikovsky and others, the fulcrum favors the former. The film, a tumbling yet fluid vignette and a commentary on the balance of life and art, rests solidly on the drums. Naked, acoustic drums. Reminiscent of Ry Cooder's stark guitar landscapes, director Iñarritu says, ""the drums for me are the heartbeat of these actors... [they] helped me to get the spine to navigate, to get the flow, to get the rhythm."" The score is in the very DNA of the film, which features drummer Nate Smith on camera in place of Sanchez, who was on tour with Metheny during shooting.While composers have been disqualified in the past due to collaboration, this is a marked aberration in that it is bypassing a non-traditional, even avant garde score. These drums, based on improvisation and re-recorded to sound ""a little dirtier, a little greasier... old and rusty and more organic,"" are quite literally the heartbeat of the film. Most films lack that human quality, that flesh and bloodiness that owes much to the heavy dose of Raymond Carver in the plot and stage management. Iñarritu, best known for his Amores Perros-21 Grams-Babel trilogy, brings these elements to the fore of his films, often focusing on mortality and death. Birdman echoes these themes, but the cinematic mastery on display and the steady crumbling of a few fourth walls adds alternate dimension. A non-innovative score would have felt wrong, especially with the classical pieces that Iñarritu calls, ""in a way, great, but honestly if I would have put another good classical piece it would be the same film.""It's impossible to think that this score is not the subject of melodic prejudice. Drums, of course, have tone -- they're not simply pieces of animal skin stretched over hollow objects that were surely humankind's first instrument and the basis of all music in history, ever. My friend Chris, a Bonham-cast beast of a batteur who has broken more drum heads than I can safely count, was delighted when, as a teenager he showed me that his DW kit had tuning notes stamped inside the shells. I don't think he adhered to them, but if he had they were quickly beaten a few semitones flatter. Regardless of melody, the drumkit is a multi-timbral instrument contained in a (hopefully) tight and functional package, much like Birdman itself with its single-shot and theatrical aesthetics. Rarely does a score have its own identity, yet this one is an indispensable actor in an already tight cast.Antonio Sanchez deserves an Oscar nomination. I know he's got one for the Golden Globes but that's just the Academy's ""ruder, cruder, and boozier cousin."" If Birdman or its actors are nominated for any Oscars, so should its score. There's even a petition for that. If you can side with the Academy, I salute you, but don't blame it on ""jazz"" or that it's ""just drums."" The mechanical facilities necessary for composing and performing the score are on par with anything by Alexandre Desplat or Hans Zimmer, and they best Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who apparently hit the ""Social Network"" button and slept through Gone Girl.The Academy Awards -- sorry, The Oscars (we must rebrand it, we have the technology) -- should celebrate artistry and Hollywood ingenuity. Sure, this year is special because we saw it bend to the whims of a backward island nation (or was it Anonymous, was it Sony itself?!), but let's acknowledge a truly American story here: the work of a multicultural team spinning our obsession with superheroes on its head, questioning identity, realism and the very craft that the Oscars purport to award. Lest we forget, 2011's throwback pastiche The Artist won Best Original Score after leaning heavily on Bernard Hermann's work in Vertigo.Films are evolving thanks to visionary artists -- seems like just yesterday Dorothy was stunned by technicolor. Time for the Academy to dust off their bones and realize it."
10,WORLDPOST,2015 Can Be the Tipping Point for Safe Schools and Children's Education Globally,"Gordon Brown, ContributorFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2015-children-education_b_6414774.html,2014 was a bad year for children and education.,2015-01-05,"LAHORE, PUNJAB, PAKISTAN - 2014/12/23: Pakistani students of Study in School gather in a candlelight vigil for the massacre of the innocent school children at Peshawar school. (Photo by Rana Sajid Hussain/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1432c2400006800382940.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"2014 was a bad year for children and education. My hope is that 2015 will be a tipping point in the other direction. And there is good reason to believe so.Outrage at the massacre of 132 children in Peshawar, Pakistan late last year has sparked a worldwide petition now signed by around 1.17 million people. The Avaaz movement and the A World at School initiative have the support of children's rights activists, with signatures from Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, the two girls who were shot alongside her in the Pakistan bus attack -- Shazia and Kainat -- and political leaders, including a symbolic signing by members of the cabinet of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The idea of safe schools -- and the universal call for every child to have the right to education free of fear and intimidation -- was inaugurated in Nigeria by President Goodluck Jonathan and his finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who found that girls were refusing to go to school out of fear of further terrorist raids following the kidnapping of some 200 girls  from their school in Chibok. So when the government of Nigeria called for international support to fortify schools, it received financial support from international aid agencies and Nigerian businesses, and while this initiative may not ultimately stop the carnage if a terrorist group were to arrive at a school, the deterrent effect is a first line of defense and so, too, is the message to parents that everything possible is being done to make schools safer for their children.The spontaneous display of public anger follows unprecedented terrorist violence against children in 2014. In the space of just a few days, extremists shot and maimed schoolgirls and boys across three countries -- in Pakistan, Yemen and Nigeria. In particular, Dec. 16, when 132 children were shot in a Peshawar school in the worst school atrocity of all time, will go down as a day of infamy. On that same day, 15 girls and boys were also blown to pieces -- killed in a school bus attack in Yemen.And two days earlier, an unknown number of Nigerians were killed and yet another 100 Nigerian women and children were kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram gunmen. It was a raid only 30 miles away from Chibok, where Islamist militants first shocked the world eight months earlier when they abducted more than 200 girls from their school dormitories.The new wave of terrorist violence brought to a tragic end a year when the violation of children's rights has become so commonplace that assaults on children's lives are now barely reported. Schools, which should be safe havens for children, have become theaters of war; schoolchildren have been used as pawns in armed conflicts; and education has become a weapon of terrorists and militias. THE CHILDREN OF CIVIL WARMore so than ever before children have been caught up in civil wars, their schools caught in the crossfire, their education interrupted, some forced into child labor and child trafficking and others forcibly conscripted into child militias. Altogether, 15 million children were 2014's innocent victims of conflicts, stranded in no man's land from Syria and Iraq to South Sudan and the Central African Republic, bringing the number of displaced children around the world to 25 million, now its highest level since World War II. If they were ever brought together in one place, their number would equal the population of a medium sized state. And many of them are already the forgotten children of the world -- with no country to call their own, trapped in camps with not even the hope of completing their education. The best forecast is that most of them will spend all their school age years growing into adulthood out of their home country.For nearly 70 years, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been a pointed reminder of the world's responsibility to protect every child. For 25 years, we have lived under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, whose protocols laid down detailed guidelines to ensure the safety of children. A few years ago, after Graça Machel's landmark report  on children in conflict, the UN Security Council solemnly pledged to expose and punish any warlords or regimes that violated the rights of children. Yet as the year ended, Amnesty International  published sickening evidence of the systematic use of torture and rape in Iraq, where more than 5,000 young Yazidi women and girls have become sex slaves, many sold off by Islamic State terrorists who have published guidelines for militants permitting rape, beatings and the trading and sale of non-Muslim girls. So why is it that the violation of children's rights has become so common today that abuses are barely reported across our international media? It is true that in many parts of the world, children have no voice and that their rights are only what patriarchs decree, their opportunities no more than what autocratic rules deign to confer on them, and whether it be in the continuing practice of child marriage, child labor, child trafficking or discrimination against girls, children's rights are systematically violated almost with impunity.Today 150 million children are engaged in child labor -- many in slave conditions -- when they should be at school. Another 15 million school age girls are married off before they have finished their education, often against their will. The improvement in educational opportunities in the poorest countries is so slow that only 5 percent of young people in 2050 sub-Saharan African countries, it is predicted, will go to college or university. But what's new about 2015 is the fight back that children themselves are leading. More aware than ever of the gap between the opportunities they desire and the opportunities delivered to them, young people are beginning to demand that their right to education be taken seriously. Youth protest groups such as embryonic civil rights movements are being formed in the most unlikely of places and among the most vulnerable of people -- from Nepal, where girl slaves are rebelling and Bangladesh where child marriage free zones are being established by girls themselves, to Ethiopia where the yellow movement of students is demanding equality of opportunity and Nigeria where Bring Back Our Girls is keeping the world's attention fixed on abducted girls. One immediate demand is for safe schools -- that governments do everything in their power to remove the fear that children and their parents have that their school is an easy target for attacks. But the long-term demand is that we bridge the gap between the opportunities young people desire and the opportunities they are delivered."

Or should it focus on one element (the ways for altruistic travelers to give back, for example) at the expense of another (the tourism context inspiring such responsible behavior) and preserve the sense of progress and development?

Photo courtesy of Rachael Imam and Soft Power EducationTravel-Inspired Community Service For decades, high-minded, compassionate and generous travelers have understood the virtues of sharing time and money with worthy projects around the world. Students have offered their vigor and energy. Skilled professionals have donated their services. People of all stripes have made good with their time and money to improve the lot of others less fortunate.Today more than ever before, there's a sweeping sense of travel-inspired community service, with a broad embrace of the whole globe as our community. It has prompted growing numbers of free-spirited, adventure-minded explorers to step out of familiar routines and then interact with the world around them in ways that make a positive and lasting impact on the people and communities they visit and of which they are a part.But while there's nothing new about the desire to give as much as (or more than) one gets, many of the means by which such charitable assistance can be delivered are quite novel. And these days the knowledge of how best to leverage both big-heartedness and the jargony lexicon used to describe it is constantly in flux. More than just a work in progress, the whole complex of thoughts and actions associated with voluntourism, volunteerism, volunteering, service learning, charity challenges, travel fundraisers etc. is constantly shifting its basic shape and its substance.This is all the more true as volunteering and fundraising topics are no longer as standalone as they once were. The activities with which they are associated are being integrated into the broad and growing pool of commercial but no less authentic travel experiences so appealing to new generations of travelers. The Inspired Escapes water safari engages in a local clean water project, shadowing local residents as they build clean water wells in their community. Photo courtesy of Inspired EscapesAcknowledging Complexity So how could all of this be tackled in one guide, knowingly surrendering to an incomplete picture while hoping to provide as broad and as deep a base of understanding as possible? How could this unwieldy topic be introduced without overwhelming the casual traveler or being too jejune? How could this be accomplished without painting with too broad a brush and misrepresenting the work being done - undermining the good or erroneously overvaluing the bad? How could it be part of a collaborative effort to #MendNotEnd voluntourism?The trick was to acknowledge the complexity of the topic and tackle it from as many perspectives -- and with the input of as many voices -- as possible.That is most evident in Part 1 of the guide, called Good Actions: What's Being Done, which is, in keeping with the photographic analogy used above, the snapshot employing a fast shutter speed, freeze-framing topics and their contexts. A chorus of authoritative voices weighs in on a selection of typical activities through which service-oriented and philanthropic travelers have been doing good - working with children or wildlife, shoring up infrastructure and contributing to community development.

Liu and his partner, officer Rafael Ramos, were killed Dec. 20 as they sat in their patrol car on a Brooklyn street. The shooter, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, later killed himself. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f7071f00000002252cac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We face a critical breach in our nation between law enforcement and the public. This is illustrated today most deeply in New York City but travels the nation all the way to Portland, Oregon - and from north to south - and many of the same issues exist. In New York City, since protests began over the treatment of African-Americans caught up in the criminal justice system, the police union there has done everything possible to inflame tensions and undermine civil authority. It is generally a good assumption that any attack on a public servant is an attack on all of us. That was certainly the case when NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot dead by an assailant who earlier shot his ex-girlfriend, Shaneka Thompson. Liu and Ramos represented the diversity and promise of America. Ismaaiyl Brinsley claimed to be killing in revenge for police misconduct. Reform proponents of America's dysfunctional criminal justice system, in Ferguson and other cities, have argued during mostly non-violent demonstrations for legislative changes and court remedies. Violence has no place in this movement.Sadly, NYPD Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch laid blame for the deaths of Liu and Ramos on not just their killer but directly on NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has supported reform, and other conservative voices on Sunday televisions programs have indicted President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder for the deaths of these officers- along with clergy and non-violent protesters seeking to build a better America. This has been reckless rhetoric.The New York Times editorial board was correct when they recently said: ""that cops are (are acting like) an ethically impeccable force with their own priorities and codes of behavior, accountable only to themselves, and whose reflexive defiance in the face of valid criticism is somehow normal.""This attitude that law enforcement is above the law is reminiscent of when many rural county sheriffs around the nation proclaimed the U.S. Constitutional did not apply to them and therefore they would not enforce any gun enforcement measures passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by the President of the United States. The system as it stands is broken. We treat African-Americans differently in the criminal justice system then we do whites. Women are targets of domestic violence in a society that allows such violence to occur often with impunity. People that never should have had access to guns because they are so easy to obtain in the NRA's America can shoot down cops.African-American clergy, in an open letter to the people of the United States, wrote recently:We are...calling on clergy of all ethnicities and faith traditions to join us in leading our nation toward healing and reconciliation. We are asking you to join us in finding more than symbolic ways to address this issue that has plagued our nation since its inception. We are asking you to join us in appealing to your elected officials, opening your doors to protestors, holding community forums that encourage dialogue and communication between the community and law enforcement and/or doing the work in your individual houses of worship and communities that will ultimately bring about restorative justice.Right now we need to be about the building of a stronger America where the structural injustices of race are addressed and the hard work of reconciliation is engaged. There is too much violence. There is too much hatred. Our obligation is to build a better America. The deaths of Liu and Ramos will just be two more meaningless murders otherwise. To that end, police unions need to submit to civil authority and recognize we all have a role in addressing difficult issues of injustice. No one gets special privilege. Police unions should see communities of faith as places were the work of healing and justice can begin.Turing their backs on the mayor again at the Sunday memorial of Officer Liu shows us that many NYPD members see themselves not as servants of the law but as the law. This does not leave us in a hopeful place."

(AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc143252300005000d0c607.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Fergus Jensen and Fransiska NangoyPANGKALAN BUN/SURABAYA, Indonesia, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Divers tried to reach sunken wreckage from a crashed AirAsia passenger jet on Sunday but were forced to return to their ship by bad weather, as Indonesian officials said they had detected a fifth large underwater object believed to be part of the plane.Indonesia's meteorological agency has said seasonal tropical storms probably contributed to the crash, and the weather has persistently hampered efforts to recover bodies and find the black box flight recorders that may explain why the Airbus A320-200 plunged into the sea a week ago.""The weather is bad. There's a storm. It's windy,"" said a Reuters photographer on board a search and rescue ship in the search area off Borneo island.""Earlier, four divers were transferred to (Indonesian navy ship) KRI Banda Aceh but they canceled the diving because the sea currents were too strong.""Flight QZ8501 crashed into the Java Sea last Sunday, about 40 minutes after taking off from Indonesia's second-largest city Surabaya en route for Singapore. There were no survivors.Indonesian officials were hopeful of a breakthrough in the operation when they announced on Saturday that ships using sonar had pinpointed four large pieces of debris on the sea bed.The head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo, told a news conference in Jakarta on Sunday that a fifth object almost 10 meters long had been found.But although nine ships from four countries have converged on the area, with teams of divers including seven Russian experts standing ready, winds and high waves have meant progress has been agonizingly slow. WEATHER LIKELY A FACTORAir Force Lt Col Johnson Supriadi, speaking at a briefing for pilots in Pangkalan Bun, the southern Borneo town where the search operation is based, said efforts on Sunday would be divided between recovering bodies and locating wreckage and the all-important cockpit voice and flight data recorders.Until investigators can examine the recorders the cause of the crash remains unknown, but the area is known for intense seasonal storms. BMKG, Indonesia's meteorological agency, has said bad weather was likely a factor.""The flight document provided by the BMKG office shows fairly worrying weather conditions for the aircraft at cruising level on the chosen route,"" the agency said in a report.A source close to the investigation told Reuters that radar data appeared to show the aircraft made an ""unbelievably"" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the A320's limits.The Indonesian captain, a former air force fighter pilot, had 6,100 flying hours on the A320 and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, according to Indonesia AirAsia, 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based AirAsia.SHALLOW WATERThe objects that are the main focus of the search were located by ships about 90 nautical miles off the coast. The largest object is around 18 meters long.The suspected wreckage is lying in water around 30 meters (100 ft) deep, which experts say should make it relatively straightforward to recover if the rough weather abates.Efforts to capture images with remote operated vehicles (ROVs) were frustrated on Saturday by poor visibility.Thirty-one bodies of the mostly Indonesian passengers and crew have so far been recovered, including some still strapped in their seats. Many more may be still trapped in the fuselage of the aircraft. Nine Indonesian victims have been identified.The crash was the first fatal accident suffered by the AirAsia budget group, whose Indonesian affiliate flies from at least 15 destinations across the sprawling archipelago.The airline has come under pressure from Indonesian authorities, who have suspended its Surabaya to Singapore operations saying the carrier only had a license to fly the route on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.Indonesia AirAsia said it would co-operate with the transport ministry while it investigates the license.A joint statement from Singapore's civil aviation authority (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group said that AirAsia had the necessary approvals to operate a daily flight between Surabaya and Singapore.

The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The insurgency has killed over 10,000 people this year, according to a count by the Council on Foreign Relations in November. It is the gravest threat to Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, and a headache for President Goodluck Jonathan ahead of an election on Feb. 14 where he is being challenged by opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler seen as tough on security.After beginning their fight for an Islamic state five years ago in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, the militants have radiated outwards into porous border areas, threatening Nigeria's neighbors around the Lake Chad Basin.In northern Cameroon, at least 15 people died in an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants on a bus, officials said on Saturday.Cameroon's army has been trying to dislodge the Islamists from its Far North region with the help of air strikes.Nigerian Interior Minister Hassoumi Massaoudou said late last month that his country was ready to negotiate with Boko Haram, but did not even know who in the group to talk to.Baga came into the international spotlight early in 2013, when dozens of people, mostly civilians, were killed in fighting between the multinational force and Boko Haram. Many were burned alive in their thatched houses.The militants have also kidnapped hundreds of mostly young people in the past year. On Wednesday, gunmen abducted 40 boys and young men from the remote village of Malari, in a raid that residents and a security source blamed on Boko Haram.The parents of 200 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in April have said they said will ask the United Nations for help after losing faith in their own government.
