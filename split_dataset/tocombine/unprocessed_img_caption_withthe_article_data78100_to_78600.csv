0,POLITICS,Obama Administration Accused Of Violating Constitutional Rights Of Immigrant Detainees,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-immigrant-detention_us_55faff0ae4b08820d917bebd,A new report says conditions in immigrant detention centers are similar to those in prisons.,2015-09-17,"Detained immigrant children line up in the cafeteria at the Karnes County Residential Center, a family detention facility that was created last year. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Immigrant detention facilities are violating detainees' civil and constitutional rights and failing to meet basic standards of treatment, according to a scathing report released Thursday by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.The bipartisan commission, composed of four presidential appointees and four congressional appointees, urged President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to limit immigrant detention as much as possible, particularly for women and children.""All people, no matter whether they are immigrants or asylum-seekers, deserve to be treated as humans,"" Chairman Martin R. Castro, a Democrat who was appointed to the commission by Obama, said in a statement. ""Now, more than ever before, we need to treat fairly and humanely those persons, especially women and children, who are seeking sanctuary from violence and instability in their countries,"" he added.The report builds on months of backlash to the Obama administration's use of family detention. Opponents have argued for years that immigrant detention, particularly of non-criminals, is overly punitive. Last year, the administration fueled that criticism by deciding to ramp up family detention, and critics are hoping to eventually end the practice altogether.The USCCR report was approved by a vote of 5-2, with all four Democrats and an Independent voting in favor, and a Republican and an Independent dissenting. (The eighth commissioner recused herself.) Three of the commissioners who voted to approve the findings were appointed by Obama.The report discusses the commissioners' visits to two detention centers in May: the Port Isabel Detention Center, an adult facility, and Karnes County Residential Center, which holds women and children. In those centers, the commission observed conditions similar to those of prisons, in violation of the civil rights of those inside. Because being in the U.S. without status is a civil, not a criminal, offense, the facilities are supposed to be different from punitive ones, but the report claims that the Department of Homeland Security detains ""many undocumented immigrants like their criminal counterparts in violation of a detained immigrant’s Fifth Amendment Rights.""The panel also alleges that the government is not complying with the Flores settlement, a 1997 agreement that children should be detained in the least restrictive setting possible. A judge ruled in July that the government was violating that settlement. DHS is appealing the ruling, but the commission argues that the department should stop its appeal and follow the order by immediately releasing the families.However, the report does acknowledge the administration's response to the ruling, in which the government argued that it is already making reforms to family detention, including releasing mothers and children at a quicker rate except under extreme circumstances, and is therefore not violating the Flores settlement.The report states that DHS is violating detainees' civil rights and due process rights, in part by failing to provide them with adequate access to lawyers -- people in immigration proceedings have no guaranteed right to an attorney -- and information. In addition, the commissioners allege that DHS does not do enough to prevent and combat sexual abuse in the facilities, and say the agency should establish better procedures for reporting and make sure detainees who speak languages other than English and Spanish can communicate with officers. Along with releasing family detainees, the commission recommends that the government use alternatives to detention more often when they could be monitored in less restrictive ways, such as bond or supervised release. It also advises Congress to put more money into alternatives to the detention facilities and to end a mandate that DHS maintain at least 34,000 detention beds.Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for DHS, said the agency is reviewing the commission's report:DHS takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care. The Department is committed to ensuring that individuals housed in our all of our centers have the proper care and appropriate resources, that they are held and treated in a safe, secure and humane manner, and that their civil and due process rights are respected. We have consistently improved and updated our standards and policies to reflect this commitment.The report was released the same day that members of Obama's party delivered their own rebuke of family detention: a bill from Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats, that seeks to end the use of private prison companies. Like the USCCR report, the bill recommends ending family detention and using alternatives more frequently, as well as eliminating the mandate to maintain 34,000 beds.USCCR has shown its support for immigrant-friendly policies in the past, including by commending Obama for his deportation relief programs last year. Commission member Gail Heriot, an Independent, suggested in her dissent to Thursday's report that the commissioners started out with a bias against family detention.Heriot's dissent accuses the majority of relying too much on hearsay and news reports. She recounted her own observations of the facilities they visited and gave a far more favorable analysis, calling into question the veracity of the claims made about sexual assaults and other abuses reported.""The Commission thus went into this project intent on uncovering a scandal,"" Heriot said. ""Instead of conducting an actual investigation, it structured its initial fact-finding simply to amplify stale rumor and innuendo. No effort was undertaken to establish whether the allegations -- all of which were already public -- were fact or fancy.""  This article has been updated to include comment from DHS."

Greg Abbott (R) believes 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed should not have been arrested for bringing a clock that authorities thought was a bomb to school. ""The last thing we want to do is put handcuffs on a kid unjustifiably,"" Abbott said Thursday, according to The Dallas Morning News. ""Just call this a tragic situation. It looks like the commitment to law enforcement may have gone too far and didn’t balance all the facts.""On Monday, Ahmed brought a homemade clock to school to impress his teacher and show his love of robotics. His teacher, however, thought it looked like a bomb and reported him to the principal. Later in the day, police officers came to the school and arrested Ahmed, even though no one could prove he brought a bomb. ""We have no information that he claimed it was a bomb,"" police spokesman James McLellan said. ""He kept maintaining it was a clock, but there was no broader explanation.""There was no broader explanation, however, because it was just a clock. Ahmed and his supporters also suspected that he was targeted because of his name and skin color. He said that after he was pulled out of class and escorted into a room where four police officers were waiting, one of the men -- whom he had never seen before -- said, ""Yup. That’s who I thought it was.""The Dallas Morning News reported that ""Ahmed felt suddenly conscious of his brown skin and his name -- one of the most common in the Muslim religion.""Mohamed received an outpouring of support on social media, with President Barack Obama inviting him to the White House, Twitter inviting him to intern with the company and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg telling him to stop by its offices.On Thursday, Abbott said he had a brother with skills similar to Ahmed's, and they were something to be celebrated.""I admire those with ingenuity and we're trying to make Texas the state of innovation, where we promote young minds to achieve things like that,"" he said. ""It's very unfortunate what happened.""Abbott's response contrasts with that of the mayor of Irving, Texas, where the arrest took place. In a Facebook post Wednesday, Mayor Beth Van Duyne defended the police who arrested Ahmed.""To the best of my knowledge, they followed protocol for investigating whether this was an attempt to bring a Hoax Bomb to a school campus,"" Van Duyne wrote. ""I hope this incident does not serve as a deterrent against our police and school personnel from maintaining the safety and security of our schools.""Also on HuffPost:"

Rick Santorum is one of the rare GOP presidential candidates who has been open to raising the minimum wage.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_7_113_2961_1386%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- GOP presidential hopeful Rick Santorum proposed a novel concept Wednesday night to his fellow candidates in CNN's Republican undercard debate: Instead of catering rhetorically to the nation's business owners, perhaps the party should try to appeal to the masses who work for those business owners. Santorum put forth his proposal during an exchange with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Graham had been asked by moderator Jake Tapper where he stands on the minimum wage debate. Graham, in a stock free-market conservative answer, said the wage floor should not be raised by the government. He alluded to his parents, who owned a restaurant and bar.""If you're a waitress out there wanting more money,"" Graham said, ""I'm not going to increase the minimum wage. I'm going to try to create an environment where somebody else will open up a restaurant across the street to hire you away at a higher rate, or they'll have to pay you more to keep you.""Santorum seemed to think that answer provided little solace for the minimum wage waitress. He's the only Republican candidate, other than Ohio Gov. John Kasich, to express openness to hiking the minimum wage. A raise of 50 cents per year, over three years, would be reasonable, he argued. He said he isn't going to toe the party line on this particular issue.""Republicans don't believe in a floor wage in America,"" Santorum said. ""Fine, you go ahead and make that case to the American public. I'm not going to.""But Santorum went a step further, arguing that the minimum wage illuminates a larger problem with the way Republican candidates talk about work. The typical American, he noted, is the waitress, not the restaurant owner.""To me, if you're going to talk to 90 percent of American workers -- by the way, 90 percent of American workers don't own a bar. They don't own a business. They work for a living. They're wage -- most of them are wage earners,"" he said. ""And Republicans are losing elections because we're not talking about them. All we want to talk about is, what happened to our business? There are people who work in that business.""Santorum then told a story about what seemed to be the 2012 Republican National Convention.""I was at the convention four years ago, and on the signs -- on all of the seats the night I spoke was a sign that said, 'We built that,' because Barack Obama had talked about how businesses didn't build their own businesses,"" he said. ""Then we trotted out one small-business person after another for almost an hour that night talking about how they built their businesses. And that's wonderful. But you know what we didn't do? We didn't bring one worker on that stage.""""How are you going to win, ladies and gentlemen?"" Santorum said to the crowd. ""How are we going to win if 90 percent of Americans don't think we care at all?""Also on HuffPost:"

Three boys escaped, officials said, but the rest were washed away. Twelve bodies were recovered on Tuesday, some of them miles downstream in Arizona.The missing boy was identified on Wednesday as Tyson Lucas Black, 6, and officials said crews, some using sniffer dogs, were going back over the entire flood area, which extends for nearly seven miles (11 km) along the banks of Short Creek.Hildale, home to fewer than 3,000 people, is twinned with Colorado City, across the border in Arizona.Both cities are home to the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a collective shrug in response to Sen. Ron Wyden's (D-Ore.) questions about the devastating cyber attack on the Office of Personnel Management, a breach that purportedly exposed 22 million federal workers’ personal information to China.“The statutory authorities of the National Counterintelligence Executive, which is part of the NCSC, do not include either identifying information technology (IT) vulnerabilities to agencies or providing recommendations to them on how to secure their IT systems,” reads a letter from the NCSC dated Sept. 15. That responsibility, the letter continues, rests with the Office of Management and Budget or with each respective agencies’ Inspector General. Last month, Wyden asked the NCSC, which falls under the office of the Director of National Intelligence, whether it had identified the massive data trove as a potential security weakness before it was infiltrated by hackers. Included in the hacked data were tens of thousands of SF-86 forms, which are background check forms required for federal workers seeking security clearances.The potential compromise of those SF-86s -- some of which may have dated back to the 1980s -- has roiled the intelligence community, and may have put undercover U.S. agents overseas and their families and friends at risk of exposure. “The OPM breach had a huge counterintelligence impact and the only response by the nation’s top counterintelligence officials is to say that it wasn’t their job,"" Wyden said in a statement Wednesday. ""This is a bureaucratic response to a massive counter-intelligence failure and unworthy of individuals who are being trusted to defend America. While the National Counterintelligence and Security Center shouldn't need to advise agencies on how to improve their IT security, it must identify vulnerabilities so that the relevant agencies can take the necessary steps to secure their data.”In the letter, NCSC also told Wyden it is necessary to keep decades' worth of data on federal employees, despite concerns that this overstocking could make the database more fragile.“While it is possible that we may incur certain vulnerabilities with the retention of background investigation information over a significant period of time, its retention has value for personnel security purposes,” the letter reads.The ripple effects of the OPM hack, which was first revealed earlier this year, have yet to be seen, though government officials have been bracing for protracted effects on foreign operations. Katherine Archuleta, the head of OPM at the time of the hack, was forced to step down in wake of the scandal.The Senate plans to eventually take up a cybersecurity bill that would streamline the information-sharing process between federal agencies, something Wyden has long contended they are incapable of doing in a secure fashion under the current arrangement.“The Senate is now trying to respond to the OPM hack by passing a bill that would lead to more personal information being shared with these agencies,” Wyden said Wednesday. “The way to improve cybersecurity is to ensure that network owners take responsibility for plugging security holes, not encourage the sharing of personal information with agencies that can’t protect it adequately.” Clarification: Language has been updated to indicate that the OPM hack began in 2014, but was only revealed this year."

The state is suspending the 10 percent sales tax and 15 percent excise tax on recreational marijuana on Sept. 16, although some other fees, including local taxes and a regular 2.9 percent sales tax, still apply. The tax break amounts to about a $20 discount off an ounce of mid-grade pot in Denver, according to the Associated Press.Dispensaries across the state are advertising sales and hoping for a big turnout.“I think the holiday sort of sells itself,"" Caitlin Murphy, the director of marketing for pot dispensary Emerald Fields, told Fox 21 News.The president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, Tyler Henson, told the Denver Post that pot shops have been ""setting up, doing their advertisements and telling their customers to come on down for special deals.""""I would hope that we see long lines at stores, but it's kind of up in the air right now,"" he said.The day of mostly tax-free pot allows Colorado to comply with a complicated provision in the state's constitutional Taxpayer Bill of Rights. While the state's tax on the drug didn't bring in quite as much money as projected, overall tax revenue was higher than expected. That means Colorado has to refund the money from any new tax -- like the one on pot -- and revert that tax to zero. While the status of the refund depends on a vote later this year, legislators are dealing with the latter requirement by designating Sept. 16, the day after last fiscal year's records are finalized, a tax holiday. It could cost the state about $3 to $4 million.""We figured we needed a celebration -- just kidding,"" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) told the alt-weekly Westword last week. ""The tax on recreational marijuana will go off for a day because the language of the constitutional amendment tied to [Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights] calls for a second reauthorization. ... I don’t think anyone outside of four people understands this.""Hickenlooper, who opposed the 2012 measure legalizing recreational marijuana, stressed the challenges of building a regulatory framework around a substance that remains outlawed at the federal level, was cautiously optimistic in his conversation with Westword.""If I’d had a magic wand the day after, I probably would have reversed the vote,"" he said. ""Now I look at how far we’ve come, and I think there’s a real possibility that we’ll have a system that works.""Colorado received more revenue from marijuana taxes than from alcohol taxes between July 2014 and June 2015, according to the Marijuana Policy Project, a pot advocacy group.“Marijuana taxes have been incredibly productive over the past year, so this tax holiday is a much-deserved day off,” Mason Tvert, the group's director of communications, said in a statement Tuesday."

I wish I could take it back. I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.""Matt Hoggatt, a spokesman for Gautier police, said during a news conference Tuesday that Lamb had no criminal record, and there was no indication that he and Prentiss had a history of criminal domestic violence.Police have not released a motive for either shooting. University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but ""obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind.""Schmidt, a history professor, was shot three times in his neck, cheek and near the right eye in the doorway of his office with a book bag on his shoulder, an indication that he was either entering or leaving, Bolivar County Deputy Coroner Murray Roark said.Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time. Prentiss' ex-husband said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.""She was completely devastated,"" he said of his daughter to The Associated Press. ""She and her mother were absolutely best friends.""Prentiss' family members asked for privacy when contacted by The Huffington Post.The shooting at DSU led to an hours-long campus lockdown. Frightened students and faculty hid in classrooms and closets as authorities scoured the campus looking for Lamb. William LaForge, president of DSU, tweeted Tuesday morning that the lockdown had been lifted:Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes. He received a doctorate in education in the spring. He was teaching two online classes this semester, but an in-person class had been cancelled, LaForge said.Brandon Beavers, an education major, said he had a class with Lamb last year.""It was like that class you look forward to,"" Beavers told The Associated Press. ""It was just cool.""However, he said Lamb seemed agitated.""He was really jittery, like there was something wrong with him,"" Beavers said. ""He was never in a bad mood, but he was real shaky.""The Associated Press contributed to this report."

13,BUSINESS,The Case Against Raising Interest Rates,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-interest-rates_us_55f88af9e4b0d6492d63593d,To raise rates now would be an unfortunate signal from the Fed that the current job market is as good as it gets.,2015-09-16,"Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee July 15, 2014, in Washington. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f8a73f1c00002d00757174.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Dec. 18, 2008, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero. Unemployment was then 7.3 percent, and would later peak at 10 percent in October 2009. Six years, eight months, and 28 days after cutting rates to zero, with unemployment down to 5.1 percent, the Fed has to decide -- as it has 54 times since December 2008 -- whether it's time to raise interest rates.The case against raising rates now is fairly simple: Inflation is below the target, and while unemployment keeps dropping, wages aren’t increasing significantly. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy’s increasingly stuttering transition from one led by exports to one driven by consumer demand has sent its stock market diving, and a wave of volatility has swept global markets.The Federal Reserve uses monetary policy to achieve two goals: keeping prices stable and maximizing employment. The Fed also has a broad responsibility to regulate financial institutions and maintain stability.On the first point, inflation is now low and is predicted to stay that way. The Fed’s interpretation of stable prices is inflation that stays below 2 percent. Inflation in the U.S. has been beneath that target since 2012, and has fallen significantly since mid-2014 due to the drop in oil prices. Below, inflation is charted by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment strategy firm: In simple terms, when inflation is low, falling, and unlikely to jump anytime soon, there’s no reason for the Fed to raise interest rates.Maximum employment is trickier to judge than inflation. There’s no hard and fast number for unemployment, job openings or wage gains that would signal that the job market is at peak health. However, even with unemployment at a seven-year low of 5.1 percent and the U.S. economy having added jobs for a record 66 straight months, there’s still room for the job market to get stronger.The unemployment rate has fallen but wages have barely ticked up. The number of workers on the fringes of the U.S. economy has dropped significantly since the Great Recession, but things can still get better. A broader assessment of unemployment, called the U-6 rate, includes workers who want full-time work, but can only find part-time jobs, as well as workers who aren’t currently looking for jobs. That number is still 2 percentage points above its pre-recession level, at 10.4 percent:The job market, in other words, has improved dramatically. But there's still enough of what economists call slack in the job market that overall wage increases are minuscule, despite the low overall unemployment rate.To raise rates now would be an unfortunate signal from the Fed that the current job market is as good as it gets -- or at least as good as monetary policy should strive for the market to be.Workers deserve a central bank that aims higher than that. We may be just arriving at the point where workers have some bargaining power. But after decades of wage stagnation, including the last few years of frustratingly sluggish raises in the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression, that bargaining power shouldn’t be undermined by monetary policy.As University of Oregon economist Tim Duy put it, saying that 5 percent unemployment is good enough when you could get to 4 percent ""means denying jobs to roughly 1.5 million people.” And, of course, prematurely halting a falling unemployment rate means denying raises to millions more.On top of this, there's the intense volatility in global asset markets, beginning in China. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who opposes a rate hike, points out that in the U.S. ""markets have already done the work of tightening"" via a less dramatic decline in stocks and higher borrowing costs. And fears over global economic growth, he says, only further decrease the likelihood that inflation will suddenly spike.Inflation is low and falling, and the job market is good but can get better, and global markets are volatile. So why would the Fed raise rates now? As University of California economist Brad DeLong writes, the “arguments for raising interest rates right now are of appallingly low-quality” -- a few of them being anecdotes about high-flying startups, a desire to revert to conventional policies simply because they are conventional, and the harebrained idea that the Fed should raise rates now so it can cut them if the economy slows.Worries about tech bubbles neglect the fact that interest rates are a bad tool to deal with out-of-control app investing, and assume that any bubble, anywhere, is dangerous to the economy writ large. Normalizing policy just to be normal is an outright abdication of courage and credibility, and raising rates so you can cut rates is a bit like gaining 20 pounds so it’s easier to lose 15.There isn’t a compelling reason to raise rates. Doing so now would be a surprise and a mistake. "

I am deadly serious.""",2015-09-16,"Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina will tell you what she thinks of Social Security, but only after you vote for her.

""That is a dodge worthy of a very good politician,"" he told the former Hewlett-Packard CEO. Fiorina denied that she had just dodged. ""I am deadly serious,"" she said.Social Security and Medicare are popular programs that provide retirement benefits and health insurance to more than 50 million older Americans. The programs face long-term financing shortfalls, but sometimes politicians are shy about proposing reforms because older Americans like to vote and don't like to hear about benefit cuts. Without benefit cuts, the only way to fix the financing is tax increases, and Republicans hate those. Fiorina has plenty of company in her Social Security hiding place. Even members of Congress can be shy about reform. The most recent budget outline proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives punts the problem to a nonexistent bipartisan commission that would study the issue and ""report back with specific legislative proposals for Congress and the President to consider.""Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another Republican presidential candidate, said in July that we ought to ""phase out"" Medicare because of its long-term actuarial imbalance. He has not repeated the ""phase out"" suggestion and later claimed he had been taken out of context.Other candidates have been more forthright. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for his part, has called for benefit cuts, while former neurosurgeon Ben Carson has taken the hopeful position that it would be great if some people would just opt out of Social Security.Harwood is good at catching presidential candidates in egregious dodge attempts. After he'd told another reporter he agreed with Donald Trump's call to end birthright citizenship, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told Harwood he hadn't done so. ""I'm not taking a position on it one way or the other,"" Walker said."

Chuck Schumer looks on as comedian Jon Stewart urges Congress to renew aid for 9/11 first responders on Wednesday,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f9ca631c00002d007572c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) charged Wednesday that if lawmakers can’t renew health treatment funding for 9/11 first responders and survivors before it expires, they might as well give up on Congress completely. First responders and survivors from the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, walked the halls of the Capitol Wednesday with comedian Jon Stewart to pressure lawmakers to renew the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The legislation expires on Oct. 3.“If Congress can’t come together and help the first responders who are ill because they rushed to the towers, then we may as well forget this place altogether,” Schumer said.The new bill would make aid for first responders permanent, preventing any lapse in care. Some 33,000 injured and ill responders have at least one 9/11-linked condition, and nearly all of them sought treatment through the program last year. Out of that group, 3,700 people have a 9/11-linked cancer.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is expected to meet with the first responders, said the committees with jurisdiction over the program in both the House and Senate are working on the details of the legislation.“We do plan to extend the program,” McConnell said.Schumer praised McConnell’s intent to extend the program as “great news at last.”“This is really a very bright glimmer of hope on something so important to thousands who are dying of cancers and other diseases,” Schumer added.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said the Senate should include the renewal of the program in a continuing resolution to fund the government, which Congress is expected to move on before the end of this month. He stopped short, however of threatening to block a CR if it didn’t include the aid for first responders. "
