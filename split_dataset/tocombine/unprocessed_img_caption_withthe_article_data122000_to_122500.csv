0,SCIENCE,Simple Thought Experiment Helps Answer 'Arrow Of Time' Question,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-time-flows-forward-physics_n_5242481.html,,2014-05-01,"BRATISLAVA, SLOVAK REPUBLIC - MAY 26: American physicist and author Leonard Mlodinow poses during his visit on May 26, 2012 in Bratislava, Slovakia. (Photo by Vladimir Simicek/SME/isifa/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baebfa6250000cf0037e4e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Inside Science) -- Almost nothing is more obvious than the fact that time flows from the past, which we remember, toward the future, which we don’t. Scientists and philosophers call this the psychological arrow of time. Hot coffee left on your desk cools down, and never heats up on its own, which reflects the thermodynamic arrow of time.In a paper scheduled to appear this week in the journal Physical Review E, two physicists make the case that these two long-separate notions of time — one based on psychology and one based on thermodynamics — must always align.The principles of thermodynamics show that large collections of particles, like the trillions upon trillions of liquid molecules in a coffee cup, always move toward more disorganized arrangements. For instance, hot water molecules clumped together in a cold room need a lot of organization, so warm drinks eventually cool to the surrounding temperature. Physicists say such disorganized arrangements have high entropy, whereas ordered arrangements have low entropy.Yet the equations physicists use to describe the simultaneous motions of large numbers of particles are equally valid whether time runs forward or backward. Therefore, almost any complex arrangement of matter will gain entropy no matter which direction time flows.Our universe apparently began with the Big Bang, which was a special, low-entropy arrangement. This seemingly unlikely and as-yet-unexplained observation gives rise to the thermodynamic arrow of time, which leads cosmologists to observe that the universe is evolving from a lower-entropy past to a higher-entropy future.Both arrows of time are so intuitive that their distinction is hard to notice, said Todd Brun, a physicist at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. “It took the human race millennia before people even realized there was something to be explained.”In the past century, however, physicists and philosophers have begun trying to unite the thermodynamic and psychological arrows. Many researchers note that real-world objects that store memories -- such as human brains and computer hard drives -- often heat up as they operate. Heat generation increases entropy and is an irreversible process, so the laws of thermodynamics require that such objects can only run in one direction: from past to future.But memories don’t have to generate heat, point out Brun and physicist Leonard Mlodinow of the California Institute of Technology. For example, ripples on a pond record a rock falling into the water, and yet could, in principle, travel in reverse. Could such a memory remember the future instead of the past, the researchers wondered?To answer this question, Mlodinow and Brun conducted what is known as a thought experiment. They imagined a system in which a chamber full of bouncing particles is connected to a nearly empty chamber of the same size by a tunnel through which particles can pass one at a time — a low-entropy configuration similar to the concentration of matter in the early universe. Although particles can cross from either chamber to the other, thermodynamics ensures that eventually both chambers will contain roughly equal numbers of particles.If a rotor is set up to turn each time a particle passes through the tunnel, and every turn of the rotor is recorded, this record would show the arrangement of particles at any time in the past. But according to the laws of motion, the particles’ future locations are completely determined by their current trajectories, and if at any point the flow of time were reversed, the particles would return to their initial low-entropy configuration. So the authors write that the rotor could be seen as recording the system’s future as well — a point made over 200 years ago by the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace.But there is a catch, Mlodinow and Brun argue. If one were to tweak a future state of the system just slightly, by altering the position or velocity of one or more particles, and then run it backward, the system would no longer decrease in entropy. It would increase.The particles would begin moving just like a movie playing in reverse, but in anything but the simplest systems, the tweaked particles would soon collide with others and cause a chain reaction. Any snapshot of the system would soon no longer resemble the corresponding frame of the original movie.Only the exact arrangement of particles resulting from a low-entropy initial state can evolve backward in time to reach a state with such a high degree of order, the authors write. Even minor rearrangements of that system, no matter how similar, will evolve backward toward higher entropy instead. In other words, for any initial condition, the rotor will be able to “remember” only one future that does not violate the thermodynamic arrow of time.This specificity contradicts the definition of a memory, the authors argue. They write that a memory should be able to include all the ways a system can evolve, not just a particular one. For example, your brain will be able to record virtually any series of events that befall you in the next three hours. If it were capable of recording only one particular series of events, like a speedometer stuck at one speed, your brain would not be a functioning memory. Because of this requirement, even a simple, reversible memory can record only the thermodynamic past and not the future, Mlodinow and Brun write.With their thought experiment, the authors have created a novel and useful definition of a memory, said Craig Callender, a philosopher of physics at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s new in the sense that they are…really building in a condition to what a memory is.”Lorenzo Maccone of the University of Pavia in Italy agreed that the authors' research raises an important point by arguing that even a reversible memory should have an arrow of time. But he found that the authors' thought experiment did not describe exactly how the rotor would record the future configurations of particles. Without such a description, Maccone said, “I’m not entirely convinced of [their] explanation.”Andreas Albrecht, a cosmologist at the University of California, Davis, wishes the authors had questioned the assumptions behind the thermodynamic arrow of time. In a paper recently posted to arxiv.org, Albrecht argued that there may be ways to get a thermodynamic arrow without requiring all the universe’s matter to start in one highly unusual arrangement. By taking this arrangement as a given, Mlodinow and Brun miss an opportunity to explore other possible starting configurations, Albrecht said. “[The study] brushes up so close to incredibly interesting [cosmological] questions and then just walks past them.”Gabriel Popkin (@gabrielpopkin) is a freelance science and environmental writer based in the Washington, D.C. area.

She is expected to testify later before the Senate Finance Committee at a date yet to be set.Republican strategists say the more dramatic moments in the hearings, where Burwell will face a litany of tough questions from Republican lawmakers, could yield rich material for television ads and social media campaigns.""Ultimately, it may be Republicans' only opportunity, certainly before the end of the summer and maybe before the election, to have a senior administration official available to answer these questions,"" said Lanhee Chen, who advised Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on domestic policy during the 2012 campaign.One Republican aim is to trip up the 48-year-old White House budget director and force embarrassing slip under the glare of the televised proceedings.""One gaffe and they lose the news cycle,"" a Republican Party strategist said.Obamacare is the No. 1 issue for Republicans in the November elections. While opinion polls show that most Americans dislike the law, the party needs to keep the intensity of its attacks high to turn out key electoral blocs including the Republican faithful, senior citizens and conservative-leaning independents. FOCUS ON ALL 'DISASTERS'""The confirmation process is likely to focus on all of the Obamacare-related disasters,"" said Brook Hougesen, a spokeswoman with the National Republican Senatorial Committee.For the benefit of independent voters, Burwell will be grilled about tax penalties for individuals and businesses that fail to comply with the law's coverage mandates, as well as the canceled insurance plans that Republicans say belie Obama's pledge that people would be able to keep their health plans.For senior citizens, a dependably major presence in midterm elections, there will be questions that showcase Republican charges that Obamacare represents a danger to Medicare benefits. Republicans boast that the same message helped them to victory in a special congressional election in March in Florida, where Republican David Jolly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in a district with a large elderly population.Republicans also intend to use the hearings to pressure vulnerable Democrats into breaking ranks with the White House by voting against the Obama nominee, joining an expected majority of Republican senators. This week, Louisiana's five Republican congressmen called on Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu to place a hold on the Burwell nomination - a largely symbolic gesture intended to delay a final vote. CONFIRMATION EXPECTEDRepublican officials, Senate aides and lobbyists say the party's aim is not to prevent Burwell's confirmation, or attack her directly. She is viewed by both sides as a capable public servant and is widely expected to be confirmed by a divided chamber.""Cursorily, she looks very good to me. But she's going to have to answer some really tough questions is all I can say. And I'll have plenty of questions,"" said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.For weeks, Republicans have looked on with frustration while Obama and his Democratic allies enjoyed a run of upbeat news on Obamacare.More than 8 million people have signed up for private health coverage, a performance that surpassed the most optimistic forecasts. Instead of the feared sticker shock on premiums, the cost of insurance in new Obamacare marketplaces has been lower than expected, as is anticipated federal spending.Administration officials say Burwell's nomination could also start a new, less-polarizing chapter in the law's four-year history, if she is confirmed as the replacement for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who resigned in April.Analysts say none of this has put Republicans on the defensive. Forty-six percent of Americans hold an unfavorable view of Obamacare, versus 38 percent who favor it, according to polling data from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation in April. In states where Democratic Senate candidates face tough contests opposition runs as high as 60 percent. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)"

Astronomers say the planet may hold water on its surface and is the best candidate yet of a habitable planet in the ongoing search for an Earth twin.

What was once considered a sure-fire sign of life on distant planets may not be so sure-fire after all, a new study suggests. Instead, it may simply be the artifact of a lifeless world and its equally lifeless moon.“I like this paper. It’s a great concept,” says Sara Seager, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “I think the [scientific] community is gradually realizing that it might be impossible to be absolutely certain, based on its atmosphere, that an exoplanet hosts life.”Life on planets orbiting other stars doesn’t have to literally broadcast its existence: Radio signals are just one way earthbound scientists might detect biological activity elsewhere in the universe, says Hanno Rein, a planetary scientist at the University of Toronto, Scarborough, in Canada. Signs of life are much more likely to be subtle, especially if the organisms are simple. One way to look for such clues is to search for chemical evidence, particularly in light passing through the atmospheres of the planets, Rein says. By comparing the spectrum of light passing through an exoplanet’s atmosphere with that of the unfiltered light emitted by its parent star, astronomers can identify substances present in the exoplanet’s air.Thus far, Rein notes, scientists haven’t been able to agree upon a single chemical—oxygen, for example—that could be a conclusive sign of extraterrestrial life. But researchers generally agree that certain mixes of two or more chemicals in an exoplanet atmosphere could be a strong sign of life, Rein explains. Here’s the idea: A mixture of gases that would normally react until one is completely gone simply can’t exist over the long term, unless one or both of the gases is being constantly replenished—possibly by the biological activity of life forms. One easy-to-understand example, Rein says, is a mix of methane and oxygen. Left to themselves, those two substances react to form carbon dioxide. And if life on Earth weren’t continuously producing those two gases, chemical reactions between the two would eventually scrub the less prevalent one from the atmosphere, leaving only the other.Now, Rein and his colleagues propose a scenario that could easily lead researchers looking for extraterrestrial life astray. What if, they say, a distant exoplanet has a moon with an atmosphere of its own? And furthermore, what if that “exomoon’s” atmosphere contains large amounts of a gas that would typically react with one from the exoplanet’s atmosphere if given a chance? Even if neither body hosted life, the combined light from the two objects might easily be mistaken as having passed through a single atmosphere of a body that hosts life, the researchers report online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.In fact, with current instruments and observing techniques, astronomers might not even recognize that the distant exoplanet has a moon, Rein notes. The two bodies would be so close together that, as seen from Earth, their light would blend into one smudge. Consider, Rein says, the spectrum of light that distant astronomers might see if Earth—whose atmosphere is more than 20% oxygen—had a moon with a methane-rich atmosphere like Saturn’s moon Titan. In that instance, the single smudge of light would contain signs of both reactive gases.The team’s scenario “is a really very interesting way to get a ‘false positive’ ” for extraterrestrial life, says Wesley Traub, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Scientists could easily be fooled by such a blended spectrum, he notes, and it’s likely that they’d be fooled for quite a while. And if scientists ever did detect such a spectrum, “it’s not clear what the next step would be,” he suggests. Many of the techniques now used to detect exoplanets—such as observations of their gravitational effect on the movements of their parent stars, or mini-eclipses that occur regularly as they pass in front of the stars as seen from Earth—aren’t sensitive enough to detect the presence of an exomoon.This story has been provided by AAAS, the non-profit science society, and its international journal, Science."

From the rock bottom to highfalutin, Middlebrow is your accessible guidebook to the world of entertainment. Sign up to receive it in your inbox here.On Sunday, April 27, Lorde called out Complex via Tumblr, taking aim at the magazine for profiling Iggy Azalea and later publishing a review which ""shit on"" the rapper’s latest album. Azalea responded in angry agreement, calling the industry ""spineless,"" and the Internet is still talking about both artists' complete disregard for journalism. Though that conversation is worth having, beyond Lorde's apparent inability to distinguish members of the press from publicists, there’s an issue of celebrity entitlement at play here. Before we continue onward with the misplaced umbrage of Lorde et al, let’s touch briefly on that discussion about journalism, because it’s not unimportant. Lorde is wrong to think criticism equals a lack of respect. As Complex wrote it in their response “If [we] -- or the media at large -- operated the way Lorde wished, it would do away with journalistic integrity all together.” Or, as Tom Hawking put it over at Flavorwire, “you might as well just have publicists send out press releases straight to fans and be done with it.”With the ethics of journalism safely intact, we can start to unpack the issue of celebrity entitlement. What exactly is Lorde talking about when she says the word “respect”? What does she think she (or any artist) is owed by the press or fans in general? The stupid and easy response is that she is a 17-year-old “adult baby alien” and probably we shouldn’t even be listening to anything she says. But the (again, stupid) immaturity excuse doesn’t work for Azalea and definitely doesn't apply to 35-year-old James Franco, who called Ben Brantley an “idiot” and a “little bitch” after a less than laudatory review of “Of Mice and Men” in the New York Times.Perhaps our capacity for legitimate criticism has waned as a backlash to our constantly-shaming culture. (The trend we see with body-shaming is a great example that applies across the board.) At least part of this is a direct result of the parenting and schooling of millennials, in which there is a prevalent sense that everything gets a gold star, to the extent that Generation Y has been referred to as ""trophy kids"" (full disclosure: I am a millennial / got lots of gold stars). But, whatever the cause, in becoming hyper aware of the impact of criticism, we’ve also become intolerant of critiques that are intellectually and artistically valid.There is plenty of crappy shaming on the Internet, but let's be plain: artistic criticism is really definitely not shaming. Our sensitivity to negativity should not impede our ability to think about art (or any version of work) and famous people do not get a pass to evade criticism just because they are famous (read: have lots of followers on Tumblr / Instagram / Twitter).There is an ongoing debate over the extent of the Gen Y issue of entitlement, but when you're dealing with celebrities, the effects are cast in an even sharper relief. If someone insulted Lorde's appearance, we’d rightfully rally behind her in exclamatory outrage. Her work, however, is fair game for critiquing, and that critique does not always require rainbows, butterflies or reverence for her fame. The normalization of hyper-sensitivity to criticism is a whiny trend at best, and at worst, a genuine threat to the free exchange of ideas. So, for every thin-skinned celebrity or Gen Y delicate snowflake out there: mind the gap between catty meanness and critical thinking -- in the realm of music journalism, but also in life.Follow Lauren Duca on Twitter: @laurenduca"

And it was just their third playoff series win since their last appearance in the NBA Finals … in 1979. A lottery spot during the NBA Draft was something of an annual tradition for the Wizards. But now, thanks to a wonderfully talented young backcourt, the team finds itself an upstart in the not-so-scary-after-all Eastern Conference. John Wall, the No. 1 pick in the 2010 draft, and Bradley Beal, drafted third overall in 2013, have both taken the next steps in their young careers. For Wall, the question has never been about his natural gifts -- they are limitless -- but rather his winning demeanor and how much he cared. The role of a point guard is to be an extension of his head coach. For much of his career, Wall flashed greatness but overshadowed it too often with turnover-riddled play and errant shot selection. He also couldn't extend the defense, because he couldn't shoot. All of that started to change during the second half of last season, but his improvement this season has been even more impressive. The 23-year-old averaged career-bests in points (19.3), assists (8.8) and perhaps most impressively, three-point percentage, up from 27 to 35 percent. In the series against Chicago, he played excellent one-on-one defense against D.J. Augustin, who shot 11-50 with the exception of a breakout Game 2. Offensively, Wall proved even better. The first-time All-Star, while inconsistent shooting the basketball, led the team to four wins by cutting down his turnover rate and greatly increasing his assist-to-turnover ratio; the true mark of a growing floor general.""I think me just playing with people that wanna win and know the game being with me helped my IQ,"" Wall recently told ESPN.com's Scoop Jackson. ""It's changed a whole lot. How I'm reading and seeing the game now. … I've changed a whole lot, man. I've grown a lot, matured.""For all his growth however, Wall desperately needed to be flanked in the backcourt by another robust talent. And Beal, not surprisingly, has been just that. Throughout the draft process, the silky shooting 6-foot-5 guard was often compared to Ray Allen. Such lofty expectations are challenging to meet, but Beal has done his best to show why they were set so high. Only 20 years old, the guard out of Florida has displayed a sterling scoring ability (his 17 points per game rank second only to Wall), and dynamic playmaking in the open floor. Better yet, as a knockdown shooter who converts over 40 percent from distance (tied for 20th best in the league), Beal has become an ideal floor-spacer for the naturally attacking Wall. According to Synergy Sports Technology, he's also improved his efficiency in the half-court from his rookie year.In Game 2 against Chicago, Beal became just the 10th player age 20 or younger to score at least 25 points in a playoff game, joining names like Magic Johnson (twice), Carmelo Anthony (twice) and Kobe Bryant. ""This year, he’s more mature already,"" Wizards head coach Randy Wittman told The Washington Post. ""I think he’s added to his game and he can do more off the dribble, get to the free throw line. He’s just not a spot up three-point shooter. … I think those are the strides that we’ve seen, as well as we’ve talked about John’s first couple of years in the league and what he’s done. If those guys stay committed in continuing to improve their games as they move forward, we’ve got a lot to be excited about.”Both Wall and Beal are improving defenders and excellent athletes who possess different skill sets that play off of one another very well. Look around the league and you will find a cadre of young guys in the backcourt with unbridled potential. And yet, none -- not even Golden State's duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson -- appear to have the same cohesion and potential as the pair in Washington. Wall will continually need to fight the image that he's more pizazz than substance, and Beal must further his driving ability in the half-court, but for the first time in a long time (sorry Gilbert), the future of pro basketball seems awfully bright in D.C.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

(fill in the blank),"" and one fills in that blank with whatever witticism aptly applies. I don't know if Erik Scott would appreciate the ""old musician"" reference, but since he and I did meet back in the early-'80s, it's likely the term applies to us both!And how would I fill in that blank on his behalf? ""He reinvents his artistry."" Earnest, perhaps, but, in his case, true.Actually, one of the perks of growing older (yes, there are some) is being around long enough to have people you like and admire swing back into your life; Mr. Scott, or ""Eski,"" as he's known to his friends, is one such person. It was 1981 or '82 when my band, Devon, was in the studio doing a demo with producer Craig Krampf, drummer extraordinaire of Kim Carnes fame, when I met Erik. Craig brought him in to play bass on our tracks and, given Erik's rock 'n' roll bona fides, we were all duly impressed. He gave those songs the punch of his signature sound and, it turns out, was an absolute riot in the studio. It was a great demo and, as I recall, a memorable time all around!After that excursion, I kept aware of what Erik was up to via mutual friends, and his musical resume was always an interesting one. His years with Alice Cooper -- as rowdy and wild as you can imagine (see photo above!) -- were just part of a roster of great musical collaborations, from Flo & Eddie, to Pops and Mavis Staples, and, more recently, the soulful alt/rock of Sonia Dada. There are details and photos from each of these eras (and more) on Eski's online biography.But it was around the time Erik swung back into my life, courtesy -- of course -- of Facebook, that he had already started his musical evolution. Moving from his rock roots to a more ambient, atmospheric sound, one in which his melodic and soulful bass lines were the salient point, he recorded Other Planets in 2010, a work described as ""ambitious, bright, delicate, dramatic, eccentric, energetic, intense, passionate."" Frankly, if you know Erik, that sounds like the man... well, except, maybe, for the ""delicate"" part! But it's his latest release, and the EARTH BLEEDS, that brings together the many influences that have informed his work in the last several years. As described on the CDBaby.com page: ""Former Alice Cooper bassist explores unconventional terrain filled with the mystical and haunting sounds of gypsy violins, Celtic melodies, steel guitar, and fretless bass ala Pink Floyd, and always with the deep groove of a space-age swamp.""Erik calls it ""World Celtic music."" Though ""space-age swamp"" has a certain ring... I asked Erik to share some thoughts with me about this latest piece; how he would describe it and what led him to the particular genre:""I do like this line....'A rocking bassist takes trips down unconventional musical roads, with apparently no rules or signposts. Medieval gypsy violins, Celtic melodies, surprises.'He talked a bit about the history of the country, the senses evoked when he visited certain sites:""I had finished 'Free' as an instrumental, but then while visiting Stirling Castle and the Highlands, I was reminded of the sacrifices some have paid for their freedom, in this case William Wallace, and I decided maybe I could write a few words to the music that became 'Free.'""""Free"" (see video below) is just one of the songs on the album that shimmers with the ""Scottish vibe"" to which Erik refers, a vibe beautifully threaded throughout the album with Shira Kammen's gorgeous ""Medieval violin,"" Fred Payne's haunting bagpipes; the English whistles of Steve Eisen, and John Pirruccello's mandolin and steel guitar. Add to that mix the stunning bass work of Eski, along with lush, exquisite vocals from Ana Maria Botero, Michael Scott, Mari Mack, and the Eskimo Dobbs Choir, and the musical statement of the album becomes a combination of dreamy, atmospheric, and still, in some cases, a bit raucous.  And, in an unexpected bonus, Erik steps up to the mic himself to lend his quirky, evocative vocals to a few tracks. Unique, slightly Bowie-esque, his wry interpretation of the lyrics adds a certain twist to words that initially appear playful but evolve into messages with meaning and nuance. In fact, there's no question the title of the album, and the EARTH BLEEDS, is a statement that speaks for itself (prominently posted on his Facebook page on Earth Day).Ultimately, any good musician -- old or young -- reinvents each time he or she picks up an instrument, writes a song, or puts vocals to their words. Eski Scott has conjured up a new version of his own artistry in and the EARTH BLEEDS, one that, particularly after repeated plays, becomes mesmerizing and hypnotic... a ""soulful and mystic brew.""

11,RELIGION,Hirsi Ali: Telling a Critic From an Islamophobe,"Kashif N. Chaudhry, ContributorPhysician, writer and human rights activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hirsi-ali-telling-a-criti-islamophobia_b_5229502.html,There is a difference between critiquing Islam and spreading irrational fear of Muslims. There is a difference between intellectually commenting on a religion and inciting hatred of its adherents.,2014-04-30,"Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Somali-born former Dutch deputy threatened with death for her outspoken criticism of Islam, delivers a speech during a support meeting in Paris on February 10, 2008. Ayaan Hirsi Ali sought European protection and possible French citizenship at the start of a visit to Paris today. French star philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy has spearheaded a campaign for Hirsi Ali to receive honorary French citizenship -- and financial aid to cover her security costs. Hirsi Ali is threatened with death for her role in writing the script of Van Gogh's film 'Submission', about the treatment of women under Islam. A note targeting her by name was found on his body. AFP PHOTO MARTIN BUREAU (Photo credit should read MARTIN BUREAU/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e60e200000c701018533.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a Somali-born U.S. citizen who is known -- among other things -- for her radical views on Islam. Her supporters consider her a leading critic, while many others believe she is guilty of Islamophobia and bigotry. I think she is a perfect case to educate people on the difference between the two.Hirsi Ali immigrated to the Netherlands in 1992, claiming to escape a forced marriage. There, she rose to become a member of the House of Representatives in 2003. However, she was forced to resign from the Dutch parliament when her biographical details were challenged and publicly exposed as a chain of fabrications. She admitted to the lies and decided to move to the U.S. Just recently, Hirsi Ali was in the news again when Brandeis University, which had earlier nominated Hirsi for a honorary degree, decided she was not a fit candidate for the honor. ""We cannot overlook that certain of her past statements are inconsistent with Brandeis University's core values,"" the university said. It added, ""For all concerned, we regret that we were not aware of Ms Hirsi Ali's record of anti-Islam statements.""There is certainly all freedom to hold a different opinion within Islam or about Islam. Intellectual criticism leads to dialogue, which in turn leads to better understanding. However, there is a difference between critiquing Islam and spreading irrational fear of Muslims. There is a difference between intellectually commenting on a religion and inciting hatred of its adherents.For better or worse, Muslims are not one unified community. As such, attributing the beliefs and acts of one extreme minority group -- like the Taliban -- to the whole community of Muslims worldwide is dishonest. Hirsi Ali is guilty of exactly this. She disregards the interpretation and practice of Islam by moderate Muslims and insists the interpretation of the terrorists is the only correct one. She contends that Islam is ""a destructive, nihilistic cult of death"" that must be defeated at all costs.In an interview with Reason magazine, this became clear when the interviewer asked if by ""defeating Islam"" Hirsi Ali meant, ""defeating radical Islam?"" She replied: ""No. Islam, period."" When the reporter asked her to further elaborate what she meant by ""defeat Islam"" she replied: ""I think that we are at war with Islam. And there is no middle ground in wars. Islam can be defeated in many ways... You look them in the eye and flex your muscles and you say, 'This is a warning. We won't accept this anymore.' There comes a moment when you crush your enemy.""The interviewer then asked, ""Militarily?"" Hirsi Ali replied: ""In all forms.""Hirsi Ali's defenders point out that she did not refer to militarily attacking Muslims but attacking Islam -- that it is kosher to attack an ideology as long as people were not affected. When pressed to explain how Islam would be ""militarily crushed,"" if not by military action on Muslims, they finally conceded that Hirsi Ali was in fact speaking of radical Muslims. This is all good, except that the only person who does not make that important distinction between radical Islam and moderate Islam is Hirsi Ali herself when she claims the threat is not from radical Islam but from ""Islam, period.""This dangerous xenophobia against Muslims is not surprising. Hirsi Ali has been stroking an irrational fear of Muslims amongst western audiences for the last many years. This has led to increased intolerance, even violence. Andres Breivik -- who went on a killing spree in Norway in 2011 -- praised Hirsi Ali in his manifesto, stating that she deserved a Nobel Peace Prize. Hirsi has supported anti-immigration policies that target Muslim communities in the west. She has also suggested that the U.S. constitution be amended to restrict Muslim civil liberties. She has called for closure of all Muslim day schools in the U.S. Imagine Hirsi Ali using the exact same words for Judaism, i.e., that Judaism is ""a destructive, nihilistic cult of death"", which must be militarily crushed. Imagine her advocating the closure of all Jewish day schools in the U.S. Imagine her saying the same things about any other religion or philosophy.I decided to carry out an experiment to see if Hirsi's defenders were indeed right and there was nothing wrong in saying what she did. I put ""atheism must be crushed in all forms, including militarily"" as my Facebook status. Reactions came in fast and I was labelled ""against the spirit of secularism,"" ""sad soul,"" ""intolerant and insane,"" ""no different from the Taliban,"" etc.I agree. Hirsi is not very different from the radical extremists she ought to be really targetting. She gives them credibility by claiming their version of Islam is the only correct one and others, like me, are ""bad Muslims."" Like the Taliban, Hirsi is rigid in her views and is judgmental. Like them, she speaks to curtail the civil liberties of fellow citizens and inspires intolerance and violence. We must not encourage such behavior with honorary degrees. Her bigotry must be condemned in all forms -- except militarily. This post was originally published in Pakistan's The Daily Times."

The United States is talking with Israel about the possibility of releasing convicted spy Jonathan Pollard early from his life sentence as an incentive in the troubled Mideast peace negotiations, a person familiar with the situation said Monday March 31, 2014. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c65a3c000032000df439.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What a difference 24 hours makes. On Sunday morning, Secretary of State John Kerry was already in a lousy mood. Forty-eight hours prior, Kerry found out that the nine months of his diplomatic life was essentially wasted after Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas -- perhaps to show the Israelis and the United States that he had options outside of negotiations -- decided to sign another pact with the Gaza-based Hamas movement in an attempt to create a national unity government. That announcement, made by Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, put the final nail in the coffin of Kerry's peace process. The Israelis, in response, cancelled any more direct meetings with the Palestinian delegation, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went on U.S. television to say that he would never negotiate with a Hamas-supported Palestinian government.Fast-forward to Sunday night, and Kerry's personal anguish turned into a public firestorm among virtually every major pro-Israel organization in the Washington area. Late on Sunday, April 27, the Daily Beast's Josh Rogin reported that Kerry warned of the possibility that Israel could revert to an ""apartheid state"" if its leadership proved unable or unwilling to sign onto a two-state compromise. By the close of business on Monday, the Obama administration's Republican critics in Congress and a list of pro-Israel groups lambasted him for the comments. Photo: APThe Emergency Committee for Israel argued in a statement that Kerry should be fired. AIPAC followed up with its own statement: ""Any suggestion that Israel is, or is at risk of becoming, an apartheid state is offensive and inappropriate."" Senator Ted Cruz took to the Senate floor Monday afternoon and demanded that Kerry hand in his resignation to President Obama. Earlier the same day, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said that the best thing Kerry could do to clear up any misunderstandings would be to apologize, both to the Israeli government and to the people of Israel. Even Senator Barbara Boxer, a reliable Obama administration ally on foreign policy matters, commented on her Twitter feed that ""any linkage between Israel and apartheid is nonsensical and ridiculous.""There is no question that apartheid is a loaded word. In fact, ""loaded"" may be a vastly understated description, given the horrific experience that black South Africans endured for decades under that system. In an ideal world, Kerry would have been more careful in choosing his words. Indeed, he acknowledged that he was careless in a statement put out by the State Department on Monday night: ""if I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word..."" But regardless of which word he chose to use, his overall point cannot simply be ignored as inconsequential or batted away as the murmurings of a radical, left-wing ideologue. For without a comprehensive two-state formula that Israelis and Palestinians can both agree on, it is a forgone conclusion that at some point in the future, an Israeli government will have to make the impossible decision of either defending the Jewish nature of the state, or Israel's democratic way of life. By virtue of demography, the Israelis cannot have both.Kerry is no bigot, nor is he hostile or prejudice toward the state of Israel, regardless of what his critics claim. As a member of the Senate for nearly thirty years and as a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before being confirmed as Hillary Clinton's replacement at the State Department, John Kerry was one of the most staunchest defenders of Israel that the chamber has seen in modern times. As secretary of state, he has come down on the same side as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the question of whether the Palestinian Authority should recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. Kerry, like Netanyahu, seems to view this as a requirement that Mahmoud Abbas needs to accept before any successful peace agreement can be reached. And, throughout the past nine months of diplomacy between both parties, Kerry has consistently had Israel's national security requirements at the forefront of his mind -- so much so that Mahmoud Abbas reportedly stormed out during one meeting with him after unveiling a partial framework accord. That doesn't sound like someone who, as the Emergency Committee for Israel implies, threatens Israel at every twist and turn.The words that Kerry used are, in a way, an unhelpful distraction from the point he was trying to make: the establishment of an independent and contiguous Palestinian state is the only way that the state of Israel can be both democratic and Jewish. Sometimes focusing too much on the words obscures the message."

He has been working out of a satellite office in San Mateo, California, and has spent much of his time building the RNC's Beacon, a national voter database search tool that has repeatedly been delayed.""My job is to build things,"" Barkett told reporters last summer.RNC Chief of Staff Mike Shields downplayed news of any change in Barkett's day-to-day role. In an email Wednesday, he said that Barkett was merely moving from dual employment at the RNC and at Data Trust, the private-sector company set up to house and maintain the RNC's voter file while avoiding campaign finance rules that apply to federal committees, to full-time at the RNC.""Now that he has completed his work with the private firm Data Trust, he is focused on the RNC,"" Shields said in an email.""Andy Barkett was hired as the first ever CTO of the RNC and continues in that role. His role has been and continues to be to help lead out our ever expanding data and tech infrastructure,"" Shields said.However, HuffPost was contacted Monday by a Republican operative with close ties to the RNC who said that Barkett was being ""shoved out"" but would stay on at the RNC in some capacity, at least through the midterm elections this fall, to avoid negative publicity.A second source in touch with senior RNC officials, when asked by HuffPost, said Barkett would be leaving altogether, but acknowledged that he could be kept on in a titular role to avoid unflattering news coverage. Barkett told HuffPost via Facebook message Monday that he was not departing. When asked if he was stepping back from day-to-day responsibilities, or whether he would continue in his current role without any changes, Barkett did not respond. A demotion for Barkett would be a blow to the RNC's effort to make itself the GOP's hub for tech innovation. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus has made data and technology key to the committee's mission and identity since the 2012 presidential election.It's unclear how a change in Barkett's role would affect Beacon or other RNC technology. Beacon has been in beta mode, testing in a small number of states since late 2013, and the RNC has said it will be tested in all 50 states soon. It was supposed to be available across the country by early April, but that deadline has now slipped to June, said one source at a Republican campaign committee. Beacon is a query tool that can be used to go into the national voter file, pull out names that match specific characteristics, and organize them into lists for campaign volunteers and staffers for phone calls and door knocks. Another source, a senior Republican operative in Washington who talks to principals at the RNC regularly, said development of the data tools Barkett has been working on has been slow, and progress has been ""worse than is known."" HuffPost granted anonymity to the sources because they were relating private conversations that shed light on the inner workings of the body that represents the Republican Party nationally and organizes and convenes meetings of all 50 state parties throughout the year. The RNC received $80 million in political donations in 2013.Talk of a diminished role or exit for Barkett, along with tales of slow progress on the suite of tools he's been building, is sure to be a topic of discussion at the RNC's spring meeting next week in Memphis, Tennessee.

(Wendy George/Huffington Post)</em></div>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e987b382500008605eafacd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Someone looking for a tarot reading in Brooklyn, New York would not have to search for too long. The city is rich with tarot readers from many backgrounds and belief sets.From witch covens to tarot readers to occult bookstores, the borough houses an active and eclectic community that has developed particularly strongly in the traditionally working-class neighborhood of Bushwick. Many of the tarot readers and spiritual explorers in this area have gathered in recent years around two focal points: the occult bookstore, Catland, and the biweekly tarot bazaar, Tarot Society. Between these and other affiliated venues, a diverse metaphysical community is forming. Meet 7 of the tarot readers who are actively shaping this community:DAMONDamon described himself as a “nerdy boy” in childhood, raised in a Catholic family, who spent most of his time in libraries. But he was always fascinated by divination, he told HuffPost, having grown up watching his grandmother tell fortunes with playing cards. “I can’t live in nihilistic world,” he said. “To me the notion that there is a way to connect to a higher consciousness is essential.” At age 14 he asked for his own deck of tarot, and by his mid teens Damon began training with a professional tarot reader.After leaving home, Damon hit the road. “I was a vagabond with my pack of cards,” he said, hitchhiking throughout his native South Africa with a friend. In their travels Damon and his companion developed an interested in the practices of the sangoma -- traditional root workers who use divination to communicate with spirits on behalf of the living. Damon and his friend journeyed to the Mautse Valley where the sangoma were said to live in caves while receiving spiritual training. They lived there for two months -- an experience Damon said set the tone for his future career as a ""spiritual practitioner."" His own spirituality encompasses paganism and witchcraft. “I self identify very strongly as a witch, and I see my practice as a card reader as an extension of witchcraft.” In his readings Damon uses two decks simultaneously with various talismans, or sacred objects, placed on the table for added magical potency. He is most comfortable, he told HuffPost, reading from metaphysical bookstores where he can incorporate other healing traditions into his practice (i.e. writing ‘prescriptions’ with certain herbs and incense or directing clients to the right candles or oils to use for various spiritual ailments.) “I want people to feel empowered and feel that they can take agency for their own spiritual practice.”STELLAStella bought her first tarot deck at age 13 with lunch money she had saved up. In the process of learning about the cards she befriended a classmate, Dante, who shared her interest and who would become a lifelong mentor and friend. Dante told Stella she was a “natural born witch,” a term mentioned often in the magical community and which, Stella said, refers to someone “born with their light turned on.” “The more I do tarot,” Stella told HuffPost, “the more I understand that when I’m reading at my best it’s because I have something to say that’s helping someone.” Between being a tarot reader, a sex educator, a BDSM educator, a consent educator and also doing manual labor and service jobs, Stella is humble about her work. “I’m not trying to be a big shot. If I’m doing my job right, I’m providing a service.”Stella describes herself as a “pragmatist.” For example, she was born with cancer in one of her hands which prevented her from using her thumb. When she was 17 she got reconstructive surgery that left her with chronic pain. To emotionally cope with the pain and reclaim that part of her body, Stella got an arrow tattoo on both of her wrists. Years later she walked into Catland, and one of the owners saw her tattoos and immediately mentioned the Norse god, Týr. According to myth, Týr was a one-handed god whose associated rune symbol was an arrow. “I wouldn’t believe in magic if I didn’t have some kind of evidence,” Stella said.BRUNOFor Bruno, reading tarot was never something he could share with his Catholic Italian family. He began exploring divination at the age of 15 at a time, he said, when there was a lot of interest in occultism among his peers. A friend bought him his first deck -- a practice of gifting which assumes the potency of a rite of passage for many, Bruno said. His first phase of tarot reading was characterized by exploration, reading for his high school teachers in secret and making after school visits to a local metaphysical bookstore. “When I was younger I had more of a wild approach [to tarot reading] because I didn’t have the knowledge of the history and the symbolism.” That said, the “wildness” allowed him to tap into the tarot as an intuitive tool, Bruno told HuffPost. “Being young I felt almost more in tune to it.”He put the cards away for several years, returning to them when he felt more “psychologically ready” to tackle the kinds of issues people might bring up in their readings. Nowadays Bruno promotes transparency in the occult community. “To me it would be beautiful if everyone could learn tarot,” he said. Bruno reads primarily at events like Tarot Society and his approach is what he describes as “new age.” “[Reading tarot is] something I do, but it’s also part of who I am.”CRIMSON KITTYCrimson Kitty grew up going to church every Sunday with her Episcopalian family. Her mother read tarot on the side, which added to the family’s pastiche of metaphysical inclinations. “My mom was a total witch even though to this day she’ll deny it,” Crimson told HuffPost. When she was 12 years old Crimson asked her mom to teach her the ways of tarot, but it wasn’t until she moved to Bushwick in 2013 and met Tarot Society organizer Darcey Leonard that she began reading regularly. With practice came skill. “I started saying things I wouldn’t normally say, words or sentences I wouldn’t normally use in my daily life.” Crimson also performs drag professionally but through tarot found a means for exploring her eclectic spirituality. “I am pagan,” Crimson told HuffPost, “but I have my own personal spirituality. I focus on a wholeness within myself.”Her readings emphasize the connection between reader and subject. “I have everyone shuffle the deck and take their time so they put their energy in there. If they’re not giving me energy, I can’t give them anything.” After this she shuffles the deck three times and takes a moment to absorb the energy, which she describes as being “like a vacuum through my throat. When I feel that feeling, I know it’s time to begin.”MOLLYMolly was “in the broom closet” for her first years of exploring witchcraft and tarot, she told HuffPost. She received her first deck as a gift from her mother at age 15 but didn’t begin reading for others until college. Those initial years were critical, though, for Molly to develop a personal relationship with the cards. “My deck knows me through and through,” Molly said. She turned to it in times of distress and confusion, cultivating an ""inner wisdom"" that would benefit her in future readings. Several years ago Molly had what she described as a transformation. She went onto YouTube and began watching videos of protection mantras. Without noticing the time, three hours passed, inducing a state of “high” that she said lasted for four days. From then on she quit smoking, developed a yoga practice and began studying the tarot in a more focused way than she had before. “[Tarot] has a way of getting under your skin,” Molly told HuffPost. Molly has been reading tarot professionally for a year. It has taken on renewed importance in the wake of her transformation. “Tarot has been my entrance into believing I’m a spiritual person,” Molly said.

But he was always fascinated by divination, he told HuffPost, having grown up watching his grandmother tell fortunes with playing cards. “I can’t live in nihilistic world,” he said. “To me the notion that there is a way to connect to a higher consciousness is essential.” At age 14 he asked for his own deck of tarot, and by his mid teens Damon began training with a professional tarot reader.After leaving home, Damon hit the road. “I was a vagabond with my pack of cards,” he said, hitchhiking throughout his native South Africa with a friend. In their travels Damon and his companion developed an interested in the practices of the sangoma -- traditional root workers who use divination to communicate with spirits on behalf of the living. Damon and his friend journeyed to the Mautse Valley where the sangoma were said to live in caves while receiving spiritual training. They lived there for two months -- an experience Damon said set the tone for his future career as a ""spiritual practitioner."" His own spirituality encompasses paganism and witchcraft. “I self identify very strongly as a witch, and I see my practice as a card reader as an extension of witchcraft.” In his readings Damon uses two decks simultaneously with various talismans, or sacred objects, placed on the table for added magical potency. He is most comfortable, he told HuffPost, reading from metaphysical bookstores where he can incorporate other healing traditions into his practice (i.e. writing ‘prescriptions’ with certain herbs and incense or directing clients to the right candles or oils to use for various spiritual ailments.) “I want people to feel empowered and feel that they can take agency for their own spiritual practice.”STELLAStella bought her first tarot deck at age 13 with lunch money she had saved up. In the process of learning about the cards she befriended a classmate, Dante, who shared her interest and who would become a lifelong mentor and friend. Dante told Stella she was a “natural born witch,” a term mentioned often in the magical community and which, Stella said, refers to someone “born with their light turned on.” “The more I do tarot,” Stella told HuffPost, “the more I understand that when I’m reading at my best it’s because I have something to say that’s helping someone.” Between being a tarot reader, a sex educator, a BDSM educator, a consent educator and also doing manual labor and service jobs, Stella is humble about her work. “I’m not trying to be a big shot. If I’m doing my job right, I’m providing a service.”Stella describes herself as a “pragmatist.” For example, she was born with cancer in one of her hands which prevented her from using her thumb. When she was 17 she got reconstructive surgery that left her with chronic pain. To emotionally cope with the pain and reclaim that part of her body, Stella got an arrow tattoo on both of her wrists. Years later she walked into Catland, and one of the owners saw her tattoos and immediately mentioned the Norse god, Týr. According to myth, Týr was a one-handed god whose associated rune symbol was an arrow. “I wouldn’t believe in magic if I didn’t have some kind of evidence,” Stella said.BRUNOFor Bruno, reading tarot was never something he could share with his Catholic Italian family. He began exploring divination at the age of 15 at a time, he said, when there was a lot of interest in occultism among his peers. A friend bought him his first deck -- a practice of gifting which assumes the potency of a rite of passage for many, Bruno said. His first phase of tarot reading was characterized by exploration, reading for his high school teachers in secret and making after school visits to a local metaphysical bookstore. “When I was younger I had more of a wild approach [to tarot reading] because I didn’t have the knowledge of the history and the symbolism.” That said, the “wildness” allowed him to tap into the tarot as an intuitive tool, Bruno told HuffPost. “Being young I felt almost more in tune to it.”He put the cards away for several years, returning to them when he felt more “psychologically ready” to tackle the kinds of issues people might bring up in their readings. Nowadays Bruno promotes transparency in the occult community. “To me it would be beautiful if everyone could learn tarot,” he said. Bruno reads primarily at events like Tarot Society and his approach is what he describes as “new age.” “[Reading tarot is] something I do, but it’s also part of who I am.”CRIMSON KITTYCrimson Kitty grew up going to church every Sunday with her Episcopalian family. Her mother read tarot on the side, which added to the family’s pastiche of metaphysical inclinations. “My mom was a total witch even though to this day she’ll deny it,” Crimson told HuffPost. When she was 12 years old Crimson asked her mom to teach her the ways of tarot, but it wasn’t until she moved to Bushwick in 2013 and met Tarot Society organizer Darcey Leonard that she began reading regularly. With practice came skill. “I started saying things I wouldn’t normally say, words or sentences I wouldn’t normally use in my daily life.” Crimson also performs drag professionally but through tarot found a means for exploring her eclectic spirituality. “I am pagan,” Crimson told HuffPost, “but I have my own personal spirituality. I focus on a wholeness within myself.”Her readings emphasize the connection between reader and subject. “I have everyone shuffle the deck and take their time so they put their energy in there. If they’re not giving me energy, I can’t give them anything.” After this she shuffles the deck three times and takes a moment to absorb the energy, which she describes as being “like a vacuum through my throat. When I feel that feeling, I know it’s time to begin.”MOLLYMolly was “in the broom closet” for her first years of exploring witchcraft and tarot, she told HuffPost. She received her first deck as a gift from her mother at age 15 but didn’t begin reading for others until college. Those initial years were critical, though, for Molly to develop a personal relationship with the cards. “My deck knows me through and through,” Molly said. She turned to it in times of distress and confusion, cultivating an ""inner wisdom"" that would benefit her in future readings. Several years ago Molly had what she described as a transformation. She went onto YouTube and began watching videos of protection mantras. Without noticing the time, three hours passed, inducing a state of “high” that she said lasted for four days. From then on she quit smoking, developed a yoga practice and began studying the tarot in a more focused way than she had before. “[Tarot] has a way of getting under your skin,” Molly told HuffPost. Molly has been reading tarot professionally for a year. It has taken on renewed importance in the wake of her transformation. “Tarot has been my entrance into believing I’m a spiritual person,” Molly said.

17,SPORTS,What's Next For The Chicago Bulls?,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-bulls_0_n_5227932.html,,2014-04-30,"Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah walks off the court after a 75-69 loss to the Washington Wizards in Game 5 of an opening-round NBA basketball playoff series Tuesday, April 29, 2014, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7557a2200005700dd08b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It wasn't long ago that the Chicago Bulls were poised to be the challengers to the big, bad Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference. It was a natural rivalry full of star power. The Bulls had one of the game's most devastating young players in homegrown MVP Derrick Rose, flanked by a terrific two-way wing in Luol Deng and rising stud at center in Joakim Noah. They had a mastermind head coach in Tom Thibodeau, a defensive guru who played a key role in Boston's championship run under Doc Rivers. But that was three years ago -- before Rose had two catastrophic knee operations and sat out the entire 2013 playoffs, and before Deng was traded. There comes a time in the NBA when you need to move on. Start over. Cut your losses. And for the Bulls, that time has come. After its second premature postseason defeat in a row (last year's team beat Brooklyn in the first round), the payroll remains bloated with Carlos Boozer's albatross of a deal (he will make $16.8 million next season), and with Rose, who will make more than $60 million over the next three years. While Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf still has his amnesty clause available, he has appeared hesitant to invoke it and send Boozer somewhere else.Very few coaches, if any, could have kept a team afloat as Thibodeau has without Rose. But there's still a strong chance he will not be retained. While Thibodeau has another two years on his deal, both he and the players may be in need of a change. And plenty of other franchises would be interested in Thibodeau, who remains one of the most respected coaches in the league. Perhaps the most challenging question for Chicago's front office is whether or not to keep Rose. Are his health concerns too serious? Coming back from a torn ACL is certainly doable, but for a player like Rose -- who relies so greatly on his explosion, torque and powerful leaping ability -- there's good reason to think he will never again be the dynamic talent he once was. Is this roster good enough to survive if Rose proves to be a different kind of player once he returns?Here's one way to think about it: There are two immovable players. One of them is Noah. The other is third-year man Jimmy Butler, who will likely get a contract extension this summer. Both are superb defensive weapons -- Noah is an elite big man passer, and was just named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year -- and both have yet to play their best basketball, since Butler is just 24 and Noah is 29. Chicago can even trade Rose for young assets or draft picks. Both of the next two drafts appear loaded with star talent. Rose will be 26 when the 2014-15 season begins, and even if he doesn't come back playing at the height of his powers, he should still command a high pick. Another viable option is to pursue New York Knicks free agent Carmelo Anthony. While it would take some creative financial moves -- perhaps shedding Boozer's contract -- it is certainly possible, especially with Rose as a selling point to be Melo's point guard of the future. The salary cap is expected to increase by $5 million next season, bringing it to a total $63 million (and the luxury tax to $77 million), which will provide more flexibility. Anthony's presence would instantly change Chicago's long-term fate. It's extremely difficult to acquire a superstar in his prime, and to have two, along with Noah and sound ancillary components Butler and Taj Gibson, would be lethal.The NBA is not a league that rewards teams for being stuck in the middle. It's best to be either a front-runner or in total rebuilding mode. Since the former isn't an option right now and we don't know whether signing Anthony is actually feasible, rebuilding might be the best way to go. It worked for once-lowly Washington (drafted John Wall and Bradley Beal), Golden State (drafted Stephen Curry) and even Portland (drafted Damian Lillard). Chicago has two first-round picks currently projected at Nos. 16 and 19. The Bulls have been able to remain afloat despite Rose's injuries, but now is the time to decide where this franchise is going to go in the next several years.

Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort in Destin, Florida a sprawling 2400 acres of resort in northwest Florida's lush Emerald Coast, has become a major destination for year-round fun and allowed me to unplug just enough to remain slightly off the grid without going insane. With a variety of accommodations in four distinct areas of the property -- Beachside, Bayside, Lakeside and The Village -- everyone can enjoy find a place to hang a pair of sandals in one of the more than 1,200 available rooms, condos and villas. Family friendly with a enough romance to attract couples the more than seven miles of pristine beaches and bay front are not to be outdone by four championship golf courses, 15 world-class tennis courts, 19 swimming pools and a fitness center and spa. Not to mention that boating enthusiasts can pull right up and dock at the 113 slip marina. It is easy to see why this property was rated as one of the 2014 Best Hotels in the USA by U.S. News & World Report and one of the Best Travel Finds of 2014 by Redbook magazine with a personal thumbs up to Sandestin as a destination that should appear on every vacationers' radar. During my recent stay I was lucky enough to enjoy the 28th Sandestin Annual Wine Festival, the most established and continuously running wine festival on the Coast. Known as the ""Kentucky Derby of Wine Festivals,"" guests reveled in this opportunity to discover more about the wonderful world of wine.They uncorked sun in the fun over four days of unique events which included wine dinners at Marlin Grill, wine dinners at Poppy's Seafood Factory, wine seminars, wine tastings, delicious food pairings, and an unrivaled Sunday brunch by the Bay. Wine novices and connoisseurs were able to sample from a comprehensive selection in all varieties, styles and price ranges. The Festival offered an unparalleled opportunity to meet winemakers, ask detailed questions about the wine making process and acquire hard to get selections. Proceeds from the Sandestin Wine Festival were donated to The Fisher House, an organization that provides free or low-cost lodging to veterans and military families receiving treatment at military medical centers and Sandestin Foundation for Kids, making a meaningful difference in children's lives. Plans are already under way for next year's event.Those who couldn't attend the Wine Festival still have plenty of opportunities to join in the fun as there always seems to be something happening at the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort. Fishing enthusiasts won't want to miss the Emerald Coast Blue Marlin Classic from June 18-22. Ranked as the fifth richest tournament in the world by Marlin magazine, contestants have a serious shot at winning serious money. Family fun for the landlubbers includes entertainment and activities for the kids all weekend long. For patriotic fun in July, you can't beat ""Red, White and Baytowne."" The Village of Baytowne Wharf will have activities for the kids including crafts, face painting, and balloon sculpting. A huge fireworks celebration is planned for the evening. Put it all together -- wine festivals, resort living, beaches, golf, relaxation in the sun, year-round events -- and it's easy to see why guests are destined for fun at the Sandestin.Photo Credits: Joshua Estrin"
