After indicating that ""Former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III will conduct an independent investigation into the NFL's pursuit and handling of evidence in the Ray Rice domestic violence incident"" in the opening sentence, the statement went on to note that ""Director Mueller's investigation will be overseen by NFL owners John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers"" in the second sentence.Here is a look at the entire statement, courtesy of Albert Breer of NFL Network:In an attempt to clarify their roles in the investigation, Mara and Rooney released a statement of their own on Thursday claiming that ""our role is not to conduct or direct the investigation but to support Mr. Mueller and assist him in gaining whatever access or resources he needs.""Here is a look at that complete statement, courtesy of Pittsburgh Steelers PR:Whatever they may be, the results of this investigation will be made public."

It's connect-the-dots time! Here's my graphic line of connecting dots:1. Almost all scientists (97%) and businesses agree: our fossil fuel pollution is warming the Earth, which is making our climate more extreme - hotter, colder, wetter, drier. Check out the latest IPCC reports. Insurance companies, major banks, and other major businesses agree.2. Fossil fuel pollution is increasing yearly, damaging our economies by increasing health costs, crop and environmental damage, driving rising sealevels, and fueling further climate change with ever worsening catastrophic weather - think megadroughts, for example. 3. It will get worse -- much worse, because of ferocious feedbacks, such as: The angle of sunlight, combined with reflection from white polar ice, helps keep the poles cold, and the planet cooler. (Image, NASA)a. the albedo effect: darker waters replacing melting white ice (eg, Arctic ice cap, a large planetary heat shield) will absorb far more heat, feeding global heating; * *The accelerating release of a very potent greenhouse gas, methane, from melting giant reserves in the tundra and undersea, has been called the methane bomb, because it could explosively increase global heating.   b.  release of more greenhouse gases from gigantic reserves in the tundra, undersea methane deposits, and soils worldwide, as global heating warms them.* *4.  Renewable clean energy (especially solar and wind) is as cheap as fossil fueled energy in some US areas, getting cheaper, is spreading, and is becoming a mainstream power source for US consumers -- but not fast enough.5. The US clean energy sector is the fastest growing economic and job sector of our economy.  6. Technology and financing mechanisms continue to make clean energy more affordable.7. Energy storage technology now makes clean energy as reliable as fossil fuels - we can make a massive switch to clean energy now.8. Delay has already cost the world trillions. Further delays will be costlier, as extreme weather costs skyrocket.* *9. The major roadblock are political leaders who do not support clean energy. 10. YOU CAN ACT:  a. Urge Congress to Support Clean Energy Victory Bonds Bill - contact your representatives. b. VOTE FOR CLEAN ENERGY LEADERS this November and in all future elections - make clean energy a top voting priority, and urge friends and family to do the same. c. Speak out: join the worldwide CLIMATE MARCH September 21, 2014 - within the US, in New York, and elsewhere. Go here to learn more.

Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. listens to reporter's question during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, April 2, 2014, where he spoke about the Supreme Court decision in the McCutcheon vs. FEC case, in which the Court struck down limits in federal law on the aggregate campaign contributions individual donors may make to candidates, political parties, and political action committees. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d5a53c000018010df913.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The nation's leading abortion rights organization isn't wasting any time in pushing back on Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) for saying he plans to support controversial judicial nominee Michael Boggs.Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, became the first Democrat to throw his support behind President Barack Obama's embattled nominee on Tuesday, telling Roll Call that he would vote Boggs out of committee if given the opportunity. Whitehouse said he would support Boggs in the ""spirit of deference"" to his two Republican home-state senators, who helped to nominate him. Other Democrats have been vocal in their opposition to the nomination.Boggs, who is up for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, has been stalled in the committee for months amid criticism from progressive groups and Democratic lawmakers over his socially conservative track record. A former state legislator, Boggs voted to keep the Confederate insignia on the state flag, to pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and to restrict abortion rights.NARAL Pro-Choice America has been one of Boggs' biggest critics, given his history on abortion rights. Whitehouse has a 100 percent rating from NARAL, but on Thursday, the group's president sent him a letter expressing ""profound disappointment"" in his decision to support Boggs.""Boggs’ record as a Georgia state legislator proves he has no place on the federal bench,"" said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. ""Boggs’ record stands as a troubling statement of his values -- values that are out of step with the vast majority of Americans.""Boggs once co-sponsored a bill that would have created a ""Choose Life"" license-plate program to fund anti-choice organizations, and he supported tightening Georgia's requirement that young women seeking abortions notify their parents. Boggs also voted in 2001 to require doctors who perform abortions to post personal information online, along with the number of abortions they had performed. (He recently told the Judiciary Committee he regretted that vote and didn't realize the public safety risks it would pose for doctors.)Hogue noted that Whitehouse took ""a principled stand"" against then-Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito over his opposition to abortion rights, yet with Boggs, the senator has not taken a similar stance.""You called on your opponent not just to vote against that nominee, but to support a filibuster in order to block his confirmation. Then, you took a strong position supporting reproductive rights in the context of judicial nominations,"" she said. ""Now, you have indicated that one senator's deference to another should trump our hard-fought freedoms.""""I urge you to reconsider your position on Michael Boggs, and to oppose this nomination,"" she added.In addition to directly appealing to Whitehouse, NARAL spent Thursday urging its members in Rhode Island to start flooding the senator's office with calls asking him to pull his support for Boggs. A NARAL spokesperson said the group's members are also calling other members in the state to let them know about Whitehouse's position.A request for comment from Whitehouse's office was not returned. It remains unclear when -- or if-- the Judiciary Committee will vote on Boggs. Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has signaled he will give Boggs a vote, but he has yet to set a date. If it doesn't happen by the end of the year, Boggs' nomination will expire and will have to be resubmitted by Obama next year, which is not by any means a certainty.The main reason Boggs got nominated in the first place is because he was part of an all-or-nothing package of seven judicial nominees Obama agreed upon with Georgia's Republican Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. All seven got hearings earlier this year, which was the deal Obama struck with the senators. Since then, the other six have cleared the committee, while only Boggs has been held up.Reached for comment, a Judiciary Committee spokeswoman said only that Leahy is continuing to discuss Boggs' nomination with members.UPDATE: 5:00 p.m. -- Despite the Roll Call report that said Whitehouse had indicated he would vote for Boggs' nomination, Whitehouse told The Huffington Post after this article was published that he hasn't made up his mind on how he'll vote, though he reiterated that he ""generally"" gives deference to home-state senators on their nominees.""I'm continuing to weigh my concerns about Mr. Boggs' record with my respect for this Senate principle, and have not made a decision about how I will vote,"" Whitehouse said in a statement.""I share the concerns of many about Michael Boggs' record as a legislator in Georgia, and I strongly disagree with many of the positions he has taken. For District Court vacancies, there is a long tradition in the Senate of deferring to the judgment of home state Senators, when both Senators agree on the nominee -- as is the case with Mr. Boggs. I have expected this deference when it comes to nominees in my own state, and I generally hold myself to the same standard to which I have held others.""A spokesman for Whitehouse did not immediately respond when asked if the Roll Call report was wrong."

Brooks Smith said the ban, the second in the country after California's, appropriately advanced New Jersey's legitimate interest in protecting people under the age of 18 from harmful or ineffective professional treatment.He also said New Jersey had shown that the potential harm from gay conversion therapy was ""not merely conjectural,"" reflecting concern by the American Psychiatric Association and other groups about such risks as anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.Lawmakers may ""rely on the empirical judgment of independent professional organizations that possess specialized knowledge and experience ... particularly when this community has spoken with such urgency and solidarity,"" wrote Smith, an appointee of President George W. Bush.The other judges on the panel were appointed by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder, but various conservative and religious groups have since argued that sexual orientation can be changed.Plaintiffs challenging the New Jersey ban included two counselors, the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, and the American Association of Christian Counselors.""Laws banning counseling in this area are simply unconstitutional violations of free speech,"" the plaintiffs' lawyer Mathew Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, said in a statement. He said there will be an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.Christie's office declined to comment, and the state attorney general's office had no immediate comment.The decision ""will do a lot of good for young people who are at great risk of harm from unscrupulous or misguided therapists,"" Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, a nonprofit advocating for rights of gay and transgender people, said in an interview. ""It validates the state's strong interest in preventing these snake-oil efforts.""Thursday's decision upheld a November ruling by U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in Trenton, New Jersey.The appeals court said Wolfson had erred in finding that New Jersey law regulated conduct and not speech, but said the law's limits on speech were ""not more extensive than necessary.""California Governor Jerry Brown signed that state's gay conversion therapy ban into law in 2012, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld it in August 2013.

Unlike previous saber rattling by Al Qaeda or even Pakistan, this latest threat is more dangerous because of its timing and agenda.",2014-09-10,"Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and India's next prime minister Narendra Modi attends a press conference at the party headquarters in New Delhi, India, Saturday, May 17, 2014. Thousands of cheering supporters welcomed Modi on his arrival in the capital Saturday after leading his party to a staggering victory in national elections. Modi and his BJP wiped out the Congress party that dominated Indian politics for all but a decade since the country gained freedom from British rule in 1947. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d988923b00006130ec9816.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the heels of the carnage spread by ISIS in Iraq and Syria, Al Qaeda released a video declaring the creation of a South Asian wing to wage terror in India. India, of course, has suffered from protracted religious strife between its native Muslims and Hindus, who outnumber the former by 6 to 1. The nation also has an uneasy relationship with its Muslim neighbor, Pakistan, factions of whose government continue to sponsor terrorism in the disputed territory of Kashmir and the mainland.Even though the U.S. has downplayed the threat posed by Al Qaeda, which has made such claims before, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be wise to take this particular instance more seriously. Unlike previous saber rattling by Al Qaeda or even Pakistan, this latest threat is more dangerous because of its timing and agenda.Dividing the Nation  Judging by its rhetoric, Al Qaeda is trying to take advantage of the staunchly Hindu foundation of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party to foment fear and suspicion amongst the Muslim community in India, and use this as a wedge to recruit and brainwash Muslims to the terrorist cause. While Modi has explicitly stated that he wants his government to be a unifying force for the nation, the ghost of the infamous Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat (which happened under his watch as Chief Minister of the state) and the stubbornly provincial mindset of some members of the BJP still leaves India vulnerable to division. Just as Middle Eastern terrorist groups have managed to recruit American and British Muslims by convincing them that their beliefs and values are being persecuted, Al Qaeda will try to instill alarm in the minds of Muslims in India that they can never attain equal status in a country where 81 percent of the population is Hindu and where, unfortunately, many Muslims still lack a decent standard of living. Derailing the Economy  This second factor, namely poverty, is actually even more important from Al Qaeda's perspective since it exacerbates the plight of Muslims in India and creates an environment that permits indoctrination and fundamentalism. This has, after all, been the model that terrorist organizations everywhere have used to grow their ranks over many decades, and which continues to be effective today. It is this status quo that Al Qaeda wants to preserve and why its leaders are acting out at this moment in time.India's new prime minister came to power this year on the back of an economic promise to the people of India. Long held back by inefficient government bureaucracy, anti-business regulations, and corruption, the Indian markets have been waiting for a capitalist renaissance that finally seems to be emerging due to the visionary government of Narendra Modi. Modi, a firm proponent of free markets, is gradually opening up the Indian business landscape to increased foreign investment and to private sector best practices, while also working to reduce corruption in the Indian government that has made it difficult for honest businesses to function profitably.These initiatives have already started to show an impact, with GDP accelerating to 5.7 percent in the second quarter and inflation trending down. Foreign direct investment in India in the six months leading up to Modi's election alone was $16 billion. What these statistics say is that India's economic reforms have a chance of success and can create a vibrant business landscape in the future. More importantly, rising economic prosperity will eventually help everyone, including the Muslims, to attain a better standard of living. This last is what scares Al Qaeda the most, as a better-off Muslim population will lead to better education and less dissatisfaction, and make it harder for the group to find foot soldiers amongst the community.This isn't farfetched. It is the simplicity and potential effectiveness of the ploy that makes it credible, and deadly. India's economic growth is dependent heavily on stability and visibility for the business community and foreign investors in particular. Terror attacks and the political instability that would accompany them can derail the nation's economic reforms at this nascent stage. That is what Al Qaeda wants and why it is imperative for the Indian government to put counter-terrorism actively on the agenda now instead of later -- when it would consume a much larger share of the administration's energy and resources, and divert its attention from the economy.India's Response  Broadly speaking, there are two things Modi must do, the first of which he is already doing -- which is taking an uncompromising stance with Pakistan on the issue of terrorism. The nexus between the terror group Lashkar-e-Toeba (LeT) and Pakistan's notoriously corrupt intelligence service, ISI, as well as the link between Al Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and LeT, are well established. Moreover, the political upheaval in Pakistan right now has put President Nawaz Sharif's civilian government on the firing line and reduced its ability to influence either the ISI or the military. A former CIA analyst who is now with the Brookings Institution has accused both the ISI and the military of deliberately targeting India for terror attacks in order to further decimate Sharif's credibility.In this landscape, Modi has to be exceptionally cautious in his dealings with Pakistan and step up security measures at home, keeping in mind that Al Qaeda's seemingly idle threat can get rocket fuel from sources within the Pakistani government and destabilize the core mission of his administration, which is to make India an economic powerhouse. The second thing the Modi government should do is create an active program of outreach to the Muslim community in India to help understand their problems and grievances, and take steps to address them. This is not going to be easy given the BJP's own Hindu roots, but will be essential to bring Muslims firmly into the fold of mainstream Indian life and reduce friction based on religion between otherwise compatible communities.In the long run, smoother relations between Hindus and Muslims as well as the tide of a robust economy will lift all religious boats and put the Muslims in India out of the reach of radicalization by groups like Al Qaeda or LeT. That may not be guaranteed but is still a very worthwhile goal for the Modi administration to pursue.  Sanjay Sanghoee is an Indian author.

Tim Nichols (U.S.M.C. Ret.)As people who have been studying and, at times, directly involved in, counter-terrorism efforts in the U.S. since 9/11, we have been disappointed in the over-hyped public reaction to the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The key goal of U.S. counter-terrorism policy over the past 13 years -- preventing a large-scale terrorist attack inside of America -- has been achieved. ISIS undoubtedly presents a new and dangerous threat, but the organization clearly does not constitute an existential threat to the U.S. homeland. The hysteria over ISIS in the media and our sensational political dialogue is unjustified and unhelpful. This rhetoric attributes undue stature to a regional collection of fanatical insurgents. Let's take a deep breath and confront ISIS in a thoughtful, deliberate manner. It is surely unsettling to see waves of heavily armed extremists sweeping across swaths of Iraq and committing gruesome atrocities, especially the beheading of American journalists and the mass executions of religious minorities. But let's be clear. This is happening more than 6,000 miles away. Of course, the ease of global travel shrinks the world and creates a security vulnerability for the U.S. But over the past decade there have been thousands of radical extremists lurking in dark corners of the world with a deep desire to attack America. None of them have been successful in executing an attack inside our borders. The fact that as many as 100 ISIS fighters may hold American passports increases our risk. But we have a large counterterrorism enterprise focused like a laser beam on this problem. It cannot drive the risk to zero, but a combination of electronic surveillance, working with regional allies, and border security can substantially mitigate the likelihood and severity of any potential ISIS attack by radicalized U.S. citizens. What we cannot do is let fear and hyperbole lead us into the trap that ISIS is setting for us. Like al Qaeda before it, ISIS is eager to draw America into a conflict in the Middle East and satisfy its bloodlust on American targets in its own backyard. An exclusively American air campaign, or, worse yet, American troops marching through the heart of the Middle East, would reinforce the extremists' worldview that the mighty Christian and Jewish West is dedicated to the destruction of Islam. So, while President Obama has been deservedly criticized for being too slow to recognize the ISIS threat, his instinct about the need to build an international coalition is absolutely correct. Rash, unilateral action by the U.S. would undercut this effort. It would wrongly relieve the pressure on countries in the region to work with us on the ISIS problem. We can't forget that the security interests of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and our NATO allies are threatened by ISIS to a much greater extent than our own. We should insist that they step forward, provide people and resources to the fight, and, most importantly, publicly align with the emerging anti-ISIS coalition. We will be in a far better situation if we are overtly fighting with Muslims against ISIS (think the first Iraq War), than if America is seen as intervening in the Middle East against Muslims yet again (think the second Iraq War).We have seen some progress, but also plenty of foot-dragging, among regional actors. Although Iraq has a new prime minister, its factions are still moving at a glacial pace toward forming a new government despite the mortal threat that ISIS poses to Iraq's very existence. The dithering needs to end and concessions to the Iraqi Sunnis and Kurds have to take place now, not in six months or a year when it will be too late. Saudi Arabia and Qatar need to stop funding and arming Sunni extremist groups in Syria and direct their full attention to crushing ISIS. Iran and the Assad regime are not going to be overt members of the coalition, but there is no reason for us to take care of their ISIS problem so they can pursue other agendas directly contrary to our interests. They must get the message that we expect them to direct their firepower at ISIS too. We should also insist that our European allies shoulder a fair share of the burden. After all, there are perhaps hundreds of Americans fighting in Syria and Iraq; there are thousands of Europeans there and these fighters can literally drive from the conflict to the E.U. border. To be sure, the situation on the ground has become sufficiently dire to justify U.S. airstrikes against ISIS targets. These will be especially effective in places where ISIS is massing troops and equipment in either Iraq or Syria. Such strikes will blunt ISIS's momentum and give the emerging coalition time to organize, muster resources, and take the offensive.But this problem will not be solved with U.S. airstrikes or exclusively through the use of force. A regional military and political solution will be required. This will not come about if the U.S. military charges into the region promising to destroy ISIS without developing a genuine coalition and demanding that the coalition partners both contribute militarily and make the concessions necessary to address the political grievances that are fueling the ISIS rampage. Our long-term security interests are best served by framing the conflict with both ISIS and al Qaeda as a fight between a unified, multinational, interethnic coalition of civilized nations against a group of militant radicalized barbarians. So let's cool down the rhetoric (especially the quasi-religious references to the ""gates of hell""), beef up what we need to do to protect the homeland from returning fighters, and build an enduring coalition to confront ISIS and other extremist organizations.Lt.

16,WORLDPOST,You're Probably Not Asking Enough Questions About U.S. Military Action Against ISIS,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/questions-isis-campaign_n_5786816.html,,2014-09-10,"FILE - In this Aug. 28, 2014 file photo, President Barack Obama speaks in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, before convening a meeting with his national security team on the militant threat in Syria and Iraq. The U.S. and its allies are trying to hammer out a coalition to push back the Islamic State group in Iraq. But any serious attempt to destroy the militants or even seriously degrade their capabilities means targeting their infrastructure in Syria. That, however, is far more complicated. If it launches airstrikes against the group in Syria, the U.S. runs the risk of unintentionally strengthening the hand of President Bashar Assad, whose removal the West has actively sought the past three years. Uprooting the Islamic State, which has seized swaths of territory in both Syria and Iraq, would potentially open the way for the Syrian army to fill the vacuum. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d022600005300709d15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama is set to lay out in a speech tonight his ""game plan"" for an expanded assault on the Islamic State, the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL. He is expected to explain how the ongoing airstrike campaign against the group in Iraq will be expanded with international support, and reports suggest that he will advocate for a long-term commitment against the group, which has killed thousands in the region and caused alarm in America by executing two U.S. journalists. But experts warn the White House must offer more than a just a battle plan: It should make a case for a broader military campaign that can survive rigorous questioning, so we can be sure it won't simply exacerbate regional instability the way previous U.S. intervention has done. And as the campaign against the Islamic State eventually extends into Syria -- something administration aides say it must do to target the heart of the group -- Obama will be involving America's military in a conflict in which actors from across the region are using their armed proxies to fight for diverse interests.So the administration needs to prove that its approach won't be reactive or short-sighted. Here are some of the most important questions White House advisers, and the nation on whose behalf they could soon launch more missiles, should be considering ahead of Obama's speech:Does the Islamic State threaten Americans at home?We're still not sure about this -- and the administration seems to have its own doubts. Despite Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's assertion in August that the Islamic State is ""an imminent threat to every interest we have,"" National Counterterrorism Center director Matthew Olsen said as recently as last week that the most the Islamic State is capable of doing to the U.S. is launching a plan ""limited in scope … nothing like a 9/11 scale attack."" The administration certainly must do everything it can to defend Americans against any potential attack. But the White House has yet to be clear on the exact way in which the Islamic State could harm Americans at home. As it explains this, it should remember what Dave Weigel points out at Slate: It's easy to overrate an enemy. Do we really know what kind of threat the Islamic State poses, and are we reacting in proportion to it?In an interview with Dan Froomkin for The Intercept, retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor pointed out that the group's success in capturing territory is not proof of its strength, but of the weakness of local governments. It's obvious, then, that the Islamic State threatens fragile states like Jordan and Lebanon -- but far less clear that it poses a risk to a global superpower thousands of miles and an ocean away.So why do we care? To former CIA Middle East analyst Paul Pillar, writing in the National Interest, the national discussion about the Islamic State seems fueled less by actual concern than by how the group makes America feel. Are we expanding the attack because we are worried, or because, having seen some of our own citizens suffer, we are angry? Is fury enough to justify ever-increasing U.S. action -- and if it is, do we really want to demonstrate as much to other, smaller jihadi groups looking to prove themselves by forcing America's hand? To what extent does the Islamic State threaten U.S. interests abroad, and can we defend them?It's unclear that America's regional allies are on the same page regarding the threat ISIS poses. Jordan, a potentially threatened nation with ties to Washington, arrested some domestic Islamist activists last week and may be concerned behind closed doors -- but there is debate there over whether the battle against ISIS is really Jordan's war. Meanwhile, Israel is sharing its intelligence with the U.S. but overtly has done little more than declare the group illegal -- possibly because it believes the group has not prioritized attacking Israel. The administration's case must make sense of these mixed signals: Does Obama really believe ISIS could harm our partners?And even if U.S. sources indicate there is a strong threat to regional order, why should we believe that further American-led action there will do anything to preserve it? After a decade of ambitious U.S. nation-building, extremist groups like the Islamic State are thriving in the Middle East. Will this intervention really be different? And if so, in what specific ways?If the administration tries to convince Americans that airstrikes in Syria stem from a U.S. interest in protecting the region's residents, it will face skepticism. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has massacred tens of thousands of his own people while facing minimal consequences. If Obama believes he once again has the kind of ""responsibility to protect"" argument used as a basis for action in Libya in 2011, how will he explain his choice not to act when faced with suffering in Syria over the past three and a half years? How will the campaign work?Obama said Sunday that he envisions a continued airstrike campaign to support Iraqi and Kurdish troops. That leaves the world unsure about who will own this assault. Will it be a U.S. responsibility, or one entrusted to local partners? As Zack Beauchamp notes at Vox, ""there's a risk that the U.S. is sending mixed messages to the Iraqis and Syrians. The more America talks about wanting to destroy ISIS, the more Iraqis and Syrians think the U.S. might be planning to take the military and political lead."" The White House faces a struggle here: It wants to take the lead in countering a threat it paints as critical, while ensuring local actors are invested in the campaign. And those local actors have their own prejudices and ambitions. Reuters reports that anti-Islamic State fighters in Iraq, who are Kurdish or Shiite, are already making life difficult for Sunni refugees. Who will hold Kurdish peshmerga commanders and others accountable, and how can we be sure that their actions -- or the favors we may concede to win their support -- will not clash with U.S. interests and policy in the region?  How will the campaign affect the power structure in the Middle East?Iraq war critic and Boston University professor Andrew Bacevich told HuffPost last week that the debate (or lack thereof) around attacking the Islamic State has missed the point: ""It seems unlikely that U.S. military action, even if assisted by surrogates on the ground, can 'kill' ISIS. At best, we will be able to significantly reduce its capabilities. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but then what?"" His question resonates beyond the territory we're presumably helping to snatch back from the Islamic State. Does the White House have a strategy for how ramped-up U.S. intervention would fit into the broader power struggle in the Middle East?The big-picture problem is the fractured nature of Middle Eastern politics. Factions in various countries are fighting for Sunni or Shiite dominance, backed by Sunni and Shiite regional powers (notably Saudi Arabia and Iran). As it seeks to undermine the Islamic State, the White House wants to win over Sunnis who see ISIS as an effective opponent against Shiite-dominated governments. But why should these Sunnis believe the U.S. will guarantee them future political representation? Sunni leaders already are wary of American promises after suffering in Iraq under U.S.-approved Shiite leader Nouri al-Maliki.Again, this comes down to promises: Who are we helping to empower in the region? While the White House might rally Shiites and Sunnis against the Islamic State temporarily, who will it eventually let down? Attacking ISIS would indirectly help Syria's Shiite-backed regime -- is America willing to frustrate Sunnis further by doing so? What would 'winning' look like here?Here's the larger question: Is the U.S. willing to commit to a long-term plan to ease tension on either side of the Syria-Iraq border? Airstrikes with some local support -- the policy Obama referred to Sunday when talking about counterterrorism efforts over the past few years -- have not destroyed the Pakistani Taliban or left us with a functional Libya. Perhaps a deeper U.S. engagement could have done that. But this isn't what the president says he's requesting. Counterterrorism researcher Brian Fishman warns the administration and its critics that they need to be clearer about what the U.S. wants to do to the Islamic State -- and to the region:Advocating the defeat of ISIL over the short-term without acknowledging what will be necessary to achieve that end is a recipe for mission creep. This is the most important strategic lesson from Iraq: Don’t bullshit the American people into a war with shifting objectives (even if those goals are important) because they will not put up with that commitment long enough for those goals to be achieved. This is not a call for pacifism; it is a call for fighting to win, which requires sustained commitment, which requires forthrightness in our discourse about whether to choose war. We should only fight if we are fighting to win.Is the White House trying to ""win"" by building a Middle East that does not produce and harbor groups like the Islamic State? Does it have a plan to do this? How much would it cost to 'win'?With the broadening of the U.S. effort, logistics are key. What will this mission end up costing the American taxpayer? The current campaign against the Islamic State already requires $225 million a month. That number is set to rise, but do we want it to? The ""we"" here is especially important. Does the desire for higher spending come from strategists looking to accomplish a long-term strategic goal or hawks with an inherent love of, and interest in, military expenditure? And will that money get us the world we want or just fuel more eventual trouble? Could U.S. military intervention actually strengthen the Islamic State?If the U.S. ends up responding to an overblown threat assessment, it could actually make the Islamic State more powerful. In effect, Obama may be giving the extremists the attention they crave -- and setting us up for a longer headache. Matthew Hoh at the Center for International Policy made this point on HuffPost this week, noting an infamous boast Osama bin Laden made about his ability to draw disproportionate U.S. responses -- and cause disproportionate U.S. pain -- with even the most meager al Qaeda advance:In our rush to return to war in Iraq we are playing into the Islamic State's hands, just as we played into the hands of al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004 and into Osama bin Laden's larger strategy with our morally disastrous Global War on Terror, including the invasion of Iraq in 2003, in reaction to the 9/11 attacks.And a New Republic piece from this summer notes that given the competition for supremacy among extremist groups, ""a massive invasion by the United States …[could] instantly convert [Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al] Baghdadi’s squalid army into the world’s premier terrorist organization."" Is Obama willing to face the risk that military action could give the Islamic State a boost in its effort to displace al Qaeda in the pursuit of allies, recruits, funding and high-profile successes -- and to help ISIS become a more resilient, long-lasting threat? Can we ever defeat a problem rooted in complex, longstanding frustrations?This is a question that predates the Obama administration, but it goes to the core assumptions of our current military plan and has implications beyond American involvement in an ongoing sectarian war. No airstrike can destroy the twisted logic that sustains groups like the Islamic State. Islamic extremists in the Middle East and elsewhere see the U.S. as incapable of making a moral case against violent jihad: While beheadings are awful, their logic goes, so too was Abu Ghraib. So while the vast majority of Muslims do not want to live under gruesome Sharia law or be represented by a self-appointed caliph, thousands seem ready to tolerate the group as an actor fighting what they see as an unfair status quo. Those numbers include Syrians exhausted from civil war and disillusioned with an uncaring world, and the oft-mentioned Western-born fighters seeking glory or a sense of community they cannot find at home.What the White House should be looking to answer, then, is a question posed by former ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr.: ""Is there any non-coercive program to counter the ideological appeal of ISIS?""The State Department's Think Again Turn Away Twitter account tries to do this by using Islamic State hashtags to send out messages touting U.S. success or undercutting Islamic State accomplishments. For a longterm strategy and investment to reap a reward, simply reacting to new threats will never be enough. What else could the U.S. and its regional partners be doing?  _________________Given that it is gambling with America's money and global stature, not to mention hundreds of thousands of lives, the White House should be fully aware of what the long campaign against the Islamic State might entail. Come Wednesday night, the president will have a chance to answer the difficult questions listed above -- and to convince the world that his plan accounts for them."

He also noted that President Barack Obama will be giving a speech Wednesday night outlining his plan to ""degrade and destroy ISIL as part of a broad international community.""Johnson outlined five steps that the Department of Homeland Security is taking to combat the Islamic State and other terrorist threats:1. Increasing aviation security, especially at overseas airportsJohnson said that he has overseen an enhanced screening process since July at about 25 oversees airports that offer direct flights to the U.S. ""I’d much rather defend our end zone from the 50-yard line than from our 1-yard line,"" he said.2. Stepping up efforts to track Syrian fighters who seek to enter the U.S.Johnson said that there are more than 12,000 fighters who have traveled to Syria over the last three years, including more than 1,000 Europeans and more than 100 Americans. ""Not only may these foreign fighters join ISIL, they may also be recruited by these extremist groups to leave Syria and conduct external attacks,"" he said.The FBI has arrested a number of individuals who have tried to travel from the U.S. to Syria to support terrorist activities, Johnson added.3. Improving information sharing with other governments to track foreign fighters in SyriaUnder the U.S. visa waiver program, citizens from 38 approved countries can travel to the U.S. for 90 days without a visa. Johnson said that the U.S. is enhancing information sharing with these countries because some of them have a large number of citizens who are fighting in Syria.He added that DHS is reviewing safeguards in the U.S. visa waiver program and encouraging more countries to join the U.S. in using advanced screening tools, such as systems that maintain a record of passenger names.
