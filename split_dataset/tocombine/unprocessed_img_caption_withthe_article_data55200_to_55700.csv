At least one of the tanker cars burst into flames.Officials said on Saturday that 16 cars of a 96-car train had derailed and four caught fire. The derailment occurred near Mosier, a small town east of Portland, around noon local time. About 100 residents of Mosier remained under an evacuation order Saturday.It is not yet clear how much crude was released.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) said about 4 p.m. that there were no reports of oil entering the Columbia River. Maia Bellon, director of the Washington Department of Ecology, also said there were no signs of oil in the river.But black smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the nearby town of Mosier, Oregon. The scene was also captured by several nearby webcams.There were no initial reports of injuries, although students were evacuated from an area school as a precaution. The derailment also forced the closure of Interstate 84, causing backups.The cars derailed about 20 feet from the Mosier's sewage plant, Mayor Arlene Burns told The Oregonian. ""We've been saying for a long time that it's not fair for trains with toxic loads to come into our towns near our Gorge,"" Burns said. ""We don't have the capacity to fight these fires.""The cause of the derailment was unclear, as was how fast the train was traveling.The train was traveling from Eastport, Idaho, to Tacoma, Washington, carrying Bakken crude, Hunt said.Emergency crews from multiple agencies were responding. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) said she was aware of the situation and was ready to make every state resource available.The fire was out by Saturday, but an oil sheen has been discovered on the Columbia River, according to Maia Bellon, director of the Washington Department of Ecology.There have been at least 26 major oil-train derailments or fires across the U.S. and Canada in the past decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. Transporting oil is an especially hot topic in the Northwest. “Today’s derailment of a train carrying Bakken crude oil in the Columbia River Gorge is yet another reminder of the risks and concerns of crude-by-rail transport in our region,"" Gov. Inslee said Friday.Lena Moffitt, director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, took a critical tone as well.“History has repeatedly shown just how deadly and dangerous oil train crashes can be,"" Moffitt said in a statement. ""Simply put, transporting oil by rail -- or by any method -- is a disaster waiting to happen. The safety and wellbeing of our communities must be put ahead of profits for Big Oil.”In May, hundreds of activists protested at oil refineries and blocked railroad lines in Washington state. An icebreaker on an oil-drilling expedition was met by protesters dangling from Portland's bridges and paddling kayaks in the Willamette River when it passed through on its way to the ocean.This article has been updated with details of the fire and the oil spill."

The brothers have been in custody since their arrest in January. But at Multnomah County Detention Center, they’ve got demands: Ryan Bundy wants to see his brother. He feels his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms has been violated. He doesn't want people rifling through his stuff. Both have said they want access to the internet, including Facebook and email, in order to prepare their defense. They want chairs in their cells so they don't have to kneel to write, a better computer, a cordless printer, a scanner, external hard drives and Microsoft Movie Editor. They also want to strategize with the other occupiers involved in the armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge near Burns, Oregon, for which they face federal conspiracy and other charges.""If they are going to detain us as innocent men, then they are obligated to afford us the rights to defend ourselves and emotionally connect to our families,"" Ammon Bundy told The Huffington Post in an email sent by one of his attorneys, Mike Arnold. Bundy also called jail ""a job programs for more government employees rather than a system that brings justice and fair due process."" The Bundys aren't big on government rules they don't believe in. They took over the federal property to protest the imprisonment of two ranchers, Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven, who were convicted of arson, imprisoned, released and then resentenced to longer terms. They were also were protesting federal land stewardship, an issue their father, Cliven Bundy, raised by refusing to pay the government more than $1 million in grazing fees. The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office has denied most of the Bundy brothers’ requests, according to a court document filed last week. That's not surprising: Jails across the country generally don't grant inmates these privileges. But Arnold, Ammon Bundy's attorney, says they should.""Name me one 'exception' that can’t be accommodate[d] by a forward thinking criminal justice system that cares about due process and fair trials,"" he told HuffPost.Some of the brothers' requests are fairly standard, like accommodations for religious practice and unmonitored attorney calls.

But inmates across the United States could benefit from internet access, even if they're not famous -- as advocates have been saying for years.""Giving prisoners access to computers, access to email and some access to the internet, with necessary restrictions, is a very positive thing,"" said David Fathi, director of the ACLU's National Prison Project. Some prisoners have access to electronic messaging services offered by for-profit companies, but these systems can cost as much as $1.25 per message, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that campaigns for prison reform. In some institutions, inmates have access to legal information through services like Westlaw. But these resources may not be sufficient for inmates who are preparing for a criminal case, particularly if they are defending themselves (Ryan Bundy is representing himself and has a stand-by counsel.)If pretrial inmates had internet access, then perhaps there wouldn't be situations like the one at Rikers Island jail in New York City where a man spent five months in jail because he didn't know his bail was set at just $2. In a court filing, Ammon Bundy's lawyers point out the computer in the detention center’s library is manually updated, does not have a word processing program and does not allow inmates to save documents. To remedy these issues, the jail has said it would consider allowing attorneys to load legal documents on iPads that the Bundys could have in their cells. But some of the evidence the federal government has brought against the defendants in the Oregon case relies on social media postings that the government says are evidence of a conspiracy to impede federal officers. The Bundys argue that they need access to social networks to defend themselves against those charges. Prison reform advocates say the internet is an important tool for prisoners after they're convicted, too, because it facilitates education, job training and staying in touch with friends and family -- all factors that promote rehabilitation. Alex Friedmann, associate director of the Human Rights Defense Center, which publishes Prison Legal News, said he supports monitoring inmates’ computer use for security reasons -- so they can't look up ""how to escape prison 101"" or ""how to build a bomb in your cellblock"" -- but that the benefits of access outweigh the risks. Authorities are already struggling to keep up with the thriving black market for smartphones. In 2013 alone, Florida's correction department seized 4,200 mobile phones from state prisons, according to Fusion. It doesn't look like inmates, including the Bundys, will be getting access to internet anytime soon. According to the court filing, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office noted that providing unmonitored internet access ""would be a substantial threat to facility security"" and the jail does not have the staff or resources to monitor it. There's also no precedent for granting this kind of exception. ""We do not have internet access for any of our jail inmates, nor have we ever provided it,"" said Capt.

The doctoral candidate in anthropology ended up delving into the sex lives of Japanese men, which spurred a slightly awkward reaction from the show's host. ""I think there's a lot of claims going around that Japanese men don't have sex and, um, am I allowed to say that?"" Miles said, laughing, before Trebek assured her she could continue. ""I mean I wasn't doing that kind of research, but I found, you know, it depends on how we define sex."" Trebek played it pretty cool, vaguely answering, ""Okay it always, it always comes around to that, doesn't it."" Nailed it, Alex.

Just yesterday, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton chastised Trump for his seemingly willful ignorance on issues of national importance, censuring him for using his platform to spread ill-informed, idle and fear-mongering threats.But his supporters have been stalwart, sticking by Trump despite his oft-radical rhetoric -- and in spite of his series of missteps on the campaign trail. But speaking to a crowd in San Jose, California, on Thursday night -- just about 35 miles from Oracle Arena -- Trump made one specific gaff that hit very close to home for the Golden State crowd.He referred to the Warriors as a team from San Francisco.“I said to my people, ‘What the hell are you doing? Who’s gonna come tonight?’ You have San Francisco playing the game tonight! And look at this crowd. This is unbelievable.”Of course, by “the game” he meant the opening contest of the NBA Finals. And by “San Francisco” he meant the Golden State Warriors, who actually play in Oakland. Big difference -- just ask anyone from the northern half of the state.On the scale of presidential importance, knowing the names of the leading NBA teams ranks very, very low. But considering the sky-high popularity of Stephen Curry and the Warriors these past two years, such a blunder speaks to the empty blustering that has characterized his campaign.Game 2 is on Sunday. “San Francisco” leads the series, 1-0."

It's still an absurdist comedy, so the cathartic bit happens as the two shout their feelings while repeatedly riding a roller coaster in Florida, but even so, the scene managed to leave viewers with a sweeter aftertaste.If ""Kimmy"" star Jane Krakowski -- who plays the bougie former Mrs. Voorhees -- is correct, the next season could bring fans even more oddly touching moments.""I actually wrote Robert Carlock after watching Episode 13, and I was like, 'Wow, now I feel like we can go to a whole 'nother place in Season 3,"" Krakowski, who was in New York as part of her new role as the Honorary Good Humor Woman, told The Huffington Post.""I think the show shifted a little bit, tonally, in Season 2, and I feel like that was from the cliffhanger of Episode 13 of Season 1, and I feel like they did the same thing for Season 3 -- they brought us to another depth where all the characters can go.""Krakowski's Jacqueline Voorhees also evolved from her Season 1 desperate-housewife schtick, turning back to (try, and fail, but keep trying to) support her Lakota family and connect with her son. In that way, the actress sees her ""Kimmy Schmidt"" role as fundamentally different than the character she played on ""30 Rock"" -- the similarly image-obsessed Jenna Maroney. Describing her as something of an ""artisan"" and ""limited edition, fat-free sorbet,"" Krakowski said that Jacqueline ""is far more grounded and vulnerable and actually trying to learn how to be a better person than Jenna would ever even consider.""Yet it's OK if you can't help but draw comparisons between the Netflix series about a former doomsday cult member struggling with life in New York and the NBC series about an overstressed late-night show writer struggling with life in New York. Both ""Kimmy Schmidt"" and ""30 Rock,"" as Tina-Fey-and-Robert-Carlock-produced comedies, share the same joke-dense style of writing that asks fans to revisit it again and again, each time picking out subtle new references we'd missed the first time around.We asked Krakowski whether she could immediately pick out every joke in the scripts or -- like us -- she had to give it a couple passes. Her answer made us feel better:""When we're working on the scripts, I think I do miss a lot of the jokes the first time around. Or I think I know there's something there, and then you see it come more to fruition as we are filming it. But I love that that's their style,"" Krakowski said. ""If there's, like, a TV on, the scroll on the bottom is all written with jokes and the fictional entities and storylines ... or the callbacks to previous episodes or even '30 Rock.'""BRB, we have some TV to watch."

Schwartz is slated to join fellow composer Jeanine Tesori, along with a bevy of musical theater talents, at New York's Cutting Room on June 13 as part of a benefit concert aimed at fighting House Bill 2. ""Broadway Voices for NC"" will feature performances by Tony Award winner Beth Leavel, ""Hamilton"" singer-actress Ariana Debose, Melvin Tunstall of ""Beautiful: The Carole King Musical"" and Lindsay Northen from ""Wicked."" Most of the evening's stars originally hail from North Carolina. The night will include a keynote speech by transgender advocate Vivian Taylor, who is also a Tar Heel State native, and will be hosted by model and activist Geena Rocero. ""Broadway Voices for NC"" was organized by Broadway performers Laurel Harris and Rob Marnell, both of whom are Raleigh natives. The couple met while performing in a production of ""Cinderella"" at Raleigh Little Theatre and say they remain close to their North Carolina roots. Harris, who has been seen in ""Wicked"" and the 2012 revival of ""Evita,"" told The Huffington Post that she sees the show as an opportunity to ""introduce the world to the North Carolina I know."" Her home state, she said, is vastly different from what the media has portrayed in the wake of HB 2. ""It's easy to feel powerless,"" she said. ""I wanted to create a story about North Carolina that we could actually be proud of, and to get Gov. McCrory's attention in the process. By having Stephen jump on board, along with Jeanine Tesori and other incredible Broadway performers -- most of whom are fellow North Carolinians -- we thought we could send a very powerful message all the way from New York."" Both Harris and Marnell hope the message of ""Broadway Voices for NC"" will resound beyond the Big Apple, so they've opted to donate proceeds from the show to Equality North Carolina, a local LGBT advocacy organization, as well as other queer-relevant groups whose members have been affected by HB 2. Harris said she ""applauds"" Schwartz and other show business figures who have scrapped performances in North Carolina since the passage of the bill, but also understands that canceled shows only end up hurting many people who don't support anti-LGBT legislation. As to what she'd tell McCrory if she had the chance, she said, ""Please stop deciding which individuals have rights and which don’t. I want to be a proud North Carolinian again and as long as this bill is in effect, I am ashamed and embarrassed to call myself one."" ""Broadway Voices for NC"" plays New York's Cutting Room on June 13. Head here for more information. "

No, he’s not a physicist or cosmologist ― playing an astronaut in “The Martian” doesn’t count ― but, again, this is MIT we’re talking about. Damon suggested that even if the world were fake, it would still need people to make it a better place.“What if this, all of this, is a simulation?” Damon asked. He isn’t a physicist or cosmologist ― though he did play an astronaut in “The Martian” ― but his thoughtful response was oddly uplifting. Even if the world is fake, it would still need people to make it a better place.“Real or imagined, this world has some problems that we need you to drop everything and solve,” Damon said. “So go ahead. Take your pick from the world’s worst buffet.”He then went on to list some of society’s most pressing issues ― economic inequality, the refugee crisis, institutional racism ― before saying “there is more at stake today than in every story that has ever been told.” The “Good Will Hunting” actor, who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, specifically called out Donald Trump, much to the delight of the audience. “If there are multiple simulations, how come we have to be in the one where Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee for president?” Damon said to massive applause. (We wonder the same thing.)Damon joked that he didn't really deserve to be MIT's commencement speaker, saying: ""I mean, I've seen the list of previous commencement speakers. And who did you get? The guy who did the voice for a cartoon horse."" (He voiced the main character of 2002's ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron."")But the actor was actually the perfect choice for MIT. He and his BFF Ben Affleck (""a brilliant guy, a good guy, never really amounted to much"") grew up in the university's neighborhood.""We all grew up right here in Central Square, children of the sometimes rocky marriage between this city and its great institutions,"" he said. ""To us, MIT was kind of like the Man -- this big impressive, impersonal force.""Damon also took a moment to reveal the inspiration behind the famous blackboard scene in ""Good Will Hunting,"" which was set at MIT.""My brother, who's an artist, picked up some chalk and wrote an incredibly elaborate, totally fake version of an equation,"" he said. ""It was so cool and completely insane that no one erased it for months."" Damon's brother Kyle didn't actually solve that math equation and the actor is not a real-life savant, but his commencement speech was spot-on.""This is your life, class of 2016,"" Damon said.

Pat McCrory (R) signed HB 2 into law in March, with the swish of a pen, he overturned all of the state's local ordinances that protected lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from being discriminated against.But there was another consequence to the sweeping anti-LGBT law: It wiped out local anti-discrimination protections for veterans, too.Two jurisdictions in North Carolina -- Greensboro and Orange County -- had ordinances in place that barred job discrimination against vets. These types of protections trace back to the Vietnam War, when vets couldn't get work as a result of their military service. In more recent years, veterans' advocates have raised concerns about Iraq and Afghanistan War vets being turned away from jobs because of employers' fears, unfounded as they may be, that they suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and would be emotionally unstable on the job.McCrory eliminated those two local ordinances for veterans when he signed HB 2. The law also ensures that cities and counties can't pass these kinds of protections going forward.That's not sitting right with some members of Congress who served overseas.""While rooted in hostility toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, HB 2 also preempts municipal non-discrimination protections for veterans and the men and women of our Armed Services,"" reads a letter sent to McCrory this week, signed by eight House Democrats who are also veterans.""By signing HB 2 into law you legalized discrimination against North Carolinians who put their lives on the line in service to our country,"" it continues. ""As fellow veterans, we believe this law and your actions are unconscionable. We urge you to support the immediate repeal of HB 2.""Lawmakers on the letter include Democratic Reps. Seth Moulton (Mass.), a Marine vet who served in Iraq; John Conyers (Mich.), who served in the Army during the Korean War; Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), a Marine vet who served in Iraq; Ted Lieu (Calif.), who is in the Air Force reserves; Jim McDermott (Wash.), who served in the Navy during the Vietnam War; Jose Serrano (N.Y.), who served in the Army; Mark Takai (Hawaii), who is in the Army National Guard; and Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who served in the Army during the Iraq War.There's still a federal law that bans discrimination against military vets. But if you're an Iraq War vet who lives in Greensboro and you think you're being turned away from jobs because of your military background, you can't seek a remedy at the state level anymore. You'd have to go through the federal system, which costs more and is more complicated.McCrory's press office did not respond to a request for comment."

More than 2,000 people have died.Greek authorities said 340 people were rescued, but four bodies were also recovered in a location some 75 nautical miles off southern Crete, in territory which falls under Egypt's search and rescue jurisdiction.There was no immediate word on how many people may be missing and Greek coastguard officials refused to speculate. Greek media carried unsourced accounts the vessel was carrying anything between 500 and 700 people. It was not immediately clear where the boat had sailed from.""From some scattered accounts we have heard (from those rescued) they set off from the African coastline,"" coastguard spokesman Nikos Lagkadianos told Reuters.Merchant ships sailing in the area assisted in the operation, with about 242 people rescued taken to Italy and others to Egypt, Turkey and Malta, the Greek coastguard said.Hundreds of thousands of mainly Syrian refugees crossed the short but precarious sea corridor to Greece from Turkey last year in small inflatable boats, but that route was effectively sealed after an EU-Turkey clampdown in March.Now, warm weather and calmer seas in the Mediterranean have led to a surge in recent weeks in the number of people trying to cross to Italy from Libya, where people-smugglers operate with relative impunity.Boats on this much longer journey risk being blown off course to islands such as Crete.

Harambe was ultimately fatally shot by the zoo's staff after he picked up the boy.Maynard said at a press conference that the zoo did not use tranquilizers because the drugs would take too long to take effect.Maynard said while the zoo was ""devastated"" by Harambe's death, ""we were very glad the little boy is OK.

In her letter, Goodall referred to a famous incident from 1996 at the Chicago-area Brookfield Zoo that had vaguely similar circumstances -- but a much different ending.At that time, a 3-year-old boy fell into the zoo's gorilla enclosure and was knocked unconscious. Binti Jua, an 8-year-old western lowland gorilla, gently scooped up the boy and tended to him before carrying him to the exit door where zookeepers intervened. Zookeepers told CBS Chicago at the time that it was fortunate the child was unconscious when he fell, as the gorilla may have perceived a distressed or crying child as threatening. "

And it's why it's incumbent on news organizations to challenge him when he repeats claims that have already been debunked.But on Wednesday, The New York Times allowed Trump to again assert he opposed the Iraq War without any qualification, despite numerous fact-checks finding no evidence to support it.In an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton’s early support for the Iraq war, which he said he opposed, and questioned her judgment in Libya. “Bernie Sanders said it and I’m going to use it all over the place because it’s true,” Mr. Trump said. “She is a woman who is ill-suited to be president because she has bad judgment.”Trump has repeatedly said he was an early critic of the Iraq War, a claim meant to suggest he had more foreign policy vision than his political rivals, from Republican primary candidates to the likely Democratic nominee. But fact-checkers have been looking for evidence for nearly a year and have consistently come up empty-handed.During the first Republican debate, in August, Trump cited a July 2004 article as evidence he opposed the war before it began, even though the U.S. invaded Iraq 16 months earlier, in March 2003. The Times fact-checked Trump's statement in real time, and said it ""left out the reality that his opposition came well after the war was already underway.""The Huffington Post searched newspaper and TV archives in September and found no evidence Trump publicly opposed the war before the 2003 invasion. A week later, during the second Republican debate, Trump said there were ""25 different stories"" that showed he did. None have been found. Trump continued making the claim in TV interviews throughout the fall. When he did so in a December debate, the Times again noted that his public opposition to the war came long after it started. Trump was seriously pressed on the Iraq issue on TV earlier this year and couldn't back up his claim.BuzzFeed's Andrew Kaczynski, who has closely tracked Trump's shifting statements on Iraq, even found the presumptive Republican nominee tepidly supporting the invasion in a September 2002 interview with Howard Stern. Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post's ""Fact-checker"" columnist, criticized TV news hosts last month for continuing to allow Trump to say he opposed the war without qualification.""There is no excuse for this,"" Kessler wrote. ""TV hosts should have a list of Trump’s repeated misstatements so that if he repeats them, as he often does, he can be challenged on his claims.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

At 3 p.m. EST, they got their answer by way of the Janesville Gazette. The 20,000-circulation newspaper had a big advantage over the better-resourced Washington press corps given that Ryan is from Janesville, Wisconsin. “We’re his hometown paper, so that’s why he came to us,” editor Sid Schwartz told HuffPost. Though the speaker’s office told Schwartz they were going to send him a column on Thursday, he didn't know it was a Trump endorsement. Ryan was already scheduled to meet with The Gazette’s editorial board Friday, and Schwartz said he thought the column could have been related to an issue the congressman hoped to address at the meeting. The Gazette received Ryan's column Thursday morning under embargo to publish that afternoon.The Ryan endorsement news coincided with Hillary Clinton giving a major foreign policy address, and immediately consumed the conversation among political journalists on Twitter. The decision to drop the endorsement with Clinton on stage was interpreted differently, from a way to one-up the Democratic front-runner to an attempt to bury the news. Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck told HuffPost in an email that the embargo wasn’t timed to anything. “Didn't even know about the Clinton speech,” he said.The Ryan scoop led to an immediate spike in traffic for the Gazette, and Schwartz said they've been a ""little concerned"" after some visitors received error messages when trying to access the site. But as of Thursday afternoon, the site hadn't crashed.""We’re getting hit pretty hard,"" Schwartz said. ""So far, so good."""

Rad said the following at the conference: One challenge we face at Tinder is making sure our tens of millions of users around the world have the same user experience. No matter who you are, no matter what you’re looking for, you should get quality matches through the Tinder experience. There’s an important transgender (and gender nonconforming) community on Tinder who haven’t had that experience... yet. We haven’t delivered for them, so we’re working with LGBTQ advisors, including transgender activist Andrea James and GLAAD to help us address this important demographic. This is not only the right thing to do for our users, it’s the right thing to do, period.A representative from GLAAD confirmed with HuffPost that the organization will indeed be working with Tinder to make the app more inclusive, but could not provide further comment at this time. For Tinder -- a major online dating/hook-up app that boasts an estimated 50 million users -- to acknowledge it's need to accommodate all users regardless of gender identity, in the face of so much transphobia, is a huge win. Here's to other apps following suit. "
27,BUSINESS,The Obama Administration Cracks Down On Payday Lenders,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-agency-payday-lenders_us_57502482e4b0eb20fa0ccd7f,It will get harder to trap people in unaffordable debt.,2016-06-02,<br>The rule takes direct aim at the core business of payday lenders: giving people loans that they can’t afford to pay back without refinancing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the first time, there will soon be broad rules protecting U.S. borrowers from being stuck in a spiral of debt from loans that typically have rates of 390 percent and often higher. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) conceived, announced a proposed rule covering payday loans, as well as other high-interest lending products like auto and installment loans. Previously, these high-cost loans were mostly regulated at the state level.The rule takes direct aim at the core business of payday lenders: giving people loans that they can’t afford to pay back without refinancing. Turning a short-term lack of cash into a chain of unaffordable loans “is the core of the payday loan business model,” payday loan expert Nick Bourke at Pew Charitable Trusts told The Huffington Post in November. “To any objective, fair-minded reviewer, that’s not in question.” CFPB research has found that more than half of payday loans are made to people as part of a string of 10 or more loans.It's a bit ""like getting into a taxi just to ride across town and finding yourself stuck in a ruinously expensive cross-country journey,"" CFPB director Richard Cordray said in prepared remarks, to be delivered in Kansas City on Thursday.The CFPB’s proposal contains two key measures aimed at ensuring that borrowing once does not throw consumers into a spiral of unpayable debt. The first measure requires lenders to assess if the borrower has the income to fully repay the loan when it is due without reborrowing. This idea, known as “ability to repay,” targets at the cycle of debt that unaffordable payday loans can trap people in. The proposed rule also prohibits lenders from making more than two unsuccessful attempts to withdraw money from borrowers bank accounts. Repeated debit attempts cause consumers to be hit with overdraft fees from their banks. Such fees hit half of all online borrowers, costing an average of $185.In private, the payday lending industry admits unaffordable lending products that force borrowers to take out new loans to pay off old ones are core to the industry's profits. “In practice, consumers mostly either roll over or default; very few actually repay their loans in cash on the due date,” wrote Hilary Miller, a key figure in the industry’s fight against regulation, in an email obtained by open records requests in November.A 2009 Center for Responsible Lending study found that people taking out new loans to repay old ones make up 76 percent of the payday market. And studies from the Deloitte Financial Advisory Services and Charles River Associates estimated that the CFPB’s proposed rule could reduce the volume of industry loans made by 60 to 74 percent, an indication that the rule would cut significantly into this. However, Bourke said it doesn't go far enough and doesn't encourage banks to provide low cost loans to needy Americans. “The CFPB has an historic opportunity to encourage safe, affordable lending—and they’re missing it. Its proposal makes it too easy for payday lenders to complete additional paperwork and issue a $500 loan with $600 in fees, while making it difficult for a bank to offer the same loan for $80.”The National Consumer Law Center said that while the proposed rule is promising, it is concerning that “lenders could make up to three back-to-back payday loans and could start the sequence again after only 31 days.”The payday lending industry immediately attacked the rule. It ""presents a staggering blow to consumers as it will cut off access to credit for millions of Americans who use small-dollar loans to manage a budget shortfall or unexpected expense,"" chief executive of the Community Financial Services Association Dennis Shaul said in a statement.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton applauded the proposed rule and assailed presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump for wanting to repeal the entire bank regulation law that, among many other things, created the CFPB. ""Working families deserve a president who will look out for them -- not payday lenders and special interests on Wall Street,"" she said.The agency will accept comments on the proposed rule until Sept. 14, 2016. Those comments will then be examined and considered before the final rule is released."
