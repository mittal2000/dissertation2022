That question is, ""Did you see the dragon?"" The fire breathing dragon flew over the new Fantasyland and had both children and adults in awe. I felt like a child on Christmas morning standing there staring up at the sky screaming ""OMG OMG this is so awesome!"" He (or she) simply flies through the sky above the castles and spits fire balls. There are rumors on whether this was a one time event or the dragon will be used nightly in the future. If the answer is nightly, I recommend you start planning your trip to the Walt Disney World theme parks now because this moment alone will create the lasting memories we strive for as parents.I recommend Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We stayed in the Cars Family Suites, and I was surprised by the amount of detail they've put into the hotel. I'll be sure to fill you in on more about the resort in a later post but for now check out the review I did earlier in the year on the Walt Disney World Art of Animation Resort .Unfortunately neither my camera or phone would take a good picture of the dragon, but Gary Buchanan from DisneyParks.com took wonderful video and edited it to perfection. Now you can see the dragon from up close and from afar. I must admit it looks much more realistic from far away but I did want to see what it looked like close up and it's pretty impressive. Those Imagineers just knock it out of the park every time!"

2,MONEY,Inheritance Taxes Need to Be Raised Substantially,"Allan Brawley, Contributor

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c98d83c0000660009d294.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Forbes Magazine recently published its annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans and invited us to join it in celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of these supposedly self-made billionaires. But, even the most cursory examination of the list reveals that, while there are individuals who made their huge fortunes through their own entrepreneurship, inventiveness, or whatever it takes these days to accumulate great wealth, it is certainly not the case with all of them. A significant portion clearly got a huge leg up in the race to the top of the financial heap by being lucky enough to be born into an already fabulously rich family. Looking at the top ten alone, half -- David Koch and four of Sam Walton's children -- did nothing notable to earn their place, aside from inheriting their parents' money. Neither the Kochs nor the Waltons pulled themselves up by their bootstraps or created products or services that changed the lives of millions of people around the world. On the contrary, the Kochs have used their inherited wealth to corrupt the democratic process for their own financial and political gain while the Waltons have engaged in monopolistic practices that have impoverished workers on both the supply and retail sides of their enterprise, while systematically driving smaller competitors out of business. Perusing the rest of the list reveals a similar pattern. Perhaps as many as a third are people of middle class origin but most either built upon or simply chose to live well on their extremely generous inheritances.In just the past year, the average net worth of each of these individuals increased by $400 million to a record $4.2 billion. The collective wealth of the 400 has increased from $300 billion in 1992 to $1.7 trillion by the latest count, a more than fivefold increase. Meanwhile, the net worth of the middle class has been stagnant and poverty rates have soared. If this does not provide clear evidence that the economy and the tax laws are heavily rigged in favor of the have-mores and want-mores, I don't know what would. This situation is not only grossly unfair but insupportable in the long run. The extreme and unabated concentration of wealth in the hands of the few and the impoverishment of everyone else will bring about the inevitable collapse of the total economic system. So what should be done? At the very least, the inheritance tax rate should be raised on the billionaires and multimillionaires, as well as eliminating the countless devices they use to avoid whatever rates apply to them, through the creation of trusts, shadow companies, off-shore accounts, and the like. The tax rates on estates, as in the case of taxes on income, should be progressive, with the lowest rates -- the present 15 percent -- applied to inheritances over $10 million, and the highest -- maybe 70 percent -- imposed on multibillion-dollar estates. The actual rates and corresponding levels can vary -- and certainly would, as a result of any congressional action -- but the important point is to put this topic on the table so that it can be part of the national debate about balancing the budget. It is noteworthy that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are proposing increases in the estate tax. As always, the latter are putting forth their usual lame arguments for lowering or eliminating it. Most notable among these is the threat that inheritance taxes supposedly pose to the nation's family-owned farms when, in reality, the greatest destroyer of the family farm has been the huge agribusiness monopolies who have benefited enormously from Republican policies. If, by any chance, tax reform of the type I am proposing receives any consideration, there is a danger that much of the public will be hoodwinked into opposing it on the basis that their own resources -- no matter how modest -- will be affected. There will also be legions of commentators and others who will spout the anti-government mantra and argue that we must not overtax the billionaires because they are -- contrary to all evidence -- the creators of jobs. Another justification advanced for allowing members of the Forbes 400 and people like them to hang onto their billions is that they do good works with their money. That is certainly true for some of them who provide financial support to a variety of philanthropic causes and institutions. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are the most notable examples of those billionaires who seem to have a well-developed social conscience. The problem is that most of them donate a miniscule portion of their vast fortunes to philanthropy and only to causes and institutions of their own choosing. Their support often comes with the explicit requirement that the recipient -- a university, hospital, theatre, museum, or some such entity -- name a building, clinic, school or scholarship for them or one of their family members. What's wrong with this? Nothing much, if these donations were not tax-deductible and, therefore, diverting tax revenue from the Treasury to subsidize causes and institutions that are probably not a national priority. It makes no sense, especially in a time of fiscal crisis, to forego taxes that can be used for improved public education, renewed national infrastructure, and countless other pressing needs, in order to indulge the individual preferences and personal gratification of the wealthy.   It is essential to the health of the economy and the wellbeing of the country as a whole that this topic be put on the table and actively supported by those who want a more just tax system. There is reason to believe that, with sufficient public education and advocacy, the idea could gain political traction. Based on the results of the recent national campaign in which the president explicitly ran on a platform that promised to raise taxes on the wealthy and subsequent polls that indicate strong support for that plan, it might have more support than one might expect under other circumstances. While the president and the rest of the Democrats have been focusing on income taxes -- which, at least in theory, are earned -- what would make the case for raising inheritance taxes -- which are unearned -- any less compelling?"

The holiday season makes me acutely aware of just how many people are involved in making my life a life and how I often render them invisible. I do so not out of spite, but perhaps if you are like me, it simply feels as if every week starts off with the best intentions and a goal to take the time to smell the roses (as well as thank the people who keep them so nicely pruned), and by week's end I am all caught up it what feels like what matters. But does it?Take, for instance, the lovely lady who has delivered my mail for the past five years. Granted, I am not home a great deal, but in five years I have had opportunity to say more than ""hello."" I know nothing about her other than she does a remarkable job of always delivering my mail and doing it with a smile. As a result, I owe her far more than an obtuse wave and half smile, and for that I offer my apologies.To the man at the dry cleaners who calls me every 15 days when I have already wondered why my closet is empty and have restocked the essentials, believing I must have lost them during my last trip. You matter, and I appreciate your kindness.So many people who make a difference in my life -- like the check-out clerk at the supermarket who knows what I need far better than I and makes mention if one of my staples is missing or running low. Or the attendant at the gas station who reminds me to take my cell phone off the top of the car before I pull away, as is my habit. An army of perfect strangers who are still deeply involved in my life, and for reasons that remain a mystery deeply invested in me. Not the me that they hear about or see doing this, that and the other thing, but me: the guy who needs his mail, forgets his laundry, despises food shopping and leaves his phone just about everywhere.At a time when we hear so much about what people are not doing and what people need to do to act responsibly, I offer my simple truth. Uncomplicated gestures move mountains and deserve to be acknowledged. Kindness is not a birthright and as such should be acknowledged. I am not a bad person for having connected the dots a bit late in the game, but I do have some work to do and make up for lost time.I am officially ready to take on the challenge and let the army of people who make my life possible aware of the way in which they shape my days for the better.

The entire remodel process was filmed, and Hollyscoop even had photos of Lohan shopping with designer Kathryn Ireland for furniture which included Venetian table lamps and sofas. And according to TMZ, Lohan was completely onboard but then suddenly decided against taping the final shot. Bravo producers are supposedly trying to put the episode together without Lohan. But that’s just the start of all this trouble. TMZ is also reporting Lohan can’t even pay the $8,000 rent on said house and unsuccessfully has tried to break the lease. She will remain responsible for the home until February 2013 when the lease is up. According to the Daily Mail the home has four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a jacuzzi, white columns and a unusual curved pool. We knew Lohan was having money problems after the Internal Revenue Service recently froze her accounts due to $233,904 in unpaid taxes -- but to bite the hands that decorate your house?

JacobsCHARLESTON, S.C., Dec 9 (Reuters) - For 37 years straight, Joseph P. Riley Jr. has sat behind the mayor's desk here, shaping this city and its budget.On a recent afternoon, Riley, 69, reached for a draft copy of next year's spending plan and wondered aloud about what might get cut should politicians in Washington fail to find an agreement this month, unleashing $600 billion worth of spending reductions and tax hikes next year.Hiring new police officers for the city of 123,000 could be put on hold, Riley said. A new piece of equipment for the fire department would have to wait. Sanitation workers might be in trouble, too.""The thought that they would allow the economic harm that would ensue if we went over the fiscal cliff is mind-boggling,"" said Riley, a Democrat who was elected to his 10th term last year.Charleston, a beautiful city steeped in history and awash in tourist dollars, would seem at first glance a world apart from the harm that could be caused by the combination of spending cuts and higher taxes. Economists predict its arrival could send the United States hurtling back into a recession.At its edges, however, Charleston harbors the people who are most vulnerable to Washington's intransigence, making the city an emblem of a country's worry and of the powerlessness people feel in the face of Washington's indecision.The sting of automatic cuts would be felt acutely by those who work in the defense sector and the poor. They form two prominent groups in Charleston County who may share little but the knowledge that federal belt-tightening is less a nuisance than an existential threat.In South Carolina, defense spending accounts for $15.7 billion in annual economic activity - more than one in 10 dollars spent in the state - and nearly 140,000 jobs.The Charleston area alone, which includes a large Air Force base and a Navy facility, holds more than 66,000 defense jobs and nearly half of the state's military economic activity, according to a report released last month by the South Carolina Department of Commerce.While Charleston, like the rest of the state, has seen a boom in military spending over the last decade, the area has the state's second-highest concentration of people living in poverty, according to 2010 U.S. census data. More than one in four children live in poverty in the surrounding county.From the anticipated cuts to the military to the shrinking of the safety net, Charleston shows what's at stake should the United States fall off the fiscal cliff.'DEVASTATION'A fast-talking engineer originally from Detroit, Michigan, Rebecca Ufkes founded UEC Electronics with her husband in neighboring Hanahan 17 years ago. Walking past employees in blue lab coats assembling components for military vehicles and commercial products last week, Ufkes described the chilling effect the possibility of cuts have had on Charleston's defense industry.In September, Ufkes traveled to Washington as a part of a lobbying effort organized by the Aerospace Industry Association, hoping to impress politicians with the dangers facing her 200-person company and its competitors should the anticipated $500 billion in defense cuts, over 10 years, come to pass.She came away encouraged by her state's largely Republican representation in Washington but frustrated by other lawmakers.""South Carolina is a very pro-business state,"" she said. ""They are very keen on economics. It's just that we are only one of 50 states.""Ufkes, 48, said she worries not only about the uncertainty that has left defense contractors unsure where to invest but the impending tax increases, which she said will put her company, active in the commercial marketplace as well, at a disadvantage against foreign rivals.""Probably the solution is not going to be perfect for UEC,"" she said, ""but I don't want it to be devastating. Compromise and devastation are not the same thing.""With a mug declaring, ""Failure is not an option,"" sitting on her desk, Ufkes predicted that her company would make it, no matter how devastating the cuts are.""If we don't survive,"" she said. ""I don't know who will.""NO 'GIFTS'Five miles (eight km) from Ufkes' cutting-edge electronics manufacturer is the struggling North Charleston neighborhood of Chicora-Cherokee, where Bill Stanfield and his wife, Evelyn Oliveira, arrived fresh out of Princeton Theological Seminary 10 years ago.They founded Metanoia, a development organization focusing on bettering the community by securing housing loans, planting a garden, and running after-school and summer programs.Through government services like AmeriCorps, the national volunteer group, and funds from sources like the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Stanfield said his group received nearly a fifth of its funding from the federal government last year.With politicians facing immense pressure over limiting cuts to entitlements like the Medicare health insurance program for seniors and the Social Security retirement program, advocates for the poor say they expect painful reductions in spending on education and housing.""I don't know if our housing program would survive,"" Stanfield, 39, said.Cuts to education will hit South Carolina hard, where the schools have bled money over the last five years.According to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, South Carolina's cuts to education have been the fifth largest in the country, slicing 18 percent off of per-student spending during that period.The Obama administration, which Republicans consider a profligate spender, has felt like lean times in neighborhoods like Chicora-Cherokee, Stanfield said.""You know Mitt Romney said that people voted for Obama because of gifts?"" Stanfield said. ""There's this misconception that President Obama has been a gravy train of funding. There was more funding under President Bush of these organizations than under Obama.""'GAME OF CHICKEN'Last month, Riley, the Charleston mayor, went to Washington with a group of fellow city leaders, Democrats and Republicans, to lobby the White House and Congress to save cities from drastic cuts.Vice President Joseph Biden and Democratic leaders from the House of Representatives and Senate met with the mayors. House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders in Congress declined their invitation, Riley said.While Riley supports Obama's proposal to increase taxes on income earned over $250,000, a sticking point in the negotiations, he and other mayors cautioned that ending the tax-free status of municipal bonds would strangle cities' access to needed capital.Riley returned to Charleston feeling like a deal, which could prevent the harshest blows from hitting his city, its residents and jobs, was in the offing. Now, he said, he is not so sure.""It looks like it's a game of chicken,"" he said, ""and there are signals that they are going to go through with it."""

I ask this question in light of the news that Dallas Cowboys nose tackle Josh Brent has been arrested for intoxication manslaughter after allegedly causing the tragic death of his teammate and friend Jerry Brown. According to the police in Irving, Texas, where the crash occurred on Saturday morning, Brent, the driver, had been speeding before the vehicle hit a curb and flipped over. Brent was treated for minor injuries. Brown, the passenger, was killed.As the author of a book on the history of drunk driving in the United States, I must, unfortunately, answer ""no"" to this question, at least for now. Drunk driving is both one of the most deadly and one of the most preventable things that Americans do. Thanks to the work of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID) and other organizations, annual deaths due to drunk driving have dropped from 25,000 in 1980 to roughly 11,000 now. But we still tolerate this criminal act far too much.The successful fight against drunk driving has come from many factors, including tougher laws, quicker punishments and publicity campaigns such as ""Drink Responsibly"" and ""Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk."" We have also built on the experiences of countries such as Sweden and Australia and promoted the use of designated drivers.It is reasonable to speculate that these efforts have lowered the rates of drunk driving among NFL players and, for that matter, all professional athletes. But there is still a culture of drinking and driving among NFL players. As Dan Wetzel reported on Yahoo, drunk driving is the league's biggest legal issue. A study by the San Diego Union-Tribune found that 112 of the 385 NFL player arrests between 2000 and 2008 involved drunk driving. In 2009, Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donté Stallworth, who had been drinking at a hotel bar in Florida, struck and killed a pedestrian.  The problem is that there are limits to moral and legal deterrents. Brent himself should have known better than anyone. While in college in 2009, he pleaded guilty to DUI to DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000. But the sad fact is that trying to force people to behave in a certain way does not always work. In what may be the most ironic aspect of this whole tragedy, the national headquarters of MADD are located in Irving, Texas, where the crash occurred.There are things that the NFL could do. For example, the league could mandate that all of their players install ignition interlocks, essentially breathalyzers, in their cars. The driver must blow into these devices and be sober in order for the car to start. The NFL could mandate that players use taxis or other designated driving services when they go out at night or risk suspension and loss of their salaries. Or, more provocatively, the NFL could ban advertisements of beer and other alcohol products in stadiums.These ideas, however, are pie in the sky. It is highly unlikely that NFL owners want to act as policemen, monitoring the behaviors of their players. Indeed, America's strong libertarian traditions, less pronounced in other countries, have always hindered more aggressive prevention of drunk driving. And alcohol, especially beer, is intimately related to football. Not only do sales of these products and related advertising lead to considerable income for teams, but football fans love to drink, whether when tailgating or inside the stadium. Banning beer sales late in the game probably prevents some drunk driving, but not much.However, there is a new technology on the horizon that may help not only NFL players but all of us to not drive drunk. Within several years, it may be possible for automobile companies to install infrared technology in all cars that can sense blood alcohol when a driver puts his or her hands on the wheel. If you have been drinking, the car won't start. Libertarians will hate this, but I propose that saving thousands of lives annually should trump their arguments.For now, we can hope that the death of Jerry Brown, and the likely prison sentence for Jason Brent, serves as yet another wake-up call for other NFL players who believe that drunk driving crashes only happen to other people. They are wrong. Dead wrong."

(AP Photo/Dave Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6c5a5240000510056dc34.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Age considers, youth ventures.""For the first time in the 78 years of the Heisman Trophy, the voters have considered the candidates and honored a freshman. Johnny Manziel of Texas A&M, who has proven one of the most adventurous and effective forces in college football, racked up an astounding 43 total touchdowns and 4,600 total yards over 12 games this season. ""This is a moment that I've dreamed about since I've been a kid running around the backyard pretending I was Doug Flutie throwing Hail Mary's to my dad,"" Manziel said after being named the winner. ""Now I'm so blessed to be on the stage with such a group of great guys.""Manziel tallied 2,029 points and 474 first place votes to join the exclusive fraternity of players to hoist the stiff-arm trophy, per ESPN. Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o finished second with 1,706 points and 321 first place votes. Dual-threat quarterback Collin Klein of Kansas State placed third with 894 points and 60 first place votes. Marqise Lee of USC and Braxton Miller of Ohio State rounded out the top five. As dangerous with his arm as he was with his legs, the 20-year-old redshirt freshman out of Tivy High School in Texas, authored one of the most memorable moments of the campaign, leading the Aggies to an upset triumph over Alabama. Manziel emerged from Tuscaloosa as legitimate contender for the Heisman and with the Ballad of Johnny Football on the lips of college football fans across the nation. After the field of Heisman contenders was narrowed down to Manziel, Te'o and Klein, there was only one certainty: History would be made in New York. Manziel arrived in hopes of becoming the first freshman to win the award. Te'o stopped off in the Big Apple before the BCS Championship Game with designs on becoming the first purely defensive player to win the honor while Klein aspired to be the first player to bring the Heisman back to the Little Apple in Kansas. ""Hopefully, they don't rob him like they did me,"" Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson said to The Associated Press regarding doubts that voters would bestow the honor upon a freshman. Peterson placed second as a freshman in 2004 but lost by 328 votes to junior Matt Leinart. ""I hope he wins.""He did. Youth ventured (and scrambled and then fumbled but recovered to throw a touchdown). Age considered. And Johnny Football is the 78th winner of the Heisman Trophy."
