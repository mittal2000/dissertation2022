0,POLITICS,Larry Lessig Believes Democracy Is Screwed. So He's Running For President To Save It.,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/larry-lessig-2016_us_55c93a18e4b0f1cbf1e61b66,The Harvard legal scholar promised to quit if he passes his reform agenda.,2015-08-11,"<p>Though Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) warns regularly about the influence of money in politics, Lessig believes he must prioritize it more. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Larry Lessig, a well-known legal theorist and political activist, is taking the plunge into electoral politics, announcing on Tuesday that he will formally explore a run for the presidency in 2016 as a Democrat.Lessig, a Harvard law professor, will be a distinctly unconventional White House aspirant. In an interview, he said he will run on a singular platform: the Citizen Equality Act, which includes campaign finance reform, an end to partisan gerrymandering, and a vast expansion of voting access that would make Election Day a national holiday. Should he win and lead the passage of that agenda, Lessig said he'll promptly quit, handing the office to his vice president, whoever that may be.“This is not a 'Rent Is Too Damn High' campaign,” Lessig said, referencing the infamous 2010 gubernatorial run of Jimmy McMillan in New York. “This is a campaign about how we need to intervene to make democracy possible again. Raising the salience of that issue is enormously important. I think there is more of a chance that we do more than just raise the salience. ... It is a shot worth taking regardless of the criticism that will come.”Individuals have run for the White House before with the aim of spotlighting an issue more than occupying an office. Lessig is of that vein, having warned about the pernicious influence of money in politics for years now. It's almost fantastical to imagine the swift series of successes that would result in him challenging William Henry Harrison, who died after 32 days in office, for the shortest presidency.Lessig said his goals, for now, are more pragmatic. Assuming none of the other current candidates adopt his platform, he wants to raise $1 million by Labor Day (via small donations, naturally), after which he will officially declare his ""referendum campaign,"" build a campaign infrastructure and find his way to the debate stage (the likely reason why he’s running under a party banner).After that, however, Lessig's plan grows more aspirational. He said, for example, that the reason his agenda would pass Congress after he's elected -- as opposed to now, when lawmakers aren't exactly burning midnight oil to debate the Citizen Equality Act's provisions -- is because an election solely on those issues will bring an indisputable mandate for action. People will realize, ""as Elizabeth Warren puts it, that we have to unrig the system,” he said.Lessig tried to produce this cascading effect before, and it didn’t end particularly well. In 2014, he started a super PAC devoted to helping finance candidates who promoted campaign finance reform. His Mayday PAC lost nearly every race it played in.From those defeats, Lessig said he drew two lessons. The first is that it's easier to get traction on an issue in a primary election. The second is that it is people will rally around a cause they think has a chance of passage. ""What you’ve got to do is intervene in a way that gets them away from the resignation that nothing is possible,” he said.Launching a long shot presidential bid might not be the most obvious method of ginning up that hope in the possible. But it will give Lessig a larger audience than he had in 2014. And it should, at a minimum, press other 2016 candidates to more aggressively address the issue of money in politics.Of those candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) seems to actually be running the very campaign that Lessig wants for himself. With his precision Brooklyn accent, Sanders warns about the United States turning into an “oligarchy” at almost every campaign stop.It's not that Sanders doesn't recognize the problem, Lessig explained. It's that he doesn't prioritize it. (On Sanders' campaign website, Lessig noted, “Getting Big Money Out Of Politics” is at the bottom of the issues page.) And unless he makes money a top priority, the rest of the agenda is as good as doomed, Lessig said.“We have to do this first and then we can do a lot of other things,” Lessig said. “The question is not if he checked the right policy boxes. It is does he have a way to get those policies passed?”"

The gunfire prompted dozens of police cars to converge on the area. A police helicopter also shined a spotlight onto the street to help illuminate the scene.Protesters and members of the media who had gathered in the street took cover or fled when the firing started, The Associated Press reported. Authorities told KTVI, the local Fox affiliate, that one man was shot by police and taken to an area hospital. During an overnight news conference, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said plainclothes officers had been tracking the suspect, who they believed was armed. The man then approached the officers, who were in an unmarked police car, and opened fire.The officers returned fire from inside the vehicle, Belmar said, and pursued the suspect on foot. More gunshots rang out between the man and the officers, and the suspect was hit.The suspect's identity has not been released, but he was listed in ""critical, unstable"" condition, Belmar said. The four officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave.Protesters were blocking traffic and confronting police just before the shooting, AP reported. One person even threw a glass bottle at officers but missed.Tony Rice, a protester who was arrested for not leaving the scene, recorded the incident. St. Louis County Police Lt. Jerry Lohr ordered that Rice be released after interviewing him. Rice told The Huffington Post that he doesn't think the young man was firing at police officers. Ruptly TV released a video of what appears to be at least one civilian firing shots at the demonstration. Rice said this incident took place across the street from where the man was found. Earlier in the day, hundreds of people gathered in the middle of the street to pay respect to Brown, the 18-year-old whose shooting death sparked what some consider a new civil rights movement.Last August, Brown got into an altercation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after he allegedly stole a pack of cigarillos from a nearby convenience store. Wilson then shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed.A grand jury in St. Louis County decided not to indict Wilson, and a federal investigation into the shooting found no viable civil rights charges against the white officer. However, soon after the shooting, protests erupted in the St. Louis suburb and elsewhere, some of which turned violent. In a separate report, the Justice Department cited racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and in the municipal court system. Ferguson's city manager, police chief and municipal judge resigned within days of that report. Also on HuffPost:"
2,POLITICS,Lawyer For Cop Who Killed Zachary Hammond Tries To Change The Story,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zachary-hammond-mike-tiller_us_55c8b940e4b0f73b20b9e8b6,But new details still don't explain why the officer chose to shoot.,2015-08-10,"<p>Zachary Hammond, 19, was fatally shot by a police officer during a minor drug bust last month.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c8f681170000b70056716d.jpeg?ops=crop_18_99_410_263%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Police in Seneca, South Carolina, last Friday released the name of the officer who fatally shot 19-year-old Zachary Hammond in a minor marijuana sting in July, following nearly two weeks of resistance from Seneca Police Chief John Covington. Shortly afterward, a lawyer representing the officer sought to shift the scrutiny off his newly identified client and back onto Hammond's actions.In a statement Friday, attorney John Mussetto defended 32-year-old Lt. Mike Tiller, a 10-year veteran of law enforcement. Both Tiller and Hammond are white.The lawyer said Tiller pulled into a Hardee's parking lot on July 26 to back up an undercover officer making a drug deal with a passenger in Hammond's vehicle. Tiller parked his patrol car in a position to box in Hammond's Honda Civic, before approaching the vehicle and ordering Hammond to show his hands.""Rather than abide by this order, Mr. Hammond rapidly reversed his vehicle towards Lt. Tiller's patrol vehicle,"" Mussetto said. ""Mr. Hammond then rapidly accelerated in the direction of Lt. Tiller, forcing the lieutenant to push off of Mr. Hammond's car to keep from being struck and run over.""Tiller fired two shots into Hammond's vehicle ""in order to stop the continuing threat to himself and the general public,"" Mussetto said. ""If not for Lieutenant Tiller's quick reflexes and his ability to push off of the car, Lieutenant Tiller would have easily been run over by Mr. Hammond.""Instead, Tiller killed Hammond with the two gunshots, one to the back of his left shoulder and a fatal shot to his left side. Autopsies have shown that the officer began shooting at near point-blank range through the open driver's side window.While the allegation that Hammond put his car in reverse before driving it at Tiller appears to be new, it did nothing to assuage the concerns of the young man's family.Eric Bland, an attorney for Hammond's family, said, ""[T]he entry wounds of the two bullet holes are the best and most accurate piece of evidence of the location of Lt. Tiller when he discharged his weapon and whether he or anyone else was under threat for his physical safety at the time he discharged his bullets."" The lawyer suggested that it would have been very difficult for any officer to ""push off"" an accelerating vehicle, re-establish his balance and then fire two shots through that moving vehicle's open window, which both hit their target.Bland has previously said that the direction of the bullets proves that police haven't been telling the truth about the incident.In a statement Sunday, he also took issue with Mussetto's claim that Hammond was truly a threat at the time of the shooting.""There was no warrant for his arrest,"" Bland said. ""There was no APB for him or his car. There was no murder or [life] that was in danger if shots were not fired and the automobile continued on to leave Hardees. There was no AMBER alert. There was no ticking bomb situation. This is clearly made up. It is ridiculous.""In his statement last week, Mussetto said that ""a white powdery substance consistent with powder cocaine was found by the coroner on Mr. Hammond's person and was taken as evidence by [the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division],"" which is now investigating Hammond's case.An incident report filed by another officer at the scene makes no mention of cocaine being found on Hammond’s body. In any case, this detail is irrelevant to the questions currently being asked of police in Seneca. Possible cocaine possession does nothing to explain why an officer used lethal -- and the family argues excessive -- force on Hammond.Hammond's parents, along with Bland, have also expressed concern that the circumstances of their son's death aren't being questioned loudly enough by the community. Around 50 people attended a candlelight vigil for Zachary on Friday night, but the Hammonds told the Charleston-based Post and Courier that they've heard nothing from city leaders or other elected officials. Bland has suggested that race initially played a factor in the lack of coverage -- though outlets including The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post picked up the story last week following substantial outrage on Twitter, largely from supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement.Black non-violence activist Jack Logan, of Greenville, South Carolina, has also scheduled a ""rally for justice"" for Hammond, set to be held on Aug. 15 in downtown Seneca."
3,POLITICS,Push To Permit Pot In Denver Bars Gains Momentum,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-denver-bars_us_55c8e8eae4b0f1cbf1e5c4b6,"""It's ludicrous that we can't have something similar to the bars, restaurants and private clubs we have for alcohol.""",2015-08-10,Because Most Americans Are Unenthusiastic About It,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559de2b71700002600325e03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Backers of a Denver ballot initiative that would allow adults to consume marijuana in some bars and other venues say they have collected more than 10,000 signatures in support of the measure -- many more than needed -- and they submitted the petition to the city clerk on Monday.The city clerk now has 25 days to certify it. If the clerk finds 4,726 valid signatures, the measure will appear on the ballot this November. The proposal would permit the smoking and vaporizing of marijuana in non-residential spaces that can't be publicly viewed. (Currently, recreational cannabis consumption is restricted to private homes and some hotels that allow it.) Smoking pot would likely be confined to enclosed outdoor areas, since Colorado state law limits indoor smoking.""While petitioning, we found that most voters agree adults should be able to consume marijuana socially in establishments that choose to allow it,"" Mason Tvert, proponent of the measure and communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. ""By allowing adults to consume marijuana in private businesses, we can reduce the likelihood that they'll consume it publicly in parks or on the street.""A survey conducted by Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling in July supports Tvert's observation. PPP found that 56 percent of likely 2015 Denver voters would favor allowing businesses to permit cannabis consumption on the premises. Only 40 percent said they were opposed. Colorado became the first state -- and the first government in the world -- to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana for adults in 2012, with the first retail shops opening in 2014. State law continues to ban recreational marijuana consumption ""openly and publicly,"" but the law doesn't specifically block pot use in private clubs for those 21 and older. The proposed ballot initiative would help to define private clubs in Denver.If voters approved the measure, Denver would become the first U.S. city to allow public marijuana use.Since Colorado's recreational marijuana law passed, a number of underground, fee-based, bring-your-own-pot clubs have sprung up in and around the city. Law enforcement has at times cracked down on those gatherings. A handful of recreational marijuana clubs exist outside the Denver area.Some Colorado lawmakers questioned whether the ballot measure would be lawful under current state statutes. ""What the proponents of this initiative are trying to do may be pre-empted in a large way by state law,"" Democratic state Rep. Dan Pabon, who represents Denver, told HuffPost. ""It may just be a token statement of allowing use in this manner, rather than actually having a binding effect on how we generally look at this use policy.""But he added, ""It invites a much-needed conversation about this issue.""The city government of Denver has not taken a position on the measure. A memo analyzing the proposal and its relationship to existing state law -- prepared by Denver's assistant city attorney, David W. Broadwell, for the city council -- says that the ordinance ""will create a serious conflict with state law,"" which may force the Colorado legislature to address the issue on a statewide basis in its 2016 session.The city attorney's office still fully expects the measure to find its way onto the ballot. ""Based upon the number of signatures reported to be on the petitions, we can anticipate that the Clerk's office will likely determine the petitions to be sufficient, resulting in the measure appearing on the November ballot,"" the memo begins.The memo was distributed to the city council on Monday and was provided to HuffPost by the Office of Marijuana Policy.State Rep. Jonathan Singer (D), a vocal supporter of marijuana policy reform in the state, told HuffPost that people should be able to consume cannabis legally and safely in public venues.""It's ludicrous that we can't have something similar to the bars, restaurants and private clubs we have for alcohol,"" Singer said. He told HuffPost that he plans to introduce a bill in the upcoming legislative session to address this exact issue at the state level.Tvert and Brian Vicente, one of the authors of Amendment 64, which legalized recreational marijuana in the state, gave a press conference in front of the Denver City-County Building on Monday afternoon to announce the collection of the signatures and submission of the petition.Here's how the proposed ballot question would read, if it makes it onto the November ballot:Shall the voters of the City and County of Denver adopt a measure permitting the consumption of marijuana by individuals twenty-one years of age or older at certain premises that are not private residential property, provided that individuals under the age of twenty-one are prohibited from entering any space where the consumption of marijuana is allowed, the owner, operator, or individual in control of the premises has authorized the consumption of marijuana, and the individual consuming marijuana neither smokes marijuana indoors in violation of Colorado’s Clean Indoor Air Act nor consumes marijuana in a location where the consumption of marijuana is visible from a nearby public place; permitting the operation of business and commerce involving the consumption of marijuana; permitting the Denver City Council to adopt ordinances that regulate signage, marketing, and advertising for any business that permits the consumption of marijuana; permitting the Denver City Council to regulate the hours of operation and create distance restrictions for any business that permits the consumption of marijuana that does not also hold a license to sell alcohol for onsite consumption; declaring it unlawful to permit marijuana consumption at a premises that is not private residential property unless certain conditions are met; immunizing businesses and property owners from certain licensing sanctions and public nuisance enforcement actions related to the consumption of marijuana, provided the consumption is in accordance with applicable ordinances; and clarifying that owners and residents of adjacent properties may bring private nuisance actions against any business that permits marijuana consumption and that the City of Denver may enforce air quality standards against these businesses?Also on HuffPost:"
4,POLITICS,Carly Fiorina Backs Maternity Leave Policy Worse Than Afghanistan's,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carly-fiorina-maternity-leave_us_55c91538e4b0923c12bde846,So do most Republican lawmakers.,2015-08-10,<p>Carly Fiorina doesn't want to force businesses to provide paid parental leave.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c9165b1700006e005671e1.jpeg?ops=crop_0_38_4000_2248%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- GOP presidential contender Carly Fiorina said on Sunday that she opposes changing federal law to require companies to provide paid maternity leave. Her position is at odds with the policies of virtually every developed country on Earth and considerably worse than the maternity leave policy in war-torn Afghanistan.The Huffington Post reached out to other Republican presidential contenders to see where they stand on mandatory paid maternity leave. None of them, including Fiorina, responded with comment by deadline. Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have, more broadly, backed guaranteed paid family leave.The federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 provides 12 weeks of leave for the birth of a child and other needs, but it does not require wage compensation. In addition, employees who have worked at a company for less than a year are not covered. Employers are left with a lot of leeway in how much they choose to accommodate mothers recovering from labor and parents with a newborn child. The result, as Rebecca Traister wrote in The New Republic, is that parenting has become ""a privileged pursuit"" that ""ultimately affirms public and professional life as being built for men.""To put Fiorina's position in perspective, Afghanistan requires 13 weeks of maternity leave during which 100 percent of a woman's earnings are covered, according to a report published last year by the International Labour Organization. Individual companies are held liable for the costs. According to the ILO report, out of 185 countries and territories for which information was available, the only nation besides the United States that does not require some cash benefits for women during maternity leave is Papua New Guinea, which is reportedly on the brink of a Greek-style economic meltdown. Papua New Guinea is also reportedly home to severe police abuse of detainees, violence against women, and vigilante killings, the U.S. State Department said last year. Policies like the one in Afghanistan, while stronger than that in the U.S., still leave mothers vulnerable to job discrimination, because employers may be reluctant to hire or promote pregnant workers to avoid paying the direct and indirect costs linked to their leave, the ILO pointed out. The ILO report also did not indicate to what extent Afghanistan's policy is actually enforced.Most developed countries, particularly in Europe, offer paid parental leave that is financed out of social insurance. But GOP support for that kind of financing also seems unlikely. Democrats introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act again this year, which would guarantee new parents and caretakers a portion of their income while on leave. It would be paid for by employee and employer contributions. But there are no Republican cosponsors.In the U.S., the glorification of individualism during the Reagan years turned some Americans away from the idea of guaranteed paid leave, tainting it as another tax expansion. As it stands, high-end companies like Netflix, whose policy Fiorina praised, offer generous paid parental leave policies. But companies that employ lots of minimum-wage workers don't. Even at Netflix, the new parental leave policy does not extend to workers in its DVD division.According to a study published by the Families and Work Institute, only 9 percent of companies in the U.S. offered fully paid maternity leave benefits in 2014, down from 16 percent six years earlier.""I don't think we can afford to wait for corporations, out of the goodness of their hearts, to come up with a policy,"" said Steven Wisensale, a professor at the University of Connecticut who has written on family leave policy.Parental leave experts said the current U.S. policy exacerbates the economic gap between women who work for companies that offer job protection and paid maternity leave, and women who do not. ""We want everybody to have a fair shake, and one way to do that is to have mandated leave by the government,"" Wisensale added.""At the national level, it is dead obvious why this should be funded -- you're talking about raising the next generation of citizens and that's why most countries fund it,"" said Joan Williams, a professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, who noted that she did not actually expect any change on the national level. She added, ""Not having mandated leave for employers is a recipe for pushing women out of the workplace."" "
5,COLLEGE,These Groups Are Hoping To Help First-Generation College Students Make It To Graduation,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/first-generation-college-students-problems-dont-end-when-they-enroll-heres-what-can-be-done_us_55c3d75ce4b0d9b743db9913,Two unique programs aimed at helping students make it through school are having a big impact.,2015-08-10,<p>Candidates for America Needs You's fellow program in Illinois take part in a group activity.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c4f46b14000077002e253f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For students aiming to be the first in their families to earn a college degree, there are many obstacles to getting into school -- but the challenges don’t end when they arrive on campus. However, several groups are seeking to change that with mentoring and career development programs that specifically aim to help these students finish school.Only 11 percent of first-generation, low-income college students graduate with a four-year degree, according to research from the Pell Institute, and first-generation students are twice as likely as those with parents who graduated from college to drop out of school. There are racial disparities to consider too, since Latinos represent the highest proportion of first-generation college students. African-American students are also overrepresented among the first-generation student population. One group working to address this graduation gap is America Needs You, a New York-based nonprofit that provides mentoring and career development training for low-income first-generation college students.Initially called New York Needs You, the group was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur and philanthropist Robert Reffkin, and launched the following year with an inaugural group of 50 college students. The students took part in the group's two-year “fellows” program, which consists of intensive career development and leadership training workshops, access to high-profile summer internships and one-on-one work with a volunteer young professional “mentor coach.""The organization changed its name to America Needs You when it expanded to New Jersey in 2012, and it also launched a program in Chicago earlier this year. CEO Kimberly Harris said ANY aims to celebrate the tenacity and resilience of first-generation students, while giving them the tools they need to succeed in school and beyond.“I’m betting on our students,” Harris told The Huffington Post. “If they can navigate issues like homelessness and abuse and extreme poverty, they can handle any issue in the boardroom when they get the opportunity.”To qualify for the fellowship program, applicants must show that neither of their parents or guardians have a bachelor’s degree and qualify as low-income by the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s standards. Prospective participants apply during their freshman year and start the program during the summer before sophomore year. The program is funded by foundations, corporate partners and fundraising events.First-generation college students drop out for a variety of reasons, including financial or academic factors. Harris also argues that many students lack an understanding of what a college degree will help them achieve, which is why she says ANY works to make secondary education feel “as relevant as possible, as early as possible.”The lessons students learn in the workshops are geared toward creating a road map of where they want to be in a decade -- and then working backward to determine what they should be doing now to meet their long-term goals. Along the way, participants learn to craft resumes and cover letters, speak in public and manage relationships.The program has had impressive results. ANY says 96 percent of current participants have graduated or are on track to graduate from college, while 90 percent of program alumni were either employed or continuing their education as graduate students within six months of graduating from college. In addition, 100 percent of participants who attended community colleges successfully transferred to four-year schools.Harris says the key to that success is the participants’ relationship with their mentor coaches.“Imagine going back to your college years and having one person dedicated to your success,” Harris said. “Even with the curriculum and workshops and hours of time learning substantive skills, what’s most important to this is building that trust with a young professional to help push the student along the way and keep them on track.”Though ANY plans to be operating in five states by 2020, the group is certainly limited by challenges of scalability, particularly since the national population of first-generation college students numbers in the millions.Chelsea Jones, associate director of student programs at the Center for Student Opportunity, a nonprofit based in Bethesda, Maryland, agreed that the sort of mentoring offered by ANY can go a long way toward helping a first-generation student feel better prepared for school and life after it.That's why her organization has created its own initiative, called I’m First, that offers something akin to virtual mentoring for students who hope to be the first in their families to finish college.CSO partners with 185 colleges and universities around the country that offer resources specifically aimed at first-generation students. Using these resources, the group hosts an online database that allows aspiring college students to determine which of those partner schools might be the best match for them.In addition, the I'm First website also publishes articles tailored to particular subsets of first-generation students, such as those who are undocumented or in foster care, as well as blog posts written by the eight to 10 first-generation students who have received scholarships from CSO.Jones, who herself attended Howard University as a first-generation college student, told HuffPost that the blog posts from peers, which often discuss challenges as well as successes, are helpful to aspiring college students. “This isn’t support you can get from home,” Jones said. “It’s not that they don’t support you, but they haven’t been there and don’t have the know-how to tell you what you should do or shouldn’t do. This [platform] lets them know they can do this, that it will be a little bit hard, but I’ve got this mentor or these bloggers who have gone through everything I’m going through now, so I’ve got this.”Beyond the support offered by groups like CSO and ANY, Jones said she believes more and more campuses are becoming aware of how they can help first-generation students toward graduation.“I think, little by little, schools are seeing that they are an asset to the campus and that they need them there and that they can’t just have them on campus and assume they’ll know what to do,"" she said."

The suit claims that Turner was wrongly arrested, that officers used excessive force that lead to her miscarriage and that the city routinely engages in the “concealment and suppression of the existence of police officer misconduct.”  Turner and Green's allegations echo broader complaints about systemic problems in Chicago's police department. The couple and their attorney, Jeffrey Granich, are challenging the continued employment of an officer with a questionable track record, as well as what they see as a “code of silence” that prevents the city from handling officer wrongdoing appropriately.The lawsuit says that a number of officers came to Turner and Green's home on the afternoon of Aug. 2, 2013, to tow Green's van. The couple maintains there was no legitimate reason for the tow, and they began arguing with the officers about why the car was being taken. Turner, who was several weeks pregnant at the time, started filming the interaction on her phone. She asked to retrieve three of her children's car seats and Green’s work boots and badge from the vehicle before they towed it, and was told she could not. Nonetheless, she approached the car, she says, and one of the officers slapped the phone out of her hands. When she bent down to pick it up, he grabbed her wrist.“I pulled my hands back with my hands facing him, both of my hands to him, like, ‘Officer, please don’t touch me, I’m not touching you, and I’m not doing anything, and I’m not going to approach the vehicle,’” Turner said. “And then I hear him say, ‘tase her.’”Turner said Kelly used his stun gun on her three times, hitting her stomach, leg and arm. She claims the officer used the weapon while she was standing and again after she was on the ground.“I’m screaming in excruciating pain, and I’m screaming, like, you know, what is going on? Like what am I being tased for, and I’m not even doing anything,” Turner continued. “My kids on the porch, they’re screaming, everybody outside, they’re looking like, what are you tasing her for, like, that’s a pregnant lady.’” Turner was arrested for resisting or obstructing, according to the lawsuit. She was taken to a hospital and spent the night in jail. Less than a week later, she says, she went to the hospital for heavy bleeding and was told she had miscarried. The lawsuit also notes that Green was charged twelve days later with aggravated assault on an officer.A police department spokeswoman declined to comment on the suit. John Holden, director of public affairs for Chicago’s law department, said the city had not been served with Turner and Green’s lawsuit and could not comment.Turner says she no longer has the video she shot before her arrest. Her criminal case is still pending. While fighting Turner's criminal charges, Granich became aware of past claims of misconduct against Kelly. In 2010, the officer was reportedly arrested for assault of a police sergeant, according to an unrelated lawsuit filed by the family of Kelly's friend, Michael LaPorta. The family claims Kelly's service weapon discharged and struck LaPorta in the back of the head while the two men were at Kelly's house after a night of drinking. Kelly claimed LaPorta, who is now permanently injured, shot himself. When a sergeant responded to the shooting, Kelly reportedly swung his arms at her, leading to his arrest.Those charges were dismissed, according to the LaPorta family's suit, which is ongoing. Turner's suit indicates that Kelly later received a 60-day suspension, though that detail is not confirmed in the LaPorta suit.Kelly is also one of several officers accused of use of force and false arrest in an open federal lawsuit, and was accused of false arrest in another lawsuit that was settled in 2009. Turner said it was ""chilling"" to learn of the numerous allegations against an officer who patrols her neighborhood.“You’re a police officer [meant] to protect and serve people; you have a record longer than the people you are arresting,” Turner said. “I’m scared for my life because I feel like you can do anything to me and they’re going to believe you over me.”The police department declined to comment on Kelly's record.The suit accuses the city of Chicago of “failing to adequately punish, discipline, investigate, or hold accountable prior instances [of] misconduct … thereby leading Chicago Police Officers (like Kelly and Weber) to believe their actions will never be scrutinized; and thereby directly encouraging future abuses such as those suffered by the Plaintiffs.” In addition, the lawsuit finds fault with the Independent Police Review Authority, which is tasked with looking into misconduct complaints. The IPRA took on-camera statements from Turner and Green two days after Turner’s arrest. The lawsuit claims that as of April, IPRA had not attempted to contact the involved officers.IPRA spokesman Larry Merritt declined to comment on the lawsuit or on the pending investigation.He noted, however, that each case is different and that there are no specific standards for the length of investigations or for when accused officers are contacted.“Our main focus is to reach the proper conclusion and the proper findings, so it’s [about doing] it in a fair, thorough manner. It’s not about time,” Merritt said. IPRA was formed in 2007 amid backlash to poor handling of misconduct complaints. In the years since, the agency has been accused of long delays, failing to complete investigations and sustaining few complaints. For Turner, a mother of nine, the most difficult thing about her arrest has been its effect on her kids, who she says watched her get “tased in the street like [she’s] an animal.”“When they see officers, police cars, they automatically think they’re coming to get me,” Turner said. “I don’t want that to affect them and always be scared or always feel negative about police when they see them, because not everybody is like that.”Also on HuffPost:"

Many vets have to submit a means test to be enrolled, but it's not required for combat vets, who are automatically eligible for five years of free care. The policy is spelled out on the VA's website.The document shows that 35,093 combat vets who applied for health care aren't getting it because the VA system has erroneously flagged them as needing to submit a means test. ""The VA has created an illegal, artificial barrier for people to access care,"" Davis said. ""We're not talking about people who didn't get care because they didn't want it. We're talking about people who turned in applications and VA said, 'No, go into a backlog because you didn't give us financial information.'""VA spokeswoman Walinda West confirmed that combat vets aren't required to provide financial information to be enrolled in health care.""VA is actively taking action to enroll and further reach out to these Veterans (by telephone and letters) due to the length of time some of these applications have been pending,"" West said.The vast majority of these combat vets served in Iraq or Afghanistan. About 16,000 of them have been pending for more than five years, while about 19,000 have been pending from between one month and five years. Combat vets lose their eligibility for free health care after five years.The document comes on the heels of another leaked VA document from April showing that nearly one-third of 847,000 vets with pending applications for health care had already died.Davis contacted the House and Senate veterans affairs committees about the glitch. The House committee reached out to VA officials on Aug. 3 asking for details, but hasn't heard back yet. A spokeswoman for the Senate committee said committee staff are scheduled to meet with VA officials at the Health Eligibility Center this week and plan to press for information on this issue.VA management has known about the problem since at least April. Last month, they issued a ""change request"" directing their systems management staff to create a computer script to ""automatically complete a means test"" for all pending combat vets.VA staffers also started working overtime last month to call all 35,000 combat vets to let them know of their pending health care status.The problem, though, is that nothing has happened since the change request was issued. On top of that, VA staffers are telling combat vets they have to fill out another form agreeing to co-pays before they can be enrolled -- even though they already agreed to co-pays in their original application. That's creating another barrier to enrollment for a group of vets who should never have been listed as pending in the first place.Here's the phone script staffers have been using at the Health Eligibility Center:Davis said there's a simple solution: go into the computer system, gather the Social Security numbers of combat vets listed as pending, and tell the system they are enrolled immediately. He said VA Secretary Bob McDonald has the authority to direct that change, and arguably a duty to do so since combat vets have been legally entitled to special health care eligibility status since January 2008.Asked why McDonald hasn't taken this action, West said the secretary ""does not have the legal authority"" to automatically enroll vets in health care. But she didn't clarify whether, specifically, he has the authority to override the VA computer system error that says combat vets need to fill out a means test, which is keeping them from being enrolled.""We are taking steps to contact and/or enroll these applicants as quickly as possible to ensure all appropriate action is taken and resolved to the satisfaction of those Veterans for whom we are honored to serve,"" West said. ""We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that this issue may have caused our Veterans. We are working to get this right.""HuffPost asked McDonald himself about the problem on Thursday, via a tweet read aloud at a Politico event, but he didn't address it. Instead, he announced his phone number and said to call him directly.""I'd be happy to check out their particular instance,"" McDonald said to Politico's Mike Allen, in response to the tweet. ""I like to deal with specifics and not generalities. Customer service is about one-on-one care. ... You have my phone number.""HuffPost called and left a message. He didn't return the call.This story has been updated with comments from a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee spokeswoman."

And Robert Reich is helping them explain why.,2015-08-10,"<p>Fed Chair Janet Yellen looks on at a Fed Up activist drawing attention to workers at the Kansas City Fed's 2014 symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c91eb71d00006e0014468b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Progressive groups are launching a national campaign this week to pressure the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates until wages begin growing more significantly. And they are getting some help from popular liberal economist Robert Reich.The groups, led by the Center for Popular Democracy’s Fed Up campaign -- a foundation-funded nonprofit committed to a more ""pro-worker"" Federal Reserve -- inaugurated the effort in earnest over the weekend with mass email blasts and solicitation on other digital platforms of a petition, “Tell the Fed: Don’t Raise Interest Rates!” Participating organizations, which include online progressive heavyweights CREDO Action, Daily Kos and the Working Families Party, will send the petition to an increasing number of activists over the course of the week. The groups, a complete list of which you can find in the petition, have a combined email list and website visitor reach in the millions.Activists will deliver the petition signatures they amass in the coming weeks to Fed officials at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 27-29. Fed Up is sending a delegation of low-income workers and representatives from communities of color to the symposium with the goal of raising awareness of working families’ concerns about Fed monetary policy. The Fed Up campaign formally began with a similar visit to Jackson Hole last year.Some of the emails to activists will include a video from Robert Reich, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley and former secretary of labor, that is likely to give the effort a high-profile boost. Reich posted the video, along with a link to the petition, on his Facebook page on Friday. As of Monday afternoon it already had been viewed over 142,000 times -- and shared by more than 3,600 people. Reich relies on a production team to make his videos, but does the illustrations featured in them himself.The new online campaign aims to influence the Fed at a pivotal moment: The central bank is indicating that it will raise interest rates as soon as September. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, who sits on the FOMC, confirmed on Monday that the Fed would soon raise rates, saying the ""the point of 'liftoff' is close."" Lockhart's remarks come after July jobs numbers Friday showed relatively steady job gains.Robert Reich’s Federal Reserve 101The progressive groups pushing back against a rate hike are betting that if the public knew how much they stood to lose if rates go up, they would be willing to speak out against a hike. They could then generate pressure to change the Fed’s calculus.For that to happen, though, people need to understand what the Federal Reserve is -- which activists acknowledge is rare. So Reich’s five-minute video starts at square one, explaining how the Federal Reserve works and why it affects Americans’ lives -- before articulating the case against a rate hike. The Fed cuts interest rates, or keeps them low, he explains, in order to stimulate the economy. “The lower the [Fed’s] rates, the easier it is to borrow,” Reich says in the video. “The easier it is to borrow, the more active the economy becomes.”Reich then elaborates on the virtuous cycle that takes hold when low rates leave people with more disposable income, as graphics illustrating his points whiz by onscreen. Consumers spend more, Reich explains, growing businesses and increasing demand for labor. And if there is enough demand for workers, he continues, employers raise wages to compete for those workers.Why Do Progressives Think A September Rate Hike Is Premature? Reich, like the campaign he is backing, makes the case that the Fed should wait until demand for workers is high enough to increase wages substantially before raising interest rates. Although the official unemployment rate of 5.3 percent is low by historical standards, it has yet to translate into substantial wage growth. Average wages have risen 2.1 percent in the past 12 months -- not much higher than the rate of price inflation, which, as of June, was 1.8 percent (not including energy and food).Economists like Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argue that wage growth has yet to take off because there are still too many job seekers for the number of jobs available. The official unemployment rate does not account for the 6.3 million underemployed workers, who have part-time work but want to work full time, or the 668,000 jobless workers, who have given up seeking work altogether.Although the progressive groups’ petition does not explicitly demand that the Fed wait for a specific wage growth figure before raising interest rates, the Fed Up campaign and its partners have largely coalesced around a wage growth target of 3.5 to 4 percent. The liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which is participating in the new petition campaign, estimates that with that type of wage growth, price inflation will not “significantly exceed” the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target.These progressives warn that a Fed interest rate hike that occurs before significant wage growth takes hold would disproportionately hurt people of color and women. Both groups face routine discrimination in the job market that they are more likely to overcome in a high-demand economy buttressed by low rates. And people of color are much more likely to be workers on the lower side of the earnings spectrum, who have the least leverage vis-à-vis employers. That means they are often the last people to get hired or get a raise when the job market heats up, and the first to lose their jobs when it cools down. For evidence of this, they say, look no further than the shockingly high African-American unemployment rate of 9.1 percent.What About Inflation?The Fed balances its mandate to maximize employment with an obligation to prevent excessive inflation. That is why it raises interest rates when it believes prices are at or near its target inflation rate of 2 percent. Some economists also believe that even when consumer prices are below the target rate, the Fed should raise rates if housing and stock prices are getting unreasonably high.Reich -- and the many economists and activists with whom he finds common cause -- appreciate the Fed’s obligation to prevent runaway inflation. But they note that inflation has remained consistently below the Fed’s target rate of 2 percent. And they believe that for the sake of job creation and wage growth, the economy can tolerate slightly higher inflation than the current Fed target.“More jobs and better wages are more important than theoretical worries about accelerating inflation,” Reich concludes.Reich and allies point to the late 1990s as a model for Fed monetary policy. They credit then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan for refusing to raise interest rates even as the official unemployment rate dipped, against the wishes of other Fed officials concerned about inflation. As a result, wage growth was widespread enough to produce significant gains for workers at the bottom of the earnings spectrum.A New Progressive Priority?The petition campaign against a Fed rate hike is something of a coup for advocates who, as HuffPost reported at length in June, have long argued that Fed monetary policy should be a higher priority for the political left. Although the foundation-funded Fed Up campaign has been agitating for a more “pro-worker” Fed for nearly a year now, this is the first time it is collaborating with major progressive players like CREDO Action, Daily Kos and the Working Families Party. The Economic Policy Institute, which is a member of the Fed Up campaign’s founding coalition, is also activating its email list for a Fed Up petition effort for the first time.A broad array of liberal-leaning organizations joined forces in the summer and fall of 2013 to torpedo President Barack Obama’s nomination of Lawrence Summers as chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Summers united economic progressives concerned about his Wall Street ties and women’s advocates angered by his remarks about women. Their efforts succeeded in winning the appointment of Janet Yellen as chair instead of Summers.But since that time, the Fed has largely faded from the progressive foreground. Higher-profile fights like the movements for the $15 minimum wage and against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal have taken up the lion’s share of progressive energy and attention, dwarfing more esoteric causes. To the extent progressives have publicly pressured the Fed, it has been to police Wall Street more carefully, not maintain a dovish monetary policy.“In general it’s clear that the Federal Reserve gets far less attention from progressives than it should in light of the tremendous influence it has over the economy and Americans’ quality of life,” said Josh Nelson, communications director for CREDO Action.This relative inattention is evident in how little Federal Reserve monetary policy has come up in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. The topic has not been discussed widely on the campaign trail. Of the major Democratic presidential candidates, only former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley responded to a request for comment last week on a possible Fed rate hike. O’Malley agreed with progressive activists that the Fed should wait for more robust wage growth before raising rates. By contrast, the right wing has relentlessly trained its fire on the Fed for “debasing” the dollar with its quantitative easing program -- its now-defunct multitrillion-dollar asset purchasing program -- and low interest rates. Republican members of Congress regularly grill Yellen for printing too much money.To the extent that Republican presidential candidates have broached the subject, they have weighed in in support of raising rates. Donald Trump, a real estate mogul and ersatz Republican presidential candidate, warned last week that the Fed’s low interest rates are causing an asset bubble. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also slammed the Fed’s “easy money” policies for endangering the economy.But the petition effort raises advocates’ hopes that a progressive movement with the power to match the right's Fed lobby is finally taking shape. Jordan Haedtler, Fed Up's deputy campaign manager, said that CREDO Action, Daily Kos and the Working Families Party were eager to get involved.“They were very enthusiastic about targeting a new institution that was not accustomed to outside pressure by working families,” Haedtler said, adding that he thought soliciting these groups’ involvement “would be more challenging than it was.”They were receptive to the argument, Haedtler said, that the Federal Reserve can “wipe out a lot of progress” on more visible issues like the minimum wage, if the Fed “does not recognize that the economic recovery has not benefitted everybody.”CREDO Action did not specify how many activists it would target, but said that the petition would reach “many of the economic justice activists” on the group’s 3.8 million-person email list.“The traditional obscurity [of the Fed] is why we must organize around it,” CREDO Action’s Nelson said. “People assume they can't influence the Fed. But that's wrong. These are people and they are open to both pressure and input. Pointing out that many communities still suffer is an essential role for advocates.” Nelson added that progressive input is a “necessary counterweight” to Wall Street influence on the central bank.Chris Bowers, the Daily Kos’ executive campaign director, is confident that the Fed rate hike is not too esoteric for Daily Kos members. “One thing we've learned over the years is that Daily Kos readers tend to be very sophisticated, highly engaged activists who know a great deal about all manner of political issues,” Bowers said in an email. “In fact, some of our best-performing campaigns have focused on topics that might seem surprisingly obscure, such as net neutrality and filibuster reform. So we expect that our readers will readily grasp what's at stake here.” Daily Kos is soliciting signatures for the petition through a splash screen some people see when they visit the site. Bowers estimates that 20,000 people a day will see the splash over the course of a campaign that will last at least two weeks. He said Daily Kos is gauging the “intensity” of their members’ interest in the Fed based on their engagement with the petition. If enthusiasm is high, it will send the petition to its much larger email activism list.Beyond Stopping A Rate HikeUltimately, the Fed Up campaign and its allies are on a larger mission to make the Federal Reserve more accountable to working people. That means not only preventing an interest rate hike before greater wage growth takes hold, but also pushing the Fed to rebalance its dual mandate toward genuine full employment and higher wages, and away from what they believe is excessive concern about inflation. The theme of this year’s Jackson Hole symposium is “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” which Fed Up points to as a typical sign of the Fed’s inflation bias.“We want to reframe the narrative” at the symposium, Fed Up's Haedtler said. Inflation, he explains, “is not what is on the minds of low-wage workers who have been suffering through a very slow economic recovery.”“We think of our campaign less as a left/right divide, and more as an effort to bring the voices of working families to the Federal Reserve for the first time,” Haedtler noted. “Ultimately our members are fighting for a broader recovery, better wages and better working conditions.”Fed Up can point to concrete progress toward this goal since its inaugural action at the Jackson Hole symposium last August. Their protests there led to a meeting between Fed Up activists and Kansas City Fed President Esther George. That in turn opened the door to meetings with four other regional Federal Reserve bank presidents. Fed Up has also met with Yellen and several members of the Fed Board of Governors in their Washington offices.The meetings have enabled working people organized by Fed Up to share their economic experiences with Fed officials, who make decisions that will affect these people’s lives. Haedtler believes these meetings are already bearing fruit. The Fed created a Community Advisory Council in January to solicit more diverse views on the state of the economy.“Even very hawkish regional presidents -- like James Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president -- really seem to take to heart some of the stories we convey to them,” he said.The Fed Up campaign also wants to reform the selection process for regional Federal Reserve bank presidents, which it says reflects the narrow interests of the bankers that dominate their boards of directors. They are asking regional Fed presidents that they meet with for a timeline of their selection process and a list of candidates being considered. Fed Up claims credit for the Minneapolis regional Federal Reserve Bank’s decision to disclose the process through which it would select its next president.“We know something about congressionally confirmed Fed board governors, but very little about regional fed presidents, other than that they are overwhelmingly white, male and have close ties to the financial sector,” Haedtler said."
