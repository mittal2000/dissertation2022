And now she's added another: the first female whiskey sommelier at the recently opened Flatiron Room in Manhattan.Greene may be first, but she's not alone. Women all over the world are increasingly involved in the making and marketing of whiskey, not to mention the drinking of it. She gave BA an inside look at what that's meant for how she drinks and what she serves. How did you get into whiskey?Heather Greene: I am a professional keyboard player and singer/songwriter, and while on tour in Scotland I just fell in love with that whole beautiful world of whiskey. I started working at the Scotch Malt Whisky Society in Edinburgh. I just went and asked for a job. For me, whiskey making, and the passion and the sensuality that go into it, comes from that same place of creation that music does. Do you need particularly good tasting abilities in order to become a whiskey expert?HG: I was really insecure when I first started serving on the Scotch Malt Whiskey Society tasting panel. They asked me to pass a nosing and tasting exam. I was really nervous, but I passed it in a very high percentile. That gave me the courage to go back into tasting panels where it's predominantly men. That was a big moment for me because then I felt armed to talk about it. It is intimidating when you're around men. It's still intimidating. The other day I was talking to this guy about bourbon. He said: Bourbon can only be made in one region in Kentucky. I said: Actually, it can be made in more than one region. He said: Are you sure about that? I said: Yeah, I'm pretty sure about that. So he has to get up and fact-check on his phone in front of me. I thought: Would this happen with a guy? I don't think so. I've heard that women have more discerning palates. True?HG: It goes back to reasons of biology. Smell was the way women would identify appropriate mates. Right now we go into a supermarket and everything is packaged and we don't nose, like, rotten meat the way we used to. We don't rely on our nosing ability the way we used to when we used it for mating and survival. But when you coax it out of women, they will rise to the occasion. Anecdotally, for me, women outperform men.Do you think women have to be buoyed before they feel confident enough to express their whiskey opinion?HG: 100 percent. I've seen men discuss whiskey as a badge of honor. There is a feel of exclusivity to it, and they want to be in the know--just like everybody does. I think women tend to back down the way I did until I was lucky enough to take that test. Sometimes they have a great time at the tasting, but they aren't ready to make the next step to actually order it. They haven't been taught that this is acceptable. I had one woman ask if I thought ordering whiskey was an aggressive act. I always think it's really badass to see a woman ordering whiskey.HG: I do, too. But maybe it's like someone who wore like a really nice sheer lipstick and then you put red on her. She looks really good in it and she loves it, but she might not be ready to go out on the town wearing it. I don't think it will be like that for a long time, but right now we're in a transition.Why are women more involved in whiskey than ever before?HG: Like we've talked about, women do really well with nosing and whiskey. Then there's Mad Men and the advent of nostalgia in pop culture, and this return to sophistication and entertaining at home. More and more women are also writing at influential publications. Women are tastemakers and influencers and they are curious about this. There's the mixology craze. Now you have mixologists very attuned to different notes and aromas that come out of whiskey and use those notes to create beautiful cocktails. Finally, in the 1970s, women started to become included in the wine world, and now there is a huge market. You get to the point where you ask: What's next? This is the new frontier. Do you still get the whole ""Wow, you're a woman who likes whiskey!""? And are you totally sick of it?HG: Yeah, I am. Yes, I get it every night. It depends on who is asking. I think I'm more tired of it when it's before the benefit of the doubt. It's fine if it's after because there really aren't that many women in whiskey. Here's the question that really annoys me. After a whole tasting with me, a man will then ask: Do you really drink this stuff? I want to poke my eyes out with the nearest sharp object. I have gone through a lecture in front of 90 people where they ask me very detailed questions about how you cask a whiskey or aroma properties or production methods, and then we'll do a blind tasting and evaluate and someone will come up and say: Do you really drink this? It's infuriating... I fear that I'm always going to be a woman in whiskey. I just want to be a whiskey person, but it's not that way yet.There's this assumption that women need lighter whiskeys and men go for heavier ones. Do you feel that, on the flip side, men ignore some of the lighter, softer whiskeys?HG: All the time. It's funny how gender plays into whiskey. I love smoky, peaty whiskeys. I have a great private collection, and they are in there. But it's almost like having a spice cabinet with all different versions of peppers. You kind of want some of the other stuff, too, to add variety. Can you recommend three whiskeys men overlook that they shouldn't?HG: Highland and Japanese ones--and bourbons made outside of Kentucky.This story originally appeared on Bon Appétit's website.More from Bon Appétit: 10 Snacks You Thought Were Healthy But Really Aren't Make Crispy Baked Chicken Wings at Home  9 Ways to Upgrade Instant Ramen Noodles  25 Ways to Use Sriracha"
1,FOOD & DRINK,Chipotle Tofu Burritos Apparently Taste Like Breakfast Burritos,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chipotle-tofu-burrito_us_5b9cd8ace4b03a1dcc825fb3,Apparently a lot like scrambled eggs.,2013-02-21,"GLENVIEW, IL - DECEMBER 2: People enter a Chipotle restaurant December 2, 2005 in Glenview, Illinois. McDonald's Corp., owners of 92 percent of Chipotle, are preparing their Mexican-style eateries for an initial public offering. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd8ac2400005100535c3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Almost exactly a month ago, Chipotle announced that it was trying out tofu as a potential new burrito filling in seven locations in the vegan-heavy San Francisco Bay Area. The San Jose Mercury Times soon discovered that the Mexican fast casual chain was getting its tofu (sold under the ambiguous name ""Sofritas"") from an Oakland producer called Hodu Soy, which gets good Yelp reviews, so, you know, that's a solid start. But being based in New York, we haven't been able to try it ourselves.Lucky for us, SF Weekly's Mary Ladd took the plunge. Her findings? Sofritas tastes a lot like scrambled eggs. She writes:My sofritas burrito left me pleasantly full minus the requisite bloat that comes from heftier and meatier burritos in the Mission, my home neighborhood. Pitting the sofritas burrito against the Papalote soyrizo burrito -- a favorite for many vegetarians -- may be interesting if Chipotle keeps the sofritas on the menu. My burrito looked and tasted like a scrambled breakfast burrito that happens to sop up hot sauce well. A side of guac is recommended for added richness and flavor.Breakfast burritos are A-OK in our book. That said, the resemblance does make you wonder why Chipotle isn't just going with breakfast burritos. They've been available, and getting a solid response, at the Dulles Airport location of the chain in D.C., for some time. They'd appeal to the vegetarian crowd, though admittedly not to vegans. But Chipotle is already one of the most vegan-friendly chains around -- and only 0.5 percent of Americans classify themselves as vegan. So maybe Chipotle's excitement about tofu has less to do with its allegiance to the meat-averse market than it has to do with its production methods. The chain cooks much of its meat sous vide in central kitchens before shipping them to individual locations for a final touch on the grill. It would be easy to process tofu that way, but scrambled eggs? Not so much."

Oftentimes, we create blocks that stop abundance, opportunity and growth from happening.When you're living in the flow, things happen with ease. Synchronicity is all around you. Doors open, the right people appear and things fall into place. Just like that.But what happens when you step back or move in another direction out of fear or avoidance of all things uncomfortable? Blocks happen.Maybe the universe presented you with an amazing opportunity, but you convinced yourself it wasn't the right time because of money/time/family/whatever else. Then suddenly, things stopped flowing... Life felt like more of a struggle, arguments broke out and you started to feel unfulfilled, stressed out or like the world's out to get you.You have to learn how to discern between fear/avoidance and what's really, truly not right for you.It comes down to three things.1) You have to connect with your intuition.Your intuition is always speaking to you, but if you can't hear it loud and clear, you're going to miss the signs that this is or isn't right for you. If an opportunity, relationship or next step is right and in line with the natural flow of things, your intuition will know... even if the rest of you is completely freaked out by the idea.Make space to connect with your intuition. Learn to trust yourself even with your head tries to talk you in the other direction. Intuition is boss, always.So how do you connect with your intuition? You get out of your head and into your body. What do you feel in response to the situation at hand? Expansion, energy, openness? That's a yes. Tightness, resistance and tension? That's a no.Your body knows. Learn to listen.2) You must learn to get comfortable being uncomfortable.Growth, amazing experiences, authentic connection and big moves are scary. No arguments there -- but fear doesn't mean it's a no. Fear is simply excitement without the breath. Breathe into it and feel the amazing possibilities of what's next for you.You have to get uncomfortable to take yourself and your life to the next level. It's all about stretching, growing, changing and stepping up to a new level. It's not going to be easy and you have to understand that. If you can't get uncomfortable, you're going to block the flow and stay stuck exactly where you are.Sure, where you are might be just fine... but it's comfortable. It doesn't require you to stretch and grow as a human being. It doesn't help you build an amazing life around your passions, with people you deeply connect with and having amazing experiences.Stop letting fear hold you back. Take a breath and make the leap.3) You have to learn to trust the flow.Sometimes changes don't make sense or don't look exactly how we'd like them to... That doesn't mean it's not what's supposed to happen next for us. Opportunity and growth doesn't wait around until you're ready or it fits with your present life plan. It happens when it's supposed to happen.If something happens and you know in your bones that it's what's right, whether your head and heart are happy about it, you have to trust that. Release the relationships that are no longer serving you, move from the city you love when it's time, take the job opportunity that's going to throw everything you planned ""off track.""When you step back or make another decision out of fear or avoidance, you set yourself up to stay stuck for years. You may be content now -- but once the flow's been blocked, things start to unravel from within. Learn to trust.Take Action Now!Where are you blocking the flow in your life?

3,STYLE & BEAUTY,5 Reasons Why You're Not Getting (And Maintaining) Straight Hair,Dana Oliver,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/straight-hair-tips_us_5b9cd736e4b03a1dcc82522b,"For starters, are you using a cheapie blowdryer?",2013-02-21,L'Oreal Advanced Haircare Smooth Intense Polishing Shampoo ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd7351f00002c00216266.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"It's taken me a very long time to embrace the way my naturally curly hair spirals and grows in different directions. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I suffer from ""hair envy"" every now and then. And I have celebrities like Beyoncé, Jessica Alba and Eve to thank for my sudden lust for super straight hair. These red-carpet stunners have recently stepped out wearing straight hairstyles that make me wonder if they're using flat irons created by NASA. Not a single strand of hair appears to curl up in spite of standing just a few feet away from hot camera lights. Just the mere thought gets me frustrated as I recall spending hours carefully detangling my thick hair, blowdrying it section by section (and going back over spots because I've broken into a sweat) and trying my hardest to keep this sleek look for more than five days. Yet, in spite of falling short, the appeal of straight hair remains. Am I right, ladies? ""Most women want what they naturally don’t have,"" says Johnny Lavoy, celebrity hairstylist and L’Oreal Paris consulting hair expert. ""Super straight hair also appears to be healthier looking, because it reflects more light. Straight hair also adds the illusion of more length, and it’s a fairly simple way to dramatically transform your look without a haircut.""Celebs have the benefit of having a professional stylist on call to make them look picture-perfect. But here are Lavoy's five best tips on how we can get super straight hair at home:Eliminate strain and stress with the appropriate hair products. This seems like a no-brainer, however it's one of the most common straight hair styling mistakes. ""If you have hair that is curly, wavy or frizzy, you want to use a system that is going to prep the hair for its transformation,"" says Lavoy. Instead of grabbing the closest shampoo and conditioner, use hair care products that contain smoothing oils like argan which help to soften and polish unruly strands. Lavoy adds, ""If you’re straightening your hair regularly, it’s really important to use deep conditioning treatments at least once a week to prevent and repair damage."" Invest in a really good blow dryer. We've all bought that highly-discounted hair dryer on sale that promises to change our at-home blowouts forever, only to end up with way more hair damage then we started out with. And what's up with that word ""ionic"" that seems to be floating around? ""What makes these types of dryers so special is the science behind them,"" says Lavoy. ""The theory is that the ionic molecules break down the water molecule rather than just evaporate it like your standard dryer. This means the moisture is left in the hair. They also cut down on drying time and leave the hair smoother and in better condition. They cost a little more but are worth it if you’re straightening your hair often."" Flat iron with extreme caution. ""Flat irons are a great way to really get the hair super straight, but it can also cause damage if not used correctly,"" says Lavoy. Using small, one-inch sections will give you a more uniform result. It will also cut down on the amount of passes you need to go over each strand of hair, protecting it from damage. Be sure to use the right heating setting for your hair type: fine hair should be straightened on low, while thick to coarse hair should use a medium-high setting. If you're unsure about the hair straightener's temperature, test with a piece of tissue first. ""If it scorches the tissue, it’s too hot for your hair."" And always, always use a heat protecting product to provide a barrier between the tools and the hair. Take time to get a handle on your technique. It's never too late to figure out if you're blowdrying your hair wrong. Practice makes perfect! But there are two standout points Lavoy wants us all to get: When blow-drying, always use the nozzle on the end and section the hair. The nozzle will give you better results and protect your hair from direct heat. Also, grab a large round brush when smoothing out your hair. It will help smooth the cuticle and give your hair lots of shine.""Wrap"" it up to keep it up. I didn't realized how bizarre my satin bonnet hair regimen was until I decided to put it out there. But Lavoy agrees that my hair maintenance trick is key to keeping up a super sleek style. He recommends doing a ""wrap"" before you go to bed. ""What you want to do is, start to wrap your hair around your head using a brush and a couple bobby pins to keep strands in place as you work around the head,"" explains Lavoy. ""Cover it in a scarf and in the morning, just brush it out. Apply a few drops of smoothing serum and this will help lock out moisture on humid days.""Click through the slideshow below for our super straight hair styling tools and products picks.

The lakeside surrounding the town of Lazio has been a destination for well-heeled Romans for going on 400 years and these days it's positively littered with comely villas and ill-advised statuary.Tourists come to this part of Italy to see the ruins of the residence of the early Roman Emperor Domitian and to visit St. Thomas, a church built by the incomparable sculptor Bernini. The area's natural beauty and the papal residence are also big draws. A road leads up from the center of town to the pope's summer place and, come August, visitors will be able to receive a blessing from the former head of the church.Pope Benedict will be in Castel Gandolfo while the Papal Conclave takes place.

They begin when you center yourself. Before you can stretch to your limits and choose what you want to do that's difficult and worthwhile, you have to be present.",2013-02-21,Young beautiful woman doing some stretching exercises at the park,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd6a426000035007fa3fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It turns out that everything you've ever loved to do has a pattern. Every moment of zen; every experience of feeling swept away; each extraordinary, even divine moment, followed the same experiential melody. The reason most of us struggle so often to feel good in our lives is that we didn't notice when we were totally absorbed and happy. We didn't realize we were actually acting in a particular, repeatable way. Imagine you're at yoga class. You begin with some breathing. The entire goal is to relax and leave stress behind. After you ground yourself in the present moment, you begin to do poses, sometimes intensely like in Bikram, sometimes deliberate like in kundalini. Depending on the school, classes vary, but what's the same is the purpose: Yoga means ""to unite"" and the goal is to unify all parts of yourself as you breathe and flow with the movement of each position. Classes end with another time of breathing and meditation. The hope is to feel the change in your body and spirit. When you entered the class, you were likely wrapped up in the chaos of reactive living. You were doing what you were supposed to do and at the pace of others' demands and expectations. At the end of a session, however, you feel grounded and at peace with yourself and the world. The reason yoga works is that it follows the pattern of all focused human experience. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, author of Flow, describes our happiest moments. He writes, ""The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.""[1] But what most of us have not been taught is what we do to create these moments of bliss and satisfaction.Your sweet spot, the best moments of your life, follow a simple pattern. They begin when you center yourself. Before you can stretch to your limits and choose what you want to do that's difficult and worthwhile, you have to be present. Like in a yoga class, the first thing you do is choose to slow down and be where you are. This is what happens when an athlete does their ritual or routine before a serve, an at-bat, or a game. It's what musicians do when they warm up their voice or instrument. It is the chef sharpening his knives or the writer lighting a candle before words hit the page. You can't just jump into a moment of total peace and happiness, you first have to activate the part of your brain that makes happiness possible. The second key to finding your sweet spot is to focus, or orient on what's most important to you. Your sweet spot is possible because your frontal lobes, the thinking center in your brain, fire on all cylinders. If it weren't, you'd be anxious or nervous, wanting or needy. When you choose to think about or experience what you're doing right now with full attention, that's when the nerves and cravings quiet down. Doing yoga, this is focusing your mind entirely on your breathe or the feeling of your body as you move through a pose. Giving a talk, this happens when instead of worrying about whether the audience will like you, you focus on telling a great story or inviting the listener to look at things differently. When a parent soothes a child in the middle of the night, they should be miserable. They are exhausted and may not even know what's wrong. But the intentional choice to comfort a child is what creates the absorbtion and fulfillment. The parents who want to sleep will stay miserable, but parents who center after the stress of the crying, sit in a rocking chair and slowly bring the child to peace have entered their sweet spot.The final step of finding your sweet spot, however, is what yoga does so well and most of us never realized was essential. You have to self-check how you're feeling to truly register an experience as valuable. For your brain to consciously store the memories of a peak experience, to recognize an experience is worth repeating, you have to intentionally differentiate what's just happened from the moments in your life where you're reacting to what others want or a situation demands. This is what happens when you mediate at the end of yoga, or stretch after a run. It's when you write in your journal after a date to register how you really feel, or when you sit with a coach or helping professional to process a recent event. It's not about the score, the profit, or the accolades. Your sweet spot is about how you feel when you're focused and when you feel at your best. Those are the experiences you want to replicate each day.The moments we want more of in life have a formula to them. Center, focus, and self-check: These three behaviors are at the core of why yoga works and the three phases of any experience you've loved. It's the way to find precious moments in relationships and at work, when what you already do matches the formula, and how to rejuvinate experiences that need a boost by applying this way of living. Next time you feel grumpy, angry, or alone, remember you already have parts of your life where you've found your sweet spot. Now you also know how you can live each moment like it's the best yoga class you've ever taken.References:[1] Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály, Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience, New York: HarperPerennial, 1991, p. 3.For more by Jon Wortmann, click here.For more on yoga, click here.For more on happiness, click here."

This effect is usually only achieved just after cookies are removed from the oven. But what if you could make cookies that retained their gooey texture until the last crumb is consumed? Enter: No-bake cookies. Cookies that require zero time in the oven are often whipped up for health reasons -- they often feature peanut butter or oatmeal in lieu of loads of flour and sugar. But they're not just for the calorie conscious. No-bake cookies can be as tasty as their oven-warmed alternatives. We know there are chocolate chip loyalists out there, but we seriously suggest tasting these recipes, such as dulce de leche, sea salt and oatmeal cookies, or Nutella no-bakes.

Best-selling Author of ""The Sweet Spot"" & ""Raising Happiness"" ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/three-surprising-truths-a_us_5b9cd7c5e4b03a1dcc825591,"If you could ask any question of a wise and experienced neuroscientist and pediatrician, one who specializes in the secret emotional life and bizarre brain activity of your adolescent child, what would you ask?",2013-02-21,Close up portrait of a teenager's half face closing his eyes while listening to music with his headphones against a white background.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd7c52400003200535be9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you could ask any question of a wise and experienced neuroscientist and pediatrician, one who specializes in the secret emotional life and bizarre brain activity of your adolescent child, what would you ask?  I recently had the great opportunity to ask some of my burning questions -- and many that you have sent to me. Answers came from Ron Dahl, a highly acclaimed researcher and a member of the Greater Good Science Center's faculty board. Here are three surprising things I learned from our interview. (More posts to follow!)  #1: Your adolescent isn't a teenager.  Dahl avoids the term ""teenager"" because it implies that all the action is happening between the ages of 13 to 18. In truth, most girls are at the end of puberty by the age of 13.  The hormones that cause puberty -- and the behavior we typically think of as teenager-y -- start changing the brain before they start changing the body. In his research on puberty, Dahl's lab focuses on adolescents ages 9 to 13, because puberty typically lasts only two to four years.  ""In hunter-gatherer societies,"" Dahl explained to me, ""the average age of menarche [the onset of menstruation] was 17 or 18 [years old],"" because hunter-gathers typically didn't get as many calories as we do now. When you go through puberty at 18, you're an adult, and you're ready to take on adult roles. But because puberty is starting so much earlier for our kids, we have a developmental dilemma: ""If you're eight, nine, or 10 years old and you're starting to develop,"" Dahl said, ""when do you take on adult roles?""  Kids today are facing a very prolonged adolescence. What used to be a two-to-four-year period biologically is now a 15-year period culturally. The brain changes and the biological aspects of puberty start before the teenage years, but the cultural and societal aspects of adolescence don't kick in until much later.Today kids have a longer period of time to figure out who they are, to develop skills, to go to school. ""There are huge advantages to this from a learning perspective,"" Dahl told me, ""but there are also liabilities"" when the brain is developing out of sync with a kid's role in society.  #2: Kids don't necessarily want to feel happy.  ""You have this idea that people just want to be happy,"" Dahl pointed out, ""which just is not true. There are tremendous differences in what people want and like to feel."" Indulge me in the following thought experiment:  You go into a machine where you can feel anything you want to feel by playing with a set of knobs. Turn one dial a little bit and feel a little calm. Turn it a lot and feel really calm. Turn another dial and feel disgust. Another to feel joy. Every emotion imaginable is there for you to feel at any intensity, just by turning a knob.What individuals want to feel differs dramatically, and in a way, this thought experiment is running all the time in our real lives. We are continually ""turning knobs"" in our attempt to influence our emotional lives. Teenage boys typically want to turn every knob up as high as it goes, to feel a range of emotions intensely. Many people like to experience righteous anger (which is why so many people listen to Rush Limbaugh). Other people would do anything to avoid feeling their own anger.  Similarly, we all know people who are ""adrenaline junkies"" -- they like to turn the knobs on excitement. My pre-teen girls love to feel frantic excitement -- or ""hyper,"" as they put it. Brain imaging studies show that pre-adolescent boys love disgust (which explains why they can be so gross).  Though the data show that most people do prefer happiness and positive emotions to unhappiness and negative feelings, it is naïve to think that we all want to feel happy all the time.  #3: Puberty makes many kids seek conflict -- and this is a good thing. When my own pre-teen children are feeling mope-y and weepy, I try to help them feel better. ""What do you feel grateful for?"" I'll often ask. ""Let's have a dance party!"" I'll exclaim as I put on their favorite dance tunes. ""Let's go for a walk to shake this thing off!""  Uh, back off, mom.  Talking to Dahl made me realize just how unhelpful I am being. When pubescent kids are sad, for example, it's sometimes better to see them as experimenting with sadness. Instead of trying to cajole them out of it, let them learn that they can cope with even very intense negative emotions. Let them listen to sad music, call their most sad friend, and watch a movie that makes them cry. Let them deepen their sadness so that they can practice recovering from it.  Most pubescent kids like turning up the volume on their own feelings, even if their feelings aren't positive. I never really thought about this before talking with Dahl, but even intense sadness can be novel and exciting for kids.  ""This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective,"" Dahl explained. Part of the developmental task of teenagers is to learn how to control their intense emotions. ""Think about someone in a hunter-gatherer society who has to kill their first animal with a spear in order to become an adult. That is an incredibly dangerous, frightening thing. If you can't control your fear and stay on task, if you can't navigate intense feelings when the stakes are high, you might be killed yourself.""  So experimenting with intense feelings is adaptive -- it's a way to learn how to cope with them. Here's the kicker: When kids hit puberty, many start creating conflict to experiment with high-intensity behaviors and the high-intensity emotions they create.  Understanding all of this -- that my pre-teen girls, despite being only 10 and 12, are better thought of as adolescents than children, that they don't necessarily want to feel happy, that they are innately driven to do things that will make them feel bad -- makes me feel profound compassion for them.  It also makes me feel profound hope, even as they are creating conflict all around me. When I step back, I can see that they're on a path toward leading the most colorful lives they can imagine -- because they know which knobs to turn, and how far to turn them.Like this post?

Although this may seem like a no-brainer, kids run around an awful lot. When small feet are growing, the right support helps with proper foot development. But now, schools are dealing with an entirely different problem that comes with its own set of dangers: a sneaker with a wedge heel. Parents...are you kidding me?If you're an adult who wears heels, you know how uncomfortable it is. Sending girls to school with high heel wedges is absolutely unacceptable. A principal at a Los Angeles public school says ""this is a big problem and it needs to be stopped."" Girls are towering over their classmates as they teeter to class. During PE they can barely dribble a ball, let alone run a lap around the track. The principal asks ""what were their parents thinking?""Dr. Noah Blumofe, a podiatrist practicing in Los Angeles, took one look at the shoes and informed me that they are equivalent to a two-inch heel. There is great danger here, he says:When you look at heels in general, once you go ABOVE 1.5 inches, the entire dynamic of your body changes. When we walk, we go from a heel strike to full loading of the foot to pushing off the ball of the foot. When you are 2"" and above, you spend the ENTIRE time on the ball of the foot. This forces increased pressure on the ball, causing the fat pad to shift, and press on the heads of the metatarsal bones, which may cause nerve pain. Then you are causing the achilles tendon to shorten early, which is a major cause of foot pains, such as plantar fasciitis. Then it causes your pelvis to tilt, along with your entire body's alignment.Why would parents purchase these shoes? Dr. Blumofe thinks that it may be because the heel is ""hiding in an 'athletic' shoe."" They are on a shelf with other sneakers at a children's shoe store, and parents may not realize the ramifications of the purchase. When they pick up the hidden wedge heel, they are ensuring that their daughters ""will be running around on the balls of their feet."" This is unacceptable. Furthermore, This will cause an early shortening of the achilles and it will take YEARS of rehab to try and fix this problem later in life. It's easier to just not start.""Now that the principals are aware of the trend in sneaker wedge heels on elementary school campuses, they are telling students that shoes with heels of any sort are not welcome. Skechers should reconsider the entire fashion statement. Marketing heels to young children as tennis shoes should not be tolerated, sparkles and all. But parents, you are not off the hook. Dr. Blumofe is being much too generous. Can YOU play basketball in high heels?"
