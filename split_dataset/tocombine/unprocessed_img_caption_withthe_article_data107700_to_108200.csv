The Green Bay Packers' quarterback set up a game-winning touchdown pass in the final minute with a fake spike play that will seem familiar to Dolphins fans -- and any remaining supporters of the New York Jets. ""That was some freestyling right there,"" Rodgers said after the Packers' 27-24 win.With the Packers trailing the Dolphins, 24-20, and just 15 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter on Sunday at Sun Life Stadium in Miami, Rodgers acted as if he were about to spike the football to stop the clock. With most of the players on the field seeming to expect that to happen when the ball was snapped at the Dolphins' 16-yard line, Rodgers turned to his right and fired a pass to wide receiver Davante Adams, who got out of bounds to stop the clock after picking up 12 yards. On the next play, Rodgers connected with tight end Andrew Quarless on a game-winning touchdown pass with just three seconds remaining.The Packers' penultimate play was reminiscent of a trick play that Marino, the Hall of Fame quarterback who spent his entire 17-season career with the Dolphins, executed against the Jets in 1994. With the Dolphins trailing, 24-21, in the final minute of a game between the rivals, Marino yelled ""Clock, clock, clock!"" while appearing to indicate to teammates he was about to spike the ball on the ensuing play. Instead of spiking it, Marino caught the Jets by surprise with a short touchdown pass to Mark Ingram to lift the Dolphins to a 28-24 win. "
1,COLLEGE,"Colleges Are Reporting More Sexual Assaults, And That's A Great Sign",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-sexual-assault-numbers-clery-reports_n_5967412.html,,2014-10-12,"Carly Mee, a student at Occidental College, center, talks with other students during the Oxy Sexual Assault Coalition (OSAC) sexual assault awareness night campout at the college campus in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Friday, April 19, 2013. A group of Occidental students and alumni filed a Title IX complaint with the Education Department on April 18 saying the school doesnt meet federal standards for preventing and responding to rapes and other sexual assaults on campus. Photographer: Patrick Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae51cd3c000018010b6d5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this month, colleges and universities nationwide released their annual campus crime reports, and the good news is that many schools accused of mishandling sexual assault cases announced higher numbers for sexual assaults on campus.It's a positive sign, experts and advocates say, because it suggests that more victims are coming forward -- rather than that more crime is taking place. Oct. 1 was the deadline for colleges and universities to issue their annual crime reports covering 2013, which are mandated under the federal Clery Act. The reports must disclose the numbers of reported sexual assaults, drug and liquor law violations and other specific crimes within certain campus boundaries. Under-reporting violations can lead the U.S. Department of Education to order fines of up to $35,000 per error.Multiple schools stand accused of botching these numbers in the past. But some of those same schools posted significant increases in reported sex offenses in the latest Clery reports. Occidental College in Los Angeles, for example, reported 12 sexual assaults for 2011 and 11 for 2012. But in its report released this month, the school noted 64 reports of sexual violence. ""We believe this substantial increase over last year's number is primarily due to increased awareness of Title IX issues and of reporting and support options at the College,"" Occidental said in a campuswide announcement. ""Of the 64 reports made in 2013, 34 involved conduct that occurred prior to 2013.""Caroline Heldman, an Occidental professor who has been critical of the college's handling of sexual violence, similarly told HuffPost that a ""survivor-led campaign for better reporting and transparency at Occidental College means we are finally seeing more accurate Clery numbers for sexual violence.""The Clery Act was passed in 1990 to highlight problems of campus crime. But since rape and other sexual assaults are notoriously under-reported, Clery statistics have failed to present a true picture of those crimes. Now the accuracy of those numbers may be improving.Over the past three years, the number of sexual assaults disclosed in Dartmouth College's annual Clery report has risen. Dartmouth reported 15 for 2011, 24 for 2012 and 35 for 2013.The higher numbers were due to the fact that ""we have strengthened the climate for reporting on campus,"" said Dartmouth spokeswoman Diana Lawrence. ""We want the number of reports from sexual assault survivors to go up, but the prevalence to go down,"" she said. Even though the Ivy League school has been on the receiving end of a lot of criticism over the last few years for how it responds to victims of sexual violence, experts and advocates largely agree with Dartmouth's explanation for why its crime figures have jumped. Seeing higher numbers in annual crime reports for sexual violence means the campus is ""breaking that culture of silence,"" said Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security on Campus.Other schools previously under fire showed similar increases in their latest reports. Sexual assaults at the University of California-Berkeley rose from 23 in 2012 to 33 in 2013. Sex offenses at the University of Southern California increased from 24 in 2011 to 33 in 2013. Harvard University's rape and forcible fondling numbers ticked up to 40 in 2013 from 26 two years earlier. The University of Connecticut's number is up from eight in 2011 to 25 in 2013.Some other criticized schools, including the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Amherst College, posted drops in their numbers. What actually concerns the experts is seeing a school report that it had no sex offenses on campus in a given year, which nearly half did for 2012. The real number is highly unlikely to be zero, given that an estimated 1 in 5 women will experience a completed or attempted sexual assault by the time they finish college.""We will have institutions say, 'This doesn't happen here' or 'It's not an issue at my campus' -- that's a huge red flag,"" Kiss said.Annie Clark, co-founder of the survivor advocacy group End Rape on Campus, agreed that the reporting of few or no assaults is suspicious. Even if low numbers reflect no active effort to present a rosy picture, Clark said, they still shows that students don't feel comfortable disclosing assaults.""I would say Clery data is very limiting in terms of what it's able to report or convey,"" Clark said. ""A campus climate survey [of a school's students] would give you a much more accurate picture of what's happening.""But that doesn't mean a school can't improve the accuracy of its Clery statistics or that only universities under intense scrutiny are reporting higher numbers now.The University of Iowa saw its reported sex offenses nearly triple over three years, from 7 in 2010 to 20 in 2012. It is also issuing timely notices of sexual assault reports through campuswide emails -- seven so far this fall semester.Iowa's notices provide information about how to report sexual violence, which has changed over time to include less emphasis on risk reduction strategies and more on bystander intervention. That was done in response to student feedback, according to Monique DiCarlo, Iowa's deputy Title IX coordinator. The university spent months considering that language with input from various groups on campus, DiCarlo told HuffPost. ""If you can coordinate things so it's not who's more right but how can we be right together,"" DiCarlo said, ""your intervention and prevention efforts are going to be better.""More colleges should engage in those kinds of discussions, said Laura Dunn, founder of SurvJustice, a nonprofit advocacy group for sexual assault victims.""My suggestion to schools who want to increase reporting and fear the negative blowback is frame the message yourself,"" said Dunn, who argues that if schools acknowledge and openly discuss sexual assault, they can persuade more victims to come forward.Ultimately, those discussions may help move a campus community toward an actual decrease in the incidence of sexual violence.""I couldn't do this if I didn't believe that it would look different by the time my 9-year-old daughter comes to college,"" DiCarlo said. ""I believe we can prevent the problem. There's a commitment -- that's what it's going to take."""

Other participating schools include:Andover Newton Theological School (Newton Centre, Mass.)Catholic University of America (Washington, D.C.)Columbia Theological Seminary (Decatur, Ga.)Concordia Seminary (St. Louis)Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg (Pennsylvania)Jesuit School of Theology at Santa Clara University (Berkeley, Calif.)Multnomah Biblical Seminary (Portland, Ore.)Wake Forest University School of Divinity (Winston-Salem, N.C.)Working with the Association of Theological Schools — the main umbrella group for U.S. seminaries — organizers received 28 letters of interest from seminaries interested in the pilot program.The grants will cover faculty, events, science resources, guest speakers and other related costs. Seminaries could incorporate applicable issues of modern technology, methods of science or the history of science into courses seminary students already take, such as church history, ethics, pastoral counseling or systematic theology.“There are interesting intersections of all these types of courses with either modern science or the history of science or the philosophy of science that would be very useful for these students to become acquainted with,” Wiseman said.AAAS will provide seminaries with resources, including a series of short science-education videos. The association will help to recruit scientist-advisers from nearby science research institutions.The new project, Science for Seminaries, will also organize conferences for Catholic, mainline Protestant and conservative/evangelical Protestant seminaries.The survey from AAAS also suggested potential conflict between religion and science. Twenty-two percent of scientists (and 20 percent of the general public) say religious people are hostile to science. On the flip side, 22 percent of the general population thinks scientists are hostile to religion, and of those who feel science and religion are in conflict, 52 percent sided with religion.A survey earlier this year by The Associated Press found that religious identity — particularly those who are evangelical Protestant — was one of the sharpest indicators of skepticism toward key issues in science.Of those surveyed, 51 percent of American adults, including 77 percent of evangelicals, have little or no confidence that “the universe began 13.8 billion years ago with a big bang.” And 36 percent overall (compared with 56 percent of evangelicals) doubt that “the Earth is 4.5 billion years old.”Those who are religious are often interested in learning how science can be used for the common good, Wiseman said.“Having these conversations is important, but developing the platform and architecture for them is sometimes complicated,” Wiseman said. “Science can be unifying to many people in society, both people of faith and people who don’t share that faith, and yet through what we’re learning in science, I think we can come together to use that knowledge for great good.”"

GET THE RECIPE4. Autumn Carrot & Sweet Potato SoupMade with carrots, sweet potatoes, apples and honey, this savory soup with a hint of sweetness and spice tastes just like fall in a bowl. The secret ingredient is curry powder, which doesn't give the soup an Indian flavor like you might think, but instead lends a subtle hint of autumn spice. GET THE RECIPE5. French Lentil & Vegetable Soup with BaconYou'll love this elegant lentil soup for its many layers of flavor: the smokiness of the bacon, earthiness of the lentils, mild sweetness of the onions and carrots, and acidity of the tomatoes.

The service, that attracted nearly 150 attendees, was dedicated to Thomas Eric Duncan who died Wednesday at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas from complications of Ebola. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f1052100000001c91bbb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If Thomas Eric Duncan, for whatever reason, had not gotten on an airplane from Monrovia, Liberia, to Dallas, Texas, he would have become another nameless, faceless person who died of Ebola in Liberia. But because he did get on the plane -- unaware that he already was infected with the deadly disease -- he has put a face on a disease we Americans have tried hard to ignore.Others can debate who knew what when or whether this gentle-hearted man should have been allowed on the plane or not. That's not mine to decide. What matters to me is that because he did board that plane, Eric Duncan entered my own life and the life of my church, even though none of us had the chance to meet him personally.Eric Duncan -- the man who days before boarding that plane had selflessly aided a pregnant woman in medical distress, much like the Good Samaritan of the Gospels -- came to Dallas to marry a member of the congregation where I serve as senior pastor. He came to reunite with Louise Troh, who was baptized in our church earlier this year and is a regular participant in the life of the church.After learning that Eric was connected to Louise and that Louise and her family were being placed in quarantine because he had fallen ill in her apartment, my first question was, ""Could I visit her?"" Somehow, instinctively, I sensed that in times like these, the role of a pastor is to be present. I wish I could say that I was intentionally following the example of Jesus, who said to his followers, ""When I was in prison, you visited me; when I was sick, you comforted me."" There was no time to stop and think of Bible verses and parables. This moment required fast thinking and hard decisions.Looking back, perhaps those well-worn Bible stories did offer guidance because they had been hidden in my heart by godly parents and kind Christians from my childhood. And what I discovered along the way was that members of my own Dallas congregation apparently had internalized these biblical examples as well, because to a person the church has supported me in reaching out to Louise and her family. The only criticisms we have received have come from outside the church.Ebola came to our church, even though no one was exposed to the virus inside our building. We encountered Ebola because one of our members came face-to-face with it. And to echo the words of the Apostle Paul, when one member of the body hurts, the entire body feels pain.Apparently, this is an image that is shocking for much of America to see and hear. Few people expected a predominantly Anglo congregation in an affluent section of Dallas to stand by a Liberian immigrant forced to live in quarantine. But as those inside our congregation know, this is what we do. This is what it means to be a church.Every day, each of us faces decisions about whether to exclude or include, whether to remove ourselves from other people or to draw closer to other people. How we make those decisions often turns on how we have been taught. Rodgers and Hammerstein got it right in their 1949 Broadway musical, ""South Pacific,"" with the song, ""You've Got to be Carefully Taught."" Lieutenant Cable famously sings: ""You've got to be taught to hate and fear. You've got to be taught from year to year. It's got to be drummed in your dear little ear. You've got to be carefully taught.""What we've learned in recent weeks is that there's a flip side to this truth as well: When we're carefully taught to love rather than hate, when we're carefully taught to care rather than shun, it shows up in our actions. And in times of crisis -- like when Ebola comes to church -- what we've been taught pops into full view.We've seen this lived out in Dallas by our mayor, Mike Rawlings, and our top county official, Clay Jenkins. Both these elected officials spontaneously acted in ways that not only offered compassion but inspired others to be compassionate. They knew you've got to be carefully taught.The lesson we all need to learn now is another biblical teaching: We are, in fact, our brother's keeper. Because Eric Duncan got on that plane and came to Dallas, we put a face and a name and a life story and hopes and dreams with the tragedy of Ebola. Because he came to Dallas, Ebola was no longer someone else's problem; it became our problem.We need to be carefully taught, once again, the old African proverb: ""I am because we are.""______________George Mason is senior pastor of Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas.

Hymavathi, the special commissioner for disaster management for Andhra Pradesh state, told Reuters by telephone.Streets in Vizag that had been bustling on Saturday were deserted as shrill, roaring winds lashed the city, smashing windows and damaging buildings. With power out, many people had to resort to back-up generators.Vizag port suspended operations on Saturday night, with the head of the port saying that 17 ships which had been in the harbor were moving offshore where they would be less at risk from high seas.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) rated Hudhud as a very severe cyclonic storm that could pack gusts of 195 km/h and dump more than 24.5 cm (10 inches) of rain in some places when it makes landfall.As of 6:30 a.m. (0200 GMT) the cyclone was located 100 km (63 miles) southeast of Vizag.""We are constantly monitoring. We are calling it a severe cyclonic storm. We are expecting the landfall around noon today,"" B.P. Yadav, head of the National Weather Forecasting Center at the IMD, told Reuters.The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), run by the United Nations and the European Commission, forecast even higher peak wind speeds of 212 km/h. That would make Hudhud a Category 4 storm capable of inflicting ""catastrophic"" damage.Around 150,000 people were evacuated on Saturday in Andhra Pradesh to high-rise buildings, shelters and relief centers, authorities said. On Sunday, some in districts less at risk were allowed to return home. 'HIGH HUMANITARIAN IMPACT'Thousands more were moved to safety further north in the state of Odisha.Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal are common at this time of year. These often cause deaths, mass evacuations of coastal villages, disruption of power and phone services as well as damage to crops and property in eastern India and Bangladesh.The cyclone was strong enough to have a ""high humanitarian impact"" on nearly 11 million people, the GDACS said in an updated bulletin.The IMD forecast a storm surge of 1-2 meters above high tide that could result in flooding of low-lying coastal areas around Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam.The evacuation effort was comparable in scale to the one that preceded Cyclone Phailin exactly a year ago, and which was credited with minimizing fatalities to 53.

The high-tech museum will be in the restored and adapted Washington Design Center, a former refrigeration warehouse, with plans for a floor-to-ceiling interactive media wall and a ""Drive Through History,"" described as a ""high-definition sensory ride offering dynamic encounters with great people, places and events that changed the world.""Purchased in less than five years, the collection includes such artifacts as the earliest known form of a Jewish prayer book, first editions of the King James Bible, and several previously unpublished New Testament fragments on papyrus.The museum will also house the world's largest private collection of Jewish Torah scrolls and the Codex Climaci Rescriptus with the world's largest body of Christian Palestinian Aramaic, which is close to the language that Jesus Christ spoke.Scholars are concerned that the museum will feature only a Protestant interpretation of the Bible in its areas devoted to the book's impact and narrative.Scholars had vastly different interpretations of everything in the Bible, said John Kutsko, executive director of the Society of Biblical Literature in Atlanta. There are different versions of the text used in Jewish, Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox services, as well as secular versions, he noted.""What we hope it can accomplish in name, in purpose and in plan, is that it is a Museum of the Bibles, plural,"" Kutsko said.""In terms of sheer numbers, it's massive,"" he said of the collection.Hobby Lobby and the Green family drew headlines in June when the Supreme Court ruled that the Oklahoma-based craft store chain and Conestoga Wood Specialties of Pennsylvania could refuse to cover contraceptives in their employees' health insurance due to the religious beliefs of their owners.Green had originally planned his museum for Dallas, but set his sights on Washington after a survey of the 10 biggest U.S. metropolitan areas showed a museum there would draw the biggest crowds.TRAVELING DISPLAYAbout 400 artifacts have been in a traveling display called ""Passages,"" now in Springfield, Missouri. The exhibit includes a ""special Noah's Ark experience"" for children and holograms and video screens that re-enact historical scenes related to the Bible, according to the show's website.Rachel Lindsey, associate director of the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis, called ""Passages"" ""absolutely Protestant"" in its view of the Bible's accessibility and openness to interpretation.But she said the Museum of the Bible could open up discussion about how the text has been adopted over the centuries by a wide range of people and movements.""There's an opportunity for the museum to really expose the multiplicity of the Bible in American history,"" Lindsey said.

11,HEALTHY LIVING,Want to Be Healthier? Get Happy First,"Chris Freytag, ContributorNational fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention ma...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/happiness_b_5915322.html,"Happiness, health and success are three things most of us want. The old school of thought is if you chase success and achieve it, you will be happy (however you define it). Turns out, that's backward.",2014-10-11,2014-10-01-DancingWomaninBlueDressandHeadphones.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-01-DancingWomaninBlueDressandHeadphones-thumb.jpg,"Happiness, health and success are three things most of us want. The old school of thought is if you chase success and achieve it, you will be happy (however you define it). Turns out, that's backward. Happiness researcher Shawn Achor has found that if you are happy (first), you are more likely to be successful. It makes sense, doesn't it? Happy people are generally more positive and energetic. Happy people see possibilities everywhere and are super productive. Happy people have that ""can do"" or ""I will try it"" spirit. If your happiness can direct your life to reach success, guess what else your happiness can do for you? It can make you healthy. Yep. I am sure you've heard lots of promises in your lifetime of how you can get a healthier lifestyle, but happiness can really do the trick. Here are three reasons why.1) When you are happy, it's easier to make smarter choices about food. Have you ever heard of a person who was an emotional eater because she was so happy? I haven't either. Food is often used as a source of comfort to stuff stress, a bad day, a major life change, or anxiety of some sort. If you are in a happy place, it's easier to have a healthier relationship with food. You eat to nourish. You eat to energize. You splurge on some ice cream to celebrate a big win in your life and you enjoy every bite guilt-free. You have better control over your food choices, because your happiness is already coming from other sources. You aren't trying to fill a feeling of emptiness.2) Happy people realize what they eat affects their mood. Ever overindulged in fast food or comfort food (think grandma's mac n' cheese) and afterward, as you are moaning and holding your stomach, ask yourself what you were thinking? You feel stuffed and sluggish. We all know this, but it's good to remember that what you put in to your body is how you feel on the outside. If you put in healthy, fresh ingredients full of nutrients, you will feel healthy and fresh! If you put in junk, you are going to feel like junk. Feed your body healthy ingredients to feel healthy. As author and activist Michael Pollan says, ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" Sounds simple, but his philosophy works. 3) Happy people have discovered the clean eating-happiness link. The idea behind clean eating is to eat simply. You don't need lots of heavy sauces or sweeteners to make your food taste delicious, you just need fresh and real ingredients. And that doesn't mean you are trading your love of food for bland and boring. When I eat clean, I enjoy my food more because I know it's producing fuel for energy, exercise, disease prevention and good health. Clean eating is about homemade meals with fresh ingredients, lots of veggies and good for you fats like avocado, olive oil, dark chocolate (at least 70 percent cacao) and nuts. I've got tons of free clean eating recipes of my own and from friends on my website... you've got to see how delicious eating for your health can be. 4) Happy people have discovered the exercise-happiness link. Lots of happy people are regular exercisers. This isn't a coincidence. Exercise boosts mood. Research published in the American Psychological Association indicates that exercise can help ward off depression and make people more mentally resilient. When you do something and it makes you happy, you kind of want to do it again, right? Once you find an exercise you love and get in the habit, it becomes difficult to stop doing it because you see how much of a giant mood booster exercise can be. I even have talked to lots of moms who say their hour of alone time exercising is what retains their sanity and keeps them happy. Exercise becomes me time and escape time, and you get all of its benefits. Exercise curbs the stress hormone cortisol. Exercise gives you happy endorphins, mental clarity, and a great sense of personal pride and accomplishment. Once you become exercise hooked, you will realize how closely your happiness is tied in to your workouts. 5) Happy people are willing to try new things. When you are happier, there's a better chance you are willing to try a new workout, experiment with a new recipe or set a new goal or challenge yourself. Your desire to try new things or be better than you were yesterday keeps you striving, and that mindset makes for a happier and healthier you. My Rx for you is to BE HAPPY. Then you can get healthy. Fight for your happiness, because the prize is your good health."
12,WORLDPOST,The Role Of The Kurds In The Fight Against ISIS,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kurds-iraq-syria_n_5960428.html,,2014-10-11,"Iraqi Kurdish soldiers pause from combat to make tea near to the front line in Mahmoudiyah, Iraq, a day after they take control of the village from the Islamic State group, as they patrol on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2014. Iraqi Kurdish fighters on the front lines of battle say they have yet to receive the heavy weapons and training pledged by the United States and nearly a dozen other countries to help them push back the Sunni militants. Without more sophisticated weaponry, the Kurdish fighters, known as peshmerga, have had to rely on aging arms like the Soviet-era cannons, a centerpiece of the offensive Tuesday to retake Mahmoudiyah. (AP Photo/Hadi Mizban)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13eb42400003600382320.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Peter W. Galbraith on the role of Kurds in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. As the fight of the U.S.-led coalition against militants of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq continues, the group's brutal assault on the town of Kobani on the Syrian-Turkish border has turned the world's attention to the plight of the Kurds. The battle for Kobani has been emblematic of much of the fighting against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, where outgunned Kurdish forces find themselves as the frontline defense against militant advances. The WorldPost spoke with author, academic and former adviser to the Kurdistan Regional Government Peter W. Galbraith about the role of the Kurds in the region. Kobani is currently in dire threat of falling to Islamic State militants. What would that mean for the Kurds? For the Kurds in Kobani it means massacres, torture and great cruelty. The Kurds are saying ISIS has declared them to be infidels, and they kill infidels, so it really is a life and death battle for people there. It certainly would also be a major blow to President Obama's strategy, and one that is still preventable by using intensive airstrikes.Do you foresee any Turkish aid or involvement in Kobani? Well time is running out. I would hope that the Turkish government would see the opportunity that exists helping defend Kobani. It would keep ISIS off the border, and if Kobani is defended it means 200,000 refugees will return home. It would also promise to open a new chapter between the Turkish government and the PYD [The Kurd's Democratic Union Party] and its ally the PKK [Kurdish Worker's Party, a militant group]. Erdogan has already established a very close and good relationship with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq and this is an opportunity to radically change things in Turkey.What level of unity is there between the Kurdish groups?In regards to political parties, the PKK in Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq have been fierce opponents. The PKK attacked the Iraqi Kurds in the 90s, so there's no love between them. The Syrian Kurds, the PYD, are aligned with the PKK. That said, there is a greater sense of shared Kurdish identity that has led both Kurdistan Regional Government President Barzani and Salih Muslim, the leader of the Syrian Kurds, to call for these differences to be set aside. What is the longterm goal of the Kurds? There are different aims in different places. The Kurds in Turkey want to be full and equal citizens and have the right to use their own language, to have education in their own language, to be full participants in Turkish life.The PYD in Syria speaks of a federal democratic Syria, but the Kurdish population would like to have a separate region with de facto independence the way the Iraqi Kurds have. The Iraqi Kurds have de facto independence and they would like to have legal independence. I do think an independent Kurdistan in Iraq is likely, but not in Turkey and who knows what's going to happen in Syria.How do you assess the level of support that Kurds are receiving?There have been some airstrikes, but not enough. The trouble for the defenders of Kobani is that they have Kalahsnikovs and bullets but they're up against American Humvees and American guns, artillery and tanks. So, it's very hard to defend in those circumstances. Also, we're allies with Turkey and we should really be insisting that they permit arms to go the defenders of Kobani. In regards to Iraq, the United States and other countries have done a good job of flying in weapons, but there need to be more sophisticated weapons. The Kurds specifically need armored helicopters and mine resistant armored personnel carriers.What are Kurdish leaders saying about the situation?They're determined to defend Kurdistan but they need help. They need airstrikes. They need weapons. They are proud to be what America hoped all of Iraq would be, but what it isn't.This interview took place on Tuesday, Oct. 7. It has been edited and condensed for clarity. In addition to being a former adviser to the KRG, Peter W. Galbraith has previously had business and financial interests in Kurdistan."

Nov. 27, 1998 marks the 20th anniversary of the assassination of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. (AP photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcf0e24000030009698bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Harvey Milk said in 1978:Gay brothers and sisters, you must come out. Come out to your parents. I know that it is hard and will hurt them, but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth! Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers, to the people who work where you eat and shop. Come out only to the people you know, and who know you, not to anyone else. But once and for all, break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.I think about Harvey's impassioned plea quite often. It whispers in my brain with both inspiration and reservation -- inspiration because, as an out woman, I have experienced what only coming out will teach you, that life is significantly more reliable and fruitful without secrets and shame, and reservation because, as a Christian, I also know that coming out and purging all secrets can be a dangerous, painful prospect. I know that it is not as simple as pushing folks into a river of deadly rapids with a promise of rest on the distant shore. The reality is that not everyone survives the journey. Not everyone who takes the plunge is a strong swimmer. Worse yet, there are plenty who are more than willing to follow you into the deep just to push your head under, into suffocating silence. When asked what prescription I'd give to an LGBT Christian on the necessity, urgency or even obligation to come out, I lack Milk's confidence in insisting that all LGBT people identify themselves. Maybe it's the burden of my pessimist nature, but to those in earshot of anti-gay religious voices, I usually say, ""It does get better, but make sure you prepare for the crossing."" Somewhere along the way, particularly in religious environments, coming out is an act more along the lines of a confession than a natural step toward self-awareness. The result is that it makes me think long and hard before I insist that every LGBT person show their hand, knowing for certain that the church still packs a punch. It's so very difficult for the average person to hold the ground of what they know to be true about themselves against an onslaught of biblical magnitude that can be both confusing and demeaning. The reality is that most people aren't gay because it's a statement of style; it's just one portion, one quality that helps complete the picture of their own identity. Yet we live in a time when coming out often requires that one be prepared to defend their position, as if it is in some way a political statement or a religiously justifiable way of being. We are asked to debate what is, in the end, ultimately undebatable. Most of us start out with little more than the story of how we just ""know."" It's the story, and it's all we've got.I was 4 years old when Harvey Milk spoke those words. I had yet to hear them when, at the ripe old age of 27, I realized I'm actually lesbian. While I stared into the darkness of the closet that so many people insisted was my certain destiny, I was fortunate because, decades before, Harvey Milk, a gay man, had asked his friends, his family, his neighbors and, ultimately, the world to break the devastating chains of LGBT silence. I cannot imagine how I might have fared without the courage of those who came before me, who risked so much by coming out in times when the costs were so assured and so great. It is because of every single person who has come out that today I have the privilege -- though it may not always be easy -- to speak of my own sexual orientation with more ease than arguably any generation that has come before me. Perhaps this is the hidden wisdom of Milk's charge, revealed only by what experience and time can teach us: that there is nothing more disarming to prejudice than looking into the eyes of and knowing the names of those we harm. For however much sexual orientation and gender identity will be debated, investigated or legislated, there is no more insightful evidence than that of the truth we carry in the story of our lives being lived out in the open. In the 36 years since Harvey encouraged the veil to be pulled back, we have revealed, not just to the heterosexual community but to ourselves, that human sexuality is in actuality as fluid and diverse in expression and identity as the people it inhabits. We are in fact doctors, mothers, pastors, children, cross dressers, truckers, artists, politicians and more. Evidence suggests that orientation and gender are not merely expressions of sexual choices but more likely the mysterious makings of what we call humanity. The more the story is told, the less power the stereotypes and myths have to limit our potential. The ignorance of the dark closet gives way to vibrant life, of whole beings, of good mental, physical and spiritual health. Once we dare to speak of what causes us fear, whether gay or straight, we now know that we are less inclined to punish or harm ourselves. In the light of day, we can find community that shares in celebrating our unique traits, disarming those who once ridiculed us.You see, this is where Milk's charge broke the barrier of being solely a political call to action and tripped into the territory of enduring wisdom: in the idea that if one does not speak, one will never be heard. He reminded us that silence is an anchor, and that it is impossible for any human being to have a full life bound in chains.As National Coming Out Day approaches on Oct. 11, I'm grateful for both the discomfort and inspiration that Milk gave for me to consider. For behind every political yearning for equality, behind every taboo that has ever been broken, at the core of any religious belief worth its salt, the one challenge that we all universally share is the need to be accepted as we are found. It's important to take a moment, at least one day a year, to put aside viewing coming out as a political statement or an act of religious rebellion. I would argue that it's not just a gay rite of passage. Learning to love yourself and to love others, however and whoever they confess themselves to be to you -- that, to me, is a universal kinship we all share. To accept and be accepted. To be treated with equal opportunity, respect and dignity, one neighbor known to the other."
