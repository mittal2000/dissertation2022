Berlin is still a Gothic center today, at least in the corsets and fishnets sense.I have a number of spooky friends in the German capital, and they brought me to their favorite haunts. In this travel video, we explore Berlin's darkest clubs and fashion. Bizarre nightlifeMy visit coincided with Berlin Fetish Weekend, an annual celebration of leather and latex with events throughout the city. I went to monthly ""play party"" Angel-in-Bondage, which features a hot tub, shower and massage room. Even if you don't partake in the adult activities -- we stuck to the industrial dance floor -- the night is well-run and welcoming.The Japanese alt community meets regularly at Anko-kai in Club der Polnischen Versager. I watched pantless organizer Nobu dance a modern butoh, under neon projections. DJ SiSEN, a cyber-Goth cult figure, recently moved to Tokyo from Berlin. He belongs to an underground collective called Japaranoia, which hosts ""dark and strange"" parties. Most take place at Eschschloraque, a club decorated with jars of alien babies. However the ""most frightening bar"" award goes to Last Cathedral. It's hard to be grave here when the benches look like tombstones, and glowing ghosts peer from the walls. Punk and Goth shopsAlt clothing stores are a-plenty, especially around Alexanderplatz. Mystica  and XtraX specialize in old-school deathrock fashion, like skeleton jackets and stomper boots. Savage Store stood out for elegant latex wear. My Berlin shopping guide has details about these shops and more. Alternative artI was fortunate to be in Berlin during the Biennale for Contemporary Art. A friend took me to ""Draftsman's Congress,"" an interactive installation at St Elisabeth Church. Each day, the walls changed as people added their own drawings. I picked up a brush, climbed the ladder and painted my earless cat. Avant-garde works are on display at 5th people project, a gallery that focuses on independent artists. If you're fond of Rococo and Baroque decadence, as I am, Potsdam is an inspiration. The architecture of Sans Souci, summer palace of Frederick the Great, took me back to 18th-century court life. Where to stayI recommend staying in a short-term rental in a central district. My Oh Berlin apartment in Charlottenberg had a full kitchen and space to entertain, and the walls were filled with paintings. Are you intrigued by Berlin's underground culture? What do you think of the Goth spots highlighted in the video?Video by La Carmina. Danke to Go With Oh and Yukiro Dravarious. "
1,MONEY,Obama Student Loan Repayment Program Helps Higher Earners: Study,Catherine New,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-student-loan-repayment-plan_us_5b9c69dae4b03a1dcc7e744b,"Under the current program, a law school graduate who has around $122,000 in federal loans and a starting salary of $65,000",2012-10-16,"FILE-In this May 20, 2011, file photo, graduates from various institutions toss their hats in the air in Philadelphia.

In 2010 President Obama asked Congress to alter the program by lowering of the percentage of income for repayment to 10 percent from the current 15 percent, and putting a cap on the paydown period at 20 years, rather than 25 years, for loans originating in July 2014 or after. That may sound like good news for borrowers, but it turns out to be much better deal for kids who already have a leg up in the work force, according to a new report from the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan policy think tank. Instead, the report found that the program ""is set to provide huge financial windfalls to people who, far from being in need, are among the most financially well-off graduates in today’s job market."" How much of a windfall? It could mean a law school borrower writing off as much as $160,000 of debt, the report said. Under the current program, a law school graduate who has around $122,000 in federal loans and a starting salary of $65,000 that grows to $200,000 in 20 years will be able to write off about $23,000 of his or her debt at the end of the pay-down period. With the new program, the borrower will repay only about half as much, and the government will forgive more than $160,000 of the outstanding debt, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported.The one-size-fits-all policy will also lower loan payments by borrowers making less than $25,000 in annual salary between $5 and $20 per month, according to the report. But it's middle-class kids who could get the shortest end of the stick under the new program. According to the report, middle-income earners who start with salaries under $33,000 and later earn $63,000 or more for the majority of their repayment period, ""will actually pay more and for longer due to the pending changes.""“The design of the plan has the potential to misdirect some of the subsidies towards people who will be earning fairly substantial incomes,” Mark Kantrowitz, founder of finaid.org, a website about college finances, told the New York Times. “The improvements don’t benefit the low-income students as much as the high-income students.”The Obama administration, along with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, want to get more people into the income-based repayment program, but so far less than 3 precent of borrowers actually use the program, according to Bloomberg. One reason the program has not been better utilized is that it has not been promoted by lenders who will lose income if borrowers make smaller payments. The application process is also overly complicated, according to Time. However, following a report on student loans released on Tuesday, the CFPB is recommending more incentives to help more students get into income-based repayment programs.But the real loser here could actually be the government. Citing lower salaries and an extremely tough job market, a story in American Lawyer  suggested that ""the likelihood that the government will be forced to cancel large amounts of law school debt in 20-25 years is high."""

The same tactics that mortgage borrowers have faced are now happening for student loan borrowers, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The government watchdog on Tuesday released its annual report on student loans, including details from a database of complaints that opened to student loan borrowers in March. “Student loan borrower stories of detours and dead ends with their servicers bear an uncanny resemblance to problematic practices uncovered in the mortgage servicing business,” CFPB student loan ombudsman Rohit Chopra said in a statement. Nearly two-thirds of the 2,857 complaints filed in the database had to do with repayment issues, including complaints about fees, billing, deferment, forbearance and fraud. Thirty percent of the complaints were about problems facing borrowers unable to pay. Few were related to getting a loan.The report highlighted three servicing issues of particular concern: Surprises in loan terms and conditions; the runaround from servicers and difficulty contacting a person; and problems refinancing loans to take advantage of historically low interest rates.Chopra called Tuesday's report an ""early warning"" for servicing problems how they may hurt borrowers' ability to repay.The CFPB over the summer compared loan servicing problems in the student loan industry with the subprime mortgage industry. Much like the mortgage industry, the student loan industry underwent a huge borrowing boom from 2004 to 2008, according to the CFPB. Student loan debt is now more than $1 trillion and private loans account for $150 billion of that amount. At least $8 billion of private loans are in default by about 850,000 borrowers, according to the report. Unlike a mortgage, however, student loan borrowers cannot discharge their debt in bankruptcy.Chopra said many complaints in the CFPB database related to loans that originated before 2008. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 required better disclosure of fees on private loans. The majority of complaints were directed at the seven biggest lenders. Sallie Mae, the biggest private lender for student loans, received the most complaints. The database does not currently include complaints about federal student loans.The report included the CFPB's recommendations for policy changes to help borrowers manage their debt. Recommendations include helping more borrowers refinance to lower rates and creating incentives for income-based repayment programs. Brendon McQueen, the 29 year-old-founder of San Francisco-based Tuition.io, an online dashboard for managing student loan payments, said servicing issues are a huge problem. McQueen, who owes $120,000 in student loans himself, said the biggest frustration he sees is a lack of communication from servicers. ""Just an email that your loan was sold and who to contact"" would help, McQueen said. ""That just isn't happening."""

We've been clear that warrants weren't needed,"" Paul Cirel, of the firm Collora LLP in Boston, said in a statement.The entrance to NECC's headquarters - a squat, nondescript brown brick building - was cordoned off with yellow ""caution"" tape.An officer with the Framingham motorcycle unit guarded the front door. Lights were on inside, and a number of people, including uniformed agents, were seen moving around inside the facility into the night.The FDA's criminal unit, the Office of Criminal Investigations, is a team of agents with specialized knowledge and training to investigate violations of food and drug laws. It pursues about 1,200 criminal cases each year.The raid came as a leading U.S. lawmaker called for an investigation of whether the compounding pharmacy violated federal laws covering potentially addictive drugs.The U.S. meningitis outbreak is widening. A 16th death was announced on Tuesday, a patient from southwest Virginia, that state's Department of Health said in a statement.Overall, there are 231 confirmed meningitis cases, according to Tuesday's tally from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an increase of 19 on the day.""We will see more patients reporting in ill and we'll have to treat many more,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said on ""CBS This Morning.""The FDA on Monday widened its investigation of the cause of the fungal meningitis outbreak to other drugs made by NECC.Nearly 14,000 people nationwide are at risk of infection because they received injections from suspect steroid medications shipped to 76 facilities in 23 states.Besides the meningitis cases, two additional patients have a different type of fungal infection from injections in their joints (as opposed to back injections).Massachusetts Democratic Representative Edward Markey, a senior member of the committee that oversees business, called on the Justice Department to investigate whether NECC violated federal laws designed to stem illegal activity in controlled drugs.The company already faces multiple investigations by the FDA and several states, but Markey's request could launch an even more serious probe involving the Drug Enforcement Administration, which oversees sales of potentially addictive, or ""controlled"" drugs. 'CAN'T ASSURE THE STERILITY'The FDA said on Monday it was looking into two other drugs made by NECC.The agency said it had received reports of a patient with possible meningitis who received an injection of a different steroid from the one found to have caused the deaths. It said on Tuesday that one transplant patient was infected with a fungus after receiving a drug used in open heart surgery made by NECC. The FDA originally said two such patients were infected.Another patient identified by the FDA received an injection of the steroid triamcinolone, also supplied by NECC.During a conference call on Tuesday with doctors on the meningitis outbreak, FDA official Janet Woodcock stressed that the two additional products had not been linked to confirmed infections. She asked doctors to contact patients injected since May to make sure they had no signs of infection.NECC said in a statement that it was reviewing the new information from the FDA.The FDA has been inspecting the NECC facilities. Woodcock said that based on the condition of the plant and other factors, ""we really can't assure the sterility of these products.""The legal threat to NECC also mounted as more victims of meningitis filed lawsuits, including two filed by Michigan residents this week.All but eight of the 23 states that received suspect medications from the Massachusetts specialist pharmacy have reported at least one case of fungal meningitis.Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. Fungal meningitis is not contagious.The outbreak has raised questions about how the pharmaceuticals industry operates. NECC engaged in a practice called drug compounding that is not regulated by the FDA, which generally oversees drug manufacturers.In compounding, pharmacies prepare specific doses of approved medications, based on guidance from a doctor, to meet an individual patient's need.A Reuters investigation found that NECC solicited bulk orders from physicians and failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required under state regulations, emails to a customer showed.State pharmacy regulators have said that NECC violated its license in Massachusetts by not requiring patient prescriptions before shipping products.The states reporting cases of meningitis are Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Florida.

She was talking to our mom. Mom had that sixth sense, that intuition only the best mothers have. She knew better than to let Stacey go that night, but my sister was determined. I guess it was about 10 p.m. or so -- time seemed so insignificant then. So, Stacey left. She left with the promise that she would be back later. I rolled over not long after and slept away my naiveté. It was about 4 a.m. I can see the green digital numbers illuminating my sleep-riddled eyes still. It was the doorbell that woke me up. It was the deafening scream of my mother that drew me to the living room. I stood in a pair of boxers immediately asking what was wrong. Two state troopers were there talking to my dad. My dad robotically interacted with them; the shield of shock had enveloped him. My mom sat on the couch, paralyzed with the news that was just told to her. She clutched a golden-framed picture of Stacey's senior portrait as if it were a substitute for Stacey herself. She too was living in a different reality. As if it were a reflex, she told me to return to my room. I, sensing the urgency of the moment, my heart beating uncontrollably, returned to my room. I sat down on my bed for what seemed like a matter of seconds before my mom came in my room to tell me Stacey was in a car accident. I, shedding away the last of my ignorance, responded by asking if she was okay. My mom never responded; tears poured down her face. I hugged her immediately; I did not need an answer. Stacey had lost control of her vehicle on a winding rural road in bad weather. After they finally retrieved her from the vehicle, she went into cardiac arrest three times in the ambulance on the way to hospital. The accident happened a little after 1 a.m. She was declared dead at 2:45 a.m. in the emergency room. I returned to the living room with my mother after the troopers left. My father joined us on the couch; together we sat there in disbelief. There is no way to understand this moment still. The three of us sat on the couch, in the well-lit living room, the darkness of the early morning hours peering through every window. My mom said over and over that she was not going to be able to get through this. She said what we all felt. The hospital called what seemed like moments later; my parents left to go see Stacey. They asked me if I wanted to go. I said no. There was no way I could bare seeing her lifeless body, wounds visible, on a cold impersonal gurney in the worthless emergency room. Instead, I spent that time alone in my room sitting on my bed, a single lamp on, trying to grasp, trying to understand. That was impossible. My life had changed forever; I would never see my sister again. It felt as if we were living in some alternate universe, as if the reality in which we were living was surreal. These things do not happen to people like us. Truthfully, they happen to everyone. Our fallibility is real. Even now as I write my thoughts it seems like I am writing about some fictional event; I cannot believe I went through this.We all dealt with our grief in those days a little differently. My father, a burly, average-height man with thinning hair, grieved deeply for Stacey. He and Stacey had a very special relationship, the admirable father-daughter type. My mother, a slight and shorter woman with shoulder-length hair, also was struck deeply with Stacey's passing. Stacey and my mom were very close, Stacey seemed to always confide in my mother, and I know my mother cherished this. For many months after, my mom would find herself uncontrollably crying at work, the reality of Stacey being gone becoming real and then fading away again. My parent's marriage stood strong throughout this ordeal.Seeing Stacey lying in a casket, her embalmed body at rest, ready for eternal respite, has returned to my memory often these past eight years. I remember bending over to kiss her lifeless forehead, the cold seeping into my lips. I remember her face, eyes forever shut off from the world, from us. About a week before she died, Stacey was visiting a couple of her best friends. They were at a diner having breakfast. Somehow, the conversation turned to an atypical topic for teenagers: death. Stacey casually mentioned that she wanted to have her face on her headstone when she died. She also said she wanted to be buried on a hill to be closer to God. This was her desire for eternity; this is my comfort for eternity. Stacey was buried on a sunny, green, and quiet hillside with her smiling face sandblasted onto a dark red granite headstone. There is no easy way to deal with death. There is no phrase which by its mere utterance will cure a bereaved person. I have learned this. This experience has allowed me to garner a motto for life: ""Every day you're alive, there's a reason to smile."" It is my hope that my personal narrative has helped you to stop, slow down, and appreciate what you have in life. Tragedies do not need to be an abrupt dark hole in our lives, but rather an invaluable lesson which can lead to a sunny day. You must not live for what was, but live for what can be.

There has been a tremendous shift for many people financially, and they need to rethink how they can begin the process of recapturing and restoring their dreams. With unprecedented foreclosures, massive downsizing and loss of lifestyle as many of us have known it, the paramount question is how we can shift paradigms and begin to recreate a compelling future for ourselves. So what is a paradigm? A paradigm is a pattern, mode, or specific way of thinking over a period of time. So what is the new paradigm for people who dare to create new ways of thinking and methodologies for being and living? Listed below are some new paradigms that you can implement into your life to create a new compelling future1. Focus on What You Have Left in Your LifeFocus is the key to success.The question is, are you going to focus on your losses or on what you have left? That is the decision that you will have to make. You can begin the shift by deliberately and intentionally focusing on the positive things that are still in your life. I am a certified Dream Coach, and I had one of my clients whose business supplied parts to automobile manufacturers for 20 years. During the crises in the auto industry, he found his business was directly and radically impacted. Each day he would go to his office and think about how much money he was losing and how many people he had to lay off. During a coaching session, we devised a plan for him to focus on what he had left and how he could devise a new plan for his life and business. Well, shortly thereafter, he expanded and shifted his thinking and contacted some overseas auto manufactures and began supplying them with auto parts. That is a prime example of focusing in on what you have left and devising plans to help you restore your dreams. His company now provides auto parts for manufactures globally. Another great way to create focus is to write down what your goals are in a simple, clear and concise manner. Only 3 percent of people have written goals, according to author Brian Tracey in his book Goals: How to Get Everything You Want -- Faster Than You Ever Thought Possible. My coaching clients have experienced that written goals keep you focused and intentional specifically on your dreams/goals. So I encourage you to begin to allow your vision/focus to pull you from the past and shift you into your magnificent future. 2. Shift Your Thoughts and WordsEverything in the universe begins with and revolves around two things: words and thoughts. Thoughts manifest into things. Therefore, if your life is going to change you must begin to think beyond current circumstances. So begin to deliberately and intentionally focus on and be clear about how you want your life to become. Secondly, begin to speak words that align your clarity of thoughts with your new paradigm. As a daily practice, begin to speak, affirm and align your words with your desires and dreams. 3. Reinvent YourselfAccording to Paul Zane Pilzer in his book The Next Millionaires, there were more millionaires created during the great depression than at any other time in history. So, with the right mindset, there is a great opportunity to create prosperity and new lives in the midst of difficult times. How does this process begin? It begins with an inventory, assessment and reexamination of what your talents/gifts/passions are. Secondly, begin brainstorming about how to take your unique talents and create innovative solutions, strategies and added value to the marketplace. To reinvent yourself can be a daunting task, but on the other hand, it can be an exciting exploration of untapped potential and talents, where you can add value in the form of services or goods. I had a client who had been downsized from a major corporation and felt ashamed, overwhelmed and lost. She decided that she was going to reinvent herself. Her former company paid for her to take personality inventory tests and she discovered what she always knew -- that she had great interpersonal skills and loved empowering others. At the time she felt that one way to reinvent herself was to turn her pain into her passion. She collaborated with a business partner and founded an employment agency which specialized in obtaining employment for displaced workers. That is a great example of someone who decided to reinvent themselves. 4. Create Your Dream TeamA new paradigm is the power of synergy. Learn how to reach out and ask for help. The definition of a synergistic relationship is two or more things or people functioning together to produce results not independently obtainable. During change and difficult times, many people isolate themselves and try to maneuver through difficult times alone, but the new paradigm is to create a dream team that helps you create and restore your dreams. Getting a mentor or a life coach is a great first step in creating your dream team. Another method of creating your dream team is to attend networking and meet up meetings, putting yourself in the position to develop empowering relationships. 5. Take ActionHenry David Thoreau stated: ""Go confidently in the direction of your dream."" So many people are waiting until all of their ""ducks are in a row,"" but you must begin movement now. You must align action with your desire. Begin taking small ""baby steps"" toward your dream. When you begin moving, you will begin building momentum. Momentum happens as you begin to experience success, then another one, then yet another one follows until you see great growth and progress.Begin utilizing the above-referenced steps to begin creating a new paradigm and exciting future for yourself. I have great anticipation for each of you restoring and creating your dream life.For more on emotional wellness, click here. "

I feel as if Romney and Obama have been squabbling in the back of my car for years now, blaming and yelling, poking each other and kicking my seat. But on November 6th it will finally stop. With a sigh of relief, I will trek to the polls and vote.  And that's when my mood will change. However beleaguered I feel now, I know that as I walk into the fluorscent light of the school gym that serves as my polling place, I will be hit with a surge of hope and gratitude. Voting is a privilege, a duty, a push forward into our collective future. It always feels good.  For me, pulling that lever (it's still done that way in my Brooklyn neighborhood) releases the knot of cynicism I've developed as an adult, in part because my mother took me with her to vote when I was a kid. My mom is a writer with a flair for dramatic storytelling. As we waited in line she would speak passionately about people in our country and around the world who had fought and died for the right to vote. She let me put my hands over hers as she pulled the lever, and sometimes she got teary as we yanked together. If this sounds corny or over-the-top, all I can tell you is that it imprinted on me in the best possible way. She made a faithful and optimistic voter of me, and I'm keeping up the tradition with my own daughters.   Today I edit Redbook, a magazine read by millions of American women, most of whom are moms. As we brainstormed for our November issue, we came up with the idea of a ""Take Your Kid to Vote"" campaign. First Lady Michelle Obama joined the cause, lending her voice to help spread the message. She agreed to put politics aside and spoke about the importance of including your kids in the voting process, no matter which candidate you support (go to redbookmag.com/kidsvote to see her essay and video and learn how you can get involved). This isn't about preaching a political philosophy, it's about passing down the habits of democracy. Vote for Romney or Obama -- or heck, for Rosanne Barr -- just make sure your children see you do it. Or, if circumstances prevent you from taking them to the polls, talk to them about the experience of casting your ballot.The turnout four years ago was unusually high -- but only 61% of eligible Americans voted. We have the chance to change that stat in a few weeks. And if we all treat voting as a teachable moment for our kids, we can shore up the democratic process fordecades to come."

With temperatures hovering in the 80s and fierce humidity forcing our clothes to stick to our sweaty bodies, the idea of wearing anything that even touched our skin was out of the question. The past few days have been much cooler, and our jeans are finally seeing the light of day again. But it won't be long before we are sick to death of denim. So why not try out corduroy pants this fall? They are the same shape and the ribbed fabric is just as comfortable and versatile as jeans, not to mention just as cost-effective. The key to wearing cords is to find the right shape for your silhouette. Then, wear them the same way you'd wear jeans (in fact, your favorite denim style is probably available in corduroy -- check out J.Brand's ""Love Story"" in cord). Buy a pair in a neutral hue like black, camel or grey or go for the color of the season, oxblood (that's burgundy to us normal folks). Check out our slideshow below of some of our favorite celebrities wearing corduroys, plus tips on which silhouette is right for your body shape. Want more?

The fungal outbreak is believed to have started at New England Compounding Center where a steroid injection shipment was contaminated with the fungus. (AP Photo/Pouya Dianat)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c69e626000035007f7811.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. meningitis outbreak that has so far killed 15 people and sickened more than 200 others is ""nowhere near the end,"" a top medical expert said Tuesday, a day after federal authorities warned more tainted drugs may be linked to the health crisis.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said on ""CBS This Morning"" that he expects a ""steady increase"" in the number of fungal meningitis infections over the coming weeks.The move on Monday by the Food and Drug Administration to widen its investigation into the cause of the fungal meningitis outbreak to other drugs made by a Massachusetts pharmacy, the New England Compounding Center (NECC), is ""ominous,"" Schaffner said.""We were concerned that there might be other medications that might be contaminated coming from that pharmacy,"" said Schaffner, who is past-president of National Foundation for Infectious Disease. ""The FDA has given us a heads up that that looks to be the case. We'll have to notify many more patients across the country that they may have been exposed to a fungal infection.""""I think we're still in the middle,"" Schaffner said, when asked about the outbreak's scope. ""We're nowhere near the end of this problem. And we will see more patients reporting in ill and we'll have to treat many more going forward.""The FDA said Monday it was looking into two other drugs made by NECC, based outside of Boston in Framingham, Massachusetts.The agency said it had received reports of a patient with possible meningitis who received an injection of a different steroid than the one found to have caused 15 deaths. It also said two transplant patients were infected with the rare fungus linked to the meningitis outbreak after receiving a heart drug also made by NECC.Also on Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nine more people were diagnosed with fungal meningitis linked to possibly tainted vials of the injected steroid methylprednisolone, bringing the number of cases to 212.The patient identified by the FDA as potentially having meningitis received an injection of the steroid triamcinolone, also supplied by NECC.The FDA said its investigation of that patient and the two who received the heart drug during surgery was ongoing, and it cautioned that any injectable drugs made by NECC, including those intended for use in eyes, are of ""significant concern.""The FDA has not confirmed that these three infections were caused by NECC products. NECC in a statement said it was reviewing the new information from the FDA.On Monday a Tennessee woman filed a lawsuit against NECC seeking $15 million in damages. SUSPECT LOTSAll but eight of the 23 states that received suspect medications from the Massachusetts specialist pharmacy have reported at least one case of fungal meningitis, a rare and deadly disease that has proven difficult to treat.The suspect lots of steroid were shipped to 76 facilities.A list of recalled NECC products on the FDA website ran 70 pages long. http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm322979.htmMeningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. Fungal meningitis is not contagious.The outbreak has raised questions about how the pharmaceuticals industry operates. NECC engaged in a practice called drug compounding that is not regulated by the FDA, which generally oversees drug makers.In compounding, pharmacies prepare specific doses of approved medications, based on guidance from a doctor, to meet an individual patient's need.A Reuters investigation found that NECC solicited bulk orders from physicians and failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required under state regulations, emails to a customer showed.State pharmacy regulators have said that NECC violated its license in Massachusetts by not requiring patient prescriptions before shipping products.The 15 states reporting cases of meningitis are Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Florida.

12,HOME & LIVING,5 Essential Tips for Single Homebuyers,"Michael Corbett, Contributor
Real estate and lifestyle expert; Author, 'Before You Buy!', '...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-essential-tips-single-homebuyers_us_5b9c662de4b03a1dcc7e5c79,More single homebuyers are entering the real estate market than ever before.,2012-10-16,"Man holding cardboards. Front view, whole body. Gray background",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c662d240000500094a8f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Home-buying trends have changed over the last decade, and in today's new market, more single homebuyers are entering the real estate market than ever before. Single women have now outpaced single men as a percentage of homebuyers. A whopping 21 percent of all new home purchases are credited to single women. But as far as must-haves, what do singles tend to look for? A single man or woman or newly married couple often wants to be closer to where the action is -- great restaurants, nightlife, theaters, movies, sporting events, shopping, etc. If you're looking at jumping into homeownership solo, here are my five top things to consider: Stay within your budget. Buying a home on your own is a fantastic move and great step toward your financial future. But make sure it's a home you can afford if there is a momentary -- or longer -- blip in your financial profile. If you lose a job, you have a health issue, or anything else happens that could affect your ability to cover your monthly mortgage and other costs, remember you don't have a spouse or significant other to fall back on for the additional monthly nut. So while you are on your own, don't overextend. Buy a home well within your means.Guess who's gonna mow the grass. Being the only person with a set of house keys also means being the only person responsible for maintenance. A leaky faucet and overgrown lawn won't take care of themselves. For those single homebuyers who find the idea of maintaining a yard a bit daunting, or who worry that climbing up ladders to clean out the gutters every rainy season is just too ""hands-on"" for them, condominiums and townhomes or even smaller homes in new communities require less exterior maintenance and might be a good option. In other words, don't buy a home you can't manage yourself.Look out for your safety and security. Remember that being a single homeowner doesn't allow for someone to be home the majority of the time. So you will need to consider safety and security issues. You want to be able to lock the door on your way out, and not have to think twice about it. So make sure you are in a low-crime neighborhood and the house or condo feels safe and secure. Consider resale value and longevity. Purchasing a home is a great long-term investment. However, there are many reasons single homebuyers may need to move, such as relocating for a job or a lifestyle change. Therefore, it's important to think about the resale value of prospective properties during the search. You want to be aware of homes and condos that have great general appeal and will be easy to resell if need be.Keep an eye on the future. You buy yourself a nice little home or condo now. But someday you might not be single and you'll add a significant other to your team and possibly even children. Though additional space may not be needed immediately, it's important to consider potential future plans for a home. Having a spare bedroom, if it's affordable, is a smart choice.  Single Homebuyer Bonus: You Just Got Hotter How fantastic that you, a single man or woman, are already planning to be a homeowner! Being financially smart and responsible may have seemed like strictly your parents' lifestyle a decade ago. It used to be sexy to be footloose and fancy-free, spending all your income on living the high life. Well, when the economy turned in 2007, that disposable-cash lifestyle became just that -- disposable. So don't think that if you are a single gal with your own home, men will find that intimidating. And don't think that if you are a single guy with your own home, women will think you are too set in your ways. Being a smart and financially responsible homeowner is the new sexy! That's right, you just became hotter."
