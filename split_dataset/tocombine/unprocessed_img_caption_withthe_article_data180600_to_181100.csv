On the world's biggest stage, amongst pop stars and athletes and royals, Kate Moss strode across the Olympic Stadium stage and totally owned it.The supermodel was joined by several of her top British peers, who comprised the brief yet high-impact fashion portion of Sunday night's closing ceremony. Naomi Campbell, Lily Cole, Lily Donaldson, David Gandy, Karen Elson, Jourdan Dunn, Georgia May Jagger and Stella Tennant -- the U.K.'s biggest stars in the modeling world -- were carried onto the stage on giant floats then did their best stomping model walks from the corners of the Union Jack into center stage to the tune of David Bowie's ""Fashion.""They showcased the best of British fashion design, wearing glittering gold threads by Alexander McQueen, Victoria Beckham, Paul Smith, Vivienne Westwood's Gold Label, Erdem, Jonathan Saunders, Burberry and Christopher Kane. They also inspired a bit of criticism by the less fashion-loving viewers taking in the show. ""Kate Moss! Who represents the Olympic ideals of not doing drugs, or smoking, and achieving lots. Work with me here,"" tweeted Charles Arthur of the Guardian. ""I suspect Kate Moss might fail her drugs test later. #closingceremony"" chimed in Piers Morgan. (Piers has never been a bit Kate fan.) Admittedly, we had our own HuffPost Style staff debate going as to whether Moss did look a tad drunk...Another critique of the show concerne the soundtrack: while the music choice of David Bowie certainly worked well for the fashion-centric segment, some of us wondered why the models didn't walk out to George Michael's ""Freedom,"" famous for its legendary model-filled music video and a centerpiece of the closing ceremony.But the much-anticipated fashion show, however brief, generally won widespread praise. Vogue UK's fashion director, Lucinda Chambers, avoided any wardrobe malfunctions with her flawless styling and the crowd of 80,000 cheered Kate and her pals with tons of applause.We contributed by squealing uncontrollably from the comfort of our couches.Check out the model extravaganza in the photos below!

(David Eulitt/Kansas City Star/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c21cf2000003100fd73de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I loved meeting my newborn sons. In their first hours of life, I held each of them, studying every detail of their unfamiliar faces. I tugged at their receiving blankets to reveal their tiny shoulders. I counted ten tiny fingers and smiled as their reflexive grip tightened around my finger, so enormous in comparison. I unswaddled them to place my hands on feet that had never before touched the ground. Those hours, and the days following, were filled with hope and wonder. Who will this boy be? A soldier? A scientist? A philanthropist? An Olympic athlete? I dreamed big for them. And I hoped all of their dreams would come true. It's been four years since I held my last newborn... and I can say with certainty that there is not an Olympic athlete in my bunch. For those parents who did give birth to Olympic athletes... thank you. This summer has been one of hope and wonder for my children as they've watched your children compete in the Olympic games. Debbie Phelps, did you pull down his blanket and peek at your baby boy's shoulders? Did you sense that they would eventually support the weight of 22 Olympic medals? Your child is a marvel. Thank you for recognizing that putting an active young boy in a pool will result in a tired young boy. Swimming proved a valuable strategy for dealing with Michael's ADHD. Did you dream when you first put him in the pool that he would eventually become the most recognized face in his sport? He has an intensity in the pool and a quiet confidence outside the pool. As the most decorated athlete in Olympic history, one could argue he has every right to be cocky. The fact that he isn't makes him even more endearing. I watched you watch him compete. As a mother, I identify with the intensity of watching him race, willing him to do his best. My kids watched your daughters watch their brother compete. They witnessed the pride your girls have in their little brother's commitment to his sport. These are lessons we teach in our home. Thank you for your family's example of what that support looks like... even once our kids reach adulthood. Lynn and Rick Raisman, when you held your daughter for the first time, did you smile when her tiny hand enveloped your finger? Did you hope that it would be the same hand that would catapult her to Olympic gold? Would you have dared to dream so big for this, your first born baby? Aly's sportsmanship sets her apart. We live in a world in which we've witnessed pro golfers throw their clubs in temper tantrums. We've seen a college basketball player choke his coach in a fit of rage. When Aly believed she hadn't medaled on the balance beam, she hugged her coach. She took a deep breath. She remained poised. She sought out Catalina Ponor, who'd seemingly edged her for the bronze, embraced her and congratulated her on a job well done. She was the picture of dignity. She's a teenager. Competing at an elite level. In front of the world. The pressure she experiences is unimaginable. She thought her score put her just out of medal's reach. Yet there it was... her sportsmanship. Her gesture is one I've played and replayed for my children. Boys, this is what sportsmanship looks like. My boys will never be Olympic athletes. They will never comprehend the pressure Aly feels. But they'll know what it feels like to try their very hardest and fall short of a goal. They'll know the sting of disappointment. Aly's example of sportsmanship in action at the highest level of competition is a lesson for my children. Pretty sweet that she wound up winning the bronze due to a scoring error.Sheila and Henke Pistorius, did you unswaddle your infant son and place your hands on his feet... feet that would only be his for a short time? Did you wonder who Oscar would be? 11 short months later, when he lost both legs below the knee, did you know then that your boy had the spirit of a champion? Did you sense, in a way that only a parent knows, that your child was destined to be a role model? That he would grow into a young man whose participation in the Olympics would embody courage? My children have watched your son in amazement. ""His blades are cool!"" Yep, his blades are cool. But his message is even cooler. No limits. No excuses. Endless possibilities. My husband and I choked back tears as we watched Kirani James, moments after winning the 400 meter semifinal, remove his bib in exchange for Oscar's. Your son has earned the respect of his fellow athletes. He's won the admiration of millions. Oscar is a true champion. An exceptional man. And a testament to the triumph of the human spirit. Every parent of an Olympic athlete has his and her own unique story. While the stories differ, the themes remain the same. Sacrifice, commitment, support. Sacrificing family dinners for practices. Spending nights, weekends, years in a gym, at a pool, on the track. For Natalie Hawkins, sacrifice meant spending two years away from her daughter, Gabby Douglas, so that Gabby could train with the coach she hoped would enable her to fulfill her Olympic dream. The commitment... time, financial, and emotional... to seeing your child's talent honed to make him one of the finest athletes to compete in his sport is beyond my imagination. The support you've given your children to empower them to continue performing with confidence, drive and excellence to reach the Olympic level of competition... I am in awe of it.When you held your babies, long before they were Olympians, before you knew they were athletes, did you wonder who they would be? Did you sense you were holding a future Olympic hero in your arms? Maybe, like I did, you simply dreamed big for them... and hoped all of their dreams would come true. To the parents of the Olympic athletes... thank you for sharing your children with us this summer. It's been an honor watching your children's dreams come true."
2,WEDDINGS,Lessons From A Virgin Bride,"Iris Krasnow, Contributor

(Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1ecf3c00004c0009a44e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like millions of other voyeuristic women, I, too, was sucked into Fifty Shades of Grey. The lure that kept me hooked throughout the trilogy on a San Diego beach this summer was definitely not the butt devices or riding crops, nor the quality of the writing.I was captured by the notion of a virginal awakening that turned into committed love and marriage. In Fifty Shades, Anastasia was a virgin at 21, a rare and diminishing breed. She was also a creature of fiction. Olympic track athlete Lolo Jones is the real thing. When the stunning Lolo, age 29, revealed during an HBO interview that she remains a virgin because it's ""a gift I want to give my husband"" there was a buzz among my own girl circle of midlife wives. We traded war stories of our tortured college romances that were physically euphoric and emotionally debilitating. We were the generation that came of age in the 1970s, an era that unleashed free love and random sex.I am a journalist, not a preacher, and I'm not about to tell everyone to hold off on sex until wedding vows are exchanged. It's important to know there is sexual chemistry in your relationship before you choose a person as a spouse. But I've come to believe as a longtime relationship writer that it's best to hold off on sex until it comes with love. Love and sex go great together!Experimenting with lots of bedfellows can feel good in the moment but there likely will be lasting repercussions. Older women who were products of the Sexual Revolution often tell me that having too many partners caused an inability to feel love, receive love or to sustain a relationship. Sex is not insignificant; we realize this more and more as we age. Sex is a big thing; it's the ultimate act of intimacy. There is a lesson here for younger women: Hooking up for one night with many people over many years can cause lots of confusion and pain.""Every time you have sex with someone it's like tearing off a little piece of your heart,"" says Texas photographer Ann Oettel, who was a virgin of 21 when she got married 13 years ago. Here is more from Ann, the daughter of a Lutheran minister and the mother of four children, ages 10 and under. She follows to the letter the word of the Bible, and while these ancient rules seem ludicrous to many singles there are some shrewd takeaways in Ann's views on sex and love and spiritual health:  I dated a lot of people and there were pressures to be physical, but I always had that ancient rule from the Bible ingrained in me. I see the damage it has done to my girlfriends who have had multiple sex partners. They go into sex, not understanding the bond that takes place when two people make love. It just affects so many different areas. It affects your body, your mind, your soul, your heart gets broken. As the Bible says, ""when the two become one flesh that is not meant to be broken."" And when you become one flesh with many people, of course you are going to have problems forming permanent unions.  Sex is a sacred expression of love. Why would you think of wasting it on just anybody? No wonder there are so many young people who feel so worthless and used up. No wonder there is so much depression among college students. When you become one flesh with a lot of people, it's like ripping off a little piece off your heart every time.  In college, my friends were sleeping with guys but it was not even an option for me. Did I kiss a lot of boys? Absolutely. My husband David did not even kiss a girl; he was very straight and narrow;, and very devoted to his Christian path. I honestly wished I had waited until I met David to kiss anyone, too. It doesn't do you any good to go around kissing a lot of people. Even that tears up your heart.  I remember during the days of Monica Lewinsky my college friends were saying things like maybe they would be tempted, too, to have sex with a handsome president. When I told them I would remain a virgin until marriage the look on their faces was aghast. That was a defining moment from me -- really significant. I confessed with my mouth what was true in my heart, and I didn't care what anyone thought of me.  And I stayed true to my words: I was that rare bride who had sex for the first time on her honeymoon. It was special because it was the first time, but frankly it wasn't great. Sex does get better with age - David knows me, I know him, and all we want to do is please each other. Our sex and our marriage has so much depth because we've been the only one for each other. We are truly making love and not just having sex.  To be a virgin at marriage is the way it should be. Like the Bible says, I do feel like we are one flesh, he is part of me and I am part of him and I can't even imagine being with anyone else. There is a confidence and comfort in sex for us. The thought of getting naked in front of another man is disgusting to me.  Sex is not meant to be a temporal thing; it's not meant to be a one-time thing. It's meant to be a coupling for life. You can't sleep with someone and not have a part of you attached to him. It is simply not possible. You might be pleasuring your body temporarily but you are leaving permanent scars on your soul.Right now I am watching track star Lolo Jones, strong and chaste, making some gracious comments on TV in the wake of her Olympic defeat. Eyes flashing, her smile riveting, she is talking about running and perseverance. I am imagining all the men who are watching along with me and thinking about sex and not sports. My wish for Lolo is that if she bears any permanent scars in her life it will be on her body from tough work-outs and not on her soul from ill-fated romance.Iris Krasnow's latest book ""The Secret Lives of Wives"" is being made into a Lifetime TV pilot."

The Chicago Tribune reported that Jackson has bipolar II depression, and is undergoing treatment at the Mayo Clinic. The Mayo Clinic released a statement about Jackson's diagnosis:Bipolar II disorder is a treatable condition that affects parts of the brain controlling emotion, thought and drive and is most likely caused by a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. Congressman Jackson underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2004. This type of surgery is increasingly common in the U.S. and can change how the body absorbs food, liquids, vitamins, nutrients and medications.Jackson left for an unexplained medical leave in June. His wife, Sandi, earlier said that Jackson was experiencing ""debilitating"" depression, the Associated Press reported, quashing rumors that he had departed because of alcohol or drug problems. In July, it was reported that Jackson was receiving treatment for a mood disorder, but there was no elaboration on exactly what kind of disorder it was. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive disorder, includes symptoms of extreme mood swings where you may feel depressed one moment, and then extremely manic the next. These mood shifts can occur on a daily basis, or only several times a year, according to the Mayo Clinic. Bipolar disorder is considered a mood disorder, along with depression, dysthymia (which is having a low, depressed mood for a year or more), substance-induced mood disorder (depression as a result of a substance like drugs or toxins) and mood disorder from a general medical condition (where a medical condition is the cause of the depressive symptoms), according to Ohio State University.Mood disorders occur when brain chemicals are imbalanced, and can be contributed to by major negative life events, Ohio State University reported.Bipolar disorder, in particular, is comprised of three different subtypes. The most severe kind is bipolar I disorder, which is when episodes of mania can reach dangerous levels, and the mood swings are evident enough to severely interfere with daily life, according to the Mayo Clinic. The least severe kind is cyclothymic disorder, which is when the depression and mania are not as severe. Bipolar II disorder -- which is what Jackson has been diagnosed with -- on the other hand, usually involves less severe mania and longer periods of depression. Daily functioning may be affected, but not to the extent of bipolar I disorder, the Mayo Clinic reported. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is not known, but researchers suspect genetics play a part, according to the National Institutes of Health. Medications are usually used to treat bipolar disorder, though psychotherapy and some other kinds of treatments -- like electroconvulsive therapy -- may also be employed, according to the Mayo Clinic. Hospitalization is sometimes required.Last year, actress Catherine Zeta Jones made headlines after she was treated for bipolar II disorder after helping her husband, Michael Douglas, through his throat cancer battle, People magazine reported.
