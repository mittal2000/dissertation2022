The Daily Show took a fairly serious look at the politics of gun control, while The Colbert Report focused on the futility of President Obama and Mitt Romney pausing their negative campaigns for a few days. Other topics that appeared this week on the late night shows included Mitt Romney's trip to London, the continued obsession with Obama's ""you didn't build that"" remark and Chick-fil-A.There were a few Olympic previews, but we'll have to wait until next week to see how the late night shows react to the insanity that was Friday night's Opening Ceremony. Below are my favorite clips of the week. What were yours?More comedy videos at: GotchaMediaBlog.com"
