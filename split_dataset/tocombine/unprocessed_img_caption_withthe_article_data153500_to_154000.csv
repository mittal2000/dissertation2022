Thanks.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2dc22000003000fddc66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I sit at the wooden desk in my bedroom, tapping my right foot as I peel open my notebook to a clean page. I cradle my favorite pen in my fingertips and lean forward, poised, ready to jot down the thoughts that have been building up like plaque in my brain. I've always been a believer in setting goals. In the past, though, I've been able to achieve my goals just by writing them down and didn't have to remind myself of them on a regular basis. However, as my goals grew more complex, they pushed me to make bigger leaps out of my comfort zone. The completion of each goal required more patience and dedication; scribbling a few New Year's resolutions was no longer sufficient. I finally decided to make a change to my goal-setting strategy. Rather than setting goals once a year, I would write down my goals as often as once a month and visualize myself achieving them. Ever since I began these new practices, I've been thrilled with the results. In sharing these strategies, I hope they will help you advance with confidence in the direction of your goals.Write. Begin by writing down at least five significant goals once a month. Perhaps you prefer to write your goals in a private diary or maybe you'd like to hang sticky notes on the mirror in your bedroom; wherever you decide to write them, just make sure they're easily accessible to you. As you write, push yourself to elaborate on each goal: Be specific about what it is you're striving for and how you envision yourself getting there. For example, if your goal is to get better at staying in touch with friends and family, narrow down the specific people you want to talk to more, the best way to keep in touch with each person and how accomplishing this goal might improve your well-being as well as the well-being of others. Writing is transformative. By writing down your goals, you're legitimizing them and making them more tangible. But if you continue to let your ideas spin around in your head, they will remain abstract, muddied by your other thoughts and therefore easily ignored. Transcribing your ideas on paper is like a dissection of your brain -- as you extract your thoughts, you're forced to understand them in their purest form. Ultimately, writing down your goals will help you internalize their meaning and come to terms with next steps and execution.Visualize. After writing down your goals, you may already start to feel a sense of relief -- you finally pinned down your ideas and you're aware of the work that needs to be done. As often as possible (aim for once a week), re-read your list of goals. Find a comfortable chair, bed or couch and close your eyes. Treat this time like a short meditation session as you focus on breathing deeply, slowing down your heart rate and clearing your head. Then begin imagining yourself doing, being or seeing whatever it is you have written down. Observe yourself in the act of achieving these goals and note your self-confidence. Pay attention to how the realization of your goals makes you feel and how others are impacted. By practicing visualization and revisiting your goals often, they will stay fresh in your mind and you'll be more likely to achieve them.Do. Now it's time for you to get out there and put yourself to the test (yes, this is the hard part). If your goals are big enough, though, it's not feasible to achieve them in a few days. Continue to remind yourself that the fulfillment of your goals will take time, energy and relentless positivity. If you take these practices seriously, I'd be shocked if you didn't see any progress. Write, visualize, do, repeat (and don't forget to smile along the way).For more by Jennifer Langione, click here.For more on success and motivation, click here."

But for mothers of school-aged children, balance is more like a three-legged stool than it is a two-sided scale. And school is the third leg of that stool.",2013-05-29,Mother helping son and daughter (6-8) get into mini van,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2cef2200005600d9861d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you're in town tomorrow, swing by the elementary school musical theater performance and wave to my daughter on stage. You'll know who she is -- the one in the gray pants; everyone else will be wearing black.My daughter doesn't own black pants, although I would have been happy to buy her a pair. I could have picked them up when I walked by the Gap, twice, yesterday. Or I'm sure I could have found a pair for her at any number of stores in New York City, where I spent the day on business. But you see I didn't know she needed black pants until I was seated on the 7:00 p.m. Acela train headed home and I received a text from a friend, another mother. It read, ""FYI, musical theatre show is tomorrow at 3:30. Clearly I missed the notice."" Except there hadn't been a notice before the note that came home -- the day before the event -- the notice that also said the student performers needed to wear black pants. And by the time I got home, it would be 10:30 -- much too late to go shopping. I sent a text to my husband from the train asking him if he knew about the black pant request and what he was doing about it. He responded, ""I have the situation handled."" But I wanted more details. He told me my daughter would wear her leggings. I replied, ""I think they are gray."" He ignored my text. So I called him. And again he told me, ""I'm handling this."" I checked the pants when I got home and sure enough they were gray. Gray is not black. But I remained calm. A few years ago, I wouldn't have been so composed. A few years ago, the school principal called home after dinner the night before Flag Day, and invited the kids to ride on the school's float in the town parade the next day. Flag Day is kind of a big deal where we live. ""If your kids are interested,"" she said, ""have them at the start of the parade route by 5:30 p.m. wearing red, white and blue."" They were definitely interested.But what were they going to wear and how was I supposed to plan their outfits when I had a proposal to finish for work the next day? ""Don't worry,"" my husband said. ""Get your work done and I'll find clothes for them."" I had a bad feeling, but I took him up on the offer.The next morning, as I was rushing around getting ready for work, I asked to see the patriotic attire he picked out. Oh no! Oh no! I lost it when I saw what my husband had chosen. I imagined people talking about ""those poor kids"" the ones who never had the right attire. ""Is their mother colorblind?"" people would ask. ""No. She works."" ""Blueberry is not one of the colors on the American flag!"" I cried. ""The blue on the flag is navy! And these pants? They are maroon! Maroon is not red!"" My husband made a few adjustments. Still I wasn't satisfied but there was nothing I could do. I had to get to work, and I wouldn't be home before the kids left for the parade. I had spiked my blood pressure, alienated my husband, and worst of all, had made my kids feel bad about their now pink, teal and ecru outfits. I sobbed all the way to work. That night, after fighting rush hour traffic to get to the parade on time, I saw my smiling kids go by on the float in their outfits that more closely resembled a transgender pride flag than an American flag. And I thought, ""Wow they look so happy. And hey, most of the kids aren't in red, white and blue anyway. And besides, I support LGBT rights. It's all good."" And it was.So even though I couldn't resist telling my husband last night that gray is not black, (it's not even the new black), I wasn't going to lose sleep over my daughter's costume. I know that when the curtain rises, she'll be singing and smiling no matter what she's wearing. What's more concerning for me is that I didn't have enough notice to rearrange my work schedule so I could attend the performance.Work life balance for working mothers is often thought of as equilibrium between career and family. But for mothers of school-aged children, balance is more like a three-legged stool than it is a two-sided scale. And school is the third leg of that stool. No working parent expects to see every performance or chaperone every field trip, but we do want enough time to make choices about what things we will or will not attend. Especially at this time of year, striking a balance can be incredibly challenging due to a very busy school calendar. May and June are jammed with standardized tests, warm-weather field trips, end-of-year concerts, carnivals and recitals. So when it comes to special requests -- black pants for theatre, red shirts for a group photo, hair nets for lunch lady appreciation day (really), we do our best. And if we can't honor the request, so be it. I'm learning that staying balanced means focusing on what truly matters. In order to maintain my schedule, my sanity and my relationship with my spouse, it helps to be crystal clear about what's important. My child's happiness is important; what she wears is not. My husband's support is important; his doing things the way I might do them is not. Working with the school system to improve communication is important; I'll put my energy there. I'm confident that busy, working parents like me can partner with school administrators to make positive changes that benefit everyone.Next week, at the all-town chorus concert, the singers will be wearing white shirts and black pants -- except for my son. He'll be wearing navy. My husband informed me he was not going to buy a new pair of pants that my son would only wear once when he had a perfectly nice pair of navy pants already. And even though I thought to myself, ""Navy is not black,"" I don't have time to shop between business trips. So I said to my husband, ""That's fine dear."" And so, if you happen to catch the performance next week, look for my son. He'll be ""that"" kid. No, not the one with the colorblind mother. The one whose mother found a little balance."

Now that we're older and a bit more rebellious, we'd rather bask in the sun's glow than sport a wide-brimmed hat. But this blasé attitude can result in dry and frizzy locks. To help us all protect and repair our strands from the sun, stylist and salon owner Mario Russo offers his best summer haircare tips below. Get wet ... with your hair  Dakota Fanning and Ashley Olsen's wet hair looks are great when it comes to summer haircare. According to Russo, applying deep conditioner to wet hair and thoroughly combing it through before heading out to the surf or sun offers optimal protection. The heat from the summer sun will open the hair cuticle and help the conditioner to penetrate better. Throw on a mask To replenish moisture to sun-damaged strands, use deep conditioning masks at least once a week -- leave the product on as long as possible or sit with it under a dryer or in a steam room. Oils are also essential to smooth and repair locks and can be applied to wet or dry hair.Cut loose split ends Make sure to frequently trim your ends to prevent split ends from traveling up the hair shaft and damaging hair. Russo recommends scheduling a trim every four to six weeks to maintain both your cut and the health of your hair. Step away from the heat styling tools During the warm-weather months, it's best to limit your use of the blow dryer and flat iron. When the air is moist, it can take longer to style hair which can result in further drying and damage. If you absolutely must use styling tools, liberally apply a heat protectant beforehand. You can also opt for frizz-free hairstyles like the topknot or messy chignon that don't require heat and can easily transition into soft waves.How do you protect and repair your hair from sun damage?Sun protection for your hair, feet and everything in between:Want more HuffPost Style beauty content?

When planning this year's summer escape, consider touring the country taste testing some of these mouth-watering summer bites.Here's just a smorgasbord sampling to whet the appetite:  Clambakes, Lobster Rolls & Cape Cod: If you're a seafood lover and you haven't been to the Cape for an authentic clambake or lobster roll, you're missing out. From road side stands to a clambake pit on the beach, the Cape is dotted with local favorites for these seafood staples. Plus in New England it's never too hot for a cup of hot New England clam chowdah.Hot Dogs & Chicago: There's no shortage of nationally-renowned hot dog stands in Chicago. From the foodie to the local, people flock to these establishments for arguably the best hot dog in the nation, bearing the city's name -- that traditional Chicago dog on a poppy seed bun topped with yellow mustard, white onions, sweet pickle relish, tomato, peppers, dill pickle and a dash of celery salt.Salt Water Taffy & The Jersey Shore: As a New Jersey native, there's one smell that is forever ingrained in my mind from childhood -- the aromatic blend of the salty ocean, the hot wooden boards of the boardwalk and the sweet fragrance of salt water taffy. Thankfully this pulled, sticky sweet created as an Atlantic City gimmick took off as a local favorite, with flavors today spanning from peppermint to cotton candy to peaches and cream.  Barbecue & Texas: A barbecue in Texas isn't just a summer tradition, it's a way of life. And you can literally travel the enormous state by finger-licking different styles of barbeque based on each region. East for its slow-cooked beef marinated in sweet sauce; Central for its meat rubbed with spices; West for meat cooked directly over mesquite wood, with a bitter flavor; and South for its meat slathered in thick, molasses-based sauces.Shave Ice & Hawaii: It's shave ice not shaved ice to the locals, but regardless, it's a summer treat that started in Japan, made its way to the island state and spread through the U.S. While I've made some interesting, if not suspect, flavor creations with my childhood Snoopy Snow Cone Maker, locals have the benefit of amazing natural ingredients like guava, pineapple, coconut cream, passion fruit, kiwi, mango and lychee. One of the best places to try some shave ice is Haleiwa on the island of Oahu, where this icy favorite is a signature dessert.Fish Tacos & San Diego: This local delicacy has literally hundreds of establishments dedicated to it throughout the San Diego-area, offering unique takes on a beach-bum favorite. Fried or grilled? fast-food or upscale restaurant? You can join the area's great debate by trying them all and deciding for yourself. And the best part is most fish taco eateries are a stone's throw, if not on the water, offering a taco with a view.For more great summer eating treats, check out our Local Deals, with offers from top-rated restaurants around the U.S.  --Chris Vassil is a Travelzoo Deal Expert based in Toronto, Canada.

Preparing for grilling season isn't like getting ready for a rapture that never happens--there is real life flavor at stake. We have less than a week. Let's go! Here's an easy three-point checklist from our Test Kitchen to make sure your first summer lunch is well done (meaning medium rare).   1) Clean the Grill: Most likely the grate has a bunch of last year's gunk clinging to it. Get rid of it! You can do a little oven cleaner action on the grate: Remove it from the grill, spray it, scrub it down really good, and give it a thorough rinse. Light a fire under it as a final step--just let the fire burn out, and you're ready to go. If you have a gas grill, clean out the holes in gas tubes (or even replace the tubes), as many get clogged, leading to uneven cooking. You can do this with a wire skewer or a strong toothpick.

Our ideal grilling pantry is equipped with kosher salt, Maldon sea salt, whole spices, dried chiles, some brown sugar, and a spice grinder. Some Asian sauces--like soy, oyster, and chili garlic--are great too. Don't forget fresh lemons and limes, olive oil, and tons of fresh herbs. 3) Pick Out Some Recipes: Luckily, we've got over a hundred--like Cheddar Burgers With Balsamic Onions And Chipotle Ketchup, Yogurt-Marinated Chicken Kebabs with Aleppo Pepper (pictured), and Grilled Corn on the Cob with Chile and Lime.More from Bon Appétit: 25 Ways to Use Sriracha 7 Most Common French Toast Mistakes The Best-Ever Homemade Fries 10 Snacks You Thought Were Healthy But Really Aren't "
