Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, is gaining steam against top Republican rivals, according to a national Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. In a hypothetical matchup against the current GOP front-runner, business mogul Donald Trump, Sanders takes 49 percent of the vote to Trump's 41 percent. Against Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sanders leads 44 percent to 43 percent. He also beats Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) by 10 percentage points and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson by 6 points. Fifty-nine percent of voters also say Sanders is honest and trustworthy -- placing him well above former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, and above all top Republican candidates tested in the poll. Clinton, for her part, has also gained some ground in the race, spelling good news for Democrats overall. She is now performing better against top Republican rivals compared to one month ago, when she was just slightly ahead of Trump and losing against all other Republicans in a Quinnipiac poll. In this latest poll, Sanders performs equally well as Clinton against Republicans or better. In the Democratic primary, Clinton continues to lead with 60 percent of the vote to Sanders' 30 percent. Her lead has widened by 12 points since an October Quinnipiac poll.In the Republican primary contest, the poll finds that Trump has gained while Carson, who was in second place one month ago, has fallen to third place. Rubio has jumped to second place with 17 percent of the vote to Trump's 27 percent. Cruz is now tied in third place with Carson at 16 percent. With 11 months left until the general election, polls are still highly subject to change. For now, they are only able to capture a snapshot of the current state of the race, rather than serve as a predictor of the eventual outcome.Quinnipiac surveyed 1,453 general election voters with a subsample of 672 Republican voters and 573 Democratic voters. The national poll was conducted Nov. 23 through Nov. 30 using live interview calls to landlines and cell phones. The overall margin of error for the poll is 2.6 percent. Also on HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,Supreme Court Blocks Native Hawaiians' Attempt To Form Own Government,Chloe Fox,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-hawaii-election_us_565f6849e4b079b2818d1767,Opponents said the election was racially exclusive.,2015-12-02,Thousands of Native Hawaiians and other Hawaii residents marched in August raise awareness for Native Hawaiian issues.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565f74d91b0000150129f0e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court has indefinitely stopped Native Hawaiians from moving forward with a unique and controversial election that they are hoping to use to form their own government.The high court on Wednesday extended a temporary stay issued by Justice Anthony Kennedy on Friday, granting an injunction requested by a group of Native Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians challenging the election. The election would select delegates for a constitutional convention, and is seen as a critical first step toward self-governance for Native Hawaiians -- the only indigenous community in the country without an independent political structure. A constitutional convention scheduled for early next year would then recommend a form of self-government, deciding what -- if any -- relationship that government should have with the United States.But opponents of the election say that it's racially exclusive, arguing that Hawaii residents who don't have Native Hawaiian ancestry are being excluded from a vote that will have a big impact on their state.In October, a district court ruled the election was legal because it was being conducted by the nonprofit Nai Aupuni as a private poll, not by the state, but opponents appealed the ruling. As evidence of the state's involvement, critics have pointed out that the election was made possible by $2.6 million from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a public agency tasked with improving the well-being of Native Hawaiians.The Supreme Court order blocks the counting of votes until at least the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issues its ruling on the election.The court's four liberal justices said they would have allowed votes to be counted, pending the appeal.Voting was scheduled to end Monday, but after Kennedy's ruling, Nai Aupuni extended voting until Dec. 21. The group said voters may not have cast ballots over concerns and questions about Kennedy's order.Wednesday's ruling was issued soon after the group challenging the election alerted the Supreme Court about the extension.""The U.S. Supreme Court decision to uphold Justice Kennedy's injunction halting a Hawaii state-sponsored, race-based election is a victory for the Constitution and the Aloha Spirit,"" Kelii Akina, one of the Native Hawaiian plaintiffs, said in a statement.In a statement later Wednesday, Nai Aupuni said they ""believe the process aligns with the U.S. Constitution and that the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately will let the election process proceed.""""We will ask the appeals court to expedite the hearing so that votes can be counted and the constitutional convention, or ‘Aha, can proceed this summer,"" the statement said.  This story has been updated to include comment from Nai Aupuni.The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

3,TECH,"If Uber Kills Cabs, Cities Must Ensure Accessible Vehicles Live",Alexander Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-cab-companies-cities_us_5654bce6e4b0879a5b0cbe88,"""This is more urgent than people realize.""",2015-12-01,"Service representative Debbie Pixler watches as Rod Hoffman works the ramp in the MV-1 during a showcase of the new MV-1 line of accessible vans at Medved on Thursday, March 8, 2012. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5654c81e1b0000470029e862.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Accessibility advocates have argued for years that on-demand car companies don't serve people with disabilities well. Now there's a figure to back them up: According to a recent report, the number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles for hire in San Francisco fell significantly in the past few years -- all while services like Uber and Lyft were rapidly expanding in the area.""This is more urgent than people realize,"" Carol Tyson, policy director for the United Spinal Association, told The Huffington Post.Tyson, the author of a MobilityLab.org post about this issue, sits on the Disability Advisory Committee for the District of Columbia Taxicab Commission. That group's report, published in October, said that San Francisco's wheelchair-friendly cabs dropped from 100 in 2013 to just 64 in 2015.While Uber has introduced limited offerings for passengers with disabilities in some cities, it and other on-demand car services don't currently operate under the same accessibility rules that cab companies do. There's no mandate for Uber, Lyft or similar startups to include wheelchair-ready cars in their fleets. What's more, the potential for on-demand startups to drive taxi companies into bankruptcy is no longer theoretical: More than 1 million Uber drivers now handle 2 million rides every day around the world. If what's happened in San Francisco is replicated in other cities, more than 3.3 million American adults who use a wheelchair will be affected. If that's the outcome, on-demand services like Uber will have made life harder for these people. Taxi companies are considered a means of public accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and therefore must include accessible cars in their fleets. Uber acknowledged to HuffPost that it is subject to and complies with the law as a technology company, ensuring that its apps --but not its vehicles -- are accessible to Americans with disabilities. That position may not sit well in some cities.""Private sedan operators are a part of the District’s transportation ecosystem and, as such, must be accessible to customers with a disability,"" Neville Waters, a spokesperson at the Taxicab Commission of the District of Columbia, told HuffPost. Uber hasn't been sitting idle on this issue. As Wired reported in August, Uber now operates UberAssist pilots in seven U.S. cities and five Australian cities, offering cars designed to better meet the needs of senior citizens and people with disabilities. Unlike the van pictured above, however, UberAssist vehicles don't have ramps: They accommodate only folding wheelchairs, walkers and scooters.Uber also provides its drivers with accessibility materials, and a section of its Code of Conduct prohibits discrimination when serving riders with disabilities. Lyft did not reply to repeated requests for comment on this or other issues.Neither ride-hailing company provided data on the total number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles available through their apps or daily rides requested in these particular cars. (In the past, Uber has lobbied against being forced to disclose ridership data to regulators.)""Uber is committed to providing increased transportation options for everyone through the use of Uber's app,"" a company spokesperson said. ""Our cross-functional accessibility team is dedicated to leveraging technology to increase the mobility, efficiency and freedom of all riders and drivers with accessibility needs.""What that actually means in practice will be tested in the year ahead. While the D.C. advisory committee's research found that demand for taxi medallions for wheelchair-accessible cars had plummeted in New York City, the Big Apple's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) expects cabs to provide accessibility options well into the future.""The NYC TLC and mayoral administration have committed to a 50 percent wheelchair-accessible taxi fleet by the year 2020, accomplished through the attrition and scheduled replacement of retiring cabs,"" Allan J. Fromberg, the TLC's deputy commissioner for public affairs, told HuffPost. The city plans to offer a $14,000 subsidy to individuals for purchasing a wheelchair-accessible version of NYC's new standard taxi model.Other cities are using federal funds, tax credits, incentives and governmental mandates to support and increase the number of public wheelchair-accessible vehicles on the roads.For instance, although D.C. has struggled to meet its deadlines, as of Nov. 6, the city has awarded 90 grants to purchase new wheelchair-accessible cabs, retrofit existing vehicles or offset rental costs. Now that Uber is expressing interest in city paratransit networks, the company's policies are receiving more scrutiny from regulators.""My real concern as a disability advocate is that this is a company that is refusing to admit it needs to comply with the ADA, either as a transportation company or public accommodation,"" Tyson told HuffPost, ""and yet this is a company that wants to provide service to disabled Americans."" Uber, Airbnb and other pillars of the ""on-demand economy"" like to argue that self-regulation will be enough to protect consumers on these platforms, but it's not clear that it's working here. The trouble is that when cities have tried to regulate these startups, the companies now mobilize the public using their own platforms to defeat laws they dislike, in addition to lobbying for favorable rules in statehouses across the United States.If we allow this public debate to be framed as a binary choice between protecting incumbent cab companies against nimble innovators, the public will lose. On-demand startups can reduce discrimination or embed it more deeply, depending on how they're made and regulated. The companies that run them can also be key partners for cities to pool demand, reduce congestion and, one day, maybe even remove the need for car ownership altogether. Governments of the people, for the people should work with these new engines of the economy to achieve desired societal outcomes. If cities don't shift their response to this issue into overdrive, our neighbors may be left waiting at the curb."
4,POLITICS,The Supreme Court Is 100 Percent Unanimous. That Won't Last Long.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-unanimous-obb-v-sachs_us_565ddef5e4b08e945fecbcfc,"But for one brief shining moment, the justices all agreed on something.",2015-12-01,Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a unanimous court -- not the usual outcome.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565362bc1b0000270029e6ba.jpeg?cache=bzbKrvvjMw&ops=crop_30_296_5085_2834%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Since October, the Supreme Court has been 100 percent unanimous in its rulings.That's probably because the court just issued its first decision in an argued case this term -- a 9-0 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts.The case, OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, was a quirky one involving the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, a law that largely protects foreign countries and their agencies from being dragged into a U.S. federal court. In an 11-page ruling issued Tuesday, Roberts wrote that OBB, a railway company owned by the Republic of Austria, is shielded from a federal lawsuit brought by a California woman who was horribly injured during a trip abroad.""OBB has sovereign immunity under the Act, and accordingly the courts of the United States lack jurisdiction over the suit,"" he wrote.The decision marks a big loss for Carol Sachs, who was hoping to convince the Supreme Court that an exception under the law for ""commercial activity carried on in the United States"" would allow her to sue the Austrian railway here. Sachs latched on to that exception because she had purchased her Eurail ticket from a Massachusetts-based agent that billed itself as ""the largest single train ticket and rail pass outlet in the U.S.,"" but disclaimed all responsibility in the event of any accidents during the trip.Visiting Austria in 2007, Sachs slipped while attempting to board an OBB train. She fell from the platform onto the tracks, and in Roberts' retelling of the facts, ""OBB's moving train crushed her legs, both of which had to be amputated above the knee.""The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit agreed with Sachs that the exception to immunity applied to her case and thus the railroad could be sued in federal court. But the Supreme Court reversed that ruling, reasoning that Sachs' purchase of a Eurail pass in the U.S. from a third party was not enough of a connection to OBB, under a prior precedent, to allow her to bring her case in the U.S.""All of her claims turn on the same tragic episode in Austria, allegedly caused by wrongful conduct and dangerous conditions in Austria, which led to injuries suffered in Austria,"" Roberts wrote.The chief justice evoked two oft-quoted predecessors, Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Felix Frankfurter, to explain the court's decision.""A century ago, in a letter to then-Professor Frankfurter, Justice Holmes wrote that the essentials of a personal injury narrative will be found at the point of contact -- 'the place where the boy got his fingers pinched,'"" Roberts wrote.In other words, Sachs may be able to find relief in the courts of Austria, just not in the U.S.The Supreme Court's current unanimity will certainly be short-lived. Between now and June, the justices will be deciding high-profile disputes on abortion, affirmative action at public universities, voting rights, contraception, public-sector union fees and maybe even immigration -- all before the 2016 presidential election."

The Texas senator called Dear a ""transgendered leftist activist"" at a campaign stop in Iowa on Sunday.“The media promptly wants to blame him on the pro-life moment when at this point there is very little evidence to suggest that,"" he said.Cruz has adamantly opposed Planned Parenthood throughout his campaign. In September, he said the reproductive rights organization was a ""criminal enterprise"" and a post on his website has called for the agency to be investigated and defunded.The final moments of his interview with Hewitt were spent on hits against Democrats and President Barack Obama's ongoing plan to dramatically lower U.S. prison populations.

Bush urged Jeb Bush to just say what he would have done in Iraq without concern for his brother's feelings. ""Stop it with this shit,"" the former president reportedly said. ""Say whatever you have to say.""Coppins writes in The Wilderness that ""the private phone call between Dubya and Jeb never made the news, but word traveled through the Bush family's network of friends and allies, and those who knew the brothers best weren't surprised.""Though the private call didn't make the news, several members of the news media, including Coppins, had heard about it more than four months ago. On June 11, Jeb Bush mentioned the call with his brother during an off-the-record session with reporters at a beer garden in Warsaw, Poland, according to sources present.""I was at that happy hour in Warsaw, but I've honored the off-the-record nature of the event and will continue to do so,"" Coppins said in a statement. ""My book is based on more than 300 interviews, and the quote you're asking about came from that reporting process.""A spokesman for presidential candidate Bush declined to comment. In June, the group of journalists -- from major TV networks and outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and Politico -- squeezed around a table for drinks on the second night of a three-day European swing that Bush took before officially announcing his candidacy. Such off-the-record gatherings are occasionally held so that candidates can speak more freely without fear that every utterance will be immediately tweeted. Given the off-the-record rules, journalists didn't report the Bush brothers' anecdote -- which has led to some private grumbling that Coppins, who was also at the Warsaw gathering, included the anecdote in his book. Coppins maintains that he didn't break the ground rules, but was able to tell the story based on his broad reporting for the new book. The brothers' conversation appeared to have an impact. For several days in May, Jeb Bush had struggled with addressing the Iraq War question and his brother's legacy. But after the conversation, he told an Arizona audience that he would not have invaded Iraq knowing what is now known about the absence of weapons of mass destruction.Also on HuffPost:"

Sources said the new measure, which would have extended the health benefits and added five years to the Victim Compensation Fund, would have cost about $7 billion. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) had proposed paying for most of it with the proceeds from a forfeiture agreement with BNP Paribas SA. Top Senate Democrats accused McConnell of using the 9/11 bill as leverage for future negotiations. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) described the strategy as ""give us something, we'll give you help for the 9/11 rescue workers"" in remarks to reporters.Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) ""ticked off every box of every potential opponent -- Democrat, Republican, House and Senate,"" Durbin said. ""It all came down to one box at the bottom: Mitch McConnell. He stopped it.""McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said in an email that Durbin's contention was ""just not accurate.""""The bill is still being developed, both the duration and payfors are undecided,"" he said. ""Once that’s done, it can move forward.""Schumer said in a statement that it was ""just plain wrong to play politics with the healthcare of these 9/11 heroes.""""These brave men and women rushed headfirst into the Towers to save the lives of others, which is why this bill has broad bipartisan support, a majority of both the House and the Senate, and needs to be passed right away,"" he said.It's unclear when the 9/11 proposal will actually get a vote. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said at a press conference that he was ""disappointed"" it wasn't included in the highway bill and that he wasn't sure what Republicans were planning. ""I don't know what their 9/11 idea of the day is -- I should say the hour,"" Reid said.If the measure doesn't get attached to the highway bill, another possible route is attaching it to the must-pass government funding bill that is due for a vote next week.A separate standalone measure that would make the health care and compensation for first responders permanent has more than enough support to pass on its own, with a supermajority of senators and more than 250 members of the House backing it. But before it can pass, it needs to be brought up for a vote.Update: 9:30 p.m.Goodlatte said in a statement Tuesday night that he was still optimistic a 9/11 bill would pass, including the part in his committee's jurisdiction, the compensation fund.""I am pleased to announce that we are close to a final deal with the sponsors of the original Zadroga Act in order to provide a fully-funded five-year extension of the 9/11 VCF,"" Goodlatte said. ""Most of the major issues have been resolved, but we are continuing our talks with all stakeholders in order to have a final bill completed by the end of the year."""

The number of men participating in what the organization calls the #FreedomGiving hunger strikes is now at more than 130, DRUM executive director Fahd Ahmed told The Huffington Post.The group, which is working with the detainees, alleges that detention center staff members have retaliated against hunger strikers, including using verbal threats and placing eight protesters in solitary confinement for multiple days. All of the men are seeking asylum in the U.S., and have been in detention for at least six months -- and sometimes as long as two years, Ahmed said. He added that most of the hunger strikers are South Asian.Rumon Ahmed, a Bangladeshi man participating in the hunger strikes, told advocates in a recording DRUM provided to the HuffPost that he and the others ""came to this country to save our lives."" He said medical workers mistreated him during the hunger strike by putting in a catheter and taking his blood without his consent. ""If we are returned, we will be killed,"" he said, as translated by HuffPost. ""We came here to save our lives instead it has been complete self-destruction here. It has been five days and we haven't eaten anything.""An official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which runs detention, confirmed the hunger strikes at the three facilities where they began, but not at the three additional centers. According to the official, 94 individuals had stopped eating: 46 detainees at the Etowah Detention center, 35 detainees at Theo Lacy Immigration Detention Facility and another 13 detainees at Otay Mesa Detention Center. The official said the agency cannot discuss specific cases because of privacy laws.ICE spokesman Richard Rocha said the agency ""takes very seriously the health, safety, and welfare of those in our care and we continue to monitor the situation.""""ICE’s Etowah Detention Center, Theo Lacy Immigration Detention Facility and Otay Mesa Detention Center are staffed with medical and mental health care providers who monitor, diagnose and treat residents at the facility,"" he continued in an emailed statement. ""ICE also uses outside, private medical/mental health care service providers as needed. Individuals at each ICE facility have access to meals served three times daily at the cafeteria, snacks provided by the facility, and/or food purchased from the commissary."" Advocates said 13 men at the Denver Contract Detention Facility are participating in the hunger strike, as are nine at the Adelanto Detention Facility and 17 at the South Texas Detention Facility. Foreign nationals in the U.S., including those in deportation proceedings, can seek asylum to remain in the country if they are determined to have credible fear of returning to their home countries. If officials determine they do, the asylum-seekers in deportation proceedings can plead their case before a judge.Fahd Ahmed said some of the men have pending asylum cases, while others were denied and have a pending appeal. Some others were unable to appeal, he said. It's difficult to find legal representation and build a case for asylum -- a process that involves gathering evidence -- while in detention, he said. ""They're being held in such isolated conditions where they're not only isolated from their families and communities, but also isolated from lawyers that can provide them quality representation,"" he said.Other immigrants in detention have held hunger strikes as well, including women being held with their children, and some have similarly said they faced retaliation for doing so.

15,MEDIA,Star-Ledger Editor Throws Shade On NH Paper's Christie Endorsement,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-endorsement-questioned_us_565ddea1e4b072e9d1c36bd8,"As it turns out, not knowing anything about Chris Christie was the key factor in the New Hampshire Union Leader's decision.",2015-12-01,Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) recently received the endorsement of New Hampshire's largest newspaper.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565de1041700008100e1ad2d.jpeg?cache=u2tsvAgwyu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you were doing anything that even closely resembled ""having a life"" over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, you might have missed the news that the New Hampshire Union Leader handed out a (relatively early) Republican primary endorsement to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.It's a pretty big deal. As Toby Harnden wrote -- so sagely! -- back in 2011, ""It's easy to dismiss the importance of today's endorsement of Newt Gingrich by the New Hampshire Union-Leader."" Indeed. So easy.But not dismissing the paper's latest choice entirely is Tom Moran, the editorial page editor of Christie's home state newspaper, The Star-Ledger. Moran, as it turned out, was very puzzled as to why the Granite State paper endorsed Christie. So he called up his counterpart in Manchester, the Union Leader's editorial page editor, Grant Bosse.They had a nice conversation. Got down to brass tacks. Discussed several matters germane to Christie's record. And afterwards, Moran came away with the story: No one at the Union Leader actually knows what they're talking about.""The [Union Leader] knows almost nothing about his record as governor,"" wrote Moran.Cool, cool, the system works.It's not as if the Union Leader didn't attempt to make a case for Christie. The paper noted that Christie ""has prosecuted terrorists"" and ""dealt admirably with major disasters"" and ""he tells it like it is and isn't shy about it."" And if that sounds like maybe the Union Leader was working off research culled from a coloring book about Chris Christie, well, you aren't the only one to think so. During his talk with Bosse, Moran went over several key details about Christie's governorship, only to discover that Bosse wasn't particularly well-versed in any of them.Just to give you a sense of the level of the room at the Union Leader, ""It has nothing to do with [Christie],"" was Bosse's response to Moran's inquiries about Bridgegate.It gets worse from there. Per Moran:How about pension reform? The board in Manchester did not know that Christie broke his core promise on that by skipping pension payments. ""I don't know if we went into the weeds on pension reform,"" Bosse said.""Durrrrrr,"" replied Bosse. (I'm paraphrasing.)Of course, the strange thing about the Union Leader's endorsement of Christie is the extent to which it's actually a non-endorsement of several other candidates. ""We don't need another fast-talking, well-meaning freshman U.S. senator trying to run the government,"" said the Union Leader of Marco Rubio. ""We don't need as President some well-meaning person from the private sector who has no public experience,"" the paper said of Carly Fiorina.""Other candidates have gained public and media attention by speaking bluntly,"" said the Union Leader of ... well, somebody? Here I thought that ""telling it like it is"" was one of those qualities that these editors held to be important.I guess it's an interesting clash of different points of view. Moran, who's watched Christie up close for over a decade, thinks the governor is a liar. Bosse, who's found something to admire in Christie's romp around the Granite State, believes the New Jersey governor ""knows what he is saying because he has experienced it.""I'll note that it only took about a week for Christie to come around to defending the residents of his state against Donald Trump's slander against them, which is probably the right amount of time to determine whether it was politically smart to do so.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post, and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast, ""So, That Happened.""

Now, he's got a new foe: police misconduct.On Wednesday, DC Comics released the first issue of ""Dark Knight III: Master Race,"" the highly anticipated comic from the legendary Frank Miller, who brought us ""Dark Knight Returns."" This time, instead of taking on the maniacal Joker or the whimsical Riddler, Batman squares off against his local police force. In the opening panels of Miller's new comic, a young black man named Squid is stopped by police, guns pointed at him. ""Getting arrested,” Squid texts a friend. When the friend asks why, he responds, “The man don't need no reason.""Thinking that this is the end, Squid runs away. Batman soon arrives on the scene, beating down the crooked cops.It's the start of a lot of trouble for the caped crusader, who ends up having to fight the entire Gotham Police Department as the officers race to get their hands on the vigilante. Batman “is, politically, a radical and a revolutionary out to overthrow a corrupt police state,” Miller told Vulture in November. “It’s a very patriotic and loyal-to-the-law kind of story, but the established authorities were doing the wrong thing, so it took an outlaw to bring justice.”The comic may have been inspired by recent stories of police brutality against black men, such as the New York City police officer who put Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold and the South Carolina cop who shot and killed Walter Scott.Scott Snyder's ""Batman #44,"" released in September, depicted Batman confronting police brutality and standing with the Black Lives Matter movement. Snyder's story begins with Batman investigating the killing of a black teen in a hoodie who was fatally shot by a white cop. The comic has strong parallels with the killings of Michael Brown and Akai Gurley, both unarmed black men who were shot and killed by police officers."

But as dozens of these unrelated policy measures are dropped, this one is sticking around -- a fact that is especially troubling to net neutrality advocates, who worry it may make its way into a final must-pass spending bill, known as an omnibus.The federal government is currently running on a stopgap funding measure, which will run out on Dec. 11. If Congress doesn't reach a new agreement, the government will shut down.The anti-net neutrality language reads: None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to regulate, directly or indirectly, the prices, other fees, or data caps and allowances (as such terms are described in paragraph 164 of the Report and Order on Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order in the matter of protecting and promoting the open Internet, adopted by the Federal Communications Commission on February 26, 2015.On Feb. 26, the FCC approved strong net neutrality rules that reclassify consumer broadband as a utility under Title II of the Communications Act. In other words, it bans ""paid prioritization,"" a practice allowing Internet service providers to charge content producers a premium for giving users more reliable access to that content.Advocacy groups are already gearing up for a fight, urging net neutrality supporters to reach out to congressional negotiators. ""Congressional leaders are negotiating behind closed doors -- and some are trying to work in language that would reverse the FCC's historic Net Neutrality ruling,"" wrote Sandra Fulton, government relations manager for Free Press, in a recent blog post. ""We worked too hard for that win to let anyone undo it -- let alone in secret. Real leaders don't resort to these kinds of dirty tricks.""Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement to The Huffington Post that Republicans are ""trying to use a procedural backdoor to supersede the FCC and ignore the nearly four million Americans that submitted public comments concerning the FCC’s Net Neutrality rulemaking.""""Republicans need to stop using these riders and procedures that prevent Members from offering amendments to implement their extreme agenda,"" she added. ""As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will keep fighting to defeat this rider and ensure that it is not included in any spending bills.”A spokesperson for Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, did not immediately return a request for comment. Mikulski is a supporter of net neutrality.The potential riders that have been getting the most attention so far are ones tightening screening for Syrian and Iraqi refugees and defunding Planned Parenthood. On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) shrugged off the possibility that Republicans would be willing to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood. But he didn't rule out the inclusion of riders.""How do you write a bill that's not a continuing resolution that doesn't have riders in it?"" McCarthy quipped.Also on HuffPost:"

Adobe announced Tuesday that is replacing Flash Professional, its web animation tool, with a new program called Adobe Animate CC that will launch in January 2016. The name change is indicative of the new program's increased incorporation of HTML5 and decreased reliance on actual Flash. Flash is the software tool that powers the animation you see when you surf the web. It's used by web developers and coders to produce web content on the pages you visit to make them come alive. But it's clunky, it's old, and it's already blocked by some browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox:The end of Flash has been a long time coming -- Adobe scaled back on the development of its Flash Player plug-in for mobile browsers years ago to focus on HTML5, the new industry standard. HTML5 is a newer technology for building and displaying web content. Most developers have already made the switch to producing content exclusively in HTML5, and Adobe has followed suit. It has started incorporating HTML5 into the Flash program for a while now due to its overwhelming popularity and browser support. Steve Jobs even predicted back in 2010 that HTML5 would eventually drive away Flash, according to Gizmodo. And apparently, he was right.  H/T GizmodoAlso on HuffPost:"

There are deadlines at work, children to take to soccer practice, bills to pay. And for some people, especially those who don't consider themselves connected to a specific religion, grappling with the death of a loved one can come with the added challenge of trying to make peace with what it all means on a cosmic level. Author Bob Morris faced these questions while preparing for the deaths of his mother and father, Joe and Ethel. His mother died in 2002, after more than a decade of being ill. His dad passed away a few years later. Morris writes about the what it was like to say goodbye to these two dearly loved ones in his latest memoir, Bobby Wonderful: An Imperfect Son Buries His Parents. Morris was raised in the Jewish tradition, but had stopped attending synagogue regularly by the time his mother died. He identifies now as a spiritually minded person, but not as someone who follows the doctrine of a specific religious tradition.His dad had a similar outlook. Morris said his father lost his faith in God after watching his wife's health suffer for years. One day, while Morris and his brother were sitting around his dad's hospital bed, a rabbi stuck his head in the door and asked if he could come in.Morris' brother welcomed the religious leader into the room, even though Joe declined. Morris calls the experience that followed a ""profoundly beautiful"" encounter unlike anything he had expected. The rabbi led Joe in a meditation that asked him to look back at the lovely things he'd accomplished in his life. Filmmaker Jeff Scher has created a visual interpretation of this meditation: ""That's religion at its best, when it uplifts you, when it's not telling you to pray to God, or think in this way,"" Morris said. ""When it gives you a way to look at living as beautifully as possible. For me, the beauty and comfort of religion that helps the mourning children comes not from strict [doctrine], but what lies beneath that, which is transcendence."" HuffPost Religion chatted with Morris about the experience of losing his parents. It seems to me that the world’s religions have death ""figured out"" in a sense -- they have rituals and theology that gives followers comfort about the departing loved one’s soul, for example. What is it like for someone who is ""spiritual but not religious"" to approach death of a parent?Even though I was trained as Conservative Jew and had had a bar mitzvah and then gone on to further study, that wasn’t a part of my life as much at the time of my parents’ death. But I was able to light shabbat candles in the room of my mother before her death. And when she died, I was able to call the family synagogue, where my brother and I had no affiliation at that point, and have them take over and give form to rituals that we didn’t have to invent, that have been there throughout history. To be able to go to a funeral and have a rabbi pin a black ribbon on your lapel to indicate you’ve torn your clothes, to have a rabbi who is prepared not only to speak about the deceased but also offer prayers of mourning from a little mourning book that I still find quite beautiful. A lot of my generation, and getting into the younger age group as well, we don’t like to think that we’re completely material, earthbound people. So all of these things are a tremendous gift and comfort that religion can provide when you’re facing something that’s never happened to you before. Religion provides some kind of a structure when you’re not yourself. And you’re not yourself when you’re dealing with this.  There are phrases that people who are religious sometimes use to comfort those who are mourning -- things like, ""He/She is in a better place"" or ""God just needed another angel."" Did these ever phrases frustrate you? What are the words of comfort that you felt really did help?""God has another angel"" is sweet, but the other things that people say at times like this, they mean absolutely nothing to me. One of the things I talk about in the book is how one yearns to just be with the deceased parent a moment longer in the days and weeks after a death. If you don’t have a traditional belief in God, but you believe in spirit, what does it mean that God had a plan? That means nothing to me. But if a person who is comforting a mourner like me says, ""I’ll never forget the time your mother picked me up at the library because my car broke down, and we had the most wonderful lunch, and she skipped her beauty parlor appointments"" -- that would be something special. Because even though we weren’t a spectacular family, I think the love and the spirit that was in between all those dark places was strong and spiritual. To me, that’s a form of spirituality that I do believe in.  Did the whole experience change the way you think about God?Not about God, but about religion. I think that it does have such a profound place around families of the dying. I do believe this is a religious book, because nothing is more profound than being there when you see the spirit of a person leaving a body. There is something there that leaves them when they die. What is this other thing that leaves them? Consciousness, maybe.   Aside from the religious rituals, there are also many social/cultural practices associated with death -- like people bringing food and paying visits at the hospital. Did you find these as intrusions, or did they help you grieve? What would you tell friends and family who are trying to be show their support, but are actually causing more harm than good?Everyone’s going to address that in a different way. I’m not speaking for anyone but myself. For me, the whole thing is just a nightmare, unless you’re wealthy and you have an assistant designated to being in charge of it. It seems all we were doing was answering calls and receiving flowers and food. On the other hand, it is a sign that the community is taking over and taking care of you so that you can be cushioned. Some people might also say it’s a distraction, talking with all these people and inviting them to the funeral. It leaves some time where you’re so distracted by planning that the full impact doesn’t hit you until everything’s over and you’re done writing thank you notes. I didn’t really want anybody around in the very last hours of my parents in the hospital. I know that’s selfish, because if these people wanted to be there, they should be there. It’s tricky territory. I think people should be very careful about presuming that their presence is needed and wanted, and let the immediate family who is mourning set the tone. What advice would you have for the spouse or partner of someone who is going through the process of saying goodbye to a parent? What is a good way for them to care for the carer?There’s a lot of listening that can be done with a spouse. The loveliest thing a spouse can do, other than making logistics easier by not being anything but incredibly encouraging about giving the most care you can, is just listening. I remember being able to talk about my dad a lot to my spouse and how much that meant to me. I was so lucky that they had met and that they understood each other. In the book, you talk about the difficulty of maintaining a balance between caring for loved ones while continuing to participate in life outside that space. There seems to be a lot of guilt associated with making that choice. Did you find a good way to negotiate that with your parents and with yourself?Yes. I think the goal of the book is to give others reading it who may be going through something similar, who are caregiving for older parents, permission to take care of themselves. I was pretty keen on not letting the devastating years of my mother’s illness or the last terrible year of my father’s life to completely take me down. One of the things I tell my readers is that there’s a spirituality in happiness. One of the most profoundly happy things that I would do with my dad was sing with him. I got a hold a of a lot of good sheet music and I learned to play. I played in the lobby of the assisted living home where he lived. Instead of speaking, sometimes we’d just sing. I also figured out that I wanted to take drives with him, along this area of Long Island, the North Shore and Great Neck, there are beautiful places to drive. I think the key is to find things that you can do with them that aren’t just dutiful, but something you really enjoy doing in their presence. There were many times when I was visiting my dad where I’d burst into tears of joy because we managed to find that beautiful hour. If you asked me if God was present in any of this, it would be in those times.This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Also on HuffPost:"

Some 300 million light years away, a supermassive black hole has swallowed a star and burped up a jet of matter at nearly the speed of light, an international team of researchers has found.The star is about the size of our sun, but the black hole is 1 million times as massive. So it snared the stellar meal in its gravitational pull, according to Sjoert van Velzen, a Hubble fellow at Johns Hopkins University who led the research.""A star getting swallowed by a black hole is not new, although they are still rare,"" he told The Huffington Post. ""Only a few dozen of these unlucky stars have been observed so far. What is new about our study is that we first saw, in great detail, the star getting torn apart and then found the high-speed outflow -- aka the jet.""The researchers have observed this star since scientists in Ohio discovered it in 2014. Velzen's team continued observations when they realized that the the radio light from the star was rapidly changing and that something intriguing was going on.With the help of NASA's swift satellite, the scientists could say with confidence that the changes came from the newly launched jet of charged particles. In other words, the black hole burped up debris left from the star's destruction.""From our observations, it looks like jets are a common response from black holes that are that subjected to more gas than they can swallow at once,"" Velzen said.However, the astrophysicists still aren't sure exactly how they work, from what they're entirely made of or how the jets are launched.A Harvard team also observing the hungry black hole put their observations online last month. ""The Harvard team observed the same source, but with a different radio telescope --they used the Very Large Array, in New Mexico,"" Velzen said. ""They were the first to put their results online, while we were the first to get our work published in a journal. So we both get our claim to fame.""Both teams plan to continue observations. The research was published in the journal Science on Thursday.Also on HuffPost:"
