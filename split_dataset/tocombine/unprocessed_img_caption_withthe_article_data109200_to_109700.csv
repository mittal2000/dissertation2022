1,MEDIA,Top Obama Adviser Dismisses Media 'Fake' Uproar Over 'Latte Salute',Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dan-pfeiffer-latte-salute_n_5883012.html,,2014-09-25,"MEET THE PRESS -- Pictured: (l-r) ? Dan Pfeiffer, White House Senior Adviser, appears on 'Meet the Press' in Washington, D.C., Sunday, May 19, 2013. (Photo by: William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5bfd22200004301dc8644.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK –- Dan Pfeiffer said Thursday that the president’s ""latte salute,"" the Twitter-fueled media outrage of the week, epitomizes just ""how fake the whole conversation"" around politics can be. Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama and a longtime communications operative, said that ""no one in the political sphere"" trying to make a story out of the president greeting a couple of saluting Marines with a beverage in hand ""actually believes that this somehow indicates some disrespect."" (And for the record: Obama was drinking tea, not coffee.) ""It's just like, 'Here's a gotcha moment. We know it's not real,'"" Pfeiffer said. ""The Republican operatives who push around know it's not real. The press knows it's not real, but everyone's got to cover it and play the whole game."" Pfeiffer described the relationship between the press and the White House during an hourlong discussion Thursday morning with BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith at a breakfast event attended by the site's staffers and a few outside reporters. They talked about how both legacy news outlets and the White House have lost some degree of control in today's more fragmented media environment and how an image as seemingly benign as the president holding a cup, published by the White House's own Instagram account, can quickly go viral. Pfeiffer also addressed the coverage of race involving America's first black president, breaking through the unceasing news cycle, and what the White House gets out of Obama's off-the-record meetings with columnists. One way for the White House to cut through the media clutter, Pfeiffer suggested, is by surprising the press. That was the case last year when Obama made an unexpected appearance in the White House briefing room and spoke passionately about his personal experience with racial bias just days after George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the killing of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. Pfeiffer said that the lack of advance warning meant the president's talk would ""pop on the Internet in a way it would not have otherwise."" The strategy also prevented cable news hosts and pundits from pontificating for an hour beforehand about what the president might say and what it might mean, Pfeiffer said. The White House could ""own the moment in a way before it felt old."" On race matters broadly, Smith mentioned an article last month by Vox’s Ezra Klein -- a writer Pfeiffer acknowledged the president reads regularly –- about how Obama didn’t give a similarly heartfelt speech following unrest over the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Pfeiffer said that it's both ""harder and easier"" for Obama to speak about race. It’s more difficult, he said, because Obama's comments on race come ""with a whole host of political complications for the president"" and are ""covered in a different way than if someone else did it."" But Obama’s the only U.S. president who could have spoken in such a way about the injustice many felt following the Zimmerman verdict, Pfeiffer said, and ""has the most relevant, personal biographical understanding of what happened in Ferguson."" ""I think that race is a complicated issue on its own, if it's a conversation happening at your dinner table,"" Pfeiffer said. ""When it happens in the context of politics and then is covered by the political press, it gets even more complicated.""Dealing with the press is already far more complicated for the White House than it was a generation, or perhaps even a decade, ago. There once was a time when the White House had to be concerned with just a few broadcast networks, the major newspapers and the leading wire services, like the Associated Press. But the Internet disrupted everything, and the social media conversation now churns non-stop. These days, Pfeiffer said, the top legacy media outlets ""can't set the agenda [the way] they did before.""Overall, Pfeiffer suggested, that's a good thing for the American public. For instance, he said, ""if we had today's media in 2002, we would have had a very different discussion about the Iraq War."" He said there would likely have been more skeptical viewpoints and greater pressure put on the Bush administration to back up its false claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The downside, he said, is that ""sometimes things that are either incorrect or malicious or distracting can become part of the national narrative, because you lose, for good or ill, the policing of the major media outlets.""Washington reporters have been rankled at times by the Obama team’s strategy of often turning to nontraditional outlets, like the late-night talk shows and more celebrity-focused media. Pfeiffer said the White House isn’t trying to go around the press corps, the traditional media filter, but is looking to reach the public in a variety of ways. ""It’s not an either/or; it’s an and/both strategy,"" he said. The president sat down with ""Meet the Press"" moderator Chuck Todd for his first time as host, Pfeiffer said, because it was an opportunity to discuss major issues at a time when that conversation would get the most attention. He noted that Obama also sits down with influential columnists to get his views across. The Huffington Post asked Pfeiffer about off-the-record White House meetings with influential columnists and commentators, the most recent of which took place just hours before Obama's primetime address on the escalation of the U.S. fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.   Pfeiffer replied that one segment of the traditional media that’s only ""grown more powerful, not less powerful,"" is opinion journalism. Now, he said, readers turn to opinion leaders on Twitter, their blogs or television -- and not just in print columns appearing days after a speech. ""They have a lot of followers and they carry a lot of influence,"" he said. It was significant, Pfeiffer said, when writer Andrew Sullivan and MSNBC host Chris Matthews -- two media figures presumed to be in the president’s corner on most issues –- criticized Obama's performance in the first 2012 election debate against Mitt Romney so harshly. He recalled fielding questions from journalists about how the pair appeared ready to ""commit ritual suicide"" online and on television. ""It will influence all the coverage of it,"" Pfeiffer said of opinion makers' first take on an event. ""It is a sign to all the reporters who are writing at that moment -- Obama's speech was such a failure, even progressive Columnist X thought it was a failure.'""""There is no time between the end of the speech and when someone opines on it to get to them,"" he added. ""So you actually have to get to them before the speech to explain why it is you’re doing what you’re doing."""

Certainly far less than a hundredth of its weight. But because of these tusks -- their teeth -- tens of thousands of elephants die each year. I've been studying a population of African elephants in Kenya's Samburu National Reserve for the last 17 years -- how they interact, why they move, where they go, and how they make decisions. This offered the chance to really get to know different families of elephants, watch them be born, grow up, and have children of their own. With Save the Elephants, I have identified and named more than 1000 elephants and their families -- like Queen Elizabeth of the Royals, Rosemary of the Spice Girls, and Ebony of the Hardwoods families. But it also means that I have watched many of them die. Witnessed their young become orphans. Seen the destruction of entire families and the annihilation of the great male tuskers. Trying to reconstruct the killing of Bonsai of the Hardwoods family was one of the worst -- seeing the bush she was feeding on, the blood trail originating from the initial bullet strike, and the markings from when her tusk dug into the earth as her feet slipped. But she managed to rise again, was shot again, and still walked over two miles before she succumbed. We found her orphans a few days later, staying with their aunt but terrified by innocuous sounds like the wind in the acacia trees. The social fabric of elephant societies across the continent is rapidly being shredded. Bonsai's orphans a week after their mother's death: over a year later, they continue to stay together and rebuild their lives. We've known that poaching of elephants has been increasing rapidly. But for the first time, we have numbers to show how many elephants have been killed for ivory across the continent in a new paper we published in the Proceedings of National Academies of Science this week. The numbers are unfathomable. 100,000 individual elephants have been killed for their tusks in three years across the entire African continent. Our research shows that the tipping point for the species was reached in 2010, when the numbers of elephants being killed began to drive an actual decline in the species.Why is this happening? Over the last several years the demand for ivory art and trinkets has increased, driving up the price of ivory to a level that has attracted militants and professional criminal traffickers (those moving drugs, humans, weapons). This has propelled the rise in poaching rates. Now, three quarters of all elephant populations are declining. Across African ecosystems populations are being exterminated, and with their loss goes the services they provide (e.g., habitat enhancement, tourism value). But there are exceptions. Our analysis indicates that 1/4 of elephant populations are stable or increasing. They are gems of successful conservation in the face of enormous pressure from ivory markets; examples that desperately need to be replicated.The 100,000 dead does not adequately capture the full impact of the killing on elephants. Ivory poaching targets individuals with the largest tusks, the primary breeding males, the matriarchs of families, and the mothers of the young. Elephants are intelligent and sensitive with familial bonds similar in strength to those humans experience. These killings leave behind orphans, left to fend for themselves where they may be adopted into another family or grasp onto a particularly nurturing adolescent female taking on the responsibility of leading much earlier than should be required. It has been a terrible thing to systematically record this process as it plays out in the lives of elephants we know, but also inspiring to bear witness to their resilience in the wake of these killings.The local communities in northern Kenya have been critical to diminish the epidemic of killings where we work. Coordinated interventions and the intelligence they share with us, the Kenya Wildlife Service and our partners have helped change continuous elephant poaching to sporadic and opportunistic killings. This success is occurring across many sights in Africa, lead by a coalition of private citizens, government and non-government organizations. But the cost has been enormous, in terms of dollars, human lives and elephants in the process. Just recently, a local community scout in our area was killed. Meanwhile professional rangers are continuing to die to protect the iconic species.The lessons of the last elephant killing spree in the 1970s and 80s taught us that pressure on elephants will only abate when demand for ivory is curbed. Education and awareness campaigns on the killings to feed the ivory markets repulsed the primary consumers of that era (primarily western and Japanese), breaking the back of the last episode of killing. Conservationists are fighting to replicate this globally again. Excellent work is being conducted to inundate the primary consumers with messaging regarding what buying figurines, chop sticks and works of art does to wild elephants. The groups need to be supported and helped to succeed. Numbers matter. They can elicit action and measure success. Now we have them on the scale of illegal killing. We can identify the populations most at threat. We know the primary ivory consuming nations, and even their relative importance. We know what to do and where to do it. It is time for global leaders to act on this information. Global support for range nations in Africa, particularly those that have shown initiative and are demonstrating success, must be enhanced. Where they aren't, the non-governmental partners should be supported. Most importantly, the primary consuming nations must take responsibility for the devastation their consumption is causing. They must act to undermine demand, publicize the impact of ivory consumption on wild elephants in Africa, and close their domestic markets in which illegal ivory is being sold as legal ivory. The latter is critical, as end market illegal ivory laundering is the linchpin in this chain. Sanctions eliminating commerce in endangered species should be enacted on those that do not.We know what to do, it is time to do it. Elephants don't have the time to wait.George Wittemyer is the Scientific Board Chairman of Save the Elephants and an Assistant professor in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University."

Remember when Rush Limbaugh denigrated Sandra Fluke as a ""slut"" and a ""prostitute"" for daring to talk in public about birth control? Bozell's MRC subordinates were totally down with that, while Bozell himself could muster no criticism of Limbaugh stronger than ""Let's all agree Limbaugh crossed a line,"" then launched an ""I Stand With Rush"" website.On the same day that Bozell and Graham demanded the cancellation of The Daily Show for offenses to the public discourse, they attack those who call out Limbaugh's offenses to the public discourse.In a September 24 NewsBusters post, Graham regurgitated Limbaugh's bitter attack on a campaign to dissuade businesses from advertising on Limbaugh's show because of his offenses to the public discourse, regurgitating unsubstantiated claims that the campaign is nothing but ""leftist ... agitators trying to ruin his program among advertisers."" Graham whines: ""Ever since the national Limbaugh show began in 1989, the Left has been eager to 'Flush Rush' and get his show cancelled. Liberals don't really believe in free speech or a vigorous battle of ideas.""Bozell, meanwhile, cranked up the outrage machine, declaring the campaign to be ""a blatant left-wing attack on the First Amendment"" from ""a small handful of hacks trying to intimidate small business owners who advertise on conservative radio."" Bozell went on to rant:The ultra-left's hatred of conservative media and conservative voices is so extreme that they're willing to put mom and pop shops across America out of business to silence them. Hate is the only word to describe what they're doing. Let's get this straight: Bozell and Graham -- who are nothing if not small-time hacks despite the millions in donations the MRC rakes in -- demand the cancellation of The Daily Show for offending their conservative sensibilities, then turn around and rant against a group of liberals seeking to cancel the radio show of their right-wing buddy. (Remember, the MRC gave Limbaugh its inaugural ""William F. Buckley, Jr. Award for Media Excellence"" in 2007.)With their attack on The Daily Show, Bozell and Graham have demonstrated that they're the ones who don't believe in free speech. Apparently, their concerns about preserving ""the civil discourse"" apply only to liberals -- as far as they're concerned, right-wingers like Limbaugh have free rein to be as uncivil and disgusting as they want.Like we said, the hypocrisy is breathtaking."

The placard reads 'Arrest all accused in the gang rape."" (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae511e200000e800ff406c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Daily life for every woman living in India is characterized by being whistled at, stared, stalked, harassed or even being threatened by strange men. In fact, most of these are not even considered out of the ordinary. The body of a woman is believed to be the property of the shopkeeper whose gaze is transfixed at your neckline as you buy a bottle of water, the traffic police officer who stares at you from the top to the bottom when you ask for directions, or the creepy relative that has leered at you at every family event.   As Indian women, we train ourselves to ignore these men. We are told not to confront them, not to voice our anger because that may invite greater harassment.  A year ago, I packed my bags and arrived in the United States to begin my undergraduate academic career. I am studying at a liberal arts college where every woman is taught to have a voice of her own. I thought that I was so ready for that. But what I wasn't prepared for was that I would soon be swamped with questions about the condition of women in India. The reason for this sudden international attention on Indian women was the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a moving bus in December 2012.   For someone brought up in the Indian capital, I was immune to seeing newspapers routinely run such news for years. But the story of this woman, however, was different. I saw the entire country stand up and protest in outrage. It even captured global debate.  This was not limited to merely to the media. It entered my undergraduate classroom as well.  The subject of discussion was the role of women in the development of a nation. And the discussion veered toward violence against women and I was eventually asked to express my feelings on the recent Indian case. It should have been easy for me to express the same outrage here in the classroom 7,000 miles away.  But I found deeply conflicted and uneasy. Being away from home, I was not only homesick, but also felt strangely defensive and patriotic about India. The Indian in me only grew stronger. Was I going to speak up in my classroom as a woman or as an Indian?  After all, during my first weeks away from home, I had watched the Bollywood movie Kuch Kuch Hota Hai every time I felt homesick. Every time I spoke of my country, I felt my chest swell with pride thinking of the diversity in food, culture, clothing and languages. But now I found myself unable to balance this troubling paradox of being Indian and the ghosts of ceaseless sexual violence against women.   This battle between nationalism and feminism is wrenching.   When I say that our society is known for its long history of discrimination against women, I am not forgetting that there are cases like this taking place on my own college campus here as well. However, the difference lies in the stigma attached to a woman who experiences sexual violence in my country. Most women are silenced and unable to even relate their trauma because our culture seems to blame the victim for inviting violence.  I remember waking up to several news notifications on my smartphone about another 22-year-old journalist who was gang raped in Mumbai last year, India's so-called safe city. Sitting halfway across the world, I was unable to control my emotions. Unfortunately, while the word Delhi flashes images of friends and family, it also stands for fear and embarrassment that I often feel. The condition of women in our country is a disgrace, I feel myself turning red with shame every time it is discussed. Yes, in the last two years, people have begun openly talking about things that were earlier only whispered. But where are we going with all the talking?  As I struggled to iron out my own internal contradictions so far away from home, I found my voice a month ago. It was a strident one.  India's finance minister Arun Jaitley said at a public event last month that ""one small incident of rape in Delhi -- advertised world-over -- is enough to cost us billions of dollars in terms of lower tourism.""  He was weighing the national loss in terms of tourism revenue with the incident of brutal rape.  I was instantly outraged. But in my response, I was reminded about my own difficulty in talking about rape in my classroom.  My true patriotic impulse is to rise up and declare my intolerance toward rising sexual assaults, not in papering over them. To question the system is the first step toward reforming the system. And that is a truly patriotic act."

(Photo by Chris Rainier)To support those efforts, the National Geographic Enduring Voices Project has just launched two new ""Talking Dictionaries"" for Yokoim and Panim, two small and endangered languages making their internet debut in 2014.Yokoim is spoken by under 2,000 people in three small villages in the Karawari River basin of Papua New Guinea. Locals travel only by dugout canoe, while outsiders fly in by small planes that land on a dirt airstrip cleared out in the jungle. Though most children in the Yokoim community prefer to speak Tok Pisin, the national language, a proud speaker named Luis Kolisi composes and sings original songs in the language. Video recordings of Luis' songs provide a way for his unwritten language to be shared on the internet. Nick Waikai, headman of Manjamai village, told our research team about a mythical hero named Waka who brought survival skills to his people. As the tale goes, Waka was captured by river spirits and taken to live underwater for a month. The netherworld spirits schooled Waka in skills such as canoe making, hunting, and bow and arrow making. When Waka emerged from underwater into the world of the living, he taught his Yokoim people those skills. Now the Yokoim are seeking a new set of skills for the digital age.Panim is spoken by under 400 people in a single village (also called Panim) near the northeast coast of Papua New Guinea, and is highly endangered. When linguists Greg Anderson and David Harrison visited the village on a Saturday in August 2009, almost the entire village population was busy attending Seventh Day Adventist church services. One man, Lihot Wagadu, who was not at church sat down with the linguists and shared some of his language.The new Talking Dictionaries, hosted at Swarthmore College, contain the first available recordings of Yokoim and Panim. As both are unwritten languages, the dictionaries use the International Phonetic Alphabet, a system used by linguists to represent the sounds of any language. It is a true milestone as Yokoim and Panim cross the digital divide and establish a very first internet presence. That these tongues, likely never before heard outside of remote villages in Papua New Guinea, can now reach a global audience, shows a positive value of globalization. By learning about such far-flung and remote cultures, and the ideas, songs, and experiences they choose to share with us, we may learn to value them and perhaps contribute to their survival.Yokoim speaker Luis Kolisi (left) and linguist Greg Anderson interview Ivino Sabakui (right), a speaker of the Womut language.

Thousands were forcibly evacuated from their homes after heavy rains caused flooding in major parts of the metropolis, shutting down schools and government offices. (Photo by Dondi Tawatao/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15ebe2200005700db49d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Growing up, my friends and I looked forward to the monsoon season as it meant we would have the opportunity to play in the rain. With no guilt, we would pray that our area would be declared under the Storm Warning Signal No. 3 which would mean that classes would be cancelled and we would have the day off to run in the rain. Back then, typhoons were rarely synonymous to disasters. Thus, it strikes me to disbelief every time I am reminded that the climate, in a span of about two decades, has changed so drastically that I can stand witness to it. The monsoon rains and the winds that come with them evoke fear among the Filipinos -- they worry about when the next typhoon will come, where it will make landfall, how much damage it will cause, and how many lives it will take. As a child, I saw that the rain would have the effect of cleansing the ground, clearing the dust that has accumulated during the dry summer months. Today, as soon as the rain leaves, I worry about how much rubble I will see on the ground and how many people have been reduced to mere statistics to account for the number of injured, or worst -- the number of deaths. The Philippines is not able to adapt fast enough to the increasing severity of weather conditions. Almost a year after the super typhoon Haiyan, people still live in tents -- bare and exposed to another season of typhoons. In July, typhoon Rammasun made landfall and brought heavy rains and strong winds in the already battered city of Tacloban. Fear and panic caused by their bitter experience forced the traumatized Haiyan survivors back to the evacuation center they fled to eight months ago. Now the United Nations will host a Climate Summit at its Headquarters in New York on 23 September, with more than 120 Heads of State participating, to mobilize political will and highlight actions being taken to address climate change. And although the Summit is not part of the negotiations on climate actions and commitments, it provides an occasion to set the tone for the climate negotiations in Peru in December and Paris in 2015. I have been given the privilege to be among the civil society representatives selected to attend through a global nomination process conducted by the UN Non-Governmental Liaison Service. This opportunity will allow me to amplify the voices of people like me who have been impacted by and who remain vulnerable to climate change, and to ensure that the voices of those in the frontline will be heard in yet another arena.For us who belong to affected communities, the effects of a warming planet due to the failure to address the climate crisis impose upon us greater risks and increased vulnerability. And although we appreciate the global assistance and mobilization from around the globe, we want to remind the world that our experience with Haiyan is not a matter of charity or outreach but is the consequence of the failure to address the climate crisis. Therefore, we have to maximize all avenues provided to us to bring forward the issues and solutions that are important for our survival.Thus, we urge the Heads of State to take strong strides to keep up with the fast changing climate and to commit to alleviating the effects of global warming. We demand an ambitious, drastic, and immediate emissions cut. We demand an energy transformation that will ban new dirty energy projects and transition towards accessible, democratic, sustainable and clean energy that is community-based and managed, and publicly controlled.We call for a strong and serious commitment from developed countries to help peoples with their adaptation needs, to ensure that loss and damages mechanisms are in place, and to guarantee the transfer of finance and technology to assist with the climate crisis.And because the warming planet is a global issue, every country must work collectively to resolve the climate crisis. This Climate Summit could provide one of the arenas to build up that collective effort and to ensure the survival of the people who belong to most vulnerable communities.This post is part of a month-long series produced by The Huffington Post in conjunction with a variety of events being held in September recognizing the threats posed by climate change. Those events include the UN's Climate Summit 2014 (that was held Sept. 23, 2014, at UN headquarters in New York) and Climate Week NYC (Sept. 22-28, 2014, throughout New York City).

12,TASTE,You Can Has Cheezburger: A Guide To Potential Cheeses And What Toppings to Pair Them With,"Epicurious, ContributorThe most trusted, authoritative and award-winning digital voic...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/you-can-has-cheezburger-a_b_5875886.html,Can one really stick to just one type of cheese with just one combination of toppings? Answer: Absolutely not.,2014-09-24,2014-09-24-6a00d83451cb0369e201b8d06cb66d970c800wi.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-24-6a00d83451cb0369e201b8d06cb66d970c800wi-thumb.jpg,"by Matt DuckorCheeseburgers, man.We could eat them every day for the rest of our lives barring the serious health concerns that go along with that. The mere suggestion of the idea that there's a National Cheeseburger Day is preposterous (yes, even more so than the rest of the many hilariously bad food holidays). Yes, we've already laid down the ten burger commandments. Sure, our friends at Bon Appétit have concocted a pretty damn great ""deluxe"" burger. But, the question remains: Can one really stick to just one type of cheese with just one combination of toppings?Answer: Absolutely not. In our minds, nearly any cheese is acceptable on a burger. The cheeseburger at Husk in Charleston, SC [Photo: Matt Duckor]While we've just endorsed and thereby given you the freedom to use any cheese you well please on your burger, there are guidelines to follow when pairing toppings with different cheese. What follows are a set of ideas:(A quick note about quality: Obviously, you don't want to go raid the cheese cart at your local four-starred white tablecloth joint, but you don't want to be using processed singles either. Find the Goldilocks compromise.) American: This is the golden standard for the classic American hamburger. Everyone from In-N-Out to chefs like Husk's Sean Brock look to American cheese for its supreme meltability. If you're looking for a cheese to go with an archetypal burger topped with crisp lettuce, juicy tomato, bread and butter pickles, and raw onions you can go ahead and look no further. Cheddar: There's pretty much only one topping to go on a cheddar burger--bacon. It doesn't matter if you're getting the standard stuff from the supermarket, opting for the thick-cut variety from a place like Nueske's, or tossing a slab of fatty pork belly on your burger, you should not be pairing it with anything besides cheddar. Monterey Jack: The meltability is strong with this one. You'll often see this semi-hard cheese on South Western-style burgers topped with green chilies and other exotic ingredients. SEE MORE: Pizza to Try Before You DieBlue: If you're not a fan of blue cheese outside of the burger realm, chances are you're not going love to it on a burger either. But if you do want to take the funky plunge, take a cue from April Bloomfield's excellent Spotted Pig burger and skip all toppings--the heft of beef and stink of blue cheese will be enough to handle. Provolone: You'll often see this relatively mild cheese paired with lettuce, onion, and oven-dried tomato. And you should totally substitute raw tomatoes for their more flavor-concentrated cousin. But we also like to top our provolone burgers with sauteéd mushrooms for a bit of earthy goodness. Fancy Cheeses (gruyère,comté, brie, taleggio, fontina): We love thinking outside the box with something a bit higher-end. Any of the cheeses recommended above, we'd opt for a heaping pile of caramelized onions to add sweetness and counteract a bit of the funk.
