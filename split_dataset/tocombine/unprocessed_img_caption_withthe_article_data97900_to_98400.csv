If you're a parent, you can probably relate to this dilemma: Two socks go into the washer, are transferred to the dryer (hopefully after only one wash, two MAX, pending any re-washing due to wet towels that you forgot about overnight... darn!) and yet only ONE little baby sock resurfaces.But why? Where did the other sock go? Sure, this happens to adult socks too. But the loss is not as prevalent as it is with those itty bitty baby socks. Baby socks may be adorably cute, but they are oh-so annoying when we can't find their mates. In the absence of a matching pair, I'm often forced to do the following:1. Mix and match socks (apparently that's a trend in middle school, so new parents have THAT going for them in oh, a DOZEN years).2. Buy new socks (um, no).3. Make my kid wear yesterday's stinky socks.4. Transition my child from sneakers to sandals pre-summer. (Good luck, kid. Stay warm!)A better parent might organize his or her laundry more efficiently, perhaps utilizing those handy-dandy net bags that keep everything tidy. Honestly, I'm lucky if I finish sorting the laundry before I give up and put the clean laundry back into the basket to tackle another day. Eeeeesh.And forget the parenting magazine advice that recommends folding laundry as a great co-activity. Have those authors ever enlisted their tots in this activity? What starts out as a fun, family folding party quickly turns into kids running around naked with undies on their heads throwing clothes ""in the air like they just don't care."" Hootenanny. (Good intentions, sure, but successful, no.) So, back to the dilemma. Where are all the baby socks?That we have different sized socks in our house only adds to the confusion. (Again, a better parent would probably separate the adult, preschooler and baby laundry). Me, no! Apparently, I like a challenge! I'm Type A, after all! (Exclamation points!) Maybe I want to thwart early onset mental illness. It's my sudoku of sorts. (Sure.)Thus, I sort the clothing into about a dozen piles. T-shirts, shorts, pants, undies and socks x 3 (adult, child, baby). INSANE. Where do the missing socks go? Here are five possible scenarios:1. All missing baby socks are trapped in the same unforgiving black hole at the very back of the dryer where all socks go to die... which is really one big anxiety-inducing fire hazard. (Shudder. Let's move on.)2. Only ONE sock made it into the laundry basket to be washed, while the mate is a) safely hidden under the bed, or b) currently doubling as a mitten on an unsuspecting doll or stuffed animal. (Sorry, Care Bear.) 3. Inadvertently, the sad sock was paired with a wrong mate during wine-induced folding, which went something like this: We couldn't find the mate so we paired it with a different sock that was-close-enough-a-match-to the-original, thus re-branding the pair as the new official set. What we didn't realize is that this only perpetuates the cycle... forcing us to repeat the offense over and over again... (More wine?) 4. Thanks to the modern marvel of static electricity, the missing sock is now stuck to another piece of clothing (pants, t-shirt, undies). Most likely, the sock is trapped in the far corner of an already tucked-in clean bottom bed sheet, right? Have fun finding that one! (Mom 0... Sock 1.) 5. Finally and most likely, that darn baby sock is in the car. You know it is. Because we all know that tots just looooove to take off their socks and shoes, right? All hail the hippy baby! They JUST WANT. THOSE. CONSTRICTING. SOCKS. AND. SHOES. OFF! So yes, it's very likely that the missing sock was released from its entrapment, skydiving to freedom... landing safely on the cheerio-infested floorboard -- never to be heard from or seen again. Frustrating? Yes. The end of the world? No.It's just socks, after all. :)Jennie Sutherland lives in Austin, Texas, with her husband and their two daughters.

4,ENTERTAINMENT,Ewan McGregor On The Challenges Of Playing Jesus,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ewan-mcgregor-last-days-in-the-desert_n_6585926.html,,2015-02-02,"PARK CITY, UT - JANUARY 25: Ewan McGregor attends 'Last Days In The Desert' Premiere during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival at the Eccles Center Theatre on January 25, 2015 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by George Pimentel/Getty Images for Sundance)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a113260000300182695e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ewan McGregor's sandals are following in the footsteps of Max von Sydow, Willem Dafoe, Robert Powell, Christian Bale and Jim Caviezel. With ""Last Days in the Desert,"" which premiered last week at the Sundance Film Festival, McGregor becomes the latest to take on the role of Jesus. Unlike the other actors' projects, which dramatize or twist the events of the Gospels, the details of McGregor's portrayal aren't plucked directly from scripture. Yet, to the credit of writer/director Rodrigo García (""Albert Nobbs,"" ""Six Feet Under""), it would be hard to call the film non-biblical. Set during the final leg of Jesus' 40-day fast in the wilderness of Judea, ""Last Days in the Desert"" finds the holy man encountering, first, Satan (also played by McGregor), who fills his head with self-doubt, and, soon after, a family (Ciarán Hinds, Tye Sheridan and Ayelet Zurer) dealing with their own father-son issues. The desert dwellers he encounters are not figures from Christian credo, allowing the film to fill in holes in a chapter of Jesus' life that isn't fully enunciated in the Bible. Shot by Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity,"" ""Birdman"") in Southern California's Anza-Borrego Desert, ""Last Days"" is a meditation on the notions of faith and spiritual nourishment, particularly as they relate to familial struggles. HuffPost Entertainment sat down with McGregor at Sundance to discuss the inevitable controversy that stems from a nonconventional take on the son of God.Did you grow up with a religious background? I didn’t. I grew up in a small town in Scotland, and Christianity was part of our schooling, I suppose. I went to Sunday school as a kid. At school, special occasions were marked, like Easter and Christmas, and the school was attached to a church that we had music things in. But I didn’t have religious parents and I wasn’t brought up in a religious way, no. How did playing Jesus come about? I met Rodrigo on holiday. Our DP, Emmanuel Lubezki, is a friend of mine. Our daughters are friends, so we know each other. We hadn’t worked together; just our kids are in school together. We went to spend Christmas with them down in Mexico, and Rodrigo was there and another friend of theirs. We got on very well; it was a great holiday and we all had a great time. It was a nice experience. After that, I got sent this script from his producer. They said to me that Rodrigo was embarrassed to come forward to me because we’d met socially and he didn’t want to suddenly break that relationship. I read the script because I really like him and I think that’s more important than anything else with your director, that you get on. Did you find yourself reading the Bible to prepare for the film? I did. I read a lot of different things. I read, of course, some of the passages of the Bible. I read some books that have been written about Jesus, but I didn’t choose them very well. I read books that were mainly trying to take the religiousness or take the Bible out of the Jesus story and focus on who he really was, and I found them to be not of any use to me because I was playing Jesus whose father is God. That’s who Rodrigo had written about. Although we are showing, I hope, a Jesus who is a man and who is a human being, he’s also the son of God. So these books I was reading that were sort of trying to remove the spin, if you’d like -- that’s what I suppose their intention was -- weren’t helping me anyway. In the end, as I usually do with research, I get to a point where I’m not an academic person and I find that the sort of academic research for a character leads me not to anything I’m going to be able to play. So I sort of swept it all aside and started thinking about, ""Who am I playing?"" I’m playing a man who’s trying to speak to his dad and he’s having problems speaking to his dad. And when I made it more simple like that, it became much more easy to play, or it became more obvious to me how I was going to play it. Anytime someone is cast as Jesus there's a camp that's angry because he doesn't fit their image of what Jesus looked like. What do you say to anyone who challenges your casting as a white man, considering he's thought to have been Middle Eastern? I am a white man and I was offered this part and I said yes. I wasn’t going to turn it down because I’m not. That was it. Everything outside of Jesus trekking through the desert seems not to have been culled from the Bible. No, and it’s not a biblical movie. It’s a film about the relationships between fathers and sons, I think. All of the scenes are about that, really. There are a few scenes between the boy and his mother, so in broader terms, a film about the relationship between parents and their children, you could say. But there are many more scenes about fathers and sons than anything else, so it wasn’t really a film attempting to tell a story about Jesus from the Bible. This story isn’t in the Bible, but it is, I hope, the Jesus from the Bible. I like to think people who are religious, people who do believe, and there’s a wonderful piece written in Christianity Today that suggests that: that although the story is not in the Bible, it does feel like the Jesus from the Bible. Would it bother you if religious moviegoers condemn the film because it isn't a fundamentalist adaptation? Yes, I would probably be disappointed. I think so. I’m sensitive about my work; I care about it. And I would feel that I’d failed if people felt like that. There might be people who don’t believe that we should invent stories roundabout the figure of Jesus. Now that’s not something I can answer to. I don’t feel that way, but I’m respectful of people’s different opinions, so I would respect somebody if they felt that way. But I would hope even if that was the case that they wouldn’t watch my portrayal of Jesus and feel like I’d done him a disservice. I would be upset if somebody thought that because I really felt the responsibility of playing him and I tried to live up to that responsibility every day. Talk to me about filming the dual role of Jesus and the devil, which often required you to act opposite yourself. Did you have someone feeding you lines? I had an actor to work with. I had Nash Edgerton, who’s been my stunt double since ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Episode II"" and ""Episode III"" of the ""Star Wars"" films, and many, many films we’ve worked on together. He’s also a filmmaker, he’s a director, and he’s acted with me as well in a couple of films. In ""Son of a Gun,"" he plays our getaway driver. He was coordinating our cliff stunt, which is a quite dangerous sequence on the cliff with real actors going over the edge. It had to be very safe, and it was very safe. Because he was organizing that, I asked him to play opposite me in these scenes. So he learned and performed the scenes with me. I would be Jesus first and he would be the devil, and we would swap and then shoot the other side of the scene. Sometimes we’re looking over his shoulder, sometimes his hands. But it’s only because I was playing with somebody who was playing those scenes with me that it works as well as it does. I’ve seen it not work so well, you know, somebody acting with themselves, if you like. I did a film called ""The Island"" with Michael Bay, and I was playing a clone of somebody and there were scenes where the clone meets the person he’s cloned from, so I had experienced it before. But it works best like that, when you’ve got somebody that’s not just feeding you lines but actually playing the scene with you.What's it like working on a movie shot by Emmanuel Lubezki? What's his process? He’s an extraordinary artist, and I think the truth is I don’t know. I don’t know what his process was for ""Gravity"" because I wasn’t there. It’s almost, how could that man have shot this film? And this film and ""The Tree of Life""? They’re so different from one another. So that’s why he’s a real artist, because he’s making the film look like the film should look, and it’s got nothing to do with the last one. What I will say is I loved watching him with Rodrigo. I don’t know how far their relationship goes back, but it's a long, long way. They were like two halves of a brain. They would disagree about some things, very rarely, but Chivo totally challenges himself. He never used any lights. Out of a 24-day shoot, he used lights for two days of it: the interior of the tent and two or three scenes at night -- he’d use a few lights. Other than that, he was using natural light. As moviegoers, we feel like we should expect a certain artistry with Lubezki's movies. Do you find that he's different from other DP's? We never shot the two angles of a scene in the same location ever. So we would play a scene like this, they would shoot you, and then we would walk miles to find the next place to shoot me. So the two backgrounds have got nothing to do with each other usually. I’d be interested to do a film with him -- God, I’d love to work with him again on anything -- but it would be interesting to work with him where he is lighting, maybe where we’re shooting green-screen work. It would be fascinating to see that side of him because here he was using what we had. And he was using the time of day more efficiently. It’s the desert, so you have a little poetic license there, I guess. But it was very rare that we would shoot this way, turn the camera and shoot that way. We’d always be walking in between those two things. It's really the opposite of ""Gravity."" Right. He always wanted to be shooting when the sun was coming up. Those hours just after the sun came up, and sometimes depending on the cloud base, that period of time would last longer than others. Some days you had really beautiful light until 9 o’clock in the morning. Other days you had beautiful light until 11 o’clock in the morning because there was clouds. It would just depend -- and then the period of time just a couple hours before the sunset and after the sun has set, that beautiful window of light. He was sort of painting with that. He was using the sun and the time of day to make this picture. So we very rarely would be shooting stuff in the middle of the day or on either side of lunch. It was usually time for rehearsal and finding locations.I'll close by asking about your expectations for the new ""Star Wars"" movie. I have no idea! Have you seen the trailer? I watched it over someone’s shoulder on their iPhone. I didn’t watch it properly. I’ve got no feelings about it at all. I’m looking forward to seeing it, I suppose, as much as the next man.Is it a relief not to have to concern yourself with how people will react to the new movies? I never bothered about what they felt about mine anyway, so I don’t have that feeling. I’ll enjoy watching it as a filmgoer as much as anyone else, I’m sure. I’m interested to see what the storylines are. I never talked about it with George Lucas. I knew there were three other chapters, but I never asked him what they were. So I know as much about it as you do. "

Um, right? There are a lot of people who would rather get a good spanking than a box of chocolates for Valentine's Day and I'm all for that. The problem I have with Fifty Shades of Grey is that it's BDSM for Dummies, it's BDSM Lite. (I don't want to jump on the bandwagon with those who call it ""Mommy Porn,"" because I think mommies deserve good porn as much as anyone else.)The book sold over 100 million copies worldwide, proof that the people who bought it -- mostly women -- are turned on and intrigued by the power dynamics involved in BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadomasochism.) That's a great thing! And the book does open up a forum for discussion of BDSM within mainstream conversation, BUT it isn't really about BDSM. It's just a bad Harlequin romance novel that reinforces antifeminist stereotypes of gender in a conventional and conservative story between a controlling man and an amenable girl. Don't get me wrong, a good Harlequin romance can provide strong female role models, hot fantasy scenarios or romantic escapism, but Fifty Shades is more than a few shades short of that.For those of you who haven't yet endured the punishment of reading the book, I'll save you some time. Our protagonist, Anastasia Steele, is a naive college student with an elementary school vocabulary who falls for Christian Grey, a rich asshole with amazing hair and blazing eyes. Grey is a control freak who says that if she wants him to be her boyfriend she has to sign a contract where she agrees to eat what he says, exercise when he says and dress as he commands. She must also live under the constant threat of pain as punishment, and be sexually available to him at all times. I know... a couple of red flags. But did I mention the amazing hair? Meanwhile, Anastasia just wants a vanilla (conventional) relationship, with maybe a touch of naughtiness. Then there is chapter after chapter of eye-rolling and lip-biting and holy cows and by the end of book neither Grey or Steele get what they want. I only know that by the time I finished it, I wanted to punch this book in the face.Fifty Shades doesn't explore BDSM as a potentially meaningful, consensual sexual practice to the individual or collective female experience. Rather, the book keeps the taboo in kink with the misconception that a person must be really messed up (abused) to explore this erotic practice. It also doesn't explore the beauty and the power of submission, nor does it touch on the harder elements of BDSM play.True BDSM is a consensual role-play experience where both parties negotiate and agree to act out specific erotic desires in a safe context. There are a variety of activities, fantasies, and fetishes that are explored, but there are specific rules in place to keep things safe, sane, and consensual, or risk aware. And unlike Fifty Shades, real BDSM can be very, very fun.  However, Fifty Shades of Grey has some value for me as a domme. I currently use the book in sessions as a torture device. Very bad slaves have to read the book aloud and act out scenes. One of my slaves pleaded for me to stop the pain, offering to receive 100 strokes of the cane if he could just stop reading. Another used his safe word and willingly gave up a year's salary to me to ""end this horrific task."" So, my inner goddess thanks you, E.L. James, for 500 pages of pure torment.   Fifty Shades of Grey doesn't offer a glimpse into the authentic world of BDSM, which is more beautiful and disturbing than anything portrayed in the book. We'll see if the film offers any more insight into what I know is a complex and fascinating world. But you'd have to tie me up to make me sit through it.__Mistress Trinity works as a professional dominatrix in Los Angeles. She has a Master's degree in Philosophy and her academic work focused on a woman's ability to consent to violence in a sexual context.

6,EDUCATION,Progressive Labels for Regressive Practices: How Key Terms in Education Have Been Co-opted,"Alfie Kohn, ContributorEducation expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-labels-for-re_b_6586622.html,"A number of labels that originally signified progressive ideas continue to be (mis)appropriated, their radical potential drained away, with the result that they're now invoked by supporters of ""bunch o' facts"" teaching or a corporate-styled, standards-and-testing model of school reform.",2015-02-02,"Andrew Zhu, right, smiles while using his iPad for a lesson as first grade teacher Jan Sabin helps Hayden Putz, left, with her work on Friday, Jan. 16, 2015, at Walden Elementary School in Deerfield, Ill.

Until it was brought down by furious attacks from social conservatives, academic behaviorists, and others, many teachers were intrigued by this alternative to the phonics fetish and basal boom that defined the field. More than just an instructional technique, WL amounted to a declaration of independence from packaged reading programs. So how did the publishers of those programs respond? Some ""absorbed the surface [features] of WL and sold them back to teachers."" Others just claimed that whatever was already in their commercial materials -- bite-size chunks of literature and prefabricated lesson plans -- was whole language.Until you can beat them, pretend to join them: WL is literally a textbook illustration of that strategy. But it's hardly the only one. For example, experts talk about the importance of having kids do science rather than just learning about it, so many companies now sell kits for easy experimenting. It's branded as ""discovery learning,"" except that much of the discovery has been done ahead of time.A teacher-educator friend of mine, a leading student of constructivism, was once treated to dinner by a textbook publisher who sought his counsel about how kids can play an active role in the classroom and create meaning around scientific ideas. The publisher listened avidly, taking careful notes, which my friend found enormously gratifying until he suddenly realized that the publisher's objective was just to appropriate key phrases that could be used in the company's marketing materials and as chapter headings in its existing textbook.Or consider cooperative learning. Having students spend much of their classroom time in pairs or small groups is a radical notion: Learning becomes a process of exchanging and reflecting on ideas with peers and planning projects together. When we learn with and from one another, schooling is about us, not just about me. But no sooner had the idea begun to catch on (in the 1980s) than it was diluted, reduced to a gimmick for enlivening a comfortably traditional curriculum. Teachers were told, in effect, that they didn't have to question their underlying model of learning; Students would memorize facts and practice skills more efficiently if they did it in groups. Some writers even recommended using grades, certificates, and elaborate point systems to reinforce students for cooperating appropriately.In short, the practice of ""co-opting"" potentially transformative movements in education is nothing new. Neither, however, is it just a historical artifact. A number of labels that originally signified progressive ideas continue to be (mis)appropriated, their radical potential drained away, with the result that they're now invoked by supporters of ""bunch o' facts"" teaching or a corporate-styled, standards-and-testing model of school reform.A sample:* Engaging doesn't denote a specific pedagogical approach; it's used as a general honorific, signifying a curriculum that the students themselves experience as worthwhile. But these days the word is often applied to tasks that may not be particularly interesting to most kids and that they had no role in choosing. In fact, the value of the tasks may simply be ignored, so we hear about student ""engagement,"" which seems to mean nothing more than prompt or sustained compliance. Such children have internalized the adults' agenda and are (extrinsically) motivated to complete the assignment, whatever it is. If the point is to get them to stay ""on task,"" we're spared having to think about what the task is -- or who gets to decide -- even as we talk earnestly about the value of having engaged students.* Developmental originally meant taking our cue from what children of a given age are capable of doing. But for some time now, the word has come to imply something rather different: letting children move at their own pace . . . up an adult-constructed ladder. Kids may have nothing to say about what, whether, or why -- only about when. (This is similar to the idea of ""mastery learning"" -- a phrase that hasn't really been co-opted because it was never particularly progressive to begin with. Oddly, though, it's still brandished proudly by people who seem to think it represents a forward-thinking approach to education.)* Differentiated, individualized, or personalized learning all emerge from what would seem a perfectly reasonable premise: Kids have very different needs and interests, so we should think twice about making all of them do the same thing, let alone do it in the same way. But there's a big difference between working with each student to create projects that reflect his or her preferences and strengths, on the one hand, and merely adjusting the difficulty level of skills-based exercises based on students' test scores, on the other. The latter version has become more popular in recent years, driven in part by troubling programs such as ""mass customized learning"" and by technology companies that peddle ""individualized digital learning"" products. (In a future essay I'll have more to say about the differences between authentic personal learning and what might be called Personalized Learning, Inc.)* Formative assessment was supposed to be the good kind -- gauging students' success while they're still learning rather than evaluating them for the purpose of rating or ranking when it's too late to make changes. But the concept ""has been taken over -- hijacked -- by commercial test publishers and is used instead to refer to formal testing systems,"" says assessment expert Lorrie Shepard. Basically, an endless succession of crappy ""benchmark"" standardized tests -- intended to refine preparation for the high-stakes tests that follow -- are euphemistically described as ""formative assessment."" Too often, in other words, the goal is just to see how well students will do on another test, not to provide feedback that will help them think deeply about questions that intrigue them. (The same is true of the phrase ""assessment for learning,"" which sounds nice but means little until we've asked ""Learning what?"") The odds of an intellectually valuable outcome are slim to begin with if we're relying on a test rather than on authentic forms of assessment.* A reminder to focus on the learning, not just the teaching seems refreshing and enlightened. After all, our actions as educators don't matter nearly as much as how kids experience those actions. The best teachers (and parents) continually try to see what they do through the eyes of those to whom it's done. But at some point I had the queasy realization that lots of consultants and administrators who insist that learning is more important than teaching actually have adopted a behaviorist version of learning, with an emphasis on discrete skills measured by test scores.You see the pattern here. We need to ask what kids are being given to do, and to what end, and within what broader model of learning, and as decided by whom. If we allow ourselves to be distracted from those questions, then even labels with a proud progressive history can be co-opted to the point that they no longer provide reassurance about the practice to which the label refers.Notes:1. These two accounts were offered by literacy specialists Pat Shannon and Harvey (Smokey) Daniels, respectively. See Paula Wolfe and Leslie Poynor, ""Politics and the Pendulum,"" Educational Researcher, January-February 2001, p. 17; and Daniels, ""Whole Language: What's the Fuss?"", Rethinking Schools, Winter 1993, p. 4.2. For more on variations of cooperative learning, see Alfie Kohn, No Contest: The Case Against Competition, rev. ed. (Houghton Mifflin, 1992), chap. 10.3. In fact, the idea isn't limited to schools, nor did it start there. Co-opting is an age-old strategy to weaken movements that attempt to challenge existing power structures, thereby avoiding the need for heavy-handed responses that might end up strengthening those movements. Thus, rather than firing potentially rebellious workers, executives may promote them to managerial positions on the theory that someone will hesitate to oppose a system in which he or she now plays a privileged role. Similarly, oil and coal companies may avoid publicly attacking environmental activists, preferring to insist that they (the companies) support the same goals by strategically funding green organizations or adopting an earth-friendly vocabulary to describe their fossil-fuel initiatives.4. The strategic use (and abuse) of words to further a political agenda -- and blunt efforts to make change -- also has a long history. George Orwell wrote the book on this: 1984. For a more recent example, consider how the term reform has been adopted by those on the right. ""For my money,"" advised conservative columnist David Brooks, ""the best organizing principle for Republicans centers on the word 'reform,'"" which can give the impression that they want to ""promote change, while Democrats remain the churlish defenders of the status quo (""Running on Reform,"" New York Times, January 3, 2004). I discussed the uses to which that word has been put within the field of education in ""Test Today, Privatize Tomorrow,"" Phi Delta Kappan, April 2004; available at http://ow.ly/IgwWS. So, too, for the word choice, which was adopted as a euphemism for school vouchers after that particular strategy for undermining public education was decisively rejected by voters in several states.5. One caveat here: Even in its original, uncorrupted sense, engagement doesn't capture everything needed to create the ideal learning environment. As Susan Engel has observed, even when students are ""quite engaged in a discussion or activity,"" it may still be a teacher-directed lesson that excludes them from ""asking questions or having a chance to pursue those questions."" (""Children's Need to Know: Curiosity in Schools,"" Harvard Educational Review 81 [2011]: 641-42.)6. Mastery learning is associated with the work of Benjamin Bloom and is firmly rooted in a behaviorist paradigm: Tasks (sometimes of little intrinsic value) are broken down into small ""units,"" which students -- not unlike lab animals -- must perform in sequence, with continuous monitoring, frequent evaluation, and, often, positive reinforcement for pleasing the person with the power. This is the polar opposite of constructivist or progressive education. ""Children are expected to progress from one meaningless chunk of learning to another,"" as Frank Smith described the idea. Deborah Meier offered a different observation about ""mastery,"" pointing out that it's an odd word because it sets the bar so high. Few of us can claim to have truly mastered what we struggle to get better at, so either the word has to be watered down or else we teach the sort of trivial skills that can be mastered (personal communication, January 2015).7. See, for example, Maja Wilson, ""Personalization: It's Anything But Personal,"" Educational Leadership, March 2014: 73-77.8. Lorrie Shepard is quoted in W. James Popham, ""Phony Formative Assessments: Buyer Beware,"" Educational Leadership, November 2006, p. 86.9. See my essay ""Why the Best Teachers Don't Give Tests,"" October 30, 2014, available at http://ow.ly/Igx5i. And here's another concern: A wide body of research has shown that when students are led to focus disproportionately on how well they're doing, they tend to become less immersed in, and thoughtful about, what they're doing. As two eminent scholars put it, ""An overemphasis on assessment can actually undermine the pursuit of excellence"" -- and that may be particularly true of the formative kind due to its salience during the learning process. (The quotation is from Martin L. Maehr and Carol Midgley, Transforming School Cultures [Westview, 1996], p. 7. For more on the distinction between a focus on performance [achievement] and a focus on learning, see my book The Schools Our Children Deserve [Houghton Mifflin, 1999], chap. 2.)"

In a misguided attempt to reduce sexual assault, 16 sorority leaders instituted a ban, barring members of their UVA chapters from attending ""Boys' Bid Night"" fraternity parties on Saturday, and threatening sanctions if the ban was contravened. The prohibition triggered pushback from sorority members who argued that the ban encroached upon their right to act as autonomous agents. The move has also been criticized for how closely it echoes antiquated university policies, such as gender-based curfews and residential housing restrictions -- strategies which were gradually cycled out in the 1960s and 1970s.   In a stream of seemingly internalized misogyny, Dash offered this take:I just think it's ridiculous, and I think it's a good thing for the good girls -- women, ok, sorry -- to be told, 'Stay home. Be safe.' The other bad girls -- bad women -- or the ones who like to be naughty might go out and play and get hurt.To be clear, semantics matter. Dash's reflexive use of the word ""girls"" may be written off as a Freudian slip, but as we know, these parapraxes might reveal subconscious thoughts and beliefs. And Dash's point to a toxic, albeit subliminal, phenomenon: the infantilization of adult women. It is the conflation of femininity with childlikeness that subtly furthers the narrative that women are lesser entities -- bodies to be dominated. This social programming supports our culture's gendered hierarchy, reinforcing the primacy of men in a dangerous power matrix. But it doesn't end there. According to Dash, there is also a hierarchy among women, between the ""good girls"" and the ""bad"" or ""naughty"" ones. But this is a false divide -- a schism borne out of the tension between pervasive rape culture and desperation. The lie undergirding this misogynistic line of reasoning goes something like this: If you are a ""good girl,"" then you have nothing to fear. Nice Guys will care for you, and the universe will reward you for being a respectable damsel. You will be spared. Conversely, if you are a ""bad girl,"" you will, inevitably, suffer the consequences. The truth is that the good girl/bad girl trope suffers from the same fatal flaw that respectability politics do: It wrongly assumes that violations of personhood are provoked by the individual being attacked. It works to challenge the virtue, decisions and humanity of the victim and justify the trauma sustained, effectively shaming the person for ""bringing it upon themselves."" Because how dare women leave their home at night and go to a party and (gasp) drink?! At least that's what Dash seems to think: And then the other thing about this is it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over drinks. So, you know, it's like the same thing with guns. Guns don't kill people. People kill people. Alcohol doesn't get you drunk. You get yourself drunk.Notwithstanding, the false equivalency between consenting to drink and consenting to assault let us pretend that controlling for such factors is possible. By that logic, we should ban women from attending university. Or, maybe, bar them from seeing male friends or relatives, since they are more likely to be assaulted by someone they know. Perhaps women should not go out at all. Of course, I'm being facetious. I'm just curious as to why victims are always expected to modify their behavior in hopes of deflecting abuse from a society that devalues them anyway. Why are we not working to change our cultural ethos? How many times must pundits scream ""teach men not to rape,"" only to debate the same futile prevention tactics? And for the black community, specifically, how long are we going to ignore the parallels between rape culture and state-sanctioned violence? When will we acknowledge that ""she was asking for it,"" sounds eerily similar to ""he should've pulled up his pants?""When will we collectively stop being clueless?"

""That's not about politics.""The president also pushed back on Guthrie's suggestion that he should have been more conciliatory towards Republicans.""Republicans believe that we should be rebuilding our infrastructure. The question is how do we pay for it? That's a negotiation we should have,"" Obama said. ""My job is to present the right ideas, and if Republicans think they've got a better set of ideas, they should present them.""""But my job is not to trim my sails and not tell the American people what we should be doing,"" he added.Obama said that clearly communicating his policies and goals -- something he has been criticized for failing to do in the past -- would help him in the final years of his presidency.""One of the things I've learned over the last six years is that when I tell the American people what direction I think the country should go in, sometimes people change their minds, and even Republicans occasionally start agreeing with me, although sometimes a little bit later than I would like,"" he said.That hope for reconciliation will be put to the test on Monday, when Obama is set to unveil his budget for the next fiscal year. The proposal will reportedly include a new tax on corporate wealth amassed overseas as a way to pay for infrastructure upgrades. The budget is also set to commit $200 billion to improving child care in the United States.Obama said that in the last two years of his presidency, he would like to make sure that all Americans benefit from a growing economy.

As he comes to the end of his time in office, he’s trying for one more -- although very few people in Washington seem to have noticed, and the most important steps will probably take place after he’s left the White House.  Obama’s goal is to transform government policies for early childhood. Two weeks ago, Obama sketched out his agenda during the State of the Union address, calling for a series of programs including “universal childcare,” as well as paid family and medical leave for working parents. On Monday, Obama will translate these words into specific requests for action when the administration formally releases its budget proposal for the next 10 years.  The phrase “universal childcare” is a bit misleading, since nobody is talking about creating a vast new government program to give every American child day care. But Obama’s budget will call for a set of targeted tax breaks and spending initiatives for working families that would represent a commitment of more than $200 billion over 10 years, according to sources familiar with the budget document. (The total would be even more if you include a separate tax cut for families with two working adults, although that particular break won’t be limited to families with children.)“We haven’t seen anything like this -- it’s big and it’s bold,” says Heather Boushey, executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning economic think tank. Kris Perry, executive director of the early education advocacy program First Five Years Fund, agrees. “The latest proposal on child care has the potential to significantly influence economic policies and priorities in the next Congress,” she says.  Obama’s interest in the needs of working parents with young children is neither new nor particularly secret. He and his advisers have spoken frequently about parents who struggle with the costs of child care -- and about research suggesting that children who get sustained, nurturing care are more likely to lead healthier, more productive lives. They’ve also pointed to research about the changing nature of the economy -- in particular, the rising number of women in the workforce and the demand for support it has created. In so doing, they’ve echoed the arguments of advocates and scholars who for years have said the U.S. lags behind other countries in adapting to this seismic change in family and work life.  “The research on early childhood investments is clear -- the returns are large, particularly if you include the gain in earnings for kids after they grow up,” Betsey Stevenson of White House Council of Economic Advisers told The Huffington Post earlier this week. “This agenda would go a long way towards making sure our policies catch up with where the economy has gone, and it’s an agenda that is more than the sum of the parts because they all work together.” A chart on labor force participation rate by gender, via the White House  One reason Obama’s early childhood agenda hasn’t gotten a huge amount of attention is that he’s laid it out piecemeal -- starting in 2013 just after the presidential election, when he called for a “universal pre-kindergarten” plan. Under that proposal, the federal government would provide matching funds to states that set up programs to provide 3- and 4-year-olds with day care, while teaching children the basic learning and social skills they’ll need in grade school.  The budget that becomes public on Monday will include a version of this pre-K initiative -- and then place it alongside some new proposals that target infants and toddlers. Among these will be a call to increase the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), a break that lets parents claim a portion of their child care expenses on their tax returns. Today, the maximum credit is about $1,000 per child for up to two children, and most families can’t claim that much because the value varies on income. Obama’s proposal would triple the allowance and let more families claim it -- which, combined with the streamlining of some other tax breaks, would represent a net cost of about $50 billion over 10 years, according to sources.  The outlines of the tax break proposal got some attention last week during a “60 Minutes” interview, when House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated it was the one item on Obama’s agenda they could imagine passing in some form. But the Obama budget will include another major proposal that’s gotten virtually no attention -- a huge boost to the Child Care and Development Fund. The CCDF, as it’s known, provides states with matching funds so that they can offer partially or fully subsidized day care to working parents who can’t pay for it on their own.  Today in most states, demand for subsidized day care exceeds the supply. Low-income parents must wait on long lists and, in many cases, they get no assistance at all. The administration would pump $80 billion into the subsidized child care program over 10 years -- enough, in theory, to boost eventual annual enrollment from 1.6 million to 2.6 million. According to administration officials, reaching that goal would mean child care was available to all families with a household income of less than 200 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $40,000 a year for a family of three.  Obama’s early childhood agenda has other elements, including paid sick leave and a push to make sure child care is both safe and nurturing. The quality of child care services in the U.S. varies enormously, and at its worst can leave very young children in highly unsafe environments. Last year, in a rare show of bipartisanship, Congress introduced new quality standards when it reauthorized the existing program for child care subsidies. (Under the new standards, for example, caregivers are supposed to get criminal background checks and receive training on how to avoid sudden infant death syndrome.) The administration’s budget would allocate extra money for states that want to find ways of attracting better-qualified caregivers, or to help parents who work non-traditional hours and as a result struggle to find available care. It would also renew funding (now set to expire) for a small but widely hailed “home visiting” program that helps teach new parents basic skills while putting them in touch with needed social services.  Nobody expects this entire agenda to sail through Congress, at least while it’s under unified Republican control. The specifics of Obama’s proposals would raise plenty of serious and substantive objections -- and not just because they represent a significant financial commitment. Already, some conservatives have criticized Obama’s child care proposal because they say it slights stay-at-home parents.  But some efforts at improving early childhood policy have attracted strong bipartisan support in the past, particularly at the state level -- where, for instance, Georgia and Oklahoma pioneered universal pre-K. “There are a lot of ideas here that states will be able to push forward, even if there’s no action at the federal level,” says Boushey.  Even in Washington, some early childhood initiatives have found Republican champions -- among them, Republican Charles Grassley, now chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has been an outspoken advocate for the home visiting program. “The current proposal may not pass as it’s written, but there are elements of these policies that have significant bipartisan appeal,” says Perry, “and it’s realistic to think that a piece of these proposals could find their way into legislation over the next two years.”  Obama is also trying to start a conversation that can carry over into the 2016 presidential election -- and beyond. “We should hope Congress figures these issues out and passes these pieces of legislation,” says Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. “But social policy change often happens over years, not months; that's why it's important that the president shows not only where he stands, but where the Democratic Party stands in order to build support over time.”"

Of the big four U.S. sports -- American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey -- the NFL is by far the biggest moneymaker. It boasts packed stadiums, healthy merchandising sales, and a TV viewership almost singlehandedly keeping network television alive. The reason behind the NFL's success is as American as an asbestos class action lawsuit: competition. Simply put, the NFL is the most exciting, competitive league in the U.S. On Any Given Sunday, any team (with the exception of the New York Jets of course) is capable of causing an upset. The NFL has achieved this by leveling the playing field through a progressive system of centralized control that would fill a Politburo apparatchik with pride. A combination of salary caps and the annual college draft -- where the weakest teams, each according to their need, get first dibs on the best young players -- has created a highly lucrative ""product"" for the league and a highly competitive league for fans. Nine different teams have won the Super Bowl in the last 10 years. Equality can equal profitability; the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. This level playing field between the teams is helped by the nature of the game itself: ""buying"" success in American Football is difficult when you have a game-day roster of 46 players. In contrast, success is more easily purchased in basketball and baseball. The Miami Heat only had to acquire three star players in order to create a mini-dynasty, but created one of the most loathed teams in recent history in the process. The New York Yankees' willingness to spend big has also created a successful but often disliked franchise. If the NFL wants a vision of what an unfettered Ayn Rand-inspired league might look like, they need glance no further than across the pond to the English Premier League -- an orgy of high capitalism beloved by Russian oligarchs, Gulf Arab Petro-sheiks, and a number of U.S. billionaires. In England, money is king. The idea that the weakest teams should be given a helping hand because the owner is only worth $ 200 million, as opposed to $20 billion, is laughable. At the end of each season, the weakest teams are not given a hand up, but are instead expelled from the major leagues to a lower division through a relegation process the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes would have found nasty and brutish. In England, the result of an unbridled free market has been a lopsided league. Since 1992, 21 of 22 EPL titles have been won by the Big Four -- Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal -- who regularly buy individual players worth more than other teams. In 2013, Arsenal bought Mesut Özil from Real Madrid for over $60 million (that still makes me laugh), whereas in 1997 an Icelandic consortium bought a 66 percent stake in Stoke City FC for around $10 million. The situation is worse in Spain, where Real Madrid and Barcelona are in a different financial galaxy from the rest of the league. The two teams have won 17 of the last 22 titles. So, when you sit down on Sunday to enjoy the Super Bowl, enjoy a healthy side of irony with your wings. In much of Europe, theoretically a bastion of socialism, football (aka soccer) embraces a rapacious form of capitalism that would make Mitt Romney blush, whereas in the U.S. of A, the NFL eschews the blue and white heat of high finance for a philosophy that is tinged with more than a touch of red.Enjoy."

This was a frequent question among Cubans the morning after Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address. President Obama talked clear and loud: ""This year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.""He seemed confident while delivering the address -- and Cuba was a part of it. During his first term in office, Obama tried to work together with Capitol Hill, but had to face a group of legislators who put their personal interests above the interests of the American people.Now the scene could become more polarized, if possible, considering that Republicans have the majority in both the House and Senate. The Obama Administration is pushing to re-establish full diplomatic relations with Cuba. He eased some regulations, but normal relations between our two countries are not possible while the embargo -- which we call ""blockade"" -- still remains.Unfortunately, lifting the embargo depends on a vote in Congress, and we are aware that any congressional action will take time. Since the December 17th announcement that the countries were exploring relations, we have heard too many extreme positions on that matter. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to Secretary John Kerry regarding Assistant Secretary Roberta Jacobson's visit to Havana last week. ""As the Administration pursues further engagement with Cuba, I urge you to link the pace of changes in U.S. policy to reciprocal action from the Castro regime. The Cuban people, in their continued struggle for democracy and fundamental freedoms, deserve nothing less than our unwavering support,"" he wrote.Another longtime critic of Cuba, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), has shown strong opposition to any change. ""This notion that somehow being able to travel more to Cuba -- to sell more consumer products -- the idea that's going to lead to some democratic opening is absurd,"" he said.The Cuban-American lobby is the only significant ethnic lobby against normal relations between its native country and the United States. This is senseless. Someone asked me one time: ""What could the United States gain by ending the embargo?"" I responded: ""What is the benefit of not ending it?"" That policy has been condemned in the United Nations for more than two decades, and over all, it has not accomplished its goal.""When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new,"" said Obama. ""We are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.""The President's new approach has the support of many congressmen, economic sectors, and most of the American public opinion, as a recent poll proved.A delegation of Democratic legislators visited Cuba since the announcement, led by Sen. Patrick Leahy. ""We want to explore opportunities for greater cooperation and to encourage Cuban officials to address issues of real concern to the American people and to their representatives in Congress,"" he declared.After meeting with Cuban foreign minister Bruno Rodríguez, Leahy talked positively about the trip. ""I think he is open to every single issue -- from trade to communications to establishing relations in agriculture,"" Leahy told reporters, according to Reuters. ""It's not like we're negotiating with countries we've been at war with.""I was born in 1989, at the beginning of a very difficult period of time for Cuba. I grew up as part of a generation that has known nothing but the embargo and confrontation between our countries.But at the same time, we have so much in common. Cuba and the United States have had historical and cultural ties for centuries.Of course, we have serious differences, too. But I strongly believe we can learn how to coexist. We have to. It is the right thing to do. After all, we are neighbors, just separated 90 miles from each other. There are almost two millions Cuban-Americans in the United States. The Miami metropolitan area has more Cubans than anywhere on the planet, after Havana.Complete normalization will take time -- maybe a long time. Meanwhile, if the United States government truly wants to help the Cuban people and ""extend the hand of friendship,"" as President Obama said Tuesday, Congress should do what the Cuban people, and increasingly the American people, have asked for a long time now: lift the embargo.This post is part of a Huffington Post blog series called ""90 Miles: Rethinking the Future of U.S.-Cuba Relations.""

(Photo by William Lovelace/Express/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae05b024000050009650a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among the things for which I'm most grateful to my parents is my fascination with current events, and my vivid connection with the historical occasions that have occurred in my lifetime. This started when I was a very small boy and my mother set up our new television set in the family room while she ironed. In my playpen I would be mesmerized by the Dorsey Brothers, Arthur Godfrey, Miss Frances (""Ding Dong School"") Kate Smith and other entertainers of the early '50s. However, what I remember watching most vividly were the Army-McCarthy hearings in the spring of 1954.My mother and father were Eisenhower Republicans, but they had no affinity for extremists, and they thought that Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin was dangerous and out of control. So virtually from the cradle I was swept up in the political winds of the time, and I've been navigating them ever since.I recall all of this now because we are approaching the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march -- a historical event that is as vivid in my memory as if it had occurred yesterday. Thanks to television, the entire civil rights era is part of my personal history, even though my middle class white family never participated in a demonstration. But we were part of it all. Every American alive in the 1960s was, no matter what position you took. I am proud of my parents' views, and how they guided me.I recently attended a matinee of Selma, the new film by Ava DuVernay about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership in the voting rights effort in Alabama in the winter of 1965. Ms. DuVernay caught it all, including the scenes of horrified white families across the nation watching the brutality of Alabama police wielding clubs, bullwhips, ax handles and teargas to beat back peaceful black demonstrators attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma. In March 1965, I put a map of Alabama on the bulletin board in my bedroom and pressed pins into the spots where the freedom marchers stood. Then on that Sunday afternoon, when they were scattered like so many cats, I pulled the pins out, one by one, and placed every pin in Selma. Downtown. Segregation never made sense to me. In the 1950s, my family traveled through the South several times, almost always by car or train, and the designation of separate public accommodations for whites and blacks seemed unfair and downright stupid. A couple of occasions I recall vividly: In 1956, when I was five, our family drove to visit my aunt, uncle and cousins who had moved to Mobile, Alabama. Once we reached the ""Heart of Dixie,"" as Alabama's license plates used to describe the state, even a five year old stopping at a rest room or at a Stuckey's could see that there were duplicates of most things. Two drinking fountains. Two sets of rest rooms. Even at one Stuckey's two sets of rest rooms and two sets of snack bars. Already puzzled, then outraged, by inequalithy, I decided that I would drink from the ""colored"" fountain. I marched up to it, and stood on tiptoe to get a cool sip. I don't remember how my parents drew me away from it, but they did after I had a long drink, and I recall the steely eyes of people hanging around the cash register watching it all. Why on earth did it matter that this little boy from way up north in Louisville had a sip of water from this fountain? The next summer, we went to New Orleans for a few days and had room service in our hotel, the beautiful Monteleone in the French Quarter. The waiters set up a table with linens in the room, and I innocently asked my mother why all the waiters in New Orleans were black. I was whisked into the next room in the suite and gently but firmly told that it embarrassed the waiters for me to notice their race, and that I wasn't to mention it. I felt a deep shame and have never forgotten it. But I think that much of that shame was a reflection of my basic sense of unfairness. Why should I be served, and why should they serve me?Little children see things more clearly than their elders. They always have, and I expect they always will. Let us move forward through the '50s. My family witnessed the integration of Little Rock schools on television, and watched with pleasure when President Eisenhower ordered troops to keep the students safe. Dr. King came to Louisville and was interviewed by WHAS' top personality of the time, Phyllis Knight, on her daily program, ""Small Talk."" My mother insisted I sit in front of the television and listen to him. ""He is a great man,"" she said. And indeed he was. I can still hear the cadence of his voice, remember the clarity of his eyes, and see the gentle movement of his lips.My experience must have been much the same as other kids in those days. Fortunately, Louisville was a more tolerant city racially than other places further south. We had two newspapers -- The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times -- that preached integration and equality, and by the time I was ten or so, I was reading them both every day. Nothing captured my attention more than the vivid, liberal editorial cartoons by Hugh Haynie. I still believe that his cartoons on race were the best of the time, and were crucial in the nation's change of heart. But the ugliness was all around me. So now we come to 1965. We had gone through the Kennedy Assassination. We had seen the Vietnam War explode. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, with strong Republican Party support (they were still the party of Lincoln), and right wing candidate Barry Goldwater was buried in an historic landslide. It seemed as if the tide truly had turned, and that justice in its most fundamental sense, would be achieved. In 1965 I was a freshman at Seneca High School in Louisville, taking difficult advance-course subjects like Earth Science, English and French. I was still diminutive and a terrible athlete, although I was finding my way as a runner on the track. To this day, I thank the newspapers of Louisville, TV stations like WHAS, the networks of ABC, NBC and most of all CBS, the Sunday New York Times (we could receive it two days late at Readmore Card Shop in Fourth Street - the daily Times wouldn't be available except by mail until 1979), and the sumptuous national magazines (Time, Newsweek, Look, Life and The Saturday Evening Post) for bringing the world into my home and my consciousness.Just a couple events of that winter and spring, 50 years ago, clearly remain in my mind. The first was the struggle over voting rights. I firmly believed that every American had a right to vote and it didn't make any difference if you were black, white, or any other color. I believed it was wrong for the white people to think they were superior to the black people, or the Asians or the Germans (we still had a bit of that left over from World War II). It really doesn't matter what I, a rather nerdy early teenager in Louisville, Ky., believed. The nation was changing, and fortunately, they were believing it too.Dr. King was not a perfect man, and like other great people (President Obama, Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR, John F. Kennedy, Hillary Clinton, Abraham Lincoln, etc.) he had his flaws. But he also had a dream. A perfectly normal dream: That every little child born in this country should have a right to the same opportunities as every other little child born in this country. That was what my parents taught me, and I firmly believed it. I think that it is what Dr. King's parents taught him. And what he and Coretta Scott King told their children. That is what I taught my own children.The days and weeks of early 1965 were truly astonishing. The Alabama police, whose behavior were no less brutal than the Cossacks of Tsarist Russia, were televised for all to see. And their heinous acts were repudiated. They were greeted with screams, tears and covered eyes, in my family's kitchen with pink appliances and Betty Crocker cookbooks, and in the homes of Senators and Congressmen and leaders all across the country. And all of the rest of the people who had pink appliances and Betty Crocker cookbooks.This, I think, is the backdrop of Selma. No, my parents never marched or protested. I was pulled away from a ""colored"" drinking fountain and told not to question the segregated conduct of waiters in the Old South. We stopped eating at the Blue Boar downtown because of the demonstrations, but we faithfully patronized the branches at Gardiner Lane and The Mall, because they were convenient. No demonstrations there.Convenience. The older I grow, the more I think that prejudice of all varieties survives because of convenience. It isn't always painless to deal with bigotry, or neglect, or abuse. It isn't pleasant to watch four darling little girls, full of joy, walk down the stairs of their church on their way to Sunday School, only to be blown into pieces in 1963.No, it's shocking. Stunning to our core. And that is why Selma must be required viewing for everyone, and why the events 50 years ago must be studied, relived, and remembered. For many of you, it's not part of your past. For me, and my generation, it certainly is our past. And it is our present, and the future we must work to change."

The first was, of course, his being gunned down by now former Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson. The second slaying was in some ways just as painful to his family, friends, and the thousands that demanded Wilson be prosecuted. Police officials kicked into high gear with a loud, long, and vicious blame the victim campaign. They held press conferences, leaked documents, and orchestrated a well-oiled press campaign to depict Brown as having gang ties, smoked dope, dealt dope, had an arrest record, was a school troublemaker, and engaged in every kind of deviant behavior. They capped that by waving pictures to the national press that purported to show Brown robbing a convenience store moments before he was gunned down. The brutal inference was he was a bad guy who got what he deserved.They got away with the second slaying by resting it squarely on the ancient, shop worn, but serviceable litany of stereotypes and negative typecasting of young black males. It's the shortest of short steps to think that if Brown could be depicted as a caricature of the terrifying image that much of the public still harbors about young black males, then that image seems real, even more terrifying, and the consequences are just as deadly.The hope was that President Obama's election buried once and for all negative racial typecasting and the perennial threat racial stereotypes posed to the safety and well-being of black males. It did no such thing. Immediately after Obama's election, teams of researchers from several major universities found that many of the old stereotypes about poverty and crime and blacks remained just as frozen in time. The study found that much of the public still perceived those most likely to commit crimes are poor, jobless and black. The study did more than affirm that race and poverty and crime were firmly rammed together in the public mind. It also showed that once the stereotype is planted, it's virtually impossible to root out. That's hardly new either.In 2003 and 2008, Penn State University researchers found that many whites are likely to associate pictures of blacks with violent crime. This was no surprise given the relentless media depictions of young blacks as dysfunctional, dope-peddling, gang bangers and drive-by shooters. The Penn State study found that even when blacks didn't commit a specific crime; whites still misidentified the perpetrator as an African-American. Immediately after the election of Obama the researchers still found public attitudes on crime and race unchanged. The majority of whites still overwhelmingly fingered blacks as the most likely to commit crimes, even when they didn't commit them.The gunning down of unarmed young blacks is not the only lethal consequence of this warped public perception of black males. A Stanford study released days before Brown's killing found that a significant number of whites and non-whites were even more willing to cheer tough sentencing, three strikes laws, and draconian drug busts, when they perceive that the majority of those busted and imprisoned are black. Though no study has yet been done on it, it wouldn't surprise, in the backdrop of the disturbances in Ferguson following Brown's slaying and the mass demonstrations for Black lives Matter that a significant number of Americans would applaud the use of the massive war zone weaponry and tactics against American citizens that were used in Ferguson, as long as those citizens were perceived as young blacks.The Third slaying of Brown was first St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCullough using every legal maneuver under the sun to duck, dodge, and foot drag on convening a grand jury and charging it with determining whether Wilson should be indicted. Next, McCullough deliberately skewed, tainted, mangled, and even falsified, the evidence and testimony to hector the jurors into clearing Wilson. Then, when the inevitable happened, namely a non-indictment of Wilson, he grandstanded before the world to both slander Brown and pretend that his office would cooperate with the Justice Department in its probe. There was even a sickening footnote to this little charade. Wilson was paid a mini-ransom to go on national TV and play act that he, not Brown, was the poor victim of the whole sorry mess. The Justice Department, to no surprise, drew the final curtain down on the Brown tragedy by declining to bring charges against him.Meanwhile, two New York police officers are murdered and that effectively blew the wind out of the sails of a burgeoning forceful movement demanding an end to the police killing of unarmed blacks, such as Brown. The new shout now was it's police lives, not black lives, that matter. The ugly result of all this is that Brown set a hideous standard for dealing with dubious police shootings of young blacks. They can expect to be slain not one, two, but three times.This post is part of the ""28 Black Lives That Matter"" series produced by The Huffington Post for Black History Month.
