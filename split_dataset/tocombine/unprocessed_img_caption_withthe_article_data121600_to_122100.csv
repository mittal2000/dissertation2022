""The clashes lasted three hours and some of them were destroyed - killed or injured. The others escaped.""Jaron, who declined to say how many were killed, said the troops had been tipped off that gunmen were heading to Boguila - about 450 km (280 miles) north of the capital Bangui - and had moved to protect the town. No French soldiers were injured.""The clash was significant. The armed group was extremely aggressive and was looking to take the French position. We called in two fighter jets for support,"" he said. Anti-tank guns and mortars were also used, he said.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Monday it had suspended all but emergency care in CAR to show its ""dismay"" at the government's failure to condemn the killing of 16 people at its clinic in Boguila ten days ago.""It could be the same armed group that committed those acts,"" Jaron said.Seleka leaders stepped down in January under intense international pressure, but the peacekeepers and a weak interim government have failed to stamp their authority on the country, which has seen little but political instability and conflict since independence from France in 1960.Seleka's ten months in power was marked by killings and other rights abuses, prompting the creation of mainly Christian ""anti-balaka"" self-defence militia. About a million people have fled their homes and, according to human rights officials, parts of the country have seen ""religious cleansing"".Underscoring the depth of the crisis, peacekeepers escorted about 1,300 Muslims out of Bangui at the end of April, triggering looting and removing one of the last Muslim groups from the capital, deepening Muslim-Christian divisions.The United Nations has approved a 12,000-strong peacekeeper mission to begin in September, although bringing it to full force is likely to take several months.

1,PARENTS,"I'm a Failure, and You Are Too","Jenny Witte, ContributorFounder and blogger, Mamatoga.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/im-a-failure-and-you-are-too_b_5272644.html,"In a sense, for some of us, motherhood is the one thing in life you will do where you will never feel like such a failure, sometimes on a daily basis.",2014-05-06,2014-05-06-862229_373080389457996_1863655329_nedit.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-06-862229_373080389457996_1863655329_nedit.jpg,"I didn't become a mom the way I thought I would. To be honest, even though I read way too many books on the subject and I do have a grasp of just how babies are actually born, I found myself nearing the end of my first pregnancy pestered by unwelcome thoughts like This baby is going to have to get OUTSIDE of me somehow, and it terrified me. I approached my due date with more fear than I wanted to, even though I was also super-duper ready to not be pregnant anymore. Things went fine at first, and it was only after about 20+ hours of labor that they realized that this was just not going to work the old-fashioned way, and rather hastily I was prepped for an emergency C-section, which was beyond frightening. I had never had surgery, I had never even had laughing gas at the dentist, had never been in an emergency room, nothing even close to this, and it was traumatic, to say the least. But, in the end, my bouncing little baby boy was born healthy and happy, and even though I had a wide and extremely painful scar and a longer recovery than I thought, I was healthy too. I was grateful for that, but I also have to admit I felt like somehow it got ""ruined.""I hated the feeling that things didn't go as planned, and it didn't help when other people expressed that they ""felt bad"" that I had to have a C-section. I felt like I had failed, in a way, and little did I know that was only the first in a long string of ""failures"" as a parent. In a sense, for some of us, motherhood is the one thing in life you will do where you will never feel like such a failure, sometimes on a daily basis. I got past the C-section thing with Finn (mainly because it was the only choice I had given I didn't have a time machine) and was all set to be the best breastfeeding mother that had ever walked the earth (or just mildly successful, either way). Except, I wasn't successful. Like, at all. I had (wrongly) assumed nursing would be super easy and natural and I would totally love it, and you know what? I didn't. I didn't really love it at all, and neither did Finn. So I pumped. Except he didn't like the bottles I had gotten as a gift at my baby shower and spit up everything I tried to feed him. So I frantically Googled ""best baby bottles + spitting up + newborn"" and found the ones I thought would work then paid the extra 20 bucks or so to have them shipped overnight. Except when I went to check on the shipping (yes, I was this crazy about it) they hadn't been sent yet, and I found myself on the phone with a Target customer service representative, actually in tears, when she told me no, the order was still ""processing"" and would ship overnight within two to four days. ""But it didn't say that on the website? Why would I pay for overnight shipping if I knew it would take two to four days to process?!"" I was sobbing now over the phone to this complete stranger who clearly was hating life at the at moment for being the unlucky one to take my call. I pulled it together and wound up getting the bottles someplace else and they worked, but it was another black mark against me, another example that I was in over my head and was already floundering. With the birth of my second child it was more of the same, with a nasty MRSA infection and postpartum depression I didn't just feel like a failure, I felt certain I was a failure. I paid for a lactation consultant to come to the house and help me, and I found myself in tears with a stranger once again, crying to her because I just couldn't get the hang of it and I didn't understand why.My own mother was the one that brought me back down to reality and stopped me from my self-indulgent pity party about how much I was screwing up. She asked me if she thought my son would remember, or care, for that matter, that he was born via C-section and not ""natural"" birth. Um, no. I don't think he would care. Would he care that I sometimes breastfed him, sometimes bottle fed him, and eventually gave him formula? Probably would not have a strong opinion on it, no. Would it affect my kids if other moms were judgmental about the choices I made in my own parenting? No, it would not. So why would I let it affect me? Would it affect them if I worried about it, cried about it, stressed about it, made it a big deal, every time I made one of these ""mistakes""? Yeah, that might start to actually bother them, actually. So I stopped.The thing is, you cannot separate failure and motherhood. You will fail. Guaranteed. There is no question about that. You WILL screw things up. For sure. Even if you raise them on an all sugar-free, gluten-free, organic only whole foods diet, that kid will have soda at some point in their lives. Or a Big Mac. It'll happen. You can breastfeed them till they are old enough to say they'd like a glass of juice thinking that you are boosting their brain power and they will STILL do something stupid at some point in their lives. You can bet on it. And the failures aren't even something you can prevent. You can have a birth plan and a bag packed with a soothing birth songs playlist and be ready to go epidural free and then wind up with it going 100 percent NOT as planned. You can plan things to within an inch of your eyeballs and the failure will creep in. It's built in, and you cannot escape it. The only thing you control is how you handle it, and how big of a deal you make it.There is no one guaranteed formula for being successful as a parent, otherwise we would all be doing it. You try your best, you do what you think is right, and you love them. That's all. None of the other stuff matters AT ALL. Not what cake you make for their first birthday or what their hair looked like in their school pictures. Let these little failures go even without acknowledgement, because they are so miniscule compared to the hugeness of the love a mother has for a child that they are laughable. We as moms get bogged down with these little hurdles and think they add up to a bigger problem, but the truth is, they don't. Your child will not care that you forgot about School Spirit day when they are older, they won't remember if you bottle fed them or breastfed them, they won't care that you forgot to pack their lunch, or their show and tell project. Whether you work outside the home, in the home, or stay at home, teach them to respect everyone's choices, and maybe they will growing up respecting yours. Show them kindness, and they will grow up doing the same. Teach them that it isn't the end of the world if they don't get what they want, and they won't make a big deal when they don't have THAT toy that they asked for under the Christmas tree. Focus on the important stuff, not this silly ""Mom Fail"" stuff, feeling bad and complaining about not finding the right Doc McStuffins toy isn't going to help you be a better parent, nor is judging anyone else for not doing the same stuff you do. And see that's the thing, since none of us are immune to screwing up, you can stop the whole Judgmental Mom thing, because we all screw up. Even you, Pinterest Party Thrower. And you, PTA Supermom, and you ""Natural Birth No Epidural C-Sections Are Horrible"" Mom. You guys screw up just like we all do, so get off your high mom horse and stop pretending like a failure means you are a bad mom.Besides, all experts are pointing to failure being actually good for kids nowadays. They need to fail in order to be successful, and they need to see us fail. They can see us make mistakes and watch how we handle it and move forward and do our best without it being the end of the world. It's our job, therefore, to fail. To show them how it's done. But, before I finish my rallying cry for more failures, let's discuss some things people can stop counting as a ""Mom Fail"" or as a problem when parenting, because these things simply do NOT matter (trust me):• Not being able to secure any Frozen-themed party decorations for your child's birthday party. They will get over it. Let it Go (heavy handed pun intended).• Not feeding your child everything organic. That gets expensive. And every child needs a little processed food once in a while. Cotton candy at the fair. Ice cream from the ice cream man. Loosen up a little bit. Give them some good most of the time if you can, but otherwise, chill out and let the kid have a Happy Meal once in a blue moon. It's called balance. Not that hard. Don't want to budge? Then skip the side eye when you see other parents letting their kid have candy.• Not being a class parent or a secret reader or volunteering at your child's school at any point in time. I work full-time. And I have a small child at home full-time (soon to be two). And no I don't think that means I need to or should take a day off and hire a babysitter so I can do it, either. Get over it.• Any of your nighttime routines or rituals. Maybe it takes you an hour or longer to get your kid into bed, maybe you have to nurse them to sleep or rock them or read to them or you let them cry it out or they still sleep in your own bed. Whatever you feel comfortable with and gets that kid to sleep is fine.• If you didn't or don't make your own baby food. Have you seen these pouches they have nowadays? Some of them are all organic and have stuff like salba in them which is apparently a superfood that I have never even heard of yet alone have eaten myself. And when your baby or toddler spits it out on the floor you're going to feel better that you bought it at Target rather than peeled, chopped, blended, and somehow put this mystery salba thing into it yourself.• If you yell. Try not to do it all the time of course, but we all do it, even if some of us don't admit to it. My mom yelled once in a while too and I didn't turn out to be an axe murderer.• If your house isn't super clean. As long as your friends and family aren't planning on calling A&E to get you on the next episode of Hoarders, you're in the clear. Laundry piles never killed anyone.• Forgetting to send in snack. I don't even remember if my mom EVER sent in snack, or had to send in a snack, nor do I remember even eating snacks in school. This falls under an ""oops, my bad"" umbrella which can immediately be forgotten.• Letting your kids hear you curse or letting them watch a non-PG rated movie. One of the first movies I ever saw was The Beastmaster at the drive-in with my parents, and I'm pretty sure I was fairly young when I watched Rambo with my older brothers. Again, not an axe murderer. If the worst thing that happens is that your child says f*ck at the grocery store, you're doing just fine.So, accept that you are a failure, based simply on the fact that you are a mom. Let's all pay less attention to just how we are doing this whole parenting thing (and how others are doing it) and more attention to just being in the moment of doing it. Pay more attention to enjoying it, without worrying about the screw ups or what others think of the screw ups. Instead of worrying if your child is disappointed they didn't have any Elsa or Olaf balloons at their party, just enjoy it with them. Instead of staying up late making cupcakes that you think will be perfect, get some sleep and send them in with some store boughts that will please everyone regardless. After all, thinking that these mistakes have any impact at all is the real #MomFail anyway."

(AP Photo/Elizabeth Dalziel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc135af2300005000d0ac9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sui-Lee WeeBEIJING, May 6 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday detained five rights activists, three lawyers and a rights group said, after they attended a weekend meeting that called for a probe into the suppression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.Among those held was Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent free-speech lawyer, who has represented many dissidents, including artist Ai Weiwei and an activist of the ""New Citizens' Movement"", a group that urges Chinese leaders to disclose their assets. He was detained on a charge of ""causing a disturbance"", two lawyers said.He has also opposed the system of forced labour camps, which the government has abolished, and featured prominently in state media for that campaign - unusual for a government critic.Also detained were dissident Liu Di and Xu Youyu, a professor with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank, rights lawyer Shang Baojun said, citing conversations he had with family members of Liu and Xu.Shang said he did not know what charge Liu and Xu would face as the families have not received their detention notices.Dissident Hu Shigen and Hao Jian, who teaches at the Beijing Film Academy, were also detained, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a China-based rights advocacy group.The detentions raised the stakes in a crackdown on dissent and underscored the sensitivity of Chinese leaders to criticism ahead of the 25th anniversary of the crushing of demonstrations around Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 4, 1989.""Pu is very influential and has a following in the mainstream audience,"" said Maya Wang of the New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch.""The detention, as in previous years' house arrest, is meant to, first, put him out of action during this period, but more importantly, it might be a message to deter any others from commemorating the massacre during this important anniversary.""The weekend meeting marked the 1989 crackdown and sought to ""explore its implications and consequences and call for an investigation into the truth of June 4"", said activist Hua Ze.In Pu's detention notice, Beijing police said they had ""criminally detained"" him on a charge of ""causing a disturbance"" and were holding him at the Beijing No.1 Detention Centre.Pu's colleague Xia Lin, and a human rights lawyer, Zhang Sizhi, confirmed the detention, citing a member of Pu's family. Zhang said he could be representing Pu.State security officers had searched Pu's office and home before his disappearance, said rights lawyer Zhang Qingfang.Beijing police and detention centre officials declined to comment. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news briefing she was ""not familiar with the situation"". INTERNET CONDEMNATIONS OF DETENTIONSOn Weibo, China's version of Twitter, the detentions were condemned by hundreds of supporters, which government censors did not appear to be removing immediately.""This is another heavy slap to anyone who harbours any illusions of the so-called 'new Xi-Li governance',"" one microblogger wrote, referring to President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, in office since last year.""As long as you express dissatisfaction with the government's actions, it can be packaged as 'causing a disturbance',"" wrote another.Causing a disturbance appears to be ""a catch-all charge increasingly used to suppress dissent during 'sensitive' events,"" said William Nee of rights group Amnesty International. For the ruling Communist Party, the 1989 demonstrations that clogged Tiananmen Square in Beijing and spread to other cities remain taboo, particularly on their 25th anniversary.The anniversary of the date on which troops shot their way into central Beijing in 1989 has never been publicly marked in mainland China, though every year there are commemorations in Hong Kong.The government has never released a death toll for the crackdown, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand.Xi's administration has intensified pressure on dissent, detaining and jailing activists, clamping down on Internet critics and tightening curbs on journalists in what rights groups call the worst suppression of free expression in recent years.Pu, who participated in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, had vowed to return to Tiananmen Square every anniversary.""For me these visits have also aroused guilt feelings,"" he wrote in a 2006 essay for the New York Review of Books.""The government's pressures to forget June Fourth have caused the day slowly to erode in public memory: each year the Tiananmen Mothers seem more isolated, and the massacre seems more a topic to be avoided in daily conversation.""Our Tiananmen generation is now in middle age; we are in positions where we can make a difference.

""Some of my friends think I am crazy, when they hear that I am touching the iguanas and the crocodiles. But if they were here like me, they would understand, and they would do everything that I am doing."" Image: ""Booms"" cradles a young American crocodile, a threatened animal found during a nighttime search with flashlights in a mangrove lagoon in Portland Bight Protected Area. Booms, who grew up in Kingston, found his calling in the Hellshire Hills. ""It's easier living to me. Entirely. I love being here,"" he says, pausing before adding, ""I hate not being here."" As we sit in the shade of small field station surrounded by limestone forest, a six-foot long, leather-brown iguana ambles towards us, its tail scattering dust as it swings from side to side, and flops onto the floor near our feet.  The Jamaican iguana story is a fascinating one. The largest land animal in Jamaica was long believed to have gone extinct after being last sighted on Goat Islands, two small cays south of Kingston, in 1948. Until 1990, that is, when a hog hunter chanced upon a live iguana in the Hellshire Hills; around 50 survivors of the ""rarest lizard in the world"" were subsequently found to be hanging on. Image: Young Jamaican iguanas are raised in a facility in Kingston to see them through the most vulnerable months before being released back into the wild -- a process known as ""headstarting.""  Following its rediscovery the iguana became a flagship for conservation in the West Indies, and the focus of an international recovery program. A headstart facility was built in Kingston to rear eggs and hatchlings brought from the wild, so that they could be released back into the wild once big enough to ward off predators. The program was a success. Image: The critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Cyclura collie, was described as the ""rarest lizard in the world"" after its rediscovery in 1990. It has become a flagship for conservation in the West Indies and the subject of an international recovery program.A Safe Haven?  The recovery of the Jamaican iguana has been aided by the creation in 1999 of the 187,515 hectare Portland Bight Protected Area, which contains one of the largest dry limestone forests in the Caribbean, the largest intact mangrove forest in the country, and 20 globally threatened species. The area was deemed so special that it was under consideration as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, until last year when the government backtracked on the proposal, signifying an ominous change of plans. The government announced in August that it was engaged in negotiations to sell Goat Islands to the China Harbour Engineering Company to build a massive transshipment port and associated logistics hub, right in the heart of the Portland Bight Protected Area.  Image: A view from the Hellshire Hills of the Portland Bight Protected Area, containing one of the largest dry limestone forests in the Caribbean and the largest intact mangrove forest in the country.Livelihoods Lost  Portland Bight Protected Area is home to a population of 50,000 fishers, whose livelihoods will be devastated by the development. But only the brave in Jamaica dare speak out against the proposed sale of Goat Islands, risking accusations of xenophobia. Dr. Byron Wilson, who has devoted over a decade of his life to protecting the Jamaican iguana and in recent years has jeopardized his academic career at the University of the West Indies by expressing opposition to something that will see more than twenty years of hard work ""go up in smoke."" As we sit on the remote Manatee bay under a full moon, staring into a star-filled sky over the Caribbean he says, ""The plan since the 1970s has been to clear Goat Islands of introduced predators and create a safe haven for threatened native species such as the iguana. That has been the dream. I probably won't want to come back here soon. I just can't stand the thought of sitting here, and hearing dynamite exploding over there,"" he points in the direction of Goat Islands as he talks, ""and seeing plumes of smoke over the horizon. I just can't do it.""Image: Paulette Coley is the only registered fisherwoman in Old Harbour Bay, and an outspoken opponent to the proposed development of Goat Islands for fears of negative impacts to their livelihood.  Joining Wilson in the fight to oppose the development is Dianna McCaulay, founder and CEO of the Jamaica Environmental Trust.

The tourism industry in Jamaica accounts for over 50 percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings, and provides about one-fourth of all jobs in Jamaica.

The Anti-Defamation League posted on its website, Friday, Nov. 12, 2010, that Beck's comments on billionaire financier George Soros and the Holocaust were ""inappropriate, offensive and over the top."" Beck described Soros this week as a ""Jewish boy helping send the Jews to the death camps."" (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c74f200000f90101cdff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While giving a commencement address at Liberty University a week ago, Glenn Beck told the students that he not only had some personal thoughts to deliver, but also a message from God Himself. My first thought was, geez, some people will say anything to get graduating students to listen to their commencement address. But then I considered the source and figured that if anyone had a pipeline directly to the Almighty, it was Glenn Beck.""You tell them I am coming,"" Mr. Beck explained the Lord told him, ""and I will settle scores.""Now, you might think that this admonition from God came as a warning for the students as they were about to embark unto the world. In fact, it was from three years earlier, when Glenn Beck was then preparing to speak in Jerusalem.Maybe it's just the way I was brought up, but if the Lord God Almighty gave me a message to tell others, I might consider passing it along right away. In fact, if God's message was about Him making a visitation to mankind, I'd for sure want to act on it pretty quickly. At the very least, put out the good guest towels and a change of sheets. But Glenn Beck waited three years to let everyone know that God was on His way?? Man, talk about Grade-A procrastinating. Then again, considering his audience -- students who probably spent four years putting off writing papers until the last minute -- they could probably empathize, which is always a good thing with a long speech.I can imagine God, though, waiting around at the Pearly Gates, twiddling His thumbs, tap-tap-taping His foot impatiently, waiting to be announced by Glenn Beck. After all, if Conan O'Brien needs Andy Richter to shout each night, ""And now, here's your host...Coooooo-naaaaaan O'Briiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiannnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!, before he'll come on stage, one can only imagine what the Great Host requires before coming to earth. Making Him wait in the wings for three years doesn't seem like a good thing.And considering that He's coming to settle scores, you'd think that you would really want to be on your very best behavior. You have to figure that God is truly in a pissed off mood to begin with. So, when the Lord gives you a message to deliver -- deliver it, for God's sake.The thing about Glenn Beck's statement to the graduates, however, is that while it seems intended to make the faithful smile in beatific self-righteousness and make the heathen tremble -- he never actually explains whose scores God will be settling.For all we know, God is bothered by false prophets, which is specifically why He warned Glenn Beck. God may have also figured that when He said ""tell them I am coming,"" he selected Glenn Beck because the radio host speaks to his listeners every day and those are the ones who God is after.One thing we can likely be sure of is that if God is coming to settle scores, it would in part be against those who go against His teachings in the Bible. In which case, some of the people who are in deep trouble include --Sons who go against their parents and can be stoned to death. (Deut. 21:18-21)Anybody who has worked on a Sunday should be put to death. In other words, kiss goodbye to the NFL. (Exodus 35:2)Unmarried girls who say they're virgins but aren't can be stoned to death. Two thousand years of first dates down the drain. (Deut. 22:13-21)If you've ever gone against the Lord's Third Commandment and taken God's name in vain, oh, man, you are in serious trouble and are in for a major score settling.If you've ever eaten shellfish, that's an abomination in the Bible, and you have to figure that Biblical abominations are so at the top of the list when it comes to settling scores.By the way, you have to figure that Sarah Palin should start wearing some protective gear as God settles scores, since He can't be too happy about her using baptism to justify torture.Mind you, Glenn Beck is a Mormon, so it's not quite clear why he thinks he's safe from the wrath of God, who might not like Joseph Smith interpreting His words and taking them for his own.Going further though, it's possible that God is pissed off by the hubris of being rewritten period, and therefore everything that comes from the New Testament unauthorized sequel is in for ""false idol"" score settling.Then again, for all I know, God just meant that He's going to come and smite the New York Yankees and Dallas Cowboys. After all, He dealt with the New York Mets years ago. He may just want to update things.In the end though, perhaps this is making it all the more complicated than it really is. Maybe the score that God wanted to settle was students who go to Liberty University, which is why He made them sit through a Glenn Beck commencement address.*To read more from Robert J.

And the risk factors have taken on a new face: race and poverty.,2014-05-05,"An AIDS activist lights a group of candles placed in the shape of a red ribbon during an event marking World Aids Day in Manila on December 1, 2012. Discrimination against homosexuals and people infected with HIV is contributing to the rapid rise of the incurable disease in the Philippines, officials and health activists said. AFP PHOTO/TED ALJIBE (Photo credit should read TED ALJIBE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c24f2100006401c75073.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sometimes, it feels as if the AIDS epidemic must somehow be over. The cause is not as trendy as it once was. There doesn't seem to be the same scale of rallies and demonstrations. We don't hear about in the news: FOX News, CNN, and MSNBC evening news had a combined 19 stories on HIV/AIDS for 2013, and this year there were only two from January through March (FOX News had none). Magic Johnson, who seemingly received a death sentence when diagnosed with HIV in 1991, now looks like he's healthy and could even stand to lose a few pounds (much like myself). And indeed, there has been progress. People with HIV/AIDS are not quickly dying like they used to. In 2012, for the first time since 1983 it wasn't one of the top 10 causes of death in New York City. Even more encouraging, there are about 16 people declared ""functionally cured,"" though you're probably unaware owing to scant coverage in mainstream news media. However, the AIDS epidemic in America is still far too real. And the risk factors have taken on a new face: race and poverty.Although this has been repeated time and time again, AIDS is not just a gay person's disease. While it is true that men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest risk, nevertheless they are a slim majority (57 percent) of people over 13 in America who are HIV positive, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control statistics. If we don't include MSM who also used injection drugs, this majority shrinks to just under 52 percent. A tragic reality is that HIV/AIDS has now become an epidemic among people of color. Although in many circles AIDS may be seen as a ""white person's disease,"" in fact African-Americans are now a plurality of new HIV diagnoses. Of the 49,273 people newly diagnosed with HIV in 2011, 23,168 were black, 10,159 were Latinos of any race, and 13,846 were white. Specific communities of color have also been hit hard: by one estimate, an alarming 1 in 4 African-American men in Harlem are HIV positive, the same prevalence as among Africans in Johannesburg. And the evolution of the epidemic was not that it started among white gay men and more recently spread to blacks. While the first documented cases of AIDS in 1981 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report were five white men, the next two cases were black men. But you wouldn't know it from the early media coverage that generally only showed white men. Tragically, this slanted coverage of the crisis helped perpetuate a sense among blacks that it didn't affect them.Latinos are also at a higher risk for HIV/AIDS. Latino men are about three times as likely as white men to be diagnosed with HIV; for Latina women, four times as likely as white women.The HIV/AIDS epidemic in communities of color goes a long way to explain another reality ignored by the media: although the disease might feel like a New York/California phenomenon, as of 2009 the highest number of adults and adolescents with AIDS is actually in the south, concentrated in poor urban areas with high minority populations. The result is that the rate of persons in California 18-64 who are HIV positive is now lower than those of Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.And while the epidemic is disproportionately affecting people of color, there is an even greater risk factor: poverty. A CDC sampling of selected high poverty areas in the U.S. found that HIV prevalence among heterosexuals was over 20 times more than the overall population, 2.1 percent compared to .1 percent. To put this in perspective, an epidemic is defined as a rate of at least 1 percent. In fact, poverty is such a huge risk factor that there is no statistically significant difference in prevalence rate among different races. Even worse, there is an inverse relationship between income and HIV prevalence, with the rate of among people with an annual income less than $10,000 at 2.8 percent, a rate greater than that of Haiti.There are a number of factors that explain the high rates of HIV/AIDS in impoverished neighborhoods and communities of color. For one, these communities often suffer from a lack of adequate medical care, both for treatment and prevention. And what few health care facilities that do exist may not provide language access for Latinos. Moreover, people who can barely afford necessities won't be able to afford the thousands of dollars for pharmaceuticals and other treatment costs. The high prevalence of drugs also fuels the epidemic in poor communities. Even though intravenous drug use accounts for a relatively small percentage of new HIV infections, those infected can go on to transmit the virus to others through sexual contact. Non-IV drugs like crack also exacerbate the problem by clouding people's judgment and encouraging disinhibited behavior. Someone in poverty suffering from drug addiction might make dangerous choices to afford the habit, such as reusing needles or, particularly for women, trading sexual favors or becoming a sex worker.Communities of color must also grapple with a greater stigma over homosexuality and HIV/AIDS. Religious institutions are often bedrocks of black and Latino communities, and many still preach homophobia. Even heterosexual black men may be afraid of facing the stigma, owing to the news media's baseless claims of a phenomenon of otherwise straight black men who have sex with men ""on the down low."" Black clergy were also reluctant at first to be leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS, feeling that they already had enough issues on their plate, though many have stepped up since then.However, despite all the grim statistics, a solution to the AIDS epidemic is very much in sight, if we only command the necessary resources, have the dedication, and cut through the ideological barriers.For one, we must educate folks young and old. This includes facing the reality that some teenagers will engage in sex, and as such teaching them how to be safer if they do so. Instead, we have endured decades of conservative grandstanding in support of abstinence-only education while the AIDS deaths pile up. The absurdity of abstinence-only education has been exposed more and more over time. A 2007 study commissioned by congress that took 10 years to complete found that young people who received abstinence-only education were just as likely to have sex, had a similar number of partners, and first engaged in sex at about the same age as those who did not receive such education. We've seen Meghan McCain and Bristol Palin acknowledge that abstinence-only education is unrealistic, despite their father and mother respectively running on a presidential ticket supporting it. And when even Pope Benedict has said condoms could be useful to prevent the spread of AIDS, you know that something is out of whack with folks refusing to teach it.And education on HIV/AIDS does not stop after the school years; it must be a lifelong process. This includes the mainstream media doing its part by covering some of the little-known trends I've brought up in this article, instead of sensationalized stereotyping. And if the media won't publicize the realities of today's AIDS epidemic, including the fact that it still exists, then we'll have to do it ourselves.We must also end the ideological barrier preventing the funding of needle exchange programs. This life saving tool gets dirty needles off the streets, and research repeatedly shows it does not increase drug use. All it takes is thinking about it for a few seconds to realize the ludicrousness of a scenario where it encourages drug use. Columbia professor Robert Fullilove does a good job describing what would have to go through the head of a non-drug user: ""Oh, my God, here's a clean syringe; let's go find some heroin so that we can shoot it up."" If anything, these programs can help reduce drug use, since drug users are coming before community activists who can then refer them to help for substance abuse.Eliminating poverty is another key tactic in the fight to end AIDS. That means we must have a decent safety net, including healthcare facilities in poor neighborhoods, so that folks in high poverty areas can afford treatment along with food and rent. One good step in New York State was passage of the rent cap this year so that low income individuals with HIV/AIDS only have to spend at most 30% of their meager incomes toward rent, instead of potentially 70% or more. But there must be affordable housing and other services for all people in poverty, not just those who have contracted the virus. Otherwise there can be a perverse incentive to become HIV positive. As an op-ed in the Amsterdam News put it, ""Is contracting HIV a cure to homelessness?""Passing the Early Treatment for HIV/AIDS Act (ETHA) would also reduce the cost of living for those in poverty with HIV/AIDS. The act would allow low income HIV positive individuals who are asymptomatic to qualify for Medicaid. Currently, people only qualify if they are eligible for SSI, meaning they must be debilitated by full-blown AIDS. Passing ETHA would actually save taxpayer dollars because it would fund preventative treatment to keep the disease from progressing and causing expensive complications. Preventative care would also keep peoples' viral loads low, reducing the chances the virus will spread to others.Tackling the epidemic will also require the community outreach and education. Such grassroots initiatives, which should receive government funding, would help further educate people; combat stigma; promote safer sex and testing; help improve language access; and foster leadership. This will require coalition building among various stakeholders, including community based organizations, non-profits, businesses, and clergy. Celebrities must also help raise awareness, including people of color with whom younger people identify. One celebrity of color who stepped up is Alicia Keyes, who is more relevant to this generation.  Finally, it's going to take all of us being outspoken leaders to end the epidemic. All the funding in the world won't matter if we don't step up to the plate. As Dr. Martin Luther King said, ""Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."" Activist Rosa von Praunheim put it even more succinctly: ""Silence = Death.""There's been too much silence for far too long. Instead, let's be loud and win the War on AIDS."

(AP Photo/Pat Sullivan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c7381f00004002256fdd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'll never forget the moment when I watched a man take his last breath after being executed by the state of Texas. The year was 2000 and Gary Graham lost his last attempt at an appeal/clemency when he was killed before my very eyes. Then-Governor George W. Bush said the sentence should go forward as recommended, despite Graham's insistence that he did not commit murder. Continually proclaiming his innocence, he asked Rev. Jesse Jackson, actress Bianca Jagger and me to witness the execution -- and the three of us did. It's an image that I can never erase from my memory. Some of his final words were: Bianca, keep standing up. Jesse, keep standing up. And Al, keep marching. Watching him die felt inhumane, cruel and just plain wrong. I was reminded of that troubling feeling these last few days when I learned of the botched execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma. It makes me wonder, once again, why we still carry out the death penalty in the most powerful and advanced nation on earth.According to Amnesty International, executions only occur in a small percentage of countries today. The fact that the United States is among this percentage should be disturbing to anyone who believes in the basics of a civilized society. Now, to be clear, I am not commenting on Lockett's guilt or innocence, but I am commenting on the disparity with which justice is carried out. When extensive data exists about the disproportionate manner that blacks and Latinos are profiled, stopped, questioned, frisked and arrested, how can we ever believe the system is fair? When the majority of those executed are also minorities and the poor, do we really think everyone receives equal treatment under the law? And when DNA testing has overturned many convictions, how can we be certain that those that we have executed are truly guilty? When money and status often dictate what kind of legal defense a person will receive, we cannot continue to execute inmates.Recently questioned about Lockett's execution, President Obama stated that it was ""deeply troubling."" I wholeheartedly agree. Witnesses say Lockett was convulsing, moaning and even speaking on the gurney after the new lethal cocktail was administered. According to reports, officials blocked the witnesses' view and 43 minutes after the entire process began, stated that Lockett died from a massive heart attack. This should not be how we function in 2014. If there ever was a time to review capital punishment in this nation, the moment is now. We cannot create a space where such botched executions are allowed to occur.When a majority of the world has eliminated the death penalty all together, why do we still practice it? Why do some states like Texas execute more prisoners than others? And how do we ensure that innocents are not being killed for crimes they did not commit? When the amount of money one has dictates what sort of legal protection he/she can afford, the system will always be flawed. If a person hires a top-notch attorney, chances are they will receive a reduced sentence, or they may even be acquitted. But when a person is represented by a court-appointed legal aid attorney (who is so inundated with multiple cases), do we really believe that justice will be served? Economic disparity and racial disparity greatly impact the way in which the law is applied. And that's a reality nobody can deny. My heart goes out to all the victims of violence and crime, and the families they may leave behind. But while I pray for them, my humanity will not allow me to watch another person die -- especially when we do not know for sure that they are in fact the one who committed the crime. Until we have a full-proof justice system that treats everyone equally under the law, we cannot falsely believe that everyone executed is in fact guilty. The process itself is cruel and in one of the most modern countries on the planet, there is simply no place for it. For even when an execution goes smoothly as planned, it's one of the most vicious things you can ever witness. I know because I speak from experience."
