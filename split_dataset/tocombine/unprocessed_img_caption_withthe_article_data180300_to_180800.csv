She was going through the credit repair process I outlined in The 90 Day Credit Challenge and she had reached the point where she was dealing with creditors on overdue accounts.Unfortunately, this was a psychological brick wall for her. She had a few overdue accounts and she called the first one hoping to work out a payment plan but she felt that she had been railroaded by uncaring debt collection departments of the various lenders she had borrowed from. Her first call ended in tears and any thought of trying to call them back or call the other creditors on the list left her nearly in fits of anxiety.I gave her a pointer that turned out to help her so I thought I'd blog about it in case it might help you too. Instead of calling the creditor and dealing with the embarrassment and frustration of trying to work out a payment plan, start with a smaller goal in mind: Call each creditor that you're trying to work with and ask for a payment history.They will send you a history of your payments, including the dates and the amounts they received from you. You can use this information to help you -- and you just might find that it helps you a lot! Compare the information from your payment history to your bank statements and check stubs. Build up a picture of your payment history with each creditor to see what you really bought, what you really paid, when you paid it, and how the creditor sees your payments.Here are a few things you might find:• Of course, you will see that there were times when a payment was indeed received late or not received at all and they are correctly assessing your account as overdue. But that's not the ONLY reason that an account might be overdue.• Sometimes a payment was sent by you, received by the creditor, but a late fee was charged to your account. So you might have thought that the amount owing was paid off but it really wasn't.• Sometimes a creditor overcharged you, you paid the correct amount but the incorrect amount is still showing as being owed by you. (I've recently seen this happen with a rental car service where the customer declined the extra insurance but the rental car company accidentally charged it anyway).• Sometimes a payment was sent by you but incorrectly entered by the creditor. It happens a lot more than you might realize. They receive the money and maybe someone accidentally credits the wrong account with the money or maybe someone types that you paid ""$1.07"" instead of ""$107.00"". If you can prove that you sent the money in (using your banking information) then they can correct the error. Who knows, you might instantly turn an overdue account into a paid account!With a record of payment history, you just might owe less funds! And even if you still have some outstanding accounts with creditors, you are now armed with knowledge and that is a powerful weapon when dealing with creditors because it helps you to determine what you really owe and just how overdue you really are.My client (who was in tears in my office) used this method to get rid of one overdue account completely and to make payment plans with two others. I'm happy to report, she's well on her way to making HUGE strides in having healthier credit.Please email me your credit questions JeanneKelly@TheCreditOwl.com"

Whether you buy lotto tickets once a day or once a year, the lottery is destroying you because it is insidiously convincing you that the only way you can succeed in life is through luck instead of skill.As income inequality has grown, it's become harder to get ahead. But that doesn't mean you should give up on working hard and developing your skill set. On the contrary, the stakes now are higher: all the more reason why you should devote your time to becoming worthy of high pay for doing meaningful work that improves society.You may fall short of your goals. The world is not a machine that produces guaranteed outcomes. But the worst failure is never trying at all. If you work hard enough, you'll be surprised by how much success builds on itself. Once you have enough momentum, it will be hard not to thrive.Buying a lottery ticket is an admission of defeat. ""Maybe I'll get lucky,"" you say to yourself. But you should really be telling yourself that you will try your best, definitely.As technological innovation and outsourcing replace jobs, the economy is rewarding skill and education more than ever. That's because robots and low-paid work abroad can't replace critical thinking.If you feel stuck, you should consider going back to school or working somewhere that will give you valuable experience. If you already have developed a skill set that's in demand, you should consider using it in a way that will pay off -- like applying for a higher-paying job, writing a book, or starting a new company.Just don't buy a lottery ticket. It's effectively a tax on the poor and the desperate.You have almost no chance of winning the lottery. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot in March, for example, was 1 in 175 million. The odds that you will try your best to achieve your goals, on the other hand, are within your control and can reach 100 percent.Even when people win the lottery, they often go broke because they never planned for a windfall. On the flip side, if you incrementally achieve your goals, you are more likely to win and spend your earnings wisely.It's just like losing weight. People that go on crash diets usually gain back the weight quickly and then some. People that make permanent lifestyle changes, on the other hand, lose weight more slowly but have a significantly better chance of staying thin for life.That's why it's important to make these lifestyle changes: Work hard. Build your skill set. Become more educated. Get to know people in your industry. Find a mentor. And choose a profession that you are passionate about, where you have a good chance of making a good living and succeeding.Get to work and throw away those leftover lottery tickets. They are a string of broken promises from someone that only took advantage of you. Love yourself and make yourself the best person you can be."

It is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, the world's number one killers. Ot her forms of tobacco use include snuff or chewing tobacco.Matthew L. Myers, president of the U.S.-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the study ""underscores the enormity of the global tobacco epidemic"".""Without urgent action, tobacco use will claim 1 billion lives this century,"" he said, urging poorer countries to ""act now and address a crisis they can ill afford."" TOBACCO EPIDEMICUsing data from Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (GATS) carried out between 2008 and 2010, Giovino's team compared patterns of tobacco use and cessation in people aged 15 or older from 14 low- and middle-income countries. They included data from Britain and the United States for comparison.They found disproportionately high rates of smoking among men - at an average 41 percent versus 5 percent in women - and wide variation in smoking prevalence, ranging from about 22 percent of men in Brazil to more than 60 percent in Russia.Rates of female smoking ranged from 0.5 percent in Egypt to almost 25 percent in Poland. Women in Britain and the United States also had high smoking rates, at 21 percent and 16 percent respectively.The study found that around 64 percent of tobacco users smoke manufactured cigarettes, although loose-leaf chewing tobacco and snuff were particularly common in India and Bangladesh.With an estimated 301 million tobacco users, China has more than any other country, closely followed by India with almost 275 million. Other countries included in the study were Bangladesh, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay and Vietnam. The researchers said the rise in tobacco use among young women was of particular concern.In a commentary about the study also published in The Lancet, Jeffrey Koplan from Emory University in the United States and Judith Mackay from the World Lung Foundation in Hong Kong called for more investment in tobacco control measures, saying current under-funding was ""extraordinary"".In low income countries, they said, for every $9,100 received in tobacco taxes, only $1 was spent on tobacco control.The WHO says tobacco already kills around 6 million people a year worldwide, including more than 600,000 non-smokers who die from exposure to second-hand smoke.By 2030, if current trends continue, it predicts tobacco could kill 8 million people a year."
4,TRAVEL,A Different Kind Of Cruise Line,"George Hobica, Contributor

Literally and figuratively.,2012-08-16,"The Azamara Quest is seen docked at the Sandakan Port in Sandakan, in the Malaysian Borneo state of Sabah, on April 2, 2012. A fire-damaged luxury cruise ship carrying hundreds of US, European and Australian passengers arrived at a Malaysian port after engine repairs. The US-based Azamara Quest had been adrift after an engine room blaze March 30. AFP PHOTO/Mohd Rasfan (Photo credit should read MOHD RASFAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c254d2000003000fd754b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Larry Pimentel has seen a lot of water under the bridge. Literally and figuratively.As past CEO of Seabourn, Sea Dream Yacht Club, and Cunard, the veteran travel industry exec has helmed some of the most storied names in cruising. So when Royal Caribbean Cruises lured him out of retirement in 2009 to head its new Azamara Club Cruises brand, he demanded carte blanche to create something the cruise industry hadn't seen before. And he has.How is Azamara different? Three things, really: longer stays in port, more overnight stays and unusual itineraries that include ports that other cruise ships pass by.For example, on a recent 12-night voyage from Edinburgh, Scotland to Southampton, England, the Azamara Journey spent two nights in Dublin and two-and-a-half days in Rouen, France, which it reached by a fascinating six-hour cruise up and down the Seine. On this voyage, the ship stopped at such unlikely, and un-touristy, places as the Orkney Islands and Portree (I had never heard of it either; it's on the Isle of Skye).Needless to say, we were the only ships in port most of the time, which added to the sense of being somewhere special, far from the crowds. To get an idea of some of the unusual ports that Azamara's two ships visit, check out this partial list. I'm embarrassed to say that there are at least 20 that I've never even heard of, let alone visited. The advantage for you, the passenger, is that with these ""longer stay"" itineraries you can spend a night (or two) pub-crawling in Dublin, or do an overnight to Paris even though you've docked in Rouen, just a short train ride away. What fun is visiting a favorite port on a Greek isle or on the Amalfi Coast and not sampling a meal in a buzzed-about local restaurant or hanging out at the town's hot new disco? Whereas the typical cruise ship steams out of town at 5 or 6 p.m., Azamara lingers. And lingers. You might not set sail until midnight. Or 2 a.m. Or you might spend the entire night. By the way, all the other elements of luxury cruising are in place on Azamara. There are two ""specialty"" restaurants, which cost an extra $25 to dine in but are well worth it, plus free wine selections with lunch and dinner. Tips are included. The spa is lovely and the fitness center's equipment is new. And the staff has been well-trained to engage guests with friendly ""good mornings"" and ""good evenings"" when you pass them in the hallways or on deck. I sometimes think that a few guests might get tired of being cheerily greeted each time they encounter a member of the crew on board, especially if they themselves aren't in a cheery mood, but it's a sign of careful training that staff are instructed to greet passengers. Returning to the ship, the security officers seem sincere when they check your key card and say, ""welcome home.""Many of my friends avoid cruising altogether because they think it's not ""destination-immersive"" enough or they don't want to be ""trapped"" onboard. So Azamara might be just the thing for them. I love ""days at sea,"" just looking at the ocean, but it's not for everyone.Why, you might ask, don't all cruise lines spend more time in port? Well, as Pimentel explains, it's pretty simple: when ships are in port, the law requires that casinos and retail outlets on board remain closed. And if guests are boozing it up on shore, they're not visiting the ship's bars or the spa, all of which are revenue centers (in fact, some cruise lines probably lose money on those $350 four-night cruise fares you sometimes see, but make all their profits on these ""extras""). And the more nights in port, the more the ship pays in fees to the port. But after running cruise lines for over 20 years, Pimentel decided the industry needed to be rethought. And it seems to be working.Oh, and one final Azamara distinction: some sailings offer cabins for solo travelers at just a 25% premium over the double-occupancy fare. Most cruise lines charge single passengers 100%, i.e. twice the double-occupancy fare, so that's a huge savings if you're traveling alone."

TapTrak thinks you do. This new micro journal app was developed to simplify how people keep track of the menagerie of numbers and to-do lists that can quickly burden the 21st century mom and dad. With all the recommended time limits and guidelines handed out by pediatricians and experts on screen time,homework, exercise and diet, there is a lot of information a busy parent must keep track of.As a mom of three young children, here are a few of the questions I find myself asking on a daily basis.  How long did the kids spend at the playground?  How much television did the kids watch?  How long did they spend on homework?  Have they been playing that computer game too long?I'm sure you have asked yourself a few of these questions too. Let's face it; many of us are a bit stressed out most of the time and any tool that can help us raise healthy, active, playful kids is one to be appreciated. I have found TapTrak to be one of those products. With a tap, tap, parents can use the timer or stopwatch feature on the app to log outdoor playtime or how long the kids having been practicing the piano. Then this information can be quickly and easily shared on Facebook and Twitter. Did your son or daughter buckle down and swim more laps than ever before or shoot hoops in the driveway far beyond twilight? That sort of diligence is something to be proud of, something that can help inspire other families to return to some of those basic, all-American past times. Most parents want this sort of simplicity and ease in their children's lives, but fear that their kids will fall woefully behind and be unprepared for the future if their schedule isn't full of lessons, sports and heaps of extracurricular activities. I think it's time to re-evaluate some of that over-scheduling. TapTrak is all about simplicity. It isn't one of those fancy, flashy apps that will make you swoon when you open it. No, this is about function, about getting things done. TapTrak helps parents figure out what areas they are doing great in with their families and where they may need improvement. It quickly cuts to the core statistics of life. Parents don't have to guess or worry about if their kids are well-balanced. The counting does the talking. TapTrak can help parents avoid feeling overwhelmed, put the brakes on complicated schedules and begin to really track how much time our families are doing things like walking the dog, washing the car, mowing the grass or eating dinner together. The truth is, our kids need support to become self-reliant individuals raised with plenty of free play time. At Let Children Play we believe that through play, children have the opportunity to discover greatness. Whether it's playing tea party or ninja, figuring out how to fold the laundry or helping to set the table, all of these moments lead our children down a road towards greatness. It's always the simplest moments that have the most impact. So while French lessons may sound appealing, count on the simple things to bring the most joy to a child's life. TapTrak is for inspired moms and dads who are looking to advocate for a back to basics approach to parenting, in which kids are taught to work hard and play hard because, quite simply, that's what counts."

The secret is basically:1. Anytime you have to call customer service because of a grievance (airlines, electronics, utilities, ESPECIALLY for health insurance stuff) you should always keep going past all the robots, record everything in writing once you get to a human (time/date/employee name and number/duration of contact), and eventually get to the highest manager you can.2. Once there: State your experience with the company and demand an extremely large refund/credit/adjustment (if the situation warrants such a thing, which it pretty much always does).3. If that doesn’t work, compile a written record and send it to someone at the company who will give you money to shut you up (generally only worth it if you’re dealing with a $700+ medical bill, in my experience).This works almost every time, and has netted me many airline vouchers and the like. But again, this tactic will eat away at your soul. For example, this conversation with a customer service rep at AT&T, iterated about 12 times, eventually got me $160 off of my AT&T bill. It wasn’t even remotely worth it.Laura: Hello Mr. Jia Tolentino.

If so, you might have to look extra hard to find a budget hotel. These cities are among the most expensive for hotel rates around the globe. Travel services provider Hogg Robinson Group released this week its bi-annual list of the most expensive cities by average hotel room rate. According to the survey, hotel prices seem to be stabilizing as 23 cities showed a rate increase year over year in 2012, compared with 33 cities in 2011. This is the eighth year that Moscow has held the top spot, with rates having increased three percent since last year. Moscow is followed by a surprising locale: Lagos, Nigeria. Its expense is attributed to the high rate of oil industry travel to the country.The survey also found that Latin America leads all regions in hotel rate growth in the first half of 2012, with cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo cracking the top 20. Mexico City, which clocked in at 43, showed the highest increase in room rates at 30 percent. “The results of the hotel survey present an intriguing picture of where businesses are channelling travel spend,"" Stewart Harvey, Group Commercial Director for HRG, said in a press release. ""The significant growth in room rates across the Latin American region indicates a shift in business priorities towards high potential destinations.""Bad news for anyone heading to Latin America, but there's good news for travelers to Europe: Hotel prices in Europe either fell or stayed the same. Which cities have the most expensive hotel rooms? Check out the list in the slideshow below.

The battle to own your digital dollars has been heating up as major technology companies, retailers and payment networks ramp up their mobile payment offerings. Last week, both Google and Starbucks made announcements aimed at growing their programs. Google Wallet is now cloud-based and can be used with multiple credit and debit cards. Starbucks has partnered with Square to create a better way to pay directly from a smartphone.But the rise in mobile payments may not be so good for the budgetary health of consumers who could find themselves spending more as a result, academic research suggests.""With credit cards, people don’t remember how much they have spent and they increase [their spending],"" said Min Zhao, an associate marketing professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. ""That should apply to mobile payments.""There is not much academic research on mobile payments and consumer behavior, since the technology is still only a few years old. Prior research on cash, checks and credit cards, though, has shown that people using credit cards are more likely to make more discretionary purchases because it's easier to ignore the impact on a personal budget.And there are other, less obvious costs associated with mobile payments that add to your bottom line. The cost of a smartphone, data plan and fees, for example, all increase the cost of commerce for consumers.Yet a cashless future is on the horizon. Within the next five years, less than a quarter of of point-of-sale purchases will be made with paper money, according to a recent study from Javelin Strategy & Research.But there may well be a happy medium in the form of instant account balance feedback.Zhao said mobile and electronic payment systems have the opportunity to help consumers' spending habit as much as they hurt it by using instant text messages or other alerts to check their account balance. These alerts could help consumers make a more immediate connection between their spending and their available funds, ultimately leading them to make wiser budgeting choices. Many prepaid card programs and online budget management tools already offer the service.The other part of the equation: Consumers are changing their own expectations. As one Square user told HuffPost Money earlier this year, paying a small transaction fee was worth the convenience of the mobile payment system."

Everyone from The Daily Beast to Politico has devoted space to Ryan’s enthusiasm for the fitness workout regimen, P90X. And, according to a series of articles in Politico last year, Ryan has encouraged colleagues to get in on the interval training system, a 90-day series that relies on a strategy called “muscle confusion” to tone muscle and encourage fat loss. ""Nothing against rock hard abs,” joked Rachel Maddow in a segment devoted to news organizations' enthusiasm for covering the Congressional P90x fad. “I plan to get those after I learn Spanish. But 10 articles [on P90X in Congress] from the premier Beltway news source?”Ryan is hardly the only politician to go public with his fitness preferences. President Barack Obama and the First Lady regularly mention their morning training sessions and pick up basketball games. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were often seen jogging, in what is hardly a modern phenomenon: Theodore Roosevelt trained with a Jiu Jitsu master during his presidency and Gerald Ford -- who turned down offers to play professional football in the NFL after graduating from University of Michigan, where he was an All-American college player -- was known for his skiing, swimming, golf and tennis playing while president. Still, if Ryan’s bid were successful, he may be the first VP to claim devotion to TV fitness. Often thought of as the provenance of busy working parents in suburban living rooms, P90X and other programs like it, have devoted followings, even among those with the resources for personal trainers and home gymnasiums. So what other boldface names love P90X? Read on. "
