0,POLITICS,Why Progressive Groups Have A Problem With Clinton On Social Security,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-social-security_us_56b3f533e4b01d80b245c04e,They are insisting on a red-line pledge not to cut benefits  -- and say her assurances fall short of that.,2016-02-05,"Preserving and expanding the New Deal Program has become a progressive litmus test, but Hillary Clinton will not rule out any and all Social Security benefit cuts. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3f7451f00000d0121760f.jpeg?cache=7V5MxnBO2p&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton refuses to rule out any and all benefit cuts to Social Security, angering leading progressive groups that have not endorsed a candidate in the Democratic primary -- and prompting a new challenge from Bernie Sanders.The issue has arisen as Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her remaining rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, debate who has stronger progressive bona fides and progressive groups call for a red-line pledge not to cut benefits. A Clinton aide instead referred The Huffington Post to the statement on Social Security on the campaign's website, which says the former Secretary of State will ""oppose closing the long-term shortfall on the backs of the middle class, whether through benefit cuts or tax increases.""The aide confirmed that the policy position on the site means she's firmly opposed to benefit cuts. “She has no plans to cut benefits and, in fact, has a plan to expand them,"" the aide said.But Clinton used stronger language to characterize her opposition to privatizing the Department of Veterans Affairs during Thursday's presidential debate with Sanders.""Yes, let's fix the VA, but we will never let it be privatized!"" Clinton said. ""That is a promise.""Sanders has long said he opposes any and all benefit cuts -- and even advanced legislation that would expand the program across the board. The Sanders campaign reiterated that commitment on Wednesday.The dissatisfaction of progressive groups with the Clinton campaign's statements on Social Security have already provided new fodder for the Sanders campaign as the two candidates enter the home stretch ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. Sanders asked Clinton to clarify her position on benefit cuts at a Friday campaign stop in Manchester, New Hampshire.""I ask Secretary Clinton to join me in making it very clear that number one, she will not support any cuts to Social Security,"" Sanders said, according to a New York Times reporter who live-tweeted the event. ""Number two, she will join me in saying that it is imperative that she increase and expand benefits for senior citizens and disabled.""In November, the Senate passed legislation that eliminated some creative (and dubious) strategies retirees used to boost their benefits; Sanders voted for that legislation, which technically precluded future beneficiaries from using a more lucrative benefits claiming strategy, complicating the dispute. What worries advocates, however, is that a Democratic president would use Social Security as a chip in a ""grand bargain"" with Republicans after the election. Clinton pledges on her website to ""expand"" Social Security benefits for ""those who need it most and who are treated unfairly by the current system -- including women who are widows and those who took significant time out of the paid workforce to take care of their children, aging parents, or ailing family members."" Nancy Altman, a co-founder of Social Security Works who has 35 years of experience in the field, said that Clinton campaign's statement and the policy descriptions on her website, do not definitively promise not to cut the program.""What Secretary Clinton has said about Social Security is completely consistent with the Bowles-Simpson plan,"" Altman said, referring to a Fiscal Commission proposal in 2010 that would have made major cuts to middle-class benefits, even as it marginally lifted those of poor beneficiaries. ""From the very beginning, there have been those who have wanted to boost benefits at the low end and cut middle-class benefits -- pushing it in the direction of becoming a kind of welfare program. It is very important that the candidates not only expand benefits but promise not to cut them. Otherwise there could be cuts that undermine what the program is: insurance, where you get a fair benefit for the money paid.""Altman -- who served as senior policy adviser to the bipartisan Greenspan Commission, which recommended the last round of major Social Security reforms in 1983 -- took issue with the notion that in voting to close loopholes, Sanders had given his imprimatur to cuts.""People who really understand the program know that those are not benefit cuts,"" Altman said. ""It was a correction of a mistake that was in the law that inadvertently allowed wealthy people and financial advisers to game the system in a way that was never intended.""The Progressive Campaign Change Committee, a digital advocacy group that claims one million members and has yet to endorse a candidate in the presidential race, was more indignant with the Clinton campaign's statement about its stance on Social Security.""George W. Bush had no plan to invade Iraq,"" said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the group, referring to the Clinton campaign's assurance that she had no ""plans"" to cut benefits. ""It is an absolute must for a Democratic nominee who claims to be progressive to say clearly and unequivocally that they will never cut Social Security benefits. Bernie Sanders has made that commitment. Hillary Clinton should make that commitment before the New Hampshire primary so Democrats can focus on expanding benefits.""The PCCC claimed that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, has taken a firmer stance against cutting Social Security than Clinton had.""People have been paying in for years,"" Trump said in April. ""They're gonna cut Social Security. They're gonna cut Medicare. They're gonna cut Medicaid. I'm the one saying that's saying I'm not gonna do that.""The PCCC has lauded Clinton for promoting debt-free college in the past and says its agenda is economic populism, not the prospects of a particular candidate.Progressive groups began to push Clinton to clarify her position on the program after she nearly tied with Sanders in the Iowa Caucus.Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Campaign Change Commitee, challenged Clinton to ""promise before the New Hampshire primary that she will never cut Social Security,"" in a Feb. 2 appearance on Fox News this week.Later that day, Social Security Works, the convening arm of a coalition of labor union, women's and seniors' groups dedicated to expanding Social Security -- and protecting currently scheduled benefits from any cuts -- issued a statement asking for a commitment from Clinton to do the same.Democracy for America, an online progressive heavyweight that has endorsed Sanders, continued the push for answers from Clinton on Twitter.Protecting Social Security from benefit cuts has become an important test of progressive credibility in recent years, as activist groups and national progressive leaders like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) cast the popular program as a crucial pillar of social insurance and bulwark against income inequality. Clinton endured criticism for demurring in a previous debate as to whether she would ""expand"" the program across the board as Sanders, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D), then a Democratic presidential candidate, proposed.Ryan Grim contributed reporting.This story has been updated to include Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) call for Clinton to pledge not to cut Social Security benefits at a campaign event on Friday.Also on HuffPost:"

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who chair the judiciary committees in each chamber. While reducing some severe sentencing for nonviolent offenders has bipartisan support in both chambers, Goodlatte and Grassley have major differences over a policy known as ""mens rea"" reform, which has been promoted by billionaire Republican donors Charles and David Koch.Goodlatte supports a Koch-backed mens rea policy that would make it impossible for prosecutors to bring cases against a broad swath of what are currently corporate crimes, including gross negligence by CEOs. Grassley has vehemently opposed the plan.The White House confirmed to The Huffington Post that the meeting took place, and said the administration remains firmly opposed to the Goodlatte mens rea legislation. It's not clear on what day the meeting actually occurred.Department of Justice spokesman Peter Carr previously told HuffPost that the House bill ""would create confusion and needless litigation, and significantly weaken, often unintentionally, countless federal statutes,"" including ""those that play an important role in protecting the public welfare... protecting consumers from unsafe food and medicine.""The White House has never met with these two GOP leaders in private on criminal justice reform. The meeting was not posted on the president's public schedule.Ryan Grim contributed reporting.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

2,POLITICS,New Hampshire Was Practically Made For Bernie And (Maybe) Trump,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-primary-independent-voters_us_56b4dfeae4b04f9b57d961b2,The state's contrary voters don't like anything predictable or establishment.,2016-02-05,New Hampshire voters resonate with Bernie Sanders' rage against Wall Street.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b4f8961a00009c01ab21a1.jpeg?cache=MoR1B57cU2&ops=crop_0_74_928_746%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The next pivotal point in American politics is custom-built for protest candidates. That, as much as anything, explains why Sen. Bernie Sanders and scaremongering billionaire Donald Trump are leading in New Hampshire primary polls by wide margins.At the same time, the biggest risk for Sanders and Trump is that the conventional wisdom says they will win. New Hampshire hates to ratify the conventional wisdom.Nowhere else in America is as suspicious of any and all establishments, as dedicated to its own vast array of local officeholders, and as resistant to being told what to do or think by Washington, Wall Street or national media bloviators.All of this is reflected in the shape of government here. New Hampshire has no state income or general sales tax; a weak governorship; a state legislative body with 400 members (fourth largest in the English-speaking world); over 200 cities and towns, many of long lineage; and some 7,000 elected officials in a state with only 1.3 million inhabitants.""Almost every adult here either is or has been or will at some point be elected to something,"" former Gov. John Sununu told me Thursday night in Durham before a debate there. ""They don't like being told what to do by anybody.""That over-caffeinated desire to participate -- and push aside the big boys -- finds perfect expression in the state's first-in-the-nation primary, which takes place next Tuesday. If there are races in both major political parties, as there are this year, more than 500,000 or so voters could turn out in New Hampshire. According to Sununu, the total could be an astounding (by U.S. standards) 70 percent of eligible voters.""This isn't Iowa,"" said Sununu, ""where you've got an intense process but one that relatively few people take part in. Here everybody is part of the primary. This is what we do.""New Hampshirites of both parties are wont to surprise the ""experts"" and often go for ""outsider"" candidates. And they decide late -- often in the last day or two.The state's motto, ""Live Free or Die,"" reads like the voters' rule book. It's easy for people to vote in either the Democratic or the Republican contest, and the largest proportion of voters -- this year about 44 percent -- are ""undeclared,"" meaning they may decide at the last minute not only for whom they'll cast a ballot, but in which party.Indeed, this huge, sloshing tub of unattached voters may be the core fact of the primary. They tend to swim at the last minute to the candidate who can say ""f*** you"" to entrenched power and maintain their ""upset"" brand.Consider the latest Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll: It now shows former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at least narrowing the gap with Sanders, while Sen. Marco Rubio closes in on Trump. New Hampshire locals are so immersed in the primary -- and their influential roles -- that they often engage in ""strategic"" voting. Republican voters might cross over and vote in the Democratic primary for the candidate they think has the least likely chance of winning the White House, and vice versa.Or voters might cast a ballot not for their true favorite but for the candidate in their own party with the best chance of stopping someone else they like even less.That's the main hope right now for Rubio, who is looking to benefit from voters who want to defeat Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz, even if they don't necessarily want Rubio to win in the end either. ""There will be a lot of strategic voting this time,"" Sununu predicts.Among those who have benefited from New Hampshire's independence, either with a primary win or a last-minute surge to respectability, are Vietnam War foe Sen. Eugene McCarthy in 1968, Sen. Gary Hart in 1984, Gov. Bill Clinton (""The Comeback Kid"") in 1992, hard-right anti-free-trader Pat Buchanan in 1996, and Sen. John McCain in 2000. That contrarianism helped Hillary Clinton fight off the trendy, Iowa-launched Barack Obama in 2008.Clinton was also boosted eight years ago by New Hampshire's affection for her husband and the extensive time the two of them had spent in the state. Those factors were supposed to help her this year, too. But she didn't count on the heat-seeking missile from neighboring Vermont.Sanders is leading in New Hampshire because of his single-minded and clearly sincere critique of big money in American politics. His outrage at Wall Street -- he almost quivers with it -- resonates in a small state of small businesses. There are few grandee families here, unlike in New England states to the south such as Massachusetts and Connecticut. (While some of the nation's fanciest prep schools are here, most of the students are not from New Hampshire.)Meanwhile, it's very hard for Hillary to refute accusations that she in particular and the Clintons as an enterprise are beneficiaries of Wall Street money, even if it hasn't dictated their policies.Trump strikes a chord for related reasons. Like Sanders, he doesn't have to take money from Wall Street donors -- not that they'd want to give him any. New Hampshire locals seem to like, or at least tolerate, a billionaire who isn't beholden to any other big shots.And Trump disdains all politicians and calls Washington a sinkhole not only of corruption -- Sanders' mantra -- but of ineptitude. His most common word for them is ""stupid."" The paradox of New Hampshire is that since everybody is elected to something, nobody here has any respect for politicians either. An elected official is just your next-door neighbor who may have screwed you on a tax assessment.Take that attitude and multiply it by a thousand with respect to the federal government. No state in the eastern or northern United States has less regard for Washington's efforts than New Hampshire.""We think for ourselves here,"" Joe McQuaid, editor of the New Hampshire Union Leader, has told me more than once.Of course that doesn't keep McQuaid from trying to tell other New Hampshirites what to think. He writes the conservative paper's editorials and long ago endorsed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.It was a quixotic and un-strategic move. If he had wanted to maximize attention to the paper and, at least in theory, its impact on the primary, he would have waited until now to endorse a candidate.But McQuaid is under no illusions that his word is gospel.There is none in New Hampshire.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe,racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

It’s also true in basketball and baseball.""The size increase isn't equal among positions. According a study published in the Strength and Conditioning Journal in 2015, college and professional linemen have taken on the most weight gain over time.Between 1942 and 2011, the weights of pro linemen increased by 15 to 117 pounds. College offensive and defensive linemen didn't fare much better, with an increased weight range of between 52 and 139 pounds. To put that in perspective, according to the Washington Post, in 1957 there was only one first-year NFL player who weighed 300 pounds or more in the league. In 1986, that number jumped to 10 300-pound rookies. And by 2013, the most recent year cited, there were 93 who weighed in at 300 pounds or more. Shockingly, that last number is actually an improvement from the 132 first-year players who weighed 300 pounds or more in 2011.That size increase also comes at a cost to players' long-term health. One small study, published in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise in 2009, found a strong association between obesity, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in Division 1 college football players. Among all the positions on the field, linemen had the highest risk for both metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.On one hand, the association between carrying extra abdominal weight and obesity-related diseases -- such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome -- is fairly intuitive.""The diseases that you’ll find that these players are at risk for are the same types of diseases you would see in the general population,"" Potteiger said. ""What protects these athletes, at least for the time being while they’re playing, is that they’re also really physically active."" Once they stop playing, however, that relative protection disintegrates. Offensive and defensive lineman who've been conditioned to eat a lot of food and work out daily are suddenly tasked with losing all of that excess weight -- or face serious health consequences. One 2005 study of almost 4,000 players found that lineman are twice as likely to die before age 50 than their teammates. Potteiger thinks the NFL should be doing more for players who are at risk, starting with health screenings for those carrying excess body fat around their midsections. ""They have to be regularly monitored for their blood cholesterol levels and blood pressure,"" he said. ""None of those are really difficult to assess.""Football players also have relatively short careers, on average. According to the NFL Players Association, the average professional football career is 3.3 years, the New York Times reported in 2014. The vast majority of college football players won't make it to the NFL at all -- less than 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted, meaning they're out of the sport even faster.

8,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Has His Own Shadowy Donors -- And They're Nurses,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-super-pac_us_56b40b12e4b08069c7a6bda3,The union super PAC is a bit different from Clinton's group but it's there nonetheless.,2016-02-05,Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders actually is backed by a super PAC.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During Thursday night's Democratic debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) trotted out a variation on a line we've heard from him often on the campaign trail: ""I'm the only candidate up here who doesn't have a super PAC.""As a loud critic of money in politics, Sanders loves to rip super PACs while on the stump. And he's right to suggest that super PACs backing rival Hillary Clinton's candidacy are raising piles of dough right now.But Sanders' bid for the White House also has a super PAC supporting it. It's called National Nurses United for Patient Protection.National Nurses United is a labor union of 185,000 registered nurses known for its progressive politics. It was the first national union to endorse Sanders' campaign for the presidency, though most big unions have lined up behind Clinton. NNU's members have become a fixture at Sanders' rallies in the early primary states, and they canvassed hard for him in Iowa, where he finished neck-and-neck with the presumed front-runner.While NNU's money may not match the most powerful corporate super PACs, it's hardly insignificant cash. As Politico recently reported, the group pulled in $2.3 million in 2015, its largest single-year haul ever. It shelled out $1.3 million during the second half of last year, with $400,000 of it going to other groups that support Sanders.The super PACs that have sprouted up post-Citizens United have let companies spend unlimited amounts of money on political activities. But the rules have allowed labor unions to do just the same. And though unions may be outgunned by corporate America when it comes to raising cash, candidates like Sanders can still benefit from organized labor's super PACs. Clinton's campaign has pounced on Sanders' support from the nurses union, calling it a clear contradiction. In a statement sent out immediately after Sanders made his remarks during Thursday's debate, Clinton's campaign said the senator's claim that he doesn't have a super PAC ""just isn't true.""Sanders, meanwhile, has said he doesn't see any hypocrisy at play.“The difference is a pretty simple difference,” the Vermont independent recently told reporters. “Hillary Clinton goes out raising money for her own super PAC. I don’t have a super PAC, and in the best of all possible worlds, which I hope to bring about, we will get rid of super PACs. We will overturn Citizens United.”In fairness to Sanders, there are differences between a super PAC like that of National Nurses United and one like Priorities USA, a group aligned with Clinton. Most of the money in the nurses super PAC likely comes from the dues that individual workers pay to their union, in small amounts each paycheck. In contrast, 98 percent of the money raised by Priorities USA Action in the second half of 2015 came from donors giving $100,000 or more, as The Huffington Post recently reported. And 90 percent of its money came from donors forking over at least $1 million.Read more updates on the Democratic debate below:"

Rick Snyder speaks to the media regarding the status of the Flint water crisis on Jan. 27 at Flint City Hall in Flint, Michigan. The governor proposed spending $30 million in state funds to offset residents' water bills on Feb. 3.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b28b281a00002d00ab1f92.jpeg?cache=rHQLlKOiup&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder announced a proposal Wednesday that would allocate state money to pay part of Flint residents’ water bills during the ongoing lead contamination crisis. Snyder, a Republican, will make the case for the $30 million plan when he presents his budget next week for the coming fiscal year. Pending the state legislature's approval, his proposal would lower residents’ bills by about 30 percent until water is safe to drink, and credit their past bills going back to April 2014. Former residents would also be eligible for refunds. “I agree with Flint residents, that they should not have to pay for water they cannot drink,” Snyder said in a statement.The city's problems date back to 2014, when it stopped buying pre-treated Lake Huron water from Detroit as a cost-cutting measure. It began using Flint River water without treating it to prevent corrosion, and the water then wore down the system's aged pipes and leached lead from them.In young children, lead exposure can have lifelong effects on health development, and local organizations consider it a public health crisis that could last decades.The city switched back to Detroit's water system, but there is no timeline for when it will be safe to drink from the tap again. In the meantime, bottled water and filters are being distributed to residents for free. All the while, Flint residents have been billed for water that poisoned children. State and federal officials didn’t act on the crisis for months, a failure that has prompted extensive criticism, including from members of Congress at a hearing Wednesday morning. Just because residents could do laundry with the lead-contaminated water, doesn’t mean they should have to pay for it, state Rep. Phil Phelps said. Phelps is a Democrat who represents parts of Flint. ""At the end of the day, people were paying for water,” Phelps said. “That water was destroying their plumbing, and it was destroying their washer, their hot water heater, other items in the house, like dishwashers, and it was destroying the plumbing of the city. Yeah, I think they shouldn’t have to pay anything for the water whatsoever.""Phelps added that he’s ""excited"" that the governor is putting money toward reimbursing residents and hopes that the state will eventually agree to cover the entire water portion of people’s bills. Flint’s average monthly water and sewer bill was $140 in 2014, much higher than neighboring cities, according to the Flint Journal. Under Snyder’s proposal, a family paying $140 would get about a $40 credit. ""This governor has yet to give the people of Flint 100 percent of anything, including leadership and the truth,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Brandon Dillon said in a statement. “The least he could do is refund them every penny they paid for unusable, poison water. Once again, Governor Snyder is showing he cares more about numbers than he does people.""Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech University professor who fought for officials to recognize the lead crisis, said in the statement issued by the governor that the plan was “an amazing gesture of common sense and good will.""Snyder last week appointed Edwards to a committee overseeing long-term solutions for Flint’s water crisis.

11,POLITICS,Panel Says LAPD Killing Of Homeless Man Was OK. You'll Just Have To Trust Them.,Matt Ferner and Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lapd-charly-keunang-shooting-video_us_56b27f4ae4b04f9b57d85eda,Because police aren't releasing body camera video of the shooting.,2016-02-04,A protester last October calls for release of Los Angeles police video of Charly Keunang's death.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b27f9c1f00000d012174ba.jpeg?cache=CLgDtR3d15&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES -- When police killed Charly Keunang, a homeless man, last March, it sparked protests and ignited another round of debate about the Los Angeles Police Department's use of deadly force. A video recorded by a witness to the fatal shooting called into question the official narrative that Keunang had reached for an officer's holstered gun as the two grappled on the ground, leading other nearby officers to open fire.On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Police Commission, a civilian body that oversees the LAPD, moved to put an end to those questions -- without actually answering them. The board agreed with the police account, finding that the actions of the officers who killed Keunang were ""in policy.""Keunang, a 43-year-old Cameroonian immigrant who was known as ""Africa"" in Skid Row, was shot six times, including twice in the chest. He was not armed. The commission's ruling described body camera footage of the incident, saying it showed Keunang's hand ""holding onto"" the officer's gun as it was ""substantially removed"" from the holster. But the ruling was not accompanied by release of those videos, which were recorded by cameras worn by two officers on the scene.The LAPD and the civilian commission both told The Huffington Post that there is no plan to release the videos in the future. In effect, the public will yet again have to take the police at their word.The decision not to release critical footage in this case underscores broader concerns about the efficacy of body cameras. Law enforcement agencies across the country have begun adopting the equipment for the stated purpose of fostering transparency. If they're permitted to suppress video when it's potentially damning to police, however, many critics argue that transparency comes with an asterisk.""LAPD's refusal to release the body-worn video footage seriously undercuts the Department's credibility and makes it seem like they have something to hide,"" said Peter Bibring, director of police practices at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. ""If the video so clearly shows the officer acted properly, they should release it.""He added, ""Of course, the department should release video of shootings and other serious uses of force regardless. When police kill a civilian, the public deserves to judge for themselves what happened and whether officers' use of deadly force seems appropriate to the communities' standards."" While the body camera videos in Keunang's case have not been released publicly, a handful of journalists have reviewed the footage. Their observations suggest the recordings raise significant doubt about the officers' tactics and use of lethal force. Jeff Sharlet wrote in a GQ story last year that the videos make a few things clear:Charly does not have the gun, of this there is no question. He may have reached for it. His arm may have convulsed. He may have never come near. [LAPD Officer Joshua] Volasgis will tell the detectives he was straddling the suspect, by which he means his right hip — his gun — was close, or close enough to Charly's hand. He will insist that the suspect had ""defeated"" the two safety measures on his holster. He will say he was holding the suspect's hand down as the suspect attempted to draw his weapon. And yet, on [Sgt. Chand] Syed's and [Officer Francisco] Martinez's cam footage, we cannot see Charly reach. Volasgis will say the suspect lets go of his pistol only after the first shot is fired. But this is not true. When Martinez shoots Charly, Volasgis is already on his way to standing. The gun is beyond reach.Reporters at the Los Angeles Times, who also reviewed the police video, said the footage showed Volasgis' gun still in its holster after Keunang was shot.There are other recordings that the public has seen: surveillance video from a nearby building and cell phone video taken by an eyewitness. The latter begins with Keunang spinning toward a group of LAPD officers, arms flailing. One officer punches Keunang and tackles him to the ground, where the scuffle continues. Moments later, Keunang is dead.But those videos were filmed at a greater distance than the body camera footage, and it’s difficult to discern what exactly is happening in the former. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck has maintained that Keunang reached for the holstered gun and that his officers had no choice but to defend themselves. Not everyone is willing to trust him.Before Tuesday's announcement, the Los Angeles Community Action Network, which focuses on issues affecting the city's low-income and homeless residents, had argued that the civilian commission was stalling on Keunang's case and even tried to keep it ""under wraps.""Network members were in attendance when Matt Johnson, president of the police commission, announced its conclusion that the killing occurred ""in policy.""The commission did cite Officer Volasgis for being ""out of policy"" in that he failed ""to maintain control"" of his pistol and baton.Keunang's family has filed a $20 million wrongful-death lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. Joshua Piovia-Scott, the family's lawyer, called for the LAPD to release the body camera videos if, as the police claim, they truly show the officers engaging in justifiable behavior.By not doing so, the LAPD risks enhancing suspicions about its treatment of the city's most vulnerable populations and undermining public trust in its commitment to transparency.""To the extent the public supports body cameras, they do so because they believe cameras will be used to provide transparency and hold officers accountable,"" said Bibring. ""But body cameras don't provide transparency if the Department doesn't share the video with the public."""

Ted Cruz and the very liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders more directly into the media spotlight. These two senators are not only from the opposite sides of the aisle but also from the opposite ends of the ideological spectrum.

Using the chart’s “less smoothing” option -- which means the individual polls have more weight and the average is allowed to change faster -- Obama’s approval rating is up to just over 48 percent. Gallup’s tracking poll shows a distinct bump in ratings after the State of the Union address on January 12 and shows him at 50 percent approval as of February 1.

The administration estimated $32 billion a year raised from the tax would be used to fund green transportation and infrastructure improvements. (The White House proposal applies to domestic oil production and oil imports, the Financial Times reported.)The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas lobbying group, quickly said it opposed the proposal.""The White House thinks Americans are not paying enough for gasoline,"" API President and CEO Jack Gerard said in a statement.The proposal amounts to a partial tax on carbon, a policy aimed at fully incorporating the negative impact of fossil fuel use into the market price. A tax of $10 per barrel is the equivalent of a roughly $27 per metric ton price on carbon for oil. Other forms of fossil fuels would not be affected by the proposal. If oil companies were to pass on the tax to consumers at the pump, it would raise prices by about 24 cents a gallon.The API's Gerard said the proposal would ""harm consumers that are enjoying low energy prices, destroy American jobs and reverse America’s emergence as a global energy leader... On his way out of office President Obama has now proposed making the United States less competitive.”The Independent Petroleum Association of America is also unhappy with the proposal.""For the first time in years, the U.S. Congress recently passed a highway funding bill. The Administration had the opportunity to raise funding for our nation’s highways during that time. Why now, instead of then?"" spokesman Neal Kirby said in an email. The current average national price for a gallon of oil is $1.77, according to AAA. Oil prices have fallen dramatically in recent months, from just over $100 dollars a barrel to just over $30 a barrel on Thursday.Shane Ferro contributed reporting.This post has been updated to note that the proposal would apply to domestic oil production and oil imports."
17,POLITICS,"Hillary Clinton's Problem Isn't That She's Not Progressive, It's That She's Cautious",Sam Stein and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-progressive_us_56b2e4a7e4b08069c7a62110,Many of her struggles stem from the political calculations she's made in her career.,2016-02-04,Hillary Clinton has been fending off attacks that she's not progressive enough.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b2e4df1f00000d012174ed.jpeg?cache=x5LzP9LlKf&ops=crop_8_76_3992_2134%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"DERRY, N.H. -- Back in May 2015, when Hillary Clinton's status as a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination seemed slightly more secure, a few of her former aides came to The Huffington Post to discuss what she truly was like as a person and politician. One of the misconceptions that Patti Solis Doyle, one of her closest aides since the 1990s, and Tracy Sefl, her former campaign aide and staunch supporter, sought to dispel was that she was not actually progressive. And the specific topic they addressed was same-sex marriage, since Clinton had just given an interview to NPR that was, at best, awkward in explaining her views on the issue.HuffPost asked Doyle if she believed Clinton was always comfortable with same-sex marriage, despite her previous public opposition.""Yes I do,"" Doyle said. ""Like so many people, views have evolved, right? We are moving with the times, but she has always been comfortable with gay people and gay couples.""Eight months later, Clinton is no longer the solid front-runner she once seemed to be. And her struggles are owed in large part to the political calculations she's made in her career and that Doyle's comments illustrate. The former first lady and Secretary of State is currently under assault from Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) campaign for not being sufficiently progressive. ""Most progressives that I know really do not raise millions of dollars from Wall Street,"" Sanders said Wednesday.On several issues, her record has indeed run more to the ideological center than a pure progressive would like. But the charge glosses over a larger point: Clinton's vulnerability, longtime observers insist, is a tendency towards caution and incrementalism and a willingness to occasionally suppress beliefs out of perceived expediency.""I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,"" Clinton responded Wednesday during the CNN town hall to address the criticism. Indeed, throughout much of her husband's career, she was viewed as an interloping hippie. The attacks were often gendered -- going after Clinton for keeping her maiden name -- but some of them were ideological as well. ""The right started its 20-year jihad against Hillary precisely because she was an advocate for progressive causes and a champion of equal rights,"" said Neera Tanden, president and CEO of the Center for American Progress.Clinton often clashed against the centrists in her husband's White House. One famous example was successfully pushing then-President Bill Clinton to veto bankruptcy reform legislation in the late 1990s, when she joined forces with Elizabeth Warren, who was then still a law professor at Harvard University. A 1998 Warren op-ed moved her to request a meeting examining how the legislation -- pushed by credit card companies -- would disproportionately affect women trying to collect alimony and child support from their ex-husbands.""I never had a smarter student,"" Warren recounted in a 2004 interview with PBS host Bill Moyers. ""When I first started covering her, people would be like, 'She is the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate,'"" Politico's Glenn Thrush, a longtime Clinton chronicler, said at that same HuffPost discussion.Of course, that wasn't entirely true -- either in the Senate or before it. During her husband's administration, she advocated for welfare reform, a policy that Peter Edelman, a longtime Clinton friend, called “The Worst Thing Bill Clinton Has Done"" in a 1997 article for The Atlantic. And when she got to Congress, Clinton showed a tendency to work within the system, rather than against it. She did a complete flip on the bankruptcy reform legislation. Clinton said the measure had been modified to address her concerns about alimony payments, but Warren believed that the ""pressures"" were simply different for her as a senator from New York. She also voted for the Patriot Act, although nearly every other senator -- besides Russ Feingold -- did as well. But the biggest sin was her support for the invasion of Iraq. Still, it's frequently forgotten that during the 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton was often more progressive (on the domestic policy front at least) than President Barack Obama. In late December 2007, Obama trailed Clinton by 22 percentage points among self-described liberal voters. It was her health care plan that called for the universal individual mandate that Obama adopted once in office.So why does Clinton continuously get the centrist tag? Part of it is her associations. During the 2008 campaign, Clinton took a real hit when news broke that her top adviser, Mark Penn, was also working for the Colombian government lobbying for a trade agreement, and when it was revealed that Bill Clinton had taken $800,000 in speaking fees from a Colombia group trying to bring business to the country. From there, it was largely assumed that she, too, was supportive of trade agreements. But the actual record was more complicated. When HuffPost tried to uncover Clinton's position on the North American Free Trade Agreement -- which was the subject of fairly relentless attacks from the Obama campaign -- it found people vouching for her skepticism. ""Honestly, I think it's because folks just equate her with her husband, which, in my view, is either sexist or absurd,"" Tanden said. ""She's a thinking, breathing person with different views and to just equate her is ridiculous. Would we ever do that to a man?"" Her support for the Iraq War has also been cited. As Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide and veteran of that campaign noted, whenever there was a hard argument about ideology, they would be able to ""trump everything with Iraq."" But part of it, truly though, is that ""progressive"" and ""centrist"" labels are impossible to apply to politicians like Clinton, or, really, to many other politicians outside a handful of senators on the far ends of their parties. ""Left versus center, progressive versus moderate -- those are constructs that simply don’t exist outside of the beltway and the activist class anymore,"" said Mo Elleithee, a former Clinton aide and executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics. ""No one gives a shit about those labels. They want to know who is going to wake up every morning fighting for them and fighting to level the playing field."" Clinton certainly has steadfast beliefs. But she's also more of a tactician than your full-hearted ideologue. Her theory of governance involves an implicit tradeoff: more legislation will get done but bolder stances -- like coming out for marriage equality before it is more politically safe to do so -- will be sacrificed. And whereas Sanders promises to commit to a position and negotiate from there, Clinton pledges to negotiate her way towards that position.Also on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) slammed President Barack Obama's visit to a mosque on Wednesday, during which the president denounced anti-Muslim rhetoric, for ""pitting people against each other.""But Rubio, who often advocates for religious liberty and speaks of his faith on the campaign trail, is the one engaging in divisive rhetoric.After Donald Trump said he would consider shutting down U.S. mosques in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which were carried out by Islamic extremists, Rubio declined to discount the idea in an interview on Fox News: It’s not about closing down mosques. It’s about closing down any place -- whether it’s a cafe, a diner, an internet site -- any place where radicals are being inspired. The bigger problem we have is our inability to find out where these places are, because we’ve crippled our intelligence programs, both through unauthorized disclosures by a traitor in Edward Snowden, or by some of the things this president has put in place with the support even of some from my own party to diminish our intelligence capabilities.In contrast, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called the notion of shutting down mosques and creating a database of Muslims ""just wrong.""During the last Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Rubio suggested that radical Muslims who have not turned to violence do not have a right to free speech under the First Amendment because the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State is ""unprecedented.""""Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk, it's hate action. They blow people up. Look at what they did in San Bernardino, look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia ... where a guy shot a police officer three times, told the police 'I did it because I was inspired by ISIS,'"" he said. On the matter of Syrian refugees, Rubio has been all over the place. In September, the senator said he was open to admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees because of America's historical role of harboring the oppressed. A month later, after the Paris attacks, Rubio ruled out refugees entirely because, he claimed, the U.S. is not adequately able to vet them.Since then, Rubio has moderated his stance to allow widows and orphans.""Does common sense still apply? Of course it does. A 5-year-old orphan, a 90-year-old widow, a well-known Chaldean priest -- these are obviously common-sense applications, and you can clearly vet them just by common sense,"" he said.As Rubio grows closer to consolidating the establishment wing of the GOP ahead of the New Hampshire primary, he is increasingly viewed as the more sensible, moderate choice to bombastic candidates like Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But his rhetoric on Muslims seems to suggest he is anything but. Also on HuffPost:"

23,POLITICS,More Signs Of Fuzzy Math In The Bernie Sanders Health Plan,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-health_us_56b25e8fe4b04f9b57d83008,"Another week, another report questioning the Sanders proposal's basic assumptions.",2016-02-04,"Bernie Sanders, better at inspiration than arithmetic?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b25f521800006f0080b3a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s new reason to think the numbers in the Bernie Sanders health care plan don’t add up.On Wednesday, the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, released an analysis of Sanders’ proposal to replace existing health insurance arrangements with a single, government-run plan that would look something like Medicare. Sanders has said that his plan would pay for itself, partly by making the U.S. health care system more efficient and partly by raising revenue through a series of new taxes. In the end, Sanders has promised, the vast majority of Americans would actually be better off financially, paying less in taxes under his program than they would pay in premiums plus out-of-pocket expenses under the current system.The center's report disputes that finding. In particular, it says, the taxes that Sanders has sketched out wouldn’t produce as much revenue as Sanders thinks -- creating a shortfall of about $3 trillion over 10 years, or much more if it turns out the program also spends more on insurance benefits than Sanders expects.Like most analyses that circulate during presidential campaigns, this one is rough. And the Sanders campaign is challenging the report by assailing the credibility of the source -- something it also did last week, when a prominent health care economist released a similarly critical analysis.But if the findings from this new report are even in the right ballpark, then either the benefits Sanders has promised would have to be smaller, the taxes for the plan would have to be higher, or the program as a whole would create huge new deficits.One way or another, that would change the calculus of how many people end up better off and how many end up worse off -- maybe dramatically.What The New Report SaysNobody disputes that the plan Sanders touts would be an expensive proposition. If the proposal became law, the federal government would be paying the medical bills of everybody in America, with zero cost-sharing for most services. According to an independent estimate that the Sanders campaign commissioned, the price tag for providing so many people with such generous coverage would come to something like $13.8 trillion over 10 years.Such a program would increase total federal spending -- that is, the cost of everything that the government does, from food stamps to defense spending -- by somewhere between one-fourth and one-third.Sanders has said that a single-payer system can offset some of that new cost by reducing what the U.S. spends on medical care -- partly by eliminating administrative expenses related to billing and partly by forcing the suppliers of treatment and supplies, particularly the makers of prescription drugs, to lower their prices. As proof, he has cited the relative record of single-payer systems abroad, where governments cover everybody while spending less than the U.S. does.To provide the remaining financing, Sanders would seek new taxes. Some of these levies, like a higher tax rate on large estates, would fall exclusively on the wealthy. Two others, a new 6.2 percent payroll tax on employers and a 2.2 percent “income-related premium,” would apply to all workers. Although the tax increases together would dwarf any increase in recent history, Sanders says the money most people save from the elimination of premiums and (most) out-of-pocket expenses would be even bigger.But those calculations are flawed, the new report says. A big problem, the center’s analysts explain, is that the Sanders campaign fails to account for the ways wealthy people avoid taxes when rates reach the levels that Sanders has in mind. Altogether, the report says, the plan’s taxes would produce revenue short of the official Sanders projection, to the tune of $3.1 trillion over 10 years -- or about one-third of the program's total official cost.The report is the second in two weeks to scrutinize the arithmetic of Sanders' health plan. The previous report, from Emory University professor Kenneth Thorpe, suggests that estimates of health care savings in the Sanders plan are even more off the mark. Among the reasons: Such severe reductions in hospital payments would cause closures and shortages that neither the industry nor the public would tolerate.What The Sanders Campaign SaysThe Sanders campaign has stood by its original estimates, which University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman produced, by citing a letter of general support from 100 advocates and experts on economics or health care -- as well as a separate analysis from the co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Plan, the nation’s leading advocate for single-payer insurance. Campaign officials have also questioned the credibility of critics -- noting that Thorpe, who served in the Clinton administration, has in the past done work for health industry clients.On Wednesday, Warren Gunnels, policy director for the Sanders campaign, responded to the latest report in much the same way -- by citing its ties to Pete Peterson, a Wall Street tycoon known for his advocacy of balanced budgets and concerns over entitlement spending. (Peterson serves on the organization's board of directors; the Peter G. Peterson Foundation provides some of its funding.) “It's disappointing but not surprising that a group funded by Wall Street billionaire Pete Peterson would issue a misleading and inaccurate report attacking Sen. Sanders health care plan,” Gunnels said.But the center's analysts have a reputation for intellectually sound work. They are relying on the same theories about tax policy that economists at the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation use. And they are hardly the only respected experts raising questions about the assumptions in the Sanders plan -- and whether those assumptions are realistic.Most of these students of health policy have praised single-payer systems before, because they realize the model really does produce more coverage at less cost overseas. But they doubt that transplanting that system into the existing American health care infrastructure would deliver similar results -- and they don't think Sanders and his advisers have accounted for that."

At a panel hosted by HuffPost on Wednesday, Bair coolly dismissed both the Oscar-nominated film and the Michael Lewis book it is based on for making heroes out of villains.""I haven't seen the movie and I didn't read much of the book,"" Bair said. ""It kind of made me mad.""Wall Street investors who bet against the housing market, Bair told the panel, weren't just making money by fueling the housing collapse -- something the book and film both acknowledge. Many short sellers also actively opposed government efforts to fix the mortgage mess, because helping troubled homeowners would wreck their bets.""I was an early advocate for trying to get mortgages restructured in a massive, systemic way, because we had a big problem,"" she said. ""And there were people who shorted the ABX index, who I assume are the ones being kind of backhandedly glorified in this book, who were actively opposing us because they made money. The more people who lost their houses, the more money they made.""Watch Bair's comments in the video below. The ABX index was an aggregate of securities tied to mortgages. ""The Big Short"" doesn't focus on the ABX index, but rather on short-sellers who helped create the securities that constitute it. By offering to bet against the housing market, these short sellers gave banks the ability to create new ""synthetic"" securities tied to risky mortgages. Others could then bet against these securities by short selling the ABX index.""Even in a backhanded way, I don't like movies that glorify people who were pursuing that agenda,"" Bair added. ""And I think they were more lucky than smart. But for that reason, I have not seen that movie and probably will not. Sorry.""Other former regulators on the panel Wednesday were more sympathetic to the film. ""It was a brilliant exposition of some very complex issues,"" said Brooksley Born, former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ""There's much more to the story. I thought it was a very good illustration of that slice of the story.""HuffPost organized the event to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's official report on the causes of the banking collapse. Born was a member of that commission.""A real tragedy of this crisis is Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve were the one institution that had the ability to set mortgage lending standards, and despite enormous evidence … they did nothing,"" said Phil Angelides, former FCIC chairman.""The Big Short"" has received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing.

25,POLITICS,The Fight Between Sanders And Clinton Isn't A Purity Test. It's A Genuine Divide Over Gender And Corporate Power.,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-progressivism-divide_us_56b39b58e4b04f9b57d8c76f,Elizabeth Warren lit the fuse.,2016-02-04,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have illuminated a deep rift within the Democratic Party, and it isn't just a matter of details. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3a8191800002d0080b4f7.jpeg?cache=PViOjGXILi&ops=crop_102_221_2803_1358%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The increasingly contentious primary battle between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton is about much more than a Twitter fight or different theories of change. The deepening divide between the two candidates -- even more acrimonious among their respective supporters -- reflects a major rift within the Democratic Party over gender, corporate power and the very idea of what a just society looks like.Elizabeth Warren first opened this rift when she built herself into the second-most popular figure in the Democratic Party by railing against Democratic support for Wall Street. With a man now carrying Warren's anti-corporate message in the presidential primary, the implications of her ideology are roiling the party even further. The primary struggle between Clinton and Sanders is now a referendum on the model of progress it has pursued since the late 1970s.At Pajiba, Courtney Enlow makes the case for Clinton and her vision of progress. A lot of the power of Enlow's piece is in its presentation. But she essentially argues that:1) Sanders supporters don't realize that much of what they perceive to be Clinton's flaws are actually just their own gendered understanding of power bouncing around in their subconscious. 2) Electing the first woman president is a really big deal that will change the perception of women. It will also make Problem No. 1 less of an issue going forward.3) Clinton used to support some bad policies, but now she supports good policies, and that's OK.4) ""YOU DON'T LIKE THAT SHE PLAYS THE GAME? THAT SHE HAS TIES TO THE ESTABLISHMENT? FOR ONE THING, THAT'S HOW SHIT FUCKING GETS DONE.""Her first two points are obviously true. The others are more interesting.Clinton clearly has more liberal positions on marriage equality and queer justice today than she did in the 1990s, and a more progressive stance on immigration than she did in 2008.But other policies have been consistent. She remains a foreign policy hawk. She has always been a strong defender of abortion rights and has consistently supported equal pay and workplace fairness for women at home and abroad.On economic justice, her record doesn't conform to a straight line of progress or decay. She did good things for childhood poverty when she worked for the Children's Defense Fund. Then she was an aggressive supporter of welfare reform, which infuriated CDF founder Marian Wright Edelman -- whose husband Peter Edelman, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, resigned in protest. This isn't a ""times have changed"" thing. Like her peers in the childhood poverty advocacy community, Clinton had the experience to know that welfare reform would drive a lot of kids into poverty. She supported it anyway.Warren has taken Clinton to task for opposing a toxic bankruptcy bill when she was first lady, only to vote for it as a senator in 2001 and then skip another vote on it in 2005, when it was actually enacted. Clinton has said she wishes she could take back the 2001 vote, but defended her action by saying she had conditioned her support on a change to the bill.The bankruptcy bill basically made it harder for people in financial distress to discharge credit card debt. Clinton didn't tinker with that, but she roped off child support so that credit card companies couldn't seize those funds when seeking payment. This makes Clinton more progressive than Joe Biden on the issue, since Biden was the man pushing the entire package on behalf of credit card companies.But even with Clinton's changes, the bill was still a financial blow to poor and middle-class people, particularly single mothers and children. The bill just wasn't as bad as it had been before. Clinton was not forced to cut the best deal she could on a bill that would inevitably pass -- because it didn't actually pass in 2001.This theme running throughout her economic policy record suggests that her tenure on on the board of directors at Walmart and her six-figure speeches at Goldman Sachs aren't just anomalies, and Enlow doesn't pretend that they are. Clinton has always been close to big money, and it's reflected in her record. It's part of how ""shit fucking gets done.""Enlow's view of ""the establishment"" here obviously isn't a dumb swipe at the Human Rights Campaign or Planned Parenthood. It's a reference to corporate power. ""How shit fucking gets done"" thus restricts the realm of ""shit"" to things that corporate power is willing to go along with under the right circumstances. Enlow is essentially making a statement about priorities. Gender equality and gay rights are more important issues for her -- at least at the moment -- than limiting corporate influence in American politics or rethinking the nation's constant state of war.This isn't an argument about electability. A major theme of Enlow's piece is the idea that it's a lot harder for a woman to win an election than for a man to do so. It's worth rolling the dice on Clinton now, because the prospects for gender progress are so much better than they will be at any foreseeable time. A woman could actually become president, and -- sorry, Carly Fiorina -- a woman with a strong and improving record on gender equality.This reasoning reflects a different vision of progress than what many Sanders supporters believe in. Some Sanders supporters are straightforward economic determinists who think fixing corporate power will solve gender and race problems. Sanders himself has said he thinks the slow pace of progress on racial justice has been ""to a large degree"" driven by the influence of big political donors. A more nuanced view would be that there is no true gender or racial justice without economic justice. Class doesn't determine gender or race politics, but each concept relies on the other for part of its meaning. Clinton's bankruptcy bill vote, for instance, wasn't just a class issue. It was also a gender equality issue and a childhood development issue.Slicing off class or race or gender and attempting to cope with them as wholly isolated problems not only blocks progress on the others, it also limits what you can do on the issue you choose. Under this view, shrugging off corporate power as an inalterable fact of life -- something you just have to learn to get along with so you can fix other problems -- is a fundamental barrier to progress.Seriously taking on corporate power will be pretty difficult with a Republican Congress. The same is true for implementing equal pay laws. But just as Enlow sees a Clinton election as a rare opportunity, Sanders supporters see the election of a self-proclaimed democratic socialist as a once-in-a-lifetime moment.Of course, most political support is the result of a series of unthinking hunches and feelings, and in this case, a lot of what's going on is straight sexism and red-scare paranoia. But it's a mistake to see the split within the essay-writing class as nothing more than the narcissism of small differences among people who basically agree. There are genuinely different perspectives at work about the future of the Democratic Party.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

The singer and fashion icon tweeted Thursday about the music industry's history of racism against black artists. She cited the fact that while black people have made seminal contributions to music, white music critics still lack the knowledge and respect for these contributions. Knowles was referencing New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica's comments on a podcast in 2013, where he suggested that her tweets were tantamount to ""biting the hand that feeds her."" Well, the singer didn't appreciate that comment one bit, and she expressed that in the tweets that followed in her Twitter clapback session on Thursday.

The complaint was filed by a supporter of Doug Owens, Love's challenger for re-election.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- After paying back taxpayers more than $1,000 for questionable flights and other transportation costs last year, freshman Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) is now facing a complaint that details new allegations of ethics violations, The Huffington Post has learned.The complaint was filed on Jan. 28 by South Jordan attorney Craig N. Janis, who supports Love's challenger in her re-election bid, Democrat Doug Owens. Janis also previously worked for the Utah Democratic Party. In his complaint, obtained by HuffPost, Janis requests that the Office of Congressional Ethics open an investigation into Love’s “repeated misuse of official resources for campaign and personal purposes.” The complaint also accuses Love, a rising star in the GOP, of violations that have previously gone unreported.Janis told HuffPost the Doug Owens campaign asked if he’d be willing to file the complaint.The complaint accuses Love of breaking House rules pertaining to campaign and official websites by linking to her official House website from her campaign site and by posting political commentary on her House website.The complaint includes a URL to a since-revised contact page on Love’s campaign website and a screen grab of the page, which read: “I appreciate your feedback. Please go to love.house.gov/contact to reach me.” This appeared on Love’s campaign page beginning in January 2015 and as recently as November of last year, the complaint states. House Ethics rules stipulate that a member’s campaign website can link to their official website, but must use the notification approved by the Committee on Ethics, which states, “Thank you for visiting my campaign page. If your intention was to visit my official House of Representatives page, please click here.”If a member wants to use any other language in their disclaimer, they need to get it approved by the committee first. The complaint also alleges a second violation was made when Love posted political commentary -- link to a video of Love talking about conservative policies and the Kentucky gubernatorial race on the Fox Business network -- on her House website. According to the House Ethics Manual, a member’s website “may not include personal, political, or campaign information.”The new accusations and first official complaint come just three months after Love said she would pay back taxpayer money after using it to buy a $537.10 plane ticket in February 2015 that she never ended up using. It was the second reimbursement Love made in the span of two months. The first came after The Hill reported Love had used money from her congressional allowance to pay for a trip to Washington, D.C., to attend the White House Correspondents Association dinner last April. The total came to $1,160, which Love later said she would repay. When questioned about Love’s use of the money to attend a primarily social event, dubbed “nerd prom” in Washington, Love's spokesman said that she flew back for an official meeting with staff. Janis, an attorney in Utah who runs a company that designs websites and mobile apps, said he has two goals with the complaint. “I hope that the House Ethics office will take it seriously” and investigate, he said. “Second, I hope that people here in her district, my neighbors here, will get a little more informed about how she’s behaved in office and see that maybe this complaint is not the kind of stuff somebody is going to jail for ... but are serious things that I feel like reflect a general lack of attention to detail from her and her job,” he added.Janis’ complaint isn’t the first time Love has been accused of violating rules. A batch of emails obtained by HuffPost in 2014 revealed that during her time as mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, Love would occasionally receive campaign questions on her mayoral email account and would respond directly rather than reply through a personal or campaign account. Love’s spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Office of Congressional Ethics has not yet returned a call requesting comment."

In an interview with the U.K.'s Channel 4 News, posted online Wednesday, the award-winning actress said, ""I think it’s unfair to attack the Academy. It just so happens this year, it went that way.""Mirren isn't excusing the Academy's failure to recognize people of color, but she does believe the issue of race in Hollywood goes much deeper than the Oscars. (For context, not one actor of color, male or female, has been nominated for an award for the past two years.)""The issue we need to be looking at is what happens to the film before it gets to the Oscars,"" she explained. ""What kind of films are made. And the way in which they are cast. And the scripts. And go all the way back to the writing of the scripts. It’s those things that are much more influential ultimately than who stands with an Oscar."" Mirren did note, however, that Idris Elba should have been nominated for his role in Netflix's ""Beasts of No Nation."" (Elba recently won a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.) In her opinion, ""He wasn’t [nominated] because not enough people saw or wanted to see a film about child soldiers.""Other stars who've spoken out about the lack of diversity at the Oscars include Jada Pinkett Smith and Spike Lee, who both plan to skip the award show, as well as David Oyelowo, who was notably snubbed for his role as Martin Luther King Jr. in last year's ""Selma."" ""The Academy has a problem. It’s a problem that needs to be solved,"" Oyelowo said at an event honoring Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs in January. ""For 20 opportunities to celebrate actors of color, actresses of color, to be missed last year is one thing; for that to happen again this year is unforgivable."" Oyelowo continued, ""This institution doesn’t reflect its president and it doesn’t reflect this room. I am an Academy member and it doesn’t reflect me, and it doesn’t reflect this nation.""Since the controversy began at the beginning of this year, Boone Isaacs has also addressed the issue and announced plans to diversify the Academy's membership. With a little over two weeks before the Oscars ceremony is set to take place, the conversation about diversity will likely continue and it'll be interesting to see how or if the issue comes up during the show.

The company admitted its innovation shortcomings a couple years back, but these days the newsroom is rife with experimentation in things like visual storytelling, podcasting, reader engagement and virtual reality.Now, executive editor Dean Baquet told staff Thursday, ""it is time to catch our breath and come up with a shared vision for what our report, and ultimately the New York Times newsroom, should look like in the coming years.""In a memo, Baquet said he will work with top masthead editors to examine the newsroom's structure and that he has tapped David Leonhardt to help lead the effort. Leonhardt, a prominent economics writer and founding editor of The Upshot, was recently named a columnist, but now the start of that column will be delayed until the summer. Baquet applauded his staff's recent innovation efforts, but stressed that it's important to figure out what's working and what isn't in order to determine the best course forward. ""Experimenting with new forms of journalism and presentation has sparked tremendous creativity in the newsroom,"" he wrote. ""But in trying to balance the new and the old, reporters and editors are sometimes left exhausted and confused. Simply put, we keep turning things on -- greater visual journalism, live news blogs, faster enterprise, podcasting, racing against an ever-growing list of new competitors on an expanding list of stories – without ever turning things off.""""We need to develop a strategic plan for what The New York Times should be, and determine how to apply our timeless values to a new age,"" Baquet added. In the memo, Baquet discussed how the Times currently determines which stories should warrant the paper's full arsenal of digital, print and visual resources and whether the current desk structure -- Metro, National, International and others -- is best way to tackle big stories like climate change and education. He posed a number of questions which, presumably, he and others involved will hope to answer in the coming months. ""We deeply value the craft of editing, but in the digital era should we continue to edit every update of every story at the same level?"" he asked. ""How much of our coverage is duplicative because we have never resolved overlapping jurisdictions? Which parts of our newsroom have not grown quickly enough? How will the newsroom change as it becomes more internationally focused?""This deep, structural examination could lead to some cuts. The Times has bucked the trend among legacy newspaper companies by maintaining a robust, 1,300-person newsroom -- even after several rounds of layoffs and buyouts. Baquet recently told public editor Margaret Sullivan that ""given the reality of the journalism world we’re in, we certainly can’t get any bigger and we probably have to get a little smaller.""In Tuesday's memo, Baquet wrote that the breadth and depth of the staff is ""the bedrock of our mission and our business,"" but acknowledged that the company ""has to look for judicious savings everywhere, and that includes the newsroom.""Still, he wrote, ""instead of cuts and additions without a clear picture of where we are headed, we want to approach the task thoughtfully, with our mission and values clearly in mind.""""Everything we do must either be part of that mission or help generate the revenue to sustain our journalistic dominance,"" he continued. ""We must turn some things off, and build up the areas that set us apart. We must cast a fresh eye on our coverage to determine whether some of it reflects old habits rather than the urgent goal of telling our readers what they most need to know.Read Baquet's full memo below:To the newsroom:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats blocked a sweeping energy bill from moving forward Thursday after negotiations stalled over including aid to help with the water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan.Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats of Michigan, started pushing the issue last week as the Senate began debate on the energy bill. Their provision would provide $600 million in emergency funding to Flint to replace and fix the city’s water supply infrastructure and establish a center dedicated to helping people in Flint recover from lead poisoning. Republicans scolded Democrats for using the crisis to play politics, and argued it is a state and local problem. Ahead of the procedural vote, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) delivered scathing remarks on the floor, accusing Republicans of abandoning the people of Flint. “One hundred thousand people in Flint, Michigan, have been poisoned, and Republicans do nothing,” Reid said. “Nine thousand little children -- all under the age of 6 -- have been poisoned, their brains attack by the contaminated water. Still, Senate Republicans refuse to help.” That was met with a fiery response from Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) after the Democrats filibustered the underlying bill in a 43-54 vote.“The Democratic caucus has come together and brought down this bipartisan bill ... at least for the time being,” Cornyn said. “We know the vote that just went down wasn’t about the energy bill; this is about trying to embarrass Republicans, and to try to make us look bad and portray us as having no compassion for the poor people in Flint.”The bulk of the money provided by the Stabenow measure would go toward removing Flint's lead pipes, something Democrats haven't proposed doing anywhere other than Flint. Roughly 10 million homes and buildings across America are served by lead pipes.Cornyn added that the money Democrats are trying to send to Flint wouldn’t help because the state of Michigan and the city of Flint don’t know what to do to fix the problem yet, or how much it will cost. A main hold-up for Republicans is finding an offset that will pay for the money directed to Flint. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said talks will continue over the weekend between the bill’s manager, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Democratic counterpart Sen. Maria Cantwell (Wash.) to find a way forward.Democrats have united behind the Flint crisis, trying to corner Republicans on the issue in both chambers the entire week. One by one, Senate Democrats filed onto the chamber floor Thursday morning to decry the situation in Flint and attack Republicans. At least six spoke ahead of the vote.“This is of catastrophic, almost Armageddon proportion, that an American city has been poisoned,” said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.).Her voice rising, Mikulski shouted, “Let’s get real.” “We are now bogged down in Washington wonky budgeteer talk: 'Where is the offsets?' What is this? What is this? Are we human beings?” she said. Both sides appeared ready to continue negotiations after the failed vote. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) expressed optimism that a path forward could be found, but only if legislators resolve their differences over how to help Flint. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) criticized his colleagues for trying to find an easy solution to move the Flint provision.“There ain’t going to be an easy solution,” Inhofe said. “We’re talking about too much money, but we still have compassion for the people and we think we have something to offer that would solve the compassion and the offset problem.”Inhofe’s amendment would offer $200 million to help Flint by taking funds from a vehicle research program under the Energy Department. It hasn’t gained traction with Democrats. Murkowski, who had shepherded the bill from her committee to the floor, is committed to helping Flint, her spokesman Michael Tadeo said, even if Republicans and Democrats don’t agree on the final details of a provision. Flint's water spoiled in 2014 because the state and local governments failed to treat it with anti-corrosion chemicals following the city's switch to the Flint River as its water source; the water then leached lead from the city's pipes. Last fall, a local pediatrician showed Flint kids had higher lead levels in their blood after the water switch, prompting officials to switch the source back after they had denied all along that the problem existed. It's still unclear when the water will be safe to drink. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) has pushed for increased federal funding to help with Flint's water woes, seeking a disaster declaration from the Obama administration that would unlock $96 million in direct water assistance. Instead, the administration granted an emergency declaration and provided $80 million, much of which would be devoted to longer-term water infrastructure projects. Separately, Snyder has requested tens of millions in assistance from the Michigan legislature.On the House side, several Flint residents brought bottles of filthy water to a congressional hearing on the Flint water crisis earlier this week. Republicans had called the hearing to take the Environmental Protection Agency to task for its failure to act swiftly in response to the Flint crisis last year. Keeping attention on Flint, House Democrats also plan to hold their own hearing on the crisis next week."

So when they go missing there's almost nothing they wouldn't do to get them back.That includes an Indiana couple who, after searching for their beloved pet cat for two weeks, turned to none other than a pet detective -- who solved the case in three days' time.""Jim Berns, pet detective,"" the Cincinnati-based private eye introduced himself to ABC 6 News.""That's kind of crazy, but when we go out there and work with these folks we really come out in a very professional manner,"" he said.It was Jan. 16 when Marmalade took off from Franklin home of Andrew Cummins and Diane Trout-Cummins, they said. When the 7-month-old cat didn't return, the owners said they nearly went berserk.""We slept by the back door on an air mattress and I mean, we were checking the door every few minutes,"" Trout-Cummins told ABC. Then they turned to Google, where they found Berns' listing.Berns' team of hound dogs took a whiff of one of Marmalade's blankets and set off, Berns said, taking them to an area beneath a neighbor's porch, about two blocks away.There was no Marmalade, but they set up a trap there just in case. Two days later, they checked the cage and found the couple's precious kitty inside. Berns has worked as a part-time pet detective throughout the Cincinnati area for the last eight years, he told the Daily Journal. His team in the search for Marmalade included three dogs -- a bloodhound, a bluetick coonhound and a hound/mastiff mix.He boasts a near 70 percent success rate with 377 cases under his belt, he said. Not all are for missing cats and dogs.""We've searched for three turtles and got all three back,"" he told the Journal.That's not to say that all of his successes had happy endings. Some of the lost animals have been found dead.""If you find a pet that's been killed or died, at least the owner has some closure. They know for sure what happened to the dog, and you can put that behind you,"" he told the Columbus Dispatch in 2008. ""We think it's a positive either way.""Also on HuffPost:"
33,SPORTS,The NFL Will Implement A 'Rooney Rule' For Women,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-nfl-will-implement-a-rooney-rule-for-women_us_56b3a045e4b08069c7a67110,The new rule aims to increase the number of female executives in the league.,2016-02-04,"Jen Welter became the first woman to serve as an NFL coach during the 2015 preseason. On Thursday, commissioner Roger Goodell announced a new initiative that aims to increase the number of women working in NFL executive roles.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The NFL will implement a new hiring rule aimed at increasing the number of women serving in executive roles across the league, Commissioner Roger Goodell announced Thursday.The rule will be modeled after the “Rooney Rule,” a 2003 standard the league adopted that requires teams and the league to interview minority candidates for coaching and executive vacancies.“We have something called the Rooney Rule which requires us to make sure that when we have an opening ... that we are going to interview a diverse slate of candidates,” Goodell announced in San Francisco at the first-ever NFL Women’s Summit ahead of Super Bowl 50. “We are going to formalize that we as a league are going to do that for women as well in all of our executive positions.”Women broke several barriers in the NFL during the 2015 season. Referee Sarah Thomas became the league’s first full-time female official when she took the field at the start of the season. Jen Welter, meanwhile, became the first woman to serve in a coaching role when the Arizona Cardinals hired her as an assistant coaching intern during the preseason.In January, the Buffalo Bills hired Kathryn Smith as the league’s first woman to serve in a full-time coaching role.The establishment of the rule will ensure that the league “keeps making progress,” Goodell said. He said the new rule will apply to executive positions throughout the league rather than to coaching positions. The rule has not yet been finalized and there remain details to iron out, a league spokesperson said.“It’s a very positive step,” said Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a former Olympic champion and civil rights lawyer who now runs Champion Women, a nonprofit organization that advocates for increased opportunities for girls and women in sports.“If the NFL can be the leader, surely other leagues and NCAA member schools can follow suit,” she said, adding that she hopes the rule will one day apply to coaching positions as well.Women held 30 percent of the vice president-level positions in the NFL's league office in 2014, and roughly 23 percent of the vice president-level positions with NFL teams, according to The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport.Women held 22 percent of the league’s senior administration positions, which include jobs like legal counsel and director of community relations, and 32 percent of professional administrative positions, including jobs like assistant directors, video coordinators and some supervisory positions, in 2014, according to the report.The NFL has never had a female general manager, though Amy Trask served as the CEO of Oakland Raiders for 16 years before stepping down in 2013.The report gave the NFL a C+ grade for its gender-hiring practices across the league during the 2014 season, an improvement over past seasons.The Rooney Rule -- named after Dan Rooney, who was the chairman of the league’s diversity committee -- has been widely credited with increasing the number of minority coaches across the NFL since its implementation more than a decade ago.African-Americans held seven general manager or chief personnel positions at the start of the 2015 season. There were 19 African-Americans serving as head coaches or top coordinators when the season began, including five head coaches (Ron Rivera, who will coach the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 on Sunday, is the league’s only Hispanic head coach). Those are all improvements from 2003, when the rule was adopted.Recent studies, however, have painted a bleaker picture of the rule’s effectiveness at breaking down the barriers facing minority coaching and executive candidates.White assistant coaches, for instance, are still twice as likely to get promoted as their black counterparts, according to a recent study from researchers at Georgetown, George Washington University, Emory College and Iowa State, often because white coaches still receive the types of assistant coaching jobs that are likeliest to lead to promotions. Other studies have made similar points about minority coaches’ access to key assistant positions.That has sparked calls for a re-evaluation of -- and potential reforms to -- the rule. Still, advocates like Hogshead-Makar see benefits in a similar rule for women, especially given that they have had few opportunities to break into male-dominated sports leagues and positions in the past.“It is a mixed picture, but at least you’re having people interview that are not just the same people recycled over and over,” Hogshead-Makar said. “There’s just no way, when faced with someone who’s highly qualified, to still hold that stereotype that this is not a place for women.”“Think of all those kids who have aspirations for a career in sports, for them to know that this is not an all-male purview,” she continued. “You’re opening up the world. For 50 percent of the population to know that there’s a place for them in the sports world is huge.”"
