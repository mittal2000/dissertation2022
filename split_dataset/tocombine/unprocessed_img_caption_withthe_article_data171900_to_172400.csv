2,WEDDINGS,Does The General Petraeus Affair Signal That It's Time For A New Strategy In Our Monogamy Battles?,"Kate Schermerhorn, Contributor
Filmmaker, ""After Happily Ever After""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/post_us_5b9c84eae4b03a1dcc7f64cc,"Let's just be honest here -- General Petraeus, his former mistress, Paula Broadwell, and even his jovial wife, Holly, along with the rest of us, are forcing ourselves into a box we don't naturally fit into.",2012-11-15,"FILE - This Feb. 2, 2012 file photo shows CIA Director David Petraeus testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington. When Defense Secretary Leon Panetta pointedly warned young troops last spring to mind their ways, he may have been lecturing the wrong audience. The culture of military misconduct starts at the top. At least five current and former U.S. general officers have been reprimanded or investigated for possible misconduct in the past two weeks _ a startling run of embarrassment for a military whose stock among Americans rose so high during a decade of war that its leaders seemed almost untouchable. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c84ea25000033003618cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"First, General David Petraeus gets caught in an affair because his jealous soccer-mom-mistress thinks he has cheated on her with another woman. Then, it turns out he was only cheating on his wife and not on his lover, too. Well, that was a relief. But through the process, woman #2, a Florida housewife with a very big rock on her finger, becomes linked to General John Allen, with whom she has allegedly exchanged some 30,000 pages of flirtatious messages, which leads to speculation that there could have been an affair between these other two married people. General Allen says there was no improper relationship and for his sake, let's hope that's the case, since adultery is a crime in the U.S military (this seems a little unreasonable, but that's beside the point).Just to add to the lunacy, the woman with the big rock also received a shirtless photo from the FBI agent who has been investigating this whole mess. Do we know whether he is also married? I'm not sure, I just can't keep up. And are all the other spouses being faithful? Let's hope so because otherwise we are going to have to worry about a genuine security breach -- one that reveals a team of comedy writers who have taken over the FBI.Where does the madness end, or rather -- shouldn't the madness end?Clearly all it takes is a little FBI surface scratching to find that infidelity is rampant. And that the more powerful you are, the more likely you are to get caught and have to face public shame.Let's just be honest here -- General Petraeus, his former mistress, Paula Broadwell, and even his jovial wife, Holly, along with the rest of us, are forcing ourselves into a box we don't naturally fit into. As discussed in great detail by husband and wife team David Barash and Judith Lipton in their 2002 book, ""The Myth of Monogamy"", we are not monogamous by nature, so fidelity is a very challenging trick to pull off. As Barash and Lipton also point out in their book, there are many obvious benefits to monogamy, including the reality that courtship and mating are risky and leave humans (as well as other non-monogamous animals) ""vulnerable to rejection, injury, bad choices, or just plain wasting of time and energy,"" not to mention sexually-transmitted diseases. There is no doubt that there are many benefits to monogamy, but maybe it's time to be a little more realistic about the whole thing. Maybe we have to accept the sad reality -- we've tried and failed the Total Monogamy Test. It isn't working, even if we (myself included) wish it were. And if it isn't working, what about tweaking the system, even just slightly, in order to allow loving, committed relationships to stand a better chance of survival, and more importantly...happiness? Just for starters, maybe some of these approaches are worth considering:The French Approach: Some people might say we should just be more like the French and ignore the occasional indiscretion, knowing that extramarital sex is just human nature in its purest form. I do wonder if it's more like a step back in time (to about 1950) than a step forward, but I'm certain it could work well for some. Open Relationships or Polyamory: Hats off to those evolved people who can pull this off without jealousy. I'm not sure how people have time for multiple relationships when just one takes a lot of time and energy, but clearly some people find a way. (And on that note, how on earth did General Petraeus find any time for an affair?) Get-Out-Of-Bed-Free Cards: Turn in your card and your partner turns a blind eye to a night with someone else. Each partner could get a certain number of cards at the start of the relationship to use at any time or maybe they could be doled out annually. They could even be handed out in barter system fashion, either with an expiration date or not. The possibilities are endless.Relationship Hiatus: An annual no-questions-asked (or tell-all, if you prefer) hiatus from the relationship -- a designated week, or month, or day, each year when both partners agree to take a break and live the single life for that time. They could run off to Vegas, or reconnect with an old flame, or simply realize they don't actually want anyone other than their partners after all. Yes, this could get tricky if you have children to care for. I admit, each of these few ideas has its own flaws, and none leaves us immune from the potential for jealousy or hurt. But they are choices that would be made between two partners, knowing that it is for the greater good of the relationship. And most importantly, they are choices that would be made jointly, with respect, realism, and above all, honesty. This path would certainly work a lot better than the ""Fingers Crossed it Doesn't Happen to My Relationship"" approach. For David and Holly Petraeus and the rest of us, too.Kate Schermerhorn is the director of ""After Happily Ever After,"" a documentary film about modern marriage. It is out now on DVD and On Demand.

3,DIVORCE,Remarrying Your Ex-Spouse,"Lois Tarter, Contributor

Should ex-spouses ever remarry? If you ask a recently divorced person this question, he or she will probably look at you like you have three heads. Ask them five years after a divorce and they still might look at you like you have three heads. However, it's been done before. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton remarried. Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner also remarried. Sometimes a couple forgets what drove them apart and concentrates on what brought them together in the first place. Here are six reasons why a divorced couple may become husband and wife all over again:Time Heals All Wounds: Time can certainly heal a lot of things and, in many cases, it may heal both former spouses' hearts. You may forget all of the things that you disliked about your ex and all you can remember is the good times. The Grass Wasn't Greener: As time passes, former spouses may realize that the grass wasn't greener on the other side. They then begin to stop dwelling on the negative things about their ex and start reflecting on the positive things. This can draw them closer to each other once again. Family Connection: Family and children can certainly bring two spouses back together again. They begin to see each other at school functions and at sporting events and start up a dialogue again. Celebrating children's accomplishments together may help bring them closer.Personal Growth: Sometimes two people feel that they need to grow a bit on their own in order to be fully committed to a marriage. As the saying goes, ""If I am not happy with myself, how can I be happy with anyone else?"" After spending some time apart and growing a bit more, they may be ready to be in a partnership again.Forgiveness: Forgiveness comes with time. If the two ex-spouses worked on themselves while apart and they are in a better place, they may be able to forgive their spouse for all that went wrong. Certainly, forgiving and getting back together are very different. However, if you feel that you could give it a go again together as a couple, forgiveness can play a major part in the two of you getting remarried again.Love Is Strong: While you may dislike your former spouse, deep down you may also still love them. Down the road, the dislike can dissipate and the love you have for them still can come back to the forefront. If you feel that things could work out again with your ex-spouse, don't ignore your feelings. Love can be a powerful thing in bringing two people back together again.

5,WEDDINGS,How To Be A Cool Bride,"Claudia Maittlen-Harris, Contributor
Writer, The Zeros Before the One",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-be-a-cool-bride_us_5b9c8364e4b03a1dcc7f593f,"There are some things to consider during the planning of a wedding that will keep brides cool -- as in calm and collected, and focused on creating an event that not only expresses who you are as a couple, but a fun, memorable night for your guests.",2012-11-14,Great looking models in formal dress with copy space.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c836424000050005339e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Weddings are ultimately a celebration of the love and commitment between two people. If a couple chooses to get married in a huge church with all the pomp and circumstance, in a Vegas chapel by an Elvis impersonator, or dressed as Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo (""Game of Thrones"" fan anyone?), then have at it. This isn't about a new, cool wedding trend you must try. What best fits her dreams, budget and happiness, is what each bride should choose. However, there are some things to consider during the planning of a wedding that will keep brides cool -- as in calm and collected, and focused on creating an event that not only expresses who you are as a couple, but a fun, memorable night for your guests.1. Remove the Words 'Perfect' and 'Princess' from Your VocabularyThose two words do more to undermine a bride and drive her insane than almost any other. Instead of thinking, ""My wedding day will be perfect"" try, ""My wedding day will be special."" Instead of, ""It's my day to be a princess"" try thinking, ""It's my day to feel absolutely beautiful."" Replacing those words will alleviate some of the stress of the day and help stop the bride from quickly becoming a Bridezilla. Why? No wedding is perfect, and all the ball gown-style wedding dresses and fake tiaras a woman may wear will never turn her into a princess. These words just create an unrealistic and unreachable goal for women. Amongst other things, weddings are a massive lesson in learning to roll with the punches. Sorry brides, but something will not go to plan on your wedding day. Mostly likely 99 percent of the plans will go smoothly, but having this absolute perfection looming in your mind will cause some insignificant slip up to turn her into a crying mess. It will probably be something small and manageable, but if brides set the bar unreachably high, they can't roll with the punches and enjoy their incredible day.2. Less Matchy-MatchyBrides excitedly discuss the 'theme' of their wedding, however one viewing of TLC's ""Four Weddings"" shows that a wedding ""theme"" can easily turn kitschy. Resist the urge to match everything (think Shelby's blush and bashful speech in ""Steel Magnolias""). While a clear idea is a great way to influence a bride's color scheme and decisions, it's wise to steer clear of overdoing a theme. A nautical theme sounds great but before you know it, there are sailboat-shaped party favors, a blue and white striped cake, blue and white striped bridesmaids dresses, blue and white striped chair covers, blue and white table runners, a blue belt on the bride's dress, and a dog walking down the aisle holding the rings in a mini sailboat -- you get the idea. Use a theme (be it a garden party, old Hollywood, the beach, etc.) to help guide the feel of the day but not overwhelm the overall look. In the words of ""Project Runway"" star Nina Garcia, learn to edit.3. Treat Your Bridesmaids Like the Wonderful, Beautiful Friends They AreThe tradition of bridesmaids dates back to Roman law when they needed 10 witnesses to fool evil spirits. Bridesmaids and groomsmen dressed identically to the bride and groom so the evil spirits wouldn't know who was getting married. We have come a long way from warding off evil spirits. Today a bridal party represents the friends and family who have had a major impact in the lives of the bride and groom. In essence, the bridesmaids represent the bride. So let them look good. Yes, bridesmaid dresses can be difficult. They are most often expensive, in a fabric most women rarely wear, and must fit different body types. No woman over the age of five wants to buy a full pink taffeta dress. So yes, choosing bridesmaid dresses has inherent challenges, but there are ways to let each bridesmaid be the unique woman she is. If one looks great with a blowout while another bridesmaid would rather wear an updo, that's cool. Making your friends look identical not only isn't it flattering, it's not modern. Your pictures aren't about capturing a blur of identical women; it is about capturing the women who have shaped your life. Matching lipstick, shoes, hair, etc. erases their individuality. There are no evil spirits out to sabotage weddings so there is no need to make the bridal party into identical-looking robots next to the bride. Individuality is always a cool element in a wedding.4. It's a ""We"" Day, Not a ""Me"" DaySince the bride does the majority of the planning and decision making for her wedding, it's understandable to take some ownership of that day. However, there wouldn't be a marriage without a couple. Every bride needs a groom (or another bride!), so remember to include your spouse-to-be and use the ""we"" pronoun. Not only is it inclusive of the person you will vow to love and honor for the rest of your life, it's also healthy and keeps the Bridezilla-spiral at bay. 5. Ask Yourself -- Will Anyone Remember This?Here's a little test. During your wedding planning process, ask your fiancé about the last wedding you attended together. Ask him what he thought of the chair covers, favors, centerpieces, escort cards, cake topper, etc. Most times, he won't remember any of these details, even if the bride spent hours selecting each one. Ask yourself, ""Will anyone remember this?"" It is a good barometer if you're stuck with a tough decision or something is going to cost much more than you originally budgeted. No one is suggesting you completely ignore the small details, but asking yourself about its overall importance helps when the caterer tries upselling colored napkins or chair covers. It also puts things in perspective if some of the details are driving you crazy. 6. EatLosing weight for the wedding is on almost every bride's agenda. However, skipping meals on the day of your wedding is a mistake. You won't really lose any more weight on the big day, so go ahead and eat some carbs. Even a big bowl of pasta at the rehearsal dinner is nothing a pair of Spanx can't handle on the wedding day. In fact, it's so easy to forget to eat on the wedding day that you should make sure to schedule in lunch. Delegate someone (like mom or a bridesmaid) to be in charge of making the bride eat. Brides need their stamina. Most likely they'll be in their dress and camera-ready hours before the wedding even starts. The adrenaline surging through her on that day makes food fuel, and an absolute necessity. If brides expect to make it through the day and the endless glasses of champagne that she'll be holding most of the night, a hearty meal early on is key. If you're nervous about your stomach looking bloated in the satin, sheath, bias-cut dress, then drink some healthy smoothies or load up on protein and veggies. Whatever you do, eat. No one wants to see a fainting bride, a drunken bride, or a bride crying so much because her nerves are so frayed -- all of which happen more easily on an empty stomach."
