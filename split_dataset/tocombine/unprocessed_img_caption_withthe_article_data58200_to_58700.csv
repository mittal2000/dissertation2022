He faces up to 40 years in prison. Sentencing is set for July 15.Simmons admitted that he defrauded the government in 2008 when he got work as a team leader in an Army program, and again in 2010 when he was deployed to Afghanistan as an intelligence adviser, the statement said.He said he made similar false statements in a 2009 bid to get work with the State Department's Worldwide Protective Service.Simmons also admitted to defrauding an unidentified woman out of $125,000 in a bogus real estate investment. When he was arrested, Simmons illegally possessed two firearms, which he was barred from having because of prior felonies, including a state conviction and two federal firearms violations."

To put that number in perspective, Durant's 49.2 points per 48 minutes lands him in between immortals Stephen Curry and Dwyane Wade, and ahead of LeBron James. Westbrook, meanwhile, averages 39.3 points per 48 minutes -- certainly a respectable clip, but nowhere near as efficient as Durant.Nor is scoring the only distinguishing factor between the two teammates. More important is Westbrook's robust turnover clip -- which nearly triples Durant's in clutch moments -- and his isolationist tendencies. While 42 percent of Durant's possessions lead to an assist, merely 7 percent of Westbrook's have the same result. We tend to think that Durant and Westbrook are six of one and half a dozen of the other, but it's simply not true, at least in terms of winning basketball.Former Thunder head coach Scott Brooks was well-liked, but his inability to deviate away from his two megastars down the stretch of games led to OKC's postseason woes against quality competition.

As great as Durant and Westbrook undoubtedly are, NBA defenses -- specifically the Warriors and Spurs -- are far too proficient at adjusting to bad offense.The defense, in turn, no longer has to shift or worry nearly as much about closing out other shooters, because only two guys are actually shooting the basketball.

3,POLITICS,Americans Are As Worried About Bad Water As Heroin,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drinking-water-poll_us_57239457e4b01a5ebde57fb8,The Flint water crisis has helped elevate the issue of unsafe water.,2016-04-29,"People rate unsafe drinking water as a top public health concern -- in Flint, Michigan the government failed to protect people from lead-tainted water, prompting a national outcry. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_9_314_4731_2670%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Contaminated drinking water ranks behind only cancer and heroin abuse as a serious health problem facing the U.S., according to a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.The poll asked whether people considered a range of health problems ""extremely serious."" Thirty-five percent felt that way about contaminated drinking water, the same percentage as for heroin abuse. The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, has focused national attention on the problem of aging water systems with crumbling pipes that deposit lead in people's drinking water. In Flint, the pipes crumbled extra quickly after the city started pumping water from the Flint River in April of 2014. Contrary to regulatory requirements, state regulators told city officials not to treat the water with anti-corrosion chemicals designed to reduce the amount of lead that leaches from pipes into the water.Research eventually showed higher blood lead levels in Flint children following the water switch. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) admitted the state made a terrible mistake, switched Flint back to Detroit's water system, and has remained a political piñata ever since.The Kaiser poll found 70 percent of Americans said this month that they've followed the Flint fallout closely, up from 63 percent in March. Liz Hamel, Kaiser's director of public opinion and survey research, told HuffPost that increased public attention toward Flint probably explains why people ranked contaminated water so highly on their list of public health concerns. ""I would guess at least part of the reason it ranked so highly is because of what's happening there,"" Hamel said. In the wake of the Flint crisis, many local water systems have had to assure customers that their water meets federal standards. The standards, it turns out, can be a little leaky -- the federal government didn't cite Flint for problems, for instance, before Snyder reconnected the city to Detroit's water in October. The water had been poisonous for 18 months -- and still is to this day.Arthur Delaney is a co-host of ""So, That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. This week's episode addressed the Flint water crisis in the 39th minute."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57227dd41900002d0056c93a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An initiative is assisting former inmates' transition into the community by teaching them to flourish in a bakery. The Beaverton Bakery in Oregon hires and trains ex-offenders, as part of its Second Chance Program, in an effort to curb recidivism. Since the bakery's initiative was started 10 years ago, it's hired more than 200 formerly incarcerated individuals through the program.And this past Wednesday, owner Carrie Ann Schubert was honored at the White House as a one of 10 ""Champions of Change,"" for her work in expanding fair chance opportunities.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 68 percent of released prisoners were arrested for a new crime within 3 years. That percentage jumps to almost 77 percent within 5 years. The bakery aims to help program participants beat those odds as well as help guide them into new lives after incarceration. ""We make them feel like they're part of the community and a lot of these [participants] haven't had that experience,"" Schubert, whose brother was incarcerated, told The Huffington Post. ""A lot of people weren't even given that first chance, much less a second chance."" Through the Second Chance Program, which launched in partnership with the Washington County Adult Drug Treatment Court, participants learn baking and life skills while making a living. Schubert says her staff also help participants find housing after they get out of halfway houses. Those in the program are able to work at the bakery for as long as they wish. She added that while the participants are employed at the bakery, it's crucial to comprehend their situations. ""You have to be very understanding because there's groups they have to go to, classes they have to take, their parole officer could ask them to come in for a drug test,"" she said. ""You need to be flexible with them ... so they can be able to work their own program as well as their job."" Of course, that doesn't mean it's a completely relaxed program. Schbubert also mentioned it's important for participants to stay on track. ""It's definitely a clean and sober program,"" she said, explaining that if she finds out about any substance abuse, the participant is ""out the door."" But the most important takeaway from the program, Schubert said, is confidence, which she hopes that the participants will bring with them wherever they go in life. ""What they want to gain when they come to work for us is the confidence that they can be something -- that they can learn a skill, they can make a living,"" she explained. ""As a community, we just try to do all of that and give them the confidence to know that there's another way to go other than where they came from.""Looking to the future, Schubert told HuffPost she plans to implement different kinds of training into the program, like teaching business skills."

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-roos-fbi-pipe-bomb_us_5723a97be4b01a5ebde593d4,"John Martin Roos, 61, repeatedly threatened to kill President Barack Obama in regular racist rants on Twitter and Facebook.",2016-04-29,Donald Trump supporter John Roos was arrested by the FBI after making racist threats about President Barack Obama.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5723ab551900002d0056cae6.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A fanatical Donald Trump supporter, who was arrested by the FBI in Oregon this week after repeatedly threatening to kill President Barack Obama and federal agents, had multiple pipe bombs in his home, authorities alleged in court on Friday.John Martin Roos, a 61-year-old from Oregon, has been charged with communication of a threat in interstate commerce, and additional charges are likely forthcoming. Roos first came onto the federal government's radar after a ""concerned citizen"" brought Roos' Facebook and Twitter postings to the FBI's attention in February, according to an affidavit from Special Agent Jeffrey Gray. (Excerpts, below, from Roos' postings contain explicit language.)In one Jan. 31 Facebook post cited by the FBI, Roos referred to agents as ""pussies"" and wrote he would ""snipe them with hunting rifles everywhere."" (Despite his threats to kill members of law enforcement, he also complained on Facebook earlier this month about the ""liberal media ... slamming police."") In a post in November that was also cited by the FBI, Roos spoke out against accepting refugees and threatened to kill Obama.""Obama you goat fffing fudgepacker, the refugees are men of fighting age. Black lives matter! Sure we need someone to pick cotton and wash cars. Paris, burn diseased muslim neighborhoods to the ground and start over with human beings. Obama you are on a hit list,"" he wrote in a post that appears to have been removed.Beyond what was mentioned in the affidavit, Roos regularly posted on both Facebook and Twitter about his support for Trump and his hatred for Obama, who he called a ""muslim faggot"" and other derogatory terms. He indicated he wanted to kill Obama's family and made other racist and sexist statements about Michelle Obama. He also made negative references to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, singer Beyonce, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and reporter Michelle Fields, and said he believed that the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was killed by Obama. He praised Ann Coulter and Stacey Dash, and posted several links to posts on Breitbart.com. He regularly posted about his support for Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate. In one post mentioned in court filings, Roos stated that he believed the establishment ""is trying to steal the election"" from Trump. ""All hail Donald Trump, the savior of America,"" he wrote on Christmas Eve. ""I'll bet he was born on Dec 25 just like Jesus.""When two FBI special agents visited him in March, Roos allegedly acknowledged making the postings on social media, calling the threats a way he ""blows off steam."" He said he didn't intend to harm anyone, but also that he would ""punch Obama in the nose"" if he had the chance.After a federal judge signed off on a search warrant, FBI agents searched Roos' home, where he lives with a roommate. According to the affidavit they found ""an AK-47 like firearm,"" a rifle and shotgun, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a .45 caliber Glock hidden under a couch cushion. Four pipe bombs were found in a white bucket next to Roos' computer workstation. Another weapon was found underneath the floor mat of his truck."

Ted Cruz “Lucifer in the flesh"" -- which would have been a scathing insult except for the fact that quite a few people had to look up the devil's lesser-known name.Searches for ""Lucifer"" spiked a whopping 7,700 percent since Thursday, according to Merriam-Webster Dictionary's ""Trends Watch."" The dictionary noted that the term commonly refers to Satan, as in John Milton's Paradise Lost, but also connotes ""light-bearing"" by its Latin roots. ""Although it is possible that Boehner was making a muted classical reference, and intended to characterize Cruz as a bearer of light, this seems unlikely,"" Merriam-Webster noted on its website.The former House speaker made the comments during an interview at Stanford University after he was asked about his thoughts on Cruz. Boehner compared the senator to Lucifer, the fallen saint, and said, “I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a b**ch in my life.”HuffPost reporter Sam Stein interviewed Lucien Greaves, a spokesperson for the Satanic Temple, on Thursday to establish the accuracy of Boehner's claim. “It is past time we stop blaming the activities of the upholders of the Christian faith on a Satanic philosophy,” Greaves told Stein. “Boehner is trying to convey that if it is bad and he disagrees with it, it is of Satan and Lucifer, and if it is of good, it is of Christ. That is what is problematic with the Christian ideology.”Perhaps next time Boehner should choose a less literary, more religiously-neutral way to insult Cruz."

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5723a68b1900002e0056cadb.jpeg?ops=crop_0_234_4928_2924%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi is flooding the Pentagon with requests for information and interviews that seem like an effort to unnecessarily prolong the investigation rather than extract useful facts, according to a top official at the Defense Department.Assistant Secretary of Defense Stephen Hedger expressed the department’s frustrations in a letter to committee chair Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) Thursday, saying his committee's demands are time-consuming, unrealistic and “encouraging speculation.”""The Department is working diligently to accommodate your staff's multiple and changing requests; however, we are concerned by the continuous threats from your staff to subpoena witnesses because we are not able to move quickly enough to accommodate these new requests,"" Hedger wrote. ""Subpoenaing our service members, when the Department is working diligently to accommodate your requests and when no service member has refused to appear voluntarily, is unfair to our uniformed men and women and an unproductive way forward."" One example of the committee's problematic requests is ""John from Iowa.""""John from Iowa"" called into the radio show of conservative host Sean Hannity in May 2013. He claimed he was a drone camera operator who saw what happened in Benghazi on the night of the attacks. He also complained that neither Congress nor the administration had interviewed him. Hedger said the Defense Department ""expended significant resources to locate anyone who might match the description of this person, to no avail."" But then committee staff expanded their request for officials to find all drone pilots and sensor operators who operated in the region that night -- a search Hedger called ""time-intensive,"" to say the least.""We continue to believe interviewing these individuals is unnecessary since we have given the Committee access to the relevant RPA [Remotely Piloted Aircraft] video from that night and it remains unclear that additional information could be gained from these interviews, especially the pilots,"" he added. In other words, whatever footage ""John from Iowa"" saw, the committee has probably already seen as well.Hedger also wrote that the department had provided the committee with 1,000 pages of documents, classified written answers to 20 questions, 10 classified briefings and transcribed interviews with at least seven individuals. A Benghazi committee spokesman told ABC News that Hedger's letter was ""further proof the Benghazi Committee is conducting a thorough, fact-centered investigation” and talking to people who weren't part of previous investigations.""It's unfortunate it took the threat of subpoenas for the Pentagon to make witnesses available earlier this year. This delayed the committee from learning a tremendous amount of new information from several witnesses,"" committee spokesman Matt Wolking said. The committee formed in 2014 to look into the 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Most notably, Hillary Clinton testified before the committee for 11 hours in October in a hearing where Republicans seemed more interested in the politics behind her use of a private email server as secretary of state rather than the Benghazi attacks. There have already been seven other congressional investigations into the incident, and none of them have found any deliberate wrongdoing by the administration. Gowdy said he wants to produce a final report ""before summer.""Hedger said the Pentagon also objected to the nature of some of the committee's interviews, because interviewees ""have been asked repeatedly to speculate or engage in discussing on the record hypotheticals posed by Committee Members and staff, regardless of the interviewee's actual knowledge or expertise to provide appropriate analysis or insight.""""This type of questioning poses the risk that your final report may be based on speculation,"" he added, ""rather than a fact-based analysis of what a military officer did do or could have done given his or her knowledge at the time of the attacks.""

10,ENTERTAINMENT,Geena Davis Suggests One Very Good Reason To Make Diverse Entertainment,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/geena-davis-gender-balance-hollywood_us_57222d20e4b01a5ebde4b2f8,Money.

Basically, people believe they know what works. (Also: nepotism.) But, film after film, what they believe ""works"" turns out to be a homogenous spread of characters that fit a very male and white mold.A common criticism of those calling for gender- and race-balanced shows is that they ignore the harsh, but undeniable, reality of Hollywood studios: that they are businesses, not activists. And, like most businesses, they follow proven ways to earn income.Actress Geena Davis has made it her mission to prove balanced entertainment doesn't ignore anything: Yes, people want to watch women and people of color on screen; no, doing so does not add any sort of ""message""; And, yes, Hollywood can still profit handsomely. She helped establish the Bentonville Film Festival last year to promote entertainment that doesn't fit that typical white and male mold -- but still draws eyeballs. ""We don’t want to just say, ‘Here’s some nice movies made by some diverse people,’"" Davis told The Huffington Post, ""But, ‘These are commercial. It’s just a way to make money.’"" Independent reports have supported her claim. The past three Hollywood Diversity reports from the Ralph J. Bunche Center at UCLA concluded that relatively diverse casting -- films with 21 to 50 percent racial minorities and TV shows with 41 to 50 percent racial minorities -- leads to higher box-office revenue and ratings. A 2013 FiveThirtyEight report concluded that films passing the Bechdel test -- a litmus test for developed women characters -- earned the highest return on investment in domestic and international markets. (Even a layman looking around at popular movie titles can see that women-led fare is frequently a major box-office hit.)But even if they can draw people to theaters or laptop screens -- Netflix and Amazon snapped up all kinds of distribution rights at the Sundance Film Festival in January -- are diverse shows sending a ""message"" specifically against white males? That question comes up most often when Davis talks about kids' media with studios and creators, she told HuffPost. She always has an answer.""I say, ‘Well, I believe that. I don’t want you to have a message in kids’ entertainment. It doesn’t need it,'"" Davis said. ""'But you should know there is a very powerful negative message in what you’re doing now, because if you’re saying that girls are less important -- they take up less space in the world, they don’t do half of the interesting things -- that’s a message. And it’s a very powerful negative message that gives everybody an unconscious bias.'""Everybody -- including international audiences, which some industry executives believe to be less tolerant of diverse casting.""Having a diverse cast creates another hurdle for U.S. series trying to break through; it would be foolish not to recognize that,"" a Fox executive told The Hollywood Reporter in March. To that, Davis also has a response.""I think we’ve probably trained people to expect to see white, male characters. So if there’s resistance, globally, it’s probably something we’ve created,"" she said. The U.S. is, indeed, home to the largest media companies in the world.Aiming to grant audiences more varied characters and stories, Davis' Bentonville Film Festival will draw representation from all major studios to show feature films and documentaries about women, girls and people of color, starring such actors as Susan Sarandon, Mae Whitman, Retta, Debra Messing and David Oyelowo.The festival opens May 3 with ""Equity,"" a drama about women caught up in Wall Street starring Anna Gunn, and closes May 8."

More than 32,000 adult patients and 45,000 ER visits were included. The study did not include patients with psychiatric or substance-related complaints, those who were nonverbal or had altered mental status, and those with a history of frequent ER visits.Almost 3,000 patients had limited English proficiency, and in about half of cases someone served as an interpreter. Usually, this was a family member or an ER staff member. Only 527 visits in this group, 24 percent, involved a professional interpreter.More than a quarter of patients were admitted to the hospital and 1,380 patients had an unplanned return to the ER within three days.After accounting for age, sex, insurance, race, ethnicity, triage category and other health problems, having limited English proficiency was not tied to greater risk of being admitted to the hospital.But those with limited English proficiency were about 24 percent more likely to return to the ER unexpectedly.Ngai did not respond to a request for comment.“This is a really important population to study and think about how we can improve their care,” Jacobs said. A 5 percent rather than 4 percent rate of return to the ER is not a large difference, but that could be due to the large number of patients excluded from the study, and because there was no validated measure of English proficiency, Jacobs said. “That might be why we didn’t see large differences, if some people considered low English proficiency actually spoke English well, or were getting good interpretive services,” she said. “If you took them out, the difference might be larger.”Patients who do not speak English may struggle in other areas of the health system more than at the ER, she added.But even having an interpreter at the hospital won’t help patients deal with insurance providers, she noted.“There are contextual issues that you may not be able to fully adequately address unless you can understand the nuances,” Jacobs said.People with low English proficiency may also be less able to take days off of work, and to agree to be admitted to the hospital when necessary, than others, she said.“We’ve made tremendous progress in assuring interpreters are more available,” in person, over the phone or by video, Jacobs said.But, she said, “we are very imperfect at getting patients the services they need. It’s important for providers to be educated on these issues and to understand how to access these services.”SOURCE: bit.ly/1XWbkJT Annals of Emergency Medicine, online March 29, 2016."

The app lets users connect directly with partnering nonprofits through push notifications that stand out in the flood of communication on mobile devices. The key is that users can select which organizations can send them updates and which ones cannot. If a nonprofit needs volunteers for an upcoming event, for example, it can send out a push reminder to its followers.Nonprofits have the increasingly difficult task of reaching donors through the clutter of social media notifications and emails. McHale told the Boston Globe that email open and response rates went down in 2015, according to a M&R Benchmarks study.""[The app] pulls out all that doing-good that's buried in your inbox or buried in your Twitter feed or buried in your Facebook feed and puts it right in front of you,"" McHale told Business News Network.The app targets its mobile market in a more direct way than email. This seems to be a valid choice, as 65 percent of nonprofit social media happens on mobile, and 41 percent of donors with a smartphone are willing to make financial transactions on mobile, a recent Mobile Cause study found. Currently, LetsAllDoGood is partnered with 10 Boston-area organizations. However, McHale hopes to eventually open the platform to any nonprofit or charitable organization in the future.

Just 8 percent of Sanders supporters said they would vote for Trump as their second choice, roughly the same as the portion of voters who listed Trump's Republican rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich as their second choice.Sanders supporter Joseph Hayes, 37, of Oregon, still has hope for his candidate. But if it comes down to Trump or Clinton, Hayes said it was an easy, if unpleasant, choice.""I would have to vote for Hillary. Reluctantly so, but I would,"" he said.People who outwardly back both Sanders and Trump are even more of a rarity. Donor rolls show just over two dozen voters willing to support both Trump and Sanders financially.“I think Bernie Sanders is too poor to be bought, and I think Donald Trump is too rich to be bought by special interests,” said Royce Gourley, a real estate investor, who gave $2,500 to Sanders and $2,700 to Trump, Federal Election Commission filings show.OUTSIDER APPEALBut Trump could find an opening as both he and Sanders have gained strong followings among voters looking for an outsider candidate who will shake up the Washington establishment.Both have made significant inroads among laborers and union members who support their opposition to U.S. trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which critics say threaten U.S. jobs.But the two are far apart on many issues, especially immigration. Trump has proposed building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country.Sanders has called such proposals ""crap"" and often criticizes what he calls ""inhumane"" deportation programs.For Sanders supporters like Dave Berry, 62, of Tacoma, Washington, the wooing may pay off as voters weigh the decision to stick with their party or stir things up in Washington.""I will probably put a check in Trump's column (in the general election),"" Berry said of a possible Trump-Clinton general election contest.He said he did not think the former reality TV star could win, but felt good about making Clinton uneasy about her prospects of securing an easy win.One risk for Clinton is Sanders voters who may sit out the election or choose a third-party candidate if their favorite is not on the ballot.Valerie Benson, 80, of Cleveland, said that if it came down to Trump against Clinton, ""I don't know that I would vote for anybody then.""(Editing by Caren Bohan and Peter Cooney)"

Among the forms of identification accepted under the contested Texas law are a driver's license, a military ID, a U.S. passport and a license to carry a handgun.The Campaign Legal Center, an advocacy group that filed the current request to the Supreme Court, was pleased with Friday's development.“This order gives us the opportunity to protect Texas voters if the 5th Circuit fails to rule in time,” Gerry Hebert, the group's executive director, said in a statement.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), for his part, appeared ready for the next legal showdown.“We appreciate the Supreme Court allowing the law to remain in effect at this time and look forward to defending the merits of our case in front of the entire Fifth Circuit next month,"" he said in a statement.Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, argued in a blog post that rather than being a straight win for one side or the other, the Supreme Court's move is simply an attempt to put the otherwise conservative 5th Circuit on a firm schedule.The Supreme Court's guidance ""prevents not only dawdling but intentional foot-dragging so as to allow the law to remain in effect for the November election,"" Hasen wrote.The last time the justices stepped in and allowed the law to go into effect, ahead of the 2014 elections, the three women on the court, led by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, issued a warning about the law's potential impact.“The greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters,” Ginsburg wrote."

But a speech he gave yesterday shows that if anything, Sanders is broadening his attacks on the party even as his chances of getting the nomination narrow.At a rally in Springfield, the independent senator from Vermont suggested Democrats have fallen short of their ideals and that low turnout in midterm elections can be attributed to the party's aligning itself with special interests. His comments were in line with what he began to say late last month, which is that if he doesn’t win the nomination he still will try to “completely revitalize the Democratic Party.”“Are we on the side of working people or big-money interests? Do we stand with the elderly, the sick and the poor or do we stand with Wall Street speculators and the insurance companies?” he asked Thursday. “You can’t be for Wall Street and the working people of this country. You cannot be for the drug companies and senior citizens and veterans. You cannot be on the side of workers and support those corporations that have thrown millions on the street.”Sanders has tended to criticize ""establishment politics"" in past campaign appearances, but his rally Friday was most more explicitly aimed at Democrats.“The problem, in my view, is not that the Republicans are winning elections. It’s that Democrats are losing elections,” he said.While Democrats have passed laws to make voting more accessible and sued to block laws passed by Republicans that make voting more challenging, Sanders argued the party has not pushed strongly enough for election reforms that, as his campaign’s press release after the rally said, “would increase voter turnout and help Democrats win elections."" (Democrats who push to broaden voting access don't tend to say they're doing it to benefit their party.)Sanders criticized the Democratic primary process. He has won primaries that were open to independents, like Michigan's, but struggled in primaries that were closed to unaffiliated voters, like New York's.“Republican governors want to make it harder to vote,” he said. “Our job is to bring more people into the system.” Clinton leads Sanders by over 800 delegates, if one counts superdelegates, or by nearly 330 pledged delegates. But Sanders’ campaign has suggested that it could persuade superdelegates backing Clinton to switch sides by pointing to polling matchups where the senator performs better against Republicans. While Sanders has said that he would support Clinton if she is the Democrats’ nominee, he has also said that it is her job to win over his supporters, not his. His speech Thursday indicated that he isn't giving up any of his bargaining chips ahead of the Democratic convention. His supporters want him to push to make the party's platform more progressive and for the party to change its nomination process.“I think Secretary Clinton and I agree that we must not have a Republican in the White House but I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are looking at the strongest Democratic candidate,” he said. “And the reason for that is that our campaign is able to reach beyond the Democratic base and win the support of millions of independents."""
16,BUSINESS,Why Your Fancy Banking App Isn't Helping You Budget Better,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/banking-app-budget_us_57238b0be4b0f309baf0b226,We’re still waiting for the app that stops real incomes from falling.,2016-04-29,"This is a stock photo. In real life, this guy is probably amazing at budgets.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57238c062200003600254fb5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the promises of online banking is that you can get an app to do your budgeting for you. It's something that feels necessary in a post-Great Recession world: Real household incomes have been falling over the last decade and a half, and people have to keep track of their money because they have less to spend than they once did.The idea is that by tracking your spending, you can avoid the kind of profligacy that leads to budget downfall. Unfortunately for most Americans, budgeting isn't really the problem.Keeping track of every happy hour drink may help on the margins, but for most people, financial problems are caused by things like losing a job or getting sick. The real problem is not that you aren't budgeting -- it's that the costs of housing, college and health care have skyrocketed in the last 50 years. No app can keep you from overspending on rent, needing to pay back student loans or medical debt, or suffering through bouts of unemployment.That hasn't stopped banks from trying.Ally Bank’s new app, Splurge Alert, is sort of like a reverse-Yelp. It uses geolocation to alert people when they're approaching stores and restaurants where they tend to spend money unnecessarily. Warning! You're entering a high-spending zone! In the promotional video, Drew Scott, the co-star of popular HGTV show ""Property Brothers,"" admits to a bad habit of buying antique swords. (""I’m not a violent person,"" he says. ""I just like deadly medieval weapons."")It’s an interesting take on budgeting gamification. But who, exactly, is this helping? ""I can imagine a very limited set of situations where this kind of thing might be helpful,"" said Abigail Sussman, a marketing professor at the University of Chicago who studies how people make purchasing decisions. She said this approach might be useful if a person already knows they have a problem with a particular type of spending, and they're making a conscious effort to steer clear of it. But when it comes to specific harmful spending habits, this kind of self-awareness is actually pretty rare.There are more broadly helpful versions of mobile banking. Citi, for example, lets its customers see basic details about how much money is in their checking account on the app homepage, without signing in. Simple, an online bank that prides itself on customer service, has a proprietary tool called ""safe-to-spend,"" which shows you how much discretionary cash there is in your account, automatically subtracting the money you spend regularly on things like rent and utilities.But again, that kind of thing only helps with a small percentage of irregular purchases. There's a story in The Atlantic this month about a man -- a film critic -- who barely has two pennies to rub together, despite all the outward signals of being well off. He owns a house, has published many books and is well-known as a writer. He has a child who went to Harvard Medical School. But, he explains, he and his wife have no retirement funds and no savings as a result of a little bit of bad luck, and some very poor choices on his part.Would any of these apps help this man? Probably not. His problem is his lifestyle, not his day-to-day spending. He was paying two mortgages for several years because he and his family moved during a market downturn -- in Brooklyn and East Hampton, no less, two of the most expensive housing markets in the country. His wife quit her job when their children were young, then had trouble finding her way back into the workforce. They sent their children to private school. Almost no amount of restaurant-splurging stacks up against years of five-figure private school tuition. As part of the app’s launch, Ally commissioned a third-party online survey by Harris Poll on people’s splurging habits. While 85 percent of people said that they occasionally splurge on things, only 7 percent said they do it once a month or more. The most common splurges by far fell into the “food and drink” or “clothes and shoes” categories, both of which usually end up being relatively small amounts of money compared to, say, rent. Meanwhile, a recent report by the Federal Reserve showed that 47 percent of Americans say they don’t have $400 to spare in an emergency, suggesting that splurging isn’t the big problem for most people’s budgets. In a 2012 paper on what motivates consumer spending, sociologist Jeff Lundy found that splurging on things like clothes and restaurants is usually a sign that a person is accumulating wealth, rather than the opposite. “The best predictors of both wealth losses and reduced wealth accumulation were adverse circumstances which tend to overwhelm a household’s budget,” the paper says. And no app can bring back the erosion of Americans' incomes since 1999. But that app certainly would be cool.Would you like to improve your relationship with money?

Tests of seven popular cranberry-pill brands in the U.S. showed that most contained too little of the key bacteria-fighting ingredient to have any effect. “There is a lot of variability in quality and efficacy of cranberry supplements, making it difficult for consumers to know which ones will work for them,” said lead author Dr. Bilal Chughtai, assistant professor of urology at Weil Cornell Medical College in New York.UTIs affect some 8 million people each year in the U.S. Approximately half of all women will experience one at some point, Chughtai and his colleagues write in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.UTIs are caused by bacteria and usually treated with antibiotics, but antibiotic overuse and resistance are problematic, so finding effective ways to prevent UTIs is important, the authors write.Cranberry juice and supplements have long been used to stave off UTIs. They were once thought to prevent the infections by affecting the acidity of urine, the researchers note.More recent investigations show that cranberries or cranberry juice may actually work because they contain proanthocyanidins – antioxidant “flavonoids” like those found in blueberries, grape seeds and chocolate - which also prevent bacteria from sticking to the bladder wall.Past studies have shown that to prevent recurrent UTIs, cranberry products need to contain a dose of at least 36 milligrams of proanthocyanidins per day, the researchers note.Herbal medications like cranberry supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and so many brands may not contain the needed amount of proanthocyanidins or even any at all, Chughtai told Reuters Health by email.He and his colleagues analyzed seven over-the-counter cranberry supplements, testing each product in cultures of bacteria and red blood cells to see how effectively it prevented bacterial growth.Only one supplement studied contained more than the needed amount of proanthocyanidins, with 175 mg of the compounds per gram of product. That supplement also prevented bacterial growth in culture.Another supplement contained 25 mg/g of proanthocyanidins and also showed activity against the bacteria, while the other four supplements contained less than 5 mg/g of proanthocyanidins and had no effects against the bacteria.The report does not identify the brands.Chughtai noted that cranberry powders may be made from dried juice or from dried skins left over from the juicing process. Supplements made from juice act much faster and are more effective than those made from skins, he said.“But since supplement manufacturers are not required to list which parts of the cranberry are in the supplement, all forms of powdered supplements (whether from juice or skins) are able to call themselves ‘cranberry’,” Chughtai said. ""Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common, particularly in women, and result in major costs related to antibiotic use, hospitalizations as well as time lost from work,"" said Dr. Deborah Wing, a gynecology professor at University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. ""Approaches to either prevent or treat UTIs which are based on use of food products could reduce some health care costs and minimize human pain and suffering,"" Wing told Reuters Health by email.Overall, Wing said, cranberry may be better for prevention than for treatment. To treat a UTI, she said, people should consume cranberry products daily and in frequent doses throughout the day, which may be very hard to do.She also noted that other compounds in cranberries might work with proanthocyanidins to treat UTIs. For this reason, it may be more effective to take supplements made from cranberry juice rather than other extracts.SOURCE: bit.ly/1Nb4a3H American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, online April 5, 2016.

23,POLITICS,U.S. Military Investigates And Finds Itself Not Guilty Of War Crimes In Afghan Hospital Bombing,Jessica Schulberg and Sophia Jones,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-not-guilty-war-crimes-kunduz-hospital_us_57236ddfe4b0b49df6ab0ada,The Pentagon says it didn't intend to kill 42 people.,2016-04-29,"The Doctors Without Borders trauma center was in flames after U.S. airstrikes hit it on Oct. 3, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said on Friday that its attack on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, last October was not a war crime because the attack was not intentional. The military released a redacted 3,000-page internal investigation into the deadly bombing, which destroyed the only free trauma center of its kind in the country’s northern region and killed 42 patients, staffers and caretakers.“The label ‘war crimes’ is typically reserved for intentional acts,” Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command, said on Friday. “The investigation found that the tragic incident resulted from a combination of unintentional human errors and equipment failures, and that none of the personnel knew that they were striking a medical facility.”Votel specifically cited battlefield fatigue, following several consecutive days of fighting after Taliban forces had taken over the strategic city of Kunduz, and technological issues, which compromised the AC-130 gunship’s GPS sensors and video transmitters used to locate targets. A combination of these factors, he said, led U.S. troops to repeatedly bomb the hospital instead of their intended target, a building 400 meters away.The military said it punished 16 unnamed service members for mistakes that led to the airstrikes that destroyed most of the hospital. Five of the 16 individuals were removed from Afghanistan. Other disciplinary action included suspension and removal from command, letters of reprimand, counseling, and retraining.Doctors Without Borders slammed the ""administrative punishments"" as ""out of proportion to the destruction of a protected medical facility, the deaths of 42 people, the wounding of dozens of others, and the total loss of vital medical services to hundreds of thousands of people.""""The lack of meaningful accountability sends a worrying signal to warring parties, and is unlikely to act as a deterrent against future violations of the rules of war,"" the medical humanitarian agency said in a statement shortly after the Pentagon's announcement.Since the October attack, the military has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from happening in the future, said Votel. They gave the leadership of Doctors Without Borders -- also known as Médecins Sans Frontières or MSF -- better contact information to reach U.S. forces, provided 9,000 personnel with additional training on the rules of engagement, and moved to pre-load aircraft computers with the no-strike list, which included the Kunduz hospital. (The AC-130 crew involved in the October attack didn’t have the list, due to an early takeoff.)Throughout the press briefing on Friday, Votel repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. did not intentionally bomb the Doctors Without Borders facility -- possibly an effort to quash rumors circling in Afghanistan that the military knowingly targeted the hospital because some of the patients there were Taliban soldiers.But intent is not the only consideration in determining whether a military attack is within the laws of war. International law also prohibits “recklessly” launching attacks.“Under laws of war, you have to take feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians,” Naureen Shah, director of Amnesty International’s Security With Human Rights program, told The WorldPost. “They have acknowledged all of these mistakes -- that there were so many things they could have done to prevent this from happening,” she continued. “Twenty-nine minutes of bombing a hospital and no one notices that the wrong building is being bombed -- if that’s not recklessness, I don’t know what is.”The Pentagon’s investigation leaves unanswered several questions about what happened during the Oct. 3, 2015, attack and why it took the military so long to realize its mistake.In November, Gen. John F. Campbell, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told reporters that the military realized its mistake less than a half hour into the bombing, after receiving a phone call from Doctors Without Borders, and halted the attack. But the humanitarian agency, which compiled a detailed log of phone calls made during the airstrikes, has said the bombing dragged on for at least an hour, despite multiple calls to U.S. and Afghan contacts. Surviving patients, staffers present that night and local Kunduz residents confirmed the agency’s timeline in interviews with The WorldPost.Doctors Without Borders, which accepts patients from all warring sides but prohibits them from bringing weapons inside its facilities, said it was treating about 20 Taliban patients at the time of the attack.Some Afghan government officials defended the attack, which only added to speculation that Afghan forces had intended for the U.S. troops to hit the hospital and its Taliban patients.“That was a time of fighting — some things happen,” Hamdullah Danishi, acting governor of Kunduz, told The WorldPost in February. “I know the Taliban. They are using everywhere as bases. I cannot say if [the hospital] was a military base or not. But they were there, 100 percent.”President Barack Obama and the U.S. military have ignored repeated calls from Doctors Without Borders for an outside investigation into the attack, which the organization has described as a war crime. Gen. Campbell told reporters in November that the U.S. investigation, as well as a NATO and joint U.S.-Afghan assessment, would provide a “thorough and unbiased inquiry.”Gen. Votel said on Friday that the officers who conducted the investigation visited the site of the attack in Afghanistan and interviewed more than 65 witnesses. Those officers were selected, he said, because they came from assignments outside Afghanistan and could provide an “objective and independent perspective.”But Shah, of Amnesty International, rejected the idea that an internal military investigation could produce unbiased results. “We can’t trust an investigation by the U.S. military because you should never ask an entity to just merely police itself,” she said.The military has allocated $5.7 million to rebuild that hospital and made “condolence payments” to Afghans directly affected by the strikes, Votel said Friday. Over 170 such payments have been made, he said, in sums of $3,000 for those wounded in the attack and $6,000 to families of those killed.Recipients of condolence payments have told The WorldPost they received similar amounts. One father, who watched in horror as his 9-year-old daughter burned alive in her hospital bed during the attack, said the cash was hardly enough to replace his dead child.Doctors Without Borders has said it does not plan to rebuild or reopen the Kunduz hospital until all warring parties will ensure the safety of its staffers and patients. “We need assurances that we can work according to our core principles and international law,” a spokesperson for the group told The WorldPost last month. “Namely that we can safely treat all people in need, no matter who they are or for which side they fight.""Without the 92-bed medical clinic in Kunduz that treated Afghans for free, people in need of emergency care in northern Afghanistan are forced to choose between local medical care that many residents say they can't afford or is unreliable, or risk the hours-long haul to Kabul. There, the Italian-run Emergency hospital treats war-wounded for free. For patients who have lost limbs in mine explosions or suffered critical injuries in firefights, those 200 or so miles from Kunduz to Kabul could be the difference between life and death.Jessica Schulberg reported from Washington and Sophia Jones reported from Istanbul.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Doctors Without Borders was treating 65 Taliban patients at the time of the attack. It treated that number of Taliban patients the Wednesday before the bombing."

You noticed the media forgot all about another story’s basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.People are starving in the Iraqi city of Fallujah because the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS, won’t let them leave -- and Iraqi forces surrounding the city aren't letting supplies in.Between 30,000 and 60,000 civilians have been trapped inside Fallujah since Iraqi troops and militiamen encircled the ISIS-occupied city in January, humanitarian groups say. Since then, shops and markets have run out of basic food supplies, cooking gas and fuel are nonexistent, and electricity only works a few hours a day, the World Food Programme said earlier this month. The price of wheat has skyrocketed sixfold since December. ""For the past several months, it has been very difficult to get supplies into Fallujah, especially medicines and food,"" Lise Grande, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, told The WorldPost. ""If you are poor, you can't afford to buy food anymore. The situation is deeply worrying.""The lack of food and medicine in the city has killed some 140 people, an Iraqi official told Human Rights Watch earlier this month, although this figure has not been confirmed. Activists told the group that Fallujah residents had resorted to eating soup made from grass. ""There is no food inside Fallujah, except some vegetables grown in agricultural areas on the outskirts of the city,” an Iraqi activist who asked to remain anonymous told The WorldPost via the Facebook solidarity page ""We are all Fallujah.""“Some diabetes patients have lost body parts due to lack of treatment,” the activist said. Fallujah, once home to 300,000 Iraqis, is a key battleground in Iraq’s push to recapture territory lost to the Islamic State since 2014.The city was a stronghold of the Islamic State’s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq. In January 2014, it became the first major Iraqi city the Islamic State captured as it rampaged through Iraq and Syria.Iraqi troops and allied militias began to turn the tide against the militant group, recapturing the nearby city of Ramadi last December. They encircled Fallujah in January as part of the slowly progressing offensive against the extremists. The role of Shiite militias is particularly controversial -- experts say their abuses against Sunni civilians could undermine Sunni support for the fight against the Islamic State as well as the national reconciliation necessary for a lasting peace in Iraq.As the siege on Fallujah intensified in February, Sunni tribesmen fed up with the Islamic State’s brutal rule and worsening conditions in the city rose up against the militant group, but ISIS crushed the rebellion.Islamic State militants have the city on lockdown, and human rights groups say they have executed civilians who try to leave. Fallujah residents told The New York Times that anyone caught talking on a cell phone was subject to scrutiny and possible arrest.U.S. troops and advisors are backing Iraq's offensive, and U.S. President Barack Obama recently authorized more troops to join the fight against the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria. Vice President Joe Biden visited the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Thursday, just 40 miles east of besieged Fallujah. Asked if the U.S. was comfortable with Iraq’s siege tactics on Fallujah, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said this week that the government in Baghdad is “dealing with a very difficult situation.”“Trying to root out ISIL fighters is, of course, going to have a negative impact on the local population,” Earnest told reporters, using another acronym for the Islamic State. Iraq’s government assured the U.N. last month that its forces will allow emergency supplies into the city and facilitate civilians' escape. Since then, Iraqi forces have helped evacuate 13 families from the city, many of them with acute medical needs, the U.N.'s Grande said.Yet, tens of thousands of people remain trapped without a safe route out of Fallujah, and supplies are still not reaching the city. Iraqi militia leaders defended their siege as a military necessity in a New York Times interview. Iraqi and U.S. military officials have rejected a proposal to air drop supplies to the city, fearing they would fall into Islamic State hands.""The situation is really tragic, with the full meaning of the word 'tragic,'"" the city’s exiled mayor, Eissa al Issawi, told The Washington Post. ""The people of Fallujah are dying a slow death."""

Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.People are starving in the Iraqi city of Fallujah because the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS, won’t let them leave -- and Iraqi forces surrounding the city aren't letting supplies in.Between 30,000 and 60,000 civilians have been trapped inside Fallujah since Iraqi troops and militiamen encircled the ISIS-occupied city in January, humanitarian groups say. Since then, shops and markets have run out of basic food supplies, cooking gas and fuel are nonexistent, and electricity only works a few hours a day, the World Food Programme said earlier this month. The price of wheat has skyrocketed sixfold since December. ""For the past several months, it has been very difficult to get supplies into Fallujah, especially medicines and food,"" Lise Grande, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, told The WorldPost. ""If you are poor, you can't afford to buy food anymore. The situation is deeply worrying.""The lack of food and medicine in the city has killed some 140 people, an Iraqi official told Human Rights Watch earlier this month, although this figure has not been confirmed. Activists told the group that Fallujah residents had resorted to eating soup made from grass. ""There is no food inside Fallujah, except some vegetables grown in agricultural areas on the outskirts of the city,” an Iraqi activist who asked to remain anonymous told The WorldPost via the Facebook solidarity page ""We are all Fallujah.""“Some diabetes patients have lost body parts due to lack of treatment,” the activist said. Fallujah, once home to 300,000 Iraqis, is a key battleground in Iraq’s push to recapture territory lost to the Islamic State since 2014.The city was a stronghold of the Islamic State’s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq. In January 2014, it became the first major Iraqi city the Islamic State captured as it rampaged through Iraq and Syria.Iraqi troops and allied militias began to turn the tide against the militant group, recapturing the nearby city of Ramadi last December. They encircled Fallujah in January as part of the slowly progressing offensive against the extremists. The role of Shiite militias is particularly controversial -- experts say their abuses against Sunni civilians could undermine Sunni support for the fight against the Islamic State as well as the national reconciliation necessary for a lasting peace in Iraq.As the siege on Fallujah intensified in February, Sunni tribesmen fed up with the Islamic State’s brutal rule and worsening conditions in the city rose up against the militant group, but ISIS crushed the rebellion.Islamic State militants have the city on lockdown, and human rights groups say they have executed civilians who try to leave. Fallujah residents told The New York Times that anyone caught talking on a cell phone was subject to scrutiny and possible arrest.U.S. troops and advisors are backing Iraq's offensive, and U.S. President Barack Obama recently authorized more troops to join the fight against the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria. Vice President Joe Biden visited the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Thursday, just 40 miles east of besieged Fallujah. Asked if the U.S. was comfortable with Iraq’s siege tactics on Fallujah, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said this week that the government in Baghdad is “dealing with a very difficult situation.”“Trying to root out ISIL fighters is, of course, going to have a negative impact on the local population,” Earnest told reporters, using another acronym for the Islamic State. Iraq’s government assured the U.N. last month that its forces will allow emergency supplies into the city and facilitate civilians' escape. Since then, Iraqi forces have helped evacuate 13 families from the city, many of them with acute medical needs, the U.N.'s Grande said.Yet, tens of thousands of people remain trapped without a safe route out of Fallujah, and supplies are still not reaching the city. Iraqi militia leaders defended their siege as a military necessity in a New York Times interview. Iraqi and U.S. military officials have rejected a proposal to air drop supplies to the city, fearing they would fall into Islamic State hands.""The situation is really tragic, with the full meaning of the word 'tragic,'"" the city’s exiled mayor, Eissa al Issawi, told The Washington Post. ""The people of Fallujah are dying a slow death."""

29,POLITICS,Criminal Justice Reform Bill Moves Forward In The Senate,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-criminal-justice-reform-bill_us_572275bde4b0f309baf05346,"After months of stalling, Senators released a revised version of the bill.",2016-04-28,"Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), flanked by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), left, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) at a meeting on Capitol Hill. The three helped author a criminal justice reform bill that now has bipartisan support.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Efforts to reform the country’s strict sentencing laws aren’t dead in Congress just yet. A bipartisan group of senior senators revealed revisions Thursday to legislation that would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders and give judges greater discretion on sentencing for low-level drug crimes. The changes prevent violent criminals from qualifying for reduced sentencing options. However, they also expand provisions for low-level offenders, meaning more of them will benefit from the legislation and the total number of people affected will remain roughly the same as under the original bill.The revisions also ensure that inmates convicted under the Armed Career Criminal Act will not be able to qualify for reduced sentences, while boosting mandatory sentences for offenses involving the opioid fentanyl, which is tied to drug overdoses and deaths. As the authors intended, the tweaks convinced more Republicans to back the controversial bill. Without strong support within the GOP conference, Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) won’t be able to get the legislation to the floor for a vote. As of Thursday, four additional Republican senators joined -- Sens. Mark Kirk (Ill.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), and Dan Sullivan (Alaska) -- giving the bill 37 co-sponsors.The task now is to continue wooing more members of the GOP conference and convince Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that if he brings the package to the floor, it will have enough support to pass with 60 votes. “I think it’s time for those discussions to start right now,” Grassley said of approaching McConnell with the new text and cosponsors. “Mitch McConnell has been waiting for a signal from the Republican side that they’re ready for the bill; I think today we have a signal,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who helped author the bill. “We’re going to plead with him to put us on the agenda and try to move this as quickly as we can.” Durbin stressed that the bill can pass the upper chamber with a majority of Democrats and Republicans backing it. “This is the best chance in a generation to reform our federal drug sentencing laws,” he said. Still, the bill's fragility was lost on no one. To keep the package together, Senate Judiciary Committee leadership continued “breathing life into it again though various tribulations,” committee member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said. And alterations to the bill are unlikely to win over its harshest Republican critics -- namely, Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Jeff Sessions (Ala.) and Cornyn’s fellow Texan, GOP hopeful Ted Cruz, who all argue that a reduction in mandatory minimums would make communities less safe. Cotton immediately attacked the changes, saying the “revised bill only raises more serious questions.” Sessions questioned whether the bill would “send a message to judges and prosecutors that we’re not interested in people serving sentences anymore"" as “the crime rate is beginning to go up.” The U.S. crime rate is at a historic low, according to a recent study by the Brennan Center for Justice, and remained steady from 2014 to 2015.Then there’s the issue of whether the bill will contain a provision on ""mens rea,"" or having a ""guilty mind."" The provision, if included, would require prosecutors to prove a defendant’s guilt by establishing that he or she consciously intended to commit the offense.Under federal regulations and statues, this isn't required for certain offenses, such as crimes committed by corporate executives against public health or welfare. Republicans in the House badly want the ""mens rea"" requirement to apply to these crimes, but Democrats don’t -- making it evident that there are still deep divisions to overcome despite Thursday's bipartisan announcement.“It’s pretty clear to me that it’s going to be in the House bill, so at some point we are going to need to deal with it,” Cornyn said of the contested mens rea provision. “We’ve seen the over-criminalization of our regulatory system.” “One of the reasons it’s not in this bill is because senators like myself take exactly the opposing view,” said Whitehouse. “If we want to get into re-litigating elements of federal criminal code, then we can have that discussion separately.”“Like I said, no consensus,” Cornyn said. Overall, the bill’s proponents are optimistic, pointing to recent endorsements by key groups like the National District Attorneys Association -- the largest group of prosecutors in the country.The presidential race doesn't hurt either, according to Inimai Chettiar, director of the justice program for the Brennan Center for Justice. The need for criminal justice reform has become an important topic on the campaign trail, Chettiar said, and it's ""putting more pressure on the federal government to do something.""Groups like U.S. Justice Action Network intend to keep applying that pressure, especially on senators who are up for re-election in hotly contested races this year, said Holly Harris, executive director of the advocacy organization. Cornyn wouldn't say whether growing support for the bill means a vote could come up soon after the Senate recess next week. But if floor time opens up due to a stall in appropriations bills, he and other lawmakers are going to be ready to get the sentencing bill in there. ""We’ve got some momentum,” Cornyn said."

A new survey ranks the nation's most and least popular senators. And some Democrats are growing less fond of Obamacare. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, April 28, 2016. TED CRUZ PICKS A RELATIVELY UNPOPULAR RUNNING MATE - HuffPollster: ""Among the many confusing things about Republican hopeful Ted Cruz’s decision to announce Carly Fiorina as his running mate on Wednesday is this: She’s simply not that popular. There’s not much recent polling on Fiorina, who bowed out of the GOP race in February. But with the exception of a brief spike in popularity last fall, she made little impact on voters, peaking at less than 8 percent nationally before falling to just above the 2 percent mark. A late January YouGov/Economist survey found that 53 percent of Republicans viewed Fiorina favorably and 34 percent viewed her unfavorably, for a net rating of +19. That’s decent, but lower than GOP voters’ opinions of Cruz and fellow candidates Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump…. As of February, her average rating among all Americans was a net -18, making her nearly, though not quite, as disliked as Cruz himself, who stands at -23."" [HuffPost] CRUZ IS PROBABLY TOO CONSERVATIVE TO STOP TRUMP - Harry Enten: ""The moderate/liberal wing of the Republican Party simply hasn’t taken to Cruz’s campaign….In the 25 states that have voted so far and have exit or entrance poll data, Cruz has won an average of just 13 percent of voters who identify as either moderate or liberal. That is terrible. Leave Donald Trump aside for a second; Cruz’s other main rivals, first Marco Rubio and then John Kasich, have done much better with those groups. Cruz has run 26 percentage points behind Rubio/Kasich’s share of the moderate/liberal vote in an average of these 25 states. Even in his home state of Texas, Cruz trailed in this bloc by 5 percentage points. Only in Wisconsin was Cruz able to get a higher percentage of the moderate/liberal vote. Cruz likely needs to repeat his Wisconsin performance in future states, most notably Indiana next week, to have a shot at denying Trump the nomination."" [538] TRUMP'S CHANCES RISE IN PREDICTION MARKETS - David Rothschild: ""Trump surged [Tuesday] night from 75 percent likelihood to win the nomination to 83 percent this [Wednesday] morning. Most of this increase came at the expensive of Ted Cruz, because he is the only one left to give! More technically, Trump is now at 66 percent likely to reach the magic number of 1,237 pledged delegates. But, he is 79 percent likely to win the on the first ballot. The markets have been clear about this for months now; Trump does not need 1,237 pledged delegates to win. He needs closer to 1,200 pledged delegates, depending on how the unbound delegates are counted...Beyond Pennsylvania there are going to be over 100 completely unbound delegates, some of whom will vote for Trump in the first ballot. At this point, should he somehow lose the first ballot, he will be highly unlikely to win the nomination on a subsequent ballot."" [HuffPost] SANDERS IS THE MOST POPULAR SENATOR; MCCONNELL IS LEAST - Morning Consult: “Sen. Bernie Sanders may have watched his final hopes of being the Democratic presidential nominee flame out Tuesday night, but when he eventually heads home he can return knowing the people of Vermont still love him….Sanders remains the most popular senator in America...with an 80 percent approval rating. Other presidential contenders saw mixed results from the campaign trail. Florida Republican Marco Rubio’s approval rating dropped 5 points from November, down to 45 percent. His disapproval ratings increased 8 points to 41 percent. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is still competing for the Republican nomination, saw his approval rating increase 3 points to 55 percent with Texans, while his disapproval numbers went down two points to 30 percent. The least popular senator also hasn’t changed since we last released these results: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has the highest disapproval rating in the Senate, with 49 percent of Kentuckians saying they don’t have a favorable impression of him.” [Morning Consult]SOME DEMOCRATS ARE COOLING ON OBAMACARE - Kaiser Family Foundation: “Overall ratings of the [Affordable Care Act] lean negative this month, with 38 percent saying they have a favorable view and 49 percent saying they have an unfavorable view. The percentage of Democrats who have an unfavorable opinion of the law increased 6 percentage points to 25 percent, up from 19 percent last month. Of the Democrats who did not express a favorable opinion of the ACA, 40 percent want to expand what the law does, 20 percent do not know what they would like to see Congress do when it comes to the health care or mention something else, 19 percent want to repeal the entire law, 13 percent want to move forward with implementing the law as it is, and 9 percent want to scale back what the law does.” [Kaiser] But another survey finds Democrats warming toward the law's legacy - Pew Research: “The public’s views of the Affordable Care Act, which were evenly divided following the Supreme Court’s ruling last summer upholding a key section of the law, are again more negative than positive….However, the balance of opinion about the law’s impact on the country has grown less negative over the past three years, even as slightly more continue to see the impact as negative than positive. Currently, 44% say the law’s impact on the country has been mostly negative, 39% say it has been mostly positive and 13% say it has not had much of an effect….Most of the rise in positive views of the law’s effect on the country has come among Democrats and independents. The share of Democrats who view the law’s impact on the nation positively has risen 24 percentage points (from 42% in December 2013 to 66% today), while the share of independents who say it has had a positive impact has risen from 17% in December 2013 to 36% today.” [Pew]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!
