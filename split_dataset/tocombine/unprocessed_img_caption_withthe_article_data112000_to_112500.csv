1,SPORTS,10 NFL Players Closing In On Big New Contracts,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nfl-players-new-contracts_n_5705053.html,,2014-08-24,"HOUSTON, TX- DECEMBER 01: J.J. Watt #99 of the Houston Texans is introduced before playing against the New England Patriots on December 1, 2013 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. (Photo by Thomas B. Shea/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76b572600003500834c01.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ari Nissim, National Football Post With just under two weeks until the commencement of the 2014 NFL regular season, some integral contract negotiations have been completed, while some additional deals will likely get done before the conclusion of the preseason. With that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the notable players who are of interest to people and break down what we should be watching for. Some players from the 2011 draft class such as Atlanta’s Julio Jones (injury), Denver’s Von Miller (suspensions) and San Francisco’s Aldon Smith (off the field) will more than likely have to wait to get new deals until after this season. However, there are still plenty of interesting deals that could see pen hit paper in the very near future.1. Dez Bryant, WR, Dallas Cowboys: I’m hearing this deal is not close. In addition, Eugene Parker (Bryant’s agent) has been known to take his time to exert maximum leverage, so I don’t expect this deal to get done until later or after the season.Prediction: Late season or after season2. A.J. Green, WR, Cincinnati Bengals: One of the top wide receivers in the league with prototype size who has produced over 1,000 receiving yards receiving every year in the league. Green is going to be looking to be paid at the top of the wide receiver market (currently approximately $16 million per year) in both average per year and guaranteed money. The Bengals do not guarantee money outside of a signing bonus, so this is going to create a potential pitfall that will only be able to be worked around with a huge signing bonus (think $20 million+), followed up with a roster bonus in the second year for approximately another $10 million. The fact that Green will be looking to get maximum money will create issues in this deal getting done. I do not expect this deal to be concluded any earlier than next offseason. Green potentially could play out his contract and get tagged by the Bengals after next year.Prediction: A long way off3. Justin Houston, OLB, Kansas City Chiefs: The two-time Pro-Bowler alleviated pre-draft concerns and has put together some solid numbers as a pass rusher, with double-digit sack totals in each of the last two years while averaging 1.0 sack per start in 2013. The pass rushing market is a bit volatile at the moment, with deals ranging from $8 million all the way up to $16 million for Mario Williams. At 25 years of age, I would assume this contract would be right around the deal fellow Kansas City pass rusher Tamba Hali signed for.Prediction: During the season4. Gerald McCoy, DT, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: McCoy is everything the Bucs hoped for when he was selected third overall back in 2010. The roadblock to this deal is the fact that McCoy is scheduled to make $12.7 million this year, a number higher than the $12.1 million average for the highest paid DT in the league (Haloti Ngata, 2011). But this deal is going to get done as I believe both sides will meet in the middle on a price in the $12-$13 million range, making McCoy the highest paid defensive tackle in the league for a short period until Detroit’s Ndamukong Suh signs a new deal with the Lions or elsewhere.Prediction: Anytime from now until the end of the season5. Robert Quinn, DE, St. Louis Rams: I think both sides here reach an agreement in due time. However, some intangibles may keep this deal from getting done sooner rather than later, I expect an average in the $14 million range.Prediction: Before the end of the season6. Alex Smith, QB, Kansas City Chiefs: So the Chiefs traded for Alex Smith and went to the playoffs in his first year with the club. However, Smith doesn’t really inspire teams to say, “This is our franchise quarterback.” He enjoyed his best statistical season in 2013 with career highs in almost every category, but Smith is a game manager and most teams are looking for more than that. On the positive side, he’s only 30-years-old, is accurate and doesn’t turn the ball over. So there are plenty of teams that would be happy to make them their starter. If this deal gets done, it should be pretty close to what Andy Dalton got in Cincinnati, which is not going to make agent Tom Condon fond of signing off. A bridge could come in the form of adding more guaranteed money to the deal to get it done with a lower average per year. Without that, Alex will likely have to step it up or step in to get the deal done.Prediction: Do I look like a genie?7. Ndamkong Suh, DT, Detroit Lions: Looking to become the highest paid defensive player at $16+ million is difficult enough. Looking to do it on a team that already pays two players over $16 million per year is pretty unlikely even if Detroit does believe that Suh is the best defensive lineman in the league. In addition, Suh has maximum leverage as he enters the final year of a contract created under the old rookie system. Suh has already pocketed over $50 million and has a cap number of over $22 million in 2014, making it highly unlikely and, more pointedly, dumb to franchise him next year.Prediction: Not done until the 2014 Combine at the earliest8. Demarius Thomas, WR, Denver Broncos: This deal makes way too much sense not to get done. However, Mike Sullivan (Broncos Director of Football Administration) hasn’t shown a great track record of getting contracts signed early since he joined the Broncos. Offensive tackle Ryan Clady signed the last day a franchise player could sign a long-term deal and pass rusher Elvis Dummervil is now a Raven after he got cut because signatures were not all in before the Broncos’ imposed deadline.Prediction: Unknown9. J.J. Watt, DE, Houston Texans: I don’t see this deal getting done until after the season. With the money that Watt is asking for, there really isn’t a reason to wrap this up early.Prediction: Next offseason10. Muhammad Wilkerson, DE, New York Jets: He is the best player on a very good defensive front for the Jets and can play end in either a 3-4 or 4-3 defense, as well as move inside to play defensive tackle if needed. Wilkerson is one of the more underrated players in the league. However, general manager John Idzik is not in a hurry to do a deal with anyone, as reported earlier this year during free agency, so this deal will not likely get done until next offseason at the earliest. Unless, of course, Wilkerson takes a below market deal for peace of mind.Prediction: Next year or laterFollow Ari on Twitter: @arinissimAri Nissim worked with the New York Jets from 2006 through 2013, six as Director of Football Administration; In addition he interned at the NFL League office and worked at Athletic Resource Management Sports Agency, and currently teaches in the NYU Sports Management Program.

Rand Paul says that if the former secretary of state seeks the presidency, some voters will worry that she will get the U.S. involved in another Mideast war.Paul is a leading anti-interventionist in the GOP and is considering running for president. Last year he opposed President Barack Obama's call for military action in Syria.In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Paul predicted a ""transformational election"" if the Democrats nominate ""a war hawk like Hillary Clinton.""""I think that's what scares the Democrats the most, is that in a general election, were I to run, there's gonna be a lot of independents and even some Democrats who say, 'You know what? We are tired of war,'"" Paul said. ""We're worried that Hillary Clinton will get us involved in another Middle Eastern war, because she's so gung-ho.""As a senator in 2002, Clinton voted in favor of giving President George W. Bush the broad authority to invade Iraq. She has said over the years that she regrets that vote, and in her new book ""Hard Choices"" wrote that ""I wasn't alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.""On the events that unfolded in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Paul said he found the war-like images disturbing.""When I see things like that, and I see, like, a warzone, and I see bazookas and tanks and all of this stuff in American city, it offends me, because many of these people, some are rioting, and they need to be arrested,"" he said. ""If you're committing a crime, arrest people. But if you're standing up, and you wanna voice dissent, you know, it is really what America is about, is being able to dissent.""Paul also suggested that race might not be a factor in the events in Ferguson and linked the unrest to the war on drugs.""Let's say you're African-American and you live there, let's say none of this has to do with race. It might not, but the belief — if you're African-American and you live in Ferguson, the belief is, you see people in prison and they're mostly black and brown, that somehow it is racial, even if the thoughts that were going on at that time had nothing to do with race.""So it's a very good chance that had this had nothing to do with race, but because of all of the arrest and the way people were arrested, that everybody perceives it as, 'My goodness, the police are out to get us,' you know? And so that's why you have to change the whole war on drugs. It's not just this one instance.""Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In a liberal city notorious for being ""unchurched,"" Mars Hill has grown to about 6,000 people in just over a decade. (AP Photo/Scott Cohen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7edf525000036003a0a7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Controversial Seattle megachurch founder Mark Driscoll will step down for at least six weeks while church leaders review formal charges lodged by a group of pastors that he abused his power.The 43-year-old pastor has been under fire in recent months for plagiarism, inappropriate use of church funds and improper behavior toward subordinates.Returning from vacation Sunday (Aug. 24), Driscoll addressed Mars Hill worship services through a pre-recorded message.“I want to say to my Mars Hill family, past and present, I’m very sorry. I genuinely mean it,” Driscoll said in his address. “I’m very sorry for the times I’ve been angry, short or insensitive. I’m very sorry for anything I’ve done to distract from our mission by inviting criticism, controversy or negative media attention.”Driscoll said he will not do any outside speaking for the foreseeable future and postpone the publication of his next book.“I have begun meeting with a professional team of mature Christians who provide wise counsel to help further my personal development and maturity before God and men,” Driscoll told the congregation.Mark DeMoss, an Atlanta public relations consultant and former adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, has been brought in to work with the congregation.DeMoss, who represented the late Jerry Falwell Sr. and now Franklin Graham, said he attended the services in Seattle today on his own expense as Driscoll’s friend.“I think he’s a gifted, biblical communicator who has done effective church work in an unchurched part of the country,” DeMoss said. “I like him, I believe in him, and if I only worked with ministry leaders who were faultless, I would be out of business tonight.”Warren Throckmorton, a Grove City College psychology professor who has been blogging details of the events surrounding the church’s turmoil, first posted an audio clip of Driscoll’s 13-minute message. Throckmorton said other elders may resign or are considering it.“Storm clouds seem to be swirling around me more than ever in recent month, and I have given much thought and sought much counsel as to why that is and what to do about it,” Driscoll said. “Some have challenged various aspects of my personality and leadership style, and while some of these challenges seem unfair, I have no problem admitting I am deserving of some of these criticisms based my own past actions that I am genuinely sorry for.”Though he has long been controversial but popular for his unapologetic chauvinism, Driscoll faced increasing turmoil this past year within evangelical circles. A front-page story in The New York Times Saturday (Aug. 23), suggested Driscoll’s empire was “imploding.”“He was really important — in the Internet age, Mark Driscoll definitely built up the evangelical movement enormously,” Timothy Keller, the senior pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York, told the Times. “But the brashness and the arrogance and the rudeness in personal relationships — which he himself has confessed repeatedly — was obvious to many from the earliest days, and he has definitely now disillusioned quite a lot of people.”Mars Hill Church has claimed as many as 14,000 members at 15 locations across five states each Sunday.Earlier this week, 21 former Mars Hill pastors filed charges against Driscoll, saying that he has engaged in a pattern of abusive and intimidating conduct and has not changed.“God is not honored by conflict, strife, disunity, arguing, slander, gossip, or anything else that is inconsistent with the fruit of the spirit, and I am deeply sorry, genuinely sorry, for the times I have not lived peaceably with all men,” Driscoll said.Mars Hill also canceled its fall Resurgence Conference, which was to feature recently resigned board members Paul Tripp and James MacDonald as speakers. Driscoll was removed as closing speaker at an October church conference in Dallas and stricken from the speaker list at a series of four Christian “Act Like Men” conferences.DeMoss, who also helped MacDonald during a theological controversy a few years ago, declined to comment on the criticism Driscoll has faced from other fellow evangelical pastors.Earlier this month, Driscoll was removed from Acts 29, a church-planting network of more than 500 churches he helped found, after board members said they found a pattern of “ungodly and disqualifying behavior.”“Based on the totality of the circumstances, we are now asking you to please step down from ministry for an extended time and seek help,” board members told Driscoll.Driscoll recently admitted to and apologized for comments he made under the pseudonym “William Wallace II” where he posted statements critical of feminism, homosexuality and “sensitive emasculated” men. He noted those comments again in his address on Sunday.“I have acknowledged and confessed many of my sins and shortcomings and missteps and God has been more than faithful with his forgiveness,” he said.He has been provocative, occasionally profane, and has faced more recent allegations of plagiarism and inflating his book sales. “Mistakes were made that I am grieved by and apologize for,” he said late last year of plagiarism charges. He also apologized in March, saying “my angry-young-prophet days are over.”After Acts 29 removed Driscoll from its membership, LifeWay Christian Resources, the nation’s second largest Christian book retailer, pulled Driscoll’s books from its website and 186 stores.Driscoll, who came into evangelical prominence as multi-site churches and podcasts were becoming more popular, noted one of the paradoxes of being a pastor in a media age.“The same media channels that can be used to carry a sermon to virtually anyone around the world, can be used by anyone around the globe to criticize, attack or slander,” Driscoll said. “However, another part of it is simply my fault and I will own it, confess it and move on from it as God continues to redeem me.”DeMoss echoed Driscoll’s comments.“I think this is a challenging day for all pastors, in large part because of this media age we live in,” DeMoss said. “It’s very easy to mobilize opposition, and anybody can have a public forum to criticize or expose or say whatever they want to say. That wasn’t true even 10 years ago.”"

I am escorted to a hospital room occupied by one or more patients. I need to size up the situation quickly and select the one song that might go over best.,2014-08-24,2014-08-13-Smokey_Robinson_and_The_Miracles_1972.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-13-Smokey_Robinson_and_The_Miracles_1972-thumb.JPG,"Solo gigs allow me the freedom to perform any song I feel like singing. The decision about what to play in a given situation is mostly spontaneous. I have a binder with song lyrics and chord changes, but it doesn't serve as a set list. I just go with what seems right at that moment. Sometimes I make a great selection and other times I totally miss the mark. It comes with the territory. My volunteer gigs with Musicians On Call present a unique challenge in song selection. I am escorted to a hospital room occupied by one or more patients (sometimes with visitors or family members). I need to size up the situation quickly and select the one song that might go over best. My repertoire largely consists of what I call ""songs you can sing wearing a cowboy hat."" Older patients might hear ""Back In The Saddle Again"" or ""Don't Fence Me In."" Younger folks appreciate songs by Elvis, Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly or Johnny Cash.The other day, I was doing a gig at a large nursing and rehab facility in central Queens. I had been there several times and have come to know many of the patients. I felt the need to bring out different material, so I was trying a few of the songs in the back of the binder: Motown, Sam Cooke and other songs that I simply enjoy singing. I had just done a decent job with ""My Cherie Amour"" and felt confident that I had my high notes that day.My escort Willie is usually waiting for me when I'm done singing, but this time he was not there. I looked up and down the hallway and didn't spot him. I did not feel that I should look into other rooms, so I just waited and pondered what song to try next.He came out of a nearby room a few minutes later and looked downcast and forlorn. Apparently the patient in that room had just received some terrible news about her condition, delivered by a doctor lacking in compassion. Willie is a gentle and caring man and he had taken the time to help this poor woman come to terms with what she had just been told.So now it was up to me to sing the right song for this person. A decision that normally has no great consequence was now fraught with strong emotions. What do you sing to someone in this situation?I thought about the Musicians on Call guidelines: avoid songs about death, dying, heaven, etc. That eliminates a whole lot of cowboy songs right there. Somehow I couldn't bring myself to sing a chipper, upbeat song to this woman at this moment. It would be emotionally dishonest and even disrespectful of her feelings.Then I glanced down at my binder and saw ""The Tracks of My Tears."" My mind was racing: When was the last time I sang this song? I don't remember doing a very good job with it. And it's impossible to sing like Smokey when you're getting choked up yourself. What are the changes? Oh yeah, the song starts with a simple progression in G. Well, here goes nothing. I hit the high notes all right, but I'm sure it wasn't the best rendition of the song. However, it didn't really matter. The woman sang along, quietly at first; more confidently by the end. Her spirits appeared to be lifted, perhaps just a little. I saw a genuine smile of gratitude as she thanked me.At the end of the gig, Willie was effusive in his complements. ""I hope you know you made a lot of people happy today."" I am always grateful for his kind words, but I felt that there was a lot more going on that day than simply brightening someone's day with a song or two.I thought about how music has the power to express the inexpressible and how a song like ""The Tracks of My Tears"" carries a deeper meaning beyond the literal story of the song. What did the song mean to that woman? ""Outside, I masquerading/inside, my hope is fading."" Was the smile I saw really out of place? I will likely never know.[The song has new resonance for me with the recent death of Robin Williams. How sad that someone who brought us so much joy could not find it himself.]I didn't write ""The Tracks of My Tears"" and goodness knows others have sung it better. As a musician, my job was simply to connect that song to that person at that moment. I will take credit for the choice and a passable singing job; everything else is between Smokey and her.Any performance, whether it's in a stadium or a hospital room, has the potential to generate strong feelings in an audience. I generally traffic in nostalgia; other musicians deal with excitement, love, rage, wonder and the full range of human emotions. This ability to reach people deep inside is a wonderful, powerful tool and we must always treat it with the respect it demands. It is what makes a music career worth all the sacrifice and hard work."

Instead of being able to reflect on the distance we have traveled since 1964, the horrific events unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri only served to remind us of how far we still have to go.  It's not just the thought of Michael Brown lying dead in the street with six bullets in his young body. It's not just the scene of police in armored vehicles, dressed in battle fatigues, military issue helmets, and gas masks staring down demonstrators through the gun-sights of their high-powered weapons. It is that. But it is so much more.  It's the pent up frustration of Ferguson's African-American community. Despite comprising more than two-thirds of their city's population, they must deal with hostility from a police presence that is 95 percent white. They face daily reminders of their subordinate status in the form of harassment and incidents of racial profiling. Add to this, the rage of too many African-Americans in Ferguson and the nation who are disproportionately plagued by youth unemployment and inadequate public education opportunities trapping them in the crippling clutches of poverty and violence and despair and anger.  What played out on the streets of Ferguson -- the stand-off between demonstrators chanting ""black life matters"" and ""hands up/don't shoot"" facing well-armed police -- is America's tragic unfinished business in a microcosm. It's not just Ferguson, its all of us who are on one side or the other of that line that has divided our nation since its beginning.  Everywhere we look in today's America we see signs telling us that in the 150 years since the end of slavery and the 50 years since the Civil Rights Bill we still haven't gotten it right.  We want to ignore it, but we cannot and should not forget the simple truth that our nation was born in sin -- slavery was its name. Freedom didn't come with the stroke of Lincoln's pen. Releasing slaves without providing the means to right the wrong and alleviate the injustice of that evil institution left generations of African-Americans to be preyed upon in the post-Reconstruction South. Moving north to find work they found segregation which locked them into ghettos of poverty where they were again preyed upon and exploited.   Slavery had ended, but racism lived on. Because we have not confronted its corrosive evil and lasting stain, it continues to infect our political, social, and cultural life. Raw economic data and public opinion polls show how deep the gap between the races. One of the most disturbing statistics that should haunt us all is the fact that one-third of young African American males are either in prison, serving terms or awaiting trial, or on parole. Something is terribly wrong. That we apparently can't accept our collective paternity for this situation and that our leaders lack the will or just outright refuse to address this tragic situation that denies our young men the opportunity to succeed - only ensures that it will continue for another generation. Unless we own this sin and face it down, the gap will persist, leading to more Fergusons.  Some naively believed that the election of Barack Obama would move us beyond race. Instead, his election only served to aggravate the latent racism that has long defined our politics. Two generations ago, it was ""states' rights"", segregation, and Jim Crow. One generation ago, it was expressed in coded messages like ""welfare queens"", or ""Willie Horton"". Today the focus is on the President, himself. Listening to the Tea Party or the Birther Movement or the Faith and Freedom crowd, we hear subtle, and not so subtle racism -- ""he's not like us"", ""he's not for us"", ""he's not born here"", ""he's a Muslim"" ""he scares me, I worry about what kind of America my children will live in"", or ""we want our country back.""  It is as if middle-aged, middle class, white Americans, facing the most severe economic crisis since the Depression, woke up one morning to find a young educated black man in the White House and could not contain their confusion and rage at what they believed was their displacement.   The persistent physical division of our country into largely segregated neighborhoods -- with those who have, or at least, feel that they are entitled to have, facing off against and fearing those who have not -- has produced the drama of Ferguson with its defining emotions of resentment and fear and anger and its over-militarized police force guarding the gates of privilege and ""public order"".  Take a step back and think for a moment how the scenes of Ferguson look to the rest of the world and the shame of it all sinks in. We like to think of ourselves as setting a standard for the world and we are all too often inclined to criticize the failings of others -- while in reality, the bar we've set for ourselves is so awfully low. To borrow from Jesus in the Gospel, we are so good at seeing the splinter in our neighbor's eye, while missing the log in our own.  We can and must do better. In the 1990s, then President Clinton invited us to engage in a national dialogue on race. I had hoped, back then, that a real national conversation would take place in our schools, places of worship, community centers, and living rooms. That we would listen to each other and come to know each other's fears and resentments, hopes and dreams. And that out of that sustained encounter we would be better able to become the ""One America"" Clinton had envisioned. The project never really got off the ground. But that should not discourage us from trying it again. Healing the racial divide should be our nation's priority.  Only if we make a determined effort, as a society, to move beyond division and inequality will we be able to bring to life Dr. King's dream and ensure that there are no more Ferguson's and no more Michael Brown's anywhere.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

Spain's coastguard today rescued more than 260 sub-Saharan African migrants crossing the Strait of Gibraltar on small boats. Many migrants from sub-Saharan Africa attempt to cross into Spain from Morocco, either by sea through the Strait of Gibraltar or overland, via the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in the extreme north of Morocco.

Many head for Italy, and so far in 2014, the total number reaching Italian shores has passed 100,000, the Italian government said this week.Libya is a major departure point for this journey, and human traffickers are exploiting the political chaos and lack of security that has blighted the country since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising in 2011.The small boat crammed with between 150-200 migrants sank late on Friday near Qarabouli, east of Tripoli, local coast guard official Mohammad Abdellatif told Reuters Television.Local fishermen raised the alarm at dawn on Saturday morning and the coast guard managed to rescue 16 migrants who were still alive in the water, surrounded by bodies, Abdellatif said.The boat had entirely disappeared when the coast guard arrived at the scene, around 1 km from the beach, he said. STATE TURMOILThe coast guard in Qarabouli has no equipment and so is forced to borrow fishing vessels and tug boats to carry out their rescue missions, he added.All of those rescued were released as there was nowhere to detain them, Abdellatif said. He said he had informed the local hospital, the ministry of health and the criminal investigations department of the accident but that all three had refused to collect the bodies.In recent weeks, Libya has seen the worst violence since the 2011 rebellion as rival factions battle each other for influence and control of the country's wealth. Foreign embassies and agencies have evacuated their staff and the entire parliament has decamped to the country's east.State authority has crumbled and basic services are becoming increasingly more difficult to come by.""The coast guard has no problem with searching for the missing illegal migrants, but the problem is who will receive them after finding them,"" Libya's navy spokesman Ayoub Qassem said,""They have no locations to accept them and the immigration authorities are not helpful enough to receive them on time,"" he said.The Italian navy told Reuters they were not involved in the incident and had no further details.Italy is carrying out the bulk of patrols in the Mediterranean Sea aimed at preventing major tragedies involving migrants. More than 70,000 people have been rescued through the ""Mare Nostrum"" (Our Sea) mission of patrols which Italy began last October.

The Chicago Cubs' now-famous tarp fail during a rain delay earlier this week is being blamed on the team's cost-cutting reaction to Obamacare by unnamed sources who spoke with The Chicago Sun-Times. During Tuesday's home game against the San Francisco Giants, heavy rains sent the Cubs' ground crew scrambling as they fought a sad (or hilarious?) losing battle against a rain-soaked tarp. The 20-minute downpour and not-quite-covered infield led to a four hour and 34 minute delay.As many as 10 crew members were reportedly sent home early on Tuesday night with ""little, if any"" input from the field-level supervisors. The move was purportedly part of a massive reorganization that the Cubs enacted last winter designed to keep as many workers as possible under the hourly limit that would qualify them for employer-healthcare provided under the Affordable Care Act. And like the wealthy uncle who annually gives $5 checks for family birthdays, the Cubs --  Major League Baseball's fourth most-valuable team -- are ""cheap,"" according to unnamed high-ranking official from another team who spoke with the Sun-Times.The Cubs, whose owners are noted Obama and ACA opponents, subsequently told ESPN Chicago that the tarp mishap was a ""freak thing"" and not connected to ACA policies. Not only was the tarp fail a national embarrassment for the team, it also cleared the way for the Giants to lodge the first successful protest of a game's results since 1986. "

Brown, a former U.S. Senator in Massachusetts, recently moved to New Hampshire, and will look to take on incumbent U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d37825000094003a538b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Two surveys released this week shattered perceptions of key Senate battleground races in New Hampshire and Georgia, but dig a little deeper and you'll find ample reason to be skeptical about any game-changing declarations less than three months from Election Day. A new UNH/WMUR poll released Thursday showed Scott Brown (R) in a statistical tie with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) -- a 10-point gain for the former Massachusetts senator since UNH last polled the race in July. The same poll found that Shaheen's favorability rating dropped by a net 16 points, which the pollster attributed to President Barack Obama's unpopularity across the country.""Sound the alarms!"" the National Republican Senatorial Committee wrote in an email. ""The poll has enormous ramifications."" Jonathan Weisman of The New York Times tweeted, ""If this poll is right, the bottom may be dropping out for Senate Democrats."" Politico's Mike Allen chimed in by noting that the new numbers will ""help bring other big donors off the sidelines because they are saying, 'Wow, a Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might be a real thing.' If Scott Brown wins, they are very far on the way to that.""But add some context, and the poll's significance narrows considerably. Shaheen had consistently edged Brown all year in the Democrat-leaning state, often by double digits. HuffPost Pollster, which averages publicly available polling data, shows Shaheen topping Brown by 6 points -- including the new UNH poll. So why the movement now? The Washington Post notes that more identified Republicans responded to this poll than previous polls. Moreover, the base is beginning to coalesce around Brown, and the race is likely to tighten further as Election Day approaches.As Tom Jensen, the director of Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling, told The Huffington Post on Friday, the race was never truly a 12-point blowout for Shaheen, as some polls had registered early in the race. Nor is it likely a dead heat, as the UNH poll showed. Rather, it's more likely somewhere in between.Over in the Georgia Senate race, which has consistently leaned Republican, another poll released Friday raised eyebrows among political operatives. According to a Landmark Communications survey conducted for WSB-TV, Democrat Michelle Nunn tops Republican David Perdue by a 7-point margin. Right on cue, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee blasted out the poll to reporters, in hopes of drawing attention to the game-changing results.But the new data stands in stark contrast to other polling in the race, which has consistently found the Republican businessman to be topping Nunn. According to HuffPost Pollster, Perdue currently maintains a 5-point lead. Curiously, Landmark Communications has shown Nunn with a substantial lead over Perdue all three times it has polled the race. In July, one poll found Nunn with a 7-point advantage, while another had her up a whopping 10 points. The survey's results also left WSB-TV political analyst Bill Crane scratching his head. “David Perdue being behind Michelle Nunn is surprising,"" he said.Both the Georgia and New Hampshire Senate races are likely to narrow as voters begin to tune in ahead of November's midterm elections. But recent polling is best taken with a grain of salt, lest we forget the lessons of the 2012 presidential campaign."
