(AP Photo/Alik Keplicz)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14dad2300003300d0c93c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WARSAW, May 24 (Reuters) - Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski conceded defeat to conservative challenger Andrzej Duda in Sunday's presidential election, a result that will set alarm bells ringing for the government, which faces its own election race later this year.Komorowski had originally been seen as a shoo-in for another term in office, and his defeat reflected a desire among voters for new faces, and a sense that Poland's new-found prosperity was not being shared out equally.The outgoing president, an ally of Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, announced he was conceding defeat after an exit poll showed he had won 47 percent to 53 percent for Duda. Official results have not yet been released.""I respect your choice,"" Komorowski told a gathering of supporters. ""I wish my challenger a successful presidency.""The victory for 43-year-old Duda marks the first major electoral win in almost a decade for his party, the opposition Law and Justice party. It is close to the Catholic church, socially conservative, and markets see it as less business friendly than the governing Civic Platform.Poland's zloty currency was down one percent against the euro after the exit poll was released, a sign some investors are already expecting a change in government.In Poland, the prime minister leads the government but the president is head of the armed forces, has a say in foreign policy and in the passage of legislation, and also controls who heads the central bank.Duda served as legal adviser to former conservative President Lech Kaczynski, was a deputy justice minister, a member of the Polish parliament, and is now a member of the European parliament.He has yet to spell out explicitly how he will use his new powers, but he could promote a more skeptical approach to the European Union, and block socially-liberal initiatives such as a proposed law that would support in-vitro fertilization.""I deeply believe that we can reconstruct our community. I am convinced that we can be together, that we can improve our country,"" he said in a victory speech.DIFFICULT QUESTIONSHis win throws down a gauntlet to the governing center-right Civic Platform party.Eight years in power, the party has presided over rapid economic growth and rising salaries in eastern Europe's biggest economy.But despite unprecedented prosperity, many Poles feel the fruits of their labor have been unfairly spread, resulting in increased inequality, and are eager for new faces at the top.""Economic growth? For the average citizen it is hardly perceptible,"" said Zbigniew Pela, 53, a railway worker who was voting for Duda on Sunday. ""They create good living conditions for some social groups, who have their businesses, and not for ordinary citizens.""Foreign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna said Sunday's result was a serious warning for Civic Platform. ""We have to ask ourselves difficult questions ahead of the next elections,"" he told public broadcaster TVP Info.

Stripped of everything, the 48 survivors scavenge what they can from the plane for their survival. The band of friends, family, enemies and strangers must work together against the cruel weather and harsh terrain if they want to stay alive. But the island holds many secrets, including the intense howls of the mysterious creatures stalking the jungle, which fill them all with fear.

""I think that I’d probably send Hurley,"" Lindelof told us. The fan favorite character would help Tomorrowland with his positive thinking, something largely essential to the movie's plot, Lindelof explained. ""It’s always just nice to have someone around to lighten things up. He’s got a great sense of humor,"" Lindelof said. Hurley ""tended to always be the glass half full guy."" We couldn't agree more, and we bet Hurley would take full advantage of the jetpacks there.While working on ""Tomorrowland,"" Lindelof also spent his time on the upcoming season of HBO's ""The Leftovers."" The series, co-created by Lindelof and inspired by Tom Perrotta's novel of the same name, follows those who remain after the mysterious, sudden disappearance of two percent of the world's population. It is one of the bleakest, most depressing shows on television, a stark contrast to the optimistic ""Tomorrowland.""Lindelof said the HBO show ""was constantly threatening to infect"" his latest Disney adventure. ""The gravitational pull of that feeling, [that] darkness and depression, is so much more powerful than the optimistic and bright pull of 'Tomorrowland,'"" he said. ""When you spend time in a creative world like that, it does affect your mood. I was probably not the most pleasant person to live with,"" he added.When ""The Leftovers"" returns for its second season, at least we'll have ""Tomorrowland"" to yank us out of our depression. Or we can just think more like Hurley.""Tomorrowland"" is now playing in theaters."

A Los Angeles judge ruled Friday, May 22, 2015, that Loeb can file an amended lawsuit seeking custody of embryos he created with Vergara before their relationship ended lastÂ year. Loeb wants the embryos to be implanted in a surrogate but Vergara's attorney says Loeb doesn't have a viable legal claim. (Photo by John Shearer/Invision/AP, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb604af240000320056982d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nick Loeb, ex-fiancé of “Modern Family” actress Sofia Vergara, was granted permission on Friday to file a revised lawsuit seeking custody of two frozen embryos the couple created when they were together.Loeb, 39, first sued Vergara in August 2014 -- four months after they split up -- seeking to void the contract that they both signed when they had the embryos created using Loeb's sperm and Vergara's eggs in 2013. The contract stated that “any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties’ consent.” Loeb’s suit argued that the contract should be voided because it did not specify what would happen if the pair broke up.In the newly amended lawsuit, Loeb will specifically be suing for custody of the embryos, Entertainment Tonight reported.Loeb’s attorneys have claimed that the first lawsuit was an attempt to ensure Vergara did not destroy the embryos. However, lawyers for the 42-year-old actress stated that she never wanted the embryos destroyed, but merely wished to leave them frozen indefinitely.The legal battle gained publicity in April, when Loeb wrote an op-ed about the situation for The New York Times, titled “Our Frozen Embryos Have a Right to Live.” In the piece, Loeb refers to a frozen embryo as an “unborn child” and writes that “keeping [the embryos] frozen forever is tantamount to killing them.”Vergara said the lawsuit “makes no sense” in an interview with Howard Stern earlier this month, People reported. She told Stern that a child ""needs a loving relationship of parents that get along, that don't hate each other” and it would be “selfish” to bring the embryos to term otherwise.She indicated that if the issue were “so serious” for Loeb, he should have taken the legal contract more seriously when he signed it.

While the human toll is always great, wars also cost treasure as well as blood.Many factors can affect the cost of waging war. Using a report from the Congressional Research Service, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the most expensive wars in U.S. history. While the Mexican-American War cost just $2.4 billion, or 1.4% of GDP in 1847, spending on World War II accounted for nearly 36% of GDP in 1945, or $4.1 trillion. These are the most expensive wars in U.S. history.Click here to see the most expensive wars in U.S. history.Many early wars in U.S. history resulted in the acquisition of land. The Mexican-American War in the 1840s yielded much of the territory that makes up the present-day Southwest. Similarly, the Spanish-American War prior to the start of the 20th Century ended with U.S. control of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.In every conflict before World War II, nearly all of the country’s defense budget was spent on direct conflict — classified as wartime spending. For example, the U.S. spent 1.1% of GDP in 1899 to fight the Spanish-American War, and just 1.5% of GDP was spent on total defense spending.That trend largely changed at the start of the Cold War. The persistent threat of military conflict ensured that the U.S. would be ready for war at any time, as the Space Race and nuclear armament became national priorities in both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. As a result, wartime spending and defense spending began to diverge. During the Korean War, for example, war costs accounted for just 4.2% of GDP in 1952, while total defense spending represented more than 13% of GDP in the same year.Comparing war costs over a 235-year period can be difficult. While the report attempted to correct for inflation by calculating each war’s cost in fiscal year 2011 dollars, inflation adjustments do not account for advances in technology. It is entirely possible that wars also became more expensive over time as the sophistication and cost of technology increased.To determine the most expensive wars in U.S. history, 24/7 Wall St. used a 2010 report from the Congressional Research Service entitled “Costs of Major U.S. Wars”. The report does not include veterans’ benefits, interest on loans used to finance the war, and assistance to allies. Additionally, the report attempts to capture the increase in military expenditures during wartime and does not include the costs of maintaining a standing army in peacetime. The report also presents both military costs and defense spending as percentages of GDP in the year of peak war spending. War cost figures for the War on Terror were updated to reflect expenditure after 2010.These are the most expensive wars in U.S. history."

Names/numbers on credit card removed/altered.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ecfc92000003100fe80ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to booking a hotel online, what you see isn't always what you get.Christina Daves knows. On several occasions, she's shopped for a hotel room online and then clicked through to make a reservation, only to discover she was actually dealing with a third-party site that looked like a hotel site.""Often,"" said Daves, who owns a medical device company in Washington, D.C., ""there are no refunds on a reservation made through one of these sites, if you want to cancel or make a change.""The hotel industry is worried, too. It recently asked the Department of Justice to investigate travel sites that are ""trying to pass themselves off as the actual hotel."" The industry, represented by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA), estimates that 2.5 million bookings are affected by this site-spoofing each year, which translates into more than $220 million going toward what it calls ""bad"" bookings.At best, these reservations are simply made on behalf of a third party instead of by the hotel and may have additional restrictions or booking fees. But at worst, they may be completely bogus bookings that won't be recognized by a property.Pinpointing the problem is easy, but a solution isn't. It turns out the fake sites operate outside the country and can be difficult to identify as fraudulent.Who are these companies? There are thousands of them, according to AH&LA, and they go by names like Reservationcounter.com, Reservationdesk.com and Hotelsone.com.""These sites are constantly changing their names, URLs and phone numbers to evade legal repercussions,"" said Maryam Cope, AH&LA's vice president of government affairs. ""If you go to one of these sites, the phone number will likely be one thing around 3 p.m. and something else by 6 p.m., then again something else by 10 p.m. It's a constant cat-and-mouse game to keep up with these rogue sites.""Hotelsone.com did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Daniel Nelson, the chief executive of TravelPASS Group, the Salt Lake City-based company that operates the sites Reservationcounter.com and Reservationdesk.com, said his company's sites have been around for many years and that reservations made through them are legitimate. He denies they are trying to imitate hotel Web sites, which is obvious when you compare the sites.""The AH&LA is trying to turn this into a 'buyer beware' story,"" he said. ""But the truth is, if they get their way -- if the only safe booking is a direct booking -- it will limit consumer choice and reduce your options.""Indeed, there's more happening here than meets the eye. It's a barely visible conflict between hotel operators and the online agencies, many of them legitimate, which help them sell their inventory. They seem to be waging a war of rhetoric, using anecdotes as ammunition. Consumers are caught in the crossfire.Merle Kappelmann, who owns the Flamingo Inn in Daytona Beach, Fla., said she was taken aback when seven guests walked into her hotel during the city's annual Bike Week and claimed to have reservations at $79 a night. They didn't. Rooms were going for between $179 and $200 per night that week, and she could find no record of the group. The reservation had been made by a mysterious company named Reservation Counter, she said.""We called and asked, 'How is it possible that they can have our information available for people to make reservations without us signing a contract or agreeing to rates?'"" she recalled. ""They were unable to give us answers and refused to tell us where they were located, who owns the business, and since they all had foreign accents, we thought they may have been out of South America.""To further complicate the issue, some sites that appear to be trying to capitalize on a hotel's name are actually legitimate. Greg Fisher, the president of a regional online travel agency called TripShock, says his hotel listings in the Florida Panhandle show up on Internet search engines before the actual hotel, which may lead some inexperienced travelers to believe they're clicking on a hotel site. Still, the reservations they make through his site are valid.""I do believe it's mostly a generational problem,"" he said. ""Most people will be aware. But it's still something we deal with weekly.""One of the most enduring ""wrong site"" examples is the National Park Reservations site, which is sometimes confused with the National Park Service site by consumers. It isn't affiliated with the national parks, a fact that it now clearly discloses on its front page, and it charges a fee for reservations made through the site.It's the first result on Google for a ""national park reservation"" search, but the site most people actually want is NPS.gov (go to ""Find a Park""), which doesn't have the fees. You can also book national park reservations, minus the fee, via an authorized concessioner such as Xanterra reservations.Hotels are fighting these third-party sites not just because of the customer confusion but also because they would prefer to take your reservation directly, without having to pay a commission. But their advice is still reliable. Take a hard look at the site before you book; otherwise, you could end up paying more or booking an invalid reservation.""Make sure you know who you are dealing with,"" Cope said. ""Third-party vendors often make promises they can't keep, and they likely can't help if something goes wrong.""Cope said even calling the 800 number isn't a reliable way to verify a site's identity, because the rogue sites claim to be the hotel's reservation desk.""You really need to be careful,"" she added.If you've been scammed by a fake hotel site, contact your credit card company immediately to initiate a dispute and then get in touch with the Federal Trade Commission to file your complaint. Because chances are, this problem will get worse before it gets better.After you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.

(Photo by James Sorensen/NBC/Newsmakers)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4badf1f00002e01242972.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an ideal world, we wouldn't use TV to suppress our emotions. But it's not an ideal world, so let's do what we need to do to get through the day! Binge-watching can be very helpful during a life crisis situation when you need to not feel your feelings and invest in a fake person's drama instead. This is all well and good (or actually, not good but we're doing it anyway) until you hit the last episode of the show, and your world away from your real life is suddenly no longer. You have to leave the West Wing. Or Stars Hollow. Or Lockhart-Gardner, or Capeside, or Pawnee. And go back to your own surroundings, with the credit card debt that's piling up and the texts you didn't respond to because actually locking down a date for the drinks you're supposed to have with your casual friend from college seemed so overwhelming that you just closed your eyes and sat on your phone as though that would make the row of emojis she sent self-destruct.Maybe your looming unaddressed problems haven't yet fully come back into consciousness. All you know for sure is when the episode cut to credits, your stomach drops like the one time you rode Superman after your friends peer-pressured you on a sixth-grade trip to Six Flags and you regretted it as soon as the coaster started its upward climb. (Trauma from middle school may or may not be a top thing we're repressing with television.)This gut-dropping feeling will usually be very uncomfortable and precipitate a period of grieving for the show you just watched. Yes, you're missing the series itself: after upwards of 15 hours a week of a show over an extended period of time, the characters really do start to feel like your friends (or FRENEMIES Paris Geller I'm looking at you) and the communities really do feel like your home (still dreaming of living in Capeside -- the creek by Dawson's house truly is picturesque.) But besides the actual show, you're probably also missing the safety of immersing yourself in a reality that's not your own -- which can make the withdrawal all the more painful. Fiction is powerful, you guys, and so is the human ability to repress! Your emotional stages will probably look something like this: 1. Denial    There's really no denying the fact that you've watched a series finale. But there are plenty of ways to deny that your time with the show is really over. If you've just spent months binge-watching a show that the rest of the world's already been caught up on, for example, you still have a lot of show-related media to consume ... right? ""I can read all the recaps!"" you might think. ""Let me find those those think pieces I bookmarked when I was worried about spoilers."" Then you will do this. Anxious feelings will begin to creep closer to the surface. Then you will discover DVD extras ripped to YouTube. You will watch all of those. Then you will find fan videos recommended by YouTube. You will watch all of those. And as the last montage of Josh and Donna scenes set to a Coldplay song ends, you will worry for a second that you've really reached the end. Then you will read some fan-fic.When your frantic googling of the show's title with various permutations of the word ""scene"" (""the good wife bar scene,"" ""the good wife elevator scene,"" ""the good wife car scene"") finally brings up all previously clicked links, you'll start to feel dread approach the center of your chest. But before it really settles in, your body's defense mechanisms will turn it into...2. Anger   With no new input from your TV show coming in, you're left at this point to consider all the ways the series ultimately wronged you. Why is that the way it went down with Luke/Lorelai, Will/Alicia, Pacey/Joey, Leslie/Ben or Jim/Pam? Why will I never be able to see what it looks like for Josh and Donna to be in a functioning relationship as adults who actually respect each other? I invested all that time and you're not even going to bring back Zosia Mamet's character for one single scene in the last season of ""Mad Men""? I acknowledge it wouldn't have really made sense but she was an interesting companion for Peggy.Eventually, your brain will realize this anger is all just because you're facing the reality of no new episodes. Then the fury will transition into disbelief at yourself.3. Bargaining  Why did I watch so many episodes so fast? I could have made this show last for three more months. I legit skipped my friend's boyfriend's birthday party to watch six episodes two Saturday nights ago. If I hadn't done that, I would have gone to a birthday party that it was really kind of a faux pas for me to miss in the first place and I would also still have six more episodes to watch. Why did I regularly stay up two hours past my ideal bedtime because I had to know what was going to happen with Pacey and Joey even though I walked around tired for literally a month? Why am I worthless.4. Depression  Remember how TV was distracting you from your real-life problems? This is a cool stage where all of those come bubbling up to the surface and demanding you take actionable steps toward fixing them if you ever want to stop crying on the subway. You may stumble around with dead eyes for a couple weeks and make bargains with the snooze button each morning. You might lie there and wonder what's going on with Rory's journalist life, or if she ever gets back with Jess. Eventually, you'll hit a point where you have to make some changes: find a new job, move to an apartment with cheaper rent, break up with the ""not a boyfriend"" sucking all the energy out of your soul. Hopefully this will give you a nice life reset, allowing you to move into new situations that are fine for a few months -- before throwing new crisis curveballs your way. This is when the delayed depression wave will hit. You thought you'd finally moved forward, but now you need your comfort show more than over. Things are looking very, very bleak.5. Acceptance  Then you'll find out ""One Tree Hill"" is on Netflix. You'll go to Season 1, Episode 1 and press play."

Some say the festival was devoid of great works of art, others complained about the Festival de Cannes typical bureaucracy, there were instance of what has been renamed ""Heelgate"" because women were turned away from red carpets for wearing flats, and the Italians had a strong presence, numbers wise, but perhaps their final products were a bit disappointing...All in all, Cannes was Cannes, a place for great films, meetings one just can't arrange anywhere else, insightful interviews and, in my case, it's a ritual by now, hugs. While last year I got a hug from a handsome stranger on the Croisette, this year two women filmmakers asked to hug me, one thanking me for what I'd told her about her film -- saying she would quote me from now on. Since I only tell the truth, and adore filmmakers for their passion and hard work, it was a pretty meaningful moment.Great highlights of this festival included an announcement by Emirati filmmaker Ali F. Mostafa (pictured above left, with Rami Yasin) who teamed up once again with Image Nation Abu Dhabi to direct a thriller titled The Worthy. Hollywood veterans Peter Safran (The Conjuring, Annabelle) and Steven Schneider (Paranormal Activity, Insidious) have come onboard to produce the project with Mostafa's regional producer embodied by Rami Yasin (From A to B, Sea Shadow). Mostafa's first action thriller will be set in a dystopian future, which has been plunged into chaos due to a chronic water shortage. Because of the drought situation in California at the moment, it's not a concept too far from the truth, and when a film touches on a bit of reality to go along with its entertainment magic, it's my kind of project. While on the subject of upcoming movies, Palestinian filmmaker Annemarie Jacir had two projects announced while she was in Cannes. Well, insiders maybe knew about them earlier, but for me it was double the surprise and double the joy. Since I watched her first feature Salt of This Sea, I've been following her career through to her poetic masterpiece When I Saw You, and Jacir has become a personal favorite. So, get ready for some wondrous filmmaking, with both her directorial effort titled Wajib, about an estranged father and son's attempts to reconnect -- starring favorite actor Saleh Bakri -- and with her company Philistine Films she'll co-produce Dictynna Hood's Trojan Women. Lead producer on this project is Georgina Paget of UK-based Refuge Productions and the film will star Hiam Abbass and Amr Waked. Speaking of women, what exceptional ones I met and/or reconnected with in Cannes! From lunch at the Majestic Beach with the ever elegant Shivani Pandya of the Dubai International Film Festival, sitting across from longtime inspiration, film journalist and now Mumbai Film Fest director Anupama Chopra, to catching up once again with Lebanese filmmaker Nadine Labaki, who sat on the Un Certain Regard with another incredible woman, Saudi Arabian director Haifaa Al Mansour. And then interviewing Chloé Zhao, who directed Songs My Brothers Taught Me, a film that touched me so deeply, things could have easily stopped there for me. But there was even a surreal late afternoon meeting with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and her director Sanjay Gupta, in town to promote their latest Jazbaa. Imagine me in pedi-less bare feet, on a yacht, while she was dressed in the most beautiful Oscar de la Renta gown I've ever seen, looking stunning. If you think Ash is beautiful in the movies, you haven't sat across from her. Wow.Men didn't lack though in Cannes. Thanks to my favorite group of publicists, I caught up with NYFF director Kent Jones, whose Hitchcock/Truffaut premiered in the Cannes Classics. Talk about a world of wisdom from two master filmmakers, made by a film lover, a package wrapped up into a beautifully assembled documentary, it was so anticipated I ended up not getting into the Buñuel theater. But I was in great company, with film curator Richard Peña and critic extraordinaire Manohla Dargis. Oh, while on this, I wanted to say, ""Cannes please hire another security firm next year!"" Shout it actually. The guys hired this year were bullies, unnecessarily mean and obviously needed some training in what's fashionable. Flats are in, they were shown by every luxury brand from Jimmy Choo to Christian Louboutin. And don't even get me started on Chanel sneakers OK?! Get over yourselves guys, a beige suit like the ones the Festival make you wear, does not make you gentlemen, as was so painfully obvious this year.Now that I've got that off my chest, there was another small issue in Cannes this year: Cons. One managed to get me to part with 10 euros on the Rue de Belges, while I ran to a screening I didn't get into... When the same guy, obviously a dumb con-in-training, tried the same trick on me again a couple of days later -- at the same spot on the same street -- I swung at him, without trying too hard and thankfully missed. But boy did it feel good to call him every name in the book.Finally, I was privy to a great presentation by Auro Technologies which showcased their 3D sound features, the acclaimed Auro-3D format. If you think the way you watch your movies doesn't have as much to do with the sounds that surround you, this presentation would prove you absolutely wrong. Auro founder Wilfried Van Baelen, who launched the company in 2010, was present to talk me through the way Auro-3D achieves a three-dimensional sound which is the perfect complement for today's digital cinema. Their tagline is ""Don't just hear a movie, live it,"" and when he showed a scene from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes using AuroMax I was hooked.All images used with permission. "

Bush after Obama spoke to a large crowd near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Saturday, March 7, 2015, in Selma, Ala. This weekend marks the 50th anniversary of ""Bloody Sunday,' a civil rights march in which protestors were beaten, trampled and tear-gassed by police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fb781f00000002257f3f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite the prolonged U.S.-led coalition bombing campaign, the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS) recently won victories in Iraq expanding the area under its control. In the wake of these advances, fingers of blame have been pointing in every direction. Democrats continue to blame President Bush for beginning the war, in the first place, while Republican candidates are attempting to turn the tables by blaming President Obama for abandoning Iraq. What is most disturbing is not the finger pointing, it is the degree to which the pointers have let politics trump history. In reality, Republicans and Democrats both share responsibility for Iraq's dismal state of affairs. The initial fault for this mess must be placed at the doorstep of the Bush Administration. They lied us into the war, dismantled Iraq's institutions and then badly mismanaged the occupation, attempting to restructure the country's governance by introducing a dangerously flawed system of sect-based representation.But the Obama Administration erred, as well. I agreed with the president when he observed that we needed to end the war in Iraq more responsibly than we began it. He inherited not only the war and the occupation, but an agreement his predecessor had negotiated with the Iraqis requiring U.S. forces to leave at the end of 2011. However, as I noted in early 2009, it wasn't the date we had to leave that was important. More important was what we were going to do in the three years we had left to prepare Iraq for our departure. And, in this, we did not fare well. It's important to recall where we and the Iraqi people were in 2011. In September of that year, I was commissioned to do a poll of Iraqi, Iranian, U.S. and broader Arab public opinion in advance of the U.S. departure. What we sought to learn was how all sides viewed the war and their expectations for Iraq following the U.S. withdrawal. The results were disturbing and foretold the crisis Iraq was to face in the future. In the report on the polls' findings I filed three and one-half years ago, here's what I observed: Most notable were the deep divisions among Iraq's three major groupings: Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs and Kurds. In the United States, there was a significant partisan divide. All these patterns played out in response to almost every question asked in the poll. For example, when we asked ""are Iraqis better off or worse off than they were before American forces entered the country?"" we found that Iraqis were conflicted, with about one-half of both Shia and Sunni Arabs saying that they were ""worse off,"" while 60 percent of Kurds said they were ""better off."" On the U.S. side, 58 percent of Republicans said Iraqis were ""better off"" -- completely disconnected from the reality experienced by most Iraqis. Only 24 percent of Democrats held this view. When we looked more closely at how the war had impacted many areas of life in Iraq, this division amongst the groups in Iraq once again came through quite clearly. Kurds, for example, said their lives had improved in every area considered, while overwhelming majorities of Sunni and Shia Arabs said that conditions had worsened. Judging from their respective views, it would appear that Republicans and Democrats were looking at two different realities, with Republicans seeing the war's impact as positive and Democrats largely judging the war as having made life worse for Iraqis.Americans and Iraqis were also divided on the prospects of the U.S. withdrawal. When we asked what emotion they felt when contemplating the departure of U.S. forces, three-quarters of Americans said they were ""happy."" But this emotion was shared by only 22 percent of Iraqis, with another 35 percent saying they were worried and 30 percent saying they felt both emotions. And while a majority of Shia Arabs and Kurds were optimistic about the post-occupation future, almost two-thirds of Sunni Arabs were pessimistic. The reasons behind this mixed Iraqi mood became clear when we looked more closely at the concerns they had for the post-withdrawal period. Almost six in ten Iraqis said they were concerned that the following would occur: ""civil war,"" ""the country will split into parts,"" ""increased terrorism,"" ""economic deterioration"" and the fear that Iraq ""may be dominated by a neighboring country."" Examining how Iraqis viewed issues close to home was also instructive. Six in ten Iraqis wanted a democracy, but six in ten simply didn't believe that democracy would work in their country. When we asked Iraqis to evaluate their leaders, we found that most were viewed as polarizing figures. Iraqi List coalition leader Iyad Allawi, who had won the 2011 election by a narrow margin, had the best overall rating of any Iraqi political figure receiving strong support from Sunni Arabs and Kurds. He, however, was only viewed favorably by one-fourth of Shia Arabs. Then Prime Minister, Nouri al Maliki, was more polarizing receiving support from only seven percent of Sunnis and 19 percent of Kurds. So, it was that at the end of 2011 America left an Iraq that was deeply divided. After decades of ruthless rule, Iraqis had endured an invasion and occupation, suffered from terror and ethnic cleansing and while the trappings of a democracy had been set-up, it remained in a gestational state. Iraqis appeared to both want the occupation to end, but had great concerns about what was to follow. In fact, when asked how long they wanted the Americans to stay, most Iraqis responded ""as long as your presence is needed"". The problem for Iraqis was that the American public wanted an end to the war -- only 22 percent were willing to stay ""as long as was needed."" At the same time, it appeared that while most of Iraq's Arab neighbors were neither equipped to help, nor would their help have been welcomed, Iran was willing and eager to work with allied parties and militias to fill the vacuum left by the American departure. The American people wanted to wash their hands of the situation they were leaving behind, and the American military, exhausted by almost a decade of two failed wars, was not interested in continuing to occupy the country -- especially in the absence of a Status of Forces Agreement that would legalize their presence. But even with that, Iraqis had legitimate concerns about the post-withdrawal period, and as we see with the crisis unfolding before us, these concerns were not unfounded. By not fully backing the more inclusive candidacy of Iyad Allawi to be Prime Minister, and by deferring instead to Iran's preferred candidate Nouri al Maliki, the seeds of the current sectarian conflict were sown. As it turned out, the dust had barely settled in the wake of U.S. forces departure when al Maliki intensified his crackdown against Sunni Arab leaders, deepening the country's already substantial sectarian divide.While American leaders were celebrating the end of the war and speaking glowingly of Iraq's new democracy, signs were pointing to serious problems on the road ahead. This was clear both from events on the ground and also from our poll results. The bottom line: Stop pointing fingers. There's enough blame to go around.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

After online commenters expressed their displeasure over the fact that the actor is playing a character who was blond and blue-eyed in the comic, the ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""Fruitvale Station"" star penned an essay in Entertainment Weekly addressing the topic: Sometimes you have to be the person who stands up and says, “I’ll be the one to shoulder all this hate. I’ll take the brunt for the next couple of generations.” I put that responsibility on myself. People are always going to see each other in terms of race, but maybe in the future we won’t talk about it as much. Maybe, if I set an example, Hollywood will start considering more people of color in other prominent roles, and maybe we can reach the people who are stuck in the mindset that “it has to be true to the comic book.” Or maybe we have to reach past them.After the essay was published, Jordan took to Twitter to thank fans expressing their support:""Fantastic Four"" hits theaters Aug. 7.

(WFP/Dina El-Kassaby)One of the few things that gives Syrians hope is the food packages from the World Food Program (WFP). When ISIS attacked Yarmouk, Syria last month it caused a major hunger crisis. Some families managed to escape to Yarmouk's outskirts. They can only survive with the food provided by WFP and its partner, the UN Relief and Works Agency. For some Syrians though, food remains out of reach because they are blocked from aid by the warring forces. The UN is demanding access to all Syrians trapped by the civil war. That is one of the tragedies that happens daily inside Syria. WFP and its partners stand ready with food to deliver, but cannot reach those in need unless the armies stand down. They try to negotiate humanitarian access each day. When WFP can get through they save lives. In fact, WFP was able to finally reach Syrians in Al Waer with food packages earlier this month. These were the first deliveries in months for the city. Throughout Syria, WFP provides an enriched peanut paste to children called Plumpy'Doz. This special food prevents deadly malnutrition.

But some of those words are really powerful and we need to take back that power.The ""f"" word -- Let's just call a fake a ""fake"" and get it over with. If you're my friend and you share a confidence I asked you to keep to yourself, then you are a fake friend. On the other hand, if you purchased your boobs, they are fake boobs but if you enjoy them, don't let anyone tell you that they aren't fabulous! Who the hell cares if genetics gave you those big knockers or you purchased them? I sure don't care. Enjoy.The ""n"" word -- ""No!"" is a very powerful word and one that most of us have been taught to rarely use since we were toddlers. But as toddlers, we knew the power of ""no"" and there is no other two-letter word that conveys such a clear and powerful message. Many ""no"" alternatives just dance around the essence of the word, such as ""I wouldn't recommend that"" and ""I don't think that's a good idea."" How about we revert back to saying, ""No!"" Just say ""no"" to someone and feel the power.  The ""c"" word -- ""Crazy"" may have been used unfairly in the past to refer negatively to people who had mental health issues beyond their control but ""crazy good"" is an expression we can all rally around. When you find an expensive item on sale that you were going to buy anyway, that is crazy good. When the person you have a crush on asks you out, that is crazy good. When the dog doesn't chew the sofa or has an accident when you've been gone too long, that is also crazy good. We should all appreciate the crazy good moments in our lives. The ""b"" word -- ""Bwahahahaha. . . . . !"" Who knew such an insignificant sound could actually become a word? And such a sophisticated word. Not only does it imply that you are kidding around but it also lets everyone know that you don't really believe what you just said. It usually takes a YouTube video to convey all of those nuances.  The ""s"" word -- Bodily functions, expletives and sex acts aside, ""sorry"" is possibly the ""s"" word that we should all say more often. As in, ""Sorry you are not crazy in love with me. Sorry you don't like my fake boobs! No, I don't want to see you anymore. I wouldn't recommend that anyone dive into your gene pool! But I wish you the best.

27,POLITICS,Why Obamacare Premiums Will Probably Rise More Quickly Next Year,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-premium-shock_n_7423912.html,,2015-05-23,"MIAMI, FL - FEBRUARY 05: Oreste Alvarez holds a sign directing people to UniVista Insurance company where they can sign up for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, before the February 15th deadline on February 5, 2015 in Miami, Florida. Numbers released by the government show that the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area has signed up 637,514 consumers so far since open enrollment began on Nov. 15, which is more than twice as many as the next large metropolitan area, Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fb6c2500008e013a5e8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Premiums in the the Affordable Care Act’s new marketplaces rose more slowly in 2014 and 2015 than initial projections had suggested they would. Don't bet on the same thing happening in 2016.Insurers have already filed official proposals for next year's premiums and, in states where those filings are public, some large insurers are calling for substantial, double-digit increases over what they are charging this year.These preliminary filings can be wildly misleading, not least because they represent a fraction of the states. Similar filings generated some hysterical headlines right about this time last year. Months later, with data from all the states available, researchers realized that, while premiums had gone up for some insurers in some states, they had gone down in others. The overall trend was actually much better than it had been historically. In the aggregate, that translated into an extra break for consumers, who pay the premiums, and for the federal government, which subsidizes less affluent consumers by offering them tax credits. But, so far, the requests for increases this year appear bigger than last year’s. More importantly, the insurers' rationale may reveal something about how Obamacare is playing out in the states where information is available. According to the insurers, the people who signed up for their policies in 2014 are running up higher medical bills than the insurers had anticipated. While that could be the product of temporary factors, it could also mean healthy people aren’t lining up for coverage in the numbers that either the industry or outside analysts had hoped.If that’s the case and if the trend continues, then insurers are going to have to start raising rates more quickly in the future, since carriers need premiums from healthy customers to offset the high costs of people with serious medical conditions. That will translate into higher costs for the government, as well as some consumers.“So far, the health law pretty much matched or exceeded expectations, with millions of people covered and costs lower than projected,” Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told The Huffington Post. “Whether that continues hinges crucially on insuring more people, particularly those who are currently healthy.”Reports of these large increases have appeared in several publications, including Investor’s Business Daily, The Washington Examiner and The Wall Street Journal, which conducted a comprehensive survey of rate proposals from a dozen states. Among the larger figures reported was a proposal from Tennessee’s BlueCross BlueShield, which is seeking increases in its plans that average 36.3 percent. In New Mexico, the average increase that Health Care Service Corporation has requested for its plans is 51.6 percent.Those are some very large numbers, although they come with some very important asterisks. For one thing, in many states, officials who must review these rates are likely to reject them. In Maryland, for example, CareFirst, the state’s largest carrier, sought increases of between 23 and 30 percent for its plans last year. But the state's insurance regulators said no way, forcing the carrier to accept increases of just 9.8 to 16.2 percent.This year’s requests from CareFirst look bigger than last year’s. By the time Maryland regulators are finished, however, the increases will likely be much smaller than what the company has officially sought. (It depends, in part, on whether Maryland's newly appointed insurance commissioner, a Republican and former insurance broker, is as aggressive as his predecessor was.) Meanwhile, Maryland consumers, like their counterparts around the country, also have choices. Cigna, Kaiser Permanente, and United all requested much lower increases than CareFirst did -- and Cigna is actually seeking a reduction. As health care blogger Charles Gaba wrote at HealthInsurance.org this week, “When you see a shockingly high 2016 rate hike splashed across a headline, take it with a huge grain of salt. It may be accurate, or it may turn out to be much ado about nothing.”The same variety that exists within states exists across them: Virginia’s largest carrier, Anthem, is seeking average increases of just 13.2 percent, according to the Journal. By contrast, the largest plans in Indiana and Connecticut have requested increases of just 3.8 and 2 percent, respectively. And even within specific markets, premiums will vary enormously from consumer to consumer, since most people who buy through the new Obamacare marketplaces are eligible for financial assistance. The amount of that assistance depends on two factors: the income of the person or family buying the coverage, and the prices of different plans relative to one another.Still, the requests from insurers certainly matter -- partly because the more they end up charging, the more the federal government has to pay in order to subsidize the price for consumers who qualify for financial assistance. (Under the Affordable Care Act, tax credits for health insurance are available to households with annual incomes below four times the poverty line, which, this year, amounts to $97,000 for a family of four.) So why might insurers be seeking bigger increases this year? One reason could be the normal and predictable competition among insurance plans jostling for market share, with larger plans more willing to shed customers and smaller plans eager to attract new ones. Len Nichols, director of the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University, thinks these market dynamics are an important part of the story -- particularly since, overall, the trend in health care costs has been toward relatively moderate growth. “Note how the largest proposed increases are from insurers with the largest market shares,"" Nichols said. ""I can believe costs were higher than expected, but not thirty-plus percent higher. Health services cost trends are too low, and actuaries would have been fired over that big a miss. This could reflect dominant firms losing their fear of new competition, or making their peace with smaller market share but with higher margins.”Another factor driving higher premiums could be anxiety over King v. Burwell, the lawsuit challenging the federal government’s authority to distribute health insurance tax credits in two-thirds of the states. The Supreme Court is likely to rule on the case around the end of June. If the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, thereby cutting off financial assistance in those states, millions will drop their coverage because they will no longer be able to afford it. That will wreak havoc with insurance markets, and not all states have signaled that they will let carriers modify the rate filings for next year.But the big question, and the one that will worry even staunch Obamacare defenders, is about the mix of customers -- whether insurers are attracting enough customers in relatively good health. It’s particularly salient right now because insurers are spooked by a new specialty drug, Sovaldi, that can treat hepatitis C, a disease that affects millions -- but costs $1,000 per pill and $84,000 per treatment. It also doesn’t help that some of the Affordable Care Act’s “shock absorbers,” designed to help insurers offset the cost of higher-than-expected medical expenses, will expire after next year. Clare Krusing, a spokesperson for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, told the Journal that “This year, health plans have a full year of claims data to understand the health needs of the [health insurance] exchange population, and these enrollees are generally older and often managing multiple chronic conditions. Premiums reflect the rising cost of providing care to individuals and families, and the explosion in prescription and specialty drug prices is a significant factor.”For now, nobody can really know what’s going on -- or, more importantly, what will happen in the future. Demand for medical services could taper off as newly insured people finish getting the exams and treatments they’d been postponing, which would suggest that the current surge in demand is a temporary phenomenon. Similarly, healthier people could come to the plans in greater numbers, as the system becomes more familiar and the penalty for remaining uninsured becomes more onerous. Or premiums could naturally settle at an affordable equilibrium -- perhaps with an assist from regulators, who sometimes, but not always, use the authority they have. (Insurers are making very good profits, so regulators would seem to have a case for challenging high rates.)Or none of these things could happen, enrollment growth in the marketplaces could stall and premiums could end up higher than expected. The only sure thing right now is that the story about premiums will play out differently in different states, as well as over a long period of time."

The event sponsored by the Republican Party of Iowa gave several Republican presidential hopefuls an opportunity to strengthen their support among Iowa Republicans ahead of the 2016 Iowa caucus. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fb73220000ba01dd860d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) proposed a measure on Friday that would shift budgetary power from Congress to the executive branch. The “Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act” was an amendment to legislation known as Trade Promotion Authority, which would give President Barack Obama the ability to ""fast-track"" international trade deals. Senators didn't vote on the measure as they rushed to finish work on TPA before a holiday recess. Paul's amendment would have empowered federal agencies to identify “any potential surplus funds” and return them to the treasury. Employees who tip off agency inspectors general to the surpluses would be eligible for bonuses. In order to create such a system, Paul’s amendment would give additional power to the executive branch by exempting the surplus funds from existing  law that forbids the executive branch from seizing congressionally appropriated funds. The 1974 law was a response to attempts by then-President Richard Nixon to unilaterally cut congressionally appropriated spending. A Republican Senate aide with close knowledge of the law, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Paul's language exempting the funds from the 1974 law may have been an unnecessary precaution. A Democratic Senate aide, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed concerns that the amendment’s language may have allowed federal government administrators to defund key agency functions for ideological or political reasons.Paul and a bipartisan group of senators introduced the Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act separately earlier in the week.Paul's office disputed the notion that his amendment would expand executive power.Jillian Lane, a spokeswoman for Paul, said Tuesday that inspectors general ""serve a vital role in protecting the taxpayers from waste, which includes purposely wasting money so that unneeded funds don't expire at the end of the year. It is appalling that some would seek to discredit inspectors general's integrity to protect their pork-barrel politics.""Lane noted that the Supreme Court had already ruled that the 1974 law protecting congressional appropriations from impoundment did not apply to unneeded funds. ""Train vs. New York (1975) clearly established that it was unconstitutional for the Executive to frustrate the will of Congress by withholding funds, but that if funds were unneeded, it was 'obvious' that the President would not have to spend just to spend,"" she said. ""Bonuses would in no way change this and strictly adhere to this precedent.""This story has been updated to include comment from Paul's office."

At least 37 people were killed in the gunfight in Mexico's troubled western state of Michoacan, in one of the bloodiest clashes in the country's drug war. Two police officers also died in the shootout in the municipality of Tanhuato, near the border with Jalisco state, a federal government official told AFP. Michoacan and Jalisco have endured some of the worst violence in a drug war that began to escalate in 2006, when the government deployed troops to combat cartels. More than 80,000 have been killed and another 22,000 gone missing nationwide in the past nine years. AFP PHOTO / HECTOR GUERRERO (Photo credit should read HECTOR GUERRERO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14d95240000360022a02d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alexandra AlperZAMORA, Mexico, May 22 (Reuters) - Government security forces killed 42 suspected drug cartel henchmen and suffered one fatality in a firefight in western Mexico on Friday, an official said, one of the bloodiest shootouts in a decade of gang violence wracking the country.National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said one federal policeman died and another was injured in the three hour battle on a ranch just inside the Michoacan state border with Jalisco, home of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-biggest city.The death toll was one of the heaviest to hit Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 pledging to put an end to years of gangland violence that have claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2007 alone.Government officials said the 42 killed by security forces near the town of Tanhuato were suspected members of the Jalisco New Generation (JNG) cartel, a gang based in the neighboring state that has seriously undermined Pena Nieto's pledge.The gunfight began after security forces alerted to an ""invasion"" of the ranch approached the 112 hectare property and were fired upon by a group of armed men, Rubido said.After calling in air and ground support, government forces ground down their opponents with the aid of a helicopter, in the end capturing three suspected gang members and seizing a grenade launcher and 39 guns of varying calibers, he added.Earlier, a government official told Reuters that two federal police had died in the exchanges near Tanhuato, where a week ago, federal forces replaced local police after the assassination of a candidate for mayor in a nearby town.Rubido said officials from the national human rights commission (CNDH) had been sent to the ranch, where the number of dead was the highest in any clash between the government and suspected gangsters since a controversial incident last June.Then, the government first reported that 22 gang members were killed in a shootout with soldiers in central Mexico. However, subsequent investigations showed that more than half of the dead had been executed, embarrassing the government. ELECTION LOOMSJalisco is one of the engines of the Mexican economy, but the state's southern border turned into a battleground between the JNG and the Michoacan-based Knights Templars, a gang whose leadership has been shattered over the past 18 months.Capitalizing on the Templars' losses, the JNG has become the biggest threat to the government, killing at least 20 police since March. On May 1, its gunmen shot down an army helicopter in southwestern Jalisco, claiming the lives of six military personnel.The gang also set vehicles, banks and gas stations ablaze around Guadalajara in a series of concerted attacks that day, shaking confidence in the federal government's ability to contain the violence ahead of mid-term elections on June 7.Pena Nieto's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party hopes to defend the slim majority it and its allies have in the lower house of Congress, with polls suggesting it could.
