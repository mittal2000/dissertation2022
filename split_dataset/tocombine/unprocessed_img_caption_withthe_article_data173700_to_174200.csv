(AP Photo/Eric Gay)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c74022200003000d93e09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I fell asleep during Monday night's debate. That makes four out of four. I nodded out during the discussion regarding the United States' relationship with Israel, and woke up to the talking heads declaring the victor. During the town hall-style debate, I fell asleep about three sentences before Romney's ""binders full of women"" remark. I didn't learn about it until I saw a couple of biting posts on Facebook the following day, and by then much of the moment had passed.  I wasn't always this way. I was once politically and socially active and engaged. In college, I tutored inner-city kids. During my third year of law school -- a time most students spend partying because their post-graduation law firm jobs are already secured -- I founded an on-campus human rights organization. Within months it had hundreds of members and was attracting prominent speakers.  But now? Frankly, I'm just too tired. I'm the mother of two small boys, ages 4 ½ and 23 months, and I work full-time as a corporate lawyer at a sophisticated New York law firm. My days start before the sun rises and, if they end at all -- because there are always middle-of-the-night wakeups to be had -- they end many hours after it sets.  Take Monday, for example. My little one was up at 5:30 a.m. All four of us were at the doctor's office for the kids' flu shots -- the boys dressed and fed, my husband and I fortified with coffee -- by 8:30 a.m. The doctor, of course, was behind schedule, and by the time the boys had been poked with needles and placated with lollipops, I knew we were going to be late for school. I handed the 23-month-old off to our babysitter, rattling off instructions about play dates and dinner, and ran to catch the bus to school with the 4-year-old.  My day was a series of back-to-back meetings and calls, the last one ending half an hour later than expected. My husband was out that night for a work event, which meant I had no flexibility -- I had to get home on time in order to let our babysitter go home herself. So instead of walking the 30 blocks, as I usually do, I hopped in a cab and shot uptown, arriving in time to usher the kids, as calmly and as lovingly as possible, through tooth-brushing, pajamas, stories and bed. Then it was back to the laptop for me, which I finally put aside just a short while after the debate had started.  All of this is in no way unusual, not for me, nor for any mom who works outside the home. There is no start or end to my workday, just as there is no start or end to the time when I'm doing the things I do for my family. I check my email first thing upon opening my eyes in the morning, seven days a week. I coordinate playdates, childcare and healthy dinners from my desk in between meetings. It's a revolving door existence, a constant shifting of gears from fast-paced businesses-minded efficiency, to gentle patience and nurturing and back again.  Sometimes it's incredibly overwhelming. Usually, I try to stay organized; my husband and I send each other Outlook calendar invites for all of our family members' activities, for example, so we don't have to worry about coordinating schedules. I rely heavily on my mother and mother-in-law, all-star grandmothers, who make themselves available for after school pick-up and babysitting on a weekly basis. I accept the fact that I will always have a domestic to-do list stretching weeks, if not months, into the future, and turn a blind eye to things at home that drive me bananas -- like the fact that we have been using a blanket as a window shade in my kids' bedroom since early September because I haven't had the time to deal with replacing the one that broke -- so that when I am home I can give all of my attention to my kids.  Most importantly, I try to focus on whatever is the highest priority at any given moment. When I am on a call with a client, it is that client's business needs and objectives. When I walk through the door at night, it is my kids and their day, their moods and their need for my love and attention. I move through the day in bite-sized increments, one after the other.  Oftentimes, the really big things, like national and international issues, get lost. Because I'm constantly putting my head down, focusing on the moment and the task at hand, it's hard to know when to lift it back up and look at the wide world. Of course I want my kids to grow up in a world that is kind and compassionate, with options and opportunity, and I know the choices that are being made in the national arena now are setting the stage for the world they will inhabit as adults. In light of that, I try to keep up with the big issues -- I read the newspaper as often as I can, keep the news on in the background in the morning and read the New York Times Magazine (almost) every week. Sometimes, though, I fail to keep up even with that.  The young, idealistic person inside of me -- the part of me that remembers constantly discussing the latest developments -- is appalled at my lack of engagement. But my and my husband's highest priority today is making sure that my kids themselves are kind and compassionate, well-adjusted little people who are well-taken care of. And there just isn't enough time for much else.  So I can forgive myself for having fallen asleep through four debates this election season... as long as I make a promise not to sleep through election night."

(AP Photo/Kathy Willens)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c74d72100003100c52202.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How many tears of working parents fell on keyboards today as they started their day reading the headlines and learned of the horrific killing of Lucia and Leo Krim at the hand of the person their parents entrusted to care for them -- their nanny?  Mine certainly did.   It had not been much more than 15 minutes earlier that I had kissed my son goodbye, thanked his nanny and waved goodbye to both of them as the elevator door closed and I headed off to work.  It's enough to be a working mother -- constantly inundated by the discussion of whether or not we can ""have it all"" -- and then to hear this awful tale that plants a seed of fear about how maybe you can't even trust the one person who, for those of us trying to do it, helps us keep it together. I respect every parent's choice to stay-at-home or not, but until today, I have never heard a more compelling case to do so.   I had a strong urge to immediately quit my job, fire my (no-reason-to-suspect-anything-like-this-would-ever-happen-with-her) nanny and say screw it to the thousands of dollars spent on a top-flight education and to the years of hard work invested in building a career. Screw it to trying to make it in New York City -- where for most families, dual incomes are required -- let's move to some less-desirable, less-expensive city, have a less-interesting life but rest assured that our children will be safe in our care at all times.   But I didn't, and we won't, do any of that.   I remember the first day I went back to work as a mother. I was lucky to spend his first four months at home with him and when the time came, we hired a lovely woman to be his nanny. Her references were glowing. There was no reason to worry but yet, crazy imaginations -- not too far off from the reality of today's story -- flooded my mind that day. How could I have left this most precious person with someone I barely even know?  Every day since then got easier. It is a reality that many parents are familiar with, and unless there are some radical changes in how Americans live and work, it is the way it is.   Nannies are a concept that is hard to understand if you live in a part of the country where they are not as common as they are for those of us in Manhattan and its surrounding areas -- just ask my family in Texas. In the discussion of women ""having it all,"" there isn't much talk about the role of caretakers and the essential role they play in a family. If you are a woman with career pursuits, who doesn't live near family, at some point, you will entrust your child to the care of someone you, truth be told, don't know very well. But over time, if you're doing it right, they should become like family.  That is why it was so amazing that when Amy Poehler was honored by TIME as one of the top 100 influential people in 2011, when she could have thanked Hillary Clinton or Lorne Michaels, she thanked her nannies for allowing her to achieve her success: ...it was the women who helped me take care of my children. It is Jackie Johnson from Trinidad and it is Dawa Chodon from Tibet, who come to my house and help me raise my children...Those are people who love your children as much as you do, and who inspire them and influence them and on behalf of every sister and mother and person who stands in your kitchen and helps you love your child, I say thank you and I celebrate you tonight.Today's news is incredibly disturbing. It's enough to make you question your decisions as a parent and our way of life. But it was a freak event -- and it's important to remember that most nannies care and love our children as if they were their own.   We'll hold our children much tighter this weekend. But come Monday morning, we'll kiss them goodbye, thank their caretakers and head off to work -- hopeful that they will be in safe and loving hands.

3,DIVORCE,Dating After Divorce: Do Single Moms Face A Sexual Double Standard?,"D. A. Wolf, Contributor

At thirty-something, she was a veritable man magnet -- smart, sassy and gorgeous. She was also divorced with two bright kids, an ex she couldn't abide and a socializing style that gave new meaning to the phrase, ""don't get mad, get even."" But her post-divorce dating habits? They caused me to raise an eyebrow.What bothered me was the speed with which men moved in and out of her heart (and bedroom) and how that impacted her children. She did not hide her love life from her kids.In fact, she fell hard and frequently. She would introduce the latest Mr. Right to her family right away and typically progressed from dating to engagement to cohabitation over the course of a few months. When she grew disenchanted, Mr. Not Right Enough was voted off the island -- and booted out of their lives. There was generally another suitor in the wings to take his place -- one more affair in which pacing herself in love wasn't a consideration; even promising relationships were doomed to fizzle. She repeated this pattern for years.I'd like to think I had no issue with her dating life per se. If anything, I was impressed -- even more so when I found myself divorced and alone with my own young kids. I began to understand the pain of doing it solo and the desire for a sex life, a partner and someone to share the responsibilities of family. Yet looking back, I know what I felt was disapproval. And I ask myself if my opinion wasn't unduly harsh. After all, women can be hyper-critical of other women, and we often make excuses for that all-too-common tendency. So what was my problem? The number of her sexual liaisons, their brief shelf-life, or genuine concern that her kids were caught up in her revolving door of emotional attachments? Would I have found it more acceptable if my friend was simply sleeping around, without the pretense of turning a hook-up into a household presence? Had she been a divorced man, would I have been equally judgmental? What about a widow or widower? In my own post-divorce dating days, I almost exclusively went out with single fathers. To my surprise, I found myself introduced to young sons and daughters as early as second or third dates. It struck me as odd. Was it a Litmus test before things progressed further? Was it nonchalance about the extent to which a child knew of his dad's private life? But I went out with them all the same, judgment free. My socializing was sporadic, given that my children lived under my roof about 95 percent of the time. But there were no casual sleepovers with my kids present, and when a relationship emerged with the potential for becoming serious, I discussed it with my boys and introductions were made in what I considered an appropriate time frame.I sound judgmental. Perhaps I am.This leads me to the following questions: • How are children of divorce affected by a revolving door of single parent relationships? How do we define that revolving door?  • If we're bringing casual sexual partners home, how do we know we're keeping our children safe, much less ourselves?  • If our social lives are private, is the revolving door a non-issue? • If we are judging, do we factor in the additional constraints of a parent who has his or her children all the time? • Are we in fact applying a double standard when it comes to single parent sex? Do we cut the single dads a break, but hold single moms to a different standard of conduct?  • Do we cut widowers even more slack?It's worth mentioning that when co-parents share custody, each has some flexibility to schedule dating or sex. The woman I describe did indeed have some ""adult time,"" but nothing close to a 50-50 split. As for me, I wondered if my near solo parenting status would condemn me to no social life whatsoever. I could manage a lunchtime coffee date, but babysitters weren't in the budget, and there were no family members to take the kids so I could go out. The challenges were many.When I did bring someone home to meet my boys, I was keenly observant of their reactions. I still am. When it comes to potential partners, kids have excellent instincts and we should pay attention. My sons are in college now, and remarkably, I find myself in a committed, monogamous relationship with a man I love. Perhaps because of that fact, I don't regret the way I handled my personal life and in particular, my sex life -- racking up some lonely years, and others requiring ""creative scheduling."" As I consider this issue of single parent sex and the impact on kids, I also revisit my experience with single and solo dads who more openly conducted their dating lives around their children. Why are we more likely to raise that critical eyebrow when a single mother does the same? Should we be raising the eyebrow in both instances, or is the issue more complex than that?  If adults are discreet and practicing safe sex, should any of this matter?As for my girlfriend whose flame burned brightly and died out quickly, I realize I was judging her choices, and yes, primarily because of her children. But I suspect that I carry remnants of a double standard all the same -- not when it comes to women and sexuality, but expectations of single mothers and what I view as their priorities. I have held single fathers to a different and lesser standard. This is a realization I'm not proud to admit."

According to the AARP, divorce for people over 50 has nearly double since the 1990's. Retirement and empty nest syndrome are often triggers for relationship tension that results in divorce. Adult children of divorced parents often take the news harder than one might think. Expecting your adult children to take it in stride is not realistic. Divorce can completely change the relationship dynamics; it challenges children's world views and they might start to question their childhood memories and struggle with guilt. ""My parents said they stayed together all those years because of me,"" is a common refrain. Adult children might view the situation as not just their parents separating, but rather that they are ""losing their family.""So how do we navigate the murky waters and preserve the relationship with our adult children? Try to understand what they are feeling. This can be hard because you are going through a very difficult time yourself -- your divorce. Understanding that this is a trauma for your adult children as well can make it easier to respond in a positive way to them. Your adult children might be angry at you, they might feel depressed or they might even try and fix the relationship for you. No matter how your child responds, do not try to rush them through their grieving process. Try to respect your adult children's boundaries. An interesting dynamic that happens with parents divorce with adult children is that the parents often heavily depend on the children during the divorce. Parents might forget that the children are grieving too. Your child may want to help but doesn't know how, or can't. Be aware that this might be difficult for them and look for other help if it is presenting a problem for your child. Do not talk badly about your spouse to your adult child. It may seem like they are an adult and can handle it, but keep in mind that they are not your confidante. Talking badly about your spouse to your child could lead to your child taking sides, or it could hurt their relationship with either parent. They may be mad at you for your comments, or they may side with you and be angry with the other spouse. Either response is not in the best interest of the family. Be sensitive to this.Reestablish that your love for them has not changed. Show your children with actions that even though you are not married anymore, you still are the same person that you have always been. If you used to be a good listener for them, continue to do so. If you used to go out to coffee, continue that routine. It can be rough, especially the first year after the divorce. Do not be afraid to seek counseling if you feel that your relationship with your children is severely damaged.  This post originally appeared on RevitalizeCounselingServices.com"

""This shows that home ownership doesn't guarantee financial security later in life."" (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c697b3c00004c0009bfbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A home purchase is a major -- if not the biggest -- financial investment for many people. Because it often involves a 20- to 30-year mortgage commitment, the finances of a home purchase can either really help or, sadly, hurt your security in retirement. Even for those in their early working years, home financing decisions now, and in the years ahead, directly impact your bottom line in retirement.For many reasons, I urge my clients to look at home equity as ""separate"" from the other assets in their retirement savings strategy. Since 2008, many of us have learned that real estate, particularly the value of our homes, may not be a dependable resource to tap. Home equity should be set aside and, essentially, parked during retirement. The over-use of reverse mortgages, second mortgages and home equity lines of credit in retirement have gotten many into financial trouble in recent years -- and can undermine a retirement plan. We want our homes to be our creature comforts in retirement and provide peace of mind. For most Americans, that means the family residence should not be considered a primary retirement investment. Additionally, real estate ""flipping"" is no longer a tool to jump start a quick and easy nest egg.On a positive note, we are living through some of the lowest interest rates since the 1950s, so now is a good time to assess your home financing and make adjustments to position yourself for a mortgage-free retirement. A disciplined financial strategy can lead to this, which can provide added mobility and flexibility. With no mortgage to worry about in retirement, you can downsize or move more easily -- and potentially improve your retirement finances.Here are three simple tips to help position you for a mortgage-free retirement.1. Don't take on more home debt than you can comfortably afford. If we learned anything from the recent past, it is the risks of taking on too much mortgage debt. If your monthly mortgage payments leave no financial cushion or ability to save towards retirement, it's best to reassess your plan. Generally, mortgage expenses should be no more than 28 percent of your monthly budget. Be particularly careful with adjustable-rate mortgages, which may begin with a lower, manageable interest rate that rises over time and may be ""interest only"" for a number of years, meaning that none of your monthly payments will be applied to your outstanding balance.2. Balance paying off your home mortgage with your retirement savings. You have a limited pot of money to draw from on a monthly basis, and many different financial priorities. Make sure that retirement savings are a priority in your monthly budget and do not get squeezed out by other expenses. Postponing retirement savings has a number of drawbacks. First, your money does not have as much time to grow. To illustrate this, one person starts contributing $100 per month towards a retirement plan at age 21 and, assuming a 6 percent interest rate, at age 65 has $258,426 in that plan. Assuming the same interest rate, another person who doesn't start saving until age 40 would need to put $372 per month into their retirement plan to end up with the same amount of money at age 65. The second drawback is you may be walking away from ""free money"" if your employer offers an employer-match program. Many employers encourage you to save for retirement by offering match programs and other conveniences such as automatic payroll deduction.3. Consider increasing your monthly mortgage payments. Opting for an accelerated payment schedule on your mortgage can take years off your mortgage. Paying your loan off more quickly means that you could retire mortgage-free, bringing more financial flexibility and less stress in retirement. And who doesn't want a stress-free retirement? Many lenders offer programs that let you bifurcate monthly payments into two smaller installments per month. This means you pay the same total monthly amount, but chip away at principal more quickly. Over 15, 20 and 30 years, this can result in significant savings.Unfortunately, with the retraction of the real estate market in recent years, over-inflated properties in many regions have lost value, mortgages have gone underwater and, in the worst of cases, people have lost their homes. Due to this turmoil, our perspective on home ownership -- as part of a long-term retirement strategy -- is normalizing. Our economy is slowly getting back to a more rational approach to real estate.With this in mind, retirees can view their home more realistically -- first and foremost as a place to live, and second as a more flexible but less critical asset to help deliver the retirement they desire.ING Retirement Coach Jacob Gold is a third generation financial advisor.

It was in a county courthouse, but I didn't care; I wore a $99.00 (not a typo) wedding dress proudly into the courtroom. The reception was in my backyard with home-cooked food. We didn't have much money, but we were young and very much in love. I should mention that my parents did not attend or approve of the wedding. My mother, especially, was not happy because she believed he didn't make enough money and wouldn't be a fit husband. She actually showed up at my reception with the police to have my maid of honor removed. The maid of honor was my sister. At the time she was only 15 -- she was removed because she was a minor, at the request of my mother. Fast forward to our one year anniversary, August 20, 2000. In the morning, you would find my husband and I getting ready for a very exciting day/evening in downtown Chicago. That is, until my phone rang and on the other end was my mother (who I hadn't talked to in a year) telling me to get to the hospital because my 16-year-old sister was on life support. She was in a very serious car accident. My sister Vicki recovered from the accident and my mother and I began to talk again -- a blessing in disguise. I wish the story ended here, but it doesn't. As a matter of fact, let's go to our three-year anniversary! Dare we celebrate?! Nope, back in the ER with my sister who at that time was 17 and now diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. I can honestly say my husband and I stopped celebrating anniversaries after this, but the bond between my parents and my husband and I was strong by this point. My sister Vicki fought her battle for six years, in and out of remission. At the end of her sixth year she was in remission and in good spirits. My husband and I started to discuss the idea of getting remarried in my mother's beautiful backyard like she always wanted, and it would be the wedding I dreamed of because my mother would lovingly approve and attend. Unfortunately, in May 2007, my sister lost her battle with cancer after seven years of fighting and thus began the grief and healing process. In 2008 we decided to think about planning our vow renewal but then my mom was diagnosed and lost her battle with cancer eight months later in 2009. My dad remarried mother's day weekend in 2011. So I thought, my turn! So here I sit, with wedding ideas on Pinterest, wondering if I should plan my vow renewal for 2014 to a wonderful man I met in 1996 and married in 1999. I have to say I am hesitant to go forth considering my luck in planning. My aunt was just diagnosed with Leukemia. Even though I may never throw myself my own wedding, I am still happily married to a wonderful man who, every day, tells me I am beautiful and that he loves me. He is my love, a love that I will love forever, who will never intentionally hurt me, is always there to listen -- a love that would die for me or die without me, my best friend, my best love, Andy!"

In need of a nightstand, and not wanting to spend any more money or add to the waste, Candela turned the old boxes into new furniture.His nit (Catalan for ""night"") nightstand is now eight months old (it was a Christmas gift for his girlfriend) and it is still standing (it's even had water spilled on it). Inspired by how easy the process was to upcycle his corrugated fiberboard, Candela created a simple step-by-step assembly guide that he has made available for free online so that others, too, could turn their furniture waste into side tables.All that is necessary are three 2.5 mm sheets of cardboard, a utility knife, a pencil, a triangle (optional) and a cutting board. You can download the plans for free off his website. Candela intentionally created them to be like those of IKEA because he wanted them to be easy to follow -- though he warns that until you're comfortable with the design it may take a couple hours to get the cuts right. Once the cardboard is cut it takes just two to three minutes to assemble... and disassemble... and reassemble.Watch Kirsten's feature-length documentary on tiny homes, We the Tiny House People: Small Homes, Tiny Flats & Wee Shelters in the Old and New World."

Think again! The crispness of fall is in the air, and it should be in your food, too, in the form of delicious chips made from seasonal, locally-grown foods. Here are a few fall staples that have amazing health benefits -- and that make fantastic chips. These aren't fried chips -- there's no real way to make that healthy! But if you bake the chips they are just as delicious, with none of the fat or health downsides. For each of the ingredients below, you'll preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and arrange the food on a non-insulated cookie sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle with olive oil and bake until crisp and slightly brown (though not burnt) -- this will be closer to 25 minutes for apples or pumpkin, more like 10 minutes for kale.With all of these fall chips in your repertoire, you'll have healthy snacks for the entire season.Manuel Villacorta is a registered dietitian in private practice, MV Nutrition, award winning weight loss center in San Francisco.
