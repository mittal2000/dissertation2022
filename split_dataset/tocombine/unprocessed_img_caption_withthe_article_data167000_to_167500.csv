Sometimes, I take them on special projects where they can build a house, feed a family or give their time teaching English in places that want to. But sometimes, I just take them on trips abroad with my family so they can experience a different culture. With all my writing on social media and the impact it's having on students, one thing is clear... The world is growing ever closer, every day.It's amazing to think that in the last 100 years, the world went from isolated imperialist cultures to a global neighborhood. With new inventions in transportation, communication and now emerging markets, it's imperative teenagers get to experience another culture as they grow through their own education. The benefits have far outweighed the costs. I've seen teenagers who've never met people of another culture, and when the lightbulb goes off, they learn how to communicate language, traditions and sometimes even faith. I've watched students who only knew of the world they grew up in, and all of the sudden they have a chance to match the history stories with real places.  I've also seen students who come from well-endowed homes see the rest of the world and how it functions. I remember on my first trip, I had a student who grew up like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. She had a maid, a butler and lived in a home twice the size of any castle I had ever visited. She wore the latest designer clothes, and most of the kids on the trip gawked at her lugguge. We went with a group of 15 students to Costa Rica. We lived in the Jungles of Costa Rica for eight days, working to help landscape a village. We went to the local church to see how the people of the jungle worshipped. We ate local food. We did what local people do. At the end of the trip, she said, ""I have everything I want, and if I want more, all I have to do is ask. These people have nothing (comparitively)."" She was about to get to her point: ""I watch these people so happy dwelling with family and community. But when I go home, I'm just going to be with more stuff."" It was at that moment I knew we were on to something.""Why are these people so happy, and I'm always depressed?""If it weren't for that trip, this young lady would continue looking for the next something to make her happy. You know, that something we all need. We have to have a new iPhone, a new wardrobe, a new car, a bigger house; and all the while, we think we'll find happiness there. And every time, we're left unfulfilled. This young girl learned early in her life that there are people who have figured out happiness void of the ""stuff"" the American culture says you need to be happy. I'll continue taking teenagers on trips around the world. Not so much so they can reach out and help someone else, although most of the time that happens. No, I'm taking students to expand their own view of the world in relation to where they are. One gift you can give your teenager before they graduate from high school is a bigger picture of the world. After all, it's only getting smaller."

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb1152100003000c53a0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I walked through the lobby of my office building the other day following some time off during the holidays, I noticed that the Christmas tree, the assorted little snowmen, the lights and other decorations were still up. I had a flashback to the time, many years ago, when my young children and I would gather together to put up -- and then take down -- the Christmas tree. It had become our little tradition. Until, that is, when it was no longer; when I had to dismantle it myself but just let it sit there, untouched. For a long time.Here's what happened: From my children's earliest years, on through my divorce and years as a single parent, we would gather together for a small party to decorate the tree. We'd join again to take it down on New Year's Day, sort of like bookends to the holiday season; a transition into the new calendar year. We accompanied both events with playing songs from my old Elvis' Christmas album, some treats for my kids and a big glass of wine for me. But over the years, my children grew and their interest faded. And it was hard for me to recognize and accept that. I may sound like a sentimental, aging midlife father, but I still smile to myself recalling how enjoyable our tradition was for us for many years. It went like this: A couple of weeks before Christmas, after we set the tree up in its stand, we would retrieve the large shipping carton that contained the ornaments and lights from the previous year. But before doing anything, we would bring out some homemade cookies for the children and some good Bordeaux for me. And then, to initiate our decorating party, I would begin playing Elvis' old Christmas album -- an original copy, which I had bought as a teenager.Though now in delicate condition, the old LP's sound remained clear and vibrant on the stereo. My kids liked Elvis' version of classic songs, like ""Here Comes Santa Claus,"" but also enjoyed his more adult rock numbers, like ""Santa Bring My Baby Back To Me"" or ""Santa Claus Is Back In Town,"" my own favorites. As Elvis sang, we began taking turns picking out ornaments to attach to those little wire clips for hanging on the tree's branches. Some had little loops built into them, which made it easier for small hands. Next were some hand-made decorations my older sister sent us each year, embroidered with my children's names. Finally, up went a few very old, fragile ornaments bestowed by my mother, probably of 1940s or '50s vintage. Some were thin, almost translucent bells; others, round colored balls so delicate they might crumble if you held them too tightly. The kids would argue about who would string up the lights first, of course. And then we'd top the tree with a Star of David -- a nod to their mother's heritage.So that was the scene for many years: Elvis singing in the background, a large glass of red wine for me and cookies for them (along with the occasional peppermint candy cane they snatched from one of the tree's branches when they thought I wasn't looking). Oh, and we'd have to keep shooing the dog away from lapping up the water in the tree stand. He seemed convinced it was his special water dish. On New Year's Day, we reconvened to take the tree down. The presents had been cleared away from beneath the tree by then, leaving it looking a bit naked and abandoned. It was a bittersweet marking of the end of school vacations and the holiday season. But, I liked making it into a transition, as well; to a brand new year ahead, one of new adventures and experiences. An ending and a beginning at the same time. With Elvis again providing background music, we carefully removed the decorations and put them back into their resting place for another year. Finally, I would carry the tree outside and dump it where the city would pick it up.The years passed. I see now that I wanted our little tradition to continue forever. In fact, change and transition had been steadily underway in our lives, all along. We were a family of divorce. The kids were getting older, moving from childhood interests and toys towards pre-teen awareness and then into adolescent awakening. Splitting holidays and vacations had become part of a new ""tradition."" Along the way, my children had become less enamored of our old one, especially when it came time to take down the tree. ""Oh, God -- Dad's about to play his Elvis album again?"" Or, ""Just start without me -- I'll be there in a minute; this movie's almost over."" It became an increasing challenge just to coordinate their schedules for doing the tree-taking-down thing. It was difficult finding a day or time when they wouldn't be out with friends or otherwise enjoying themselves before heading back to school or off to college. In truth, I was trying to hold onto the old experience whose enjoyment to them had been declining along the way. I wanted it frozen in place, forever. Of course, reality has a way of slapping you in the face, a bit harder each time until you take notice. As my kids would have said back then, ""Earth to Dad -- Hello!"" On one year, it became apparent that I was going to have to dismantle the tree by myself. My youngest -- the only one still in high school and still at home after New Year -- was already absorbed in the new semester. So I shouldn't have been surprised to hear him say, ""Hey, Dad, how about you dismantle the tree and then I'll carry it outside for you when it's ready?"" By then, it was shedding needles in droves, which were making their way throughout the house. Accelerated, no doubt, by my having not given it any water for several weeks.I procrastinated. I just let the tree just sit there, decked out in its Christmas array, looking like someone still dressed for a party long since ended. What I'm saying is that I really let it sit there. Until February. OK, late February. And yes, it was a total powder keg at that point. At that moment, I recalled from my own youth the story of a strange, reclusive family who lived a few miles from us. They still had their tree up well past Easter. One day, a family member's cigarette apparently set it on fire and it went up like a torch. The house burned to the ground in a matter of minutes. Perhaps my memory of that house going up in flames reminded me that life is constantly changing from something to something else, and that I needed to accept this small illustration in my life. So, one weekend afternoon I took down the tree myself, sans kids, sans Elvis. I quickly removed the lights and ornaments, packed them away, and then dragged the thing -- needles flying through the air, into my face, onto my coat; I didn't care at that point -- out the front door and onto the street.Actually, I had waited until the dead of night. I didn't want to deal with any neighbors asking why I was pulling this needle-shedding dead tree through the front door and out into the street two months after the city had finished collecting them. The lesson for me -- llifelong, needless to say -- was that anything you hope to keep permanent and hold onto forever -- a special moment of time, an experience that makes you feel truly alive, a relationship that you don't want to ever change -- you can't. Trying to do so is illusory, because everything changes; all is transitory. But that's not always or only ""negative."" It depends how we experience it; what we do with it.From that point forward, it became a bit easier to accept what my children did or didn't enjoy participating in with me as they grew older. And I began to realize that there are always new possibilities. For example, my intention to have a Quebecois-themed holiday party someday, replete with French-Canadian deserts made from handed-down recipes from my father's forebears. And, perhaps...my now grown-up children will enjoy being there.

It was something intensely private and personal, so I had a difficult time sharing it with people in my life. I joined an online forum with other women experiencing infertility and found compassion and support. I shared my story anonymously because I worried about medical privacy. Even with that support, I was still in pain.My husband suggested counseling and I balked. I was raised with a class-conscious and religious skepticism of psychology. It could be brainwashing or it could be a waste of money. Whatever it was, I had never known anyone who had gone to counseling. I thought I should be able to figure out my own problems. I thought it was a sign of weakness, of giving up, by going to ask someone for help with my own mind. People who really need help should go, I thought. Not me. But people who really need help are the ones who think they shouldn't need help. That they should be able to handle this. That counseling is for those who are really ill or really broken.Eventually, I felt so much pain that I was raw. I could no longer look people in the eye. I pushed myself, but sadness touched everything I did. It took courage, a giant push of gentle encouragement from my husband, for me to finally seek help. The first psychiatrist I went to wasn't a good fit. He saw himself as rational and objective, yet couldn't empathize with my emotions surrounding infertility. It took another push of courage to say this trained professional is wrong, but I still need help from someone else. My second counselor was a silver-haired social worker who practiced in a church office. A graceful Southern lady, she had experienced infertility too, but it was pure chance that brought us together. She was a life-saver. She supported me, gave me emotional tools,and provided invaluable perspectives.When a parent experiences pain now, we have many choices, but the one we choose makes a critical difference. We can blog about our pain or we can seek professional help. Experiencing problems with our children, being in constant emotional turmoil, feeling upset about our child's challenges -- those are natural experiences. It doesn't mean we are ill or broken. Writing about parenting pain online may feel good short-term, but its legacy is long-reaching. Sometimes, the things children do are borne of immature judgment and high emotions. Who wants, or deserves, those childhood incidents to shadow their lives?After my child was diagnosed with autism, I've done both. I've blogged and I've gone to a counselor. You know which one took more courage, more blind trust? Making that first phone call. Making that first appointment. Walking in that office and staying. Opening myself up to a counselor's suggestions. Getting that prescription filled. It took all the courage and faith I had, much more than clicking ""publish. ""Courage is admitting you need help, not that you need a blog. It takes courage to admit, seek and accept help in the right places."

During our visit we explored the vibrant city of Brussels and then we were on to Bastogne, where we visited the Ardennes and the site of the Battle of the Bulge. But before leaving Brussels we dined at some tantalizing cafes and restaurants, visited way too many chocolate shops and sampled some of its 500 (no, seriously, 500) different types of beer! Yes, we knew we'd end our trip facing our own personal battle of the bulge but hey, we were in the land of beer and chocolate and it was all too tempting to resist!Brussels is conveniently located less than an hour and a half from Paris and just two hours from Amsterdam. Home of the European Union and NATO, Brussels had its beginnings in the 10th century, evolving from a fortress town into a metropolis of more than one million inhabitants today. The city derives its character by the coexistence of French and Flemish culture and is now home to nationalities around the world which adds to its cosmopolitan flavor. It's further enhanced by picturesque medieval streets, lively squares, cozy cafes and a vibrant cultural life.After checking into my hotel, I made a bee-line for everyone's favorite place known as the Heart of Brussels: La Grand Place. With its sense of 17th-century power, this is one of 35 Belgian UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is a centuries-old square surrounded by the famed Guild Houses with their magnificent gables, pilasters, balustrades and ornately covered stonework. Here, also, adding to the happy atmosphere: flower markets, cafes, shops and people. Feeling somewhat jet-lagged from my journey, I spied a sidewalk vendor selling Belgian waffles. Something told me that this sumptuous concoction topped with whipped cream, chocolate and fresh strawberries would make me feel a whole lot better. It did.Sufficiently revived from my sugar jolt, I visited the Galeries St. Hubert on La Grand Place. In this fabulous glass arcade which opened in 1847 there are luxurious shops and beautiful cafes. I spent a leisurely half hour sipping coffee at Taverne du Passage and indulging in one of my favorite pastimes, people-watching. Before returning to my hotel, I treated myself to Belgian frites, twice fried potatoes that are served in a paper cone. I took mine with a side of mayonnaise. Highly recommended.You've Gotta Have Art Painting is one of the glories of Belgium and in Brussels you'll find more than 80 museums to house its splendid works of art. Not to be missed: The Royal Museum containing both ancient and modern art and the Belgian Center for Comic Strip Art, famous for its exhibits of Belgium's beloved comic strip character, Tintin, and those roguish blue guys, the Smurfs. The Rene Magritte Museum is dedicated to the works of Belgium's most famous 20th-century artist. It boasts the largest collection in the world of items related to Magritte. Some of his work is whimsical, some mystical, some surrealistic and others downright playful: ""Ceci n'est pas une pipe."" Oh yes it is!

Chocolate. At last count, there were some 2,000 chocolate shops in Belgium and 172,000 tons of this dark, delightful and de-lovely stuff are produced each year. All of the great chocolatiers are here -- Marcolini, Leonidas, Neuhaus and the aforementioned Wittamer's -- and if you want some sweet, in-depth browsing, check out the Museum of Cocoa and Chocolate.Beauty Lies in the Hands of the Beer Holder Three cheers for Belgian beers appreciated by ale enthusiasts in much the same way as fine wines. The variety of beer flavors is endless. Anyone in the mood for raspberry, chocolate, cherry, white or brown beer? You can find it here. The Belgian Beer Weekend held on La Grand Place takes place in early September, and there is the Beer Festival of Bouillion in April. If you want to forgo beer and try a cool, crisp Chardonnay, you're in luck. Brussels is a city of pubs, the oldest being L'Imaige Nostre-Dame which beckons your way by gaslight. Its tiny interior is all warm golden glow, stained glass windows, the dark wood of its tables and chairs polished smooth by centuries of use. At Au Bon Vieux Temps, it is, just like the name says, the good old days. Their motto is: ""Curiosity from the 17th century,"" and here you can try one of several curious and very drinkable aperitifs.We left Brussels to spend some time in Namur, an hour drive from Brussels and the capital of Wallonia. The city is quaint, cradled by the Meuse and Sambre Rivers, its architectural heritage dominated by a 1,000-year-old citadel. My colleagues and I shared a memorable lunch at Les Tanneurs de Namur which is both a hotel and restaurant. As we walked to the restaurant down a narrow alleyway, passing superb 17th-century restored buildings, anticipation built until we were standing right in front of the hotel's old stone walls, brick ceilings and stone archways. This building is a favorite among residents and tourists alike. While we were lunching, we saw two separate wedding parties that had come to be photographed amid its ancient splendor.A Solemn Visit After lunch, we were off to Bastogne, a few hours' drive and close to the Luxembourg border. This is the site where thousands of soldiers died during the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944-45. By the time fighting stopped, the city was completely destroyed, and more than 25,000 people had been killed. The town is filled with stark reminders of WWII, including the American Memorial, the Ardennes American Cemetery and the Bastogne Historical Center. We toured the Historical Center, one of the world's finest war museums with our guide, Henri Mignon, a man well-versed in this area's past, living here and following its history since he was a child. We were shown a movie which told the story of the Battle of the Bulge with some remarkable footage. There are 120 mannequins of American, English and German soldiers with their equipment and armaments, as well as uniforms donated by veterans of this most famous battle. There is also an important collection of light and heavy arms, photographic documents, personal objects and equipment found on the battlefield.Looking at the worn and sometimes bullet-riddled clothing and other intimate artifacts of the soldiers was incredibly moving, and we filed out of the museum silent and alone in our thoughts. Before leaving Bastogne, we spent some time at the American Memorial, an ultra-modern, star-shaped building set atop a hill and affording a sweeping view of Bastogne, the Ardennes forests and the battlefield, now quiet and meadow-like.Back in Brussels, the next morning dawned balmy and soft. I parked myself on a bench under a grand, sprawling chestnut tree in a small park and for a moment enjoyed the quiet peacefulness of this sometimes chaotic, multicultural city. But, soon enough, the pulse and tempo of swinging Brussels beckoned, and I was off to another adventure in this irresistible metropolis. Belgians invite visitors to come and experience their country through the eyes of natives. They promise that your experience will not be that of a tourist, so don't waffle about visiting -- Belgium is ready and waiting to make you its guest.For all information relating to this story: Belgian Tourist Office www.visitbelgium.com"
9,WELLNESS,Notes From the Couch: Movie Shrinks Make Me Crazy,"Toni Raiten-D’Antonio, Contributor
Author, lecturer, psychotherapist, and professor of social work",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shrinks-movies_us_5b9cb0dbe4b03a1dcc80ed88,"For me, movie portrayals of mental health professionals are generally infuriating, insulting and depressing.  Why would anyone reasonable invest the time and money going to see a shrink like the ones they see in films?  These depictions of people in my field are embarrassing.",2013-01-07,"This film image released by The Weinstein Company shows Jennifer Lawrence, left, and Bradley Cooper in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company, JoJo Whilden)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb0db2400005100534c6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Years ago, a young client of mine told me that she had no idea what her father did for a living. When she asked about his work, and she did ask repeatedly, his answers were always mysterious. He would say something like, ""I work for the government"" and give her a look that told her, ""Leave it alone."" In her adolescent mind, my client imagined her father as an undercover agent, living a seemingly-normal life in the suburbs, but always under great danger, protecting the nation. She was afraid for him, and chronically afraid that international terrorists might shoot up their home. He was unrelenting, though, in not revealing his true identity. Until he was dying. No kidding, this was a deathbed confession. What was his true occupation, that which had to be hidden, until his very end? He was an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service! My client's fears and imaginings of a dramatic, covert life of espionage were dashed. And why? Because the father knew that everyone hated tax auditors. They're seen as boring, pencil-pushing snitches. He couldn't deal with the risk of losing his precious daughter's admiration.Well, I went to the movies recently, and I'm beginning to feel like that guy. Or maybe an honest used car salesman. My husband insisted that we see Silver Linings Playbook because the reviews touted its accurate and gritty depiction of mental health issues. Since I'm in the mental health biz, I figured I should see it. Inevitably, one of my clients would want to know if I saw it, what did I think, and are they as crazy as those characters.So, I have to see a lot of television and film that depict shrinks. And as a college faculty member, I teach a lot of students who want to become ethical and effective psychotherapists. Often, they are delighted to see movies that show the therapeutic process so they can apply what they've learned, critiquing or emulating skills. And the truth is, I almost always have to give the assignment with the caveat that there will be more to critique than praise. (Someone out there, please let me know if you've seen a good therapist in a film other than Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People or maybe Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting.)The psychiatrist/therapist guy in Silver Linings Playbook is introduced after he deliberately triggers a violent, psychotic break in a patient (the film's main character) by piping a traumatic memory-inducing song into his packed office waiting room. The patient had just been released from a psych hospital, so it would make sense to put a whole room full of people's safety at risk, right? Or maybe just confirm to him that he was irrevocably insane and unable to live independently? What was that little ditty from Hippocrates? Oh yeah, right... ""Do no harm."" In my movie seat, I was already alarmed before ""Dr. Patel"" uttered his second sentence. When he finally engaged his patient, the doctor seemed to have only two moves (we call them interventions). First, take your medicine, and then develop a strategy for calming yourself when you're triggered. The doctor is cold and distant. Later in the movie, the patient runs into his therapist at a football game and is relieved when Dr. Patel reveals he is just a regular guy by calling the other fans and players ""cock suckers."" Last time I checked, that is not typically seen as a compliment. I kind of think it's bigotry against homosexuals and/or women. The whole therapy thing falls apart after that. The shrink winds up in the home of the main character, participating in the family craziness with no professional boundaries whatsoever. Game over. I can never assign this movie to my students.Is this what the therapists in Hollywood are like? Boundary-less, sycophants, with no skills whatsoever? If so, that explains a lot. For me, movie portrayals of mental health professionals are generally infuriating, insulting and depressing. Why would anyone reasonable invest the time and money going to see a shrink like the ones they see in films? These depictions of people in my field are embarrassing. Maybe from now on, I'll tell people I'm an auditor for the IRS.For more by Toni Raiten-D'Antonio, click here.For more on mental health, click here."
10,TRAVEL,3 Surprises Lurking In Your Airfare -- Bet You Don't Know What They Are,"Christopher Elliott, Contributor
Author, How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-surprises-lurking-in-yo_us_5b9cb0d8e4b03a1dcc80ece3,Your airline ticket isn't what it seems to be.,2013-01-07,"FILE - In this Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2010 photo, an unidentified passenger uses a Delta Airlines self check-in kiosk at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. Some passengers buying tickets on Deltaￂﾒs website this spring saw different prices just because they were logged into their frequent flier accounts. The Atlanta-based airline on Wednesday, May 16, 2012 said it has fixed the computer glitch but is unsure how many travelers were been impacted. The problem existed for less than three weeks and sometimes provided frequent fliers with high fares; sometimes lower fares, according to spokesman Paul Skrbec. (AP Photo/John Amis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb0d82400003200534c68.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Your airline ticket isn't what it seems to be.I'm reminded of that whenever I hear from readers like Heidi Fox. Her husband tried to switch his United Airlines ticket from Chicago to Orlando to an earlier flight on the same day, and an airline representative assured him he'd only have to pay a $75 change fee.But what the rep apparently didn't say is that Fox's husband would have to shell out a $744 fare difference, too.""It was only after he received the emailed receipt that he was made aware of the $744 cost differential,"" she says.For the better part of the last decade, airfares have been a reliable source of consternation and confusion. And with good reason. Airlines have built a business model around charging so-called ""ancillary"" fees and surcharges, or just not revealing all the details about your flight itinerary because... well, because they could.Some of the surprises are hiding in places you're least likely to look for them, from items that used to be included in the fare, like the ability to reserve a seat or check a bag to change fees to hidden incentives by the folks selling you the ticket.But 2013 may be the year we get answers.The Transportation Department is expected to unveil a proposed rulemaking in May that would, for the first time, require airlines to tell their customers about these unexpected extras. Reading between the lines of the ""Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections III"" rulemaking, it's interesting to see what the government thinks might be hiding in your airfare.It may not be on the airline you thought If you've ever booked a ticket on one airline but ended up on another one, then you already know about the not-so-wonderful world of codesharing. The government is considering adding new disclosure requirements to airline tickets being sold online. Right now, for example, you can buy a ticket through Delta Air Lines' website from Cleveland to Paris, and you might think you're flying on Delta all the way -- until you pay attention to the bottom of your screen. Your first flight isn't on Delta, but on regional airline Pinnacle ""doing business as"" a Delta Connection; your second flight from New York to Paris is not on Delta, but codeshare partner Air France. No Delta at all. Blink, and you might miss this little fact.Your fare may not have been the lowest available When you pick up the phone to call a travel agent or log on to a popular online travel agency, you might not be getting the best fare for you. Instead, they may be giving you the best fare for them. The government is considering a new rule that would require ticket agents to disclose any incentive payments they receive in connection with the sale of air transportation. On a practical level, that would be a prominent ""sponsored link"" next to an advertised airfare. But it could also mean that your travel agent would have to disclose any hidden incentive, bonus or ""override"" received in connection with the purchase. That would be interesting.Other fees may apply One of the most frustrating aspects of 21st century air travel is the myriad of airline fees we're faced with. They can easily double or triple the cost of travel, and they aren't always reasonable ($100 for a carry-on bag -- puhleeze!). The feds are considering a rule that would require additional or special disclosures regarding certain substantial fees, like oversize or overweight baggage fees. Depending on where in the booking path these disclosures come, it could affect your purchasing decision -- something the airline industry is desperately trying to avoid.I've sat face-to-face in a room with airline executives who declared these rules are completely unnecessary. For starters, it's difficult to find any industry in which prices and fees are this regulated, they say. What's more, their current disclosures are perfectly adequate and getting better all the time, so there's no need for the government to get involved. As far as travel agents are concerned, their bonuses are nobody's business.As a consumer advocate, I see things differently. My readers want to know how much their ticket will cost before they fly. Plus, they want to be able to compare prices across airlines, including baggage and seat-reservation fees, so they can find the best deal. They also want to know if someone paid their agent to push the fare they purchased. The only reason I can see that these parties aren't being more transparent is that they profit from withholding information.And that's not right."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that they are seeing significant increases in flu activity in the U.S. in the last two weeks indicating that an early flu season is underway and are encouraging people to get vaccinated. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb25a2100003100c53a8d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - When Dr. Diane Chaney arrived for her morning shift at the University of Chicago Medicine's emergency department on Monday, there were nine patients from the overnight shift waiting for treatment.By late morning, 36 patients, most with flu symptoms, were waiting.Across town, doctors at Rush University Medical Center have seen 203 flu patients since Nov. 5, compared with 119 patients for the entire flu season last year.""We are coming to the point where we are running out of testing supplies,"" said Dr. Ed Ward, an expert in emergency and internal medicine at Rush, a teaching hospital.Similar scenes are being played out in emergency departments across the country as the United States grapples with the earliest flu season in a decade.""The emergency rooms are quite full and it's clear that the annual flu epidemic is in full swing,"" said Dr. Brian Currie, medical director for research at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the proportion of people visiting their doctor for a flu-like illness has climbed from 2.8 percent to 5.6 percent in the last four weeks. That compares with 2.2 percent during last year's mild flu season and a peak of 7.7 percent during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic.Dr. Daniel Lucey, who tracks global flu activity at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, said people naturally reflect on the past year's flu season as a measure for the severity of flu, making this season appear all the worse by comparison.Even so, he said, ""it's an objective fact that flu viruses are circulating earlier and more widely this year than most years.""Lucey and others say it's not clear why the flu arrived earlier than normal in the United States this year.Although each season is unique, flu activity generally starts to pick up in December, peaks sometime in January or February and peters out by late March or early April.One risk of an early flu season is that it arrives before people have had a chance to get vaccinated.That may be especially true following last year's very late and mild flu season, which may have led some to think they had more time. Experts, however, say it is not too late to get a flu shot.""We strongly encourage people to get vaccinated, and we'd like them to do that as soon as possible,"" said Dr. Michael Jhung, a CDC flu expert. VACCINE IS BEST DEFENSEThe predominant strain of flu this year is an influenza A (H3N2) virus, which has accounted for 76 percent of the reported viruses.""We know H3N2 has been associated in previous seasons with pretty severe illness, particularly among the elderly. That could be a contributor to why we are seeing such high levels of activity right now,"" Jhung said.Currie of Montefiore suspects the H3N2 strain may also pose more of a risk for younger people, who ""don't have as much experience with that strain.""Fortunately, flu experts did a good job last spring of predicting which of the flu strains circulating in Asia would be most likely to cause disease in this flu season. As a result, the CDC says the current batch of flu vaccines appear to be a good match for this year's flu.So far, 91 percent of flu viruses analyzed by the CDC match flu strains contained in this year's vaccine.""The viruses that we're detecting are like the viruses that are in the vaccine, so there should be good protection,"" Jhung said.Earlier this year, manufacturers estimated they would make 137 million doses of vaccine, and by early December, the CDC had vaccinated an estimated 112 million people, suggesting vaccine coverage is fairly high so far, Jhung said.Even if vaccinated, people may still get the flu. Experts, however, say the vaccine will help reduce the severity of the illness, and may help reduce the number of deaths, which can range from a low of 3,000 to a high of nearly 50,000.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said even in healthy young people, the flu vaccine was only 70 to 80 percent effective. And in older adults, the vaccine only protects about 60 to 65 percent of those who receive it.But it is still the best defense against flu.""Study after study after study shows that the influenza vaccine reduces the risk of getting sick and getting any of the other significant complications of the flu,"" Schaffner said.

As we get older there's more travel, more dinners to attend, more work to do. It's all rewarding and usually a lot of fun, but as we all know, there's no substitute for a home-cooked meal, and for a lot of us, part of that satisfaction comes with cooking it ourselves. As the amount of personal information we can share with each other invariably increases, we find ourselves fascinated by the eating and cooking habits of even those we don't know. It got us to thinking especially about the well-known chefs, musicians, comedians, actors and others whose career frequently takes them out on the road, into more airplanes, restaurants and hotel bars than they can count. When they finally settle back in at home, what do they want to cook for themselves? We asked, and they just started telling us! For our inaugural installment of Homecoming Meals, we talked to the host of Food Network's ""Chopped,"" Ted Allen. Allen is no stranger to the kitchen, nor to the have-to-be-in-three-places-at-once lifestyle. Known first to us as the Food and Wine Connoisseur on Bravo's ""Queer Eye,"" Allen has gone on to author cookbooks and generally remind us what kind of food we want to eat. After giving us some tips for stress-free holiday entertaining, we asked Ted what his ideal Homecoming Meal would be.Weather permitting, I want to go in my backyard and smoke a pork shoulder. I’m a very slow food person. I love cooking things that take a long time to develop flavors, many of the best foods require a lot of time (which is one of the reasons “Chopped” is so hard for Chefs, they have such a limited amount of time to put together an amazing dish).
