David Maurice Smith/Oculi.)--Not since the horror of World War II has the planet seen a forced migration the size of the Syrian diaspora that began three years ago when seemingly innocuous government protests escalated into a bloody civil war. The subsequent implosion has left 9 million Syrians displaced, 2.5 million of whom have fled across borders into neighboring countries as refugees.The Kingdom of Jordan has taken in over 600,000 Syrians since the fighting began, struggling to house the unanticipated numbers of new arrivals in refugee camps whose resources have been pushed well beyond their limits. An estimated 80 percent of the Syrians in Jordan have hunkered down outside camps, fending for themselves to avoid the poor conditions and detainment associated with camp life. The trade off: Outside the camps Syrians have less access to the aid on offer and are more susceptible to the unsavory forces attracted to those in positions of desperate need.Wherever Syrians have found themselves, in addition to having lost their homes and their livelihoods, they are saddled with the emotional traumas inflicted by witnessing their communities destroyed and families and friends senselessly murdered. While proving challenging beyond all initial estimates, the difficulty of providing logistical solutions to their influx will pale in comparison to the greater long-term task of healing these deep wounds.This post is the first of two parts by Oculi collective photographer David Maurice Smith documenting Syrian refugees in Jordan, initially looking at those living outside camps in the urban areas near the Syrian border.-- An elderly Syrian woman, face marked with traditional tattoos looks out the widow of a rented house in Azraq, Jordan.

And yet seniors by the thousands end their days like my dad. I read recently that scientists in Britain had been able to stop brain degeneration in mice. It is a major breakthrough, though it will be years before we will know if there are applications for humans.",2014-05-20,2014-05-12-1450054_10200858179959957_1179374473_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-12-1450054_10200858179959957_1179374473_n-thumb.jpg,"On Sunday I took my daughter to see my dad. It had been a while, so she had asked to see him. I was a bit hesitant. I have been going once a week to visit with him and while physically he has stabilized, mentally he continues to go downhill.There is less of the man he was before remaining each time I see him. He is someone I do not recognize most of the time.His affect is agitated. Almost hostile. He does not welcome visits. There is little-to-no conversation when I do go to see him, and he makes it clear when he is ready for me to leave.His behavior is increasingly bizarre. He becomes obsessed with things that are not reality -- but it is impossible and ill-advised to attempt to reason with him. He dresses and undresses frequently, wanders around aimlessly, and continues to spend much of his time in bed.The majority of the time, when I arrive my dad has been wearing nothing more than an adult diaper. So I felt the need to prepare her for that possibility. At first, when I explained how sometimes adults can require diapers, she laughed.Then she became serious and said, ""BaBop is someone very special to me. I am not going to laugh at him for wearing a diaper. I love him.""As we entered the facility where he lives, a man was also arriving with two young children. My daughter smiled and greeted them. Then she said, ""My mommy's daddy has dementia. We are coming to visit him.""When we went it was late afternoon. Not typically a good time for my dad or anyone with dementia. Thankfully, he was doing fairly well. He was dressed and sitting in his chair. He recognized my daughter and embraced her.My father does not display positive emotions at this point. I have not seen him smile or laugh or appear happy for some time. But I could tell he was pleased to see her.He did become irritated as she went around the room touching his things. He doesn't like that and I did my best to keep her from doing so. The visit was short, as they all are now. But it went well. I'm glad they had the opportunity to see each other again.There were many hugs and kisses.As we were leaving, I noticed the man in the room next to my dad was clearly near death. There was a hospice nurse sitting in a chair just outside the door. His family members were beside his bed, stroking his arms. Music was playing in the room.A woman I guessed to be his daughter came out as we were leaving, and ended up walking to the parking lot alongside us. I was wearing a St. Louis Cardinals hat, and she turned out to be a fan from southern Illinois.Before we got to our car, I built up the courage to ask, ""Is that your father next to mine?""""Yes. Is that your dad? He is so sweet! He comes in and asks about my dad regularly.""""I sense you are coming to the end of your journey.""""We are. It won't be long now. He has had nothing to eat or drink for five days.""""I'm sorry. Your family will be in my prayers. I understand what it must be like. We thought we would be in the same place with my dad by now.""""Thank you,"" she replied. ""It will be a blessing when he goes. This is no way to live, and he never would have chosen it.""""Neither would my dad,"" I said, nodding.It is something no one would ever choose. And yet seniors by the thousands end their days like my dad. I read recently that scientists in Britain had been able to stop brain degeneration in mice. It is a major breakthrough, though it will be years before we will know if there are applications for humans.The news offers no hope for my family today, but it does for many who could possibly be spared from this hell. And for that I am happy.This post originally appeared at The Writer Revived. It is part of a series I am sharing here concerning my family's journey with dementia. My father passed away March 10, 2014.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

The star of A Million Ways to Die in the West says, I go home to the house I share with my sister,"" she says. ""The minute I walked in the door, my sister said, 'Hey, Amanda. There are dishes in the sink that are growing plants, and do your laundry.' Then I heard, 'By the way, your dog just ate half a bag of kitty liter. Will you please clean up the dog vomit?'""We do get testy with each other -- and I love it,"" says the friendly Seyfried, who grew up in Allentown, Pennsylvania. She began to model at 11 and then did a stint on the soap opera All My Children. Seyfried made her screen debut in 2004 in the hit Mean Girls.Her beauty tips are simple: ""I only wash my hair every few days,"" she says. ""I use Kevin Murphy Fresh Hair dry shampoo in between if I feel oily."" Among her favorite shampoos include Bumble and Bumble's Crème de Coco shampoo and conditioner. Another favorite product is her concealer stick from Cle de Peau. ""It's not greasy and does the job,"" she says, mentioning she also loves Cle de Peau's Gentle Cleansing Foam and their SPF 23.

Seyfried is rarely in the tabloids. Her personal life doesn't make headlines, which is the way she likes it. ""I think the most important thing in a relationship is to be heard,"" she says. ""The guy should make you feel beautiful and important. I tell girls if you don't feel that way then just go hang out with your girlfriends.""She says it's not that tough to fit a private life into her work life. ""I'm not that overwhelmed,"" she insists. ""The only thing that's hard is talking about myself so much, which just seems ridiculous to me. It's a little bit too much of me, but it's part of the job."" To get away from the job, she likes to strum her guitar or pick up some knitting needles. ""By the time a film wraps, I have everyone on the set knitting,"" she jokes.At home in LA, the normal life continues in the wake of her stardom. Seyfried says it keeps her sane and from becoming some spoiled diva. ""It's beautiful,"" she muses. ""I'll joke with my sister and tell her, 'Hey, I'm a film star.' Her response is always the same.

We do watch. Most of us don't change the channel. Why?,2014-05-20,"FILE - This file photo taken from video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network, Monday, May 12, 2014, shows the missing girls alleged to be abducted April 14, from the northeastern town of Chibok. A Nigerian government official said ""all options are open"" in efforts to rescue the almost 300 abducted schoolgirls from their Islamic extremist captors as U.S. surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft started flying over the West African country. (AP Photo/File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baebfc62200003401db0cf0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why do we care when we see the Nigerian schoolgirls who are the prisoners of Boko Haram? We do watch. Most of us don't change the channel. Why?There is nothing that ordinarily might catch our eyes: no one is badly injured, beautifully dressed, or posing in a sexy way. And no one is asking us to do something: give money; write a letter, or anything else. Usually when we are shown suffering somewhere else in the world, like the Japanese tsunami disaster, we are asked to donate to those in distress. When it comes to the schoolgirls, we can only feel compassion for them; there is nothing we can do to help them.While we watch the Nigerian story, many of us imagine the despair, anger, and frustration that the parents of those poor girls must be feeling. Even if we aren't parents ourselves, we feel a concern for those desperate mothers and fathers. When I became a parent, I felt that my heart had been opened; I became concerned about the welfare and suffering of all children, not just my own.Global CompassionWhen we see those captured schoolgirls on the screen, we feel what I call ""global compassion."" Despite our cultural and linguistic differences, we are able to feel the pain of their situation. What we do share is a sense of common humanity; they are fellow human beings, and they and their parents are suffering.In the history of human existence, the capacity to witness the suffering of totally unknown and faraway people is but a blip, a moment in our time on this planet made possible by technology. Compassion was shaped as a human characteristic for family members; the Dalai Lama and Charles Darwin both thought the mother's compassion for her child is the seed of compassion. We don't have to learn it; it is given to parents.Familial and Familiars CompassionWhen I lived and worked in an isolated preliterate culture in New Guinea 57 years ago, they were still using stone implements. It was not possible to witness the suffering of total strangers. Instead, compassion was felt for members of their own family, fellow villagers, or related tribes. I called this ""familiars compassion."" Although the research has not and cannot now be done, I suspect that everyone in that culture felt both familial and ""familiars"" compassion and never had an opportunity to experience compassion for strangers, for there were none.Compassion in Today's WorldToday, even though we can observe the distress of others far away and unlike us, not everyone feels ""global compassion."" Some do, but generally, when the victim appears different from us in every way, fewer of us feel moved to take kindhearted action.Perhaps the Nigerian schoolgirls are an exception, overcoming the usual obstacles to compassion because their plight touches on our own hardwired parental concern. The pull is unavoidable. Or maybe it is just the novelty that grabs us; have we ever before seen so many young girls kidnapped?More about the nature of compassion can be found in Paul Ekman's new ebook Moving Toward Global Compassion. Additionally, new videos of his discussions on compassion with the Dalai Lama will appear on the Paul Ekman Group website soon.

6,FIFTY,Retirement Overseas: Are We All Just Waiting for the Grim Reaper?,"Suzan Haskins and Dan Prescher, ContributorInternationalLiving.com Editors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/retirement-overseas-are-w_b_5331857.html,"San Miguel is a more affordable place to live than is Santa Fe. And for many years now, San Miguel has been one of the top destinations on the ""retire overseas circuit.""

That's no small feat when you consider that other cities on the list include places like Rome, Paris, Venice, and Vancouver.  Photo from InternationalLiving.comStill, it's remarkable that the top 10 are cities like San Miguel that are mostly smaller and less known than the Romes and Parises of the world. Think Budapest, Salzburg, and San Sebastián, Spain. (Charleston, South Carolina ranks #5 and the only other U.S. city to rank in the top 25 is Santa Fe, New Mexico, coming in at #17. Quebec City makes a good show at #10.)When it comes to ""best,"" people seem to have a thing for manageable cities with cultural and historic flair. And that, of course, describes San Miguel perfectly. As Conde Nast writes, ""The lack of street lights and billboards makes the region romantically and historically beautiful, and the city itself offers a traditional feeling of a small town in the heart of Mexico.""And we don't care what media-inspired preconceptions you may have of Mexico, San Miguel feels a blessed world away from border issues and drug violence. In some ways, San Miguel de Allende is comparable to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Both are located in high-elevation, high-desert types of terrain. And both were settled by Spanish colonialists, lending a magical look in terms of architecture and infrastructure. And both cities attract their share of artistic types and Baby Boomer retirees. Sometimes these groups are one and the same.But San Miguel is a more affordable place to live than is Santa Fe. And for many years now, San Miguel has been one of the top destinations on the ""retire overseas circuit."" We lived there ourselves for a few years and we'd happily return to this enchanted place where life is slow and easy, and filled with art, music, literature, and like-minded company. So it's also no wonder that San Miguel is also attracting younger people... those in their 30s and 40s who also want to wrap themselves in the alluring arms of San Miguel and all it offers.As our friend Warren Hardy tells us, he had a conversation recently with one of these younger newcomers to San Miguel who said this:""You boomers are coming here to die. We're coming here to live.""To which Warren responded, ""No, you're coming here to work. We're coming here to play.""But here's the thing: Warren and Tuli moved to San Miguel in 1990, when they were young romantics themselves, looking for a way to make a living... yes, to ""live"" in paradise. And live they have. (They're still romantics, and although 24 years older, they are definitely young at heart.)They have a beautiful home with a breathtaking view of the village where they entertain often. They travel frequently in Mexico and elsewhere. And they founded the Warren Hardy Spanish School in San Miguel--one of the best language schools on the planet and offering, for our money, one of the best and easiest systems for learning Spanish. So the idea that Warren and Tuli moved to Mexico to await the grim reaper is, frankly, laughable. But what about the rest of us baby boomers? Those who are moving now to expat retirement communities in far-flung corners of the world? Are we doing this to prepare for our departure from said world? We think not.This is something we know a little bit about. We've talked face to face with hundreds, if not thousands, of people facing retirement. And some who have been retired for decades. You'd be surprised, in fact, by the number of 80-year-olds we've met... older than our own parents... who are eagerly on the trail of new adventures and experiences. They're all exploring the endless opportunities ahead of them and deciding what to do with themselves in this glorious ""final chapter."" But not a single one of them is ready to close the book on living.They're certainly not off to places like Thailand, France or Panama in search of a place to die. If that's what they wanted, it would be far easier and more comfortable to just stay at home in the easy chair, remote control in hand and a pot pie in the oven.Instead, the adventuresome boomers we know are teaching English in Nicaragua or growing organic vegetables in Ecuador. They're going fishing in Costa Rica or mushroom hunting (yes, that kind) in Mexico or on spiritual quests in Peru. They're piloting small barges through the waterways of Europe or living in small riverside villages in Cambodia. This is the new normal. Even if all we do on an afternoon is snuggle in a hammock or sip an espresso at a sidewalk café with a neighbor, it's routine daily life for those of us who live overseas. And it has nothing at all to do with waiting for the Grim Reaper. If he wants us, he'll have to find us first, and we're at least one step ahead.

I perused the 30th Annual Science Olympiad National Tournament on May 16-17, 2014 at University of Central Florida's campus in Orlando. Certainly these 2,000+ students competing for 120 teams were not thinking about Harry Potter rides or Disney's FastPass, but rather focused on their latest contraption and how it will succeed in record time.Robo-Cross These Robo-Cross miniature bulldozers were innovative: some with scoopers, others with pinchers, and one with a unique rotating paddle that smacked in Lego pieces. Perhaps the girl-and-boy team whose robotic apparatus had one of its two motors fail will someday ameliorate the design of a single or twin engine Cessna... Maybe the 2-boy middle school team - whose robotic front end loader was controlled by Blue Tooth from their smart phones and then choked during the gathering of one tennis ball, a few ping pong balls, AA batteries and tiny 1x4 Lego pieces - will re-engineer future John Deere tractors.Rotor Egg Drop In UCF's Engineering 2 Atrium, Clarissa's Rotor Egg Drop gadget departed the 3rd Floor stair's launch pad towards the ground floor below, but spiraled farther away from its original axis of rotation and then crash landed on the 2nd Floor landing. Clarissa was devastated! As she exited the stoic staircase, her family rushed over to comfort her. As an engineer standing nearby, I complimented her cool, aerodynamic design.Through her creative genius, she assembled her Rotor Egg Drop's buoyant device with balsa wood, cellophane and a handy glue gun, and then spritzed with sprayed adhesive. I asked her if she ever thought about becoming an engineer. She said ""No"" but chimed about being a ""neuropsychologist."" I encouraged her to consider biomedical engineering at Columbia, though she uttered other schools like Stanford. So much for my alma mater recruitment...As one of 90 classmates at Mount Vernon Middle School (Mount Vernon, Iowa) who made it to nationals, Clarissa competed in not only Rotor Egg Drop, but also Metric Mastery, Anatomy and Heredity. Her Mount Vernon Middle School had been to the national tournament two or three times before; however, this year the Sunshine State gleamed brightly on Mount Vernon, garnering its best ranking ever.It turns out that Clarissa's dad and I are both civil engineers. He works for Braun Intertec in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and deals with heavy flat construction (highways), while I inspect mostly vertical new construction (office buildings, stores and recently seawalls for a new subdivision) in Florida. He and I shared a geeky common outlook: we both appreciated how these students were able to conceptualize, design and construct a device - with specifications, of course - to perform certain tasks, yet in a timed race. He boasted about how his daughter exhausted 20 to 30 hours per week recently to prepare for this contest. I hope to see this bright-eyed apprentice back again next year competing at the national Science Olympiad. With her civil engineer father by her side, Clarissa is sure to advance in the world of science. Boomilever After watching a couple of experiments in the auditorium, I squinted my eyes and realized that the two boys of India descent are representing Thomas Jefferson High School for Science & Technology (Fairfax County, Virginia) - that's my older niece's school (which is ranked 4th in the Best High Schools by U.S. News & World Report)! As a structural engineer, I was mesmerized with Boomilever and later complimented the TJ boys on how structurally well-designed their bottom chord with trusses really is. These 10th graders did not think they would medal... Sitting in front of me, one of the boys' cousin Andrew is a Launch Engineer with Spacex and works in Cape Canaveral on ""Rocket Road"" - is that cool or what?! If only Andrew could be a visiting coach for the trial category Airjectory, where teams construct and calibrate a device that launches a projectile towards a target. Helicopters Later I scurried to the Arena a bit sweaty and discombobulated... I stood and watched patiently the Elastic Launched Glider competition. Protected by safety goggles, the two-girl team flung their glider up into the 38' high atrium. Their airborne vessel soared angelically around a few times, coasted and then made a gentle touchdown. Meanwhile, I got distracted by the herd of turquoise-shirted 13-year-olds barreling down the 3-story Arena stairs. Yes, that Longfellow Middle School (Falls Church, Virginia) team just set off its twirling non-motorized helicopters directly above me. Longfellow was the second to the last team to compete in Helicopters. I missed what I had raced over to watch. Awards Ceremony After dinner with my younger niece ""N"" and her Longfellow teammates at Sweet Tomatoes, I was back at the UCF Arena (a mini Madison Square Garden) where students were dressed up in suit-and-tie or lovely dresses. The Awards Ceremony was like a combination of the Oscars and American Idol finalists, except the presenters were accomplished engineers or scientists, yet the winning students were treated like rock stars! Even one presenting sponsor confessed that he had competed at the national Science Olympiad and was proud to award the Solar System's Top 6 (including cash prizes to the 1st Place team). He proclaimed that someday the first person to land on Mars may likely come from students competing at the 2014 Science Olympiad National Tournament. As an anxious auntie in the bleachers, I think that my 11th grade niece ""M"" from Thomas Jefferson High is drained from her recent AP Exams, while my 13-year-old niece ""N"" at Longfellow Middle experienced the sobering 7th Place at nationals in 2013 - only the Top 6 students earn medals of honor...Entomology category was up, and they announced Top 6 winning school teams in Division B (middle schools). My niece ""N"" won 4th - in the nation!! When Entomology was heralded for high schools (Division C), I quickly learned that my older niece did not medal - my heart sank...When Longfellow's team was awarded a medal for Experimental Design, I jumped for joy because that was the team of my niece ""N"" - woo-hoo! Congrats to the middle school teams who won Preakness-like trophies: Beckendorff Junior High (Katy, Texas) for 1st, Winston Churchill (Carmichael, CA) for 2nd, and Daniel Wright (Lincolnshire, IL) for 3rd! As a first time observer, I predicted that Harriton (near Philly), Mira Loma (Sacramento) and Troy (Fullerton, CA) would be ranked in the top ten overall high school teams. Sure enough, Mira Loma placed 4th, Harriton won 3rd and then the confetti showered over the grand trophy winners from Troy High School.So the students from Munster High (Indiana), Frontier Middle (Washington) or Science & Arts Academy (Illinois) may not have seen Minnie Mouse or Shamu on this trek to Orlando, but their adventure was surely magical. Their eyes opened up more to the world of science and engineering. Hope more new teams form and take advantage of using Lockheed Martin volunteer mentors to coach their students. Perhaps we will see more techie aficionados and aspiring engineers competing at the 2015 Science Olympiad National Tournament at University of Nebraska-Lincoln! "

9,BLACK VOICES,"Eric Holder Cues HBCU Advocates to Focus on ""Subtle"" Racism","Jarrett L. Carter, ContributorFounding Editor, HBCUDigest.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-holder-cues-hbcu-adv_b_5351624.html,"Education is the last and most precious commodity in the ongoing pursuit of social justice, and African-Americans should consider more seriously the notion of access to better facilities, racial diversity and larger classes being false signs of opportunity and equality.",2014-05-20,"WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 10: Assia Richardson, standing, waves to family members as she takes her seat for Howard University's commencement with special guest Sean Combs on May, 10, 2014 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badfa8d3c000032000b5965.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder last week commemorated the 60th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision during a speech at Morgan State University's spring commencement exercises. Like most speeches made by members of the Obama Administration on historically Black college campuses, Holder's message was intended to reverberate with African-Americans, and for everyone else, to serve as a highway marker on the long journey to equity.With a fitting blend of personal reflection, political promotion and social critique of the years, which followed the alleged end of segregation in American schools, the nation's top attorney addressed more than 900 graduates of Maryland's flagship HBCU; the key institution at the center of a successful lawsuit against the state for maintaining a ""separate but equal"" system of higher education between its predominantly white institutions and four historically Black universities. He talked about the difference between racism that offends, and racism that displaces people away from opportunities, access and prosperity.Without directly mentioning the Maryland HBCU lawsuit or other attacks on HBCUs by way of federal and state neglect, Holder's remarks should signal to all HBCU students, alumni and supporters that now is the time to press on matters of the nation's criminal mistreatment of its historically Black institutions.Since the era of Brown, laws making classifications based on race have been subjected to a legal standard known as 'strict scrutiny.' Almost invariably, these statutes, when tested, fail to pass constitutional muster. But there are other policies that too easily escape such scrutiny because they have the appearance of being race-neutral. Their impacts, however, are anything but. This is the concern we must contend with today: policies that impede equal opportunity in fact, if not in form.In Maryland, the notion cost HBCUs more than 40 years and billions of dollars in lost students, research contracts and private gifts that may have come if the schools were allowed to keep unique programs in engineering, computer science, business and nursing. All of these things were lost under the banner of the University System of Maryland claiming false efforts to bolster minority access, while simultaneously forcing HBCU students into deplorable learning conditions and cultural and professional dissonance for wanting a historically Black education.Florida's flagship HBCU faces similar attempts on its signature joint engineering program with Florida State University, where legislators approved, then launched a study of a split to create two engineering schools directly across the street from each other. There is little to learn in studying the inefficiency of two pipelines of funding and infrastructure development, all on the dime of Florida taxpayers. But with the objective of making FAMU's program appear inferior to the FSU program, legislators believe their efforts will cause an eventual and swift merger of the program into FSU's school in just a few years.In Louisiana, the Southern University System has survived a merger attempt on its growing commuter campus in New Orleans, and the financial exigency of its flagship campus in Baton Rouge. Grambling State University was pushed into one of the most embarrassing chapters in HBCU sports history, as a result of its own executive arrogance, but with drastic state budget cuts as the original sin.The symbolism and timing of Holder's address will likely serve as the first notes in a crescendo of attention for Maryland's landmark legal decision that, in 2014, could very well attract the same kind of attention and purposeful governmental response as Brown v. Board caused 60 years ago. Education is the last and most precious commodity in the ongoing pursuit of social justice, and African-Americans should consider more seriously the notion of access to better facilities, racial diversity and larger classes being false signs of opportunity and equality.Students, alumni and supporters must not let dramatic program and funding cuts in North Carolina be overshadowed by a few new programs in the state designed to quiet HBCU advocacy. In the face of millions of cuts, a few hundred thousand from the governor and senator isn't enough to keep HBCU doors open or constituent mouths shut. In South Carolina, we should hold lawmakers to the promise of more from the same state government, which has not yet responded on the question of South Carolina State University being, essentially, too important to fail.Nationwide, there remains so much work to do in saving HBCUs, with little time and even fewer resources to aid in the cause. But without discussion, without increased advocacy and awareness of the HBCU struggle in the Black American public arena, Holder also describes what is next for those who prioritize and plan for the future of our institutions.Of course, talking forthrightly about these difficult issues -- and building a constructive and inclusive national dialogue -- will not by itself be sufficient to address them. But it's a necessary first step that must lead to action. Our most serious and systemic challenges are too often dismissed, or oversimplified, or blamed on politics. But we do ourselves and our great nation a grave disservice whenever we reach for easy answers or revert to stale talking points; whenever we fall victim to old paradigms and traditional habits of thought; and whenever we trade the noisy discord of honest, tough, and vigorous debate for the quiet prejudice of inaction -- and the cold silence of consent."

People who know and love those artists think of them nostalgically now, but in their prime they were very popular, and they were pretty open about their sexuality. Much of their music (in my opinion) was realistic in a way Beyoncé's music is not. How many people have asked their driver to put up the partition before getting it on? Not me. Beyoncé is all about control, and because of that she may be the best entertainer on the planet right now. Sensuality can be about control, sex can be about control, but the idea of losing yourself in another person -- I don't get that when I listen to Bey.I should say as a disclaimer, I don't mind all of the love given to Beyoncé because she deserves it on the basis of her talent alone. What gets to me is how hard feminists and generally intelligent women grab onto not just Beyoncé, but her sexuality specifically. The way I feel about it is kind of like what Spike Lee said about Brooklyn, or what Kara Brown said about Jen Selter (Instagram's butt selfie girl). This is not new. People, women, strong women, have done this before -- perhaps more authentically. Beyoncé's sensuality is just easily accessible right now.Most of the talent I mentioned, TLC, Aaliyah, Janet, were popular at a time when performance was not extrapolated and dissected the way it is now on the internet. All That existed on Nickelodeon with one of the most diverse casts on TV (without the show being ABOUT said diversity), TLC told us they were not too proud to beg for sex (I can't imagine that going over well with the internet today), Aaliyah rocked back and forth before she turned 16 (which is probably why Drake and so many other men romanticize how ""down"" she was), Salt-n-Pepa kept it real about the risks of casual sex in ""Let's Talk About Sex"", and Janet was keepin it real all around about how to get down. All of that happened in the first 5 years of the 1990s (don't get me started on a 90s-were-the-best tirade). Also, it is important to note that Beyoncé expressed her sexuality in many songs before this most recent album, but that was before her marriage to Jay-Z.My qualm with the Beyoncé fever now, or Mrs. Carter, is that we as a society didn't celebrate her celebrating her sexuality until she was ""successfully"" (I mean successful here in many ways) paired with a man. Rihanna has always been open about her sexuality, but she's often written off as a party girl, rather than a woman who happens to be very cozy with her sexuality because she was raised outside the bounds of American patriarchal/ puritanical culture.There's also an element of equality in this '90s contingent that some men feel is missing in feminism today. Too often when a woman asserts herself sexually or otherwise it is interpreted by men (and many women) to mean she does not need a man. I think that's why people like Beyonce so much right now -- she is pretty neatly wrapped up in the traditional sexual structure we think is appropriate (i.e. heterosexual marriage, although some people still have a problem with that, but that's a whole other can of crazy). But if we go back and look to the old Janet or TLC or even sassy Salt-n-Pepa, you'll hear appreciation. You won't hear them giving men praise simply for being men, but what you WILL hear is women taking about how much they love their man because of what he can provide, sexually or otherwise, and that appeals to me. I am interested in a partnership where both partners are giving and taking, and to me, those songs embody that idea.Mainly because of the Beyhive, and partially because I have tons of friends I respect very much who love Beyonce, I feel the need to tie this up once more by reiterating that I DO NOT HATE BEYONCE. In fact, I have said on multiple occasions that I think her presence is definitely a huge positive for the world. That said, she is not necessarily doing something new by being independent, owning her sexuality, or even being a superb entertainer. What she has done, though, is start conversations like this one, which is one of the best things an artist can achieve. So right on girl! I'd just ask my fellow feminists and non-feminist Bey supporters to take a few steps back and acknowledge that this landscape was cultivated before she came onto the scene, and maybe there is some room in there for ladies like me who don't see themselves in Beyoncé's music.This post was originally published at courtneymckinney.com.
