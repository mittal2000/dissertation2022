He, and several concerned civilians, had been trying to catch the dog since early that morning. When Gallardo rolled onto the scene, the officer was trying to lure the pup with food but the tactic wasn’t working.“The dog was too smart and kept running through the parking lot,” Gallardo told The Huffington Post. She felt compelled to help, but wanted to let the officer do his job.Yet, as she continued to eat, she noticed the pooch’s cat and mouse game was getting dangerous. The tiny dog would occasionally lie down for breaks and whenever he did, a passing car would almost hit him.Gallardo decided she needed to help. She drove up to the dog, opened her door, stepped out and offered him her hand. As she approached him, he calmly laid on his stomach. She was able to bend down and scoop the dog into her arms, leaving the entire lot in shock.“The officer was amazed by how submissive the dog was towards me,” Gallardo said.She handed the dog over to the officer and he was taken to Baldwin Park Animal Shelter. But Gallardo -- who describes the Chihuahua as “the sweetest precious baby” -- wanted to make sure the feisty fur ball would find a loving home sooner than later. So, she shared her story on Facebook, alerting her friend John Hwang. Hwang lives by Baldwin Park Animal Shelter and goes there frequently to take pictures of needy dogs and then posts the pictures online in hopes of finding them homes.“I just do it for the love of dogs,” Hwang, who has four rescue pooches himself, told HuffPost. “I figure that I could use my photography to bring more awareness.”Gallardo’s post struck Hwang and he decided to visit the shelter to photograph the Chihuahua.Hwang spent about an hour with the dog before he decided to take pictures.“He was actually quite friendly,” the photographer said. “But he also looked very restless being in that kennel. He kept pacing back and forth, almost like he was trying to find a way to get out.”Hwang snapped a few shots when the dog decided to do something that really surprised Hwang.“He got up on his hind legs, put his front paws together and shook them up and down, as if begging me to help him.”At first, Hwang thought this action was just a fluke. But the dog continued to do it.“He would pace back and forth in the kennel then come up to me on the fence and do it again,” he said. “It really touched me.”Hwang posted the moving photos on his Facebook page.The little guy is still begging for his freedom and deserves something more than a fast food parking lot.If you, or anyone you know in L.A., is interested in adopting him, check out his adoption page at the County of Los Angeles’ Department of Animals Care and Control. You can also call the shelter at (626) 962-3577. His animal ID number is A4910211.Keep in mind there are plenty of other dogs that need to be adopted as well.

But it is not the first flower grown in space, as was announced by astronaut Scott Kelly in a tweet, and as was reported here and elsewhere.The Washington Post notes that while the latest blooms are ""the first grown from start-to-finish in an official NASA mission,"" flowers have bloomed on the ISS before. Astronaut Don Petit, conducting an unofficial experiment in 2012, documented a ""space zucchini"" that bloomed in the company of a sunflower on the space station.Before that, in the early 1980s, a Soviet cosmonaut managed to get blossoms from a batch of rockcress, Gizmodo notes, an accomplishment that's listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""first species of plant to flower in space."" Space.com, however, tracked down an account of a unmanned 1966 Russian space probe that carried a crop of haricot beans that sprouted and flowered.Previously:This flower is out of this world. The 13-petaled orange zinnia is the first ever to be grown in the zero gravity of space. And after a rocky start to its life on board the International Space Station, it appears to finally be blooming.U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly proudly tweeted a snap of the plant on Sunday. ""#SpaceFlower out in the sun for the first time! #YearInSpace,"" he wrote.""Yes, there are other life forms in space!"" he added in a later post.Kelly is right to be pleased. The zinnia's flowering is a landmark moment in science and also testament to his hard work in saving the specimen after it nearly died.On Dec. 27 he tweeted a sad image showing the plants leaves' curled and covered in mold. ""Our plants aren't looking too good. Would be a problem on Mars,"" he wrote.According to a NASA blog about the experiment, the seed containers were leaking and the plants roots' were being flooded.After vowing to channel his ""inner Mark Watney"" -- the stranded NASA astronaut Matt Damon plays in ""The Martian"" -- Kelly quickly set about reviving them.He changed the watering of the plants and instead of following a strict schedule just topped them up when he felt they needed it, according to Engadget.""If we're going to Mars, and we were growing stuff, we would be responsible for deciding when the stuff needed water,"" he said at the time.After a hairy few days when some of the plants ended up dying, he succeeded in nurturing a couple until one flowered.The dead flowers will be taken back to Earth and analyzed, per the NASA blog.NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid grew wheat stalks on the Russian Mir space station in 1996 and others have successfully grown lettuce in June 2014 on the ISS. But this is the first time a flower has bloomed. ""The zinnia plant is very different from lettuce,"" said Trent Smith, project manager of the ISS Veggie facility. Smith said they were ""more sensitive"" to light characteristics and had a longer growth duration of 60 to 80 days.""Thus, it is a more difficult plant to grow, and allowing it to flower, along with the longer growth duration, makes it a good precursor to a tomato plant,"" Smith added, according to NASA's blog.Alexandra Whitmire, of the NASA Human Research Program, said growing plants in space could raise crew morale. ""Plants can indeed enhance long-duration missions in isolated, confined and extreme environments -- environments that are artificial and deprived of nature.""Scientists will continue to monitor the zinnia crop. And, according to Engadget, the next step in producing organic space food could be sending tomato seeds to the ISS in 2018.Also on HuffPost:"

7,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Releases Health Plan And It's Even More Ambitious Than You Thought,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-health-plan_us_569c3ddde4b0b4eb759ecf51,The proposal comes after days of sparring with Clinton.,2016-01-18,Bernie Sanders is going big and bold with his health care plan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569c3e372a00002c00030aa2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bernie Sanders on Sunday released his plan to reform the American health insurance system -- or, more accurately, to reinvent it from scratch.It's a plan to create a single-payer health care system, which means the government would provide everybody with insurance directly. Sanders is calling it ""Medicare for All,"" because Medicare, which provides government-financed insurance to the elderly, is the closest thing to a single-payer system in the U.S. But that term actually understates the ambition of what he is proposing.Sanders wouldn’t just replace existing private insurance plans. He would also replace existing public plans -- including Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Plan and the private plans available through the Affordable Care Act. He'd even upgrade the coverage that Medicare provides. To pay for this plan, Sanders would replace existing insurance premiums with taxes and put a huge squeeze on the drug industry -- the kind that would be extremely difficult to push through the political system.And while Obamacare has produced a historic decline in the number of uninsured Americans, the Sanders plan would reach many, if not most, of the remaining uninsured (roughly 10 percent of the population, according to recent estimates) through automatic enrollment.“Universal health care is an idea that has been supported in the United States by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman,” Sanders said. “It is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on earth and guarantee health care to all citizens as a right, not a privilege.”Sanders introduced his plan just hours before a nationally televised Democratic presidential debate, and after days of back and forth with Hillary Clinton, front-runner for the nomination. Clinton, who like Sanders is a longtime champion of improving access to health care, has said she prefers to proceed incrementally -- mainly, by bolstering the coverage that Obamacare guarantees and putting more pressure on the drug industry to lower prices.Sanders would go far beyond that. In place of existing arrangements, Sanders would offer coverage that, on paper, looks a lot more comprehensive than any other coverage widely available in America today. The insurance that Sanders proposes would basically eliminate copayments and deductibles, except for cosmetic surgery and other elective procedures that a board of medical experts determined to be medically unnecessary. (People could still pay for those services on their own.) Coverage for Medicare, the one program Sanders would leave in place, would become more generous, since today it does not offer such extensive benefits.According to an independent analysis by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the Sanders proposal -- if enacted -- would pay for 98 percent of the typical person’s medical bills. “This is a very generous plan,” Friedman told The Huffington Post. “Doing away with copays and deductibles is a big idea.”Sanders says that his proposal would actually save the country money -- first, by eliminating all the money that the private insurance industry spends marketing and managing its plans, and generating profits, and then by reducing the money doctors and hospitals must spend on billing. The plan would also seek deep discounts from the drug industry. Overall, according to Friedman’s analysis, the Sanders proposal would reduce health care spending in the U.S. by $6 trillion over the next 10 years.Because Sanders is eliminating all existing insurance, he’d also wipe out the premiums that people now pay to finance these plans. In their place, he’d impose a new “income-related premium” of 2.2 percent, a payroll tax on employers equal to 6.2 percent of wages, and then a series of new tax hikes on the wealthy. These taxes would be in addition to the payroll taxes that people already pay for Medicare, a Sanders spokesman confirmed.In the end, Friedman found, a family with income of $50,000 would end up saving more than $5,000 a year relative to what they would spend in the current health care system.Whether other independent analyses come to the same conclusion remains to be seen. But the challenge of single-payer has never been whether, on paper, such a plan could deliver comprehensive benefits to all Americans at a low price. It’s whether such a plan could survive the political process -- and how its implementation would play with the public. For example, Sanders envisions huge savings from lower drug prices, but efforts to extract far more modest savings from the industry have failed repeatedly in the past. And while programs like the Veterans Affairs health system get steep drug discounts, they also operate strict formularies limiting access to drugs -- something that many Americans would probably find objectionable.“One can certainly design a single-payer plan on paper that saves money for the middle class by reducing payments to doctors and hospitals significantly and shifting the financing of health care from premiums to a very progressive tax structure,” Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said on Sunday evening. “Whether such a plan could ever pass and be signed into law in that form is a very different question.”That political difficulty, along with the daunting challenge of blowing up the current system and creating something new in its place, is a big reason Clinton has not endorsed anything as ambitious as Sanders -- and has been critical of him lately.“After weeks of denying the legitimacy of the questions Hillary Clinton raised about flaws in the health care legislation he’s introduced 9 times over 20 years, he proposed a new plan two hours before the debate,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement Sunday evening. ""When you’re running for President and you’re serious about getting results for the American people, details matter -- and Senator Sanders is making them up as he goes along.”"
8,POLITICS,Donald Trump’s Remarks On Martin Luther King Day Were Mostly About Donald Trump,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-liberty-university-martin-luther-king_us_569d1e4fe4b0778f46fa2a9a,What else would you expect?,2016-01-18,Trump Announces Candidacy for 2016 Presidential Election,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56703dc71900002300789e6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"If Liberty University students were hoping for a thoughtful tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday, they didn't get it from GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Instead, after a cursory mention of King at the beginning, they got a rambling stump speech from Trump, who disparaged fellow candidates and the president, promised to go tougher on terrorists and undocumented immigrants and, most of all, talked about himself.The university occasionally hosts political candidates at its tri-weekly -- and mandatory for students -- convocations.Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. said last week that setting Trump's speech on Martin Luther King Day was intentional, because Trump planned to talk about the civil rights hero.""We chose that day so that Mr. Trump would have the opportunity to recognize and honor Dr. King on MLK day,"" Falwell said.Falwell spent his introduction speech on Monday talking up Trump, including saying the candidate lived many of the values of Jesus. The school cannot endorse candidates.The school then aired a short video on King, followed by one on Trump that was just as favorable. When the candidate took the stage, his first comment was about President Barack Obama. His second was sort of about King, but mostly about his own success in attracting a high number of attendees to the speech. About 10,000 people attended, according to reports. ""It's an honor to be here, and especially on Martin Luther King Day,"" Trump said. ""We broke the record -- we had the record for about three or four years the last time, and the first thing I said to Jerry and Becki [Falwell] when I got here, 'Did we break the record?' They said, 'Yes, you did, by quite a bit.' So we'll dedicate that to Martin Luther King, a great man. And that's a little bit of an achievement, I will tell you."" He closed with a similar remark.""We're dedicating the record to the late, great Martin Luther King, okay? But it's an honor,"" Trump said. He had some mild stumbles during the speech. He referred to the New Testament's Second Corinthians as ""Two Corinthians,"" which he called ""the whole ballgame."" CNN reports that it drew laughter from the crowd, and that some were put off by his use of the word ""hell."" Trump's praise of Christianity, like his praise of King, was made relative to himself. ""The Art of the Deal is second to the Bible,"" Trump said, referring to his own book.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), is close to tying it up in Iowa, which holds its caucus Feb. 1, and leading in New Hampshire, which holds its primary eight days later. Winning one or both of those matchups would generate momentum for Sanders heading into South Carolina, which holds the South’s first primary on Feb. 27.That’s why shoring up the Palmetto State is so crucial for Clinton. She has a huge lead in the polls, with significantly more support than her opponents among African-Americans, who constitute a majority of Democratic primary voters here. Then again, that was also the case in 2008, before President Barack Obama surged to victory.""South Carolina, you don’t need me to tell you how important you are in this election. You are the first in the South. That is a serious responsibility. And this year, you are one of our first lines of defense,"" Clinton told Democrats on Saturday at a Charleston dinner for the presidential candidates, which was packed with state party leaders and legislators. The debate Sunday is at a venue just a block away from the historic Emanuel AME Church, where nine church members were murdered last summer. Anticipating that his record on gun control would come under attack again, Sanders’ campaign announced Saturday evening that he now supports a bill that would rescind portions of a controversial law he voted for in 2005. He had previously refused to call his support for the law -- which gave gun manufacturers and dealers legal immunity from lawsuits -- a mistake. Clinton, who has suggested that Sanders has sided with the gun lobby, now has another opportunity to point out that she was for repealing the immunity law well before he was. Her campaign team immediately cast Sanders’ new position on the immunity law as a convenient pre-debate change in attitude, but his team insisted that it wasn’t a flip-flop, according to CNN. The debate is also likely to feature a confrontation between Clinton and Sanders on health care. Clinton’s campaign has initiated a multi-pronged attack in the last week on the senator’s support for a single-payer health care system. Clinton has pointed out that Sanders still hasn’t released his plan for how he’d pay for single-payer, though he promised he’d do so before the Iowa causes. She and her surrogates have argued that moving to a single-payer system would “dismantle Obamacare” and amount to an unacceptable tax increase on middle-class families. Sanders has fought back by pointing to statements Clinton has made praising the goal of universal health care in the past. These clashes on guns and on health care were foreshadowed Saturday evening. Clinton said that “we need a president who will do everything in her power to protect President Obama’s actions on gun violence and will go even further,” and said that Democrats need to defend the Affordable Care Act from attempts to repeal it or replace it. During his speech, Sanders argued that the United States shouldn’t be one of the only developed nations in the world where health care is a privilege, rather than a right. He noted that he voted for the Affordable Care Act, but that it still doesn’t mean everyone in the United States who needs coverage gets it. “We should be very proud of those accomplishments, but what we must also recognize is that despite the gains of the Affordable Care Act ... we still have a long way to go in terms of health care,” he said. Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) got their biggest applause lines when they praised Obama, in front of an audience that strongly supports the president. ""I have noticed very often that my name is linked to the president,” Clinton said. “Now I personally find that a great compliment.”The state's Democrats loved it when Clinton criticized Republicans for how they talk about Obama's supporters. “Too often we hear Republicans talking in coded racial language about ‘free stuff,’ ‘takers’ and ‘losers,’” she said to applause from a predominantly African-American room. “That has absolutely no place in our democracy and in our politics.”Sanders told the audience about his participation in the 1963 March on Washington as a University of Chicago student, calling it a “defining moment” of his life. And he spent a significant chunk of his speech describing his plans for criminal justice reform. He referred to the settlement Goldman Sachs just negotiated that allows it to resolve state and federal investigations into its handling of mortgage-backed securities in the years leading up to the financial crisis -- without admitting any liability. ""If a kid today gets caught with some marijuana, that kid will get a police record,” Sanders said. “But when the heads of one of the largest financial institutions in this country, whose greed and recklessness destroyed the lives of millions of people, they can agree to a $5 billion settlement but no police records for any of them.”Also on HuffPost:"

""I think many Americans around the country feel the same way ... If ISIS were to visit us, or our communities, at any moment, the last line of defense between ISIS and my family is the ability that I have to protect my family from them, or from a criminal, or anyone else who seeks to do us harm. Millions of Americans feel that way.""ISIS is in Syria and Iraq, and does not have the capacity to launch an assault on the United States. American counterterrorism officials have raised concerns, however, about the ability for ISIS to inspire homegrown terrorists inside the U.S. That is yet to materialize -- the San Bernardino attacks were ""inspired"" not by ISIS, but by al Qaeda and the recorded speeches of Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by an American airstrike in 2011.Many critics of U.S. gun laws have argued that the ease with which people can purchase firearms domestically enables those with terrorist motives to access weapons they need to commit violent acts.Rubio's praise for citizens arming themselves against ISIS echoes a common argument from gun enthusiasts. Easy access to guns, they argue, makes it easier for citizens to shoot mass shooters and other violent people when they begin killing people. Armed civilians almost never break up mass shootings.More than 12,900 Americans were killed by guns in 2015. Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So That Happened.""

""Saturday Night Live"" added its two cents to the discussion with their ""Republican Debate"" cold open this weekend. When asked to explain the real meaning behind his comment, Cruz (portrayed perfectly by Taran Killam) says, ""I think most people know exactly what 'New York values' are. And frankly, they are not the rest of the country's values."" He continues: ""Instead of celebrating Christmas, New Yorkers celebrate a pagan holiday called Festivus. Instead of watching American football, they challenge each other to masturbation contests. In New York, people don't say hi to their neighbors. They say, 'Helloooo, Newman.'""

Sanders has gradually expressed more of an openness to revisit the law since Clinton’s campaign began to use it as an illustration of his mixed record on gun control. Last June, Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said that the senator would make the same vote for the immunity law were it to come up again. In December, Sanders said that he was open to rethinking the law, but wouldn’t call his vote a mistake. Earlier this month, he said he’d vote to revise it. “I’m pleased that this legislation is being introduced,” Sanders said of proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to rescind portions of the immunity law. “As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up.”In a statement, Sanders also reiterated his concern that the law “should not subject the owners of small gun stores, which have not acted negligently, to lawsuits.” When pressed on gun control, Sanders frequently mentions that he comes from Vermont, a state with many hunting enthusiasts.“As I have said, I do want to make sure that this legislation does not negatively impact small gun stores in rural America that serve the hunting community,” he said. “So I’m pleased to support the legislation and should it come up for consideration I would work to make sure it includes a provision that allows us to monitor its impact so that we may determine if it is having any unintended consequences.”Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta suggested Saturday on Twitter that Sanders was flip-flopping on the issue.""The Clinton campaign welcomes Senator Sanders' debate-eve conversion, reversing his vote to immunize gun manufacturers,"" he wrote.Clinton released an ad last week that challenged Sanders to ""pick a side"" on gun control, saying that candidates either “stand with the gun lobby, or we join the president and stand up to them.”Earlier this month, she argued that the gun industry is “ the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences.” On Sunday, as she made the talk show rounds, she reiterated Podesta’s suggestion that Sanders had reversed himself on the legislation.“You know, I have pointed out repeatedly because I think it’s a critical issue that Sen.

Carson Palmer Lucks Out, Dials In.Coming off a bad interception just minutes earlier, Palmer nearly gave up possession of the ball yet again as his nine-yard pass was sent far off course by an intervening Packers defender's arm. Alas, somehow, the deflected ball made its way towards and was caught by none other than Arizona teammate Michael Floyd.2. Rodgers. Hail Mary. Part I.Desperate and treading water in the opposite end zone, Rodgers threw up a fourth-down prayer -- a prayer that went 60 yards, and sunk into the hands of Jeff Janis.3. Rodgers. Hail Mary. Part II.Never one to shy away from the big play, Rodgers refused to be deterred on this final drive of regulation, tossing an incredible 41-yard heave downfield and once more into Janis’ hands. The extra point was good, and off we went to overtime.4. Larry Was Legendary. Part I.A short pass from Palmer to Larry Fitzgerald began a 75-yard drive, as the 32-year old laced his way all the way down the field, making it nearly into the end zone before being knocked down around the five-yard line. On the night, Fitzgerald totaled 176 yards.5. Larry Was Legendary. Part II.Another short pass -- this time, a little flip -- from Palmer to Fitzgerald, sent L.F. skipping into the end zone, notching the touchdown, winning the contest, and earning the Cardinals a berth in the NFC Championship Game.This was, to say the least, an unbelievable finish to an unpredictable game. Packers fans must be devastated, but at least moving forward they know that, as long as they have Rodgers on the field, they’re never out of the contest. Meanwhile, Arizona fans -- thank your lucky stars that Mr. Fitzgerald is suiting up in Cardinals red every week.Also on HuffPost:"
16,POLITICS,The U.S. And Iran Have A Long Way To Go Before They Can Really Be Friends,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-iran-diplomatic-relations_us_569a41c7e4b0ce496424a582,America's allies in the Muslim world don't want the Iranians to sit with them.,2016-01-17,"President Barack Obama met with leaders at the Gulf Cooperation Council-U.S. summit in May 2015 at Camp David, Maryland, to discuss issues affecting the region, including terrorism and the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569aa0ff1f000050002160cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KARACHI, Pakistan -- Saturday’s news of a U.S.-Iran prisoner swap seems at first glance to suggest that the two countries may grow closer following last year's nuclear deal. The announcement of the largely unexpected exchange even overshadowed the later announcement that Iran had upheld its part of the nuclear agreement by implementing monitoring measures and extending how long it would take for it to build a nuclear weapon.But to many Muslim world leaders, the U.S. push toward closer ties with Iran is desperately flawed. And unless those countries -- such as the powerful Gulf states -- change their opinion, the U.S. can't fully embrace Iran as the strategic partner some say it should be.The Arab Sunni Muslim leaders of the closest U.S. allies in the region -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Jordan and other states -- have said for years that President Barack Obama is too keen to work with the Shiite rulers of Iran. They see Tehran as dangerous. They point to historic worries about the anti-monarchy 1979 revolution there inspiring similar rebellions among large Shiite minorities in Sunni-led states. They also note Iran's web of regional relationships, with players like Lebanon's anti-Israel Hezbollah paramilitary movement, Syria's brutal dictator Bashar Assad and Shiite figures in Iraq. In the case of Iraq, those leaders' violence helped radicalize Sunni Iraqis, who have since aided the self-described Islamic State terrorist group.(Of course, the Sunni-led states have long supported their own controversial players in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere to counter Iranian influence. They've often received American help in those efforts.)In Saturday's deal, Iran released four Iranian-Americans tried on vague charges related to Iranian state security. In exchange, the U.S. will release seven Iranians who violated sanctions. But Sunni states are likely to interpret the swap as simply one more instance of Washington trying to please Tehran. That’s hardly news, U.S.-friendly Sunni Arab elites contend.""The prevailing sentiment in Saudi Arabia is that the Obama administration has committed to making rapprochement with Iran a central element of its foreign policy legacy,"" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst at the Saudi Embassy in Washington. ""From the Saudi perspective, the U.S. is primarily relying on carrots with Iran, while Iran is using primarily sticks with the U.S. There is a perception that Iran’s decades-long intransigence and support of various militant groups across the Middle East has been rewarded by the U.S. and the West.""Iran is seen as imposing its terms on the U.S., according to Nazer, now a senior analyst at the international consultancy firm JTG, Inc.Different Sunni Arab leaders feel this way for different reasons. A few speak of Obama as so naïve that he is a tool in the hands of deceitful Iranians who want to consolidate what Jordanian King Abdullah called “a [Shiite] crescent” of Iranian surrogates. Others say the president is cynical and deliberately dishonest about the Middle East -- uninterested in tragedy, particularly if it’s linked to Iran as in the case of Assad's five-year-long massacre of his own people; desperate to shift American resources and attention elsewhere; and so enamored with the idea of effecting a foreign policy shift that he doesn’t care what long-term consequences his decisions have.Despite massive U.S. arms sales and public reassurances of continued friendship after the Iran nuclear deal last summer, Sunni policymakers in the Middle East say they have yet to see evidence that challenges the latest American policy on Iran.And Saturday's prisoner exchange isn't likely to provide the proof they want that Obama is willing to be tough on the country. Commentators have noted that the prisoners Iran is surrendering are being held under suspect circumstances, while those Washington has released were proven criminals.Rather than surprised, some observers in the region are simply amused, according to a Lebanese journalist in Beirut who asked to remain anonymous.""Iran gets away with being the arsonist and the fire brigade,"" she told The Huffington Post Saturday. ""They take people hostage and they are praised and get a price for releasing them.""(Unpopular among Obama administration officials and the Americans' families, the term ""hostages"" is one that critics abroad and at home in the U.S. are fond of.)Convinced that they must deal with what they see as the Iranian threat on their own, leaders in Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of this Sunni Arab-led group, have made their own efforts to isolate Iran. Most recently, they cut diplomatic ties over Iran's rebuke of a Shiite cleric's execution in the Sunni ruled-state, and have also built a Muslim anti-terror coalition that pointedly excludes the world's largest Shiite-led country.The recent past suggests that such action won't be guided by a concern for Washington's strategy, even as it forces Washington to act the way the Sunni Arabs would like.The Saudis launched their campaign against an Iran-linked insurgency in Yemen last year with only minimal consultation with the Obama administration. They have since been able to embroil the U.S. in the bloody war there by asserting that it is an existential struggle for Saudi Arabia's survival and tacitly portraying support in Yemen as the price of public support for the Iran deal. This year, they executed the cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, despite U.S. warnings that it might escalate Shiite-Sunni tensions across the region. While the Obama administration avoided a mini-crisis in January over the executions in Riyadh, it could not maneuver its way out of publicly backing the Saudi government and dealing with the criticism that ensued.Despite the effect that falling oil prices and foreign wars have had on their budgets, Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab countries wary of Iran can also exert strong influence in important countries like nuclear-armed Pakistan, which is ostensibly neutral on Middle Eastern rivalry. Decades of previous investment in educating hyper-conservative clerics later sent around the Muslim world and supporting actors who might help weaken Iranian influence, such as in Syria and Lebanon, have left Saudi Arabia with significant authority in the global Sunni community -- and a network of supporters who view Shiites and Iran as anathema. That won't go away, despite some observers' warnings about economic pressure now reining in Riyadh.Even as the Sunni Arab states show that they will regularly force the U.S. to pick sides between them and Iran, enforcing a divide despite U.S. efforts to maintain dialogue over issues like Syria, several of Washington's own interests will make it impossible for the outgoing Obama administration to, as some suggest, begin treating Iran as a favored or even more ""natural"" chief partner in the region. (That latter claim is often made by observers who are uncomfortable with Saudi Arabia's notorious human rights record and the state's embrace of an especially hardline version of Sunni Islam, and/or the violent tactics employed by the top U.S. Middle East ally, Israel.)Consider the following factors: U.S. military personnel are based across Sunni Arab-led states in the Middle East, most notably in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Jordan. Transferring or mimicking the capacity that's been built in those Saudi-friendly states over the years, and maintaining military relationships with American forces, would be a long, costly process.Battling radical terrorists, particularly groups like the Islamic State, will involve undercutting extremists' claims to represent Sunni Muslim interests. For instance, winning the support of Sunni tribes in Iraq and Syria -- which have strong ties to Saudi Arabia and Jordan -- is widely seen as the key factor in pushing the Islamic State out of the Sunni-dominated areas of those countries it now controls. These Sunni tribes see Iran, however, as an interfering force that backed Sunni-targeting regimes led by Assad and former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. They are unlikely to join any anti-Islamic State coalition that features Iran or similar agents like militias in Syria and Iraq.The biggest fear for Saudi Arabia and other Sunni-led states is that they will face an internal threat they cannot suppress on their own -- and that when they call for Washington's aid, they won't get it. It's why they are obsessed with the way the Arab Spring played out in Egypt -- what they view as the ultimate U.S. betrayal of a longtime partner in favor of actors speaking of democracy, more accountable government and the inclusion of anti-royal conservative groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Were the U.S. to indicate that it is pulling back from these regimes, their situation at home might shift rapidly -- with opposition becoming emboldened or governments preemptively cracking down, sowing the seeds for even more violent future uprisings.Tehran and Washington are unlikely to resolve their issues with Israel soon. The basis for Iran's claim to leadership of the Muslim world is its adoption of pan-Muslim causes that affect both Shiites, the majority in Iran but the minority worldwide, and Sunnis. No issue resonates across sect as well as sympathy for Palestine, so it will be difficult for Iran to soften its rhetoric on Israel. Even if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a fairly low standing in the U.S., it would be all too easy for his domestic allies to list the crimes that Iran-backed Hamas has committed against Israelis, and that Hezbollah has committed against Israelis and Americans -- painting deep engagement with Iran as morally dubious.The balance of power within Iran remains precarious. Important elections in February will determine just how far relative moderates can maintain their power within the theocratically run state. Meanwhile, elements of the Iranian security forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, are able to take their own steps to preserve their interests -- including signs of strength like missile tests or threatening American ships. They've also worked to preserve the business clout they've built as the now-lifted nuclear sanctions have limited their country's development.Even people in the region who worry about Iran are glad about Saturday's news of the prisoner release, the Lebanese journalist told HuffPost. But they aren't letting it change their minds about the ayatollah-led country that is now re-entering the global community.Read more on the prisoner deal here:Also on HuffPost:"

Others say the president is cynical and deliberately dishonest about the Middle East -- uninterested in tragedy, particularly if it’s linked to Iran as in the case of Assad's five-year-long massacre of his own people; desperate to shift American resources and attention elsewhere; and so enamored with the idea of effecting a foreign policy shift that he doesn’t care what long-term consequences his decisions have.Despite massive U.S. arms sales and public reassurances of continued friendship after the Iran nuclear deal last summer, Sunni policymakers in the Middle East say they have yet to see evidence that challenges the latest American policy on Iran.And Saturday's prisoner exchange isn't likely to provide the proof they want that Obama is willing to be tough on the country. Commentators have noted that the prisoners Iran is surrendering are being held under suspect circumstances, while those Washington has released were proven criminals.Rather than surprised, some observers in the region are simply amused, according to a Lebanese journalist in Beirut who asked to remain anonymous.""Iran gets away with being the arsonist and the fire brigade,"" she told The Huffington Post Saturday. ""They take people hostage and they are praised and get a price for releasing them.""(Unpopular among Obama administration officials and the Americans' families, the term ""hostages"" is one that critics abroad and at home in the U.S. are fond of.)Convinced that they must deal with what they see as the Iranian threat on their own, leaders in Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of this Sunni Arab-led group, have made their own efforts to isolate Iran. Most recently, they cut diplomatic ties over Iran's rebuke of a Shiite cleric's execution in the Sunni ruled-state, and have also built a Muslim anti-terror coalition that pointedly excludes the world's largest Shiite-led country.The recent past suggests that such action won't be guided by a concern for Washington's strategy, even as it forces Washington to act the way the Sunni Arabs would like.The Saudis launched their campaign against an Iran-linked insurgency in Yemen last year with only minimal consultation with the Obama administration. They have since been able to embroil the U.S. in the bloody war there by asserting that it is an existential struggle for Saudi Arabia's survival and tacitly portraying support in Yemen as the price of public support for the Iran deal. This year, they executed the cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, despite U.S. warnings that it might escalate Shiite-Sunni tensions across the region. While the Obama administration avoided a mini-crisis in January over the executions in Riyadh, it could not maneuver its way out of publicly backing the Saudi government and dealing with the criticism that ensued.Despite the effect that falling oil prices and foreign wars have had on their budgets, Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab countries wary of Iran can also exert strong influence in important countries like nuclear-armed Pakistan, which is ostensibly neutral on Middle Eastern rivalry. Decades of previous investment in educating hyper-conservative clerics later sent around the Muslim world and supporting actors who might help weaken Iranian influence, such as in Syria and Lebanon, have left Saudi Arabia with significant authority in the global Sunni community -- and a network of supporters who view Shiites and Iran as anathema. That won't go away, despite some observers' warnings about economic pressure now reining in Riyadh.Even as the Sunni Arab states show that they will regularly force the U.S. to pick sides between them and Iran, enforcing a divide despite U.S. efforts to maintain dialogue over issues like Syria, several of Washington's own interests will make it impossible for the outgoing Obama administration to, as some suggest, begin treating Iran as a favored or even more ""natural"" chief partner in the region. (That latter claim is often made by observers who are uncomfortable with Saudi Arabia's notorious human rights record and the state's embrace of an especially hardline version of Sunni Islam, and/or the violent tactics employed by the top U.S. Middle East ally, Israel.)Consider the following factors: U.S. military personnel are based across Sunni Arab-led states in the Middle East, most notably in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Jordan. Transferring or mimicking the capacity that's been built in those Saudi-friendly states over the years, and maintaining military relationships with American forces, would be a long, costly process.Battling radical terrorists, particularly groups like the Islamic State, will involve undercutting extremists' claims to represent Sunni Muslim interests. For instance, winning the support of Sunni tribes in Iraq and Syria -- which have strong ties to Saudi Arabia and Jordan -- is widely seen as the key factor in pushing the Islamic State out of the Sunni-dominated areas of those countries it now controls. These Sunni tribes see Iran, however, as an interfering force that backed Sunni-targeting regimes led by Assad and former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. They are unlikely to join any anti-Islamic State coalition that features Iran or similar agents like militias in Syria and Iraq.The biggest fear for Saudi Arabia and other Sunni-led states is that they will face an internal threat they cannot suppress on their own -- and that when they call for Washington's aid, they won't get it. It's why they are obsessed with the way the Arab Spring played out in Egypt -- what they view as the ultimate U.S. betrayal of a longtime partner in favor of actors speaking of democracy, more accountable government and the inclusion of anti-royal conservative groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Were the U.S. to indicate that it is pulling back from these regimes, their situation at home might shift rapidly -- with opposition becoming emboldened or governments preemptively cracking down, sowing the seeds for even more violent future uprisings.Tehran and Washington are unlikely to resolve their issues with Israel soon. The basis for Iran's claim to leadership of the Muslim world is its adoption of pan-Muslim causes that affect both Shiites, the majority in Iran but the minority worldwide, and Sunnis. No issue resonates across sect as well as sympathy for Palestine, so it will be difficult for Iran to soften its rhetoric on Israel. Even if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a fairly low standing in the U.S., it would be all too easy for his domestic allies to list the crimes that Iran-backed Hamas has committed against Israelis, and that Hezbollah has committed against Israelis and Americans -- painting deep engagement with Iran as morally dubious.The balance of power within Iran remains precarious. Important elections in February will determine just how far relative moderates can maintain their power within the theocratically run state. Meanwhile, elements of the Iranian security forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, are able to take their own steps to preserve their interests -- including signs of strength like missile tests or threatening American ships. They've also worked to preserve the business clout they've built as the now-lifted nuclear sanctions have limited their country's development.Even people in the region who worry about Iran are glad about Saturday's news of the prisoner release, the Lebanese journalist told HuffPost. But they aren't letting it change their minds about the ayatollah-led country that is now re-entering the global community.Read more on the prisoner deal here:Also on HuffPost:"

His brother Ali, pictured, had been a vocal advocate for his release.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In early December, six House Democrats traveled to New York for an under-the-radar meeting with Iran's U.N. Ambassador Gholamali Khoshroo. The topic: Four Americans being detained by Iran. Notified the night before that Khoshroo would make time to meet with the members during their United Nations visit, Rep. Jared Huffman, a Democrat of California, immediately hopped on a plane. When Huffman arrived, his House colleagues handed the platform over to him. Sitting in the room with Khoshroo -- who joined the meeting unaccompanied by any staff -- Huffman, and other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, got straight to the point: Iran needed to release Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, Christian pastor Saeed Abedini and retired FBI agent Robert Levinson. The latter has yet to be released and his whereabouts remain unknown. Huffman represents California’s 2nd congressional district, which includes Marin County -- where Rezaian and his brother Ali, who has led the push for Rezaian’s release, were born and raised. “I flew to New York specifically for that part of the [day’s] meetings,” Huffman told The Huffington Post on Sunday -- one day after the U.S. secured the release of Rezaian  and three other Americans, including Nosratollah Khosrawi-Roodsari, whose imprisonment was not reported previously. “My points were very direct,” Huffman continued. “I basically explained that even the most progressive members of Congress were not going to let go of this issue of the wrongly imprisoned Americans, and it was going to be impossible to improve relations as long as they arbitrarily rounded up and imprisoned journalists.”The tone of the roughly 30-minute meeting, which included Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.), and Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), was “positive,” according to a source in the room, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the meeting. Huffman described Khoshroo as a “quiet” and “not particularly warm or engaging” man, but he left the conversation with hope.One week prior, Huffman and Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) met with Giulio Haas, the Swiss ambassador to Iran. From those two back-to-back meetings, Huffman saw a trend emerge. Both officials were hinting at a “choreography” between the impending implementation day on which the U.S. -- in line with the nuclear deal -- would lift sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program, and when the prisoners would finally be released. “[Khoshroo] reaffirmed, to some extent for me, that while some people thought the Iranian election was the key factor in the release of the prisoners, and that we would have to wait until after that election, implementation day was a much more significant event,” Huffman said. Iran’s election isn’t until the end of February. Setting up the meeting with Khoshroo wasn’t easy; it took months, Huffman said, but gave him the chance to ask the ambassador to take his message “directly to the Supreme Leader” -- Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the final say on major decisions.According to Huffman, Khoshroo said he and Iranian “President Hassan Rouhani thought very highly of Jason and wanted to see Jason released.” The issue, Huffman said, was that there appeared to be some “internal politics at play,” specifically “division within the Iranian government, and the fact that hardliners in the Revolutionary Guard were driving the contingent imprisonment of all these innocent Americans.”Huffman said in his conversation late last year with Swiss ambassador Haaus, he came to realize how “advanced” the discussions over the prisoner exchange were, and that “significant proposals and counterproposals had been made.”As it became steadily clear everyone was moving forward, though, Huffman said, negotiators knew Rezaian would become less ""politically valuable"" to the hardliners. While the meeting focused on the Americans imprisoned by Iran, other concerns were raised by the members in attendance. Khoshroo and the members discussed the interest in Syria's civil war by their two countries. Lawmakers also drew a hard line on Israel, expressing their strong support.The six members told Khoshroo that Iran's backing of Hamas and Hezbollah, and ""recurring anti-Semitic rhetoric"" from its leaders, were ""major impediments"" to forging a better relationship. That ""behavior"" the members said ""needed to change,"" according to the source in the room.The source said Khoshroo made one brief comment that “negative rhetoric from folks on the right made diplomacy more difficult for [Iran],"" which believes a majority of Congress is filled with hardliners who oppose diplomacy. Indeed, the Republican Party, which controls the House and the Senate, unanimously opposed last year’s nuclear agreement with Iran. That’s why the progressive members wanted “direct parliamentary dialogue” of their own to send a “strong” message that they supported diplomacy efforts and improving relations with Iran from the beginning. The nature of the meeting, the source added, was ""fundamentally different"" than those between the State Department and Iranian negotiators because it was more about advocacy, and offered the perspective of members. Now, six weeks after that meeting, the freed Rezaian, Abedini and Hekmati arrived in Geneva on Sunday. The fourth freed American citizen, Khosrawi-Roodsari, was not on the flight. Describing the emotions he felt after getting news from the White House the day prior about the release, Huffman said a wave of “elation, relief -- great relief” fell over him. “There were a lot of false starts and false hopes, but something about the timing, again in light of the conversations, felt real this time,” he said. “Everything is not fixed, but certainly events like this and the successful return of our 10 sailors build the kind of normalcy and confidence that can help improve relations.”Jessica Schulberg contributed reporting.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Rep.

The Americans were freed as part of a prisoner release deal -- the result of 14 months of high-stakes secret negotiations between the U.S. and Iran.John Kerry is relieved that Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini and Nosratollah Khosrawi-Roodsari are finally free.

Afterward, they went to Zarif's hotel room and spoke again about the prisoners. “We actually shook hands, thinking we had an agreement,” Kerry said. “I thought it was done.”Kerry was deliberately vague about what happened next, but when Zarif took the proposed agreement back to Tehran, at least one Iranian government agency objected. “So we went back to work,” Kerry said.“Javad and I had agreed,” he continued, referring to Zarif. “We knew this was going to happen. We had to work out the modalities of it happening.”Zarif and Kerry continued to meet, while Brett McGurk, head of the State Department's counter-Islamic State coalition, ran a separate diplomatic track with different Iranian officials as part of the effort to keep the prisoner negotiations separate from the then-ongoing nuclear talks.The biggest obstacle was whittling down the Iranians' list of requests to something that was within “our principles and our standards,” Kerry said. “Iran asked for a lot of people.""""They fought very hard -- for a long period of time this didn’t move because of the people they were asking for,” he continued, suggesting the Iranians' original list of people they wanted the U.S. to release included people accused of murder and drug-related offenses. “Believe me, it’s hard,” Kerry said. “When somebody says to you, ‘Hey, you give us this guy, we’ll let them all out.’ And you have to say no. And you know you’re keeping people in a not very nice place for the next whatever number of months.” Ultimately, the two countries agreed on seven Iranians: three who were serving prison time and four who were awaiting trial. All seven were facing charges related to violations of nuclear sanctions -- which were lifted on Saturday. “So there was a symmetry here,” Kerry said.All seven of the Iranians released are legally allowed to stay in the U.S., and some have indicated that they do not want to return to Iran.Critics of the prisoner agreement, namely Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates, argue that any type of swap or exchange is unjust. Their logic is that Iranians in the U.S. were facing publicly announced charges and had access to an open trial, whereas the Americans held in Iran were charged, convicted and sentenced in secret -- if at all -- and appear to have been arrested for future use as bargaining chips.The deal leaves American citizen Siamak Namazi, who was arrested in October, in prison. And it doesn’t provide answers about Robert Levinson, the American CIA contractor who disappeared in 2007.Kerry sees the prisoner deal as a positive precedent for Levinson's and Namazi's cases. Iran pledged in a written agreement to maintain an open line of communication about Levinson's case and assist in the search for information about his whereabouts.Kerry credits the nuclear deal with showing that Iran and the U.S., despite having no formal diplomatic ties, can work together to resolve issues peacefully. “Were it not for that process, I do not believe this could’ve happened, nor do they,” he said, referring to the Iranians. According to Kerry, Zarif suggested that there was room for the two countries to work cooperatively on other issues, including in Yemen and Syria, where the U.S. and Iran are effectively fighting on opposite sides of proxy wars.“I put a big ‘Who knows?’” Kerry said of that suggestion. “But you have to begin somewhere.

The baby was born with microcephaly, a serious birth defect in which a baby is born with an abnormally small head and possible developmental problems.It's the first case of brain damage linked to the virus in the United States.Officials said it is likely the mother contracted the mosquito-borne illness while she was in Brazil last year during the early part of her pregnancy. Brazil saw an outbreak of Zika in 2015, with an estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million residents infected.While the virus is fairly harmless in adults -- symptoms include rash, fever, joint-pain and red eyes -- Brazil's outbreak coincided with a massive spike in microcephaly in babies. While Brazil had an average of 156 babies born each year between 2010 and 2014 with microcephaly, 2015 saw more than 3,000 instances. Although the link is not fully understood, health officials now believe the virus can have considerable effects on unborn fetuses. Hawaii State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park told The Huffington Post the mother had alerted doctors to her bout of Zika, which she recovered from before relocating to Hawaii. She was monitored closely during her pregnancy, which progressed normally. However, the baby's condition was not known until birth. The Hawaii mother and baby are not infectious according to the state's Department of Health, so there is no risk of transmission on the island. But Hawaii's Big Island is currently battling the state's largest outbreak of dengue fever, another mosquito-borne illness, in 50 years. More than 200 cases have been reported between Sept. 2015 and Dec. 2015.Dengue fever, which can violently affect adults, is transmitted by some of the same mosquitoes as Zika, though it is not thought to affect fetuses in the same way. The pattern of dengue fever in Hawaii is concerning, however, because according to The New York Times, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control ""recently predicted that Zika would follow the same pattern that dengue has, with local transmission during hot weather in tropical parts of the country, including Florida, the Gulf Coast and Hawaii."" According to Dr. Park, Hawaii's current Fight the Bite campaign aims to address all mosquito-borne illnesses, not just dengue.""They all can be combated in the same way,"" Dr. Park told HuffPost, after highlighting the need for a state-wide campaign that raises awareness and educates the public on the dangers of mosquito hot-beds like standing water. Because of the Zika outbreak in Brazil, the CDC released travel warnings on Friday concerning Central America, South America, and some islands in the Caribbean. Travelers to these areas should take special precautions against mosquito bites, including wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants and using insect repellants. Pregnant women should consider avoiding the region all together, the agency urged.The Hawaii newborn ""further emphasizes the importance of the CDC travel recommendations released today,"" Dr. Park said.There is currently no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat it.

Although the link is not fully understood, health officials now believe the virus can have considerable effects on unborn fetuses. Hawaii State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park told The Huffington Post the mother had alerted doctors to her bout of Zika, which she recovered from before relocating to Hawaii. She was monitored closely during her pregnancy, which progressed normally. However, the baby's condition was not known until birth. The Hawaii mother and baby are not infectious according to the state's Department of Health, so there is no risk of transmission on the island. But Hawaii's Big Island is currently battling the state's largest outbreak of dengue fever, another mosquito-borne illness, in 50 years. More than 200 cases have been reported between Sept. 2015 and Dec. 2015.Dengue fever, which can violently affect adults, is transmitted by some of the same mosquitoes as Zika, though it is not thought to affect fetuses in the same way. The pattern of dengue fever in Hawaii is concerning, however, because according to The New York Times, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control ""recently predicted that Zika would follow the same pattern that dengue has, with local transmission during hot weather in tropical parts of the country, including Florida, the Gulf Coast and Hawaii."" According to Dr. Park, Hawaii's current Fight the Bite campaign aims to address all mosquito-borne illnesses, not just dengue.""They all can be combated in the same way,"" Dr. Park told HuffPost, after highlighting the need for a state-wide campaign that raises awareness and educates the public on the dangers of mosquito hot-beds like standing water. Because of the Zika outbreak in Brazil, the CDC released travel warnings on Friday concerning Central America, South America, and some islands in the Caribbean. Travelers to these areas should take special precautions against mosquito bites, including wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants and using insect repellants. Pregnant women should consider avoiding the region all together, the agency urged.The Hawaii newborn ""further emphasizes the importance of the CDC travel recommendations released today,"" Dr. Park said.There is currently no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat it.
