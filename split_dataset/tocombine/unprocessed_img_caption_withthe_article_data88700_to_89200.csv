Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration Rosabeth Moss Kanter.During his lecture, inside a packed Spangler auditorium, he addressed students and stressed how important it is to have a purpose. ""The one lesson I want to convey to the young people,"" he said, ""Think about what your purpose is, what you want to stand for. Write it down. And follow it in all that you do.""In the interview, McDonald shared his lessons of West Point and CEO of Procter & Gamble and how his expertise from the private sector carries over to the public sector, to lead the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. We started with a simple question. Patrick Daniel: Where did you grew up?Bob McDonald: I was born in Gary, Indiana. Gary, Indiana is a steel town. I was born in a house that lived right across from the U.S. Steel mill and my father worked in the mill when he came back from the war. Then he went to college under the G.I. Bill. And he worked in Chicago so we lived throughout Chicago and we moved to a suburb in the Northwest of Chicago and that was where I went to West Point from.Daniel: How did that influence your life and help to become CEO of Procter & Gamble?McDonald: I think I had a great childhood. I think my parents were very loving and my parents are religious and they gave me values and I think those values have animated my life. Whether that was going to West Point where you have Duty, Honor, Country. Where joining Procter & Gamble Company which has a very strong purpose and set of values. Or agreeing to do this job when the President [Obama] called.Daniel: How did you translate your value-based leadership and private sector expertise into the public sector?McDonald: Well, I think the ten leadership beliefs that I talk about and you can find them online, they animate my behavior, my leadership behaviors, no matter whether it's a public sector or private sector. I think the principles are the same, sometimes the execution may be different, depending on the environment and the context. But that's the case when I move from P&G Toronto to P&G Japan to PNG Philippines. You have to operate in a different culture.Daniel: Could you tell us a little bit more about the ""My VA"" initiative?McDonald: Well, it's about re-organizing departments to focus on five things. And I've mentioned those in the talk. First is putting the veteran at the center of everything we do and getting good veteran experience, and good customer service. Second is improving the employee experience, because if we don't improve the employee experience, they don't take care of the veteran. Third is improving our internal support services, which frankly are not very good. Fourth is developing a culture of continuous improvement and we are training everyone in Six Sigma. And fifth is creating strategic partnerships. That will be a force multiplier for caring for veterans.Daniel: If there was one lesson that you have learned as CEO Procter & Gamble, what would that be?McDonald: One thing. God gave me two ears and one mouth, which means, I should listen twice as much as I speak. And an example of that was, I was in Japan and we were launching a new product called Febreze, which I know a lot of college students like to use for washing their cloth and two Japanese people working for me said they figured it out. I asked them to explain it to me in English and I didn't get it. I ask them to explain it to me in Japanese and I still didn't get it. And I must have gave them a million dollars or something like that to test the idea in Hokkaido, which is a Northern Island in Japan. It worked and then we expanded throughout Japan and grew the business 35 percent. Then we expanded it. I got promoted to a different role and we expand it globally, grew the business 35 percent. It taught me that I don't always have all the answers and sometimes not speaking and simply listening is the best approach.Daniel: What is the best advice you have ever received?McDonald: Choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong. The wrong thing is usually easier to do than the right thing. And you have to force yourself sometimes to do the right thing.Daniel: When you look back at your life, what was a turning point in your life?McDonald: I think going to West Point was probably a life changing experience. It amplified the values I already had. It caused me to serve the country. It taught me discipline. It changed my life. I wouldn't be doing this job today probably if I hadn't gone to West Point. It means a lot to me.Daniel: What do the first two hours of your day look like?McDonald: I get up about 4:45am and I do two hours of exercise. And I typically read while I exercise, so that's my time. Nobody can take that time from me.Daniel: Since you are avid reader, what is the book that you are most likely to give out to students?McDonald: Well, with Rosabeth Moss Kanter here, I have to say SuperCorp. It is a great book. Because it talks about the importance of value and purpose. Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Effective People is a great book. I could go on. I have a big library. Right now I'm reading a new biography of John Quincy Adams.Daniel: If you could have dinner with anyone in history, who would you choose?McDonald: That's a really relevant question because I have always said that the dinner I would like to have is with Henry Kissinger, Lee Kuan Yew and Deng Xiaoping. They were change agents and wise men. And I got to know two of them. I didn't know Deng before he passed away.Daniel: What did you learn from President Obama during your engagements with him?McDonald: I think the biggest thing I have learned from him is ""choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong."" Let me give you an example. During the Ebola crisis, there was a lot of political pressure to stop travel from Africa to the United States. And many politicians succumb to the political and said they would have done it. The President got advice from all the medical experts and the advice was don't do that because then you won't find the people, who are sick.

4,COLLEGE,Going to an Ivy Doesn't Suck: A Response to Zach Schwartz,"Theodore Caputi, ContributorDrug and Alcohol Researcher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/going-to-an-ivy-doesnt-su_b_7309992.html,"Mr. Schwartz's article made going to an Ivy seem like an empty dream - maybe even a hoax. Honestly, after two years, I wouldn't trade my time at Penn for the world. If you have the opportunity to go, I strongly recommend it.",2015-05-19,2015-05-19-1432044043-2948526-BenFranklinPennStatute.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-19-1432044043-2948526-BenFranklinPennStatute-thumb.jpg,"I just read a viral article from VICE entitled: ""Going to an Ivy League School Sucks."" As a student at Penn, Philadelphia's Ivy League school, I was curious.Mr. Schwartz makes some good points. There is certainly a lot of pressure to do well at college, and being at an Ivy probably magnifies that pressure. However, Mr. Schwartz paints the Ivy League with a broad brush, and I want to add some balance to the conversation.My initial reaction to the article is that Mr. Schwartz may have simply chosen a school that's not a good fit for him. He decries the tendency for students to throw aside their passion to major in financial economics. He claims that financial firms cherry pick prestige-hungry Ivy Leaguers. Schwartz attends Columbia, which is smack dab in the middle of the world's largest financial center. I am not a Columbia student, and so I can't speak to the school's culture - but I can guess that Columbia students may be drawn to finance simply because of their proximity to the world's financial powerhouses. When you live just a few miles away from some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people, it is only natural to want to follow in their footsteps. The pressure Mr. Schwartz is feeling may be more indicative of his location than of the Ivy League as a whole. There are eight Ivies, and each one is different.Still, there is no denying that a lot of Ivy Leaguers major in finance or financial economics. I am a finance concentrator at Wharton - Penn's business school and a well-known feeder to Wall Street - but I hardly feel that I was pushed or pressured into finance. More so than anything else, I've found that students at Penn have big dreams. They want to be doctors, lawyers, artists, community leaders, business titans, or politicians. The reason many of these students pursue finance and financial economics is because they know the core skills of finance - quantitative analysis and judging value - are essential to success in virtually any field. At a school like Penn, I did not drop my passions to pick up a briefcase. Through a mixture of phenomenal teachers, extracurricular engagement, and close mentors, I have learned that finance is a valuable (and interesting) skill that can help me pursue my interests. This manifests itself in the prevalence of double-majoring - I know students in my major who are complementing their studies in finance with courses in entrepreneurship, social impact, music, anthropology, the fine arts, and the hard sciences. They know a finance background is a necessary part of succeeding in their field, whatever field that may be.Mr. Schwartz also discusses the competitive pressures and stress that Ivy League students often face. Is Penn a competitive place? Absolutely. Penn students are passionate, and wherever there is passion, there will be late nights and competition. But Penn is also wonderfully collaborative and supportive. Ivies are flush with resources and people to help you. In recent years, Penn has become a leader at fostering supportive environments for students, creating and maintaining thriving cultural and peer support groups. Many in-class assignments are done in teams, and your success is contingent upon the success of your peers. What I find most objectionable about Mr. Schwartz's article is not what he wrote - it's what he neglected to mention. I can't speak for all the Ivies, but Penn has afforded me some of the most valuable and exciting experiences I could imagine. Even in my first semester, Wharton challenged me to work on a team and essentially become a management consultant for a local non-profit. I have taken courses from industry experts - the scholars who wrote the seminal texts are often lecturing in my class. Some of the world's most recognized and authoritative professors have given me hours of advice and mentorship. This past semester, one of my professors went straight from talking to me about graduate schools to delivering commentary on CNN. I even got the chance to perform research with a world-renowned substance abuse researcher and policy maker - we co-authored a paper, which we are currently submitting to academic journals. At Penn, I have access to the world's thought leaders.In two years at Penn, I have had the opportunity to interview a renowned Carnatic (South Indian) musician in an ethnomusicology course, engage in participant observation in an anthropology course, and make a tangible contribution to the community in an environmental health course. Each class was taught by either a leading or up-and-coming scholar in his or her respective field. Where else could a ""finance major"" get that kind of exposure to the liberal arts?Beyond the classroom, the extracurricular opportunities are unparalleled. There are literally hundreds of clubs on Penn's campus, and each have the resources to contribute to Penn's vibrant culture. Whether you are interested in a particular vocation, community service, an art, a social cause, a sport - or heck, ping pong - there's a club and a community for you at Penn. Ivies have the resources to guarantee these groups can not only exist, but thrive.Finally and most importantly, the opportunities for personal growth at a place like Penn are simply outstanding. Want to go hiking in Patagonia? Want thousands of dollars to start a company? Want to learn about new cultures or fields of study? Want to pursue undergraduate research, and get paid for it to boot? You can do it all at a place like Penn. Not to mention, Ivies foster powerful alumni networks, which give undergraduates access to some of the best mentors in the world.Mr. Schwartz's article made going to an Ivy seem like an empty dream - maybe even a hoax. Honestly, after two years, I wouldn't trade my time at Penn for the world. If you have the opportunity to go, I strongly recommend it. Going to an Ivy (or any college) involves a lot of sleepless nights writing papers and preparing for exams. There's no denying that. But the Ivy League is also a fabulous place to grow, learn, and develop meaningful relationships. If you're still worried, come to Penn - I guarantee it doesn't ""suck"" here."

Every death requires me to revise my mental checklist. I'm running out of options.",2015-05-19,2015-05-12-1431400614-3301069-Time_cover_Baltimore_riots.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-12-1431400614-3301069-Time_cover_Baltimore_riots-thumb.jpg,"For two weeks, following the death of one very well known African-American, a dark cloud was hung over Baltimore, Maryland, a populous and racially divided city in the Mid-Atlantic. Looting and burning of various buildings in the communities of the minorities that occupied them was rampant. Soon enough, National Guardsmen in riot gear were called to quell crowds and hush the uproar, forcefully. The year? 1968. The death? Martin Luther King Jr.The year is now 2015 and the city of Baltimore faces another uphill battle. Sadly, it's nothing new.---Dear Baltimore,It's been a couple of weeks of unrest. Authorities choosing not to rest to apparently protect the well-being of the city. Those coping with yet another killing of an innocent civilian choosing not to rest due to lack of closure because those same authorities are hypocritical about protecting the well-being of the city.Maybe all it took was a rational decision by the police to avoid this all. There's the hypocrisy. The well-being of the city wouldn't be in question had the police humanely arrested Freddie Gray due to being a person of interest to officers.People are sick and tired of being sick and tired, can't you agree? Sadly that famous quote is still synonymous to today's America.I want to speak out to the citizens and the authorities of this city.To hear the news of Gray's slaying was heartbreaking. I know it is hard to fathom why history keeps repeating itself in such a negative and mostly fatal fashion. The police have gone into full open season mode on whomever they see fit to bite the next bullet of brutality. Often times, their records stay clean as those affected are left to clean up the mess they left behind. That too ends up in tragedy. We often end up with a skewed view of the real problem that has not only had a profound affect on your city, but on many cities across the country. In response, rioting and looting became the cry for help and for answers.Didn't it seem like the only way to garner attention? There has been countless occurrences of police brutality to fatality that has fallen by the wayside, which is even more tragic.I do not condone rioting nor looting but while tearing down the city is often labeled as ""not the answer"", what is the answer? What will stop families from hurting? What will stop mothers and fathers from burying their sons and daughters and vice versa because of police brutality? What are our solutions; our options to helping to solve the problems the police are causing? Furthermore, how has most of the police force turned into modern-day Nicky ""Mr. Untouchable"" Barnes'?Baltimore it's time for serous accountability and transparency. It's time for change.I fear for my brothers, sisters and even myself. Police are slaying folks regardless of name but likely on skin color.Whenever I learn the tragic stories of people such as Freddie, I ask myself ""what do I do if I were to get stopped or tailed randomly by a policeman who sees me as a person of interest?""Every death requires me to revise my mental checklist. I'm running out of options.So how many deaths will it take until those in charge to get to the center of the issue at hand? Seriously. This may never know.To the family of Freddie Gray and the city of Baltimore, I pray with you. You are loved, cared for and your actions have sent shockwaves through this country.I wish for a better America with you."

Living on opposite coasts, we got to know each other via Facebook, emails, Skype, and phone calls and discovered both of us missed the memo that people begin to wither on the vine at 50. We believe it's quite the opposite. With kids in various stages of launching (I have two teenagers while Jack's oldest is graduating from Cal Berkeley this week, and his younger son is a freshman in college) -- along with a healthy dose of wisdom acquired after years of unpacking our baggage -- middle age, we realized in our chats, actually unlocks a psychological and sexual renaissance. So we decided to share with you our revelation -- that the new Sexual Revolution begins at 50. Here's why:#1 ""Been there, done that, and that's why we should try anything and everything, now, on our sexual bucket list.""Jack: ""If not now, when?"" That's the perennial question many couples ask themselves as they enter their fifth decade of life. This becomes an even truer statement after going through the extreme emotional roller coaster ride of a separation and divorce. After that world of crazy, how scary can experimental be? Exactly. Let it ride. Erica: Do you really want to reach the end of your life regretting that you didn't take that trip to the dungeon, or whatever else your groin desired? As long it's safe, fun, and yes, sometimes crazy -- and of course consensual -- then, seize the day.#2 ""I'm hornier now than I've ever been in my life.""Jack: Most guys, whom I know anyway, claim they aren't slowing down, a bit, in the bedroom. If anything, they want more. And if they can't get it up, despite their inner desire drive, there's plenty of Viagra to pass around to all those in need. A survey conducted by BJU International, as reported in Science Daily, found that men in their 50s are more satisfied in their sex lives than men in their 30s and 40s. Asked to rate their sex satisfaction on a scale of 0-4, men in their 50s rated their sexual satisfaction at 2.77, versus fellas in their 30s at 2.55 and those in their forties at 2.72. Erica: Contrary to conventional misguided wisdom, not all menopausal women have permanently misplaced their libidos. A 2012 study in The American Journal of Medicine found that sexual satisfaction actually increased as women aged, with those over 80 being as orgasmic as their younger counterparts. #3 ""I'm NOT tired.""Jack: Most folks in their 50s have settled into their careers, and a fortunate few have stepped off the career platform thanks to early retirement. Their kids are grown, so the late night feedings, earaches, and projectile vomiting are ancient memories. There's a lot more time then, to explore, on a sexual anthropological level, the ultimate quest of ""the birds and the bees.""Erica: The last thing I wanted when I had a child latched on to my breast was my husband reaching for the other one. Now, post-divorce and with my job as personal assistant to my children nearing its end, I have more time to think about sex, more energy to act on it, and more opportunities to discover what turns me on.  #4 ""I don't have Tommy this weekend; he's in college.""  Jack: Tommy isn't home, at all, on any given night of the week, other than Christmas or summer vacation. That leaves every room in the house open for a new and exciting nightly adventure with your partner. Let the games begin!Erica: Now that you don't have to worry about Tommy walking in on you, you're free to explore your sexuality as often and as vocally as you'd like. #5 ""I'd love to be your librarian, school girl, mermaid, stripper tonight.""Jack: Role-play never gets old. She could be Cleopatra. She could be a cop. She could be a spy. She could be a dominatrix. She could be Wonder Woman. She could be Cat Woman. She could be a teacher. And that's just in the first seven days. Erica: Add some spanking, blindfolds, and bondage to the mix and you've got the makings of a hot Master-Sub scene. By 50, a man has learned the difference between dominating a woman in bed and trying to control her life. And he's mastered the former.#6 ""I don't get much sleep, for a damn good reason.""Jack: As folks get older, it gets harder and harder for them to fall asleep. So what do they do? Some read; others watch TV. And then there are those special ones who can't sleep for a damn good reason, and there is nothing unhealthy about that as they howl at the moon. Erica: When men are young, they want to get a woman off to make themselves feel good. But once they've reached midlife, they want to make their partners feel good. And what better way to fall asleep than after an earth-moving orgasm?#7 ""I can't get pregnant.""Jack: If you've had kids already, the greatest thing of all about being with a woman, post menopause, is she can't get pregnant. Period. Oh, yeah, that's gone too. So there is no down time. That means, all things being equal, every night is a go night for a couple at this age. How hot is that? Erica: Once women stop worrying about getting pregnant -- or not getting pregnant -- they start enjoying sex purely for the sake of sex, often for the first time.#8 ""He really knows his way around downtown.""Jack: As a man ages, he turns his focus from being all about him to being all about her. There's nothing that gives him greater pleasure than to please her first, and that comes with his mad skills navigating downtown. Erica: He's not the only one who knows his way down below. By the time a woman turns 50, she's had decades to turn giving head into an art form. #9 ""Toys and Piercings.""Jack: It's easier than ever for couples to get their hands on toys, thanks to the power of the Internet and a valid credit card. The sky's the limit when it comes to electrical sexual adventures. Turn it up! Erica: Why stop at toys? Why not try some body ornamentation? Besides looking sexy, some piercings actually enhance sexual pleasure for you and your partner. And you're never too old for that.#10 ""Leave the bathroom door unlocked, and I'll knock three times.""Jack: The unisex bathroom is back at fancy restaurants, which is incredibly exciting for couples in their 50s who want to sneak a lil sumthin' sumthin' before dessert. Just make sure that you knock on the right door, with the agreed-upon knock sequence, before entering to make sure that you're partner is inside. And make sure, when you're finished, that you both wash your hands thoroughly at the communal sink so you can look at each other's Cheshire grins. Erica: Or maybe we should just leave the door unlocked. I love the idea of getting caught.Photos of Erica Jagger by Nick Holmes.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

She has served as the company's Artistic Director since January 2013 and as its Artistic Advisor since June 2011. She has directed 15 productions for the company, starting with Of Mice and Men in 2001. Her most recent production was Dialogues of the Carmelites this past February. ""Francesca Zambello continues to bring passion and vision to WNO, and I am thrilled she will be staying in the Kennedy Center family,"" says Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter. ""Her deep commitment to WNO's mission, its legacy of rich artistic programming, and its outreach and education initiatives will continue to bring WNO to a new level of artistic excellence."" I have interviewed Ms. Zambello several times for Huffington Post, and feel she has brought much to Washington National Opera in terms of creative staging, the hiring of excellent singers (e.g. Isabel Leonard, Dolora Zajick, Deborah Voigt, Angela Meade, Joshua Hopkins, Stephen Costello, Andrea Carroll and Patricia Racette -- to name a few), and the commissioning of new American opera through the American Opera Initiative. Her productions of Florencia in the Amazon (2014), The Lion, The Unicorn and Me (2013, world premiere), Show Boat, (2013), and The Force of Destiny (2013) fascinated me with their complexities. Next season she will direct the company's first-ever complete Ring cycle. The last time I saw Ms. Zambello was on May 9, the opening night of Cinderella. She was in the lobby of the Kennedy Center passing out flyers for the 2015-16 season. I decided she was the very model of the modern artistic director: hands on, and able to connect with her audience. Soon Ms. Zambello will return to Cooperstown for the 40th anniversary season of the Glimmerglass Festival, where she has been General and Artistic Director since 2010. This summer Glimmerglass will stage The Magic Flute, Vivaldi's Cato in Utica, Macbeth and Bernstein's Candide, which Ms. Zambello will direct.Other future directing projects for Ms. Zambello include the world premiere of La ciociara (Two Women) at San Francisco Opera and a revival of Luisa Miller to open San Francisco Opera's 2015-2016 season. Personally, I look forward to many more evenings at Washington National Opera blessed by Ms. Zambello's innovative touch.(Portrait of Francesca Zambello by Stephen Voss.)"

Toss your processed, packaged foods that are filled with refined sugar, refined salt, additives, chemicals and other pro-inflammatory ingredients and load your fridge with fresh produce this summer. Many people use veggies to grill and toss into salads or side dishes, which is wonderful for summer entertaining but why not get a little creative and toss some fresh fruit into your salads, main dishes and side dishes? You might be surprised but it's easy to add fresh mango and fresh berries to a quinoa salad with pecans and fresh basil; or try fresh mango salsa with guacamole served with whole grain gluten-free tortilla chips. You can even add mango to other recipes such as chicken dishes, black bean dips or chickpea salads as well as cold pasta dishes, tacos and fajitas. Introduce new flavors to your family and friends by getting creative (and kicking up your taste buds) by substituting mango in recipes that call for strawberries and tomatoes! As much as I love my veggies, it's so important to get the antioxidants, fiber and nutrients from fresh fruits, as well. Plus, fresh fruits add incredible flavor to everything from oatmeal to smoothies and are so versatile that you can toss them in a bowl with leftovers to make a Buddha bowl salad for lunch the next day! So, the next time you're in the food store and you're stumped on what to buy for the week ahead, grab a few mangos along with some other fresh fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, lean proteins and whole grains to set yourself up for a weeks-worth of healthy food and nourishing ingredients. The best part? When you find yourself craving something sweet and you don't want to dig into a pint of ice cream or a box of cookies, all you need to do is whip out your fresh mango, dice it up and enjoy it with finely chopped fresh mint and a drizzle of honey. That will surely cure your sweet tooth; it's a sweet treat that surely won't weigh you down! The bright flavor and natural sweetness makes it a healthy (and tropical) stand-alone dessert or afternoon snack.Since I was a young girl, my family considered mangos a nutritional powerhouse; they're full of vitamin C, vitamin A and lots of fiber, plus they contain over 20 minerals and vitamins, so you can feel good about serving them in everything from pureed mango salad dressing to mango ice pops. My mother served us mango in the summertime and it was a special treat for my sister and I. When you're shopping for mangos, don't judge the mangos in the food store (or farmers markets) by their color; red doesn't mean ripe. You'll need to squeeze the fruit (gently, of course) to make sure it's tender and ripe. If it's ripe, that means it's ready to be used in a recipe! If it's still a bit hard, leave it on the store shelf and reach in for another one that's more tender and ready for use.  Here are a few mango recipes you can dig into just in time for Memorial Day weekend:â¢ Grilled Mango & Shrimp Skewers â¢ Almond Mango Smoothie â¢ Shrimp & Mango Lettuce Cups â¢ Mango Berry Pops â¢ Mango Salsamole â¢ Grilled Mango with Crema, Cilantro & Pumpkin Seeds"

In February, President Obama designated three new national monuments in Illinois, Colorado and Hawaii and urged Americans to ""find their national park"" and go there. He even had the gall to declare one of the weeks in April National Park Week. Of course, national parks or public lands in general are not mentioned in the Constitution. National parks weren't invented until 1872, when Congress, in a rare and rash legislative action, set aside Yellowstone National Park as a perpetual pleasuring ground for Americans then and forever. Looking back it's something of a miracle that America in the Gilded Age could have done anything so altruistic as establish a national park without thought of economic benefit, if not outright dollars. As one French traveler and observer noted in the middle 1800's, no one ever overheard two Americans in a conversation without the word 'dollar' being used somewhere. When I became a park ranger in 1972, we were still telling the story of how a U.S. government survey party scouting the Yellowstone in 1871--sat around a campfire near the end of their journey and waxing romantic in the flickering light--hit on the idea that maybe this place should be set aside, taken out of federal land programs devoted to settlement and development and preserved as it was for all time...or at least as long as possible. The story is apocryphal and historians have since written more accurately about the birth and growth of our national parks. And wouldn't you know it, money and dollars were in the conversation from the beginning. Involved nearly from the beginning were the railroads. A financial juggernaut, they were never known for their bleeding heart sympathies for nature, wildlife, and scenic vistas...unless there was money to be made. And national parks promised to generate a lot of money from people interested in seeing the American West, and willing to pay for it. Railroads would get them there. Most of the great national parks had their champion. John Muir for Yosemite, Enos Mills for Rocky Mountain, Marjorie Stoneman Douglass for Everglades and many now forgotten Americans pushed to establish parks across the country. But for every one of those altruistic Americans there were others who tried to turn a profit from parks even before they became a park. Kendell Vanhook Bumpass, in 1865 for example, recognized the great potential to make a buck from the bubbling mud pots and boiling springs in today's Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California. Leading one group of prospective tourists and investors into a particularly active thermal area Bumpass broke through the crust and plunged his leg into a boiling pool of water scalding himself badly. That ended his efforts to make a profit from one of America's geologic wonders, but his name lives on for the thousands of hikers each year who make the easy trek to Bumpass Hell. The fact that Americans saw profit potential from national parks even from the beginning should be no surprise, given our enterprising and entrepreneurial spirit. It can be argued that the national parks would not have survived at all if they were not financially valuable, a national asset. In fact, the National Park Service has tracked and analyzed the economic value of America's national parks for years now. The recent 2015 report on 2014 park visitation and economic impacts has just been made available and although it's much like the 2014 report for 2013, the economic impacts are stronger. What it shows through the best analytics available, is that America's national parks make a substantial economic contribution to the gateway communities that lie within a 60 mile radius of the park. Through multiplier effects, the economic benefits ripple through regions eventually making significant contributions to the nation's overall gross national product (GNP). Wealth is generated from people spending money in and near our national parks. People coming from across the country and from all over the world. People demanding food, shelter, rubber tomahawks, T-Shirts and coffee mugs. People spending money and creating jobs, stimulating manufacture of all those souvenirs, driving eco and not so eco-tourism industries, and all the while providing the added bonus of learning something about our planet and ourselves, and seeing something truly inspiring. According to the National Park Service, upwards of 277,000 direct jobs are created from people visiting national parks. Visitors spend about $15.7 billion though activities such as; eating in restaurants, staying in motels, camping, buying gas, paying sales taxes, demanding stylish hooded sweatshirts. And all of that spending ripples through the American economy creating wealth from magnificent landscapes, inspiring and somber battlefields and legacy monuments to great individuals who made their mark on the fabric of the American experience. Not too bad for a renewable resource. Now compare the national parks as a resource against other more traditional resources like oil, and natural gas. Those resources produce wealth too, but the communities that depend on them will know much greater swings. Every oil town has seen at least one boom and bust cycle, and usually more than one. Tourism around national parks can experience ups and downs as well, but hardly the same extreme as the oil field. And tourism dollars are buffered against recession by foreign visitation. Unless it's an ill wind indeed some part of the globe is growing in wealth, and many of the citizens from those countries will spend significant money to see America. I bring all this up because recently the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Colorado issued plans for oil and gas leasing on lands it manages. Colorado BLM land borders Dinosaur National Monument, Mesa Verde National Park, and Chaco Culture National Historical Park. These parks generate significant wealth for their communities and those earnings ripple through the economy making America a wealthier country. Park Rangers for Our Lands has been asking the National Park Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to work together to better develop the kind of landscape planning along the borders of these parks where oil and gas development could damage the very value that makes these parks so special. We have been arguing that there is room for both oil and gas leasing on BLM lands, when it is done through planning, that recognizes the value and sensitive resource issues near the boundaries of national parks. That doesn't seem a stretch to us. Near Dinosaur National Monument the Bureau of Land Management has done a reasonably good job of developing a plan that promises to protect recreation opportunities, clean air, wildlife habitat, and scenic vistas important to the park, while allowing oil and gas development where it would not impact the park. That is not the case at Mesa Verde where Colorado BLM had adopted a plan that would allow oil and gas leasing in areas adjacent to Mesa Verde that would degrade air quality, cloud the night sky, squeeze wildlife habitat and weaken recreational values of this park. This is unnecessary and there is room for both parks and oil and gas, and it appears that Colorado BLM might be coming around. Local field staff announced that they would take a ""fresh look"" by pursuing a master leasing plan that could strike a better balance between energy development and the future of the park. Eventually we will run out of fossil fuel and we'll be operating on solar, wind, wave, and maybe fusion power. Who knows? But there will be an end to oil and gas...and coal. But it isn't the same for our nation's national parks, unless we fail to plan wisely. As we used to say about Stephen Mather, the first Director of the National Park Service, there will never be an end to the good he has done. There should never be an end to the national parks either and there doesn't have to be. Planning on a landscape level that considers all of the values in play can provide for the extraction of important oil and gas resources and protect the values and continue to keep our national parks the valuable and inspiring landscapes that they are.  Throughout my career as a park ranger we would joke that we got paid less with money and more in sunsets, and in our national parks the sunsets can be priceless."

Sounds good, right?I got to discover even greater layers of calm, peace, caring for my body, mind and spirit than ever before. I got to learn even healthier ways to deal with stress. It truly is such a gift. I am so grateful to say that I've made some big life-style shifts that have dramatically helped my recovery and will help many clients and students live happier lives, with less stress and more flow in the future. It has been an invitation into deeper lessons on love and care.So we can ask ourselves, if we are in challenging situations, health or otherwise:1. ""What can I learn from this?""2. ""What is the blessing in this?""3. What are the lessons in this?""4. ""What might I share from this? How can my experience benefit others?""These questions are helpful in almost all situations as we move into deeper responsibility and co-creation of our lives. Try it and let me know how it goes! Be well, Susanna Barkataki www.healthyhotgoddess.com"

19,COMEDY,"Can We Say So Long, but Not Goodbye, to Dave?","Jamie Masada, ContributorFounder & CEO, Laugh Factory",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-we-say-solong-but-not_b_7309124.html,"If I headed any network, I would never let a comedy treasure like him retire.  David is still at the top of his game and has so much more to give.  If he doesn't want to work nightly anymore, perhaps one of the networks can get him to do a few specials each year.",2015-05-19,2015-05-18-1431992060-4153180-DavidLetterman_Huffington.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-18-1431992060-4153180-DavidLetterman_Huffington-thumb.jpg,"While the show business community and the audience for David Letterman are in the process of saying thanks and goodbye, I've had a recurring thought: why must we say goodbye? Many of us are going to have a difficult withdrawal from our dose of Dave, especially the comedy community, and I'm just hoping his absence from our lives is a brief one.I first met David Letterman back in 1977 when the late comedian George Miller introduced me to him. I was just a kid and a newcomer and I was starting to work as a comedian. One day Robin Williams invited me to open for him and David Letterman at the Bla Bla Cafe on Ventura Blvd. During my set the audience was so quiet I thought they were all deaf and needed sign language, until I finally got a good laugh on this joke: ""I was at a dance club and I asked one of the girls to dance with me. She was, as they say in my country, extremely well fed. While slow dancing, she came in real close to me and whispered in my ear, 'what do you use in your country for protection?' I said, 'a knife or a stick.'"" I was so pleased to get any response that I said, ""That's my closer, good night"" and bolted from the stage. Later that night during Robin's set, he was feeling badly for me and brought me back onto the stage and started teaching me Shakespeare. That got a lot of laughs, the audience really enjoy it.After the show, David gave me suggestions on how to fix some of my jokes. One joke he fixed, wound up getting laughs whenever I performed it afterwards. The way I told the joke was, ""Everybody always gave me advice on how to pick up girls in America by spending a lot of money on them. So I met a girl and I said, 'I would like to buy you a piano.'"" David said I would get more laughs if I added a response from the girl. He said that she should reply ""I would rather have an organ."" I did that joke Dave's way, and always got lots of laughs. David was like that with everybody. He was very creative and giving, always offering other comedians help.  In 1979 when the comedians went on strike because we weren't getting paid, David was already making money, but made it a point to help out. I remember one night we were on the picket line and David and Tom Dreesen showed up; I found out later that David guest hosted that night for Johnny Carson, but he showed up to help his fellow comics further their cause.  If it wasn't for comics like David Letterman, Tom Dreesen, George Miller, Jay Leno - and many others - the comedians today would not be getting paid at the established clubs. I always remind the comedians that those individuals were the pioneers, who struck to get them their due. For those interested in that history, I recommend the excellent book written by Los Angeles Times editor Bill Knoedelseder, called I'm Dying up Here.  David never stopped helping comedians. Like his mentor Carson, Dave helped expose and promote stand-up comics on his show. In fact, he exposed more comedians on his TV show than any subsequent late night host. He never forgot his roots, and he never forgot those who performed with him on his rise. Tom Dreesen, Jeff Altman, Johnny Dark, Paul Mooney, George Wallace, Jimmie Walker, John Witherspoon, and so many others, were all on The Late Show many times, because Dave knew it was an important way to get them known.David truly is a person filled with care and compassion. When David found out about George Miller's diagnosis with leukemia, he arranged to secure a two bedroom apartment with a 24 hour nurse for him. David paid for everything. After a few years, Miller's health deteriorated and near the end, Dave - even with his busy schedule - managed to fly in from New York to spend a few hours with his comic buddy. I joined Dave and Tom Dreesen and Gary Mule Deer at George's apartment and watched Dave give him encouragement and positive reinforcement. A few months later, George died from a blood clot in his head and I had to pass on that tragic news to everybody including David. He was devastated.David is a rare person, extremely funny, and extremely generous with a big heart. Not only does he help comedians, his charity work is unmatched and practically unknown. He has a foundation for underprivileged kids and nobody knows about it. I only found out about it from one of my Comedy Camp kids.   If I headed any network, I would never let a comedy treasure like him retire. David is still at the top of his game and has so much more to give. If he doesn't want to work nightly anymore, perhaps one of the networks can get him to do a few specials each year. He is a national treasure and a ""doctor of the soul"" whose sense of fun has cured many of us from our doldrums. I've never seen all of the Laugh Factory comedians in agreement on any one thing, but they all seem to agree on David's importance and contributions to comedy. It seems that these feelings are also shared by comics all around the country.So my mantra is--so long Dave, enjoy the break, but we ain't saying goodbye."

Even as it racked up Emmys and accolades, I wouldn't watch.I'd lived through Happy Days and other treacly tributes to the '50s and '60s that didn't ring anything like true. They'd glossed over or just plain avoided the ugly stuff I'd lived through as a black girl growing up in that very white world.I was about to graduate from high school right about the time the fictional Mad Men world ended -- only a little older than Sally Draper. So I was there when they first unleashed that now much-debated Coke commercial that brought the finale to such a mischievous end. I sang right along, back then. With a snarky smirk.But it made me smile, that last night -- what a wonderful ""wink"" that was. Even though Don Draper was still, to the bitter end, ""The Man"" we used to rail against in those days. A cynical suit, biting off bits of our counter culture and selling it back to us with clever jingles that stuck in our heads no matter how hard we fought.Everything we did wound up packaged up neat and sold for 'way more than we could afford. Even the Salvation Army clothes we bought and tarted up became so fashionable that they were sold out in all our favorite second hand stores. Worn by debutantes at flashy discotheques. Clothes, music, neighborhoods -- everything we touched was eventually ""gentrified.""So... given that, why was that finale such a heart-wrenching experience for me? And millions of others who actually lived through that era?Mad Men's genius lay in the way it deftly avoided the clichÃ©s the others clung to. In fact, it defied formulas, period, as great literature always does. The only thing you knew for sure was that a curve ball was coming. And you might not be able to duck in time.Yes, the wardrobe and sets were picture perfect and Don Draper was the quintessential company man -- as that finale ending made even clearer. There he was, still in his white shirt, smiling and ""om-ing"" in lotus as he dreamt of the Coke ad he would write as soon as he found a way off that beach and back to his desk.But in the polarized world Mad Men depicts -- and the tumult of the '60s was every bit or even more contentious than our current culture wars -- we stubbornly and steadfastly refused to budge an inch away from our various party lines. And so we never got a good look at each other. Or allowed ourselves to really ""see"" each other.We weren't just divided by race. White folks were mad at each other, too, I was shocked to learn, when my parents moved us into a predominantly white 'hood for high school. My hippie friends hated straights, though we waxed poetic about ""peace and love."" Their mostly arrow-straight parents hated hippies, with reason, I fear, after fighting their way up those career and social ladders only to be ridiculed by their own children.Too many of us forgot that those soldiers didn't cause or ask to go to Vietnam. Mad Men dealt with this brilliantly a few episodes before the last, when Glen Bishop, angered by Sally's knee jerk reaction to his enlistment, hotly retorted, ""What about a bunch of Negro kids dying while we just sit at home getting stoned?""A few of my own high school friends signed up for exactly that reason. But I was more like Sally at the time -- most my friends were. We could not have taken to the streets or sat in on campus if we'd let ourselves think too deeply, I suppose.So it just wasn't cool to think that maybe those Grace Kelly blonds on Michigan Avenue cried inside and alone at night while their blue-suited husbands worked 'way too hard and drank 'way too much trying to sedate the wild child crying inside them, too.That wasn't pain. I was black/female/a teenage kid. I knew what real pain was. In fact, my white friends all walked out of classes after MLK's assassination in ""solidarity"" with me and my pain. But we were all in pain. And in the midst of a maelstrom the likes of which our young country had never seen before. Parents watched in horror as the children who had turned on them were shot dead in the streets when men they paid to ""serve and protect"" turned on their children instead. JFK died. Malcolm X died, MLK died, civil rights workers died, three little black girls died, Bobby Kennedy died, thousands of soldiers and civilians died--the complacency and odd, blind ""innocence"" of the 50s died, violently, before our eyes on TV. Who could think?Mad Men made me think. Over and over and over again, it forced me to think. And feel. And laugh at myself and burn with rage, too, sometimes. And wonder why we're still making the same damned mistakes today. After all this time and turmoil.The finale was a strand of perfect Mad Men pearls, one after the other. I gasped, I laughed, I feared it was just about to miss the mark... and then it hit that bullseye smack dab in the middle.One for the ages -- finale and series, both. The real thing, as the Coke ads used to say. And good to the last drop, to quote yet another ad from yesteryear. Serving up moments I could feel. And will remember as fondly, and with just as much confusion and affection, as I remember the era itself.Mad Men, in a mad world, deftly resurrected. And now to be, forever, so sadly missed.Photo credit: Luiz Fernando Reis, Free Cultural Works license, attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)"

Maxine Waters (D-CA) listens during a discussion June 28, 2013 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Rep. Waters held the discussion on 'A Way Forward For Housing Finance Reform: Finding Sustainable Solutions to Ensure Access, Affordability, and Taxpayer Protection Part II.' (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f9d0200000c70101dd1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Defrauded student loan borrowers seeking relief from the Obama administration are confronting an Education Department process that a senior House Democrat compared to the governmentâs bungled response to the mortgage robo-signing crisis that shook the U.S. housing market.In the case of robo-signed mortgage documents, bank regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve in 2011 created a time-consuming process to evaluate each borrowerâs claim. Banks spent more than $2 billion to process the claims without a single dollar going to aggrieved borrowers before regulators aborted the plan in 2013 in favor of cash payouts and mortgage assistance.To Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, the Education Departmentâs likely approach to student loan borrowers who have been defrauded seems doomed to repeat the mistakes. Like in the robo-signing case, borrowers stand to lose.Federal law and U.S. Department of Education rules give borrowers the right to have their federal student loans canceled if they were defrauded by their schools into taking out the debt. The so-called defense against repayment provision is buried in borrowersâ loan contracts with the federal government.The Education Department faces more than 1,000 such claims from former students of Corinthian Colleges Inc., the bankrupt for-profit chain that once ranked among the nationâs largest with more than 120 colleges and more than 110,000 students.Federal and state authorities have sued the company, alleging it misled prospective students into enrolling with false job placement and graduation rates. Former students seeking to have their federal debts wiped have cited these lawsuits to show that they were duped into taking out federal student loans. Corinthian has denied the allegations.But the Education Department has been slow to process the claims or to tell distressed borrowers their options, leaving many in limbo as interest on their debt accumulates and the prospect of default looms.In fact, the Education Department and one of its loan contractors already has improperly denied at least two applications by erroneously claiming no such right exists. And the department has been silent in the face of numerous requests for information by borrower advocates, Senate Democrats and state attorneys general.On Monday, after nearly five months of waiting, the New York Legal Assistance Group filed a lawsuit against the department to compel the release of documents related to the defense against repayment provision.âThe departmentâs failure to produce any of the requested records is part and parcel of its stonewalling of students, legislators, and attorneys general on the whole issue of borrower defense to repayment,â said Eileen Connor, a lawyer at the New York group.To Waters, who battled bank regulators over the adequacy of the robo-signing review, only to watch them scrap the plan amid mounting costs and little relief for defrauded borrowers -- a âboondoggle,â she said -- the Education Departmentâs response thus far is âdistressinglyâ similar.âStudents -- many of whom are single mothers, veterans, and low-income people struggling with massive debt -- will reportedly be required to submit to the department individual applications answering complex legal questions,â Waters wrote in an opinion piece published Monday by The Hill, a Washington newspaper. âWithout the ability to afford an attorney, these students will likely have a difficult time documenting how they were misled by their Corinthian school and legally proving the losses they incurred.âThe Huffington Post in April reported that the Education Department was considering imposing new hurdles for student loan borrowers seeking to get out of their debts by claiming their schools swindled them. The department was considering hiring an outside party to rule on claims made by aggrieved borrowers.Groups of Senate Democrats and state prosecutors have asked the department to instead use evidence compiled by state and federal regulators as the basis for determining the validity of aggrieved borrowersâ applications, rather than forcing each borrower to prove that they were defrauded.On Monday, the Education Department seemed to provide evidence to back up Watersâ assertion when it posted 14 job openings for lawyers to adjudicate borrowersâ debt relief applications. Among the duties described in the job listing, which was up for only a few days before the department pulled it down, were research into state laws, analysis of individual claims and determinations of borrower injury.Denise Horn, an Education Department spokeswoman, said the job announcement was âpremature.ââOur administration is committed to making sure student who have been defrauded receive every penny of debt relief that they are entitled to and to making it as easy as possible for students who were defrauded or whose schools have closed, and we will hold institutions accountable,â Horn said in a statement. âWhile no final decisions have been made about how to accomplish that, we are clear that it will require some additional staff in our department.âWaters said she hopes Education Secretary Arne Duncan ultimately will give cheated borrowers the relief theyâre entitled to under federal law.âThe foreclosure and the student debt crises are similar in a lot of ways -- in both, we saw the targeting of minority communities and service members; high-pressure sales tactics mixed with financial products that many families didn't understand; poorly regulated industries run amok while regulators allowed clear problems to grow; and, in the end, we saw devastating harm caused to both families and to the taxpayer,â Waters said.She added, âBut this time, the Department of Education has the chance to do better. Now is the time for them to heed that lesson and provide broad-based relief to students.âCORRECTION: This article previously stated that a job listing for Education Department lawyers was only posted online for a few hours. The listing was up for a few days."

In conjunction with ""Main Street Vegan,"" co-authored with her daughter Adair, she launched her own radio show and Main Street Vegan Academy, ""a magical idea"" which has flowered into a week-long boutique certification program for vegan lifestyle coaches and educators. The program's had 160 graduates so far, all going out into the world to motivate others or even themselves ""to incorporate this vegan lifestyle in ways that work,"" says Moran.

You might even call it creating good karma.A gracious radio host, founder of MSV Academy, author of 11 previous books and one of the vegan coaches cheering you on for PCRM's 21-Day Vegan Kickstart, Moran has already generated plenty of good karma, so why write another book?

That means foods that are plant-based and animal-friendly... and more than vegan ice cream and cupcakes.""Choosing food full of life force energy, foods that don't come in any kind of package -- produce and beans, nuts, seeds"" puts the good karma on fast track. We're talking ""incredible perks,"" says Moran. ""Vitality, beauty, ease of maintaining the weight you like, having the years treat you well.""""The Good Karma Diet"" takes the warm welcome-to-vegan approach of Moran's previous book, the bestselling ""Main Street Vegan"", and ""takes things up a notch. If you're looking for heightened vitality, you're going to do a whole lot better eating more high green and high raw,"" says Moran. ""When I have a green juice or a smoothie with berries, I feel my superpowers.""Photo by: David RodgersShe's been flexing them, too. In conjunction with ""Main Street Vegan,"" co-authored with her daughter Adair, she launched her own radio show and Main Street Vegan Academy, ""a magical idea"" which has flowered into a week-long boutique certification program for vegan lifestyle coaches and educators. The program's had 160 graduates so far, all going out into the world to motivate others or even themselves ""to incorporate this vegan lifestyle in ways that work,"" says Moran. ""I feel I have this compassionate army out there spreading the word in a wonderful ripple effect."" You might even call it creating good karma.A gracious radio host, founder of MSV Academy, author of 11 previous books and one of the vegan coaches cheering you on for PCRM's 21-Day Vegan Kickstart, Moran has already generated plenty of good karma, so why write another book? ""To me, a book is a sacred thing, a book is always there. My goal is always to write a book people will want to go back to, to go on and inspire people.""Everyone needs inspiration -- even vegans, both plant-based newbies and those who's been living the lifestyle for a while. ""You might be the only vegan you know, you've become a minority,"" says Moran, who's been vegan for decades. ""I really want to support people to stay with it, to thrive, to be ecstatic about doing it.""Moran is. Going meatless in her teens, she found the health, weight and confidence she'd long wanted. But as she studied yoga, she became aware of the spiritual dimension behind a plant-based diet.

27,HEALTHY LIVING,The College Transition: Navigating the Deep End of the Pool,"Janine Francolini, ContributorFounder, The Flawless Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-college-transition-na_b_7269084.html,,2015-05-18,2015-05-12-1431463973-9741326-stockvaultmitbuildingthruhedge117606.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-12-1431463973-9741326-stockvaultmitbuildingthruhedge117606-thumb.jpg," via Stockvault.netIt's that time of year again. The universal reply date for colleges has just come and gone, so students are dealing with the aftermath of making a decision under a great deal of pressure. It would be nice to think that once the decision is made everything's smooth sailing, but I am seeing evidence all around me that says otherwise. In just one week:I got a call from one of my best childhood friends, desperate as her 17-year-old son -- a straight-A student -- was in a psychiatric hospital going through trials of treatment for extreme depression and anxiety with suicidal ideation. (I know this issue first-hand, since I attempted suicide my senior year in high school myself.)Another friend called distraught that her college freshman daughter on the other side of the country was suicidal and had dropped out of school.And yet another friend's daughter -- who last year was rejected from the school both her parents attended and smartly took a gap year to take some time from the intense pressure cooker of her competitive private school -- applied to a different legacy institution and was rejected yet again.The national media has noticed what's going on with our rising high school students. Last month New York Times columnist Frank Bruni's piece on ""the best, brightest -- and saddest"" Palo Alto high school students. The sons and daughters of our tech industry titans who've experienced a string of suicides among their stressed-out classmates. Two days later, The Wall Street Journal featured a range of expanded efforts to help teenagers heading for college deal with the mental health issues they may, or already do, face.For some, gap years between high school and college can be so, so helpful. I wish I had taken one, and my friend's daughter who just left school suddenly had been on the cusp of taking one before she enrolled. A gap year is one of many valuable options for students who are overwhelmed or stressed by making these important decisions. Tuning in and being self aware enough to make this type of plan for the year after high school is exactly the kind of self care and advocacy skills that students will need when they transition to college.As mentioned in the Wall Street Journal article, proactive approaches are important and a fine example of this is a college-readiness program for high school seniors with anxiety disorders and depression created by Dr. Anne Marie Albano, director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders. The importance of finding support and creating individualized solutions cannot be emphasized enough and was the overarching theme at this year's Saks Institute Spring Symposium at the USC Gould School of Law. The symposium's schedule always seems to dovetail with the college acceptance process, which makes its subject matter resonate strongly with my own experience and the tough news I've been hearing from my friends.The major message of the Saks symposium was that, despite the fact that mental health remains a public health emergency in this country, there is a new mental health paradigm on many campuses. Schools around the nation are responding to the challenges they see their students facing and are making changes. There is much to celebrate!I was struct by the fact that the words love, community, and mindfulness were seeded throughout the presentations by these thoughtful leaders. The emphasis in their work with students is on compassion, education, connection, and giving them the tools to care and advocate for themselves. It was one conversation after another filled with hope!We learned about programs that, as Saks Institute Board Chair Steve Behnke said so perfectly during his remarks, ""create places for students to learn and to grow in their wisdom."" The question for the rest of us is whether we can grow in our wisdom and create both high school and college environments that dial down the pressures all students are feeling these days, and provide the full range of compassionate, professional support for many students dealing with mental health challenges. The presenters from Cornell shared their powerful and inspiring ""Caring Community"" work with us. Can we learn from them and create caring communities on every campus? We all need help developing and maintaining skills of self-care and advocacy. We must remember that the health of our brains isn't a fixed quality with all of us living somewhere on this spectrum of mental health. If we're really concerned about an educational system that leaves no child behind and allows everyone to race to the top, such a commitment to mental health in our schools, colleges and communities is essential___________________ If you -- or someone you know -- need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

(Hold on, let me put my hand down, because it's hard to type this way.) I've compiled some of mine and hope you might add your own advice in the comments. Aging: Two of the greatest things about getting older are caring less about what other people think about you and thinking more of the people you care about. Bathroom: Whether it's starting at a new school or a new job, beginnings are hard. You don't know people. You don't know what you are supposed to be doing. You don't even know where the bathroom is. My advice is to start there -- find out where the bathroom is. The rest will come with time.Crowd: It's really easy to go along with the crowd, but it's not always the right thing to do -- especially when you are a teenager and some of your friends are, almost inevitably, idiots. Defend: Stick up for causes you believe in. Stick up for people who need it. And don't forget to stick up for yourself. Early: Do not arrive on time for job interviews and important meetings. Arrive early. Because then, if you're late, you're still on time. Facebook: When someone you're close to shares bad news on Facebook, don't ""like"" it. Pick up the phone. Grudges: If you wouldn't be able to explain why you're holding a grudge against someone to an impartial third party without sounding petty and pathetic, let it go. For what it's worth, a grudge mainly only bothers the person who holds it. High School: It's actually a good thing if high school isn't that fun. You'll just have more to look forward to after graduation.Inflexible: Convictions are one thing. Stubbornness is another. Don't be afraid to change your mind anytime, about anything and anyone. Jokes: When you're in a crappy mood, don't underestimate watching a funny movie or a great comedian. Sometimes, it's just a temporary Band-Aid. Sometimes, it's an actual cure.Kazoo: Learn to play an instrument. Unless you consider the kazoo an instrument. In that case, I'm not paying for your lessons. Losing: When it comes to losing, do it graciously and spell it with only one ""o."" The only thing worse than a sore loser is a sore ""looser.""MTV: It probably goes without saying, but please don't star in a reality show on MTV, unless it's a program documenting the lives of scientists curing cancer. ""No"": Be good at saying it and accepting it as an answer.Observation: I am not the first to say this (because if I were, I'd open an Etsy store with T-shirts and mugs), but always remember, ""This too shall pass."" As a kid, I first heard this from my mom, who pointed out that those words could make a happy person sad and a sad person happy. Plans: What doesn't go as planned often makes a good story. Sometimes it takes decades... says the girl who split her pants while playing kickball in the third grade. Quiet: Learn to listen without judgment and without interrupting. Particularly when it comes to opinions and advice from your loved ones. You don't have to agree. You do, however, owe it to them to listen.Rejection: I used to worry way too much about getting rejected. Don't. Getting rejected can't truly hurt you. Infection? Yes. (When in doubt, see a doctor!) But not rejection. Social Media: I have only two words for you: Post wisely. Try Not to Gossip: You will rarely regret the things you said, except when it comes to talking about people behind their backs. Try not to gossip, because a) it's mean and b) it may bite you hard in the butt one day. Ugh: Be confident. Not cocky. Venting: If you are mad at someone and want to vent over email, sleep on it before you hit ""enter."" Despite all of the advances in technology, you still can't wish away sent emails. Believe me, I've tried. Wet Clothes: Unless you like the smell of mildew, don't leave wet clothes in the washing machine overnight. Expiration Dates: Neither ""thank you"" nor ""I'm sorry"" have an expiration date. It's never too late to say either to someone. Speaking of expiration dates, check the ones on dairy carefully. (And yes, I'm aware that this one doesn't really start with an ""X."") Your Nails: Why does anyone do this in public? Please be aware that the time to trim your fingernails is not on a bus or train. The same, it should be said, goes for toenails.Zippers: Rubbing a sharpened pencil over the teeth of a stuck zipper can help it become unstuck. It's a crying shame that ""Z"" comes at the end of the alphabet, because this is by far the most useful piece of advice I have to offer.This list previously ran on the blog, Mammalingo.
