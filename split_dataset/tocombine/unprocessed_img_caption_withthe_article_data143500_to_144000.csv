I'm wearing glass slippers, of the Valentino crystal-set variety, but, unlike Cinderella, I can't afford to lose one; especially not before midnight. I have eleven minutes to reach my daily Fuel goal, and I've carefully calculated that my short but significant walk home will bring me that last lot of points that will set my Nike+ FuelBand--a fitness-tracking device nestled snugly on my wrist next to my grandmother's triple-strand pearl bracelet--aglow with LED lights blinking goal.What exactly does that mean? It means I've achieved my preprogrammed number of daily Fuel points--Nike's metric used to measure your movement and energy expenditure. Two thousand points are average; 3,000 is a more active day, and 5,000 indicates a high-energy 24 hours (Amar'e Stoudemire has his set at 5,000).SEE MORE: Top 10 Beauty, Health and Fitness Trends of the YearThe FuelBand--which notes your daily amount of steps taken and calories burned--is part of the Quantified Self movement, which argues that by amassing digital data about our lifestyle we will be motivated to live more healthfully. Nike isn't the only game in town: The Fitbit began as a money clip-like device that snapped onto your clothing, but recently evolved into a bracelet version; Jawbone's UP bands come in mint green and orange and have a sleeker, thinner design. BodyMedia's Link armband resembles a heart-rate monitor. In fashion circles, the FuelBand reigns supreme. It all began when Serena Williams strode onto Centre Court last year at Wimbledon sporting one next to her magenta sweatband. Was this the new tennis bracelet? Since then, they've started popping up on chic wrists all over town: Shala Monroque's got quite the tour of Paris at the recent couture collections; Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis has mixed hers into a medley of thin gold bangles, a Victorian locket chain, and an Aurélie Bidermann gold torque bracelet. Even Kanye West's wearing one! Right next to his Cartier Love cuff.  SEE MORE: Can a Workout Class Kill You? The first weekend my mother saw my icy-white FuelBand, she told me it was ugly and that it looked like a medical bracelet on someone too young to be wearing one. ""It's chic,"" I insisted. She gave me the same look of pity that is offered to my zigzag-print Nicholas Kirkwood sandals. The following weekend she was wearing the matte-black version and had gift-wrapped another for my stepfather. The three of us now fight to walk the dog on the weekend, a situation so novel it seems to deeply confuse Jerry, our Goldendoodle.Competitive FuelBanders can share their daily activity online--or, of course, in person. During a lull in a recent midmorning meeting, I leaned over and pressed the button on my neighboring colleague's band--a measly 790 points revealed that he had neither biked to work nor exercised that morning. When he returned the gesture and discovered my 1,910 points, he raised an eyebrow. Boxing, I scrawled onto a page of his notebook, with a victorious shrug. But the FuelBand isn't perfect: Running and walking are gold mines, while SoulCycle enthusiasts who pedal their hearts out receive paltry points due to the fact that their arms remain stationary. (Creative director Jen Brill subverts this by clipping hers onto her cycling shoes.) They aren't waterproof, either (note to self: Aqua-spinning is a bad way to earn Fuel points). The real allure, though, is discovering how much you move going about your regular business. It turns out I walk an average of five miles a day.

Because the invasion was a response to American incursions into British Canada, Canadian schoolchildren -- with the clarity of patriotism if not historical accuracy -- still grow up learning about this event as ""the time we burned down the White House."" But what if Canada really had taken over the U.S. government in 1814?, I sometimes wonder. What would an America under tyrannical Canadian rule look like? More polite? Cheaper health care? Would we all have to call macaroni and cheese ""Kraft dinner""? The best way to envision this nightmarish alternate-universe dystopia is to peek in on the quiet town of Hyder, Alaska.See Also:The Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities in the WorldHyder, population 87, is Alaska's easternmost town, a tiny town surrounded by lofty, glacier-covered peaks at the corner of the Alaska Panhandle. The town boomed in the early 20th century when gold and silver were discovered nearby, but is now so small that residents bill it as ""Alaska's friendliest ghost town."" The ferry to Ketchikan, the nearest Alaskan city, stopped running more than a decade ago.What's interesting about the residents of Hyder is that their only neighbors for miles and miles in any direction are the good people of Stewart, just ten minutes away -- but across the border into British Columbia. Stewart, as if you didn't know, is internationally famous as ""Canada's most northerly ice-free port!"" (Remember, the vast majority of Canada is a frigid, uninhabitable wasteland of no interest to anyone, even Canadians.)As a result of its geographic isolation, Hyder functions as America's only de facto outpost of Canada. All businesses (except the post office) price stuff in Canadian dollars, and take ""Victoria Day"" and ""Boxing Day"" off every year. Clocks are set to British Columbia time, the electricity comes from a B.C. utility, and the nearest police are Mounties. It's the only place in Alaska not to use the state's 907 area code -- even Hyder's phone numbers have joined in the open treason, and begin with a Canadian code, 250. Kids can be taught at home or bundled off to boarding school in Ketchikan, but many parents choose the dubious indoctrination of the Canadian public school system instead, especially up to the sixth grade. (Oops, sorry, Canada. ""Grade 6."")And how is this un-American lifestyle working out for Hyder? Pretty well, from what I can tell. It's a popular vacation getaway from Americans looking to hunt, fish, or gawk at all the grizzly bears stalking salmon in the creeks just outside of town. It's also a popular destination for Canadians looking for a quick way to cross Alaska off their bucket lists. If you make the trip to Hyder, don't forget to stop at a local bar to become ""Hyderized."" Tourist earn a special certificate for drinking the local specialty: 190 proof Everclear. After a couple shots of that, even I might welcome our new Canadian overlords.More from Condé Nast Traveler: Is This the Best Job of All Time?

2,WELLNESS,How To Make Your Own Yoga Props,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saving-money-on-yoga_us_5b9d80b1e4b03a1dcc88d6b6,"By Laura McMullen for U.S News Or, given the money you've saved on blocks, straps and eye masks (and perhaps avoiding the",2013-09-12,Yoga mats rolled up and ready for a class with a stack of blocks and straps. Colorful mats.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d80b12500003300367c92.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Laura McMullen for U.S NewsIt's easy to assume yoga is expensive. Classes may set you back 20 bucks each; $90 stretch pants may tempt you; and the cost of all that equipment -- mats, rolls, bolsters, straps, eye masks -- may resurface the very stress you calmed in your last $20 yoga class.More From U.S. News: People Changing The Face Of Yoga Yoga For People Who Are Overweight Or Obese Prenatal Yoga: What You Should KnowRelax. (Remember those deep breaths.) Yes, depending on which route you go, yoga can be pricey. But there are many ways to cut costs. For one, consider dropping a few of those classes and practicing downward dog on your own.Another money saver? Make your own yoga props at home. Below, Abby Lentz, founder of the HeavyWeight Yoga classes and DVDs, which are aimed at yogis who are overweight and obese, shares a few of her favorite homemade yoga props.Yoga blocks can help yogis deepen certain stretches, achieve hard-to-reach poses and improve alignment. These rectangular blocks are typically made of foam, cork or wood and -- on the cheap end -- can set you back about eight bucks for a pair.While you can find these props in a sporting goods store, you can likely find a cheaper substitute in your pantry. Lentz suggests using canned goods for blocks. Try, for example, a family-size can of ravioli that's about 10 inches tall.Dictionaries and other large books can also serve as blocks. (While the decline of print media has been challenging for some industries, we're glad it's benefiting cash-strapped yogis.) If you have a big book you haven't opened in the last decade or find one for cheap at a used book store, tightly tape it closed with layers of duct tape so the pages don't splay and it's one solid unit. Another tech boom casualty: the phone book. Slip a piece of hard cardboard about halfway between its pages to make it more sturdy, and tightly tape it closed to make a yellow-paged yoga block.Yoga straps can be a lifesaver for yogis who need a little boost in flexibility. Imagine your instructor leads you into a pose that you're not quite flexible enough to completely achieve. Instead of sitting out that pose or worse -- attempting it and hurting yourself in the process -- consider using a yoga strap, which works to extend your limbs and achieve the benefits of that pose.These props are simple -- they're typically just sturdy, cotton straps with buckles. Lentz suggests making your own at home by knotting two neckties together. If you don't have neckties handy, find them for a buck at a thrift store, or make your strap from a bathrobe sash, she adds.Eye masks are sometimes used in yoga during savasana, or corpse pose, in which yogis attempt total relaxation. The eye masks, also called eye pillows, block the light and provide a gentle, soothing pressure around your forehead and eyes. Here's a quick way to create your own eye pillow at home in about a minute: Take a clean white tube sock, fill it with dry beans or rice, and then tie the end of the sock or sew it shut, Lentz suggests. YogaHound and LiveStrong also list how-tos for making slightly more complex eye bags, for those who aren't afraid to do a little more sewing.Yoga mats are one of the few yoga props that Lentz hasn't been able to substitute. Some people who practice at home may skip the mat and do their poses on the carpet. Lentz says that's fine for sitting and lying postures, but it's not ideal for standing, as the pile may be too thick for steady footing. She suggests moving to an area of your home with hardwood or tile floors for standing postures.Or, given the money you've saved on blocks, straps and eye masks (and perhaps avoiding the $90 stretch pants), consider investing in a mat. Shop around at big box stores such as Walmart and Target, discount stores such as TJ Maxx and Marshalls, sporting good stores and online, and finding a basic mat under $20 should be a cinch. "

He considers you a friend.""I never, ever get tired of having people come up to me,"" the P90X fitness guru says. ""If you've done my program and you have something to say -- you have a before and after picture -– you are instantly a bud. Absolutely.""During a roundtable discussion at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., last week, Horton, 55, treated about 10 health and fitness bloggers like they were old buddies. He poured water for the group ahead of time, teasing that he was only doing so if they promised to ""tweet nice things"" about him.More from US News: 7 Mind-Blowing Benefits of Exercise Quiz: Which Celebs Credit Their Fitness to P90X? How to Overcome a Workout RutHorton didn't need to do much convincing -– as one blogger reminded him, he has a cult following that stretches around the globe. Indeed, the 90-day program –- which works by mixing elements of body weight training, cardio, yoga and martial arts –- has sold more than 3.5 million copies since 2005. And Horton plans to use that opportunity well. ""One of the things that's most important to me is making sure more and more people have the information they need to live a long and happy life,"" he says. ""You should train because you want to be happy. It's all about happiness and wellness and being less vulnerable to illness and injury. That's why I do this.""Horton opened up about the past, present and what we can expect from him in the future. Here are snippets from the conversation:Were you athletic as a kid?My father was a three-sport captain, and he introduced me to golf, tennis and skiing. I didn't make the tennis team, and I just barely made the football team. I think I was more of a tackling dummy than a player –- my jersey only got dirty during warm-ups prior to the game. I used to roll around in the mud so it looked like I had played.Fast forward to your 20s and 30s, when you spent time as a retail worker, carpenter, actor and Chippendales strip dancer. How did you transition into training and, ultimately, P90x?I moved to California in 1980 because I wanted to be an actor. I really went there as a summer vacation, and then September came around and I stayed. I was a trained pantomime -– I was a shy kid who had a tough time communicating, so miming was my way to communicate physically. I'd go down to the Santa Monica Pier and mime for two hours and make $25, and then I'd live on Cheerios and yogurt for three days. I was also a go-go dancer with Chippendales. I earned $33.50 an hour there -– a lot of money for a kid who didn't have a lot of money.I liked the gym vibe a lot, and at one point, I was working as a runner at 21st Century Fox. My boss said, ""Man, you're getting fit."" So I started training him, and next thing you know I'm training secretaries and executives on the lot.My first celebrity client was Tom Petty -– I got him ready for his tour. At one point, my day was pretty interesting. I had Tom, Billy Idol, Annie Lennox, Stephen Stills and Stevie Nicks. So I had all these rockers during the 70s and 80s, and my job was to keep them healthy and fit. I later met Carl Daikeler, the CEO of Beachbody, and did the ""Great Body Guaranteed!"" routine with him. He said I should make a video of the other program I was doing, and we decided to call it Power 90. Life changed pretty dramatically after that.Did you ever think P90X would explode the way it has?Not in a billion years. I lived in the same apartment for 21 and a half years, I was $60,000 in debt, and I had a broken down car. I remember getting a check in the mail for an infomercial I did, and it was for $23.40. Great, I'm going to go buy lunch! And then all of a sudden you get a royalty check and realize you have access to millions of people across the country.Here it is 10 years later, and we've done P90X and P90X2. We're going to release another one -– and I can't even tell you what it's going to be called -– but we think it's going to be massive. I also have a new book, ""The Big Picture,"" coming out Feb. 8.You've filmed hundreds of different workouts. What's your absolute favorite?Chest and Back -– any kind of workout where you're doing constant pull-ups and push-ups, to the point where you just want to hurl.That and Yoga X, because yoga saved my life, absolutely. It was the most important step in my process of learning about exercise. Yoga is the fountain of youth, there's no question about it. It's a monster. The reason yoga is in there is that it's that thing you're in fear of, to some level, be it patience or range of motion or balance or strength. It's like running on your hands, you know. It's just hard. But the idea here is to keep pushing. Look at P90X -– it forced you to work on your weaknesses, and so many people hit that wall and then said, ""OK, I'm out. I'm always going to gravitate toward something easier."" But the thing you despise the most is the most important. That's why I started doing Pilates -– I was so horrible at it. And the reason I'm as well-rounded as I am athletically is because I keep doing things I stink at.You're serving as Honorary Race Marshall at the National Press Club's 5K on Sept. 7. What will you eat for breakfast beforehand?I'll have my usual steel-cut oatmeal with water, blackberries and blueberries -– no salt, no sugar. And then I'll probably have four or five egg whites scrambled with sautéed onions, peppers and basil -– double the basil -– and I'll throw some slices of avocado on top of that. I'll probably skip the toast. That's pretty much what I have most days, except just the oatmeal, or maybe a shake.You recently led workouts aboard the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. Why is working with the military important to you?I've been on 36 military tours around the world, from Japan to Kosovo, from Germany to the Netherlands. I'm doing four bases in Florida in October. And what do they pay you to do these things? Zero. You do it because it's the right thing to do. If you really want to grow and expand and change things, you make time in your schedule to volunteer. Altruism is really important and, ultimately, 10 times more fun than the rest of the stuff.How many pull-ups can you do without stopping?I can do 40. Here's a challenge to anyone out there: We do a fun routine called 30-30. How quickly can you do 30 pull-ups and 30 push-ups? My best is one minute flat."
4,WELLNESS,Michelle Obama Wants You To Drink More Water,Amanda L. Chan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-drink-water-campaign_us_5b9d80f4e4b03a1dcc88db7b,"But if kids start drinking more water but keep drinking soda, the purpose of the initiative would be undermined.

On a call announcing Michelle Obama's newest healthy living initiative Wednesday, Let's Move Executive Director Sam Kass explained that the White House is working with cities, private companies and public taps to promote the message to ""drink up."" Participating companies include Brita, Poland Spring, Evian, Dasani, Voss and others, which will carry a ""Drink Up"" logo on their bottles, and participating cities include Chicago, Los Angeles county, Houston and, appropriately, Watertown, Wis., where the First Lady is visiting Thursday to kick off the initiative.""Every participating company is only focusing on drinking water,"" Kass said, and not on why its particular brand of water is ""better"" than another. Kass cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that show 43 percent of Americans drink fewer than four cups of water a day, and about one in four kids don't drink water at all on a given day. An author of the CDC study, Dr. Alyson Goodman, said the first finding ""likely indicates that many people either choose less healthy beverages to satisfy their thirst or drink little water daily.""Noticeably absent from the new campaign to drink more water are the reasons why people should do so. Hydration is vital to a healthy, well-functioning body because it maintains body temperature at a normal level, promotes removal of waste from the body (through urination and perspiration), lubricates joints and protects the body's tissues. And drinking water instead of sugary drinks is a good way to decrease daily sugar consumption, which has been linked to obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Yet Kass explained that the tone of the initiative will purposely not emphasize these factors, unlike some past public health pushes. Instead, the campaign is focusing more on ""being positive and not getting [into] details about what a glass of water can do,"" he told reporters on the call.A positive campaign ""to inspire people to drink more water is the most effective way to get people to get water that they need,"" Kass said. ""We think people respond really well to positive messages ... Water is the simplest, most accessible choice that people can make if they're trying to make a healthy choice. Encouraging that is the most effective strategy."" A LOOK AT THE STRATEGYBut is simply telling people to drink more water really the best way to promote health?If the new initiative isn't going to put a heavy focus on why people should drink more water, David Katz, M.D., founding director of Yale University's Prevention Research Center and a HuffPost blogger, doesn't think so. ""I do think there are positive ways to move in that direction to emphasize what to eat and drink, but at the end of the day, there has to be [an understanding of why to drink water] instead of something more caloric,"" he told HuffPost. Katz, who is also the editor-in-chief of the journal Childhood Obesity, said the campaign is likely trying to get people to drink water rather than sugary beverages -- and any health expert would agree that's a good thing. After all, a recent Harvard study suggested sugary drink consumption was linked to as many as 180,000 deaths around the world and 25,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2010 alone.But if kids start drinking more water but keep drinking soda, the purpose of the initiative would be undermined. ""There's not an epidemic of dehydration, there's an epidemic of obesity,"" Katz said. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, agreed with Katz, saying the push to ""drink up"" is probably another way of saying ""stop drinking soda,"" since ""drinking water itself is not going to do anything about obesity.""But if the initiative doesn't clarify that people need to drink water instead of caloric beverages, then the message will be lost -- and more along the lines of, ""Gee, I need to drink more water. Oh, it comes in bottles, how convenient. And isn't it nice that these bottled water companies are sponsoring,"" Nestle said. She speculated that possible pushback from soda and food companies -- some of which own bottled water brands -- could factor into why the ""drink up"" campaign isn't putting a focus on quitting sugary drinks. (Evian water is owned by Danone Group, Poland Spring is manufactured by Nestle (no relation), and Dasani is owned by the Coca-Cola Company.) Nestle also noted that the initiative could increase the amount of waste produced by plastic bottles. The push does come as the United States is already experiencing an uptick in water consumption, with Beverage Digest reporting earlier this year that water is now the No. 1 drink in the country. Meanwhile, the amount of soda consumed by Americans has dropped 17 percent from its peak in 1998, the Associated Press reported. Lawrence A. Soler, president and CEO of the Partnership for a Healthier America, explained on Wednesday's call that while this trend is positive, more work should be done.""There's a lot of momentum we can piggy-back off of with this campaign, and that's why we're pushing it,"" he said. HOW DRINKING 'MORE WATER' AFFECTS HEALTHThe National Institutes of Health notes on its website that ""experts usually recommend drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily."" But there aren't actually any official guidelines for suggested intake. In fact, that advice to drink eight glasses of water a day is generally regarded as outdated, with mostly bottled water companies pushing the notion, a recent British Medical Journal article noted. The Institute of Medicine says most people actually do get enough water to meet their bodies' needs every day ""by letting thirst be their guide."" According to a 2004 report by the IOM, there are no ""exact requirements for water,"" but the institute's Food and Nutrition Board did set recommendations for women ""at approximately 2.7 liters (91 ounces) of total water -- from all beverages and foods -- each day, and men an average of approximately 3.7 liters (125 ounces daily) of total water."" The panel did not set a limit for water consumption.People also receive some hydration through the food they eat, particularly fruits and vegetables, said Stanley Goldfarb, M.D., F.A.C.P., a nephrologist and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.Of course, that doesn't take away from the importance of maintaining proper hydration throughout the day. Dehydration, when mild, can lead to headaches and feelings of sluggishness. When more severe, it can lead to complications such as heat injury if you don't hydrate properly while exercising, kidney failure, brain swelling, seizures, coma and even death. Particularly at-risk groups for dehydration include elderly people and babies, Nestle said, as well as athletes and people who live in higher altitudes. There's no particular harm in drinking extra water for most people, and the only real effects may be needing to urinate more often during the day (though increased nighttime urination could disturb sleep), Goldfarb noted. And there are some people who could stand to benefit from drinking more water, such as those with kidney stones. But overall, the experts agree that there isn't much benefit to drinking more H20 if you're already hydrated. ""I don't think there's any good evidence that that will produce much in the way of health,"" Goldfarb said."

Of the 2,081 UK adults surveyed by Mobile Phone Checker, 62 percent of men admitted to snooping through a partner's phone, compared to only 34 percent of women who said the same. (Note that Mobile Phone Checker only surveyed people who are currently in relationships). Eighty-nine percent of the people who admitted to cell phone snooping said that their motivation was to make sure that their partner was not cheating or talking to anyone else in a romantic or sexual way. And sure enough, 48 percent of people said that their snooping did turn up evidence of infidelity. And while men were more likely to look through a partner's phone, women are more likely to actually confront a significant other about what they found. Fifty-nine percent of women said they would talk to their partner about their findings, while only 37 percent of men said the same.If the tables were turned on the survey's respondents and they discovered that their significant other was snooping, 31 percent of people said they would consider ending the relationship.This isn't the first time a study has looked at how modern communication impacts relationships. In June 2013, researchers found that Facebook use can negatively affect relationships. And that same month, divorce lawyer Marilyn Stowe said that a partner who heavily guards his or her cell phone may very well be cheating.Click through the slideshow below for even more fascinating divorce research.Keep in touch!
