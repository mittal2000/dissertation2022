PHR works with a network of physicians who, despite the continuous attacks on medical personnel, continue to risk their lives to treat those in need and document evidence of torture and sexual violence for future war-crimes prosecutions.One of those physicians, whom we’ll call Dr. Lena, has been working with PHR since 2013. Before fleeing Syria in 2011, her husband, also a physician, was detained and tortured by government forces. Two of her close family members were arrested and are still unaccounted for. Undeterred, Dr. Lena continues to work in Turkey, providing care for some of the country’s 3 million Syrian refugees. Last month, she traveled to the United States to advocate on behalf of her colleagues – and to receive the 2016 Physicians for Human Rights Award in New York.She sat down with PHR’s executive director Donna McKay for a conversation about her work, her motivations, her personal safety and her dreams for the future of Syria. What follows is an edited and condensed version of that conversation.McKay: Dr. Lena, help me understand a little bit about what makes Syria such a dangerous place to practice medicine?Dr. Lena: I think it’s related to the risk of being arrested. For a physician who works anyplace in Syria, whether it’s in areas held by the regime or the opposition, there is a risk. And for me, I cannot be there anymore, because there is a risk even to see my family.McKay: But why specifically are physicians and medical workers targeted?Dr. Lena: Because in the eyes of the regime, they are assisting the opposition. They are helping injured people who are against the regime. At the beginning of the revolution in 2011, government forces just arrested the doctors. There was no ISIS at that time, no armed groups, no fighting, nothing else – just they arrested the physicians who were treating those who were wounded or injured during anti-government demonstrations.They also arrested people like my husband just because he and his colleagues tried to organize a network of field clinics with some medical equipment [to treat injured protesters]. That enough is a reason for the regime to arrest you. When I was notified of my husband’s arrest, the arrest report just said that he was helping the injured. That was written as the reason for his arrest.In the last two years or so, the regime has been targeting medical facilities for airstrikes, and you can’t say it’s a mistake. One time, two times, you can understand – that would make sense for you if it’s a mistake. But some facilities like Bab al-Hawa Hospital have been struck six times. A doctor’s car was targeted, an MSF hospital was targeted. They know. It’s not a mistake.McKay: What got you interested in working to document human rights abuses in Syria?Dr. Lena: Before I trained with PHR [in documenting human rights abuses], I met a lot of survivors, and I was treating them as a physician. I didn’t approach what happened to them in a systematic way – to evaluate them, to have some evidence, and to make sure that I can document evidence of what they’ve experienced.But later on, after the PHR training, I found that it’s very important to document the cases as early as possible to keep evidence so that a strong file can be brought to court. You hear stories of detainees, a lot of stories about violations of human rights, but if you don’t have evidence you cannot do anything to prosecute the criminals.At this moment, we don’t have a mechanism for accountability or to prosecute the criminals, but at least maybe in the future in Syria we can work to make reparations for those victims and help them lead normal lives or reinvolve them in society.The standard I want is that criminals should be prosecuted to keep Syria connected, because there can be no peace without justice. So it’s very important for the future of Syria. It may take 20 years or more, but at least in Syria we can offer some kind of justice for the people who are suffering.McKay: Do you worry that the work you’re doing puts you at greater risk?Dr. Lena: Yes, I am worried. I try to do my best to protect myself and my family, but it’s a risky job. I’m personally committed to this documentation work because two of my own family members are still missing inside Syria.McKay: Wars end, and this war will end. What do you dream about when this war is over? What are you hopeful for?Dr. Lena: I hope I can go back to Syria as soon as possible. I’d have to have guarantees that I wouldn’t be detained and that airstrikes would end, mainly for my children, because I would feel guilty if any of my family members were hurt. I will go back soon to Syria, and I hope that I will participate in rebuilding Syria and helping my people.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

Cleveland went up 21-19 at the end of the first quarter, only to get outscored 91-56 the rest of the way. Two-time MVP Stephen Curry played just 25 minutes and seemed barely necessary as the Warriors' Draymond Green went 5-8 from three on the way to 28 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists.At times, Curry could only celebrate from the sideline while Green eclipsed him and Klay Thompson as the team's top marksman from beyond the arc.The Cavaliers often looked lost on defense and almost listless the rest of the time, regularly leaving Warriors open near the basket for easy layups. On offense, they were off the mark in every conceivable way: 35 percent from the field, 67 percent from the line and 22 percent from three. Perhaps even more importantly for the Cavaliers, Kevin Love was placed in the league's concussion protocol program after getting hit to the head by Harrison Barnes in the second quarter. Love stayed in the game, but later appeared visibly disoriented and took himself out.Kevin Love receives a hit to the head in Game 2 of the NBA Finals. Kevin Love appeared disoriented in the third period.Kyrie Irving appeared outmatched on defense and only scored 10 points on 5-14 shooting. LeBron James had 19 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists, but looked worse than the box scored implied.Instead of really going into it much more, we're just going to embed some Warriors plays involving Green and call it a night. Boy was this a doozy. See you Wednesday for Game 3.In summary:CORRECTION: A earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed the below tweet to Magic Johnson, but it is actually a parody account.

In commemorating D-Day with a photo labeled ""#DDay - June 6, 1944,"" Trump instead used a photo from a training exercise in 1943.The photo he used is a Keystone image, and Trump -- or one of the best and brightest he has surrounded himself with -- apparently overlooked its caption in the Getty archives. Getty's archives are not always precise when it comes to captions, which can lead to these kinds of errors. But the photo itself should have given it away: The troops taking the beach seem to be encountering zero resistance, and one person is even standing casually with his hands on his hips.Trump, of course, ducked serving in the Vietnam War. His war experience consists of being shipped off to a military boarding school as a bratty teen, from which he emerged a bratty late-teen.The real estate mogul tends to eschew policy specifics when pressed on his agenda, arguing that he will hire the greatest people available and manage them with brilliance. Trump apparently has not put that strategy in place for his campaign -- which, as MSNBC reported Monday, does not functionally exist. And to the extent it does, it has committed one unforced error after another. At least he didn't use a photo of Nazis this time.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Legend and Teigen quickly took Morgan to task, tweeting back at him and starting a little spat:Morgan attempted a pitiful comeback by insulting Teigen's job, but -- naturally-- she utterly destroyed him. Morgan continued to respond to Teigen and Legend, baiting them with his controversial article about racism and boxing great Ali -- two things he knows little about. As the day continued, Teigen still found a way to top Morgan's foolish tweets. Recently, Morgan courted controversy when he wrote a column declaring he didn't like Beyoncé’s new ""political, race-fueled tone"" after her album, ""Lemonade,"" came out.

Hesselblad was born into Sweden's Lutheran church in 1870. She immigrated to the United States as a teenager, to help support her family. She studied nursing at a New York hospital, where she reportedly took care of many Catholic patients. She converted into the faith, a decision that would eventually lead her to Rome. She helped to create an order of religious sisters centered around the legacy of Saint Bridget. Hesselblad became Mother Superior of a Bridgettine convent in Rome. During the German occupation of that city, Hesselblad reportedly helped to hide political fugitives and at least 12 Jewish people in her convent between December 1943 and June 1944. According to Arborelius, the saint allowed the families to say prayers at makeshift synagogue in the convent. Israel's Yad Vashem, an organization that preserves the memory of the victims of the Holocaust, designated Hesselblad as one of the ""Righteous Among the Nations,"" a title given to non-Jews who helped save Jewish lives during the Holocaust.""Hesselblad revealed herself as a charismatic personality who took great risks in saving [the families] and helping other persons in need,"" the organization writes on its website. ""[She] never tried to convince them to convert, on the contrary, insisting that they [say] their Hebrew prayers and fulfill other obligations of their religion."" ""After the war, the rescued Jews retained a vivid memory of their benefactor, regarding themselves very fortunate to have met such an outstanding person.""Hesselblad died in Rome in 1957, when she was 87 years old. She was beatified -- which is the first step towards sainthood -- in 2000 by Saint John Paul II.

It has since carried out what is widely believed to have been a nuclear test.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has no access to North Korea and mainly monitors its activities by satellite, said last year it had seen signs of a resumption of activity at Yongbyon, including at the main reactor.""Resumption of the activities of the 5 megawatt reactor, the expansion of centrifuge-related facility, reprocessing, these are some of the examples of the areas (of activity indicated at Yongbyon),"" IAEA chief Yukiya Amano told a news conference during a quarterly IAEA Board of Governors meeting.Centrifuges are machines that enrich uranium, a process that can purify the element to the level needed for use in the core of a nuclear weapon. Reprocessing involves obtaining plutonium from spent reactor fuel, the other main route to a bomb.""There are indications the reprocessing plant at Yongbyon has been reactivated,"" an IAEA spokesman said later on Monday. ""It is possible that it is reprocessing spent fuel."" Little is known about the quantities of weapons-grade uranium or plutonium that North Koreapossesses, or its ability to produce either, though plutonium from spent fuel at Yongbyon is widely believed to have been used in its nuclear bombs.North Korea has come under tightening international pressure over its nuclear weapons program, including tougher U.N. sanctions adopted in March backed by its lone major ally China, following its most recent nuclear test in January.The website 38 North reported in April that exhaust plumes had been detected on two or three occasions in recent weeks from the thermal plant at Yongbyon's Radiochemical Laboratory, the site's main reprocessing installation.The U.S. national intelligence director said in February that North Korea could be weeks away from recovering plutonium from Yongbyon, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee that it had also expanded its uranium enrichment facility there."

Trump has been taking heat since claiming Thursday that Gonzalo Curiel, a federal judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University, has an “absolute conflict” because of the judge’s Mexican heritage. He repeatedly referred to Curiel as “Mexican” and said he couldn’t be an impartial judge because of Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border. Curiel is American and was born in Indiana.Democrats and some Republicans have condemned Trump’s comments, but GOP leaders really, really don’t want to talk about it.“I don’t agree with what he had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else,” McConnell said. “That’s an important part of what makes America work.”When host Chuck Todd read aloud a quote from conservative blogger Erick Erickson accusing “the party of Lincoln” of defending a racist candidate, McConnell said the bottom line is that Republicans want to win the presidential race.“I think the party of Lincoln wants to win the White House,” he said. “The right-of-center world needs to respect the fact that the primary voters have spoken.”McConnell similarly avoided the racism question on Friday, when asked about it during an interview on MSNBC.“Donald Trump is certainly a different kind of candidate,” he said.Top Democrats seized on the GOP leader’s unwillingness to condemn his party’s presidential frontrunner.“Senator McConnell’s evasions are exactly the kind of moral cowardice that led to Donald Trump’s rise,” said Kirsten Orthman, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), whose name has been floated as a vice presidential pick for Trump, was also asked the question on ABC’s “This Week.” He was more blunt about wanting to move on.“I don’t condone the comments and we can press on to another topic,” Corker said.This piece has been updated with comment from Reid’s office.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Still, many voters remain wary as some of Fujimori's new associates become mired in fresh scandals.""I remember what her father was like, and I think she would be the same. He controlled the media and was extremely corrupt,"" said Angela Agrela, a housewife who was voting for Kuczynski.While both candidates are fiscal conservatives who would maintain a free-market model in the resource-rich Andean economy, their styles and approaches differ widely.The election pits the Fujimori family's brand of conservative populism against Kuczynski's elite background and stiff technocratic style, which has curbed his appeal in poor provinces and working-class districts.Fujimori, who has repeatedly said democracy is not at risk, waged a more energetic campaign than her rival, whirling out regional dances in far-flung villages where she has promised to deliver tractors and portrayed her rival as out of touch with struggling Peruvians.Many in rural provinces have fond memories of her father, who built schools and hospitals and is credited with ending the violent Shining Path insurgency.The younger Fujimori has responded to the top voter concern, crime, with a hard-line stance that includes support for the death penalty and promises to lock up the most dangerous criminals in five new prisons she would have built high in the Andes.Asked why her running mate, who journalists claim gave them a tampered recording, was not at a traditional election-day breakfast on Sunday, Fujimori said she had opted for a family meal with her two daughters and American husband.Fujimori defends her associates and says her party has been the victim of a smear campaign before Peru's fourth democratic election since her father's authoritarian government collapsed in 2000.'DEMOCRACY AND UNITY'Kuczynski, a former prime minister, has portrayed himself as honest and experienced enough to make good on promises to revive sluggish economic growth, and has captured the anti-Fujimori vote despite having endorsed her over Humala in 2011.""I hope democracy and unity win,"" he said at his breakfast in Lima, surrounded by the beat of Afro-Peruvian drummers.If he wins, Kuczynski would have to reckon with a solid majority of Fujimori's party in Congress and a leftist alliance that has promised not to align with either of them.The Ipsos poll seen by Reuters on Saturday said a strong debate performance, corruption allegations plaguing Fujimori's inner circle, and the support of a former leftist candidate had helped Kuczynski in the final days of the campaign.But if recent history is any guide, Fujimori has a good chance of eking out a victory.

Still, many voters remain wary as some of Fujimori's new associates become mired in fresh scandals.""I remember what her father was like, and I think she would be the same. He controlled the media and was extremely corrupt,"" said Angela Agrela, a housewife who was voting for Kuczynski.While both candidates are fiscal conservatives who would maintain a free-market model in the resource-rich Andean economy, their styles and approaches differ widely.The election pits the Fujimori family's brand of conservative populism against Kuczynski's elite background and stiff technocratic style, which has curbed his appeal in poor provinces and working-class districts.Fujimori, who has repeatedly said democracy is not at risk, waged a more energetic campaign than her rival, whirling out regional dances in far-flung villages where she has promised to deliver tractors and portrayed her rival as out of touch with struggling Peruvians.Many in rural provinces have fond memories of her father, who built schools and hospitals and is credited with ending the violent Shining Path insurgency.The younger Fujimori has responded to the top voter concern, crime, with a hard-line stance that includes support for the death penalty and promises to lock up the most dangerous criminals in five new prisons she would have built high in the Andes.Asked why her running mate, who journalists claim gave them a tampered recording, was not at a traditional election-day breakfast on Sunday, Fujimori said she had opted for a family meal with her two daughters and American husband.Fujimori defends her associates and says her party has been the victim of a smear campaign before Peru's fourth democratic election since her father's authoritarian government collapsed in 2000.'DEMOCRACY AND UNITY'Kuczynski, a former prime minister, has portrayed himself as honest and experienced enough to make good on promises to revive sluggish economic growth, and has captured the anti-Fujimori vote despite having endorsed her over Humala in 2011.""I hope democracy and unity win,"" he said at his breakfast in Lima, surrounded by the beat of Afro-Peruvian drummers.If he wins, Kuczynski would have to reckon with a solid majority of Fujimori's party in Congress and a leftist alliance that has promised not to align with either of them.The Ipsos poll seen by Reuters on Saturday said a strong debate performance, corruption allegations plaguing Fujimori's inner circle, and the support of a former leftist candidate had helped Kuczynski in the final days of the campaign.But if recent history is any guide, Fujimori has a good chance of eking out a victory. Every president since 2000 has first faced defeat in a run-off race in the previous election.""She's ready, and deserves the chance to clear her father's name,"" said Santiago Celez, a 70-year-old taxi driver.

I find that fabulous and sensational,"" he told SRF.""When I see the media interest, from abroad as well, then I say we are setting a trend.""Conservative Switzerland is the first country to hold a national referendum on an unconditional basic income, but others including Finland are examining similar plans as societies ponder a world where robots replace humans in the workforce.Olivier, a 26-year-old carpenter who works on construction sites and runs a small business designing and building furniture, said he voted ""yes.""""For me it would be a great opportunity to put my focus on my passion and not go to work just for a living,"" he said.SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION?Champions of the plan portrayed a more automated future in a poster bigger than a soccer field asking ""What would you do if your income was secure?"" They had also marched as robots down Zurich's high street and handed out free 10-franc notes.""I voted 'yes' because money does not really have its place in this world, it is so arbitrary and linked to power games,"" said Ronnie Lehmann, 37, who makes less than 4,000 francs a month as a bicycle mechanic. ""But I'm not surprised the proposal got rejected, the world is not ready for it yet.""A woman named Meleanie said she reluctantly voted ""no.""""I find that it is a real danger that once people just get their basic needs covered society doesn't feel responsible any more to look after the ones who can't really handle the situation on their own,"" she said.In a separate vote on Sunday, Swiss voters clearly rejected a proposal to require state-controlled companies, such as Swisscom, not to seek to make a profit.The government had warned that accepting the initiative would hurt the companies' competitiveness and could lead to higher taxes.Employers heaved a sigh of relief that Switzerland, where unemployment is only around 3.5 percent, had not become the first country to embrace the guaranteed income measure.The Swiss government had urged voters to reject the campaign, saying the scheme would cost too much and undermine social cohesion.Interior Minister Alain Berset said the vote showed Swiss voters supported the economic and social system in place ""and that this system works well.""The plan included replacing in full or in part what people got from social benefits.The government estimated the proposal would have cost 208 billion Swiss francs a year, significantly weakened the economy and discouraged people, especially low earners, from working.Much of the cost could have been covered by existing social security payments, but sharp spending cuts or tax increases would have had to make up a remaining gap of 25 billion.An advanced social safety net already supports people who cannot pay for their own livelihood. Fewer than seven percent of people lived in poverty in 2014, official data show."

""I am very fortunate to have grown up in a home where I learned from an early age that everyone should be treated equally,"" Gomez said. ""I went back and forth on whether I should cancel my concert in North Carolina and ultimately I think what is right for me is to move forward with my show and donate a portion of the proceeds to Equality North Carolina and their effort to defeat this act of discrimination.""She added, ""I've been reassured the venue I will be performing in has gender neutral bathrooms as I want everyone coming to my show to be welcomed. I feel like my generation is the most progressive one yet and believe there will be a day soon when laws like HB2 won't even be a consideration.""Stars such as Jimmy Buffet and Ellen DeGeneres have already spoken out against HB2, while Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Maroon 5 canceled their concerts in protest. “Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry — which is happening as I write — is one of them,” Springsteen wrote in a statement after announcing his decision to cancel a show in April. Gomez's fellow Disney alums, Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas, also decided to scrap their North Carolina concert in response to HB2. In a statement, the duo called the law ""disappointing"" but assured fans ""we will not allow this to stop us from continuing to make progress for equality and acceptance.""

That he's weak on foreign policy? A bully? A bigot? Not as wealthy as he says? Not a great businessman?No. Despite all those being accurate descriptions, those have all already been tried, with almost no success. The worst, most damaging thing you can say about him is this: He's not very interesting. He's a bore. Calling him that is the one thing he won't be able to stand, since the constant spotlight is his addiction.But he is a bore. Of the crashing variety. This is heretical I know. There seems to be nearly universal agreement that even if one detests Trump, it has to be said he is a great entertainer.Sorry. He isn't. He is bumbling. He isn't very bright (yes, I know he tells us about his great brain every day). He says the same thing over and over. He never changes his style -- it is always abrasive and in your face. He always adds his irritating little tag lines (""Candidate so and so is a lightweight, THAT I CAN TELL YOU."") Those ""that I can tell you"" add-ons are almost a nervous tic for him (as well as providing conclusive evidence that he and the made up publicist from the 80s ""John Miller"" are one in the same, as they used that same phrase.I know it is ironclad accepted conventional wisdom that Donald is a great showman. Maybe he was once, before he began his run for commander in chief. But now, he is a tired cliché of insults and egomania. And he is boring. Like the drunk at the end of the bar, he's amusing -- for awhile. He shouts out insulting nicknames to his barmates -- ""Hey dummy! Hey ugly! Hey little Marco!"" At first we laugh. But very soon, we turn to each other and say, ""That's all he's got,"" and we move to another part of the bar.It's always interesting to see what emerges as the unassailable quality of a candidate. Hillary may be secretive and a little paranoid, but she sure is smart. George W. Bush may not be that bright and lacks foreign policy experience, but he sure is likable. Donald Trump may be a racist and misogynist, but he is a great showman.Nope. He isn't a great showman. He's a crashing bore.I had the privilege, if that's the word, to watch Chris Christie up close for awhile. The rap on him was, well, he's rude and a bully, but he sure knows how to work the crowds. And that became the ""book"" on Christie. He knew how to work the crowds.Except he didn't. If you watched ""the crowds"" when Christie held town hall meetings or wandered out to meet voters, as I did dozens of times, the crowds were as much unimpressed with him as they were charmed. But the label stuck, and as Christie wandered around New Hampshire early this primary season, commentators spoke that it was a perfect state for him because he could practice ""retail politics"" and, yes. charm the voters.He came in 6th, and won zero delegates.If commentators think a bit more than they have and begin to question the premise that, no matter what other vile qualities Trump has, he is a great entertainer, there might be a real shift in how voters perceive the overblown court jester from 5th Avenue.What makes someone who can't think on his feet except to hurl personal insults a ""great entertainer""? Who is this ""great showman"" who can't stop talking about himself and whose press conferences are endless? Because he brings his own brand of steaks to a press conference, that's showmanship? Really?I concede I am in a minority. Although I find the guy dangerous and stupid and unable to show interest in anything beyond himself, I also think he is flat out dull. When the stand-up comic never changes his material, we lose interest. If Arnold Schwarzenegger played the same role over and over ... okay, bad example.Trump is a repetitive bore. We can only hope the media catch on to this and point it out before the election (unlikely since they benefit from his shopworn routine) and that his followers realize he is just a dreary cartoon (even more unlikely.)But once we begin to call Trump boring and dull, he won't be able to stand it. It will be the one thing that will rattle him. And remember, on one of his insult tears against Barack Obama, Trump said that in business, rattling someone is a good thing.If we can rattle Trump by pointing put his dullness, it will be a very good thing.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Yet only a relative few have had a hand in shaping the kind of person I am, my late parents and my three siblings among them.And Muhammad Ali.Ali's death Friday night has dimmed the light in the universe a little. I hope it was for him a gentle end to years of courageous, graceful struggle against disease, even as it concluded his faithful work for peace and a purpose greater than any one of us.I'm saddened, of course, and inevitably thinking about his impact on my life and about the two fleeting encounters we had that were so momentous to me.Ali's personal pursuit of fair treatment under the law began about two years before mine. With the Vietnam War raging and young men subject to a mandatory military draft, Ali and I both sought official designation as conscientious objectors to war and killing. Federal law explicitly provided exemptions from military service for those who met the category's qualifications. In September 1968, when I applied to my suburban St. Louis draft board for C-O status (technically, 1-O), I was a 20-year-old white kid starting his senior year in college. I had no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.When Ali requested, in February 1966, that his Louisville draft board grant him C-O status, he was an irrepressible, 24-year-old black man and the heavyweight champion of the world.Ali drew his objections from the teachings of Islam and its holy book, the Quran, as interpreted and practiced by the controversial Chicago-based Nation of Islam. The group also advocated racial separation and black superiority, and its leaders often spewed hateful rhetoric that included anti-Semitic diatribes. (Ali left the Nation of Islam in the mid-1970s and embraced Sunni Islam.)My objections were rooted in the example of my father's personal non-violence (he served with distinction in an Army medical unit during World War II); the teachings of my faith, Judaism; and personal beliefs and values that had begun to take shape during my high school years and in college at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.With guidance from the Jewish Peace Fellowship and other groups, I fortified my application to the draft board with excerpts from the Torah, the Talmud, and the prophets and with letters of support from rabbis and my college professors of religion and philosophy. Ali was publicly vilified. His religious beliefs were demeaned. He refused military induction on principle and was indicted, convicted, fined, and sentenced to prison. He lost legal appeals for more than five years before being vindicated at the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 1971. The struggle cost him millions of dollars in legal fees and boxing income he couldn't earn because sports authorities wouldn't let him compete. My case was over in less than a year. There were no court proceedings and no legal setbacks. It cost me virtually nothing. I was demeaned only once: During a 15-minute private hearing, one of the draft board members mocked my claims. In July 1969, the board granted my application for C-O status.I had seen Muhammad Ali in person for the first time just two months earlier. He was fighting in Washington, but not in a boxing ring. He was on stage at GWU's Lisner Auditorium, a stop on his three-year college speaking tour.Ali was taking his battle with the government to campus communities as opposition to the Vietnam War grew and as the specter of the draft loomed ever larger. I saw him at Lisner on May 5, 1969, a month before I graduated.Ali's presentation included some of the Nation of Islam's dreary race-separation talking points (without anti-Semitic slurs), but when he turned to war, peace, and the law, his arguments -- amplified by the irresistible force of his personality -- electrified the crowd, me included.The sheer power of his presence and seeing and hearing him talk about his quest for justice -- the end of which was very much in doubt when mine began -- made me see the obstacles in my path more sharply and intensify my focus on how to overcome them.Ali's refusal to betray his religious beliefs and his determination in the face of the powerful political, social, and legal forces marshaled against him gave me strength. The logic, humor, and anger he directed at ignorant institutions that insulted his faith and nullified his championship inspired me. And I took great heart from Ali's willingness to risk his freedom by insisting that his government treat him fairly.The last time I saw Ali was on March 20, 1992, at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the newspaper where I worked at the time. He had come to my hometown to attend a Leon Spinks fight and to promote a business deal with Sprint that benefited the Muhammad Ali Foundation.He was being interviewed by a reporter and an editor, and I tried to monitor their progress from across the newsroom. I hoped to grab a moment with him afterward, but I got pulled away. So I didn't hear the burst of applause that greeted him when he emerged from the conference room, and I didn't see him exit the fifth-floor newsroom. Told that Ali had just left, I flew down five flights of stairs and ran out of the lobby onto the street where a limousine was parked at the curb, motor running.I knocked on a darkened side window and pulled the door open. Ali, alone in the back seat, looked over at me. Breathless and nervous, I ducked my head into the car, extended my right hand and said, as best I recall, ""Champ, I just wanted to say how much I admire you and what an inspiration you've been to me.""Ali looked puzzled. In a voice almost too soft and slow to hear, he said, ""You're tired of me?"" ""No, no, no!"" I said, panicking, repeating what I'd said, explaining how much I respected him, apologizing ...And then, in an instant, his face softened. He smiled. He extended his hand, took hold of mine and held it warmly. He had only pretended to have mis-heard. Ali had played a trick on me, something he took delight in doing to people whenever an opportunity arose. I took a breath, smiled back at him, thanked him again and closed the limo door.We had completed a circle.Parts of this column originally were published by the St. Louis Jewish Light."

The political weirdness.That the media would swoop down on her after she came out, and make her a de facto spokesperson for the trans ""community,"" was as inevitable as the ugly backlash that blitzed her. How positive the media attention has been is another question. Her photo shoots last year for Vanity Fair and Glamour, for example, while on one level a celebration of trans women as women, have in their evocations of conventional female glamour also reinforced the old transphobic stereotype of us as just ""sissy"" men playing a freakish, pathetic game of dress-up. It's an impression that neither Jenner's conventionally ""male"" voice and mien nor the recent false rumors that she's considering ""de-transitioning"" will do much to counteract.Her reality TV show, I Am Cait, was going to be an important vehicle for countering such stereotypes by spreading awareness of the trans condition. The show has probably accomplished at least a little of that goal, in particular (for those who were still watching) in its recently aired second season, for which a group of iconic and/or influential trans ""gal pals"" were assembled around her. But the artificiality of the context for the group's interactions -- a ""road trip"" in a customized bus -- not to mention of the ""reality"" TV format itself, has doubtless undermined at least some of the series' positive impact by again suggesting the unreality of the trans condition.And then there are Jenner's politics.Her vocal allegiance to the Republican Party is problematic, certainly, given the majority of the party's ongoing hostility to people like us -- as gal pal Jennifer Boylan repeatedly pointed out to her over the course of I Am Cait's second season. Particularly troublesome have been Jenner's parroting of the party's hostile dogma on issues directly impacting so many of our lives like welfare, and -- the real WTF? head-scratcher -- her professed admiration for former presidential candidate and miserable SOB Ted Cruz. Justifying this bizarre preference by praising the junior senator from Texas for being ""a great constitutionalist and a very articulate man,"" Jenner -- in case you missed it -- went so far as to express an interest in being his trans ""ambassador"" should he become president. All this while acknowledging that he was ""probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues.""Um, YEAH.I have no desire to defend Jenner's Cruzophilia or any of her other absurdities (Donald Drumpf ""would be very good for women's issues""???). Yet I find myself even now wanting to empathize with this woman who has so often put her foot in it, and to continue embracing her presence in our ranks for the good it's doing us even if that good has a liberal admixture of bad and ugly. Indeed, in her case bad, ugly, and good have so often been inextricable from and even dependent on each other.The source of my empathy for Jenner is the simple fact that she's struggling like the rest of us to come to terms with her identity. Sure, her wealth and celebrity status have cushioned her from much of the shit that a lot of us have to deal with, and have made easily accessible to her things most of us either struggle for or only dream about (oh to have gobs of money to sink into electrolysis!). But coming out in the public eye poses its own challenges. Transitioning is an intense, often profoundly painful experience under the best of circumstances. I remember how vulnerable I felt, emotionally as well as physically, during the first couple of years after I came out, and how thankful I was that my online job enabled me to hide away in my apartment on those days when I didn't feel equal to bearing up under the hostile gazes of others -- a luxury less readily accessible to her. Those of us who come out later in life, moreover, face the added difficulty of reconciling the years that have passed with the self we're belatedly embracing. For Jenner, that challenge is magnified tenfold by her decades-old high profile public persona and complicated, largely public personal life. We can question her judgment in undertaking this difficult journey in the spotlight; but given her status, the choice was never going to be fully hers to make.As for the good Jenner's time in the spotlight has done, there's the obvious point that her celebrity status has drawn more attention to trans issues, nor have I relinquished my faith that it will over time help convince more and more skeptics that being trans is a real thing. There's also the fact that her high-profile presence in the Republican ranks has rankled many right-wing bigots. And if her gaffes as spokesperson are legion, I'm willing to accept as sincere (if somewhat disingenuous) her frequent avowals that her newness to being an out trans woman disqualifies her for the role, and to credit her willingness to amend her positions and to attempt to wield her influence as the nation's highest profile trans woman positively. Though an old saying has them paving the road to hell, good intentions surely count for something. In the main, however, Jenner's advocacy has borne fruits in spite of, or aside from, rather than because of her efforts.In a provocative article for Think Progress, for example, Zack Ford attributes to Jenner's ignorance, rather than her celebrity, whatever success I Am Cait has had in changing minds and hearts. Her ""naïve[té] to the struggles many transgender people have had to endure,"" Ford argues, makes her ""a proxy for the audience,"" who are learning along with her. As such, he claims, her role in our move into the mainstream is that of ""anti-hero"" rather than hero.Jenner's political views also have an unintended positive effect: as National Center for Transgender Equity executive director Mara Keisling points out, they highlight our diversity. Trans folks come from all ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and hold a range of views on all manner of things, including politics. Being perceived as a diverse group is, I think, vital for us to achieve widespread acceptance outside LGBTQ circles, for it will help others see that we're not a monolithic fringe minority reducible to our dysphoria and suicide attempts, but rather, in the end, just like everyone else in the ways that matter.Even Jenner's conventionally ""male"" voice and mien have the inadvertent upside of focusing attention on one of the biggest barriers to our acceptance: the fact that we often don't pass perfectly. For us to be accorded our full humanity, people must change how they read the visual and aural signals associated with gender. The premium placed on passing must give way to a willingness to distinguish between the outer markers and the inner reality, to accept that, say, someone who might look and/or sound to them like a man has a brain that's wired female, and should be treated as such if she requests it. Ultimately, we must surrender our genital fundamentalism and embrace gender as the fluid, richly diverse realm of human experience that it is. Because this change in perspective entails undoing centuries of ""common sense"" thinking, its realization will doubtless continue to meet with substantial resistance for some time to come. The issue needs forcing, then; and in the way she speaks and carries herself at present, Jenner forces it to a degree that others in the spotlight (Laverne Cox, Lana Wachowski, certainly Janet Mock) do not.There's a poetic irony here, given Jenner's own stated views on passing. In an interview for Time magazine last December, she observed that she takes her presentation seriously because ""if you're out there and...you look like a man in a dress, it makes people uncomfortable."" It was yet another thoughtless gaffe for which she was roundly (and rightly) chastised, and for which she offered a swift apology and clarification. But this little episode, and the infuriating muddle of our celebrity fellow traveler's advocacy that it epitomizes, also hold a lesson we would do well to bear in mind: that our push for equal rights and full recognition is going to be as messy as the democratic process itself."
32,TRAVEL,Do Not Cancel Your Trip to Paris!,"Sidonie Sawyer, ContributorBorn in France, immigrated to the USA / Features and Travel Wr...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/do-not-cancel-your-trip-t_b_10303086.html,,2016-06-05,2016-06-05-1465093468-4644363-7362JARDINDUPETITPALAIS.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-05-1465093468-4644363-7362JARDINDUPETITPALAIS-thumb.jpg,"No, the city is not on lockdown. After the recent dramatic flooding by the expanding river Seine, visitors will be happy to return to the capital where summers are mostly dry. Today, the water is already receding - in any case, affected areas were mostly alongside the river. Paris is shaped as a snail (escargot in French). Look at a map of the city from above, and you will see that the 20 parts of Paris - the arrondissements - are unfolding from the very center to the outside rim of town in a circular clockwise way. No arrondissement is better than the others, but they each do have specific attractions that you may want to know about before visiting.Numbered from one to 20, the metropolis districts unroll from le premier arrondissement (the 1st), to its last tail part, the 20ième arrondissement (the 20th). Each arrondissement has more than one or two interesting points, but I picked here some of my favorites. Six arrondissements are located on the Left Bank of the Seine (Rive Gauche), the other 14 are on the Right Bank (Rive Droite). Yes, the traffic in Paris goes at snail pace, so better take the subway (le métro) to visit with less stress. The 1st: This is the heart of the city, and I mean the geometrical center, not necessarily the most vibrant. This is where the majestic Musée du Louvre and its grand pyramid entrance welcome art lovers. The adjoining Tuileries gardens are a favorite of little Parisians. Métro stop Louvre.The 2nd: The smallest of them all, at 245 acres. Where many of Paris covered passages are located, nice indoor walks for unique shopping experience when the elements are not participating. Métro Bourse.The 3rd: Beaubourg Centre Pompidou. The modern art museum still spelling controversy thanks to its unique architecture, several floors of art and then, that escalator! Best views of Paris rooftops. Métro Beaubourg.The 4th: Musée Picasso. And the Place des Vosges - the oldest town square of Paris, and the Marais, a chic and quiet enclave. And don't forget Notre Dame and the Ile de la Cité. Métro Saint Paul.  The 5th: The infamous center of the 1968 students' revolution, it has kept the hippie feel and relaxed atmosphere of young students and lingering extremism. Nicknamed the Latin Quarter. Planted in 1601, this is where the oldest tree of the city majestically rest in the center of Square Viviani. Métro Saint Michel.The 6th: Luxembourg gardens. Magnificent former royal green gardens, this is where the original model of the Statue of Liberty stands erected. Métro Luxembourg.  The 7th: Tour Eiffel - enough said, and the Musée du Quai Branly, featuring indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, in a funky line-up of earth colors boxes. Métro Pont de l'Alma.The 8th: Champs-Elysées/ Concorde/Arc de Triomphe = all nice spots to visit. Plus the amazing Petit Palais and its grandiose outdoor café. Métro Champs-Elysées-Clémenceau.The 9th: Opéra Palais Garnier. Gold studded architectural masterpiece, for fans of arias. Also, all the large department stores of Paris are located here. Métro Opéra.The 10th: Canal Saint Martin. Detailed iron footbridges and tree-shaded quays form a unique backdrop to some of the best foodies joints in the capital. A leisure walk along the waterway is enough to make you think you left the city for a weekend trip. Métro Louis Blanc.The 11th: Cornered by Place de la Bastille, Place de la République, and the Père Lachaise cemetery, the area is home to the Edith Piaf museum (by appointment only), the Bastille column centerpiece and the opera house, and one of the best brasserie of Paris, Bofinger. Métro stops: Bastille, République, Voltaire.The 12th: Giant columns frame the avenue where my favorite open air market takes place at the roundabout Place de la Nation on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Métro Nation.The 13th: This is where the small Chinatown part of Paris is - clothing stores and groceries, plus some authentic restaurants, frequented by an Asian crowd, always a good sign. Métro Place d'Italie.The 14th: Where the controversial 58-floor tower sits un-pretty on top of a train station, the Montparnasse neighborhood is home to several movie theaters and the best crèpes restaurants in the city. It also has a very nice old-fashion cemetery, with its population of feral cats. Jean-Paul Sartre, a resident of the district, is buried there. Métro Montparnasse.The 15th: The lovely Parc André Citroën, built on the former car factory site, is designed with six themed gardens each associated with a different metal, a planet, a day of the week, a state of the water, and a sense. Also here, the Pont de Bir-Hakeim straddles the Seine and offers the best view of the Eiffel Tower from the subway cars, which is aerial at that point. The steel bridge has two levels, one for cars and walkers, the higher one for the Line #6 of the métro. Métro stops: Bir-Hakeim and Balard.The 16th: With its ornate 19th-century buildings, wide avenues, and prestigious schools, this arrondissement has been called a ritzy area, and is often associated with wealth in popular culture. This is where the Bois de Boulogne and the Jardin d'Acclimation are located, also hosting the new edgy Louis Vuitton foundation art museum, a must-see. Métro Les Sablons and Ranelagh.The 17th: Place Clichy is the heart of the district, with movie theaters, hot and sexy night joints, and the best fabric and discount clothing anywhere in the city. Home to the Square des Batignolles, a four-acre green space designed in English-garden style. Métro Place Clichy or La Fourche.The 18th: Montmartre. With its fun funicular, Sacré Coeur basilica, vineyards, and street artists, plus the magnificent views of the city below, it's a very popular area with tourists (hint: always busy). I like the steep hills and cobbled streets. Métro Abbesses.The 19th: The Buttes-Chaumont gardens. High up on a hill, one of the best viewpoints of the city. With grotto, cascade, pebbles trails, meandering river, ducks and green lawn, this flower garden is one of my favorite nature park of Paris. Métro Buttes Chaumont.The 20th: Ménilmontant and Belleville, two neighborhood of real immigration flavor, with North Africa dishes such as couscous and méchoui at street stands everywhere, cheap clothes and friendly faces drinking green tea in tiny glasses at outside terraces. Also home to the Père Lachaise cemetery, eternal home of Jim Morrison. Métro Père Lachaise.  No matter where you find yourself, there will always be a boulangerie (bakery) at every corner. I was born in the 18th, lived in the 1st, 8th, 14th, 17th, 19th, and 20th. And just like other major cities, certain zip codes are trendier than others, with real estate value sometimes going bonkers from one district to the next. Under the Romans, Lutetia had a population of about 8,000 and was re-baptized Paris in 360 A.D. Today the population of the city is 2, 4 million residents (2014 census), a strangely lower number than in 1921 when it was almost 3 million.

France was disrupted by a third straight day of strikes and demonstrations on May 19 as the prime minister called for protesters who torched a police car to face 'harsh' punishment. The labour reforms have sparked two months of protests on France's streets. / AFP / PASCAL PAVANI (Photo credit should read PASCAL PAVANI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d97e2d280000ee376ff43f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Translator's note: Since the end of March France has been roiled by protests over the Socialist government's proposals to loosen France's famously rigid labor laws. The Nuit Debout movement, modeled on Occupy Wall Street and anti-austerity movements in Spain and elsewhere, began with nightly assemblies in the Place de la République in Paris. With some of France's labor unions joining in, the protests have since spread around the country and increased in intensity. Blockades of oil refineries have caused fuel shortages. On May 26, the secretary-general of one France's largest labor federations, the CGT, called a flash strike against the country's daily newspapers for refusing to print a communiqué from him. Did Philippe Martinez overstep? Popular sentiment in France appears to have turned against him and the protesters. Will he soon be as unpopular as France's president, François Hollande? On June 10, the Euro 2015 soccer tournament begins in France, floods permitting. Three days later, the French senate takes up the labor reform bill passed by the lower house in May. On June 14, protesters have promised another day of protests. * * *Philippe Martinez is the French syndicalist with the hang-dog look, the expression of infinite sadness that belligerent pronouncements and caustic talking points enliven not one bit. He has a way, a way both macho and a little pathetic, of overplaying his hand with the government, declaring that he will never back down, that he will go to the brink, that he will make France yield and, if necessary, bring the country ""to its knees."" Over and over we hear from the sidelines of marches in which fires, tear gas and warning shots have replaced the chants and slogans of the workers of yesteryear, Martinez's defiant words about ""police brutality,"" about ""employers' violence,"" and about his own intent to alter, unassisted, and like one of the greats, the ""balance of power"" between the CGT and a treacherous left that supposedly has turned betrayal into a tool of government and of survival. The most striking aspect of all this is the spectacle that the CGT, once so powerful and so self-possessed, is making of itself. The spectacle of this organization, whose security units, which were the pride of the militant world, prevented any and all deviations from the script during demonstrations, suddenly no longer having either the authority or the will to contain a new generation of wreckers. The sad realization that this anemic body hooked up to a glucose drip moans and groans so loudly because it no longer has a hold on anything; that it would be not near so radical in word and symbol if it were not aware of having lost in the only realm that really counts: that of the world of work. Far away indeed are the ghosts of Georges Séguy and Henri Krasucki! Long gone the glory days of the battle over Renault and the concessions wrenched from Pierre Dreyfus! Dim, nearly erased, the extraordinary emanations of civilized intelligence that were the great labor negotiations of the last century. The most striking thing, and the saddest, is the soulless pack led by its CGT boss, a pack that is now only the shadow of the rallies, the mass assemblies, the intermingling of revolutionary groups, the Sartrian fraternities, and the Mallarmean crowds spreading like wings taking flight--the shadow, in short, of The People, who instilled passion in the young minds of the 1960s before just as suddenly quenching them. For people there were.Forged in the crucibles of the blast-furnaces, on the assembly lines, in the groans of the industrial machine, and in the struggles to break free from it, there was that which became known as The People.There was, from Dickens to Tolstoy, from Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin to How Green Was My Valley -- there was, in France, from Robespierre to Michelet, from Lamartine to Hugo, that fragile yet colossal being: The People was neither the Latin throng (turba) nor the Athenian beast. It was not that gaping mass, dehumanized by the machine, in which human beings drowned. Still less was it the protest that became a pack running riot along Paris's Boulevard Diderot, a pack aping the proletarian act against a backdrop of mindless slogans and to the sounds of destruction of the urban landscape. That People stumbled.It went astray; lost its way.It abandoned itself to immense and terrible idols: to the political idol, when it saw itself as a nation; to the communist idol, when it imagined itself internationally, as a human race without borders; and to the religious idol, of course, under the name and in the guise of churches. But it once existed.And occasionally it achieved greatness.There was greatness, there was power of mind and thought, in the mystery of the communion of men and women around a language, around a task or quest, and even around a piece of territory that some of them decided to occupy together, drawing inspiration from lovely phrases full of the general will and democratic yearning. Unfortunately, all that seems dead. That is the meaning of the fifteen minutes of Warholian fame that Mr. Martinez is now enjoying.Nothing in that seeming death, nothing about the anemic CGT and its hollow show of strength, nothing about this leftist front caricatured by a playground tribune, nothing about a leftism become synonymous with nihilism (though not the nihilism of the philosophers or even that of Nechayev; the nihilism instead of three-time losers and repeat offenders trying to cheat not death but boredom and the awareness of their own insignificance -- none of this is cause for exultation. The disappearance of a people is never good news.Today, indeed, it is probably one of the worst pieces of news that we face. And it is not an occasion on which we can ask the band to strike up some new ""Multinationale"" (the lyrics remain unwritten) in place of the old ""Internationale,"" which is now defunct and, worse, has been travestied -- because the ongoing travesty of The People that has convened on the periphery of the great contemporary spectacle signifies nothing other than an admission that meaning has been lost, dissolved in the wasteland of ignorance, in the swelling of that half-dead, half-living matter that proliferates when bodies decompose, which Polybius, the greatest of the Greek historians, could not decide whether to burn or to drown. How does one revive a people?I do not know, but one thing is sure: the silence of minds and the subjugation of consciences will certainly have the opposite effect. Translated from French by Steven B.

They aren't comparing apples to apples. Frankly, it's hard to say what they are comparing.Every restaurant in every city and town in Panama is 35 percent more expensive than every restaurant in every city and town in the United States?That can't be what the reader meant...I don't doubt that you could buy an apartment in Nashville (or in many other cities across the United States) for the same cost per square foot or less than you'd spend for an apartment on Ambergris Caye.Of course, Ambergris is a Caribbean island boasting long white-sand beaches and the best snorkeling and diving in the world. An apartment in Nashville doesn't seem to compare, does it?Or maybe it does. It depends on what's important to you.If you want to live near the ocean, you're going to spend more per square foot for your place of residence than you would for an apartment in any random land-locked city.If living near the ocean isn't important to you, then you don't have to concern yourself with beachfront pricing.One couple recently visited Panama, stopped in a couple of grocery stores, and checked prices at the pumps. Their conclusion? Food and gas prices in this country are ""much higher than back home.""Maybe some specific grocery items are more expensive than the same foods in this couple's home town. But, again, you've got to compare apples to apples. Processed foods imported from the States are going to cost more anywhere. If you want them, you're going to have to pay the price.However, shop not at the U.S.-style grocery stores but at the local markets, and your apples, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, peppers, corn, rice, and locally raised beef and chicken will cost you less than they do back home. I'd bet on it.Is the price of gas higher in Panama than in the States? Depends where in the States you're comparing to and what kind of gas you're buying. We could compare figures for a gallon of 91 octane in Panama City with those for a gallon of 91 octane in Dallas, Texas, Baltimore, Maryland, or San Diego, California.But, frankly, that seems a bit tedious. And it misses the point.Are you going to base your retire-overseas decision on the cost of a gallon of 91 octane gasoline?I hope not.Depending where you're moving from and where you decide to move to, some things are going to cost less (maybe dramatically less), and some things are going to cost more. You've got to consider overall costs of living and not be distracted by the cost of a loaf of bread.In other words, compare not only apples to apples, but baskets of costs to comparable baskets of costs.Back home you're likely paying hefty annual property taxes ... maybe US$10,000 per year or more depending on state of residence. In many countries, you won't have to pay property taxes at all. In others that impose property taxes (including France, Colombia, and Belize, for example), they're negligible.Back home you likely don't have a maid or a gardener. If you do, the help is likely part-time and expensive. In some parts of Central America, you could have full-time help around the house for as little as US$150 a month.If your only goal in retirement is to live cheap, you could probably save yourself the trouble of relocating to another country and seek out, instead, a super-low-cost locale Stateside. Living a modest lifestyle in a small town in Alabama or Iowa, for example, you could maybe do OK on your Social Security income.However, you can't compare modest, small-town life in middle America with beachfront living on a Caribbean island ... a new life in a centuries-old Colonial city ... an expansive view of the crashing Pacific from your balcony ... or discovering the charms and historic traditions of country life on the Continent...This isn't only about the money.Keep in mind how much more affordable your life could be living in certain places overseas. This isn't hype. It's fact.It's also relative. The particulars depend on where you're coming from, where you're moving to, and how you intend to live.I hope, though, that we do as good a job helping you recognize the other benefits of investing in a new life in a new country.I can't tell you where you should go (though I'm happy to continue to make suggestions). I can't tell you how much more affordable your life is going to be once you get there (one more time, this will depend on where and how you want to live).But I can tell you that boiling this adventure down to a line-item comparison of costs for things like cable television and a pound of ground beef is a mistake. And basing your decision to move (or not) on that kind of thinking is doing yourself a disservice.It won't always be easy, but you've got to keep the big picture in mind.Moving to another country, at any point in your life, would be the adventure of your lifetime.Start with that. And stay the course.Related Articles: The Cost Of Living In Nicaragua: A Top Retirement And Vacation Hotspot Living In Europe On A Budget Just Got EasierCorozal On A Budget--How This Single Pensioner Moved To Belize And Began Her New Affordable Life In ParadiseEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

The World Health Organization (WHO) says there were some 35 million people around the world living with HIV by the end of 2013, with some 2.1 million new infections during the course of that year. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region, with almost 70 percent of new infections. AFP PHOTO/MARCO LONGARI / AFP / MARCO LONGARI (Photo credit should read MARCO LONGARI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc0d56c240000330037370b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the United Nations convenes this week for its High Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, the corridors will be buzzing with talk of ""the end of AIDS."" UNAIDS tells us that it will happen provided key testing and treatment targets, including doubling the number of people on antiretroviral treatment, are achieved within four years. UNAIDS and major funders have determined that a ""fast-track"" strategy -- focusing on a subset of countries with highest transmission -- is the best way to reach these goals. While a renewed ambition to quickly curtail one of the deadliest pandemics in history is laudable, the global health community risks significant treatment gaps and continued HIV transmission if the focus is only on highest transmission countries. The global health community simply cannot afford to ignore the HIV epidemic in Western and Central Africa (WCA), where five million, or a third, of the 15 million people who should be started on antiretrovirals in the next four years currently live. WCA countries account for one in five new HIV infections worldwide and a third of the 1.2 million AIDS-related deaths a year. The reason: only one in four people who need antiretroviral treatment have access to it. The strategy to end AIDS should aim to roll out antiretrovirals to all, particularly where treatment gaps are the largest. However, UNAIDS, PEPFAR, the Global Fund and others aim to instead sharpen their focus on so-called ""hot spots,"" high prevalence areas or most-at-risk groups. The alignment of these strategies may lead to rationing of lifesaving interventions, meaning that the global goals cannot be achieved because it leaves the virus' deadly spree unchecked, outdoing progress elsewhere. Populations wrongly perceived to be of marginal interest for epidemic control cannot once again be left behind. We know that treatment saves live AND prevents new infections, and that expanded access to ARVs is the best way to bring the epidemic under control. This is most dramatically illustrated by a chilling statistic from this region: each year 45 percent of all infants infected around birth are from WCA. These new infections are almost completely preventable when mothers have access to antiretrovirals during pregnancy and soon after birth. Despite these glaring needs, WCA remains out of focus internationally, mostly because of its relatively low average prevalence of 2.3 percent (still three times the global average), and dearth of alternative actors that can provide the full package of HIV prevention and treatment interventions. Countries with lower prevalence or smaller populations do not score high on the priority list and, as a result, suffer disproportionately from HIV/AIDS. In 2004, when antiretroviral started to become accessible in the most affected regions in the South and East of Africa, 25 percent of HIV-related deaths were occurring in West and Central Africa. Twelve years later, as the ART programs in high prevalence countries have dramatically expanded, mortality there has dropped. Not so in WCA, which now accounts for 36 percent of all HIV-related deaths on the continent. It is difficult to foresee a reversal of this trend without strong action taken in these regions left behind.Doctors Without Borders witnesses daily the human toll of the continued neglect of people living with HIV in the region. In our specialized AIDS hospital in Kinshasa, patients are admitted in advanced stages of AIDS that have become relatively rare since the mid-2000s even in the most affected countries. One in four of our Kinshasa patients are so severely ill from AIDS that they cannot be saved. In the Central African Republic, where HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death amongst adults, MSF-supported hospitals see very high number of AIDS patients, a situation reminiscent of the nineties in other countries. In these hospitals one in four in-patients suffer from AIDS-related illnesses and over four in five of all deaths are due to HIV/AIDS. Let's be frank: the challenge of scaling up antiretroviral treatment in WCA is huge. But the challenge was no less huge 16 years ago, when the world decided to mobilize to make access to ARVs a reality for all. Through the creation of PEPFAR and the Global Fund a chance at life on ART was created for people living with HIV in countries most affected by AIDS. This decision broke the deadly circle of HIV deaths and suffering and brought most high prevalence countries closer to the ""tipping point"" for epidemic control, where the number of people initiated on antiretroviral surpassed the number of new infections. This point is still far off in WCA. Leaving things at the current status quo would be a strategic mistake. The stated goal of curtailing the pandemic worldwide would fail. What allowed success in many of the most affected countries was the embrace of major changes in strategies and models of care, such as task shifting, strict no-payment policies for patients, patient literacy and autonomy, de-medicalized and community based ARV refills and a key role for patient associations and civil society organizations in stigma reduction, service delivery, advocacy and outcome monitoring. Unfortunately, many of the lessons learned remain largely unapplied in WCA today, with some pilot experiences in the region as positive but lonely exceptions. For this reason, MSF is calling for an ambitious catch-up plan for countries with low antiretroviral coverage such as most of those in West and Central Africa. People's right to lifesaving ARVs should not be curtailed based on who they are, where they live or the specific characteristics of the HIV epidemic they face. If the world is serious in its goal of defeating AIDS, it is time to bring in the cavalry with the necessary resources to seriously tackle HIV and bring lifesaving ARV to some of its weakest and most neglected victims. This will not be possible without the commitment of powerful international donors and organizations. The people left behind by the HIV revolution over the past decade should not be forgotten once again. The crucial next four years may be their last chance to benefit from what the world has learned from the successful mobilization against HIV. We should, and can, care for the most vulnerable, for their sake and for the sake of curbing the epidemic."

No joke. (Well, it has to be something of a joke when you reference him, but I am serious about this.) Mark the day - Friday, June 17. I have arbitrarily picked that as NUT Day - ""No Utterance of Trump"" Day. That gives social media time enough to spread the word and is close enough that I may just be able to hold it together until then...A therapist I know (OK, you got me - my therapist) says she's noticed a noticeable uptick of late in patients complaining of a Trump fixation. They say they are obsessed with him. They say they are riddled with anxiety, catastrophizing (one of my favorite words and one of my least favorite afflictions,) and finding every conversation gravitating towards Trump like one of the Millennium Falcons in the grip of the Death Star's tractor beam. References to the late days of the Weimar Republic are catching up with us all. We may not be able to recruit the Legion of Lemmings - the GOP, the NRA, and the KKK - but that leaves plenty to work with. Get on it! You know you need it as much as I do. Besides, there is plenty of historical precedence for such a movement. Classical history and literature are rich with names that could not be spoken. Who could forget the Three Stooges (funny how they come to mind thinking of Trump) and how the mere mention of ""Niagara Falls"" by Curly triggered a violent reaction in Moe - ""Slowly I turn...step by step..."" Then there's Harry Potter and his ilk who had He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, referencing the dark Lord Voldemort. And other historical references far too numerous to mention. (I am learning from Trump how to turn ignorance into evidence.) I am not wedded to the name - ""No Utterance of Trump."" I could live with ""National Sanity Day,"" or maybe ""Enough Fruitcake Day."" I don't really care what we call it, I just know that enduring endless days of marinating in Trump Mania is bad for the nation's psyche - and mine.  You psychologists out there- you specialists in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT - (Clear the Brain of Trump) - I appeal to you to weigh in and help us reframe our thoughts on this very special day, when we may escape the chants of ""Make America Great Again,"" and all the grainy footage of the Nuremberg Rallies that run in our minds, and help us remember a time when a not-so-great-America used phrases like ""Give us your tired, your poor."" Could we not spend the day reading Good Republicans like Lincoln - ""I do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday"" - or Dwight D. Eisenhower, who, in helping to save the world, accomplished nearly as much as Trump - ""Any man who wants to be president is either an egomaniac or crazy."" (He can be forgiven for the use of ""either,"" never having met Mr. Trump.) I feel pretty comfortable in saying that both Lincoln and Eisenhower would have supported a day free of the man. Yes, it's just a day but hopefully, in the aftermath of the election, no such declaration will be needed. In that case this will all just be good practice for living in a world where deep pockets, loose marbles and big mouths are not mistaken for presidential stock. And if I am wrong, and it's Donald's hand on the Bible next January, (horribile dictu) well I'm guessing Prozac sales will go through the roof, the passport office will be overwhelmed, and our allies and enemies will be all forgiveness and forging new alliances in the hope of surviving the incoming fusillade of ego and willful ignorance. So one day, that's all I ask. One day free of him, one day when everything is not upside down, when humility is again seen as a virtue, and when our coins will be stamped ""e pluribus unum,"" not ""every (white) man for himself."" How about it?"
