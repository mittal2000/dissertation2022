In fact, all he needed to do was shave. The ""American Hustle"" actor was hardly recognizable without his signature scruff: Cooper went clean-shaven for his leading role in ""The Elephant Man,"" which opened on Broadway on Thursday. The 39-year-old, who stars as the title character in the play, recently told ""The Today Show"" that the story is what inspired him to become an actor. “It was the reason why I wanted to become an actor, because of David Lynch’s movie,” he told ""Today"" host Matt Lauer. “And then I discovered it was a play, and I did it for my thesis in grad school.”Notably, Cooper doesn't wear makeup or prosthetics to reflect his character's severe deformities. He described his technique of contorting his face to ""Today"" hosts: “For me, it just starts with the breath and then it sort of just happens."""

Dickins then dug into the imbalanced perceptions that labels and artists have of YouTube and services like Spotify.“What’s interesting is that people take things down off Spotify, yet if I search now for Taylor Swift on YouTube, within the space of 30 seconds I can have the whole Taylor Swift [album] streamed,"" Dickins said. ""Some of it is ad-supported, so there is revenue, and some of it’s not."" Dickins continued: “On the one hand, the labels are trumping YouTube as a marketing tool and 10 million views is [hailed] as a marketing stroke of genius. On the other hand, they’re looking at 10 million streams on Spotify and going: ‘That’s X amount of lost sales.’ So I think there is a lopsided effect. For an artist that needs discovering, anyone who has got a real good album, but is very niche, I think streaming is great for them. Taylor Swift probably looks at it and thinks, ‘There is an element of cannibalisation. I am a brand. People know who I am and I want to protect the record sales.’ And that’s fair enough.”Funnily enough, Adele's album ""21"" was kept off of Spotify for almost a year and a half after its release at the beginning of 2011. Adele, like Swift, originally asked Spotify to make her album available for those subscribed to the service.You can read more of Dickins discussion from the conference over at Billboard."

5,POLITICS,American Legion Appoints Its First Female Executive Director,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/verna-jones_n_6123958.html,,2014-11-08,"Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Director Verna Jones speaks during a town hall meeting at American Legion Post 1 on Monday, June 9, 2014, in Phoenix concerning health-care issues at the Phoenix VA facilities. One Veterans Affairs Department health care system in Arizona has been flagged for further review following a nationwide audit of the agency's troubled appointment process, according to a report released Monday. (AP Photo/Ralph Freso)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc90260000300183bcaf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The American Legion has named Verna Jones its new executive director, making her the first woman to lead the veterans organization in its nearly 100-year history.Jones, an attorney and Army veteran who served as a personnel sergeant, stepped into her new role on Nov. 1. Legion spokesman Marty Callaghan said he believed that Jones is the organization's first African-American executive director, but he couldn't confirm it absolutely. Previously, she served as the director of the Legion's veterans affairs and rehabilitation division. ""We're still focused on the [Department of Veterans Affairs], the quality of health care, timeliness, the backlog, benefits -- all the things that we've been focusing on, and the things that veterans need. Access to health care is huge for us,"" Jones said in an interview with The Huffington Post in her new office. Jones became the most animated when asked about sexual assault in the military, an issue that several members of the Legion, including Jones, have testified about before Congress. The organization has said the military needs to have a ""zero tolerance policy"" on the issue.""To those people who may assault people, [we need to] let them know that we're not going to stand for that, and there are some very serious consequences the first time,"" said Jones. ""So we've got to create programs, we've got to create awareness, and we have to be willing to say that military sexual trauma exists. Stop sweeping it under the rug and pretending it's a small thing, because it's not.""There needs to be punishment,"" she added. ""Something punitive needs to happen. If you're in the military and you sexually assault somebody, then you don't need to be in the military anymore.""Jones' ascension is significant at an organization often seen as being composed of older men hanging out in Legion halls around the country. When asked how the Legion is trying to attract the next generation of veterans, Jones said it's a misconception that the group doesn't have a significant number of younger members. She pointed to the fact that many of the employees at the Legion are young veterans, and said just because some Iraq and Afghanistan veterans may not be at every event doesn't mean they're not involved. ""A lot of the younger members, they're working, they have families, they have children,"" said Jones. ""They have to go to soccer games, football games, tutors, they've got kids. All kinds of stuff. ... But they're dues-paying members, they will give us their opinion about things, they love the Legion.""But as the face of the soldier changes, the face of the veteran changes and the face of the Legion has to change,"" she added.Still, the Legion has opposed some of this change. It came out against getting rid of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the federal law that barred gay men and women from serving openly in the military. President Barack Obama signed its repeal in October 2011. “One must ask, ‘What’s the rush?'” said American Legion National Commander Jimmie L. Foster in December 2010. ""And why should this matter of social policy take precedence over the far more critical matter of national security?""When asked what the Legion thinks now of gays and lesbians serving in the military and how the repeal went, Callaghan jumped in and said, ""As long as the Department of Defense opposed it, we did. Now that the Department of Defense is on board, that's something that we accepted.""Jones added that the organization is happy to have lesbian and gay service members as Legionnaires. ""Our criteria is that you must have served in the military for at least one day of wartime service and been discharged under other than dishonorable conditions,"" she said. ""That's always been like that. I wouldn't know of anybody who's been turned away because of those things. The national headquarters would not stand for that.""Want more updates from Amanda?

6,POLITICS,Mitch McConnell's Triumph Strikes Worry In The Hearts Of Campaign Finance Reformers,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campaign-finance-mitch-mcconnell_n_6122180.html,,2014-11-08,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - NOVEMBER 5: Soon to be the Senate Majority Leader of the US Senate after winning the Kentucky Senate race and the GOP winning a majority of seats in the US Senate, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell leaves a press conference with national and local media at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky, Wednesday, November 5, 2014. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell defeated Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes to be the longest serving Senator in Kentucky history. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc8a240000310098f7d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Over the past three years, House Republicans have repeatedly tried, and failed, to bar federal agencies from adopting regulations to govern the campaign finance landscape created by the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision. Now, with their party seizing control of the Senate, that effort to stop new rules may win, too.The Senate will likely be led next year by the primary antagonist to campaign finance reformers, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Over three decades, McConnell has made it a top priority to disrupt and degrade campaign finance regulations. With a firm belief that limits on campaign funds are a direct impediment to the First Amendment right of free speech, he has opposed past reform efforts, including challenging in court the 2002 McCain-Feingold law, the passage of which he once called the worst day in his political career.With McConnell's ascendance and with Republicans increasingly unified in opposition to campaign finance reform, its advocates expect a full-frontal assault on the few areas where they had hoped to enact new rules in the post-Citizens United world.""This has always been Senator McConnell's DNA issue,"" Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer said, ""the issue he seems to care most about.""In an interview with The Huffington Post, Wertheimer, the dean of campaign finance reformers in Washington, predicted in particular that Republicans will seek to defund efforts by the Internal Revenue Service to write new regulations governing the political activity of certain nonprofits.""Our assumption is we're going to have to fight these kinds of battles over the next two years,"" he said.That concern does not come out of the blue. House Republicans attached a rider to appropriations legislation to prevent President Barack Obama from issuing an executive order mandating disclosure of political contributions by federal contractors. The rider was prompted by a conservative website's reporting on a leaked draft of that order. The rider eventually passed a part of appropriations legislation.Those who vocally oppose campaign finance regulations were also instrumental in helping the GOP win back control of the Senate. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent more than $35 million to support Republicans. The Koch brothers' groups reported at least $26 million in spending to the Federal Election Commission, but dished out an additional $50 million-plus on issue ads to support Republicans early in the election cycle.The main object of Wertheimer's concern is a rider aimed at the IRS that House Republicans tried to add to appropriations legislation in 2013 and 2014. The measure would prevent the tax agency from spending any funds on writing or enforcing new rules to rein in political spending by tax-exempt nonprofit groups.In 2013, the IRS admitted to improperly targeting a number of political groups, including those with the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their names. Congressional Republicans insisted this showed that the Obama administration was targeting political opponents. Democrats and campaign finance reformers responded that it was indicative of the IRS' vague and out-of-date rules on how to approve tax-exempt status and judge political and campaign activity.""Now more than ever, we need to send a clear message to the Obama administration that the First Amendment is non-negotiable, and that apologies after an election year are not a sufficient response to what we now know took place at the IRS,"" McConnell said in a speech at the outset of the scandal.After a host of congressional hearings, firings and suspensions, the IRS announced a rulemaking procedure to write new regulations covering both the way it undertakes the approval and review of tax-exempt status and the means by which it judges whether a tax-exempt group has spent an inappropriate amount of time electioneering. This rulemaking was decried by Republican opponents and hailed by Wertheimer, who then dropped a prior lawsuit over the agency's purported lack of enforcement of political activity rules.Republican leaders, including McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), wrote to interim IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, ""It is our view that finalizing this proposed rule would make intimidation and harassment of the administration's political opponents the official policy of the IRS and would allow the Obama administration to use your agency as a partisan tool.""It was during this period that House Republicans pushed the rider that would deny funding to enact these regulations.If Congress moves to block new IRS rules on nonprofits' political spending through a rider or other means, Wertheimer said he will fight it. ""This is open and shut that the [current] regulations do not comply with the law,"" he said. ""If Congress blocks this, we will bring our lawsuit again.""But Wertheimer is not focused only on the fate of potential IRS regulations. Since 2011, Republicans have also introduced legislation and attempted to attach spending-bill riders to gut the ability of other agencies -- including the Federal Communications Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission -- to write rules on campaign funding and spending. Even when the Republican measures didn't pass, the threat was felt.In 2012, House Republicans attached a rider to an appropriations bill to deny the FCC funding to require online disclosure by broadcast TV stations of their political advertising files. That rule was strongly opposed by the National Association of Broadcasters and the Chamber of Commerce. The bill to which the rider was attached did not pass, but Wertheimer warned the rider could come back now.Reform groups have also put pressure on the FCC to require television stations to disclose ""the real sponsor"" of ads put forward by innocuous-sounding groups. The FCC has rejected this idea so far, but the reformers don't want Congress to cut off any future discussion.In 2013, with the SEC under pressure to write political disclosure regulations for publicly traded companies, House Republicans introduced legislation to prevent the commission from spending money to enforce such rules. The SEC has since backed away from issuing those regulations, and Republicans have similarly not pursued related riders.Next year, the House GOP will have a much more powerful ally against campaign finance reform in the Senate. If Republicans go ahead and push these and similar funding restrictions, Wertheimer urges Obama and Senate Democrats to oppose them.""This is an example of where President Obama has to draw the line,"" Wertheimer said. ""He can stop this, but he's going to have to veto bills. He's going to have to decide that this is important enough to veto bills."""
7,POLITICS,The GOP Will Still Have No Openly Gay Members Of Congress,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/openly-gay-republicans-congress_n_6102044.html,,2014-11-08,"California Republican Congressional candidate Carl DeMaio pauses while speaking at his campaign headquarters, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2014, in San Diego. The race for a San Diego congressional seat already was one of the closest and most expensive in the country. In recent weeks, it also has taken a number bizarre twists that have nothing to do with disagreements about health care reform or federal spending. The Republican challenger, former city councilman Carl DeMaio, has been at the center of multiheaded controversy about his campaign. It includes a late-night break-in at his headquarters, a stolen campaign playbook that ended up in the hands of his opponent and sexual harassment accusations made against the candidate by a fired staffer who, like DeMaio, is gay. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6916b5230000cd1a0c24cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The two men hoping to diversify the Republican Party by showing that being gay doesn't necessarily require being a Democrat lost their congressional bids this election cycle, meaning the GOP will still have no openly gay members in Congress. Richard Tisei of Massachusetts and Carl DeMaio of California both lost to their Democratic opponents. Democrat Seth Moulton beat Tisei by almost 14 percentage points. The race between DeMaio and Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) was much tighter, and The Associated Press didn't call the race for Peters until Friday night, three days after the election.Republican Dan Innis, who is openly gay, also ran in New Hampshire's 1st District, but he lost in September to Frank Guinta in the Republican primary.Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues came up in both DeMaio's and Tisei's races. The campaigns often touted the candidates' support for LGBT rights as evidence that they were more moderate than their Democratic opponents were portraying them to be. In early October, DeMaio aired an ad in which he openly touted the fact that he is gay. ""As a proud gay American, I’ve been called a lot of things in my life,"" DeMaio said in the ad. ""But a Tea Party extremist? Nothing could be further from the truth.""Earlier this year, DeMaio's campaign released another ad ad featuring images of the candidate with his partner, Johnathan Hale, at the San Diego LGBT pride parade.But in its final weeks, DeMaio was hounded by sexual harassment allegations from two former staffers. The candidate denied the allegations, saying they are part of a smear campaign. In 2012, Tisei narrowly lost to Rep. John Tierney (D-Mass.) and the two were poised for a rematch this cycle. Tierney, however, lost this year's Democratic primary to Moulton, an Iraq War veteran who was considered to be a tougher competitor for Tisei. In March, Tisei distanced himself from the more conservative wing of his party by boycotting the Massachusetts GOP convention. Tisei was upset the party had adopted a socially conservative platform that did not embrace marriage equality. The National Organization for Marriage, a group that opposes same-sex marriage, spent money to defeat Tisei and recently called on conservatives to support Moulton. Moulton, however, rejected NOM's endorsement.In March, Gregory T. Angelo, president of Log Cabin Republicans, a Republican group that supports gay rights, told The Huffington Post that having an openly gay member in the Republican caucus would be an important step in helping the party evolve. ""Having a gay Republican in Congress who can make the case that you can be a gay individual who is a strong Republican and also a strong conservative in the House of Representatives would shift the GOP messaging on this,"" Angelo said. ""It might change which bills are introduced, and perhaps more importantly, which bills are not introduced, in the 114th Congress.""The Republican Party has had openly gay lawmakers in Congress in the past, but Tisei and DeMaio would have been the first openly gay members of the party to win seats as non-incumbents.A handful of openly gay Democratic candidates also ran in this cycle, including Rep. Mike Michaud of Maine, who lost his bid for governor, Clay Aiken, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in North Carolina's 2nd District, and Rep. Sean Maloney, who was re-elected in New York's 18th District. Currently, six members of Congress, all Democrats, are openly gay or bisexual, and one senator, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), is openly lesbian.Want more updates from Amanda? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth."

Here's Why They Went",Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/foreign-fighters-iraq-syria_n_6116440.html,,2014-11-08,"FILE - This undated file image posted on a militant website on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2014, which has been verified and is consistent with other AP reporting, shows fighters from the Islamic State group marching in Raqqa, Syria. The Syrian foreign ministry said Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2014 that Washington informed Damascus' envoy to the United Nations before launching airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Syria, attacks that activists said inflicted casualties among jihadi fighters and civilians on the ground. (AP Photo/Militant Website, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc140ba240000320076efb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we look at the foreign fighters joining the wars in Syria and Iraq. Last week, the United Nations warned in a new report that terror groups in countries like Syria and Iraq are recruiting foreigners on an ""unprecedented scale."" An estimated 15,000 radicals from more than 80 nations are believed to have flocked to both war-torn nations to join extremist groups battling there. In its report, the U.N. said that that the foreign fighters could ""form the core of a new diaspora that may seed the threat for years to come. ""The WorldPost spoke with Peter Neumann, a professor at King's College in London and the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization, about the profile and the motivations of the foreigners who have joined groups like the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria and Iraq. ""There are certainly justified fears about this population, although there's no reason to be alarmist,"" Neumann says. Who heads to Iraq and Syria to fight?Various reports indicate that up to 15,000 fighters have gone to Syria and Iraq over the past three years to join the Sunni side. Of those 15,000, about 60 to 70 percent come from Middle Eastern countries, and about 20 to 25 percent come from Western countries, including Western Europe, the United States and Australia. Foreign fighters are not a monolithic entity, and not every one of them is like the guys you see in recruitment videos. Young people are going, quite old people are going, even women are going. Their motivations vary as well. At first, a lot of people joined because they were motivated by the plight of the Syrians. They were certainly Islamists, but they were not necessarily full-blown jihadists. Of those who traveled to Iraq and Syria more recently, many are very ideologically motivated. For some, there's also an element of adventure. The idea of fighting and using guns is clearly exciting a lot of people. While there was a bit of a stagnation in recruitment numbers earlier this year, the numbers have gone up again. People have been reenergized by the declaration of the Islamic State, by what they see as a caliphate, by the military victories and by the Western intervention there. People who are particularly motivated by the idea of a battle between the West and Islam are now identifying with that particular struggle more than they used to a year or two ago. What groups are these foreign fighters joining?About 80 percent of the Westerners end up with the Islamic State, and some join Jabhat al-Nusra. Very few join any of the more nationalist, secular and moderate groups.  Do fighters from countries like Algeria and Tunisia follow different paths from Western fighters?The patterns differ from country to country. With 3,000 and 2,500 fighters respectively, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia are the countries that recruit the most foreign fighters. Those people go to all kinds of groups. There are recruitment networks in place in a lot of these countries, and they have special relationships with particular groups. There are hardly any Westerners in Ahrar al-Sham, for example, but the group has lot of fighters from the Gulf. What makes the Islamic State so appealing to Western fighters? There are different factors at play. For a long time, IS was the only group that consistently did outreach in Western languages. In terms of the message, it also seems that it is also the most attractive group for people who want to fight for an ideology rather than for a free Syria. The Islamic State is also less selective than a lot of other groups. If you come from the West, don't speak Arabic, you're not a particularly good fighter and don't have a particular skill, IS will probably still accept you. Jabhat al-Nusra is a lot more selective, for example. You have to bring references and have to show that you're quite religious and can be useful to the group. This is not the first conflict to see the influx of fighters from abroad. What is different this time? The act of foreign fighting, the idea that people get mobilized for a conflict they are not directly involved in on the basis of a transnational ideology, is something that we’ve seen for centuries. The Spanish Civil War in the 1930s attracted people from all over the world. The Afghanistan conflict in the 1980s mobilized up to 20,000 foreign fighters. That last conflict is significant because what we're seeing playing out in Syria could actually be very similar. At the end of the Afghanistan conflict, fighters couldn’t go back to their home countries, and many decided to go from battlefront to battlefront. Al-Qaeda eventually came out of these networks. That's of course the fear now. Thousands of fighters are making connections in Syria. At the end of the conflict, you’ll have thousands of people who are extremely brutalized, who have the skills to be a fighter or terrorist, with nothing to do. What makes the current conflict different from for example the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s are the aims that people are fighting for. In the Spanish Civil War, left-wing people went to Spain to fight against fascism. I personally have a lot more sympathy for that motivation than for jihadis who want to create a society that's either killing or suppressing minorities. The act of fighting is the same, but the ultimate aim of the movement is very, very different. In addition to the fear that radicalized fighters are establishing new connections, what other dangers does the recruitment of foreign fighters by groups like the Islamic State pose?Foreign fighters tend to make conflicts worse because they are often very ideologically motivated and are more dependent on the group. They are often used for very brutal operations that locals refuse to carry out. In the Syrian conflict, suicide bombings, beheadings or torture are almost always carried out by foreigners. Foreign fighters have already made the conflict in Syria more sectarian, more extreme and harder to resolve. Secondly, when the conflict ends, there will be a large number of people who are skilled, brutalized and interconnected. There's of course a fear they will become involved in terrorism. One study has shown that 1 in 9 foreign fighters subsequently becomes involved in terrorism in their home countries. Other studies show that number may be slightly higher. There are also studies that indicate that if these people do become terrorists, they are better at it and are more lethal. There are certainly justified fears about this population, although there's no reason to be alarmist. How should governments respond to these threats?If there’s a reasonable suspicion that someone is about to go join a militant group in Syria or Iraq, I would be in favor of taking away their passports and preventing them from traveling. The long-term approach needs to be about prevention. We found that for a lot of people going over there, their experiences turn out to be very different than what they were promised. The true story of what it’s like to be a foreign fighter needs to be told. When you go over there, the Syrian population doesn't really like you. You'll probably end up fighting other Muslim groups that you kind of sympathize with. You may even die or be killed. What should we expect when those fighters return home?You’ll find different groups of people. There are people who are going to be dangerous, who do present security challenges for Western countries. They hate the West, and will probably become involved in attacks or are already talking about it. There are clearly people who will be disturbed, rather than dangerous. They will be traumatized by the conflict, the things they’ve seen and the things they’ve experienced. They are a risk to society, not necessarily because of their extremist ideology but because they are messed up in their head. And there’s a third group, that’s often being forgotten.

Wal-Mart employees and union supporters are taking part in today's nationwide demonstration for better pay and benefits A union-backed group called OUR Walmart, which includes former and current workers, staged the demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores on Black Friday, the day when retailers traditionally turn a profit for the year. (AP Photo/Nick Ut)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3161d3c000018010c48f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the wake of mounting protests from labor groups, numerous U.S. localities have approved minimum wage increases, including two of the nation’s largest cities, Seattle and San Francisco. Yet, especially among many of America’s largest employers, the remarkably low wages of most workers are in stark contrast with the compensation of shareholders and executives. And while the average hourly earnings of an American worker was $24.53 as of September, these companies pay most of their workers far less.Companies that pay employees the least tend to be part of one of three industries: retail, restaurant chains, and grocery stores. According to Arun Ivatury, campaign strategist at the National Employment Law Project, “These industries have embraced a low-wage business model. Their way of doing business is trying to squeeze as much out of their employees as they can, while paying them as little in wages and benefits as possible.” These industries fall into one of two sectors — leisure and hospitality and wholesale and retail trade — that together accounted for almost 70% of all jobs paying the minimum wage or below it, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.According to Ivatury, one reason wages are so low in these industries is that low pay represents an accepted practice. Ivatury was especially critical of how large-scale, low-wage employers viewed their workers. “You can come up with all kinds of labels like associate, or team partner,” Ivatury said. “It doesn’t change the fact that you’re paying them as little as $7.25 an hour.” Employees at these companies “are basically treated as dispensable.”Opponents of raising the minimum wage argue that doing so would lead to job cuts. Further, some policy analysts have stated that a more effective measure for alleviating poverty might be to raise the earned income tax credit. Increasingly, however, Americans are supporting a higher minimum wage. Last year, a Gallup survey revealed that 76% of Americans polled favored raising the minimum wage. Additionally, during the recent midterm elections, Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota voters approved measures to raise the minimum wage in their states.One possible obstacle for higher wages may be the slowing profitability at many of the nation’s largest low wage employers. Although eight of these 10 companies reported revenue growth during their last five fiscal years, only a few have also reported higher margins and and increased profitability. For example, Darden Restaurants’ earnings declined from $2.65 per share in 2009 to $2.15 in its 2014 fiscal yearAt the other end of the spectrum are companies such as TJX and Macy’s, both of which have become far more profitable in recent years. For TJX, earnings per share rose from $1.00 to $2.94 between 2009 and 2014. However, despite their growing profitability and the accompanying rise in stock prices, Ivatury said the companies still feel more of a responsibility to improve their investors’ fortunes than those of their employees. “They feel it’s their obligation to have their share price continue to rise, and continue to grow, year over year, as much as possible.”Several of these companies do not directly operate their stores. McDonald’s, Yum! Brands, and Starbucks, for example, franchise or license their businesses. Ivatury maintained that the franchise system is an extension of an overly financialized American economy, which has created a perverse set of incentives for CEOs to do virtually anything to increase the value of their stock. When companies franchise their business, they are able to focus more energy on the corporate brand, Ivatury said. “You’re essentially managing your brand in a shell and foisting both risk and responsibility for workers on some other entity.”Click here to see the Companies Paying Americans the LeastBased on the methodology used by the National Employment Law Project in its 2012 report “Big Business, Corporate Profits, and the Minimum Wage,” 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 companies that pay employees the least. These companies are in industries that typically pay low wages. We identified these industries based on the BLS’ Occupational Employment Statistics database as well as its report, “Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2013.” We then identified the largest employers in these industries using S&P Capital IQ, company annual reports, and information on corporate websites. We finally reviewed salary information submitted by employees to Glassdoor.com in order to screen out any companies where wages for the most common occupations were not either close to or less than $10 an hour.Included in our analysis were total U.S. employee figures, which we estimated when the figures were not provided by the company. In keeping with the NELP methodology, all employee figures represent systemwide employment, including employees of franchisees. Employee totals also include both full- and part-time workers. Starbucks is an exception. As many other low-wage employers are Starbucks licensees, we only considered company-owned stores to avoid double-counting low-wage workers.The recent performance of the corporations in terms of revenue, profitability, store count, and CEO pay at these companies, is based on figures published by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Morningstar. These data are all for the most recent fiscal year, except where noted.These are the companies paying Americans the least."

Six million Americans have signed up for private health plans under Obamacare, President Barack Obama said, a symbolic milestone for a government that has struggled to get the law off the ground. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc9b1f00003d022576ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As it prepares for both a wave of new health insurance shoppers and a return of many seeking to re-enroll, the team behind HealthCare.gov says the website will be able to handle twice as many simultaneous users as it did on the busiest day of its troubled first enrollment period.Visits to the website peaked at 125,000 concurrent users on March 31, 2014, which was the nominal deadline for individuals to sign up for health insurance, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency in charge of the insurance exchanges. Now, with new fixes, the site will be able to handle an estimated 250,000 individuals using the online health insurance application system at once. Open enrollment for health coverage next year begins next Saturday, Nov. 15, and will run through Feb. 15, 2015. Consumers will get a first look at prices early next week.The enhanced capacity of HealthCare.gov is one of several major technical improvements that Obama administration officials outlined in an interview with The Huffington Post on Friday. These officials say the fixes, taken together, will allow for a user experience far smoother than the one that followed the disastrous launch of HealthCare.gov on Oct. 1, 2013. ""We really wanted to spend the year focused on how to make it work better for consumers who were coming to HealthCare.gov, and we put through a series of upgrades over the summer,"" said Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at CMS. HealthCare.gov's performance already improved over the course of last year's open enrollment period. While the site was initially plagued by crashes that made it virtually impossible to use, a team of technicians eventually got the system working well enough to enroll millions of consumers for health insurance. But the reputational damage lingers, so much so that administration officials have fretted that potential customers might still be hesitant to use the site. President Barack Obama himself vowed earlier this week week that HealthCare.gov will perform better.""We're really making sure the website works super-well before the next open enrollment period. We're double- and triple-checking it,"" the president said during a press conference Wednesday. ""There are a number of people who, the first time around, sat on the sidelines, in part because of our screw-ups on HealthCare.gov,"" he added. Upwards of 7 million existing customers will be able to make changes to their coverage starting Nov. 15, and millions of new customers are expected to join them. HealthCare.gov serves insurance shoppers in more than 30 states, while an additional 13 states and the District of Columbia run their own exchanges.Organizationally, administration officials say that much has changed as well since October 2013. The team responsible for managing the website has been organized more hierarchically, and there are daily progress checks for the tasks in need of completion. While the administration has also brought in some new faces to help improve the website experience, the core of the CMS team and contractors who helped fix the site initially were either retained or kept working through the summer. These team members number in the ""hundreds,"" one official told HuffPost. Slavitt himself helped lead the HealthCare.gov rescue effort last year in his capacity as an executive at a subsidiary of the insurance company UnitedHealth Group, which was one of the government contractors working on the project. He officially joined the administration in June.""It's been an incredibly busy summer,"" he said. The main goals going into the second open enrollment, Slavitt said, were to improve the consumer experience, make the system faster and more reliable, boost capacity to serve large numbers of people at once and beef up security. Slavitt said that the administration had retained some elements of the original system, upgraded others, and replaced still others. The HealthCare.gov team streamlined the application process for about 70 percent of users, reducing the application's length from 76 pages to 16. Existing customers who return to the website to make changes to their coverage also won't have to re-enter their personal information because about 90 percent of it will be stored in the system, Slavitt said. The mobile version of HealthCare.gov also has been enhanced. An estimated 20 percent of applications during the inaugural enrollment period were filled out using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, according to to CMS. And Slavitt said that one of HealthCare.gov's most notorious features, a ""virtual waiting room"" where users got stuck when the website wasn't working, has been improved. Previously, if one component of the system was malfunctioning, no new users could begin any part of the application process and were instead forced to wait. Now, the system is able to keep different functions separate, so only visitors trying to use the balky part of the website will have to wait, while others can continue to access the rest of it.The first time around, HealthCare.gov didn't undergo adequate testing to reveal its flaws, which left the White House flat-footed when the website didn't work. In sharp contrast, in preparation for the second open enrollment period, CMS began four phases of testing more than a month ago. Slavitt expressed cautious optimism that his team's improvements had worked and that the testing was successful.""We hit all our dates and milestones. That doesn't mean we won't find bugs here and there, even after four rounds of testing, because that's how software works,"" he said. Even as the second enrollment period is set to begin, HealthCare.gov remains a work in progress, and Slavitt predicted that more tinkering will likely be needed. ""Are we all the way there? I think in year three, we'll have a list of things we will be able to do based upon what happened in year two that will make it even better,"" he said.See a slideshow demonstration of the new application process on HealthCare.gov: HealthCare.gov Streamlined For New Sign-Ups"

He gave no details.The U.S.-led coalition carried out air strikes near al-Qaim overnight, destroying an Islamic State armored vehicle and two checkpoints run by the group, Ryder said. BOMBINGSThe hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said, bringing to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.An attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. ""Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,"" said a police official.There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamist militants.In the town of Baquba, 65 km (40 miles) northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said. U.S. TROOPSWestern and Iraqi officials say air strikes are not enough to defeat the Sunni insurgents and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat.President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis.The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.The United States spent $25 billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding, and it may not be possible because of mistrust between Sunni tribes of Anbar and the Baghdad government.(Additional reporting by Ahmed Rasheed and Raheem Salman in Baghdad and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Dominic Evans)"

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc9424000050005774a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch by any account has the highest legal and educational pedigree imaginable to succeed Eric Holder as U.S. Attorney General. In fact, from the first moment that her name was dropped weeks ago as a possible replacement for Holder, the accolades were non-stop about her accomplishments prosecuting an assortment of crooked politicians, drug cartel heads, terror suspects, and most importantly, winning a conviction against the New York cops that beat and sodomized Haitian emigrant Abner Louima in 1997.  An added plus is that she can't be tagged as one of Obama's inner circle cronies, as the GOP repeatedly slandered Holder. In the mold of Holder she's been outspoken that a lock em' up and throw the key away approach to crime fighting won't work, especially when those who are most likely to have the key thrown away on them are young black males. Lynch went even further in February 2013 and told a symposium on ""Smart Justice: Changing How We Think About Crime and Punishment"" at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City that simply dumping more young black males in jail cells is a vicious cycle that insures they have nowhere to go and no support to break the crime and arrest cycle. But that forward thinking and her impeccable legal credentials and unsullied political ties are likely to count far less if the GOP is tempted to use her as yet another one of their foils to hammer Obama. The first light hint that the GOP may well be poised to follow this well-worn script came from GOP Senators Chuck Grassley and Ted Cruz, both of whom sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee. They were peeved that Obama would tap Lynch when many Democrats are lame ducks, and thus not giving the incoming wave of GOP Senate members a chance to have their say on Lynch. Another even more ominous hint that Lynch could be the GOP's latest whipping person came with the harp that she is supposedly close to Al Sharpton, and met with him during the protests around the strangle death of Eric Garner by New York police. This quickly morphed into the wild, irresponsible, and politically loaded question, ""Did Sharpton pick the next attorney general,"" that being Lynch.But that was less the issue than the fact Obama made the pick, any pick. The GOP could latch on to this in its relentless drive to tar Obama as an imperial president who thumbs his nose at Congress at every turn and chooses partisan handmaidens to do his bidding.A brief look at how that ploy played out against Holder is in order. It began during Holder's Senate confirmation hearing in 2009. He was grilled over his role as Deputy Attorney General in Bill Clinton's administration in a handful of controversial decisions. Holder was overwhelmingly confirmed as Attorney General. Yet, the flack he took was only the start. The GOP viewed him as a pawn in their relentless attack plan on Obama. If they could discredit, taint, and tarnish Holder for even the most picayune act, it would be another slap at Obama.In quick succession the GOP dithered and delayed confirmation of Chuck Hegel, and Thomas Perez, and stonewalled that of Susan Rice. It did the same with a slew of judicial and administration picks which have been frozen in limbo, withdrawn their names, or Obama has withdrawn them. The GOP has another compelling reason to try and figure out a way to brush aside Lynch's sterling credentials and make her a target. She almost certainly would carry on the fight Holder waged against voter registration discrimination through aggressive enforcement of the voting rights laws. This poses a major threat to the GOP's push to undermine the Voting Rights Act with a rash of voter ID laws and restrictions, topped by the lawsuit before the Supreme Court to scrub the Act. This is even more important with the opening gun of the 2016 presidential elections around the corner. The GOP's shellack of Democrats in the mid-terms would ultimately be wiped out if there is an upsurge in black and Latino voter's dash back to the polls in 2016. They made a huge difference in Obama's election and reelection victories, and in insuring Democrat gains in many state elections in 2008 and 2012. The full enforcement of the Voting Rights Act is a strong safeguard that those gains could be made again in 2016. This is the last thing the GOP wants. This would virtually insure the continued Democratic hold on the White House. The GOP may well dig to find any real or manufactured alleged impropriety by Lynch to toss at her during the confirmation proceedings. The GOP's dogged vow to hamstring Obama with the tag of a go-it-his-way president and further straightjacket his presidency poses the real likelihood that Lynch could be on the GOP's hot seat. If so, the issue again will not be Lynch, but Obama.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst. He is a weekly co-host of the Al Sharpton Show on American Urban Radio Network.

23,POLITICS,Romney: Democrats Lost Because They Weren't 'Proud' Enough Of Obama,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitt-romney-obama-2014_n_6125112.html,,2014-11-08,"Fomer Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney speaks before introducing Georgia Republican U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue at a campaign event, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2014, in Augusta, Ga. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc94260000300183bcb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney might have been forgiven for gloating a little about this week's election. A half-dozen GOP Senate candidates pulled a page from Romney's 2012 playbook and ran successfully as moderate, pro-business Republicans, helping the GOP take control of the Senate for the first time in nearly a decade.But instead of patting himself on the back Friday during an appearance at the Israeli American Council's inaugural national conference, Romney paid President Barack Obama a compliment, of sorts, telling the audience he believed a major reason Democrats lost the Senate was that they didn't align themselves closely enough with the president. Democratic Senate candidates campaigned as, ""I'm not president Obama, I'm as far from him as I can be,"" Romney said. ""I think it would have been wiser to say, 'I liked what the president did here, I'm proud of what we did there, I applaud what we did here, there are some things I think he did wrong, but these things I'm proud of,"" he more than 500 attendees. ""I think that would have been a better strategy."" Romney is familiar with the topic. He spent much of his losing 2012 presidential campaign trying to distance himself from the universal health care law he signed while governor of Massachusetts. He delivered Friday's comments in a way that both knocks the Democratic Party and appears gracious. The event was set up as a question-and-answer program with former George W. Bush administration adviser Dan Senor. Romney spent much of it bashing Obama's foreign policy. Romney said he was ""stunned"" and ""speechless"" to learn from news reports that Obama had written to the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, about the need for Iran and the U.S. to combat the so-called Islamic State terror group. Romney called the letter ""an enormous error,"" which he said ""diminished"" the U.S. and ""leads bad people to believe that America can be pushed around."" Many of Romney's comments garnered applause mid-sentence from the mostly Israeli-American audience. The non-profit Israeli American Council was founded in 2007 and centered primarily in Los Angeles until last year, when an infusion of money from conservative casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson helped launch the group nationally. Adelson's wife, Miriam Adelson, is Israeli-American. Adelson was among the largest individual donors to pro-Romney causes during the 2012 presidential campaign, contributing around $150 million to various non-profits, PACs and dark-money groups designed to help get Romney elected. Adelson's record in presidential politics served to fuel speculation among attendees at Friday's event about a potential Romney campaign for the White House in 2016. The former Massachusetts governor did not address the gossip, however, and Senor didn't ask him about it. "

Helsinki's ""Final Act"" recognized the sovereignty of East Germany and other Soviet satellites and banned any ""armed intervention or threat of such intervention against another participating State."" In effect, the Helsinki Accords were an ironclad assurance that neither NATO nor the U.S. would take military action against the Warsaw Pact. It greatly reduced Soviet paranoia that the West might someday attempt to reunify the country by force of arms.   An unexpected consequence of Helsinki was that its seemingly half-hearted and ineffectual safeguards for human rights spawned the ""Helsinki Rights"" movement. Over the course of the next five or 10 years, the Eastern bloc countries, as well as the Soviet Union, faced an explosion of grassroots clubs, community groups, and individual activists, all demanding that their government honor the human rights pledges laid out in the Helsinki Accords. The organization, ""Helsinki Watch,"" emerged with the express purpose of monitoring and publicizing abuses in signatory states. The Berlin Wall had its origins in an attempt to stop people from fleeing East Berlin in search of political freedom and a chance for a better life in the West. Once an East German citizen made it into West Berlin he or she could apply for asylum, and many of those who defected were educated professionals, which caused a ""brain drain."" By 1961, the crisis became so acute that it prompted Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, along with his East German allies, to order the Berlin Wall to be built as a means of stemming the tide. The edifice itself was an architectural monstrosity with an elaborate system of gun towers, barbed wire, and even a moat made of sand to detect footprints. In the summer of 1962, President John F. Kennedy had delivered one of his most memorable speeches at the city hall in West Berlin, to a crowd of several hundred thousand Berliners. Twenty-five years later, when President Ronald Reagan spoke at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin on June 12, 1987, a generation of people had grown up who had difficulty imagining a world where that hideous symbol of human oppression no longer existed. Despite Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev's reform agenda and the ongoing popular struggles in Eastern Europe, in 1988 East Berlin did not appear to be a city on the brink of a revolution. The pro-Soviet German Democratic Republic (GDR) still routinely dispersed crowds of nonviolent protestors. In January 1988, the Stasi security services arrested over a hundred demonstrators who were simply commemorating the 1919 murder of the revolutionaries Rosa Luxemberg and Karl Liebknecht. Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old leader of the GDR, flatly rejected Gorbachev's vision of perestroika and glasnost for East Germany. In the spring of 1989, Honecker dug in his heals holding municipal elections where government candidates won 98.8 percent of the vote. But events began moving very quickly after the Soviet-sponsored government in Hungary decided in early May 1989, as part of its own Gorbachev-style restructuring, to turn off the electrified fence that sealed the country's western border. Officially the Hungarian frontier with Germany was still ""closed"" but when the news of the relaxed border control became known in East Germany people began flooding across it. In a matter of weeks there were over 25,000 GDR citizens ""on holiday"" in Hungary, and by early September the number had swelled to 60,000. Thousands of people sought refuge inside the West German embassy in Budapest, and when the government announced it would take no action against GDR nationals going to Austria, about 22,000 more GDR citizens dashed through the border. Following these fast-moving events even a crusty authoritarian like Honecker had to recognize that he had a major public-relations disaster on his hands.   Gorbachev visited East Germany in October to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of its founding and he urged Honecker to move toward greater liberalization. But Honecker made it clear he had no intention of following Gorbachev's reformist path. Within weeks enormous demonstrations broke out in Leipzig and other East German cities and some GDR officials close to Honecker believed that he might be contemplating a ""Tiananmen Square""-style solution to the problem. Four months earlier, in June 1989, the Chinese communist government cracked down on pro-democracy protesters killing hundreds of people and jailing thousands. Believing that Honecker might indeed follow China's lead, GDR authorities, led by Egon Krenze, staged a coup d'etat against the septuagenarian after eighteen years in power. Krenze flew to Moscow to meet with Gorbachev and upon his return promised to implement an East German version of perestroika. But the East German government was losing control of the situation. Demonstrations in Leipzig grew past 300,000 people, and in early November hundreds of thousands of East Germans were participating in daily protests in the streets of Berlin. Another 30,000 GDR citizens emigrated after Czechoslovakia also relaxed its border enforcement. Then, on November 9, 1989, the Krenze government, in attempt to ""stabilize"" the situation, agreed to allow East Germans to freely visit West Germany. The announcement, delivered almost inadvertently at a press conference by the GDR's foreign minister, rendered the Berlin Wall obsolete.   People came from all over Europe to help Berliners tear down what had become one of the world's preeminent symbols of police-state oppression. They converged on the Wall with picks and sledgehammers and battered down its ugly concrete edifice as Stasi guards stood by watching. The spectacle of hundreds of joyous people literally demolishing the Wall came to symbolize the power of ordinary people, even in a ""totalitarian"" state, to forge a new era of political freedom. By Christmas 1989, one in six East Germans, about 2.4 million people, had crossed into West Berlin to visit friends and relatives or to just look around for the first time. There was a huge shopping spree as GDR citizens voraciously snapped up consumer goods that had been denied them under the stagnant economy of the East. The path had been cleared for reunifying Germany that had been split in half since the end of World War Two, and the unification of the country came less than a year after the Wall came down (on October 3, 1990)."

Our politics continue to be distorted and corrupted.In October, 1994, I was in the lounge at Kennedy Airport in New York City waiting to board an Egypt Air flight to Cairo. My fellow passengers, mostly Egyptians, were seated near a television watching a rather engaging program. Being just a few weeks before Election Day, each of the commercial breaks that interrupted the show featured hard-hitting political ads. They were dramatic and graphically compelling as such ads can be, with both the Democratic and Republican candidates' campaigns ferociously attacking each other. One ad raised questions about a candidate's integrity, strongly suggesting that he may have had links to organized crime. This was followed by an ad which flashed headlines claiming that the other candidate hadn't paid taxes and may have been involved in shady financial dealings of one sort or another. These same ads, with slight variants of these themes, played over and over again during each of the TV program's breaks.An hour or so later, as we boarded the flight, I thought to myself ""what must these Egyptians be thinking?"" Would it be something like this: ""So this is American democracy, where you get to chose between the criminal and the cheat?""That was the situation two decades ago. Today, it is even worse. Living in the Washington, DC media market, which serves both Maryland and Virginia, both of which featured statewide elections, the attack ads were ugly and mind-numbing. It was even worse in other states. In the hotly contested race for the Senate seat in Iowa, voters were subjected to over 114,000 TV ads. Nationally, over one billion dollars were spent on Senate races alone. The tally for gubernatorial and Congressional races more than matched that amount.The bottom line is that as pundits and partisans alike are tallying the winners and losers of this year's contests, they should not forget to consider that the real winners were the campaign media consultants and the owners of local television stations, both of whom pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenues. And the real losers were our democracy and the American people, who were turned off by the continuing distortion and corruption of our politics.2. Did Republicans win the election or did Democrats lose it?As early as January of 2009, minority leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell declared that he was determined to do everything within his power to block the newly elected President's agenda. A year later, he went further saying that he would work to make sure that Obama was ""a one-term President"". Unlike Democrats who worked, some begrudgingly, with George W. Bush early in his first term to help pass his signature tax-cuts and educational reform legislation, Republicans gave no ground to President Obama. Whatever legislative victories the president won in his first few years in office were won over stiff resistance from the Republican opposition. Contributing to the hyper-partisanship in Washington were the emergence of the Tea Party and the ""birther"" movement, both of which added to the nation's poisonous political atmosphere.There are those who raise issue with Obama's aloofness or his ""lack of relationships"" with Congressional Republicans, ignoring the fact that the increasingly hard-right wing of the GOP never wanted to give relationship-building a chance. They had declared from the outset that they would stymie his efforts and work to defeat him. On too many occasions where compromise might have been possible, the Republican leadership fearing confrontation with their hard-liners, balked at compromise, choosing obstructionism instead.The problem with too many Democrats was that they cowered in the face of this GOP assault. As my brother, John, noted: in this November's election, while Republicans were busy running against the President, Democrats were running away from him. Instead of campaigning for the real benefits realized by millions of Americans resulting from the Administration's accomplishments: in rescuing the economy which had been in free-fall in 2009; in guaranteeing health insurance coverage for young people and those with pre-existing conditions; in saving college students millions of dollars in student loan fees and in protecting Americans from unscrupulous credit card companies -- too many Democrats sought to deny their connections with these programs, giving Republicans a free ride to attack with no response.When Democratic candidates wouldn't own their successes and sought to distance themselves from their national agenda -- what choice did they give voters?This mattered especially as the election came down to the wire and the issue became which party would succeed in the all-important effort to turn out voters. With the President sidelined, his 2008/2012 victorious coalition (African-Americans, Latinos, young people, unmarried professional women, etc.) was not encouraged to turn out in the numbers needed to win. At one point, the President was criticized for saying that while he was not on the ballot, his policies were. He was right and his critics were wrong.When you lose the struggle to define the stakes in the election, your chances of winning are slim.3. What happens next?There was an article this week describing how Republicans, having won control of both houses of Congress, were now working to define their agenda for the next two years. Implied in the piece was the fact that other than their opposition to the President, there is no consensus within the GOP as to how they will govern. The party is deeply divided between: neo-conservatives and isolationists; those who emphasize ""social"" issues and those who focus on economic policy; and establishment types and the Tea Party. With the 2016 presidential contest looming over the horizon and with many of the protagonists of these competing views seeing themselves as potential candidates, it is unlikely that the Republicans will be able to unify their ranks any time soon.As they continue their internal struggle, they should consider two facts. In the first place, before getting high-handed about their ""mandate"", Republicans should remember that while they won the Senate and increased their numbers in the House, a tally of votes, nationally, shows that overall more Americans voted for Democrats than for Republicans. Republicans should also remember that voters will keep them on a short leash, watching how effectively they will govern. While Republicans are fond of noting that President Obama's favorable ratings are a low 42 percent, they should remember that their party's favorable rating is a full 10 points lower and Congress' approval rating is a shockingly low 12 percent.What we can most likely expect in the next two years are more dysfunction, more rancor, and more gridlock. This will not serve the nation, but it will enhance opportunities for the Democrats to regain control of the Senate in 2016 when the tables will be turned. This year, 2/3's of the contested Senate seats were held by Democrats -- some of whom were swept into office by the Obama coat-tails of 2008. In 2016, it will be Republicans who will be on the defensive since 2/3's of those up for reelection will be from their party.In the 2016 presidential election year, the Democrats will again have a demographic advantage. African American, Latino, Asian, young, and professional women -- all of whom increasingly vote for Democrats, will all play key roles in the national election. Their participation will also have an impact on Senate contests.And so it is in this seemingly endless game of politics, one round is over and it's on to the next.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

(AP) — Authorities searched for the missing McStay family across California and into Mexico, and found their bodies in the desert a hundred miles from home.They now say the family of four was slain before they ever left their house, and a man familiar to them was their killer.Investigators believe that Joseph McStay, 40, his wife, Summer, 43, and their sons, 4-year-old Gianni and 3-year-old Joseph, were bludgeoned to death in their home in the San Diego County community of Fallbrook on Feb. 4, 2010, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said Friday.Charles ""Chase"" Merritt, 57, a business associate of Joseph McStay, was charged with four counts of murder.Merritt, who has served prison time for burglary and receiving stolen property, did not enter a plea during a brief court appearance and was due back in court next week.His attorney, Robert Ponce, did not immediately return a call or email.Authorities refused to discuss a motive or any further details of how the family was killed, or evidence found at the home or at the site of the shallow graves 100 miles to the north where their skeletal remains were found by an off-roader late last year near Victorville and Interstate 15.Tearful family members said the arrest brought them some peace but left many questions.""Joseph was a great brother, a great father,"" Joseph McStay's brother, Michael McStay, said as he choked back tears. ""He would've done anything to protect those boys and Summer and he tried to help Chase and provide work for this guy and this is how he was repaid. ... He'll get what he's got coming to him.""There was no ""smoking gun"" that helped solve the case after so many years, San Bernardino County sheriff's Sgt. Chris Fisher said.Rather, the agency re-examined 4,500 pages of evidence handed over by authorities in San Diego County, where the probe began, served 60 search warrants and did 200 interviews. Evidence found at the gravesite also helped, Fisher said, declining to elaborate.""Our job is to look at everyone and eliminate who we could and see where this was going to take us — and it led us to him,"" he said of Merritt.Bennett Merritt, Merritt's brother, said in a brief phone interview that his sibling was ""absolutely not guilty.""Joseph McStay designed and installed home water features. Investigators said he had asked Merritt, who owned a waterfall company, to design some special waterfalls, and the two met at a restaurant on the day the family is believed to have been killed.Merritt's name had surfaced previously in the investigation. In 2011, Merritt told investigators that Joseph McStay's last cellphone conversation was to him. Fisher said investigators had interviewed Merritt several times but declined to say what information he provided.The long, convoluted investigation began when the family vanished from their home without a trace. At the time, San Diego County sheriff's detectives said it appeared they had fled at a moment's notice.Investigators found their dogs outside with no food or water, eggs rotting on a counter, and bowls full of popcorn in the house.Four days after the family vanished, their white Isuzu Trooper was found at a San Diego shopping mall just steps from Tijuana, Mexico. A dark surveillance video shows four people walking across the border.Authorities initially thought they might have been the McStays but later discounted that theory.Investigators said there were no signs of forced entry at the family home or in their SUV. Nothing was missing from the home, and the couple's credit cards and tens of thousands of dollars in bank accounts were untouched.Merritt was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles.He was sentenced to a total of more than two years in prison in the 1970s and 1980s for convictions on burglary, receiving stolen property and violating parole, said Bill Sessa, a prison spokesman.Court records in Los Angeles County show he also was sentenced for grand theft and burglary in 2001.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
