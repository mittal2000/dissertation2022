0,WELLNESS,Could Using a Simple Dog Command Help Us Leave the Past Where It Belongs?,"Gregg McBride, Contributor
Author, screenwriter and blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-using-a-simple-dog-co_us_5b9dd4f3e4b03a1dcc8d8751,"By telling ourselves to ""leave"" something that's weighing us down (figuratively or otherwise), we then, too, have the opportunity to move on to other things. We can't undo what's transpired. But we can move on if we choose to.",2014-02-07,2014-02-03-LearningWhentoLEAVEITBehindjuststopeatingosmuch.com.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-03-LearningWhentoLEAVEITBehindjuststopeatingosmuch.com-thumb.jpg,"The other morning, while working out at the gym, I had a work-related stress playing on an endless loop in my head. Even though the incident had happened a week earlier, I was still obsessing over the whole ordeal (wishing I'd said things I didn't say at the time, wishing the other party would come to their senses, wishing the whole thing would go away, etc.). Needless to say, my worrying about this incident only made things worse in my mind and even though I'd had a productive workout, left me in a gloomy state of mind as I left the gym.It was while driving home from working out that I remembered one of the key commands I picked up during dog training that I use pretty frequently with my puppy, Latte.As anyone who has a dog probably knows, our canine friends occasionally come across a smell, a chicken bone or some other foul object that excites their senses to no end. It's at this moment that we must command them to ""Leave it!"" in a terse, authoritative way so that they don't get into trouble, hurt themselves or (heaven forbid!) end up rolling in something disgusting.Even though I had been expertly trained to use this command with Latte, I realized after my workout of mental duress that perhaps I needed to use this command on myself. After all, as mentioned, this particular stressful situation had happened a week earlier. So at this point, no one else (not even the offending party) was responsible for my stress and worry other than yours truly. On a virtual level, I was ""rolling"" in something disgusting. In this case, my own self-defeating thoughts.So in this case, I was the one who needed to ""Leave it!""When Latte is told to ""Leave it,"" he usually jumps (having been ""caught"" doing something that he should know better than to do) and then quickly moves away from the offensive object and is soon distracted by another smell, a passing pooch or some other form of whimsy. Similarly, by telling ourselves to ""leave"" something that's weighing us down (figuratively or otherwise), we then, too, have the opportunity to move on to other things -- more pleasant things, and with a cleared mind, perhaps even a potential solution to whatever we think we can't solve while in the throes of ""Why me?"" We can't undo what's transpired. But we can move on if we choose to.I imagine that, like myself, many of you reading this are sometimes plagued by situations, incidences or predicaments that sometimes can't be washed away from our brains -- as if obsessing over them might offer a solution (which, really, the obsessing never does). Instead, we need to just let it go, move on and welcome another scent (or situation) that can offer us not only new ideas, but also peace.All together now: ""Leave it!""I'll conclude by adding that if you ever see me working out with a scowl, feel free to walk over and tersely tell me to, ""Leave it!"" Like my puppy, Latte, I might jump (having also been ""caught""). But I'll appreciate the reminder that some things need to be left where they belong... In the past."

2,TRAVEL,"Opera Tavern and The Ape & Bird in London: Two Informal, Bustling Restaurants With Good Food","Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opera-tavern-and-the-ape_us_5b9dd7a5e4b03a1dcc8da757,We certainly never imagined that it would be such a harmonious concoction with such appealing contrasts of flavor and texture.,2014-02-07,Opera Tavern's downstairs bar-dining room with a kitchen view,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd7a42500003300369d83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Here's a quick look at a couple of lively and friendly London bar-restaurants within spitting distance of Covent Garden and the West End theater district. Jackie and I visited them for light suppers in the late evening, one after the opera and one after a play, but they're also nice, fuss-free options for pre-theater dining -- or indeed for lunch or dinner at regular meal times -- so long as you don't expect a side order of tranquility with your food.Opera Tavern is just down the street from the Royal Opera House, but we went there after a play at The Old Vic across the river near Waterloo Station. On my gravely flawed mental map of London, that didn't seem very nearby, but to our surprise we walked there in less than 20 minutes at strolling pace and would have been there in a flash had we hopped into a cab. The food at this two-year-old restaurant is -- I won't say a mash-up of Spanish and Italian small dishes, but it draws on both traditions, plus a dose of creativity and London trend-spotting. There's an upstairs and a downstairs; the friend who sent us here advised us to ask for a downstairs table, which affords a view of the happy scene at the bar and of a small open kitchen containing a Spanish ham on a carving cradle and a charcoal grill - it's always fun to watch fire, isn't it? (There's another basement kitchen from which many of the non-grilled dishes ascend in a dumbwaiter.) It is a busy place, quite noisy but not irritatingly so; all is very amiable, including the informal and able service.I got a mild case of brain overload from the menu; it is divided into eight sections (plus dessert) and is printed on both sides of the paper. So, if you're not determined to study it carefully and if you're eager to eat, you will make hasty decisions. That's not such a bad thing, but it can leave the nagging feeling that you're missing the one dish that would have made your day. So, after ordering glasses of good wine from an interesting list, we picked more or less at random, apart from one thing that we'd been instructed to order: a small but thick burger made of Ibérico pork and foie gras, which was about as exciting as a hamburger can be. Juicy, porky meat perfectly seasoned and charcoal grilled, with the edgy richness of foie gras (or actually its fat, where all the goodness lies), was garnished with two kinds of onions, lettuce and a side of pickled hot chilies. The balance was optimal, and after my first bite I ordered another one, my mouth still full. I just couldn't resist.Nothing else reached that height of deliciousness, but not many things on this Earth could. A Scotch egg with morcilla (blood sausage) in the meat stuffing was fun; the morcilla mixture wasn't of deep flavor, but the accompanying pepper relish and garlic mayonnaise made it an entirely satisfying dish. On the other hand, we ordered two one-piece plates of a Cornish scallop with squash puree and smoked caper butter; one was fine, the other was smaller and seriously overcooked. For both, the squash was cold (not intentionally, I think) and the smoke and caper flavors so subtle as to be undetectable.Dessert was a wonderful surprise: It was dulce de leche panna cotta with apple, chestnut crumble and yogurt sorbet (talk of a mash-up!). I am not sure why we ordered it; we certainly never imagined that it would be such a harmonious concoction with such appealing contrasts of flavor and texture.In part because of its good location, but also because of that pork burger, we shall be back on our next trip to explore another section or two of that complicated menu.* * *You'd never know it when you walk past, but The Ape & Bird Public House, which opened in late 2013, is a vast place. There's a ground-floor bar/dining room, another ground-floor pub, a second dining room one flight up, and a bar with sofas in the basement. (To get to the lone set of toilets, downstairs, you'll need to pick your way through all four rooms, which is not what I call convenient.) Even at 10:40 on a rainy night, most of these spaces were heaving with customers, mainly happily drinking and yelling to be heard over the loud music. But, as I'd been told when I phoned earlier in the day, by that hour the upstairs dining room was emptying as the kitchen's closing time approached, and we were taken to a table immediately (reservations are accepted only at lunchtime). It wasn't exactly silent upstairs either, but it wasn't nearly as noisy and we were able to discuss the opera without too much ""WHAT DID YOU SAY??"".For the most part, the frequently changing menu covers the expected London ground, with (when we were there) deviled kidneys, crab on toast, mutton mince (ground meat and gravy with dumplings), sausages, roasts and the obligatory variation on a Scotch egg, this one made with pig's foot meat rather than ordinary sausage meat. It was the eve of Burns Night, so Jackie ordered the festive special: haggis, mashed yellow turnips (rutabaga) and mashed potatoes. The haggis was highly and interestingly seasoned -- and not in a goofy way (a strange version we ate elsewhere had curry powder in it), and the oats retained the chewiness that makes for good eating. The turnips were particularly well prepared: not over-mashed, with just the right amount of texture. To my surprise, I found myself ordering another burger -- a cheeseburger -- and I'm glad I did: it was well seared, juicy and messy to the point where I had to resort to a knife and fork after a while. (If I'd seen this post on Huffington Post Taste, I probably wouldn't have humiliated myself in that way.)I can't call The Ape & Bird unique in its approach, but it is certainly a place to visit either for a drink (they serve good beer) or for a fairly quick bite.Opera Tavern. 23 Catherine Street, London WC2B 5JS; +44 (0)20 7836 3680; info@operatavern.co.uk; http://www.operatavern.co.uk/.

The case, detailed in the journal The Lancet, involved a patient who visited a Marburg University clinic in Germany in 2012. The patient had severe heart failure, but he did not have coronary artery disease, which is a common cause of the condition. However, the patient's symptoms seemed very similar to those of a patient seen on an episode of the TV show House. In the episode, the patient's symptoms were caused by cobalt poisoning as a result of debris from a metal hip replacement. A check in to the real-life patient's medical history revealed that he had also undergone a metal-on-plastic hip replacement, which, half a year later, led to a number of symptoms including loss of sight and hearing, hypothyroidism and fever. Ultimately, he experienced heart failure. The doctors diagnosed him with cobalt poisoning, and sent him back to his orthopedic clinic to receive a new hip -- this time, one made of ceramic. After this hip replacement, his heart functioning improved. ""Cobalt intoxication has been a well known cause of cardiomyopathy for over 50 years; however, it has mostly been known in the context of so-called Quebec beer drinkers’ cardiomyopathy and hard steel work-related exposure to cobalt,"" the researchers wrote in the study. While cobalt for use in hip replacements is considered an ""excellent and stable compound,"" there are certain scenarios where a metal hip replacement with cobalt could lead to cobalt intoxication. ""In certain situations -- false placement, technical problems in metal-on-metal prosthesis, and strikingly often after an off-label replacement of broken ceramic hips by metal parts -- cobalt exposure to the patient from a hip prosthesis occurs,"" they wrote in the study. ""This cobalt intoxication is an increasingly recognized and life-threatening problem."" "

Every afternoon, we'd put them down for their nap, and once that bedroom door shut, the pants came off. Of course, it would have been fine if they stopped there, but no, they wanted to go Full Monty, which meant the diaper had to come off too. Watching from the baby monitor, I'd run in there yelling, ""Diaper, on! Keep your diapers on!"" I'd change them again and put their clothes back on. But, as soon as I left the room, the strip show continued. This went on for months. I'm not kidding. Months! Everyone kept saying it was a phase and it would pass, but I always thought a phase lasted, I don't know, a couple of weeks. We tried reasoning with them. We tried bribing them. I yelled... a lot. One afternoon, I even ended up on the floor in tears after I ran in to find them peeing off the side of their cribs onto the carpet, their discarded poopy diapers smeared on their sheets. Again, not kidding. Ultimately, we discovered that nothing was really going to get through to our (then) 19-month-olds, so we resorted to duct tape, sealing those diapers on before naps and bedtime. We even turned their pajamas backwards so they couldn't unzip them. They tried, oh, they tried to Houdini their way out, but ultimately realized their arms weren't long enough... and that they were no match for industrial adhesive. Soon after, they just lost interest. Just like that -- their nudist naptime antics had finally come to an end. Or, at least, that brand of antics. A couple of months ago, out of nowhere, my boys climbed out of their cribs. They did it several times in a row until one boy wound up on the floor screaming, ""My back, ouch, my back."" I would have kept them in cribs until, say, college, but with a risk of bodily injury, clearly our days of containment were over. So, now we were dealing with a whole new kind of crazy at naptime. After they ripped the baby monitors off the wall, broke a lamp, pulled knobs off of their dresser and knocked over their nightstand, we realized we basically had to strip that room down to nothing. Of course, they still seem to find ways to create mischief -- somehow pulling clothes out of their child-locked dresser, scaling said dresser, climbing on top of the couch to reach stuffed animals on a very high shelf. And since they trashed the baby monitor, I have no way of knowing exactly how they're making all of this happen. Unless they're magic babies. Maybe they're magic babies. Anyway, I thought this would be yet another phase. Maybe it would take, oh, a few weeks for the novelty to die down. But no, not really. Now with damn near nothing in that room to hold their interest, they're making up games to play during naptime. They run from one end of the room to the other. They jump on the couch to hide from dragons. They lift up the shades and say hi to people walking by. For a period of time, they were ultimately falling asleep... it just took about 45 minutes. I'd find them crashed out like drunken frat boys, one kid face down on a chair with his feet hanging off of the side, the other on the floor, his giant stuffed gorilla pulled on top of him. When I would get them up, I almost wanted to go in like some Mommy cop, shining a flashlight in their faces, nudging them with my toe, ""Soooomeone had a rough afternoon, huh? Maybe if you'd gone to sleep when you were supposed to instead of running around like a coupla hooligans...""We were away for the holidays and between the time change, all of the excitement, and a new room to destroy like rock stars, their naps just completely disappeared. For two weeks, I tried to put them down. I went in there and scolded and threatened until I just gave up on their naps altogether. Were they done with naps for good? Was this the end of that two-hour afternoon break for both boys and me? Noooooooooo, I mentally screamed. Once we got home, things went back to normal for, hmmm, maybe a split second and then, just like that, went all screwy again. I'm afraid to admit it, but I think our days of naptime bliss may be coming to an end. Way back when they were babies, I remember sitting in a Mommy and Me class, full of exhausted new moms consistently confused about sleep and eating and desperate to know, ""What happened? What now? How do I get baby to eat more, sleep more, cry less? When can we have that secret code that'll help us figure out these damn infants? Because you know that we know that you know it, oh wise Mommy teacher."" Week after week, we came at her with questions, wanting to know, exactly, exactly what to do. Then, one day, she told us the secret code: The one thing you can count on is that, with kids, you can't count on anything. It all keeps changing and once you think you've figured it out, they throw everything out of whack again. Sometimes it goes back to normal, sometimes it's a new normal, but the changes will keep coming.These last couple of months, I've tried to keep those wise words in mind, just as I did last year when I was buying duct tape and carpet cleaner in bulk. With babies and toddlers, everything is a phase and we as parents are powerless against their continuous evolution. Their habits are always in flux -- nothing is forever, good or bad. Either way, we have no choice but to just keep rolling with the punches, take some deep breaths and adapt. I have no idea what's next with my mischievous little angels, and I'm pretty sure I won't really be prepared. Sure, it would be nice to have all of the answers, but as any seasoned parent will probably tell you, ""Hahahahahahahaha.""Also on HuffPost:"

In fact, there is no such thing as a ""classic Chinatown:"" each one's got a different quirky flavor, infused by the city around it. Here are 10 of our worldwide favorites.Bangkok, Thailand ""Huge"" and ""bustling with life,"" THIS is what you think of when you think Chinatown. It's a crowded ""human bottleneck"" at Trok Itsaranuphap, the traditional wet market where you'll find half-alive filleted fish and crazy-looking vats of soaking meat. Take a breather at the 24-hour flower market or Wat Mangkon Kamalawat, a Buddhist temple that's big on incense. Toronto, Canada You’ve got your street-side trinket vendors and your open-air food stalls... but then you’ve got the sweet and sour chicken at Lee Garden Restaurant. Wash it down with tea from Ten Ren while you scour walls of herbs and hand-painted teapots. The party overflows outside of Chinatown for the annual Toronto Dragon Boat Race, when teams from all over the world come to row homemade boats painted like critters.Singapore City, Singapore Singapore's Chinatown is, to put it lightly, odd. First you'll scan the streets of kitschy shops for some dried seahorses. Next, make your way to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, home to -- you guessed it! -- a Buddha's tooth. Fill up on pig brain soup, then hit RN Spa for massage with ""oriental chopsticks"" or a ""kung fu ball."" Kolkata, India Some complain it's run-down and shady. Others call it authentic. But mention the joyous collision of Chinese and Indian food, and we're there in a heartbeat. Legend goes that in the 70s, a Kolkata chef invented Chicken Manchurian by replacing spices with soy sauce in a traditional Indian meat dish. Chicken Manchurian is now famous all over the country... but you'll find the best in Chinatown.Sydney, Australia It’s smaller than most Chinatowns, yes. But snuggled between skyscrapers, Sydney Chinatown has got enough flair to make up for it. Haggle at the Night Market, where rows of vendors will try to sell you offbeat snacks and “funky fashions.” Yum cha is the proper term for taking tea with dumplings-- and when you yum cha at East Ocean Restaurant, it’s the “closest to Honkers” (that's Aussie speak for Hong Kong) you’re going to get. Manila, Philippines Manila's Chinatown -- officially named Binondo -- is the oldest in the world. Start your tour in Umbrella Alley, where you'll choose from oodles of savory street food carts. They're a mere warm-up for the infamous Café Mezzanine, home of the infamously slimy bull testicle soup. If Buddhism is your style, visit Kuang Kong Temple and swirl incense around some mysterious wooden disks. When you throw them to the ground, they'll answer your most burning questions. London, U.K. More than one visitor uses ""lively"" to describe this little Chinatown, where celebrations get surprisingly big for the lunar new year. Chat with street vendors or go sit-down at Cafe TPT, known for the whole chickens dangling in the window, bowls of hot stuffed tofu, and to-die-for bubble tea.
