0,SPORTS,Are Baseball Writers Discriminating Against Craig Kimbrel?,"John A. Tures, ContributorPolitical science professor, LaGrange College in Georgia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/are-baseball-writers-disc_b_6123748.html,"Once again, baseball writers are about to discriminate against a talented player for merely being the best at his position.  If the sport was more about being a meritocracy, we would have a few more votes for Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Craig Kimbrel for the Cy Young Award.",2014-11-10,2014-11-07-10671213_832336853467703_3729165919162327317_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-10671213_832336853467703_3729165919162327317_n-thumb.jpg,"Once again, baseball writers are about to discriminate against a talented player for merely being the best at his position. If the sport was more about being a meritocracy, we would have a few more votes for Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Craig Kimbrel for the Cy Young Award, and maybe the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in Major League Baseball.The headlines have been dominated by Los Angeles Dodgers hurler Clayton Kershaw, expected to be a finalist for the MVP and Cy Young Award. An Associated Press article touting Kershaw's candidacy reported:Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw became the first pitcher to lead the major leagues in earned run average in four straight years, and Houston's Jose Altuve and Colorado's Justin Morneau won their first batting titles. Kershaw's 1.77 ERA was the lowest in the National League since Greg Maddux's 1.63 for Atlanta in 1995.Actually, that's not quite true. Kershaw may have been the first starting pitcher to lead the major leagues in ERA and had the lowest ERA for a starting pitcher since Greg Maddux. But he would have to give up fewer earned runs in a nine-inning game to top Kimbrel.Craig Kimbrel's ERA for 2014 was 1.61, lower than Kershaw's and Maddux's. The year before, it was 1.21. In 2012, his ERA was 1.01. In 2011, his first full year, when he was the Rookie of the Year, it was 2.10. In four full seasons from 2011-2014 (he pitched in 21 games in 2010), Kimbrel's average ERA is 1.43. His save totals are 46, 42, 50 and 47. His average strikeouts per nine innings are 14.8 (in 2014 it was 13.9), while his K-to-walk ratio is 4.41 (in 2014, it was 3.65). Regardless of how well the Atlanta Braves are doing, Kimbrel gets the job done. Turner Field lights up with flames as Craig Kimbrel gets a save against the Washington Nationals in September.Now let's compare Kimbrel's record to Kershaw's. Kershaw had his second 20-win season for his career this year. His ERA has never been lower than Kimbrel's, and is 2.48 for his career (2.28, 2.53, 1.83, 1.77). His average strikeout total per nine innings was 10.8 last year, boosting his career totals to 9.4. His K-to-walk ratio was better than Kimbrel's last year (7.71), but for his career, it's 3.41.Kershaw's statistics are good numbers, of course. And Kershaw's been rewarded with two Cy Young Awards and a second-place finish. But they aren't as good as Kimbrel's. No doubt, Dodger fans will argue that Kershaw has to throw more innings. Braves fans could counter that Kimbrel can't afford to make a mistake, where every inning is a pressure inning. Dodger fans can talk about how Kershaw has pitched deeper for his team into the playoffs (with disappointing results for the Dodger starter in the postseason) while Kimbrel backers can point out that Kershaw often pitches with a stronger batting lineup.We could play these games forever. But when it comes to comparable statistics, like ERA, strikeouts per nine innings and per walk, Kimbrel has the edge. And yet Kimbrel can't seem to get a top-three finish for the Cy Young Award.How does Kimbrel compare to other relief pitchers who have won the Cy Young Award? I'll let you judge.  Bruce Sutter won the Cy Young Award in 1979. He had 37 saves, an ERA of 2.22, a strikeout per nine inning statistic of 9.8, and a K-to-walk ratio of 3.44.Steve Bedrosian of the Philadelphia Phillies got the Cy Young Award in 1987. He had 40 saves, an ERA of 2.83, a strikeout per nine inning statistic of 7.5, and a K-to-walk ratio of 2.64.In 1984, Willie Hernandez of the Detroit Tigers captured the Cy Young Award. He had 32 saves, an ERA of 1.92, a strikeout per nine inning statistic of 7.2, and a K-to-walk ratio of 3.11. San Diego Padres' reliever Mark Davis took the Cy Young Award home in 1988. He had 44 saves, an ERA of 1.85, a strikeout per nine inning statistic of 8.9, and a K-to-walk ratio of 2.97.There's Eric Gagne of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who was awarded the Cy Young honor in 2003. He had 55 saves, an ERA of 1.20, a strikeout per nine inning statistic of 15, and a K-to-walk ratio of 6.85. Only Gagne's numbers on this list are comparable to Kimbrel's. Statistics from Dennis Eckersley and Rollie Fingers are also similar to Kimbrel's and they were honored with a Cy Young Award.So why is Kimbrel not receiving the same consideration as other pitchers? There are a few reasons. Kimbrel has had to compete with some good starting pitchers for these awards, like Kershaw and Adam Wainwright. Atlanta may be a small market team, but that didn't keep John Smoltz, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and Chipper Jones from getting awards. Some might feel that evidence suggesting Eric Gagne used steroids is hurting all relievers, but they haven't stopped giving the award to starters because of Roger Clemens, have they? It's time to use comparable statistics to give relief pitchers a chance to the win the award, or create an award like the old ""Rolaids Relief Award.""  John A.

As Republicans pat themselves on the back for their performance among Latino voters in midterm elections, the figures serve as a reminder that the GOP still has a long way to go when it comes to recruiting Latinos into the party. The imbalance is most pronounced in the upper houses of state legislatures across the country, with Democrats accounting for 88 percent of Hispanic state senators. Only nine Latino state senators belong to the Republican Party, compared to the Democrats’ 65. By contrast, Democrats hold 76 percent of the lower house seats in state legislatures occupied by Latinos, with 173, compared to 54 for Republicans. There is, however, some good news for Republicans. Ten new conservative Latinos were elected to the lower houses of state legislatures on Tuesday, while Hispanic Democrats lost six of those seats. One Latino Democrat will take a state senate seat next year, however. No new Republican Latinos were elected to office in a state senate. The RNC trumpeted its performance in the midterm elections, noting that the national exit poll conducted by Edison Research on behalf of a group of major news organizations showed the GOP had performed better than expected in several key races. The poll also found, however, that some 63 percent of Latino voters backed Democrats in U.S. House races -- a six-point jump from the last midterm elections in 2010. Latino Decisions, a pollster that specializes in surveying the Hispanic electorate, disputes the exit polling data. A Latino Decisions poll of 4,200 Hispanic voters conducted in the five days leading up to the election showed that Republicans fared much worse among Hispanics than the exit poll indicated. "

Democrat John McCrositie became the first openly gay man elected to Idaho’s House of Representatives, and became only the second openly gay, lesbian or bisexual elected official in the state, after openly lesbian Nicole LeFavour had been elected in 2008 and served until 2012.“I had to decide for myself,” the longtime schoolteacher said in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress, regarding the moment when the opportunity presented itself for him to run in Boise’s 16th district. “I want to represent education in our state legislature. But the reality of life is, I’m a gay man. And people are going to find out that I’m gay. I can either run with integrity and let people know, ‘Yep I’m gay.’ Or I can lose that integrity.”It’s a bit of a transition for McCrostie, going from teaching band, choir and guitar to middle and high school students, to the public life of a politician. But education and the economy were issues he was becoming passionate about politically, he said, and he knew he could also use the platform to speak out for LGBT equality. He’s been doing just that since he announced in 2013 that he’d be running for the Democratic primary, which he won last May. McCrostie publicly supported the ""Add the Words"" protests that rocked the legislature earlier this year, when many were arrested in acts of civil disobedience while demanding the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity to Idaho’s human rights protections. And he criticized Governor Butch Otter as the GOP governor vowed to fight the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that brought marriage equality to Idaho last month. McCrostie didn’t have a moment when he “came out” as a budding politician, he said, but rather has been out all along. “The people in the community know me,” he said. “They know my partner, currently my husband, as of December of last year, according to Hawaii standards -- according to Idaho standards, as of October 15, once the Supreme Court denied the second stay [of the 9th Circuit's ruling].”Still, his being gay, refreshingly, has been such a non-issue in his Boise race that even some gay people didn’t always know he was gay.“I even had a fundraiser recently at our local gay bar, and I was talking to some folks and they said, ‘You know John, I’m so happy to have a candidate that is so gay-friendly,’” he recounted. “And I told him right there, ‘You know, I’m about as gay-friendly as they come.

Sunday's strikes appeared to come from territory held by both government and rebel forces.Ukraine's military said its standoff with the Russian-backed separatists in the east had intensified in the past week, which saw the rebels swear in new leaders after elections the government says violated the terms of the truce pact.Ukraine has accused Russia of sending a column of 32 tanks and truckloads of troops into the country's east to support the pro-Russian rebels in recent days. Moscow has long denied its troops operate in east Ukraine, although many have died there.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which includes Russia and Ukraine as well as the United States and NATO countries, operates in East Ukraine with the blessing of all sides and is widely seen as neutral.Its statement that it spotted an unidentified armored column in rebel territory helps support Kiev's position that Moscow has been sending in reinforcements to protect separatist enclaves the Kremlin now refers to as ""New Russia.""

The media service for the military operation said two policemen and one civilian had died in shelling on Sunday.OSCE Chairman Didier Burkhalter said on Saturday he was ""very concerned about a resurgence of violence in the eastern regions of Ukraine and about activities leading to more fragility instead of further stabilization of the situation.""He urged both sides to stick to the agreements reached in a 12-point ceasefire deal on Sept. 5. TENSIONSLysenko said Ukraine's military believes Russia could stir up tension to provide grounds to ""send in so-called Russian peace-keeping units.""The United States and European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine since March, when Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Moscow has since backed separatists who rose up in east Ukraine, while denying the presence of its own troops.The sanctions have hurt Russia's economy, already facing a fall in the price for its oil exports, and have helped drive a crash in the value of the Russian rouble.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Saturday the United States and Russia had agreed to exchange information about the situation on the Russia-Ukraine border due to some ""some disagreements about some of the facts on the ground.""Although Russia blames the crisis on Kiev and the West, NATO has said it has overwhelming evidence that Russia has aided the rebels militarily in the conflict.On Saturday, investigative journalists published a report on the downing of a Malaysian airplane over rebel territory in July in which 298 people died.The Bellingcat report said there was ""strong evidence indicating that the Russian military provided separatists in eastern Ukraine with the Buk missile"" believed to have shot down the plane.

San Jacinto College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-jackson-tinkering_b_6128498.html,"Painter Robert C. Jackson likes things... lots of them.

Jackson likes things... lots of them. His current show at Gallery Henoch, Tinkering with Reality, is populated by cosmologies of pancakes, donuts, goldfish bowls, apples, oreos, vintage soda crates, and postcards. There is a philosophical vibe to the show -- Thiebaud meets Hegel? -- and some spiritual connotations as well: Jackson's donuts multiply like the Boddhisatvas in a Buddhist scroll, suggesting multiple realities. Funny, inquisitive and just a tad moralistic, Jackson's still lifes are conundrums that blend Jackson's affection for Americana and the entire history of the still life genre. Jackson also likes books, and he is the proprietor/editor of a striking new book that features interviews with 20 representational painters, himself included. It is titled Behind the Easel: The Unique Voices of 20 Contemporary Representational Painters and you have to wonder: where did Jackson find the time to put it together? You would think that painting kept him busy enough...I recently interviewed Robert C. Jackson and asked him about his background, his ideas, and his new book. Robert Jackson: Photo by Ned JacksonJohn Seed in Conversation with Robert JacksonTell me about how you transitioned from being an electrical engineer and assistant pastor to a full-time artist.I started painting during the last semester of my senior year at college and knew from that point on I wanted this newly found love as my career. Having an engineering job lined up I was certain I would quit to be an artist one day. I found after five years I was so stir crazy to be an artist that I spoke to the pastor of my church and told him I planned to quit my job to go for it. To my surprise he asked if I would make a detour and quit to work at his church. After five years I once again became stir crazy about becoming an artist and quit the ministry. The pastor this time said he always knew that day would come. To a certain extent the decision was always blind faith, one never could make a full-time living with part-time work. I always knew I had to jump in feet first.Lure, Oil on linen, 40 x 30 inches  Have you been characterized as a ""Pop"" artist? If so, does that annoy you?   Honestly, I haven't been too concerned about labels. What's that silly expression, ""call me whatever you want, as long as you call me?"" There's some truth to that. I love what I do and hope there are some that get it. From interviews and what I've read, Wayne Thiebaud struggled against being called Pop as he saw himself as more of a painter than the Pop movement. That being the case, I strongly identify with being a painter myself, but if Pop means that my work is speaking to a contemporary society I don't mind that.More Donuts, Oil on linen, 60 x 48 inches  You seem to like things... LOTS of things. Is your art, to some degree, about glut?   I do tend to think of my art in different groupings; food fights, wall of crates, dilemmas, quests for immortality, art dialogs, and some I call excess paintings (and of course some mix these). Funny to see your word ""glut"" as I suppose that is a more bombastic form and possibly dark side of excess! But yes, they are about abundance, desire, want, collecting, amassing, and the extreme. Art Project, Oil on linen, 48 x 48 inches  How would you describe your personal philosophy?   I'm going to answer this both personally and artistically. Personally, I try to live by grace and would like to think I view others with that in mind and attempt to offer it freely. Of course I am a far cry from being successful at that, but I do believe in believing the best and keeping a non-judgememtal and open spirit.  Artistically, I really feel strongly about a healthy marriage between concept and craft in art. I've even drawn quadrant diagrams thinking this through. Representational painters can fall into the trap of focusing 95 percent of their energy on craft at the expense of concept because well-handled painting is so alluring. Though, a low concept painting can't be salvaged by high craft. So I do spend quite a bunch of time brainstorming and hope it bears fruit. I'd like to have concepts that are enriching and challenging.Icons, Oil on linen, 40 x 30 inches  I'm betting that you collect art and objects: am I correct?   I am definitely a creature of habit and routine. Ever since I was a little boy, every Jefferson Nickel I get as change, I check the date and if it is earlier than 1964 (the year I was born) I save it. They aren't worth anything at all, it's just something I enjoy for a reason I can't even explain myself. I own all the crates that show up in my paintings. My art book collection has gotten a little out of hand. And yes, I love to collect and look at other artist's artwork. Very little of my own artwork hangs in my house. Mostly contemporaries that make me stand in shock and awe.Come One, Come All, Oil on linen, 48 x 60 inchesYour art strikes me as aiming to appeal broadly: to ""art"" people and everyone else. Is making a wide connection one of your aims?   YES! Many artists say their ultimate goal is to paint only for themselves. Of course I admire that and embrace much of that, but I see myself as wanting to create work that speaks to people. Otherwise why show it in public? I love revealing my inner dialog in a way in which others can in turn continue the dialog when viewing the work. I find it a rewarding challenge to create work that speaks AND can be heard.Behind the Easel: The Unique Voices of 20 Contemporary Representational Painters by Robert C.

What motivated you?   Really it's my belief that this book needed to be done and it wasn't going to happen unless I did it and so I created the book I wished I had. I'm pretty passionate about art and artists and wanted to provide another platform for these artists to have their voices heard. I have 2 copies of John Arthur's Realists at Work that was published in 1983. For those that have not seen the book, artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Janet Fish, and Jack Beal were interviewed with images of their work intermixed. I'll often grab a copy at lunch and reread one of the artist's interviews. It's not a curator or critic talking about the work, it's the artists themselves and I love that. But in the ensuing 30 years plenty of artists have come onto the block and a book of this type with representation painters hasn't been done again. In tackling the same general idea, I wanted the images much larger and the questions directed more about their creative processes as opposed to the technical but that book was somewhat of an initial impetus.The Thinker, Oil on linen, 48 x 72 inchesHow did you choose the artists in Behind the Easel?  This was really hard for me as there are tons and tons of talented artists out there and the last thing I wanted to do was exclude people. I respect anyone who has chosen to make this their life's path. However, I knew I didn't want an encyclopedia or ""who's who"" with a single picture for everyone, rather I wanted a somewhat intense and respectful look at a grouping of artists. My goal was to have about 12 pages per artist and reproduce them larger than I had seen any of them reproduced in a publication before. Simple math, and keeping the book to around 250 pages, limited me to about 20 artists. After much consideration, I set up 2 constraints. Firstly, I wanted artists that had caused me to drop my own brush and give up my own work to see what they were doing (and it takes me a lot to make me want to leave my easel). I've gone to their shows and dog-eared their catalogs. Secondly, I wanted artists who were identifiable enough that from across a room that I knew who did the painting without having to run up and read the nametag. Which explains the subtitle of the book, ""The Unique Voices of 20 Representational Painters""Pop Florals, Oil on linen, 40 x 30 inchesAre you ever reticent about using humor in your work?  I actually find it an incredibly challenging pursuit. Nothing is as awful as a stale pun or a one-trick pony. To create a laugh or smile that visits again and again is difficult. To a certain extent it is a balancing act to push it right to the edge without falling. But when all is said and done, if my work brings a little joy to someone's journey I find that pretty darn satisfying.  What do your children think of your art?   I have a very close family. My children are 22 (wow, 23 this month - Happy Birthday Becca!), 19, and 10 and I couldn't have bigger fans than these three.Pancakes, Oil on linen, 48 x 12 inchesRobert Jackson: Tinkering With RealityNovember 6-29, 2014Gallery Henoch  555 W 25th St, NYC"

Thousands perished as high winds and massive rains leveled Leyte, Samar provinces and other areas. Food and water shortages quickly followed after the storm hit. Four million people had lost their homes in an instant. In the city of Tacloban 90 percent of buildings were damaged or destroyed. The numbers tell of the scope of destruction. They do not tell of the personal loss many families feel. A service this weekend was held at a mass grave site in Tacloban to mourn those who passed in the storm. Elizabeth Tromans of Catholic Relief Services attended the mass. People placed flowers and white doves were released. The priests of Tacloban and the Archbishop of Palo led the prayers.Tromans overheard a city official say the mourning process could now begin for families. There has not been really any time to mourn because so much work had to be done to clear the rubble. Typhoon Haiyan (or Yolanda) was one of the largest disasters in history. The people of the Philippines have made significant progress recovering in just a short amount of time.How were they able to do this? Help from the international community poured in after the disaster. The UN World Food Programme and UNICEF rushed emergency food aid and water to the displaced. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) was one of the charities that came to the rescue with emergency shelters and supplies. CRS has done this before in the Philippines. In fact, this was one of the first countries they assisted when the agency got its start during World War II. This aid, fueled by donations from overseas, supported a very determined population that was ready to do the heavy lifting of reconstruction. Tromans explains, After seeing the devastation, many including myself wondered how people could rebuild when they had lost everything. Where do you even begin? Not only have people come back to rebuild, but they have strengthened their bonds with their neighbors. Neighbors will share building materials, share their labor, and share their food to help other families during times of need.While there has been a dramatic turnaround in the Philippines, the recovery is far from over. Farmers lost their lands during the storm. This critical sector of the economy has not recovered. Around half a million people still live in makeshift shelters. Hunger is still a crisis facing the Philippines. With agriculture sustaining heavy losses this will continue to be a threat to the population. CRS is planning a 3-5 year reconstruction effort focusing on shelter, living supplies, water, sanitation and hygiene, debris clearing and income recovery. They have provided seeds to help farmers start growing again. The journey to recovery still has miles to go in the Philippines. International aid is still needed. Whether or not reconstruction is ultimately successful can only be determined by the people of the Philippines. Tromans says that characteristic we can definitely count on. The community spirit (""bayanihan"") is what will make the Philippines a stronger nation in the midst of tragedy."

Despite this notable exception, the Federal Republic of Germany has proved for nearly seventy years, that reflecting on a dark past can form a cornerstone of peace and stability. Reflecting now presents an opportunity for the world's fourth largest economy to promote moderation within, and between, immigrant and host populations. Given extremism raging from the Middle East to Eastern Europe, seldom has the world needed such a model more than now. The first blow to tolerance and moderation in Germany came as an uncontrollable irony of history, on the very day the Berlin Wall fell. ""Did East Germany have to open the border on November 9th?"" fumed my West Berlin friend, Johann, as we met days later near the Heinrich-Heine-Strasse checkpoint in the middle of Berlin. On November 9th, 1938, he reminded me, the Third Reich had staged a massive anti-Semitic pogrom, Kristallnacht, foreshadowing the Holocaust. ""Now, each year, as the Germans celebrate the fall of the Wall,"" Johann pronounced, ""Kristallnacht will be forgotten -- and with it, Germany's tolerance of foreigners.""Pedestrians glance at the broken windows of a Jewish owned shop in Berlin after the attacks of Kristallnacht, November 1938. (Universal History Archive/Getty Images)My first inkling that Johann and the German left sensed the unbridled nationalism that would soon engulf Germany came two months later in West Berlin, when a drunken East German, proclaiming, ""Germany for the Germans!"" attacked Mahmud Azhar, a defenseless Pakistani doctoral student. When Azhar died six weeks later, not only was the suspect not indicted, but no national outcry emerged, nor did the news provoke a mass protest in West Berlin.Chancellor Kohl remained notably silent about the subsequent rise in far right attacks, which in 1990 killed an estimated seven people, four of them foreigners. Except for sustained warnings by the Green Party, the far left media, and select mainstream reporters, Germany stood by as the violence festered for two critical years.Kohl and his cabinet, dominated by his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, focused instead on brokering an historic unification treaty. This required persuading East Germans to favor absorption into the Federal Republic, then winning broad support for Kohl's rapid unification plan in the all-German election. Kohl squandered an opportunity, choosing to galvanize German national aspirations without tempering German nationalism.This pattern continued in 1991, when, fresh from its electoral victory, the Kohl administration placed a powder keg under the nation's simmering nationalist tensions. First, attempting to spark a swift transition to capitalism, the government transferred 30 percent of the East German workforce into complete unemployment, subsidized part-time work, or jobs training programs within a year.Then the Kohl Administration indifferently or cynically lit a match. Conservatives had long urged the limitation of Germany's constitutional asylum law, especially since many of the rising number of non-German refugees, they complained, were fleeing economic instability, not persecution. Now, implementing concessions exacted from East Germany during unification negotiations, the administration deployed one fifth of all foreign asylum seekers into the imploding economies of eastern Germany.Attacks on asylum homes predictably intensified in the East, then in the West. Five foreigners died in less than six months, from November of 1990 to April of 1991. The ruling party reacted by intensifying calls to limit the constitutional right of asylum, which they claimed would quell the xenophobic unrest, a message embraced by CDU voters and increasingly echoed even by center-left officials.In mid-September, the Bild-Zeitung joined the chorus, running a flurry of alarmist articles in its massive 4.5 million-circulation tabloid, trumpeting, ""We can no longer cope with the onslaught,"" ""Who should pay?"" ""How long can it last?""Late that month, a Ghanaian refugee burned to death in an arson attack on an asylum home in western Germany. A mob in the eastern town of Hoyerswerda began attacking foreigners and their accommodations around the clock with bricks and Molotov cocktails. When Saxony's CDU interior minister refused to send a significant police reinforcement, the attackers grew more brazen.A man peers through a broken window of a Hoyerswerda asylum home on the first day of a week of racist violence waged against the town's foreigners in 1991. (Photo by Rainer Weisflog)After five days of personal assaults and broken glass, over 200 of Hoyerswerda's foreigners, including many Africans and Asians, were evacuated. For the first time since the Third Reich, a group of Germans publicly boasted that they had made their town ""foreigner-free.""Germany's interior minister condemned the attacks, but reiterated that only limiting the number of asylum seekers would stop the violence. Such a message did not exactly discourage far right hooligans. According to police, nearly 1,000 fire bombings subsequently erupted against asylum homes on and around October 3rd, the first anniversary of German unification. Racist attacks rose an estimated eightfold to tenfold in 1991 compared to the previous year; by one count, to 2,368.Though vigilant, and sometimes boldly protective of foreigners, Germany's protest-prone left reserved its mass demonstrations in 1990 and 1991 for foreign affairs, turning out in far greater numbers at that time against the US-led coalition seeking to eject Iraq from Kuwait than against the rise in xenophobic attacks in Germany.Chancellor Kohl didn't strongly condemn the upsurge of racist violence until a late August, 1992 TV interview. Though Germany's figurehead president, Richard von Weiszaecker, condemned the attacks at a large Berlin demonstration on November 8th that year, the Chancellor, the nation's top elected official, never addressed the crowd, which was protesting his goal of limiting the asylum law. Though several massive demonstrations followed, it was too late to stop what had become a time of terror for many foreigners. The annual death toll from far right attacks that year more than tripled, to twenty-seven, with roughly half of the victims foreigners.The administration's leadership failure lay not in wanting to moderate the annual number of asylum seekers, but in using foreign asylum seekers as a scapegoat to do so. The consequences of this strategy soon again become chillingly clear: Days after Germany's parliament passed legislation restricting the constitutional right of asylum, in May of 1993, neo-Nazi youths set fire to a home of Turkish residents in the western town of Solingen, killing five people, including a four-year-old girl.Germany has since tightened prison sentences for racist violence, established a national holiday commemorating the Third Reich's victims, and installed a powerful Holocaust memorial in Berlin. But though xenophobic attacks in Germany have significantly declined since the 1990s, 2013's tally, 473, still exceeds pre-unification levels, and represents a 20 percent rise over 2012.Demonstrators from the group ""Hooligans against Salafists,"" who are known to be violent, march through the city during a demonstration in Cologne, Germany, 26 October 2014. Some 1500 hooligans from various soccer club fan group announced a rally to demonstrate against Islamic radicals. (CAROLINE SEIDEL/dpa)Granted, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders in her CDU-led government recently displayed strong leadership by joining the nation's top church leaders to unequivocally condemn an upsurge of anti-Semitic slurs in Germany triggered by the Gaza War between Israel and Hamas.But she must swiftly do more, and hopefully with more success than from 1991 to 1994, when she served the Kohl Administration as Federal Minister for Women and Youth, during the worst period of racist violence by youths in Germany since the Third Reich. Now, with nearly 7,000 members, the jihadist Salafist movement has undergone exponential growth in Germany. At the other end of the spectrum, the nation's nearly 10,000 violent neo-Nazis hope to gain adherents by exploiting fears over Muslim fundamentalism: Almost 5,000 right wing radicals recently staged a violent anti-Salafist demonstration in Cologne, wounding nearly fifty police, a potential test for more large scale activities.Coming of age under East Germany's dictatorship gives Chancellor Merkel unique credentials to resoundingly condemn both totalitarian Salafists and neo-Nazis, which could appeal to the moderate instincts of both immigrants and German natives. Merkel should also support increased funding for social programs that steer youth away from far right extremism, a supplement the government has promised (but not yet honored) after revelations surfaced of a wave of poorly investigated neo-Nazi murders that left nine foreign shopkeepers dead from 2000 to 2007.Germany and all countries can cultivate moderation and tolerance by funding programs that unite members of immigrant and host populations to collaborate on key projects in schools, communities, and in professional training programs.Finally, Chancellor Merkel should adopt inclusive messaging to promote the political center on all sides: That by building strong personal bonds with native speakers, foreign residents can integrate into German society without necessarily assimilating.Not only can the world's political leaders learn from the breakdown of moderation after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Understanding past human rights abuses can help us all: to see our potential for greater tolerance, to build rapport with those different than ourselves, and perhaps someday, instead of looking the other way from an instance of persecution unfolding before our eyes, inspire us to protect the inalienable rights of at least a single human being.____________Tim Stone's articles on Germany have appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the Economist.
