0,POLITICS,John Kasich Predicts A Contested Republican Convention,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kasich-contested-republican-convention_us_56dc51f5e4b03a405678f33d,The Ohio governor charts out a plan to stop Trump -- and convince kids that politics is cool.,2016-03-06,Ohio Gov. John Kasich thinks his best chance to win the Republican nomination is in a convention fight.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dc59a71e0000c60070f579.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The GOP primary could end in a contested convention this summer, Ohio Gov. John Kasich predicted Sunday.The Republican candidate, who's running at a distant fourth place in national polls, laid out the challenging math for any of Donald Trump's rivals hoping to win outright -- but predicted that Trump would also fall short of clinching the nomination.""No one is going to have the numbers,"" he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. ""I would have to win 68 percent of the remaining contests, OK, 68 percent of the remaining delegates. Marco [Rubio] would have to win like 64. Ted [Cruz] would have to win like 60. Donald Trump's going to fall short. This is the way it's going.""""Now, if Trump, you know, wins all the rest of these things, he'll go to the convention with the right numbers. But if he doesn't have the right numbers, then we're in a multi-ballot convention,"" Kasich continued. ""Is there anything else to be expected with the way things have gone this year?""The Ohio governor made a similar prediction Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity that a convention showdown was likely.“It has to be done fairly,” he said. “You have to do it right, you can’t have a bunch of people in smoke-filled rooms. My only fear of a convention is that these connected interests would dominate.”Kasich once again took a stab at painting himself as an outsider on Sunday, denouncing the idea of letting ""a bunch of Washington insiders pick the nominee,"" and claiming that he'd have no chance because ""they don't like me.""But he gamely went on to sell the prospect of a contested convention as an exciting civics lesson, rather than a sign of Republican disarray.""Think about how much education our kids are going to get about the way in which we pick a president,"" he said, arguing that kids are ""spending their time, you know, looking at some of these Hollywood stars. There's nothing wrong with that. But now they're going to spend more time thinking about how we pick a president.""While the possibility of a contested convention seems to surface during every presidential election, they're far more rare in practice -- although this year could prove the exception. Historically, having to cast multiple convention ballots doesn't augur well for a party's chances in the general election.Also speaking on ABC, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus downplayed the notion, saying it was ""premature"" to discuss the possibility of a convention fight.""I just don't see that happening,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean it's impossible, it just means that you don't know what next week is going to bring, or the week after, or a month from now. I would say that if we have an interview in a month and it's still some sort of tied scenario, then I think people start talking about it more clearly."""

Ted Cruz (Texas) was restored late Saturday night.The networks called an early win for Trump on Saturday, but as the votes came in, there seemed to be a sudden turnaround.The Associated Press’ initial declaration of a Trump victory was largely based on absentee ballots that had come in earlier in the day, The Washington Post's Philip Bump reported. With those votes counted, Trump had 48 percent, Cruz had 23 percent and Rubio had around 20 percent. But as the precinct votes continued to come in, the momentum shifted in favor of Cruz. Trump’s 25-point lead narrowed to 4 points within an hour. The results could indicate that voters changed their minds leading up to Saturday’s election, Bump noted. It’s also possible that Cruz was able to drive more voters to the polls in the final day.Previously: Business mogul Donald Trump took an early lead in the Louisiana Republican primary Saturday, and the networks called it early for him. But we're witnessing a stunning turnaround as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) closes in on Trump's margin. Follow along live at the Louisiana Secretary of State's website here.Louisiana's delegate rules dictate each of the six districts will award three delegates proportionally, with no minimum threshold for candidates to be awarded delegates. The remaining 28 statewide delegates are also awarded proportionally, but candidates have to surpass a 20 percent threshold to be eligible for those delegates.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had a good night Saturday if you look at the number of states he won. He beat Hillary Clinton in the Kansas and Nebraska caucuses, while Clinton pulled out a win in the Louisiana primary.But Clinton actually came out ahead in the delegate count, with 55 delegates to Sanders' 47. And while Sanders has a good shot at winning the Maine caucuses on Sunday, he needs to start winning bigger -- and in bigger states -- to close the gap with her. Both Clinton and Sanders are already looking ahead not only to Michigan's primary on Tuesday, but the delegate-rich date of March 15, when Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio will be holding their primaries. These states have diverse Democratic electorates, which bodes well for Clinton. She has done significantly better with communities of color, despite the fact that Sanders has been trying to make inroads. In contrast, the caucus states where Sanders won Saturday are places where the Democratic base has grown smaller in recent years, with older, more conservative Democrats becoming Republicans or independents. That has left a more liberal electorate open to Sanders' message of radical change. They're also states that are predominantly white and rural, and Sanders tends to do best with those voters. Michigan is a state where both Clinton and Sanders' teams believe they have a shot. Clinton made the water crisis in Flint a focus of her campaign early on, and she has the endorsement of the city's mayor. But Sanders sees an opening in this state. People in Michigan, and Detroit specifically, know better than perhaps anyone else the effects of the recession and the changing economy. Those voters may be more receptive to Sanders' core message of economic inequality. And it gives Sanders a chance to test his campaign with black voters outside of the South. ""I think in Michigan, she's still ahead. She's had a lead for awhile,"" Sanders' Senior Strategist Tad Devine acknowledged Saturday night on MSNBC. ""But like many other states, we are closing very very fast. And I hope by the time we get to Tuesday, we can close in Michigan as well."" The candidates will get a chance to present themselves to Michigan voters Sunday night, for the Democratic debate in Flint. On the Democratic side, states award their delegates proportionally based on the share of votes each candidate gets (provided they get at least 15 percent). So a loss in a close race could still pay off, and a big win is better than a small one. Sanders won big in Kansas -- 23 delegates to Clinton's 10 -- and Clinton did significantly better in the more populous state of Louisiana, getting 35 delegates compared to 10 for Sanders. In Nebraska, the race was closer, so Sanders received 14 delegates, but Clinton wasn't far behind at 10.The Clinton campaign played down expectations for this weekend's caucuses in advance, acknowledging that they were better territory for Sanders. Their strategy was to basically minimize their losses so that the senator didn't run up too many delegates. Campaign manager Robby Mook said they were staying focused on steadily amassing delegates in the long run.""We have no doubt that as long as Sen. Sanders remains in the primary, he will continue to win elections along the way, but it will make little difference to Hillary’s pledged delegate lead. ... [O]ver the upcoming weeks, we intend to steadily add to Hillary Clinton’s already sizeable lead in delegates, and as we do, it will become harder and harder mathematically for Sen. Sanders to ever catch up,"" Mook wrote in a memo to reporters this week. Essentially, Sanders has to start winning states outright in order to rack up enough delegates to catch up. Devine admitted Saturday that Clinton has a ""big advantage"" with delegates at this point, but he said they still have ""plenty of time"" to close the gap. ""We're going to need to beat her in big states, and I think we can,"" he said, pointing to Washington state and Wisconsin, and even New York, which holds its primary on April 19 and holds a big prize of 291 delegates.""I think we'll have a big showdown in New York. And I know that's her home state and she represented it in the Senate, but we do not concede New York to Hillary Clinton,"" Devine said on MSNBC.

But he wants you to know his hands are yuuuge.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump wants a cage match.""I want Ted one-on-one,"" Trump said of Ted Cruz, calling on Marco Rubio to drop out of the presidential race after another dismal performance. He joked that Rubio -- or ""little Marco,"" if you prefer -- will have a harder time than normal calling Saturday night a win since that loser didn't even hit 20 percent in any of the four states holding GOP primary contests.Trump was speaking at one of his many campaign innovations, as he eschewed his victory speech for a rambling press conference that TV networks carried live.""I would love to take a few questions from these dishonest people,"" Trump said to the press. Then, to one guy in the media, ""I love you as a reporter.""He had a zinger for Cruz's win in Maine, saying that he should've done well there since it's so close to Canada. (Trump has repeatedly questioned Cruz's eligibility to run based on his Canadian birth.)And really, why is Rubio still here? ""It's time for Marco to clean the deck,"" he said, adding, ""I say that respectfully.""Back to Cruz. Trump argued it would be ""easy"" to beat him because the Texas senator has no chance in states like New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and California. He warned the GOP against an independent bid against him, predicting it would get Hillary Clinton elected to the White House.""I love the Republican party. I love the conservatives,"" he offered. ""I love a lot of people.""Another thought on Cruz's campaign: ""Ted is moving along okay.""Wrapping up his victory speech, Trump agreed to take some questions. ""I've taken more questions from reporters than almost any human being that's ever lived,"" he said to one questioner. ""I mean, give me a break.""Trump took a minute to comment on the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia. ""A great man,"" he said several times. He seemed miffed that part of the reason establishment Republicans don't want him to win the nomination is because they don't trust him to pick a court replacement.""We're going to appoint a conservative, great judge,"" Trump said. ""Something that will make people in the Republican Party very happy.""For the protesters at his rallies, some of whom have been beaten up and dragged out, Trump said they should feel safe. ""We treat them very gently. You know, ten years ago they would have been treated very differently. Not by me, that's just the way life is,"" he said. ""We treat them very, very gently.""A reporter asked Trump about degrading the political process by talking about his penis -- a reference to Rubio commenting last week that Trump has small hands and possibly matching small junk. The crowd booed. ""I didn't bring it up. Someone else said Donald Trump has small hands,"" he said.""I hit a ball 280 yards. Stand up!"" Trump said to a golf pro in the audience. ""Do I hit good? Do I hit it long? Is Trump strong?""""I simply held up the hands,"" he added. ""They're fairly large, actually.""Trump wrapped up his speech and headed to Fox News for a live interview. There, he offered a major concession on how he would operate as president.""I will certainly be willing to live under the law,"" Trump said.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
7,POLITICS,Can Sleep Deprivation Explain Donald Trump's Behavior?,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sleep-deprivation_us_56d5d020e4b03260bf78343a,Not that it would be an excuse.,2016-03-06,"A man sleeps before a campaign event for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Jan. 23, 2016, in Pella, Iowa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d5e73e1e0000870070321d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has a troubled relationship with facts. But long before he became the Republican front-runner, he had a troubled relationship with sleep.Trump’s sleep deprivation isn’t some dark secret that opposition researchers have had to surface. He’s been bragging about it for years.He boasted about getting by on just three or four hours of sleep a night last fall -- about half the amount recommended for most adults.""You know, I'm not a big sleeper, I like three hours, four hours, I toss, I turn, I beep-de-beep, I want to find out what's going on,"" Trump said at a November rally in Springfield, Illinois.In a recent op-ed for The New York Times, Timothy Egan suggested a ""unified theory"" to explain the candidate's behavior by way of his chronic fatigue.Against the backdrop of Trump’s poor judgment, mood swings, occasional amnesia and rabble-rousing, fatigue may seem to be the least of Trump's problems. But as Egan noted, a lack of sleep negatively impacts many aspects of health and behavior that are important for anyone -- especially someone in a position of power. Sleep deprivation has been linked to memory problems, cognitive dysfunction, moodiness, compromised decision-making, impulsive behavior and paranoia. ""The negative consequences of sleep deprivation in humans are well established,"" Dr. Patrick Fuller, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School, told The Huffington Post, ""with features like vigilance, attention, working memory, and higher cognitive abilities being compromised first.""Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his current sleep habits, or whether he finds just a few hours a night to be sufficient.The real estate mogul is history's latest example of a prominent man flaunting his lack of shuteye. Labor historian Alan Derickson places Trump in a long tradition of macho sleeplessness that includes Thomas Edison and Winston Churchill. Edison even once wrote that ""there is really no reason why men should go to bed at all.""In his book Dangerously Sleepy: Overworked Americans and the Cult of Manly Wakefulness, Derickson explains how starting with the Industrial Revolution, the realities of worker exhaustion took a back seat to economic success. ""Resisting sleep became a challenge of masculine strength,"" he writes.No one embodies the ""highly masculine executive style"" of the last century more than Donald Trump, suggests Derickson. And ever since he first appeared on the national scene in the 1980s, the ""flamboyant self-promoter cultivated an image of superhuman energy and drive.""In his 2004 book Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, Trump claimed to sleep only from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m., in order to gain a competitive advantage in his dealings. He advised readers, “Don’t sleep any more than you have to. ... No matter how brilliant you are, there’s not enough time in the day.""But the idea of ""overcoming"" sleep is a bit of throwback nonsense that is, incidentally, typical of Trump's presentation at large. His sleep-deprivation brags go hand-in-hand with his nativism and xenophobia -- all are artifacts of American intellectual history.Politicians on the other side admittedly are not getting a full night's sleep either. Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama both concede that they'd like to get more. But at least they agree that a lack of sleep is not helping.One major caveat of Fuller's ""sleep-deprived Trump"" hypothesis is that self-reports of any health behavior are notoriously unreliable. Coming from such a well-documented liar as Trump, who's to say he's telling the truth this time? Reuters reported that Trump prefers to sleep in his own bed in his ""marble-and-gold-furnished Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan"" almost every night.Is someone so particular about sleep really scraping by on four hours a night? Perhaps Trump's sleep debt is as much spin as other parts of his campaign.But if it is true that Trump consistently sleeps less than his body needs, Fuller says, ""it is probably fair to say that he is not operating at his peak cognitive levels.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. "

Hogan, for May 11.Among the groups challenging the Maryland law are local gun rights groups, private businesses and individual gun owners. A coalition of 20-plus states and organizations such as the National Rifle Association have also filed legal briefs supporting the challengers. The original decision didn't strike Maryland's gun-control regulations. Instead, it instructed a lower court weighing their legality to view them through a standard known as ""strict scrutiny"" -- a stringent test courts use when analyzing laws that may trample on rights secured by the Constitution.The ruling was seen as significant because other courts considering similar firearm bans -- such as those passed in New York and Connecticut in the wake of the Newtown massacre -- have upheld the bans under lesser standards.The Supreme Court, for its part, has refused to step into the fray to clarify what's the proper constitutional test governing these laws.In December, the justices turned away a case from Illinois that upheld a ban similar to Maryland's -- a move that drew a fiery dissent from Justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia.At least until the 4th Circuit decides the case again, it looks like there won't be a need for the high court to determine if these laws deserve a harder look."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) won the Maine Republican caucus, scoring a major upset victory against Donald Trump after a dominant win in Kansas.While there was no recent polling in advance of the caucus, Trump enjoyed some advantages in the state. Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) endorsed Trump on Feb. 27, just a week after he reportedly tried to mobilize colleagues around publishing an open letter condemning him.Trump also responded to Mitt Romney’s attacks against him at a rally in Portland on Thursday, drawing cheers from the crowd as he called Romney a “failed candidate.”But by Saturday afternoon, there were early reports from Maine’s caucus sites that Cruz was taking the lead.The victory in Maine shows that Cruz is capable of winning outside of Southern and Western states, with their concentration of evangelical and very conservative voters -- the groups whose support Cruz had most relied on until Saturday. It will no doubt add weight to his oft-repeated claims that he is the only Republican candidate capable of defeating Trump.There are signs that the so-called establishment Republicans may be reconsidering their preference for Sen.

""It was exciting and startling, actually, how well they were preserved.""Scientists believe the chameleon-like creature was an infant when it was trapped in a gush of sticky resin while darting through a tropical forest in what is now Myanmar, in Southeast Asia.The creature's entire body, including its eyes and colorful scales, is unusually well-preserved, Stanley said. The other reptiles trapped in the amber, including a gecko and an arctic lizard, were also largely intact.Small reptiles have delicate bodies and typically deteriorate quickly, he said. Being encased in solid amber helped to lock the specimen together.Stanley and other researchers used high-resolution digital X-ray technology to examine the creatures and estimate the age of the amber without breaking it.The discovery will help researchers learn more about the ""lost ecosystem, the lost world"" to which the creatures belonged, Stanley said, and it may help researchers learn more about the creatures' modern relatives.""It's kind of a missing link,"" Stanley said.

This was also claimed by the ultra-hardline Sunni group that controls vast swathes of territory in Iraq and in Syria.The escalation in Islamic State bombings suggests that Iraqi government forces are being stretched thin after their recent gains against the group in the western and northern provinces.Responsibility for the bombing in Hilla, 117 kilometres (73 miles) south of Baghdad, was claimed in a posting on the website of the Amaq news agency, which supports Islamic State.""A martyr's operation with a truck bomb hit the Babylon Ruins checkpoint at the entrance of the city of Hilla, killing and wounding dozens,"" the statement on the Amaq website said.Hilla is the capital of Babylon province, a predominantly Shi'ite region with some Sunnis.""It's the largest bombing in the province to date,"" Falah al-Radhi, the head of the provincial security committee, told Reuters.

Her skull was fractured after being hit repeatedly with a hard object.A federal judge identified Fournier as ""a person of interest"" in McLain's homicide when he was sentenced in 2009 to 6-1/2 years in prison for possession of child pornography, the Bangor Daily News reported.Fournier also has at least three burglary convictions between 1979 and 1984, the paper reported.Fournier is being held without bail in the Penobscot County Jail in Bangor.

Even though I previously had performed my loyal and patriotic duty since 1972, this year was different. The charade and parade of fools running for president made me question the need to vote. How do I select the least horrible candidate?I believed the voting process was important to our Republic, but it was naive to think every vote counted. One candidate already had attracted large numbers of Super Delegates, those voters who were free to endorse anyone they want for nomination regardless of the voting result. Also, special-interest groups carry so much weight they can tip the scales for or against a candidate. And every election cycle brings allegations of fraud from both sides as ballots are cast multiple times, often by dead or fictitious people. What's the use?A recent event caused me to reconsider my boycott of the elections. One evening I was working at my desk and I heard a noise in the kitchen so went to investigate. A woman sat at the table and stared at me. Too frightened to run, I stared back and mumbled, ""Who are you?""""I'm Susan Anthony,"" she said. ""And I'm very disappointed in you.""""Would that be Susan with a 'B' Anthony?"" I asked.""Yes. You should have known by the vintage dress and white collar. Do you like my hair up in a bun like this? I could never wear it down like you do.""""It looks lovely. But how did you get in my kitchen. Aren't you dead?""""Yes, I died in 1906. That was 14 years before women got the right to vote in this country.""I felt chagrined. I knew she was a pioneer suffragette who championed women's rights in a time when women were uneducated, couldn't own property, and had few individual rights. She proceeded to tell me about her arrest for voting in the 1872 presidential election. She wasn't allowed to speak during her trial, and the jury of all men convicted her. The judge fined her $100, which she never paid.""I was arrested for voting,"" she said. ""What makes you so special that you don't vote?""I stammered an excuse and finally admitted I had no excuse. ""Would you like a glass of wine?"" I asked, hoping to break the tension.""Don't you remember I was involved in the temperance movement? I was raised a strict Quaker, and I fought against the sale of alcohol. In those days, the husband controlled everything, the finances, the house, the children, and the wife. If he got drunk every night, the wife had no power to leave. She couldn't get a divorce, and if they separated, the man usually got custody of the children and she was left destitute.""""I can't imagine how oppressive that must have been,"" I said. ""What prompted your vocal advocacy?""""I was a teacher and I tried to speak at the New York State Teachers' Association meeting in 1853, but the men said it wasn't proper for a woman to speak in public. They debated 30 minutes and finally relinquished. Can you imagine?""I thought about how relatively free women are today in comparison, even though there are cloisters of fanatical societies that continue to belittle females. The fact that I could own property, have an education, travel alone, vote, run for office, and make independent decisions was due to the advocacy of brave women from the past.Another vision appeared and a woman sat down at the table. At this point, I didn't care if Susan B. Anthony didn't drink alcohol, I poured a glass of wine. After all, it was my kitchen and I was talking with two ghosts. I welcomed the woman and asked for her story.""I'm Alice Paul,"" she said. ""In 1917, a group of women in Virginia was arrested, beaten, and thrown in jail for protesting for the right to vote. I was in that group and spent five weeks in prison. I went on a hunger strike so they locked me in solitary confinement in a psychiatric ward and force-fed me raw eggs through a tube down my throat. But I never gave up.""""I don't know how to repay both of you for your sacrifices,"" I said. ""Life must have been so difficult.""""We were only two of thousands who marched in the streets, attended Congressional meetings, wrote amendments, fought with our patriarchal families, and encouraged other women. We were ridiculed, tormented, beaten, and chained to iron bars in jail cells. But we never gave up,"" said Paul. ""Your rights today are the result of our fearless actions.""I raised my glass and toasted them. They raised empty hands to wave goodbye, smiled faintly, and began to fade away.""I promise to vote!"" I called after them.""We know,"" they said in unison. ""Or, we'll be back.""I decided that I would vote. Which candidate to choose remained unclear, but I would vote. Susan and Alice sacrificed too much for me to stay home in the kitchen.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Emotions provide the cue to act when a problem is big enough to see, yet still small enough to solve. By understanding your emotions, you can move adeptly through your current challenges and prevent future ones.Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ""something"" in each of us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships.Emotional Intelligence Can Save Your LifeWhen you stuff your feelings, they quickly build into the uncomfortable sensations of tension, stress, and anxiety. Unaddressed emotions strain the mind and body. Your emotional intelligence skills help make stress more manageable by enabling you to spot and tackle tough situations before things escalate.Stress, anxiety, and depression suppress the immune system, creating a vulnerability to everything from the common cold to cancer. The potency of your immune system is tied to your emotional state via neuropeptides: complex chemicals that act as messengers between the mind and body. When your mind is flooded with tension or distress, it signals the body to decrease energy directed towards fighting disease. This change increases your vulnerability to an attack.Emotional intelligence reduces the perception of stress in response to trying situations. Emotional intelligence skills strengthen your brain's ability to cope with emotional distress. This resilience keeps your immune system strong and protects you from disease.Bringing It All TogetherIt's nice to know that working on your EQ can have benefits in some of the most important areas of your life.

This weekend, the first movie he's written, ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,"" again finds him in the company of frequent collaborator Tina Fey. In ""Foxtrot,"" Fey plays Kim Barker (Baker in the movie), whose 2011 memoir The Taliban Shuffle recounted her experiences as an unfulfilled TV journalist who hesitantly accepts a role as a war correspondent in the Middle East. The Huffington Post sat down with Carlock a few weeks after CBS green-lit his first multi-cam sitcom (another Fey union) since ""Joey"" crashed and burned in 2006. We talked to Carlock about his approach to the light drama of ""Foxtrot"" and what he thinks about the state of the multi-cam landscape.I know studios are struggling to market adult dramedies right now, but the trailers for this movie are very misleading. The actual movie is so much better!I think what’s great is that Paramount is committed to making movies like this. These movies don’t get made as much as they did when I was a kid, and not just war comedies, which is a thing, but anything where you have to pay attention. I think it’s probably a hard thing to figure out how to market because I wonder if, just personally, as a viewer and as a writer, people are used to receiving these kinds of movies and whether they have the shorthand to understand what this is. It is dark and light, and it is more naturalistic than just a comedy. It’s not a rom-com, but it has those elements. That’s what I loved about writing it: It’s about people living in this situation, and people, wherever they are, do funny things. They fall in love, they make mistakes, they have work problems -- even if a work problem could be getting killed.That’s a pretty big work problem.Yeah, that’s a pretty big one. And how do you cope with that? What kind of behavior does that bring out? Because, at the end of the day, people are people. I loved writing it because Kim’s book is funny but also sad and frustrating and all of the things that I think we’ve experienced being in the Middle East for well more than a decade. So to answer your question, I hope people show up because I really like it and I think it was a hard movie to name for those same reasons. You don’t want to tell people it’s a hilarious comedy, you don’t want to tell people it’s a dark drama, you don’t want it to feel like it’s political.Is that why you switched from ""The Taliban Shuffle"" to ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot""? Yeah, and that wasn’t my decision, but it also did reference something specific in the book that was her dual life between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and this movie is all about Afghanistan. To that end, it didn’t mean anything anymore. So that was the first place where that title fell apart. But also, yeah, having Taliban in the title would suggest something preachier.With a movie like this, you have to make a decision whether to lean in to the violent political background or to create a plot that's almost an antidote to that landscape?Right, I think you’re touching on something that I was very conscious of, which was there are things that are inevitably political in their nature, even if the movie doesn’t take a side. My first draft, I think, was around 300 pages. I was like, “Well, OK.” There were threads that just had to go away and there were things where I just felt like I was saying the same thing 100 times. My hope was that this individual person’s experience could be hopeful, that she could come out of it intact or better having had the experience. That was sort of as close to a point as I wanted to get. I hope the sweetness isn’t cloying. I was conscious of, “OK, how do you tell an Afghanistan story that isn’t simply, 'Oh my God, we’re still there and we went to Iraq."" I wanted to stay focused on Tina's character, and I wanted to be able to suggest that, in spite of the frustrations and the hardships, she was able to return to some version of her life. And there's so much low-hanging fruit to reach for when it comes to depicting cultural divides. I have met and talked to a lot of Afghans, and they have a sense of humor. They're people. And it’s very easy to either ignoble or demonize the other, especially when it’s a world where you’ve been at war for 15 years. There was a scene that didn’t make the movie that Kim came and told me about that wasn’t in the book, where she and some friends were at a café and she was complaining that she hadn’t learned any of the Dari swear words and made [Christopher Abbott's character] teach her. You never do that -- you’re talking to a woman, teaching her all these terrible words. He was just laughing and she was laughing, and the table next to them was offended. We shot a version of that scene, which I think was at least good on a character-actor standpoint, to have that interaction of, “Oh OK, we’ve broken though this barrier.”I think people find a lot of humor wherever they go. Whatever situation they’re in, funny things happen. They use humor to express themselves, even if it’s gallows humor. And certainly the Afghan characters couldn’t be separate from that. I think it was very important that he not just be the person quoting poetry to her.After running ""30 Rock"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"" how easy is it to hand over a script and let someone else take the reins?You know, that’s a great question. First of all, those guys are great and I just trusted them implicitly. I had Tina in there, too! It was a little weird, and yet at the same time, when I got used to it, it was sort of freeing. I would wake up in the morning and go, “Well, maybe I’ll have to adjust some dialogue or something today,” but I don’t have to have a meeting with props and I don’t have to think about making the day. I can just kind of watch it. And sometimes you’d be sitting there watching it and saying, “Why are they doing that? Oh OK, they’re going to get it around the other side,” or whatever it is. You can’t turn that brain off, and it took a little getting used to. Some days you’re just blowing up a car. So you say, “Yeah, I’ll drive out to the desert and watch a car get blown up.” It’s interesting that you are going the multi-cam route next. It seems to antithetical to your other recent shows. Are you excited for the transition?When you have that three-joke-a-page or five-joke-a-page rhythm, like we do on our TV shows, it’s hard to make adjustments in TV. You know, my first shows, “SNL” and then “Friends” -- and “Dana Carvey” before that -- were in front of an audience. “SNL,” of course, is live. That’s what the “L” stands for.Oh, OK!Yeah, people aren’t aware. And I love those show nights, both on “SNL” and on “Friends.” That’s a place where, when a joke doesn’t work for an audience, you’re pitching live and you’re doing the scene again and getting different jokes. When that experience can be communicated, I think you have, even at home, a different relationship with those characters when it works. We did a multi-cam last year with a guy named Matt Hubbard, too. I think Tina, coming from improv, knows that feeling of doing a show. If you can get that to communicate through the screen, it’s a different and, in its way, a better experience. It’s like communicating what it’s like to be at a play or another live performance. That’s a long-winded way of saying I’m a believer in multi-cam. I can’t say there’s a ton that I watch right now, so our hope is to do something that is worth watching.So can you do ""30 Rock"" with an audience? Can you keep it edgy and multi-cam at the same time?I don’t think it can be that, exactly. Even when we did the live “30 Rock” episodes, they couldn’t really be “30 Rock.” You don’t have the tools visually and you don’t have the same room to tell a story and to do jokes. Inevitably, it is a little different. But can you do it different in a way that our seven fans will follow us? We're going to try.""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is now in theaters. This interview has been edited and condensed."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56da0fc1150000ad000b13fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scotch lovers, you'd better stock up: There's a global shortage of age-labeled single malt Scotch whisky, and prices are going up.CNN Money reports that because Scotches are legally required to age for three years, demand is now outpacing supply. It gets worse: The shortage could last 10 to 15 years.Prices for vintage Scotch whisky are surging as a result. For example, bottles of 30-year Black Bowmore from 1964 are currently selling for around $10,000 online.A major reason for the whisky shortage is Asia's huge interest in the drink, which distillers didn't anticipate. One-fifth of all exported Scotch goes to Asia, according to CNN Money. The current Scotch shortage is not unlike the bourbon shortage that gave people a fright a few years ago, when brands such as Buffalo Trace realized they hadn't made enough barrels eight to 20 years earlier to meet current demand. In 2013, Makers Mark riled its consumers by announcing it would water down its bourbon recipe to lengthen its limited stock.Fortunately, major Scotch distilleries such as Macallan, Oban and Highland Park are already ramping up their production to meet consumers' appetites. So we're not headed for a world without Scotch any time soon -- just one with more expensive Scotch."

I’ll continue to be an activist, but I figured the next road for solution was changing things from the inside.""Cori Bush, another activist-turned politician, spoke at the rally about being tear-gassed in Ferguson and the importance of standing against social injustice.“For some reason, my round hips and my dark skin says that I must make less money than my counterparts and I don’t understand that,” said the single mother, ordained pastor and nurse, who is running as a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate.She wants to “eradicate the school-to-prison pipeline” and said that her platform echoes much of Sanders’. Black Lives Matter activists have interrupted several presidential candidate campaign events, including one for Sanders, and a protester interrupted Clinton during a private fundraising party last week.“Can I talk and maybe you can listen,” Clinton said to her, before the activist was escorted out. By contrast, the activists who spoke at Sanders’ rally on Friday were well-received.Alisha Sonnier, the president of Tribe X, the grassroots activist organization born out of the Ferguson protests, compared Clinton to an old pair of shoes that are loved, but can give calluses, as she urged voters at the rally to canvass for Sanders.“I never thought that someone would invite me -- someone who’s well-known for shutting things down and for being involved in Ferguson. But to me, it’s a step toward the right direction,” the 20-year-old student told HuffPost after her speech in front of thousands of cheering Sanders supporters.Bush said that it was significant that he had three African American people speak before he came up. ""All three of us were Ferguson activists. That said a lot more to me because it’s the new civil rights movement,” she said.Rachel Germann, 32, of Sycamore Hills, Missouri, who also attended Friday’s rally, said although she isn’t black, the Black Lives Matter movement is the one of the most important parts of Sanders’ presidential platform to her. “I live close to Ferguson and it’s a big deal to me,” she said. The Missouri and Illinois presidential primary election is on Tuesday, March 15.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the state congressional district that Franks is running for. It is the 78th, not the 79th. The story also included a mistranscription of Cori Bush's remarks. She said ""round hips,"" not ""brown lips."""

This is the first installment of “Meet the North,” a series that ventures into the lives of some of the 4 million people who call the Arctic home.It was below freezing inside the derelict mining building that looked down over Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Coal dust powdered the wooden floor. The corrugated metal walls enclosed a control room, ceiling tracks and tangles of steel. This building used to collect cable cars full of coal and send them down to the harbor. It was abandoned long ago, but for one night in June – this night – it becomes a concert hall jammed with locals dressed in down jackets and brightly coloured winter hats. Coal – the world’s most maligned fossil fuel and the foundation of this community – was about to take center stage.The crowd cheered and whistled as 16 Norwegian men filed into the room. They wore matching white caps and navy blue coveralls with “Store Norske Mandskor” (Great Northern Men’s Choir) silkscreened on their breast pockets. Each man boasted a custom belt buckle showing a hammer and pick – the traditional tools of miners. But the outfits belied their true occupations; this group included the world’s northernmost architect and the town pastor, as well as the leaders of all the political parties in town.The conductor wore white gloves and a purple down jacket beneath his costume. With a flash of his hands, the men breathed in and opened their mouths. Their voices poured over the crowd and across the bright fjord.Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, midway between Europe and the North Pole. Almost 2,200 of Svalbard’s 2,700 inhabitants live in Longyearbyen. They’re mostly Norwegians, as Norway has sovereignty over the archipelago, but the town was named after an American, John Munro Longyear, who started coal mining in 1906. The Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani (the Great Northern Spitsbergen Coal Company) bought Longyear’s enterprise 100 years ago, and it’s still the only mining company in town.In the 1980s and 1990s, Longyearbyen evolved from a company town, which was expensive to maintain, into a community that also relies on tourism and a university campus. In 2015, the coal company employed almost 500 people on the island of Spitsbergen and said that 40 percent of the population still relied on the mines through direct and indirect jobs.The company inspired the choir, which has existed on and off for a century. Elisabeth Larsen, who sells Store Norske’s coal to international buyers, tipped me off about the show.I met Larsen on her coffee break outside head office, across the street from Norway’s only coalfired power plant. Its fuel comes from Mine 7, 16km (10 miles) from town, that produced 70,000 metric tons of coal in 2015. The largest mines are in Svea, 60km (37 miles) away, where they have extracted between 1 and 2 million metric tons of coal annually for the last few years. Last year, $64 million worth of coal was shipped to Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom.“Nobody likes coal,” Larsen said, “but nobody wants to accept the fact that we don’t have anything to replace it with.” At 78ºN, energy security is paramount. Heat is life.For Longyearbyen, coal is a Catch-22. It might be dirty, but it’s local. It comes from down the street, and if it runs out, the community must rely on diesel shipped a long, long way. Coal built this community, but times are changing. Coal mines are an anomaly in Norway, which is known for its hydropower, and a growing number of townspeople recognise that coal is dirty to burn and expensive to extract.I expected that differing views about coal and energy would create tension in such a small community, and I asked Larsen how people deal with that.“Oh, it’s not difficult between people.” she responded.I hesitated and then replied: “I don’t believe you.”Larsen laughed. “Go to the concert on Saturday night, and you’ll see what I mean.”The air in the old building seemed to warm even as the evening grew colder. The music alternated from heartfelt ballads to fun and silliness, and each tune rang with precise harmony. Whether they were singing about the tundra or covering “Sixteen Tons” by Kentucky’s Merle Travis, these men had joy on their faces – and it was contagious.They sang and even danced. They led us in half-time stretches. Their voices resonated with the steel of that stark building. And then we went to the pub.Over beers and pizza and between spontaneous bursts of song, I got to know the men a little better: the heads of business development and real estate for the mine, a schoolteacher and the head of the trade union. Also, political leaders from the Labor Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative Party and – the newest act in town – Miljopartiet De Gronne, the Green Party.I recognized the Green Party leader, Espen Rotevatn, as the conductor in white gloves. Part of his political mission is to end coal mining on Svalbard forever; yet in his spare time he dons a miner’s outfit and leads his group to harmony.Sveinung Thesen, the concert MC and an employee of the mining company, explained it best: ""Your political beliefs and what you culturally relate to are two different things. I perfectly understand a person can be skeptical toward mining but still be proud of the heritage we have here in Longyearbyen.""Everyone around the table understands that the mines still greatly affect their community. Aleksander Askeland, who works in business development at Store Norske, explained that if the coal mines closed 300–400 jobs would quickly disappear. “This is bad for everybody,"" he said. ""You can’t turn this off in a day.”Even Rotevatn voted in support of a $70 million loan from the Norwegian government to keep the mine going in the short term. “It seems wrong to me that we do this [coal mining] in the Arctic, in a very special environment ... but a vote against the loan was a vote against Longyearbyen,” he said. Keeping the mine going for now buys time to build a longer-term solution, which may or may not include coal.Almost a year later, big changes have come. For 2017, Store Norske has decided to double production at Mine 7 and stop production in Svea for three years with the hope that coal prices will rebound. If they do not, Store Norske will close those mines permanently. For now, the company will cut the 300–400 jobs that Aleksund referenced, and by next year the company will have only 95 employees. Elisabeth will still be one of them.In the meantime, energy diversification is on the table: for example, a test project for solar energy is running in Svea. On the political front, Rotevatn and one other member became Svalbard’s first representatives of the Green Party last fall.Choral singing is all about a common purpose. In this case, a love of Longyearbyen that includes its past and future. Coal may be leaving center stage, but nobody in the choir underestimates its importance – regardless of their politics.Politics are unavoidable in a small town, and the Store Norske Mandskor knows when they must be sidelined for the good of community. When I asked Rotevatn what happens when politics meet music, he simply said, “Nothing. We sing, and we drink beer.”It’s a simple formula, but it seems to be working.

This week, Cerchio and his team released a new video showing a mother with her calf.It's only in 2003 that Omura’s whales were recognized as a distinct species, when Japanese researchers analyzed the DNA of nine whales that had been caught decades earlier. Before that analysis, scientists believed Omura’s whales were a pygmy variety of Bryde’s whales, another species that lives in tropical waters.Omura’s whales are baleen whales -- instead of teeth, they have a stiff, sieve-like filtering system inside their mouths called baleen. Baleen whales open their mouths all the way to take water into their mouths, then push the water out through the baleen, leaving behind small prey like krill for the whales to eat.So few Omura’s whales have been observed in the wild that scientists don’t know much about their behavior, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation group. But the whales that have been spotted are typically alone or in pairs."

She has chosen ""to live in peace and witness war—to experience the worst in people but to remember the beauty,"" as she writes in En el instante preciso (At That Precise Moment: A Photographer's Life of Love and War), published in Spanish by Roca Editorial.Warner Brothers has recently secured film rights to the memoir. Jennifer Lawrence will play the photojournalist, and Steven Spielberg is slated to direct.The photojournalist worked as a conflict reporter in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Congo, among other war zones. She has repeatedly photographed women in conflict areas, such as Sudan, Pakistan. Addario's photo series have also captured communities beyond war including: transgender sex workers in New York, monks in Bhutan and women running for a Miss India beauty pageant.Addario -- who handles words just as well as she does a camera -- didn't write a navel-gazing memoir. Instead, she provides an analysis of international politics as she captures her struggle to reconcile her career as a war photographer with the call of motherhood and family.In an essay published by the New York Times Magazine, Addario recalled feeling uneasy about the thought that having children would force her to turn down assignments. “I was paralyzed by the limitations I assumed motherhood would impose on my mobility and my career,” she wrote. She has also said that becoming a mother has changed her approach to photography. “When I became a mother, I realized so much more about the mothers I’ve photographed and that love that is inexplicable for someone that doesn’t have a child,” she told TIME Magazine.
