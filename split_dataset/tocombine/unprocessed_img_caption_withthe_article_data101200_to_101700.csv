In putting together such a list, I always think about sardonic  folk singer Tom Lehrer's definitive album about 1965: ""That was the Year That Was"" including his ballad about pollution. Well, 2014 was certainly the ""Year That Was"" for parks and open space, with many cities finding places to build new parks by creatively reusing abandoned or underperforming infrastructure as parks, and with record levels of new public and private investment in some states and cities.To begin with the money, 2014 saw Americans deliver landslide victories for parks and conservation funding measures in a kind of ""ticket-splitting"" that seemed to run contrary to more partisan votes for officials. During the year, more than $30 billion was approved in conservation bonds to park district votes. In Florida, voters approved 3-to-1 a measure to use real estate transfer fees for open space and clean water purposes, with up to $18 billion in spending over two decades. New Jersey voters kept the ""garden"" in their ""Garden State"" moniker by approving a $2.8 billion environmental bond, and Seattle voters created a new Park District with taxing authority to pay for new parks and better maintenance at existing parks. Noted Ernest Cook, Senior Vice President and Conservation Director at The Trust for Public Land (which helped lead the advocacy work in Florida and other states), ""at a time when political gridlock seems to capture all the headlines, these election results highlight a critically important point: Americans of all political stripes care deeply about the fundamental value of protecting our land and water.""It wasn't just voters who showed they like parks. Private donors stepped up, too. In particular, there were two extraordinary private gifts for public parks. In Tulsa, Okla., the George Kaiser Family Foundation committed $350 million to build and run a new 100-acre park on the banks of the Arkansas River. It will be called a ""A Gathering Place for Tulsa,"" and is being designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, a firm that also designed the still-new Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City and The 606 park being built along nearly three miles of old elevated railroad tracks in Chicago. The 606, which will open next year, will get nearly half its funding from private sources, including $5 million from Exelon. Rendering of a section of A Gathering Place for Tulsa Park, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by Michael Van Valkenburgh AssociatesIn New York City, the largest private gift for a public park was announced just a few weeks ago, as media businessman Barry Diller made a $130 million commitment to build a 2.6-acre park and performance space to replace a collapsing pier in NYC's Hudson River Park.  Rendering of proposed park at Pier 55 in Hudson River Park, New York City by Heatherwick Studio and Mathews NielsenThis record gift comes a little over a year after the San Francisco-based S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation made a $25 million grant -- the largest cash gift in national parks history -- to connect the Presidio with Crissy Field in Golden Gate National Recreation Area. According to a soon-to-be released report by The Trust for Public Land's Center for City Park Excellence, at least $160 million a year is raised by park conservancies, the non-profit arms of parks around the nation. Rendering of competition-wining design for Presidio Parklands in San Francisco by James Corner Field Operations and EHDDAside from large financial support, the year saw two other trends gather strength. The first, the conversion of abandoned rail lines to linear parks and greenways, saw major progress in cities across the country, including completion of the High Line in Manhattan and continued work on the 606 and the Atlanta Beltline. In the New York borough of Queens, plans were revealed for a new 3.5 mile linear park known as the QueensWay, and similar plans are in various stages of development in the Seattle area, Philadelphia and New Orleans.The second trend is the movement to create spaces out of the interstate highways which blight many downtowns. In May, San Diego opened its new 12-acre Waterfront Park, turning an old parking area into what has been called the city's largest new urban park since 1915. Seattle is in the midst of replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct, an aging double-deck freeway with a huge new waterfront park and landscaped boulevard, designed by James Corner Field Operations. New York City is considering a park known as BQGreen, designed by dlandstudio, atop the trenched Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Rendering of proposed BQGreen deck park in Southside Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY, by dlandstudioThese ""freeway cap"" parks seem to be of particular interest in Southern California: there are two (see one, and two) proposed parks over the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles. In addition, the nearby cities of Glendale and Santa Monica are studying using freeway overpasses for parks. St. Louis is looking at building a park over I-44 to connect the downtown with the Gateway Arch and Pittsburgh is considering an overpass park atop a downtown stretch of I-579. Denver is looking to create an overpass park downtown atop I-70.With more and more people moving back into cities, urban leaders are increasingly looking for these kinds of creative projects to build the parks those new residents say they want. It is clear that parks -- with their stacked layers of benefits that include climate change resilience and sustainability, public health, community cohesion and improved quality of life -- are key components of livable, sustainable cities. The appreciation of the essential role parks play in cities -- and in our lives -- will only accelerate in the years ahead."

Technically hired as an “independent contractor,” Ballard received little support for the work he was doing. Delivering about 150 Amazon packages a day might have earned him, on average, $225.But that money was spread thin covering his expenses.Per Jamieson’s story:Ballard had to purchase the cargo van he drives for work. He doesn't get reimbursed for the wear and tear he puts on it; for the gasoline he pours into it on a near-daily basis; for the auto insurance he needs to carry; or for the parking tickets he inevitably racks up downtown. He doesn't even get reimbursed for the LaserShip uniform he's obliged to purchase and wear.""It's like they want us to be employees, but they don't want to pay for it,"" the 45-year-old Ballard said at the time.Amazon has little incentive to change this system. Here’s why it works out so well for the retail company:For starters, a delivery company using independent contractors avoids paying payroll or unemployment taxes on its drivers, as well as workers' compensation insurance -- never mind basic workplace benefits like health coverage and a 401(k). Such companies also aren't obliged to pay workers overtime under federal law, meaning no time and a half when the delivery day stretches into a 12-hour shift. And since they pay drivers on a per-delivery basis, they don't owe them anything for non-delivery work, like loading the van at the warehouse before hitting the road, a task that can take up to two hours.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Make no mistake, Amazon has reason to celebrate success right now. In October, the company faced its biggest quarterly loss in 14 years, leading some profit-hungry investors and pundits to dub CEO Jeff Bezos a “grinch.” Sales growth, especially during the retail industry’s coveted holiday season, is one way of proving Amazon is on the right track. But during a time of year when everyone, delivery drivers included, traditionally celebrates with family, it may be worth looking into the real costs of this same-day delivery service. "

But the Ukrainian government has repeatedly warned of a build-up of Russian forces on the peninsula.State rail firm Ukrzaliznytsia said cargo trains would be suspended from Friday, while passenger routes would gradually cease running over the weekend and on Monday.""In order to ensure the safety of passengers ... (the railway) will cut the route of trains to Crimea off at Novooleksiyvka and Kherson,"" it said in a statement, referring to two towns on the Ukrainian mainland near Crimea.The transport authorities did not say how long the bus and train suspensions would last.Russia's foreign relations ministry declined to comment on Friday.Mired in a power crisis, Ukraine has also had to ration electricity to all regions, including Crimea.On Friday the energy ministry temporarily cut off power supplies to Crimea for the second time in a week because the peninsula had failed to curb consumption as required. Supplies resumed later in the day. (Additional reporting by Polina Devitt in Moscow; Editing by Pravin Char)"

The group's claim could not be verified.Neither Microsoft nor Sony offered explanations for the connectivity problems, though both services expected heavy use as consumers who received the devices for Christmas tried to log on all at once.Extra network traffic on Xbox from users downloading ""The Interview"" may also have exacerbated connectivity problems for Microsoft.The film also was available to U.S. online viewers through Google Inc's Google Play and YouTube Movie, as well as on a Sony website, www.seetheinterview.com. It can be seen in Canada on the Sony site and Google Canada's website.A Sony spokeswoman on Thursday said she had no figures on the number of downloads so far, and the studio was not expected to have box office numbers from theaters before Friday morning.The audience at the first screening of the film in New York City, at the Cinema Village in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, remained silent during a scene showing the death of Kim Jong Un in the downing of his helicopter.Matt Rosenzweig, 60, of Manhattan, said the moments that drew the most applause had to do with the idea of acting against censorship rather than animosity toward North Korea.RAUCOUS APPLAUSEAlthough Cinema Village manager Lee Peterson said the New York Police Department planned to post officers outside the theater, there was no visible police presence outside or inside the venue for the first screening.An afternoon screening at the Van Nuys Regency Theaters in the city's San Fernando Valley was two-thirds full and drew a diverse crowd ranging from teens to senior citizens, who laughed loudly throughout at Rogen and Franco's antics.""It was much better than I thought it would be,"" said Carlos Royal, 45, a professor who came with a friend dressed in Santa hats and took selfies for the occasion in front of the theater's Hollywood sign marquis. ""I wanted to support the U.S.""The movie, which is playing in theaters in major metropolitan areas as well as in smaller cities ranging from Bangor, Maine, to Jasper, Indiana, features Rogen and Franco as journalists who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate the North Korean leader.In Asia, online audiences seemed to find the movie tedious.""There is no drama and not much fun,"" said a blogger in South Korea. ""It's all about forced comedy that turns you off. Couldn't they have done a better job making this movie?""Sony decided to release the film after U.S. President Barack Obama, as well as such Hollywood luminaries as George Clooney and Republicans and Democrats in Washington, raised concerns that Hollywood was setting a precedent of self-censorship.The audience in Manhattan exited the theater to a throng of network TV cameras and a crowd of people lined up for the next showing.""It was more serious, the satire, than I was expecting,"" said Simone Reynolds, who saw the film while visiting from London. ""There's a message for America in there too about America's foreign policy.""North Korea has called the film an ""act of war.""Most fans simply called ""The Interview"" a funny movie.Ken Jacowitz, a 54-year-old librarian from the New York borough of Queens, called it ""a funny film made by funny people."" He had a message for North Korea and the hackers: ""You have given this movie whole new lives.""

It's a term and idea frequently referenced in the Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg co-directed film, in which Rogen's character explains, ""It's an attractive spy woman who lures men into doing shit they're not supposed to do.""At the 10 a.m. Christmas Day screening of ""The Interview"" at Cinema Village -- the only theater currently showing the film in Manhattan -- it was hard not to feel like audiences had been honey-potted in some respect. In this case, they were lured into showing up with notions of protecting free speech and and the sexiness of sticking it to the hackers who, last week, dared to evoke the memory of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in their threats.The idea that seeing ""The Interview"" in theaters was important or even patriotic was only amplified by the scene in and around Cinema Village. Many media members (myself included) pounced on moviegoers as they purchased tickets. Inside, theater manager Lee Peterson introduced the comedy by quoting ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee.""""Let freedom ring,"" Peterson said to the crowd of around 100 people. ""No one can tell us what we can or can't see. So enjoy the film.""It's a seductive narrative, mostly because people don't like being told they can't see something --especially by hackers that may or may not be working for a brutal dictatorship in North Korea. It's likely one of the reasons that all of Cinema Village's afternoon screenings are sold out -- even after Sony made the film available to stream online for half the price of a theater ticket. It's all this buzz surrounding the movie, and Sony's flip flop on releasing the film, that was what brought Jacqueline and Anthony Goodling to the movie theater. ""I wanted to come down here and see all the hype around something,"" said Anthony Goodling. ""But, in reality, it's a movie, and for everyone to blow it out of proportion like they did, I just think it's going to be really good and really funny."" Jacqueline, his wife, added that they didn't have any plans to see ""The Interview"" before Sony pulled it from theaters last week, but decided to after it became an issue of free speech. Other theatergoers, such as Karen Shea and her husband, planned to see the film all along, but admitted they came out today due to ""curiosity"" and due to the ""novelty"" of Sony briefly pulling it from theaters. The movie itself is everything you'd expect from a movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco --dick jokes, fart jokes, celebrity cameos and even the delightful integration of language from the Internet's favorite Deranged Sorority Girl Email. It's not exactly ground-breaking stuff, but audiences are at least now able to make the choice to see those dick and fart jokes for themselves.""We live in an area where we have freedom of speech, and can see anything as far as movies and media,"" Jacqueline Goodling said. ""And this was shut down for a period of time, just because of the hacking and because of the fear that we had. That's not what we're about."""

It can be seen in Canada on the Sony site and Google Canada's website.A Sony spokeswoman on Thursday said she had no figures on the number of downloads so far or on how well the movie was doing at the box office.A spokesman for Microsoft also said he had no information yet on downloads and declined to say if the company had taken any special security measures or stepped up customer support.""Of course, it's safe to say holiday season is always a very busy time of year for any consumer electronics company,"" Sean McCarthy, general manager of Microsoft's Xbox Product Services, wrote in an email. ""So we work hard to ensure the stability of our infrastructure when so many consoles are activating for the first time.""RAUCOUS APPLAUSECinema Village manager Lee Peterson, who declined to provide details of security precautions, said the New York Police Department planned to have officers outside the theater. He said he had also heard from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.There was no visible police presence outside or inside the Cinema Village for the first screening.In Los Angeles, where the film drew a sell-out crowd for the 12:30 a.m. showing, people who held cups of warm cider as they waited for the theater to open said they came to show support for freedom of speech and freedom of choice.The movie, which is playing in theaters in major metropolitan areas as well as in smaller cities ranging from Bangor, Maine, to Jasper, Indiana, features Rogen and Franco as journalists who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate the North Korean leader.Sony decided to release the film after U.S. President Barack Obama, as well as such Hollywood luminaries as George Clooney and Republicans and Democrats in Washington, raised concerns that Hollywood was setting a precedent of self-censorship.In Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, where the first screening at 11:45 a.m. PT was only half full, some filmgoers were blunt about their reasons for attending.""You need to stand up for these things,"" said Dennis Lavalle, an acting teacher who came with his daughter. ""And I am not going to let a country that regularly depicts in video the nuclear Armageddon of this country and that's OK, and we can't make a satirical picture about something that is not going to happen.""MOVIE FANS HAPPYThe audience in Manhattan exited the theater to a throng of network TV cameras and a crowd of people lined up for the next showing.""It was more serious, the satire, than I was expecting,"" said Simone Reynolds, who saw the film while visiting from London. ""There's a message for America in there too about America's foreign policy.""North Korea has called the film an ""act of war.""Most fans simply called ""The Interview"" a funny movie.Ken Jacowitz, a 54-year-old librarian from the New York borough of Queens, called it ""a funny film made by funny people."" He had a message for North Korea and the hackers: ""You have given this movie whole new lives.""(Additional reporting by Mary Milliken, Eric Kelsey and Jed Horowitz; Writing by Leslie Adler; Editing by Howard Goller and Steve Orlofsky)"

For the ""way of life"" thus vindicated is addicted to a view of freedom as the right to say and do anything one wants, indifferent to the substance of what is actually being said in freedom's name.Personally, I am repulsed by the prospect of a distributor releasing on Christmas Day a public film depicting the assassination of a living person as something ""funny."" Apart from the fact that such a film is provocative toward a North Korean leadership and culture that already appears fear-saturated and perhaps dangerous, made by producers and evidently actors who think that it is some kind of progressive political act to engage in this kind of provocation, the theme of the film should be seen as offensive and even shocking to anyone with an open heart and a respect for human life. What is funny about depicting the murder of a named individual who is currently alive? And how is it reflective of any spiritual meaning of Christmas to release such a film on a day celebrating the birth of Christ, or to non-Christians, celebrating at the very least family gatherings based upon loving human connection?The entire public discussion of ""The Interview"" has focused not a whit on the actual moral substance of the film and exclusively on the importance of an ideal of free expression, no matter how offensive the expression is. This amoral view of the substance of freedom is reflected not just in relation to ""artistic"" freedom and the First Amendment, but also in relation to the freedom of a ""free market"" that sees workers mainly as factors of production-for- profit rather than beautiful human beings deserving of respect and dignity and that exploits the natural world without regard to beauty of creation and the sacredness of all life through which creation, whatever its wondrous origin, is made manifest . Freedom conceived in this way also embraces, in the name of democracy, a political process that vindicates the ability of billionaires to manipulate the consciousness of a society of isolated and socially separated television-watchers in order to influence their voting patterns.To me, the spiritual-progressive meaning of Christmas is that we human beings should affirm our capacity for love of one another, and that we should aspire to the creation of a world that embodies that loving impulse in all that we do and all that we create. This would mean devoting our moral presence in our time on earth to co-creating a world beyond the present narrow liberal worldview that, while recognizing its importance in having helped to liberate earlier generations from state-sponsored and religion-sponsored bigotry and persecution, today legitimizes a fearful, individualistic culture cut off from the deep, rarely-affirmed longing in each of us to fully recognize one another's sacred and beautiful humanity and our equally powerful longing to bring into being a beloved community in which that capacity for mutual sight is more fully manifested.Of course it is a bad idea for a film distributor to be intimidated into not showing a film because of blackmail or threats. But it is also important not to make a fetish of the form of freedom to the point that we cannot see and respond ethically to the moral substance of what that freedom produces. From that substantive point of view, the decision by Sony to release ""The Interview"" on Christmas Day, and to make such a film in the first place, is deflating and discouraging.And yet... Merry Christmas!"

Apart from the stock footage of The famous march from Selma to Montgomery it's not cinema verite in the style of say The Battle of Algiers. Despite the graphic depictions of violence, it's just too slick; DuVernay's paints her Guernica on Selma's Edmund Pettus bridge and it's almost beautiful. But the strength of the movie lies in its depiction of nonviolence as strategy. ""Our lives are not fully lived until we are ready to die for those we loved,"" King (David Oyelowo) says. He possesses a sculpture of Gandhi, yet it's plain non-violence is as much a weapon as a principle for him. Jim Clark (Stan Houston), the sheriff of Selma is a perfect foil for the protests as Bull Connor was in Birmingham. In Albany, Georgia the sheriff, Laurie Pritchett, had removed the demonstrators on stretchers and that was not what King wanted. It didn't create either sympathy or headlines. Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), making a cameo appearance, tries to employ the idea of another kind of strategy. He'll incite violence in order to make the authorities regard King as the lesser of two evils. It's a form of gamesmanship that King isn't ready to buy. ""I'll be damned if I'm going to let history put me in the same place as the likes of you,"" Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) tells George Wallace (Tim Roth). But it's not surprising to see one of the greatest politicians of the 20th century or all time adding to the chorus of realpolitik that's the movie's recurring leitmotif. Neither the tensions in King's marriage nor his infidelities are glossed over and they in turn are exploited by yet one more power player, J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker)--who unsuccessfully tries to use them to throttle King's charismatic drive. The real march of the movie is towards the passage of the Voting Rights Act of l965 with Lyndon Johnson lamely proclaiming ""we shall overcome."" Andrew Young (Andre Holland), Ralph Abernathy (Colman Domingo), the conflict between John Lewis's (Stephan James) SNCC (Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee) and King's SCLC (South Christian Leadership Conference) are all part of the tableau--which, on the basis of recent headlines, poses the troubling question of whether much has really changed?
