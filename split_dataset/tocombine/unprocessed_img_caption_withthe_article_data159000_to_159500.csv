0,TRAVEL,A Stylish Guide To Manhattan's Greenwich Village And Union Square,"The Purple Passport, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-stylish-guide-to-manhattan-greenwich-village_us_5b9cf8c7e4b03a1dcc83658f,"Greenwich Village and Union Square, two adjacent New York neighborhoods in Manhattan, share the distinction of having colorful political pasts and lively cultural presents.",2013-04-01,2013-03-26-15EastRestaurantbyThePurplePassport.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-03-26-15EastRestaurantbyThePurplePassport.jpg,"Greenwich Village and Union Square, two adjacent New York neighborhoods in Manhattan, share the distinction of having colorful political pasts and lively cultural presents. A visit to both is sure to leave you intellectually enriched, playfully pampered, and especially well fed. The birthplace of the Beat movement in the 1950s, Greenwich Village has today largely sloughed off its folksy, hippie past in favor of trendy restaurants, shopping, and nightlife, and an upscale crowd of residents (many celebs among them) has replaced the beatnik artists. But there is still a boho lilt to these quaint tree-lined streets, especially with the strong presence of nearby New York University.In the heart of it all is historic Washington Square Park, where bohemian types like NYU co-eds, musicians, skateboarders, and street performers now congregate in the same spots that Dylan and Ginsburg once strutted their stuff. If you want to pick up some beat poetry to channel the mood, stop by the Strand Book Store, the sprawling independent book shop famous for its 18 miles of new, used, and rare books.But if you'd rather party, not study, the Village is chockfull of lively music venues, bars, and cafés for a stylish night on the town. The streets are notoriously packed here until the wee hours on weekend evenings, with revelers seeking out gems like The Dove Parlour, an elegant subterranean bar set in a Victorian parlor, and OTTO, an Italian wine bar with a bubbling scene and delicious antipasti courtesy of Mario Batali. Batali has his tomato sauce-stained fingertips all over the Village, in fact, with celeb- and foodie- beloved Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca (three words: pasta tasting menu!) and rustic Italian Lupa Osteria Romana (in which he has a stake) also in the neighborhood. For seasonal American cuisine, head to Blue Hill, with its farm-fresh fare, or Gotham Bar and Grill from notable NYC chef Alfred Portale. For sushi, try under-the-radar Ushiwakamaru.Even if the hippies who used to haunt the Village might balk, it's actually a great place for some beautifying. State-of-the-art lasers and soothing lavender wax take care of all your hirsute needs at Completely Bare, while the bright pink décor at Dashing Diva is sure to perk up any mani/pedi routine.Just north of the Village is Union Square, which has been a rallying point for political activists of all stripes-everyone from union leaders in the 1920s to anti-war protesters in the 1960s to Occupy Wall Streeters in 2011 has made a stand here. But one thing everyone seems to peacefully agree upon is the great food found in these parts. The Union Square Greenmarket is a well-known hub for chefs and eco-warriors who come for the organic and locally grown produce and ready-to-eat treats. Delectable restaurants also abound, including zen-like sushi at 15 East, fresh seafood at Blue Water Grill, and Italian-kissed American fare at Danny Meyer's first Manhattan restaurant, Union Square Café. Also notable for its all-day Irish breakfast and hearty brews is Lillie's, a Victorian-Irish pub.But if you'd like some of those greenmarket herbs on your face, not just in your food, try the Ginseng Herbal Facial by cult facialist Ling Skin Care for serious rejuvenation. Finally, if you must get down to business, check in at biz-friendly W New York - Union Square. Its trendy scene is just like Union Square itself: not too Uptown, not too Downtown.

(AP Photo/Karly Domb Sadof, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfd173c00005b0009f961.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary happened in December, my mom called me and asked, ""Are you going to talk to the kids about it?"" I knew they would find out about it and I planned to talk to them, but before my wife and I could formulate a plan, I heard my daughter from the back seat of the car: ""Dad, what happened in Connecticut?"" Radio is off. ""Where did you see that, honey?"" I asked. ""Instagram,"" she replied. Every day, I stand up and tell Fortune 100 brands that they aren't in control over their messages. Whatever they say or communicate about their brands is free to be picked apart in social media. Why, therefore, I thought my 9-year old-was any different, I have no idea. A quick Google search of the term ""social media and parenting"" returns 295 million results with sources from NPR and Forbes to Facebook and WebMD. However, a lot of that content covers Twitter, Facebook and ""tween"" involvement, not Instagram and not kids younger than 10.Instagram seems innocent enough and that may be the reason why younger kids are flocking to it -- pictures and memes, fun filters and little hearts to like things. When my daughter asked to be on Instagram, we saw it as something she could earn (which she did) and, frankly, it was a way to keep her at bay on texting for a while. She wasn't asking about Facebook or Twitter. Facebook isn't cool for kids (""my parents and grandparents are on it"") and Twitter doesn't seem as exciting -- yet.We laid down only a few ground rules in a way she would understand. First, dad was going to follow her, so anything she posts on Instagram, she has to be comfortable saying to my face or sharing with me in person. Second, if I saw something I thought was inappropriate, it would result in a penalty: I get the iTouch for a couple of days and she'd face an Instagram ban. Finally, she had to have a private profile and I could pop quiz her on her followers anytime I wanted. Anyone she accepted but didn't really know got blocked. ""Somebody from dance class"" was not acceptable.That was all we did and so far, it has worked very well. This was before the great ""iPhone contract"" that went viral a little while ago, but it was in the same spirit.Realistically, as we know, social media isn't always fun and games. What do you do when a 10-year-old writes #f*ckingcool in a post? Do you, as a parent, get involved when a feed you're following through your child looks like a modern day Mean Girls? What will you do the first time you see a Rihanna nip slip picture? Our parents asked themselves the same questions. Should I read her diary? Do I look through his drawers? Instagram is today's digital diary with one big difference -- everyone CAN read it and you can't throw it away.That last sentence is important, so let's say it again. Everyone can read it and you can't throw it away. The day after Sandy Hook, I was on my daughter's feed and I saw that she had posted a picture of the shooter and that she ""hated him."" Her heart was in the right place, but we still deemed it inappropriate. We sat her down and talked to her about remembering the victims and ignoring the shooter and the terrible things he had done. She got it and we took the post down, but for anyone who had seen it, kids or parents, it was too late.The bottom line is that this is new territory for everyone. Don't overthink it, practice common sense:1. Know the password. Always.2. Follow them. If you aren't on Instagram and your kid is, that's a problem. 3. Have a sliding scale of severity that guides how you act. #youstink is kids being kids. #sof*ckingcool is not.4. Don't call another kid out on his/her feed if something they did is inappropriate. If you know the parent, go that route. If not, talk to your kid and see how they react -- do they know it's over the line?5. Let them see your feed and make sure what you post follows the same rules.6. Remind them that what they say can't be taken back. 7. Read #6 again.8. Start to expose them, carefully, to Facebook. They didn't buy Instagram for nothing (actually, they bought it for $1B). They will get more and more alike.Done right, Instagram is a playful communication tool for tweens too old for LeapFrog. They set goals for their number of followers because they are as self-indulgent as we are. They create fun photo challenges and they mostly write nice things about each other. Just remember that the digital revolution we are experiencing puts a tremendous amount of power in the hands of our kids. It can make them seem more ready than they really, truly are. As was told to Spiderman: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" #payattention"

Currently, consumers are instructed to stop smoking when they begin using a nicotine replacement product and to stop using it after 12 weeks. The FDA said on Monday it plans to remove both these restrictions in response to claims by critics that they may cause some smokers to abandon attempts to quit if they have a cigarette while on a replacement therapy. Allowing people to stay on a nicotine replacement for longer than 12 weeks may increase their chance of quitting, they say. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc, whose  nicotine replacement products include Nicorette chewing gum and the NicoDerm skin patch, commended the decision, saying it believes ""this is a positive step to help more smokers quit."" The FDA said nicotine patches and gum were first approved between 1984 and 1992, while nicotine lozenges and mini-lozenges were approved between 2002 and 2009. After reviewing published literature, the agency said, it has determined that the concomitant use of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products ""does not raise significant safety concerns."""

To take that away is to inhibit mothers who only want to do right by their child.",2013-04-01,"Mother holding and feeding newborn baby,rear view.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce42c240000500094dd14.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most people, if you ask them, will say they support breastfeeding, that they believe that it's the best nutrition for babies, natural and good.Ask the same people about breastfeeding in public, however, and the responses shift. Some people will be totally on board with the idea, and other people will balk.To the balkers, I say this. It's not going to make me popular, but it's a statement I have come to believe is true through nine years of lactation, even longer study of lactation, and the experience of thousands of other mothers.If you don't support breastfeeding in public, you don't support breastfeeding.Breastfeeding whenever, wherever a child is hungry is an integral component of breastfeeding success. To take that away is to inhibit mothers who only want to do right by their child. We don't put the same constraints on mothers who bottle feed. To dictate a separate set of rules for a nursing mother and child is discriminatory.Here are some of the examples people give for why women should not nurse in public.""I don't pee or masturbate in public, so why should a woman breastfeed?""This supposes the act of feeding a child is private, or worse, sexual or dirty. But nobody else eats a hamburger under a blanket. We don't ostracize bottle-fed children to another room. Urinating or committing sex acts are considered private, but in no other context but breastfeeding is eating considered something that cannot be viewed.""Just go in another room. Stay home. Nobody wants to see that.""Mothering is already an isolating, exhausting business and to tell a woman that for several hours a day she has to be sequestered is dehumanizing. I have heard women decried for going about their business in the grocery store or at church while nursing their child. These women are multi-tasking. And where no one finds fault with a propped bottle, fault is found here. It's hard enough to be a mother without being told a laundry list of ways and places you can do something as simple as feeding your child without offending the sensitive masses. Especially when seeing something over and over is the best way to normalize it.There are many people who suggest a nursing cover as an acceptable alternative. I invite those to please commit to eating all meals under a blanket. It's hot, it's annoying, and most babies will scream, squall and push the blanket aside. Not exactly discreet.""That's what breast pumps are for."" Breast pumps are for working mothers, babies in the NICU, for nights with the babysitter. They are for mothers who are separated from their children or are struggling to breastfeed a child who cannot latch. They are for donating milk to children who need it. They are for many reasons and not one of them has to do with protecting society from the sight of a nursing woman. For those who think breast pumps have solved the problem of breasts on display and just want the rest of us to get with the program, I have to ask... have you ever pumped?Have you ever watched your nipples stretch out two extra inches, heard the strange squeaking sound, and felt your skin chafe as it's electrically milked? Have you been attached to an apparatus for hours only to yield a few measly ounces? Have you tried to get out the door with a diaper bag stuffed with the right amount of liquid gold on ice?Why impose that on an already tired, stressed mother who is being pulled in eight different directions? When a woman's child needs to be fed there is something called ""let-down"" where the milk physically fills the breasts. If the child is not fed at that time, the breasts receive a signal that milk is not needed. To not be available to your hungry child at the time the milk is needed can adversely affect supply. Obviously if you are feeding your child pumped milk at a restaurant you are also not pumping at this time. Your breasts are becoming engorged, no relief in sight, and you are damaging your supply.""Just bring formula."" No. Same reasons stated above, with the addition that if I wanted to formula feed, I'd formula feed. I chose to breastfeed. That means I have a responsibility to my child to make sure lactation is working. It's a supply and demand game, and when I interrupt that, not only do I make it harder on myself, but I'm also harming my child.Why would anyone do that simply to avoid offending others? Why have we made the act of feeding a child something obscene instead of something necessary? Before pumps, before bottles, when a woman nursed her child, even when she was covered neck to wrists to ankles, it was not considered private. Just necessary.It's still necessary.Related on HuffPost:"

It's seems to me, however, that what's still missing from the conversation is an appreciation for the unique perspective and life skills that moms bring to the workforce.I've interviewed a number of women for my video series ""Moms Change the World,"" and I'm beginning to see that there is something unique that occurs when motherhood becomes the lens from which women approach their work. This new perspective colors what women desire and how they want to express themselves in the workplace. It is much more complex than deciding whether to be a stay-at-home mom of whether to work out of the home. Every mother I've spoken with has related that she wanted work that added meaning and purpose to her life. Most women have been transformed by the experience of becoming parents -- having a child has led them to see their connection with the world differently, and has instilled in them a determination to make it better, however they may. No longer are they simply seeking a paycheck, a title or an office with a view. These women are determined to create purpose through their work, by any means necessary. I recently interviewed Ruth Kennison, founder of Bonaparte Chocolate and an instructor at The Gourmandise School of Sweets and Savories who spoke about her effort to integrate her career and family in ways that many moms might find relatable and even inspirational. In Ruth's view, she didn't see that her career, happiness and family had to be fragmented. She saw the most important aspects of her life like the pieces of a puzzle, connecting to create something whole and unified. Ruth is very much like the other women I speak with -- they are not enticed by what they used to deem to be success. They aren't in search of more money simply for the sake of having more stuff. Ruth made a choice to become a chocolatier because she wanted to share something she loved with her family and community. To further her education, she went abroad to visit bakeries and chocolate shops, but having her son take the trip with her was paramount. Ruth didn't see herself leaving the home for eight hours a day to be in an office and then returning at dinnertime. In her mind, that lifestyle didn't feel like success. She asked herself, ""What else is possible?"" For her, the answer was chocolate. Making chocolate allowed her to follow her passion and include her family in her adventures. Meeting women who are so dedicated to improving their community has been an inspiration to me. Ruth, for example, is keenly aware that the pleasure she derives from her work is then expressed in her family and from there into her community. When her son tells his friends, ""My mom and I made this chocolate,"" his self-esteem and his relationships improve. Ruth acknowledges that though she gained a great deal from her childhood experience (with an at-home mom and a working dad), the model of the traditional, selfless mom had no more resonance for her than the nine-to-five mother glorified in the '70s. She wanted to chart a course that accounted for her needs as well as those of her son and her family. Women today understand that their own happiness and pleasure are an important component of the lives of everyone they touch. This sounds like a simple truth, but women's roles as nurturers -- of the family's income in addition to the family members themselves -- has left many women with little sense there's room for their own fulfillment. Ruth shared that she went deeply within herself to discover her desires and to move past her fears when she decided to become a chocolatier. Her focus was greater than money. The joy in herself and in the energy that she emits to her community has turned out to be priceless. This is an exciting time for moms, because devotion to creating a better world for a living is becoming the new normal. I myself am a mom who works from home. I have learned that it might be a lot easier to ride a ship that's already sailing than it is to build a new one from scratch. But with my own little boat, I can take on whatever cargo I want, and I can use it to deliver whatever the world calls me to bring."

Horizontal shape, copy space",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfca73c00004c0009f939.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Early last Sunday evening, I sat in my home office writing, paying a few bills, and taking inventory of the week ahead. We had just finished dinner as a family; Dave had prepared lamb shanks and the house still smelled rich and savory from a full day of braising. Once the dishwasher was loaded, we all retreated to our own spaces and obligations. Noah was in his room, strumming on his guitar, the riffs playfully ambling down the hallway into earshot. Chase tackled the tail ends of his math homework at the kitchen table. Dave tapped away on his computer, preparing for the coming week of parent-teacher conferences.  I took a quick break from my tasks at hand to check my Twitter feed, where I found a number of people lamenting the existence of Sunday nights. They shared how much they loathed this particular time, sentiments we have all heard and felt many times before.  Sunday nights are the end to an ""all too short"" weekend. Sunday nights are heavy in anticipation of the drudgery, stress, chaos, and toil of the impending work and school week. Come Sunday night, time has run out on all the chores and tasks you promised you would get to at some point, but never did. Sunday nights are all about surrendering to the fact that you do not control your own destiny, because here comes Monday whether you like it or not.  Yup. Roger that.I get it.  But as I sat at my desk with a great deal of empathy for these Sunday-night-tortured Twitter people, I realized that I may have reached a place in my life where this time could easily be my favorite part of the week. It wasn't always this way, but Sunday nights have become a spiritual oasis where my family centers itself before flinging headlong into the tumultuous schedule that we honor Mondays through Fridays. Sunday nights are the gift of pause, a deep breath, a comforting ritual in which we abide, often without noticing.  On Sundays we are given permission to eat dinner early, sometimes as early as 4:00 p.m. We have time to set the table, carefully folding napkins and laying down flatware, rather than throwing some pasta into a bowl and announcing that ""everyone is responsible for their own utensils and drinks."" There are no activities on Sunday night, no rushing to get to lessons, or board meetings or school events. Yet, it is still officially a school night so the boys are relegated to our home and presumably a reasonable bedtime. All of this mandatory togetherness is understood, and, without a word, embraced by all of us. We putter around, cross paths in the hallways, and move through the evening with an easiness that is elusive on all other nights when our schedules propel us in umpteen different, urgent directions. On Sunday nights, we return to ourselves and to each other.  Years ago when my grandmother was still living, Sunday nights were reserved for extended family dinners. We would assemble at someone's home -- my sister's, brother's or mine, taking turns hosting, sometimes cooking or ordering take out, but always together for the sake of Mom-Mom. We don't get together as regularly now that she is gone, but the essence of ""family"" still prevails for Sunday nights. Our open door policy -- one which happily welcomes anyone into our home on any night of the week -- is not outright negated, but it isn't honored either. Not on Sunday.  Of course, these evenings of Zen were not possible when the boys were little. There was much more house work to be done, baths to be given, stories to be read, and earlier bedtimes which cut Sunday nights short, trying to fit it all in before the requisite melt down, which by the way wasn't always my children's. The drum beat was relentless back then, even on Sundays. But the boys have grown and our family rhythm has changed. And suddenly, Sunday nights have become this lovely little interlude.  I realize I may be in the eye of the Sunday night hating storm. Years from now, Sunday nights may be the time the boys return to college so I reserve my right to return to loathing this time. But for now, it's an opportunity to be present, in the here and now, and choose not to fret about the days ahead. Instead, we connect and disperse to get done what needs to get done -- perhaps alone -- but under the same roof with the same unspoken understanding that we are exactly where we belong.Together."

The prosecution could accept a tempting plea deal and swiftly lock up Holmes forever, or move one step closer to a lengthy trial that could be therapeutic for a community nursing wounds from the horrific shooting. Holmes faces 166 counts of murder and attempted murder, among other charges, for the July 20 shooting at the opening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises.""“These cases can go on for years and years, it's very hard for families to go through the trial, and to go through the appeals,” Bremner said. “All of those considerations are something to look at.”Last week, the prosecution rejected a proposal that would have sent Holmes to prison for life without parole. Court documents cited the failure of the defense to supply prosecutors with psychiatric test results necessary to reach an agreement. The prosecution suggested the plea deal was ""extremely unlikely.”James Tierney, director of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia Law School, says that, in a state where it is legal, it is a prosecutor’s responsibility to pursue the death penalty if he believes the case calls for it, and spending the time and money without winning an execution would hardly signal complete failure.A prosecutor might say that such a case is “in the interest of justice,” Tierney, a former Maine attorney general, told HuffPost. “Let's say he doesn't get the death penalty. Does that also mean that a trial was a waste of time? I don't think so. It's important for the community to understand who committed that crime and what the circumstances were.“The victims, the community, and in this case people across the country and around the world will have the opportunity to see that the people who died were real people. [We will] get to see their faces, their families, their photographs.”Or perhaps not taking the plea deal is a play to force the hand of the defense, Bremner said. The prosecution has made it clear that it rejected the agreement in part because it did not have those psychiatric test results, which the legal team has described as integral to the case.“Usually prosecutors are pretty well informed before they go forward on a death penalty,” Bremner said. They could “force the defense to give them the test results, before taking the plea.”Should the case go to trial, the hurdles facing the prosecution’s potential pursuit of the death penalty would be significant. Even if Holmes is convicted and sentenced to die, history shows he could could sit on Colorado’s death row for years. The state has only executed one person since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, and currently has only three individuals awaiting execution.Additionally, to reach the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Holmes is not insane. Unlike most states, Colorado legislation places the burden of proof on the prosecution, rather than defense.Obstacles aside, the magnitude of the charges Holmes faces could make it the rare case in Colorado that ends in execution.“Trials have a way of bringing out more information,” Tierney says. “That's why we have trials.”"
