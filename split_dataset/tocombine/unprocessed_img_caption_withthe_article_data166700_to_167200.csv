0,WELLNESS,The Impossible: A Psychologist's Advice Viewing the Film About the Asian Tsunami,"Judy Kuriansky, Contributor
Dr. Judy Kuriansky",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-impossible-movie_us_5b9cb3dde4b03a1dcc8103c6,"When you're viewing a tragic story so close to reality, here's my advice for appreciating, yet also coping with, a movie about it.",2013-01-10,"This image released by Summit Entertainment shows Naomi Watts in a scene from ""The Impossible."" Watts was nominated Thursday, Dec. 13, 2012 for a Golden Globe for best actress in a drama for her role in the film. The 70th annual Golden Globe Awards will be held on Jan. 13. (AP Photo/Summit Entertainment, Jose Haro)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb3dd2400003200534d7f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was almost impossible for me to watch The Impossible. The movie, about a family vacationing in Thailand when the Asian tsunami struck, hit too close to home for this psychologist first responder who was in Sri Lanka to help after the real disaster and after many other such tragic events. Although a fictionalized account of a true story, this movie was painful to view, as I kept comparing it to reality.  In the film, two parents and their three children survive the tsunami and are reunited at the hospital where the injured mother had been taken. A little boy they saved from the rubble is also miraculously reunited with his father in the same hospital. A happy ending indeed, and one to rejoice over. I can certainly be thrilled for this real life outcome for the Spanish family on whom the film is based. Yet my mind could not help but drift to the hundreds of thousands who died there and to the families who were never reunited.Apparently, the film is appealing to audiences abroad, given a worldwide gross of more than $85 million, as reported by boxoffice.com. The L.A. Times cites big success in Brazil, France and Mexico. The results are less impressive to date in the U.S., where the gross is $3.6 million, but more is anticipated with the wider release.  Rarely do I talk to strangers after a film, but I felt so alone, desolate and distressed after seeing this movie that I had to turn to share my feelings and find out others' opinions -- both to calm my emotions and also to satisfy my reporter's curiosity. I turned to three men getting up from the seats behind me and asked what they thought.  ""Americans want a happy ending,"" said one.  ""But I'm American,"" I said, ""And I went to Sri Lanka right after the tsunami to help, and I was upset watching this because it didn't show what really happened to so many.""   Guessing from his accent that he came from south India, near Sri Lanka, I pressed, ""Doesn't it upset you, coming from near the devastated area?""  His two American friends agreed with me. ""Too many people died there,"" one said. ""It was annoying, considering what really happened.""  ""But it's just a movie,"" he added.   Of course he's right -- it is just a movie -- but I still must pursue my own reactions, compare them to others' and come up with ways to cope.  When you're viewing a tragic story so close to reality, here's my advice for appreciating, yet also coping with, a movie about it:  1) Identify what bothers you. The timing of this film's release made it even more painful for me, coinciding with the 9th anniversary of the real event in Asia in December 2004, on the heels of Super Storm Sandy in my hometown, and presaging the anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti coming up next week, and of the tsunami/earthquake in Japan looming in early March, and with my having seen first-hand the full spectrum of physical devastation, screaming pain, lost lives and families forever separated. If you've been through the real thing, one happy ending is surely inspiring but also difficult to digest.Dr. Judy with tsunami survivors at the water's edge in Sri Lanka  2) Suspend disbelief. The wounded mother in the film arrives at the hospital, is given a painkiller shot, and taken into surgery. Her perilously-injured leg heals. Later, as she is being wheeled on a gurney to a jet headed home, an insurance agent in a suit magically appears at her side with eager reassurance: ""Don't worry, everything is being taken care of.""   While it's comforting to see miraculous recoveries and reunions like those shown in the movie, my mind drifted to memories of hundreds of people lying screaming on lawns outside a Haitian hospital after the earthquake, and babies with amputated limbs lining hospital aisles, crying for medication no longer in supply. I also remembered huddling with survivors in Sri Lanka as they told me about children being swept from their arms and walking along the debris-strewn beach with a man who had lost 17 members of his family. With just a brief scene showing rows of shrouded bodies and some wounds that looked to me like movie make up, the film fortunately spares us from too many horrific images and pervasive death that really happened.  3) Enjoy learning what's real. Men are all too often depicted as macho in dealing with disaster, yet in this movie, male survivors huddled together to share their pain. One spoke of his mangled leg while despairing of ever finding his family, while the protagonist father expressed sadness over finding his wife's note that ""we are on the beach.""  Men -- as well as women -- get comfort after a disaster by sharing with others. I saw this after the tsunami when I led a group of men comforting each other and crying over the loss of loved ones. Although it contradicts others' advice that people post-disaster should ""contain"" their emotions, and caution that retelling their story can retraumatize them, I have seen first hand how sharing and support helps people heal.  4) Kindness prevails in disaster, but not always. In the film, one man refuses to give the main character father his cell phone to call home, saying, ""My battery is almost dead."" Fortunately, another man offers his, despite admitting that he, too, has little juice left. Much as we like to think all people are kind and helpful to one another in times of crisis, in reality this is true only to some extent.  5) Get over being annoyed at certain film techniques. During this film, I had to keep reminding myself not to be distracted by the characters remaining in their tattered clothing with their bloodied wounds showing even when boarding the jet for home, not to question where the fresh tangerine came from that the boy suddenly offers his suffering mom, and to dismiss thoughts of the special effects in the movie Alien when the mother and the woman in the hospital bed next to her both vomit up mud and twigs.   While scenes in the film of twisted trees and tangled remnants of life (e.g., muddy wedding photos, broken toys, and wrecked vehicles) are certainly consistent with what I have witnessed after disasters, I had to resist distress over dramatizations, like the mother's arm thrusting out of the depths towards a sparkling sky.  6) Finally, concentrate on the film's most powerful messages. In this movie, one minute the mother is peacefully reading in paradise; the next moment she is clinging onto a tree for life. One minute her young sons are snorkeling to view brightly-colored fish, frolicking with dad in the pool, and being called to see pristine aqua waters; the next moment, they are submerged and tossed by violent waters into darkness.  Take from the movie lessons you can apply to your own life: Paradise can quickly turn to hell. Circumstances can change in an instant. Life, and those you hold dear, are precious.For more on mental health, click here.For more by Judy Kuriansky, Ph.D., click here. "

But one of the best is pan-roasted chicken. Sure, a pan-roasted chicken recipe requires two steps -- which is one more than most chicken cooking methods -- but it means you get a great result, which we think makes it worth the effort. Frying the chicken lightly in the pan gives you a nice crisp skin, and finishing the cooking in the oven means you get a tender and juicy breast. This pan-roasted chicken recipe serves the chicken breast with mole sauce, a complex-flavored Mexican sauce.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

5,PARENTING,Wouldn't A 65-Question 'Nanny Survey' Scare Mary Poppins Away?,"Lisa Belkin, Contributor

To my surprise, though, the one that lingered was ""Lord, I didn't ask any of the right questions when I was hiring, did I?""",2013-01-10,Young mother and her little daughter drawing together,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb48a26000036007f95d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What to ask a job candidate who wants to take care of your children? Do you take the ""gut feeling"" approach -- have a chatty conversation and get a sense of whether they are someone you want in your life? The ""references are everything"" philosophy, believing that the best way to hire a babysitter or nanny is from within your circle of parent friends? The tryout plan -- have your finalists come work for an afternoon while you hang around nearby, eavesdropping? A couple in Sunnyside, Queens appears to have decided on the ""ask intrusive, and possibly illegal, questions which are more likely to reveal your own control issues than they are to learn something truthful about the interviewee"" style. Gawker reports that a recent Craigslist posting links to a 65-question survey of everything from the state of the nanny-hopeful's health (""#6. Will you be able to provide a letter from your primary care doctor stating that you are in good health and able to perform the ""rigorous job of caring for two small children? #7. Will you provide a letter from your doctor listing all your current prescription drugs?"") to how often she bathes (More than once per day? Once per day? Every other day? Once every third day? Once or twice per week? Less than weekly?)The listing has apparently been taken down, but the survey can still be found at this link. Reading it I had mixed feelings. ""These people need to chill"", I thought, followed quickly by ""they will never find anyone willing to work for them."" To my surprise, though, the one that lingered was ""Lord, I didn't ask any of the right questions when I was hiring, did I?""Most of the questions on this questionnaire, after all, are the questions that any parent really wants to know about anyone they leave their child with. (I exclude the psychobabble ones like ""Where do you fall in the birth order?"" the ones that hint at an agenda, like ""What age do you feel is the oldest a child should be breastfeeding?"", and the just plain hovering ones like ""Would you be comfortable maintaining short, neat fingernails while under our employment?"") But some of the rest. Heck yes, I would love answers to those. ""How often do you have a hangover?"" ""Do you take any of the following prescription drugs? Ritalin, Percoset, Adderal, Vicodin, Tylox, Oxycontin?"" ""Have you ever spent the night in jail?"" Because everyone I have ever allowed to look after my kids was, in the end, a gamble. That includes all their teachers, and the parents of their school friends, and, in a way, their father and grandparents. You can never know everything about anyone -- never predict when they will snap, or turn, what is really going on in their heads. In the end, all you have is a leap of faith. These 65 questions sure seem to shorten that jump. ""Which recereational drugs do you use? Inhalants, Ritalin, Percocet, Adderall, Vicodin, Cough meds, Mushrooms, Meth, LSD? Coke? Ecstasy? Heroin? Other?"" ""What was your high school GPA?"" ""Have you ever been expelled from middle school?"" The problem is, no one in their right mind (and we all want to hire someone who is) would give you an answer other than the one they assume you want to hear. And no one in their right mind wants to work for the person who sees them as a deviant to be unmasked. Which is why I predict this family will never find the ""magical Mary Poppins"" who loves to ""play, pretend, create, teach, and nurture,"" that they describe in the introduction to their survey. ""You are reliable, warm, and fun, but also know how to say ""no"" when necessary,"" they continue, addressing their ideal candidate. ""You"" also probably don't exist. But if you think you are that vision, know that this job is for two days a week, from 11:30 to 5:30, and it pays $15 an hour. Oh, and there is a confidentiality agreement to be signed. They can know everything about you. But you can't repeat anything about them.(By the way, I filled out the application, honestly. If I am given an interview I will let you know.)"

""I was not surprised after learning a little about CTE that he had it,"" Seau's son, Tyler, told the Associated Press. ""He did play so many years at that level. I was more just kind of angry I didn't do something more and have the awareness to help him more, and now it is too late."" Along with Seau, former Chicago Bears player Dave Duerson and Penn football player Owen Thomas have recently died of suicides connected with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The Associated Press reports that there are ""several dozen"" cases of football players with this type of brain injury; NFL player Jacob Bell even gave up his football career because he feared developing the condition, CBS News reported. A recent study also showed that NFL players may face a higher risk of the brain conditions of Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) than the rest of the population. The condition is also of increased risk to people in the military who've suffered traumatic brain injuries, HuffPost's David Wood previously reported. People with chronic traumatic encephalopathy have experienced repeated brain traumas and concussions, according to the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. Boxers had been known to be affected by this condition at higher degrees than other people for around a century now, but more research and reports are coming out today about other groups who are at risk. The condition occurs when the brain tissue begins to degenerate and a protein called tau starts to build up in the brain, the BU Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy reported. However, this tissue deterioration and protein buildup occur gradually and can occur long after a person has stopped receiving the repeated brain trauma (up to years or decades later). Just last month, a study published in the journal Brain showed that chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- which is marked by depression, aggression, anger, paranoia and can even lead to dementia -- could be the result of repeated head trauma, like that from football, Reuters reported. That study included 85 brains of people who formerly were athletes or soldiers. The study showed that CTE typically occurs in four stages, Reuters reported:Symptoms of stage one CTE include headache and loss of attention. Stage two sufferers may face depression, outbursts of anger and short-term memory loss. Those in stage three encounter executive dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Symptoms of the most severe fourth stage include dementia, aggression and difficulty finding words.Right now, CTE is only definitively diagnosed after a person has died, Brainline.org reported. Therefore, most of the focus in terms of stopping CTE has rested in prevention versus treatment -- including finding safer ways to play sports that may put athletes at risk of concussions."

The vaccine is made in different sized vials and pre-filled syringes.""At this point we are not able to make any more vaccine because we are gearing up for next year's vaccine,"" said Michael Szumera, a spokesman for Sanofi. Because flu strains mutate, vaccine makers must reformulate seasonal flu vaccine every year.Most conventional flu vaccines in the United States are still made using a 60-year-old process in which the vaccine is grown in fertilized chicken eggs, a method that can take several months to complete. But this is changing.In November, Novartis won U.S. regulatory approval to sell its cell-based flu vaccine, which uses a speedier manufacturing process. But it is not yet widely available.AstraZeneca Plc also sells flu vaccines in the United States. SHORTAGES FOR KIDSHenry Schein Inc, the nation's largest distributor of flu vaccines to physicians' offices, said it has vaccine available from Novartis for its customers immunizing patients four years old and older.However, it said ""we do not have the pediatric vaccine for children aged six months to four years old due to its unavailability from the manufacturer, Sanofi.""Roche Holding AG has a shortage of the liquid form of Tamiflu, given to children who already have the flu to slow or stop symptoms.Roche said it told wholesalers and distributors in recent weeks that temporary delays in shipments were imminent. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed that there have been supply interruptions in some locations.In the meantime, pharmacists can make a substitute by dissolving Tamiflu capsules in a sweet liquid, according to a spokeswoman for Roche's Genentech unit, which makes Tamiflu.Roche said an unexpectedly severe flu season has also hit Canada and that its government had agreed to lend Roche Tamiflu capsules from the country's emergency stockpile. It noted that the product is especially needed for hospitalized patients and those in nursing homes. SMALL FINANCIAL BOOSTKaren Andersen, an analyst with Morningstar, said Tamiflu sales would likely more than double to about $750 million this year from about $350 million in the 2011-2012 flu season. Tamiflu demand could boost overall Roche revenue this year by about 1 percent, but she said that would be a ""small positive impact"" for the company.Walgreen Co, which provides flu shots in some of its pharmacy locations, said on Wednesday it had given 5.7 million doses so far this flu season, up from 5.3 million a year ago. Walgreens is the largest distributor of flu vaccines in the United States other than the governmentJason Gurda, a healthcare equity research analyst at Leerink-Swann, said in a research report this week that 2,255 flu-related hospitalizations have been reported since Oct. 1, 2012, up 735 from the previous week but below the 6,896 hospitalizations in the 2009-2010 season.He said that could have a ""modestly positive impact"" on first-quarter volumes for hospitals and said that many companies, including HCA Holdings and Tenet Healthcare, had hospitals in the states most affected so far.One small insurer, Centene Corp, in December trimmed its earnings estimates for 2012 because its managed care business in Texas and Kentucky, where the flu struck early in the season, had boosted its medical costs. HOSPITALS OVERWHELMED Most of the United States is nearing peak infection levels seen during moderately severe flu seasons, according to the CDC. The agency estimates the percentage of people seeing health care providers for influenza had increased during the previous four consecutive weeks to 5.6 percent. That compares with 2.2 percent the previous year, when flu was mild.More than 15,000 cases have already been reported in New York State, nearly triple the number last year, though 2011-12 was an extremely mild flu year and not at all typical. Hospitalizations are up 169 percent.Manufacturers planned to produce 137 million doses of the vaccine and as of late last year, 112 million people had been vaccinated, the CDC said. Sanofi produced 60 million of those doses and GlaxoSmithKline PLC had planned to make 25 million doses.A spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline said on Thursday it expected to have the vaccine available until mid-February.
