And since Greek yogurt is good for more than just breakfast -- it enriches all kinds of recipes, and makes them healthy too -- we like knowing we've got a steady supply.Lucky for us, Chobani has made a handy conversion chart that shows us how to swap in yogurt for the less healthy options like oil, buttermilk and mayonnaise. This chart makes it simple to convert your older, pre-Greek yogurt recipes.

Sorting the winners from the losers is fun for pop culture-loving teens and parents. But families who dig into the new fall TV schedule together get more than just couch potato time.Watching TV can be a low-pressure way for a family to spend time together, especially when many teens are focused more on their own interests and less on you. Also, post-show chats about TV characters' choices can be a great (and not-so-forced) way to express your values when it comes to touchy issues.This season's line-up includes the role model-worthy heroine of a post-apocalyptic world, a Downton Abbey-like British drama and a comic-book hero. These seven shows have the potential to be entertaining and worthy choices for teens and parents to enjoy together.The New Normal, NBC, premieres Sept. 11Produced by Ryan Murphy of Glee fame, this comedy about a gay couple who hires a surrogate to carry their child has a great cast and loads of comedic material to work with. There's some sexual content and some edgy humor, which might make watching together occasionally uncomfortable. But for families looking for a modern spin on ""family,"" this one seems like a potentially hilarious way to spend an evening together.Tune in if you like: Raising Hope  Revolution, NBC, Sept. 17The latest from J.J. Abrams (Lost) looks like a potential winner. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, Revolution stars Tracy Spiridakos as Charlie Matheson, a strong-willed survivor of a world in which all technology has stopped working. She strikes out on her own to save her brother and possibly help her estranged uncle restore order to the chaotic world. Revolution is sure to be tense and violent, so parents will probably want to keep younger and more sensitive kids away, but thrill-seeking teens and adults can dig in.Tune in if you liked: JerichoCall the Midwife, PBS, premieres Sept. 30This British period drama will feed any Downton Abbey withdrawal your family is experiencing. Following a young midwife as she begins to work with an order of nuns in London's East End, this 1950s-set drama is sure to be filled with poignant moments and heartwarming messages that will appeal to teens and parents alike.Tune in if you like: Downton Abbey666 Park Avenue, ABC, premieres Sept. 30This creepy drama starring Terry O'Quinn (Lost) and Vanessa Williams (Ugly Betty) as devilish NYC landlords has the potential to offer scares without going too far into gore territory. While viewers will have to suspend their disbelief to get into the far-fetched story, families who like fantasy and don't mind a bit of blood can get their fright fix here.Tune in if you like: SupernaturalNashville, ABC, premieres Oct. 10For parents and teens who love a lathered-up guilty pleasure, Nashville looks like a sure thing. With a stellar cast including Hayden Panettiere (Heroes) and Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights) as dueling country singers, this soapy drama is full of intrigue, scandal and a few sexy moments. Parents can chat with teens about rivalry between women and why it's such a popular TV premise.Tune in if you like: SmashArrow, CW, premieres Oct. 10Comic book fans will be clamoring to watch the classic DC character revived as a modern-day playboy (Stephen Amell) turned do-gooder after years spent as a castaway. With shots of the shirtless hero doing sit ups and engaging in heavy-weapon duels, parents might want to preview this action thriller first before letting younger fantasy fans indulge.Tune in if you liked: AngelEmily Owens, M.D., The CW, premieres Oct. 16Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer makes her small-screen debut as recent med school graduate Emily Owens, a young woman who's ready to leave the social hierarchies of school behind and start down a mature path to adulthood. Sadly, she finds that the same insecurities and embarrassments (and even her high school nemesis) follow her to the hospital where she's training to be a surgeon. This light dramedy has its touching moments, thanks to Owen's knack for making personal connections with patients, and Gummer will hopefully smooth out a few annoying character tics as time goes on. Teens and parents both can relate to her character's struggles navigating social terrain and feeling insecure.Tune in if you like: Grey's AnatomyRead more from Common Sense Media:Great New TV for Kids Yes, You Can Make TV Time Count Using TV to Teach LessonsAbout Common Sense Media Common Sense Media is dedicated to improving the lives of kids and families by providing the trustworthy information, education, and independent voice they need to thrive in a world of media and technology.

(Which we respect, by the way.)She might not be as, umm, creative (or strange) about food as Aaron Paul (of ""Breaking Bad"") displayed in his Twitter feed, but we definitely liked what she had to say. Not only is she concerned about the current state of prunes (someone needs to be), but she also loves melted cheese. And we're big fans of anyone that loves melted cheese because we are obsessed. So while Rashida Jones isn't tweeting about plates of waffles with tons of whipped cream like Leslie Knope would, she stole our heart with her whimsical food tweets.

3,MONEY,Do the Rich Pay Their Fair Share of Taxes?,"John R. Talbott, Contributor

CEOs, entrepreneurs, bankers, lawyers, doctors and politicians at the top are all benefiting from the lower cost of labor for their employees and the lower cost of goods imported from low-wage countries. But our workers, our dear workers are getting crushed.",2012-09-11,Description Dom Perignon Champagne | Source originally posted to Flickr as http://flickr. 49503154413@N01/3994803605 Dom Perignon ... ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c438b2000003000fd8064.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An investing client of mine asked me Sunday morning if I thought it was fair that 50% of Americans paid little to no federal income tax.Of course, this is a loaded question. Others have pointed out that while some poorer Americans pay little to no federal income tax, they do pay 15.3% FICA taxes which covers their contributions to Social Security and Medicare, a highly regressive tax because only your first $106,000 of income is subject to the tax. In addition, local sales taxes are highly regressive because the poor and middle-class end up having to consume a much larger percentage of their income just to get by.But the question got me thinking. What do the poor and middle class do with their money? Have they figured out some great way to avoid taxes? If they don't have Swiss bank accounts or tax shelters in the Cayman Islands, how exactly are they avoiding paying federal income taxes? What I found out was terribly disturbing.I decided to examine household incomes in America by quintile to see, if indeed, the rich were paying too much tax. Following is a breakdown by quintile of the average incomes for American households for the year 2010. I have also included the data for someone with a million dollar income just to see what he or she ends up paying in tax; Source: Census Bureau - Table H-3Rather than making a traditional calculation on what percent of their total incomes each quintile pays in federal taxes (including FICA taxes), I thought it would be interesting to ask what percent in taxes they each pay after paying for basic necessities like food and shelter. I tried to come up with an estimate of what amount of money one would have to pay each month just to barely get by, to barely keep his or her head above water. Here is my estimate. You can see it is a very low estimate of what it costs to live in the US as it doesn't even include anything for medical expenses or health insurance or the required savings needed to send your kids to college or to retire on.I know this is low and I challenge anyone who disagrees to try living on $2,000 a month for a while and to feed and clothe a family. But, let's call it the bare necessities and see what it means for American families.If you subtract this $2,000 a month or $24,000 per year from the various quintiles' incomes, the following pre-tax disposable incomes result;And here are the actual average taxes paid by quintile; Source: Tax Policy CenterAnd so, here are the tax percentages that each quintile actually pays as a percent of their true disposable incomes assuming everyone needs at least $2,000 a month just to get by;This certainly doesn't look fair, much less progressive. A rate cannot even be calculated for the lowest quintile because they are $13,000 negative in the hole before even paying their taxes. Similarly, the second quintile owes more taxes each year than it has available after paying for basic necessities. The third quintile represents the median income earner in the United States and is paying approximately 50% more of their disposable income in taxes than our richest Americans.This is clearly a terribly regressive system in which the least among us are asked to pay the most from our disposable incomes. When looked at from this perspective there is no question that the wealthy have to pay a greater share of the taxes if we have a chance in balancing the federal budget.But these numbers are distressing even regardless of tax policy. They suggest that 40% of American families after tax don't even have enough income to cover life's bare necessities. Think of it. 40% of American families can't save a dime for a child's college education, can't afford to save a dollar for their retirement and can't afford to buy health insurance.What have we done? We have opened trade with countries that pay their workers less than one dollar an hour and get away with it because the cost of living in those countries is so low. But our own workers cannot be forced to compete with such low wages as it costs much more to live here.I have watched my native Kentucky lose its manufacturing plants overseas and have its union plants busted up solely by the threat to outsource jobs. Manufacturing wages in my parent's home town in Kentucky have declined from $15 an hour plus benefits to $7-$8 an hour with no benefits. You cannot raise a family on seven dollars an hour even if both parents work.We are killing this country. CEOs, entrepreneurs, bankers, lawyers, doctors and politicians at the top of the pyramid are all benefiting from the lower cost of labor for their employees and the lower cost of goods imported from low-wage countries. But our workers, our dear workers are getting crushed. This is not the America I grew up in. And this shall not stand.John R.
