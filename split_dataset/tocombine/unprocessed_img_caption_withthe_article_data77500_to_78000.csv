""I'd say Bernie Sanders is doing what [former Vermont Gov.] Howard Dean does: he's appealing to the hard left of the Democratic Party, and they're the activists, they're the rabid activists of the party,"" Santorum said.“He’s appealing to young people.

Sanders has expressed his support for medical marijuana, and for decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, but he hasn't come out in support of legalizing recreational marijuana, let alone other drugs.Earlier this year, Sanders said in a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session that he would look to Colorado to see how things progress there before taking a definitive position.""I will have more to say about this issue within the coming months,"" he wrote.(h/t Marijuana.com)"

There's more evidence that your morning mug won't harm your heart, according to a new study from Sweden.In the study, researchers found that drinking coffee was not associated with an increased risk of a condition called atrial fibrillation, which is a type of irregular heartbeat, in either men or women.""This is largest prospective study to date on the association between coffee consumption and risk of atrial fibrillation. We find no evidence that high consumption of coffee increases the risk of atrial fibrillation,"" Susanna Larsson, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and lead author on the study, said in a statement. ""This is important because it shows that people who like coffee can safely continue to consume it, at least in moderation, without the risk of developing this condition,"" Larsson said.The study comes on the heels of an earlier study from this year, which suggested that coffee may lower the risk of heart attacks.In the new study, the researchers looked at data from about 42,000 men and nearly 35,000 women who were participating in two long-running studies, the Cohort of Swedish Men and the Swedish Mammography Cohort. In 1997, all the participants filled out questionnaires that asked about their health and diet, including how many cups of coffee they drank daily or weekly. During the 12-year follow-up period, the researchers used the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register to determine which patients developed atrial fibrillation.The researchers found no association between coffee consumption and an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, though they did observe a slight increase in risk when they limited the analysis to men. However, this increase was not statistically significant (meaning it could have been due to chance), the researchers wrote.""Whether men may be more sensitive to a high coffee or caffeine intake warrants further study,"" the researchers wrote in their article, published today (Sept. 22) in the journal BioMed Central.The researchers also did a meta-analysis, looking at six other studies on atrial fibrillation and coffee intake, which confirmed their results.The researchers cautioned that although coffee does not appear to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation, it may increase risk for other types of irregular heartbeats.Follow Sara Miller on Twitter @SaraGMiller.

The second-ranking Democrat in the House told reporters he hopes the Senate sends his chamber a ""clean"" bill to fund the government for another few months no later than Monday or Tuesday.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) set up a procedural vote for a continuing resolution to fund the government through Dec. 11, which includes a measure to defund the family planning provider Planned Parenthood for one year.Democrats won't go along with it, and McConnell knows it. The Thursday vote is expected to fail in the Senate, after which McConnell will likely put forward a clean government funding measure.Hoyer said he'd prefer the bill continue funding only until mid- to late November to keep more pressure on lawmakers to negotiate and hammer out a long-term funding bill, but he said Democrats will take what they can get. ""We are deliberately trying to act responsibly within the framework of what is possible, and we are in the minority,"" Hoyer said when asked if Democrats were actively pushing to work things out with Republicans. Hoyer urged more conservative members to heed the advice of Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and other Republicans who have called for a clean funding measure immediately. Complicating matters in the House, representatives in the conservative wing of the party are vocally stating that this is a pivotal moment in their eyes: If House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) doesn't tether an amendment defunding Planned Parenthood to the spending bill, there is a very real chance they will try to oust him. Boehner has said he isn't worried about such comments and is focused on keeping the government running. Democrats are remaining quiet for now about what they would do if conservatives attempt to overthrow Boehner. Hoyer said he recognizes Boehner's plight, but that Democrats have not had formal discussions about what their response would be if the speaker were challenged.""Hopefully common sense and reasonableness will prevail,"" Hoyer said. ""Now, I know, there's not a lot to base that hope on. We hope that Republicans see the wisdom of passing a clean CR.""Also on HuffPost:"

And Marder acknowledged that they might feel a little embarrassed to be singled out. She told them:“What we want to thank you for today is your decision to cast your lot with the Jewish people by becoming part of this congregation, and the love and support you give to your Jewish partner.“Most of all, we want to offer our deepest thanks to those of you who are parents, and who are raising your sons and daughters as Jews,” she continued. “In our generation, which saw one-third of the world’s Jewish population destroyed … every Jewish boy and girl is a gift to the Jewish future.”The reaction to the blessing that followed — an outpouring of emotion and gratitude — surprised Marder. “I thought it would be a nice thing to do,” she said. “I was not prepared for the way people were weeping.”In reaching out to those whose contributions to the community had never been publicly appreciated before, it seemed that she had touched a nerve.News of what had happened at Congregation Beth Am in Los Altos Hills, Calif., in 2004 spread from synagogue to synagogue. Marder fielded phone calls from scores of rabbis who also wanted to affirm non-Jews in their congregations who had made a commitment to Judaism — learning the traditions, cooking Shabbat dinners and driving the carpool to Hebrew school.That same year, the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest American Jewish movement, of which Beth Am is a part, took note of Marder’s blessing and posted it on its website.Now, said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the URJ, it is uttered in hundreds of congregations across the nation on Yom Kippur, which begins this year at nightfall Tuesday (Sept. 22) and ends — after services and a fast — the following evening.The holiday, the “Day of Atonement,” is the most important in Judaism, marking the end of a period of introspection when Jews renew their commitment to their better selves.So it is fitting, Jacobs said, on this holy day, when the synagogue is most crowded, to call these non-Jews up to the bima — the platform at the front of the synagogue.“We want to say to you in the most traditional way,” he said, “God bless you.”It’s far more than a strategy for Jewish continuity, Jacobs continued, speaking of the drive to assure that the Jewish population — shrunk by persecution and more recently, by intermarriage and assimilation — will survive. The Pew Research Center pegs the Jewish intermarriage rate at 58 percent, a figure alarming to many who note that the children of such intermarriages often shed their Jewish identities.But the blessing Marder wrote offers a different perspective, said Jacobs. “It’s turning the fear of the non-Jew into the inspiration.”Rod McVeigh didn’t think of himself as an inspiration. But several years ago, sitting in his synagogue in Mahwah, N.J., on Yom Kippur, his own rabbi called him and the congregation’s other non-Jews up to the bima. It seemed awkward at first, to be distinguished in a place where he had always blended in.He and his wife — Rebecca Bernstein McVeigh, the principal of its religious school — have been members of Beth Haverim Shir Shalom for about 20 years. He is treasurer of the synagogue’s Brotherhood. And he proudly stood alongside his three sons for each of their bar mitzvahs.“Clearly it’s a little unnerving each time,” he said of the now annual blessing at the synagogue. “Do you want to stand up in front of everybody and walk up to the front?” But it soon becomes clear, he continued, that the blessing is not about singling people out, but embracing them.“It was awesome,” said McVeigh, who was born to a Catholic father and Methodist mother but did not have much of a religious upbringing. “It kind of gave you goose bumps. Not anything had happened like this before.”Though the blessing is now a Yom Kippur ritual at Beth Haverim Shir Shalom, Rabbi Marder has not yet repeated it with her California congregation, where about 30 percent of the couples are intermarried.Each year, she said, she brings a different group up to the bima for a blessing on Yom Kippur. Veterans one year. Teenagers another. And she added: “I don’t want to show a lack of respect for those who have made the ultimate commitment to Judaism, which is to convert. So for me it would feel a little strange to every year honor non-Jews.”Marder plans to reintroduce the blessing in the future, she said, perhaps when there are more members of her 1,650-household congregation who weren’t present when it was first bestowed in 2004.How does she account for the reaction that day, all the crying and hugging?“I think there had been a lot of buried hurt in people’s lives,” she said, for non-Jews and their families who hadn’t felt accepted in some way.In the Reform and the smaller Reconstructionist Jewish movements — which has also in recent years incorporated blessings for non-Jews on important days on the Jewish calendar — clergy may marry Jews to non-Jews. And the children of non-Jewish mothers and Jewish fathers can be considered Jewish. Neither is acceptable in more traditional streams of Judaism, absent a conversion.Though not at her congregation, some non-Jews may have been made to feel unworthy, rejected, Marder said. The blessing, perhaps, made some amends.“This was a gesture of love and affirmation, and I think it touched people’s hearts.”Also on HuffPost:"

The meeting will be the latest in a series of accomplishments for the group of activists seeking racial justice and policing reforms.Mckesson tweeted at the 2016 presidential hopeful on Monday asking if she could meet before the release of her criminal justice platform:Clinton responded to Mckesson's request Tuesday evening:""It demonstrates a willingness to engage on a host of topics related to criminal justice and racial equity,"" said Mckesson, who has been openly critical of various presidential candidates for seldom addressing the unique issues facing black Americans. ""I'm hopeful that we will have a candid and thoughtful conversation that will lead to the release of a strong platform by her campaign.""The meeting between Clinton and Mckesson has not been scheduled yet, a spokesperson from the Clinton campaign told HuffPost.Campaign Zero is a comprehensive set of policy demands on the federal and state level released in August by a group of prominent Black Lives Matter activists. Mckesson sits on the planning team alongside other well-known activists Johnetta Elzie, Samuel Sinyangwe and Brittany Packnett.Activists within the Black Lives Matter movement are raising systemic racism as a campaign issue for the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Campaign Zero representatives recently met with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic nomination, to discuss police violence and militarization, community empowerment, ending the drug war and closing the wealth gap. Last month, Sanders introduced a policy platform targeting structural anti-black racism. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) has rolled out a framework for criminal justice reform, although it's less explicit in its discussion of racism than Sanders' platform.Clinton, however, has not yet produced a comprehensive agenda focusing on police violence or mass incarceration -- issues that disproportionately affect black Americans -- even though she is currently the most popular candidate among black voters, with a favorability rate of 68 percent. Clinton has also been criticized for her role in facilitating mass incarceration -- something critics say Clinton has done in part by supporting tough-on-crime initiatives.Mckesson and Packnett spoke with Clinton’s policy director and others in the camp about police reform, criminal justice and other issues of importance to the black community in July.Also on HuffPost:"

Though there were no serious injuries, a 13-year-old girl suffered a minor cut when a bullet struck the windshield of the vehicle she was in. Last Friday night, authorities made a break in the case when they arrested Merritt. But the suspect says that police have got the wrong guy, and even authorities admit that they can only tie Merritt to four of the 11 total shootings.That didn't stop Republican Gov. Doug Ducey from exclaiming on Twitter that ""We got him!"" shortly after police arrested Merritt outside of a Wal-Mart.""All I have to say is I'm the wrong guy,"" Meritt said at a court appearance on Saturday, where his bail was set at $1 million."" I tried telling the detectives that.""The Associated Press reports that according to court documents, police traced bullet fragments to a weapon that Merritt had pawned.""My gun's been in the pawn shop the last two months,"" Meritt said during Saturday's court appearance.

She begins on Oct. 5 and is based in New York City.“[Walsh] brings a deep knowledge of American political history and a passion for writing about elections, social movements, race, gender, class, media and many other subjects,” Nation Executive Editor Richard Kim said in a note to staff obtained by The Huffington Post.Walsh hinted at her long tenure at the pioneering liberal website in a statement.“I’ve loved my time at Salon, but now, as we face the Donald Trump farce and mull the meaning of Bernie Sanders’s surge, I’m thrilled to have the ballast of a magazine that’s spent 150 years chronicling American history, to help me take the long view,” Walsh said."
22,POLITICS,"GOP Candidates Say Immigrants Don’t Learn English, But Report Proves Them Wrong",Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-immigration-learning-english_us_560315ace4b0fde8b0d124ea,"They also say immigrants cause more crime, which is false.",2015-09-23,A report published on Monday refutes Republican presidential candidates' claims that immigrants to the U.S. aren't learning English.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560316bd1c00002500082ef3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Republican presidential candidates frequently employ harsh rhetoric to discuss immigration, accusing immigrants of failing to assimilate and integrate into American society. But an extensive report released this week debunks their claims, finding that immigrants make great efforts to learn English and adopt American values and customs, and that subsequent generations are entirely integrated.The report, published on Monday by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and compiled by a panel of prominent immigration scholars, defines integration as the process by which immigrants ""become American,"" adopting similar values and customs of native-born Americans and achieving similar socioeconomic outcomes. The research concludes that “across all measurable outcomes, integration increases over time, with immigrants becoming more like the native-born with more time in the country, and with the second and third generations becoming more like other native-born Americans than their parents were.”Among its specific findings: immigrants and their children do learn English -- and, contrary to GOP candidates' scaremongering, immigrants are actually less likely to commit crimes than the average American.Learning EnglishPoliticians frequently chide immigrants for not learning English. During CNN’s Republican presidential debate last week, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) -- actually one of the GOP’s more moderate voices on immigration -- said he opposes other Republicans’ proposals to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., but said they should learn English to remain in the country.“They can come here, but they should learn to speak our language,” he said. He then quipped: “I don’t speak it very well, but look how far I’ve come.”The importance of learning English is a common refrain in conversations about undocumented immigrants. Even candidates who support immigration reform, like Graham, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), say that a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants should include a requirement that they learn English.While the new report acknowledges that immigrants often speak their native language at home, it also found that a majority of them are in fact learning English, or already know it. Sixty-six percent of immigrants who speak a foreign language at home also can speak English ""very well"" or ""well,” according to the research.“Today’s immigrants are actually learning English faster than their predecessors,” the report says, in part because many immigrants come from countries where English is already widely used or taught in schools.Thirty-eight percent of new legal immigrants took a class in English before coming to the United States, according to research cited in the report. And almost all immigrants have “consumed at least one form of English language media prior to departure,” which also helps improve their knowledge of the language.In general, the children of immigrants are learning English at faster rates today than in previous generations, the report says. Typically, the grandchildren of immigrants to the U.S. and their descendants only know how to speak English.CrimeAnother Republican allegation against immigrants is that they create more crime. Famously, reality television star and real estate mogul Donald Trump kicked off his presidential campaign this year by calling undocumented immigrants from Mexico ""rapists"" and accusing them of “bringing crime.” On the campaign trail, he has repeatedly brought up the murder of Kathryn Steinle, a San Francisco woman killed by an undocumented immigrant, as evidence of rising crime committed by immigrants. But this “immigrant crime wave” is a myth, according to this week’s report. Researchers found that crime rates in immigrant communities are much lower than national averages. Immigrants are “much less likely” to commit crimes, and communities with high immigrant populations have lower crime rates than “comparable non-immigrant neighborhoods.” Additionally, immigrants have lower rates of incarceration than the average population, even after including immigrants who are in jail for violating immigration laws.While the report’s authors cautioned that their job is to produce scientific research, not political prescriptions, they found substantial evidence that the integration process can be affected by an immigrant's legal status. Undocumented immigrants and their children have a harder time because their undocumented status limits their ability to apply to college, seek higher-paying jobs and receive government benefits.The report, which is the National Academies’ first review of the process of immigrant assimilation and integration since 1997, does have its caveats. The editors acknowledge that they need to delve deeper into the subject to strengthen some of their findings -- a compilation of prior research by a large, interdisciplinary panel of experts in economics, political science, sociology and anthropology, among other fields. One of the big limitations, they wrote, is a “dearth of available longitudinal data to measure immigrant integration.”In general, immigrant assimilation and integration is a complicated process that can be hard to define and measure. The way immigrants navigate and adapt to the United States depends on a lot of factors, like their socioeconomic status and where in the country they settle. As the report’s authors explained, it also relies on a feedback system involving both immigrants and native populations.“Integration is a two-way process: it happens both because immigrants experience change once they arrive and because native-born Americans change in response to immigration,” they wrote.What the report does prove quite effectively is that, when making immigrants the target of attacks, the GOP candidates are mostly spouting falsehoods.Sadly, their claims are nothing new. Immigration to America has occurred in several different waves, with people arriving from different areas of the world. During each wave, anti-immigrant lawmakers accused the new arrivals of causing more crime and presenting a threat to native populations. They also lamented that immigrants were not learning English, and consequently, there have been perennial efforts to make English the official U.S. language.Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the child of Indian immigrants and perhaps the biggest voice on immigrant assimilation in the GOP field, continually rails against “hyphenated Americans” and claims that “immigration without assimilation is invasion” -- a favorite catchphrase of his.“We need to insist people that want to come to our country should come legally, should learn English and adopt our values, roll up their sleeves, and get to work,” he said last month.But the report’s findings demonstrate that Jindal and his fellow GOP hopefuls are operating on an increasingly antiquated and inaccurate theory of immigrant assimilation. Most immigrants are doing exactly what the GOP field says they are not doing -- and to some extent, doing much more. Also on HuffPost:"
