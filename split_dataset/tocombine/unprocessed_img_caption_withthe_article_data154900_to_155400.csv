6,PARENTING,Google Glass: A Wink Away from Stranger Danger?,"Sue Scheff, Contributor

Stranger danger and predators are always a major fear, whether online or off.",2013-05-13,"A visitor of the 'NEXT Berlin' conference tries out the Google Glass on April 24, 2013 in Berlin. 'NEXT Berlin' describes itself as 'a meeting place for the European digital industry'. Organisers say that at the conference, 'marketing decision-makers and business developers meet technical experts and creative minds to discuss what will be important in the next 12 months'. The conference is running from April 23 to 24, 2013. AFP PHOTO / OLE SPATA / GERMANY OUT (Photo credit should read Ole Spata/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d27de1f00002d00217fdd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We are getting used to the constant evolution of technology. As a matter of fact, in many ways, it has become the norm within our culture today. Some things will not change no matter what generation we are in, and that is the concern for the safety of our children. Stranger danger and predators are always a major fear, whether online or off.The recent media coverage of Google Glass has turned many heads, including those of the ""Today Show"" hosts who showcased the glasses on their morning show with Lance Ulanoff, Mashable's editor-in-chief.Google Glass allows the user to take pictures in a snap -- or let me rephrase, in a wink or voice-activated command! It also can allow you to take videos and then immediately upload them to your Google+ account.A bit of a shocking revelation was found in a recent article in an educational online site claiming to have a pulse on how teachers would use Google Glass. Looking at it academically, albeit somewhat unrealistically, the authors are envisioning the potential for learning experiences with Google Glass.One positive use of Google Glass for teachers, they claim, is the ability to create first-person educational video guides. No harm there, and this could be a benefit at every grade level.However, the article goes on to say how students can take advantage of Glass: ""Students can throw on a pair of the glasses and record interactions with fellow students on field trips and while out of the classroom in general. A great way for students to start thinking strategically about their everyday actions and what they can learn from them.""Students? At what age? Are they the same students we are preaching to about bullying and cyber bullying prevention? What happens when a cyber bully decides to manipulate these videos? How do we know what they are doing with these videos once they leave school property? Who really owns these videos, and who has legal rights to them when they end up on a website that is not exactly one you would want your child to be seen on? Google Glass may have its place in the technology world for the geeks that love their electronic toys and with educators using them for teaching purposes, but what happens when this device gets into the hands (or rather, onto the eyes) of unsavory people?A recent LA Times article warns: ""If you see someone wearing Google Glass wink at you, you might want to get out of the way because they're probably not flirting with you.""Parents also need to consider this issue brought up in a recent ZDNet article:Parents are already on the lookout for strangers apparently taking photos of children in parks and similar places. There are plenty of incidents reported of parents getting police officers involved because they think someone they don't know is taking photos of kids. Imagine how much worse that will get with several Google Glass wearers in the park. Just seeing someone looking at kids will set off the parent alarm.Imagine your child playing innocently at a playground. Whether they are swinging, sliding down the slide, or hanging upside-down on the monkey bars, kids are known to have a lot of fun at the park or playground, including little girls in dresses. Exactly what images will predators be snapping with their Google Glass and immediately uploading to their Google+ accounts? Where will those photos or videos go next?On May 3rd, a petition was formed: Ban Google Glass from use in the USA until clear limitations are placed to prevent indecent public surveillance.It seems that people are starting to think ahead in terms of this piece of Glass potentially causing problems.The Internet doesn't sleep. Which is why parents need to wake up to the latest and greatest tech gadgets, such as Google Glass. They may have some thrilling features, but are they worth the risk?Ladies, are you taking a stroll down the beach in your newest bikini? Have you considered a stalker taking a picture or video of you and it hitting the web? And potentially not on a flattering website? Porn sites are a very prosperous venue for many predators.This doesn't mean that young girls and teenagers in their bikinis aren't immune from these predators.As an adult that has been a victim of stalkers online, I feel we, as parents, need to be proactive when it comes to learning about technology that will put us all -- and especially our children -- at risk and in potential danger.What can you do to protect your kids and yourself?Start by educating yourself about Google Glass. Like with the Google Apps for Education, there are always going to be differences of opinions. I believe an educated parent will have safer children.Privacy is the main concern with Google Glass and this is an extremely serious issue, especially since it opens the door to other forms of creepy predators -- not only for us, but for kids. Privacy is a word that is already crawling toward extinction, but do we have to push it there faster?Takeaway tips:• Privacy is slowly disappearing. Cherish it, take steps to learn all you can about Google Glass. • Stranger danger can come in all forms. Online and off, talk to your kids about always being aware of their surroundings, whether they are in a park, a shopping mall or online with social networking or other places in cyberspace. • Be a proactive parent. Be CyberWise, No Grownup Left Behind™, please.Google Glass will be priced at about $1,500.00. That price point may seem high, especially for most teachers, however it is not out of reach for some people whom may not have the best of intentions."

That leads to the seat-kicking. Then the screams: ""Mommy, he's looking out my window! Make him stop.""Begun the backseat wars have.Of course we'd never resort to threatening our kids in the car to make them behave (see video below). Nuh-uh.But redirection will only get you so far. Then things devolve so quickly into backseat anarchy that the hapless driver is rendered powerless in mediating disputes. What should you do?We've tried a few things as part of our family adventure blog. Some work, some ... not so much. One thing we've been able to do is find the restart to harmony button.And it isn't the threat of having to walk home. (Besides, our kids know that if you're more than a mile away from home it's really only lip service.)I know you really want the reset button secret first, but indulge me. There are common things that lead up to the meltdowns and elbow fights we should talk about first. Here's our assessment:Why should I care? If you want you kids to behave you should show them that you're paying attention. We developed a points game that tracks our kids' behavior and credits them for good behavior. The points give them the right to choose: will I be good -- or bad?Who's in charge? Our kids are control freaks. Everybody wants to be in charge. Even if it's only over the songs we'll play on the stereo, what game to play in the car, what to do at our pitstops or where we stop for lunch. We use the point system mentioned above to reward their good behavior and give them a sense of control during the journey. Other moms do a rotation so each child gets a chance to choose. Both work.I'm bored! This is soooooo hard to handle. Just accept the fact that no matter what you plan and bring to keep the kids engaged, there will come a time when you'll hear the dreaded, ""Are we there yet?"" It is important that you not offer any options as questions, for example, ""Would you like to ...?"" Trust me, the answer will be, ""Nothin'."" This is probably a combination of our next two bullet points. Instead of asking, tell them something about when they were little or when you were little. They'll either fall asleep or beg for more. Win-win!Nobody is paying attention to me! Well, duh! The driver is probably driving and the person riding shotgun is either gripping the door in fear or checking email. Just kidding. It's easy to forget about the kids when they're out of sight, quietly playing Minecraft. But it helps to occasionally give them a fist bump for being so good. The point system and the rotation of choice privileges work great when the kids are bored.I'm uncomfortable. You made it to the reset button! See that wasn't so bad. Here's our never-fail, 100 percent, tried and true way to reset your kids behavior. Can you guess what it is?Most often problems in the backseat (even those listed above) happen when the kids are uncomfortable. Sitting to long, not eating at regular intervals or eating the wrong foods, not having enough water is enough to turn your little angels into cranky, irrational, territorial elbow-swinging monsters. I've become very familiar with this animal over the last two years of road tripping.Here's what we do: Without threatening to make them walk home, we calmly pull over our rental car at the next available safe place. We get out of the car and move around, toss a ball or jump rope as a contest for choice privileges and drink some water. If the timing is right we'll have a meal or healthy snack.It works almost every time. Even if you're running late it's better to stop and reset so everybody is in a good mood when you arrive at your destination.What do you do to reset sibling wars and the battle of the backseat?"
