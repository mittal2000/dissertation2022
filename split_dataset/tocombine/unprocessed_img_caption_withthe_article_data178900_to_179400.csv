A man died and a woman became seriously ill after contracting a rare rodent-borne disease that might have been linked to their stay at this popular lodging area in Yosemite National Park, officials said Thursday. The man was the first person to die from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome contracted in the park, though two others were stricken in a more remote area in 2000 and 2010, officials said. Testing by the Centers for Disease Control and the California Department of Public Health showed the virus was present in fecal matter from deer mice trapped in Curry Village, an historic, family friendly area of cabins.

""People who stayed in the tents between June 10 and Aug. 24 may be at risk of developing HPS in the next six weeks.""Yosemite officials earlier this week shut down all 91 of the insulated tent cabins after finding deer mice, which carry the disease and can burrow through holes the size of pencil erasers, nesting between the double walls.Park authorities said on Friday that they had contacted approximately 3,000 parties of visitors who stayed in the tent cabins since mid-June, advising them to seek immediate medical attention if they have symptoms of hantavirus.Nearly 4 million people visit Yosemite, one of the nation's most popular national parks, each year, attracted to the its dramatic scenery and hiking trails. Roughly 70 percent of those visitors congregate in Yosemite Valley, where Curry Village is located. YOSEMITE LOGS 1,500 CALLSThe virus starts out causing flu-like symptoms, including headache, fever, muscle ache, shortness of breath and cough, and can lead to severe breathing difficulties and death.The incubation period for the virus is typically two to four weeks after exposure, the CDC said, with a range between a few days and six weeks. Just over a third of cases are fatal.""Providers are reminded to consider the diagnosis of HPS in all persons presenting with clinically compatible illness and to ask about potential rodent exposure or if they had recently visited Yosemite National Park,"" the CDC said.Although there is no cure for hantavirus, which has never been known to be transmitted between humans, treatment after early detection through blood tests can save lives.""Early medical attention and diagnosis of hantavirus are critical,"" Yosemite superintendent Don Neubacher said in a statement. ""We urge anyone who may have been exposed to the infection to see their doctor at the first sign of symptoms and to advise them of the potential of hantavirus.""Yosemite spokeswoman Kari Cobb said rangers have answered some 1,500 phone calls from park visitors and others concerned about the disease. But she said the outbreak had not triggered a wave of cancellations""Right now it's normal numbers for Friday,"" she said. ""There have been cancellations, but it would be grossly overstated to say they're cancelling en masse. There's quite a bit of people out there still. It's still summer and a holiday weekend. It's still the summer crowds.""A national park service officials has said that public health officials warned the park twice before about hantavirus after it struck visitors. But it was not until this week that the hiding place for the deer mice carrying the virus was found.Hantavirus is carried in rodent feces, urine and saliva, which dries out and mixes with dust that can be inhaled by humans, especially in small, confined spaces with poor ventilation.People can also be infected by eating contaminated food, touching contaminated surfaces or being bitten by infected rodents.

When Sedona's much-beloved Enchantment Resort was planning its recent $25 million renovation, it added floor-to-ceiling windows and wraparound patios so guests would have unfettered views of the area's magnificent red-rock-dominated landscape.Che-Ah-Chi -- the two-floor Southwestern-inspired restaurant that joined Enchantment in May -- opens out to a panoramic showing of these red-rock formations. ""We wanted to make sure that the guests felt like they were right in the canyon,"" explains resort president Mark Grenoble, who oversaw the renovations, including the addition of Nana doors at Che-Ah-Chi to create a special indoor-outdoor dimension.The task of developing a stimulating space that marries available visuals with what comes out of the kitchen requires chefs who not only appreciate the scenery but are also inspired by it. ""There's no doubt you're in Arizona red-rock country when dining here,"" says Che-Ah-Chi executive chef David Schmidt. ""My menu includes a lot of local ingredients, like the mushrooms I forage in the nearby forest, so there's definitely a Southwestern accent to my cooking. I really want diners to taste what fresh Arizona cuisine can be, and the jaw-dropping view just reinforces that every time they look up from their plates.""Across the Atlantic in Porto, Portugal (the country's second-largest city), the restaurant at The Yeatman Hotel is celebrating its first Michelin star for its Portuguese seafood menu courtesy of Ricardo Costa, one of that country's most notable chefs. The coup for Costa shows The Yeatman's commitment to having one of the best dining rooms around, and this attention to superior quality extends beyond the kitchen.Situated along the Douro River, The Yeatman was destined from the beginning to have gorgeous views of the city's historic center. Its fifth-floor restaurant has some of the most commanding vantage points at the hotel, especially if you are lucky enough to snag a spot on the terrace, where you can watch the flow of the river -- the life source of the region's famed vineyards. You can sample these very grapes at The Yeatman, whose cellar houses the largest collection of Portuguese wines in the world.In Tokyo, the year-old Sushi Sora restaurant, on the 38th floor of the Mandarin Oriental, delivers stunning cityscape views that include the world's tallest tower. Sushi chef Yuji Imaizumi serves up a rotating menu that reflects the changing seasons. ""Eating seasonal ingredients while seeing the season in front of you is a special experience,"" he says.

So guilty, in fact, that you want to buy your kids presents to try to make it up to them.",2012-08-31,A cute tired boy and his mother on the porch at home showing love,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c346e250000320035fa81.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Admit it. You feel guilty about your divorce. So guilty, in fact, that you want to buy your kids presents to try to make it up to them. Something like a new puppy, because a little furry bundle of love will make them feel better. Or a new X-Box 360, because all that game playing will surely cheer them up. Or a bunch of new clothes so they will get the message that their life is so much better when they're with you.While owning up to these feelings isn't wrong, acting on them would be. Sending your kids the message that you think their feelings are up for sale is as insulting as it is damaging. But I have some good news for you. There are five gifts you can give your kids after your split that are actually good for them -- and it won't cost you a dime.1.  Make your house a home. Your kids need as much security and stability as possible in the wake of your divorce. And the physical manifestation of that is the space they live in. If your ex moved out and took the sofa with him, buy or borrow another one to replace it. If that's not possible, at least pull a couple of chairs around to fill the empty space. But don't completely rearrange everything because that can be unsettling, too. The goal is to eliminate the stress experienced by your kids every time they see the gaping hole where the sofa used to be.If you're the one who is moving, make sure your new place accommodates your kids. I'm not saying that each kid needs his own bedroom; but they at least need a bedroom. In other words, don't move to a one bedroom apartment and expect your kids to crash on the living room floor. Also, don't live out of boxes -- make sure to unpack and decorate. Put familiar things up on the walls. Have your kids' artwork and family photos on display. Not only should your new space feel homey -- it should feel like their home. 2. Root for your ex to be a good parent. Just as a terrible singer can nonetheless be a good dancer, the fact that your ex was a bad spouse doesn't mean he or she is also a bad parent. And there's nothing like a divorce to make even the least attentive parent suddenly begin campaigning for Parent of the Year. If you've been doing the lion's share of the parenting all along, that can be hard to take. Maybe you're correct in your suspicion that your ex's newfound interest in parenting is only for appearances, or to gain an advantage in the divorce, or to curry favor with the kids (or all of the above), and not because he or she's had a change of heart and doesn't want to miss out on any more precious childhood moments. But at the end of the day, this is one of those situations where the motivation doesn't really matter. If your kids emerge from the divorce with a better parent, who cares what prompted the change? A more involved and attentive mom or dad is a good consolation prize for having to go through the upheaval of divorce. So, don't cheat your kid out of this chance by undermining or sabotaging your ex's efforts to be a good parent.   3. Don't use your kids as your BFFs. It goes without saying that you shouldn't talk trash about your ex to your kids. But even if you're not talking trash, you shouldn't use your kids as your confidants. It's okay for your kids to pick up on the fact that you are sometimes sad or upset as a result of the divorce. After all, you are human. And seeing you work through the inevitable ups and downs in a healthy way models for them how adults handle difficult times. But turning to your kids when you need a shoulder to cry on reverses the roles of parent and child and can interfere with your kids' relationship with both parents. Using your kids as your emotional support can make them reluctant to ship off to spend time with your ex because they are worried about leaving you alone. So turn to your friends when you need some shoring up. And let your kids turn to you when they need the same. 4. Don't date until your divorce is final. Your job as a parent is to shepherd your kids through your divorce while protecting them from unnecessary drama. There is zero percent chance that firing up your love life before your divorce is final will make your divorce go more smoothly and make your home life more stable. Be a responsible parent and wait to date until your divorce is over and everyone is on solid emotional ground. Use this time to bond with your kids while everyone adjusts to the new configuration of your family. In the event that delayed gratification and impulse control just aren't your thing, at least keep your kids out of your love life. Rather than having your new love interest over to play house while your kids are home, take advantage of the built-in breaks provided by the custody arrangement and schedule your dates while your kids are with your ex.5. Don't divorce your kids. Whether the split up was your idea or not, divorce provides an incredible opportunity for you to reassess where you are in life and make adjustments. It gives you the chance to close the book on bad habits as well as begin new story lines. But whatever new adventures are beckoning, it's not okay to write your kids out of your life. Your goal as a parent is to be left with a mountain of good memories when your kids are grown, not a river of regret. So go ahead and register for a French class, but don't up and move to France -- at least not yet. Your kids will be gone before you know it and then you'll be free to explore distant horizons. When it comes to the intersection of parenting and gift-giving, conventional wisdom says it's best to exercise restraint lest you spoil your kids. But these five gifts are the exception to the rule. You don't have to pick just one -- you can go crazy and give all five. Because the more of these you lavish on your kids, the better off they'll be. And you'll even get a gift in return: the peace of mind of knowing that you did the right thing."
7,PARENTING,Note To Candidates: 'Woman' Does Not Equal 'Mom',"Lisa Belkin, Contributor
Senior Columnist, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mom-voters_us_5b9c363de4b03a1dcc7d21e0,"By reducing all parents to mothers, and all women to mothers, candidates diminish and dismiss us, even as they are heaping us with praise.",2012-08-31,"Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney addresses delegates before speaking at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday, Aug. 30, 2012. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c363d2400003100531d5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his speech to the Republican convention last night, Mitt Romney used some version of the word ""mom"" 14 times. That was one more time than he said the word ""Obama"" or ""future"" and ten more times than the word ""economy."" Even more striking than how often we came up was the reverence he had for us. ""I knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine,"" he said of his wife, Ann. ""And I knew without question, that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine."" The speech dripped with such reverence for women who have children that one of the most popular tweets last night was this one from @dweinberger.Coming as it did the night after Paul Ryan's own ode to motherhood (""to this day, my mom is my role model"") which, in turn, came the day after Ann Romney's (""It's the moms who always have to work a little harder, to make everything right), mothers can feel pretty smug in their own importance this quadrennial cycle. Hold on, you say, haven't mothers always been a group wooed by politicians? Why else have they spent all those decades kissing babies? Yes. But this year feels different. A word count alone hints at what's changed. John McCain used the word ""mother"" twice in his acceptance speech four years ago and didn't use ""mom"" once. George W. Bush thanked his own mother, briefly, in 2004, then only used the word once or twice again. Sarah Palin's official acceptance speech included only three ""moms,"" though she famously added a fourth with her off-the-prompter comment about hockey moms and lipstick. Obama, at his last convention, didn't say ""mom"" at all. But this is a good thing, right? A reflection of politicians' long overdue realization that mothers deserve consideration and attention? It would be good if it were true. As has long been the case, both parties this year know that they cannot win without women. And their embrace of mom-without-the-apple-pie is just the latest example of campaigns reducing us to shorthand rather than addressing all of our dimensions. The elder George Bush did it in 1988, choosing the handsome Dan Quayle to appeal to the ladies (after Walter Mondale arguably chose Geraldine Ferraro for a version of the same reason four years earlier). John McCain did it with Palin last time around, assuming we would vote for one of our own. But those choices, patronizing to women as they might have been, were decidedly less direct than the ones we saw in Tampa this past week. In earlier years, candidates assured us that they liked women, or were attractive to women, or were women. Now they are turning the lens and telling women that we ourselves are wonderful -- mostly because we are moms. In part what rankles is their overuse of the shorthand, nickname version -- mom, not mother. When I hear it, I sense tones of ""honey"" or ""dear."" Add to that the fact that the March of the Moms through political rhetoric nowadays eliminates men -- including many of the men giving these speeches -- from the equation. Parents = mothers. It is interesting that candidates have chosen this tack now, because it is several years behind the Zeitgeist, at a time when men are steadily becoming more invested in their identities as dad. But mostly what makes me want to snap back at my TV during these odes to motherhood is the corollary calculation that women = mothers. By reducing the votes of all women to those of a subset, by assuming the concerns we share (or don't) are exclusively about children, candidates diminish and dismiss us. They assume that just by praising us as parents we won't notice that they haven't mentioned what they plan to DO for us, as parents, or as women.We have noticed. And we vote."

The surgery has prompted the 57-year-old to cancel a concert tour in Japan, the Associated Press reported. But the good news is he shouldn't need any more surgeries. People magazine reported that Van Halen will recover over the next four to six months. Diverticulitis occurs when the digestive system's diverticula (the name for pouches in the intestinal lining) become infected or inflamed, according to the Mayo Clinic. The A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia reported that the infection or inflammation is caused by fecal pieces getting trapped in the diverticula. The condition occurs in about 10 to 25 percent of people who have diverticulosis, which is the condition when the diverticula come out through the weak spots in the intestinal lining, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) reported. Diverticulosis is relatively common, occurring in about one in 10 U.S. adults over the age of 40, and about half of adults over the age of 60.When a person has both diverticulosis and diverticulitis, it's together called diverticular disease, the NIDDK said. Symptoms of diverticulitis include having a tender feeling in the bottom left part of the abdomen, as well as having bloating, gas, fever, nausea and loss of appetite, according to the A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia. Constipation, diarrhea, bloating and sometimes even rectal bleeding may also occur, the Mayo Clinic reported. Even though the exact cause of diverticular disease is unknown, experts think that it may have something to do with not getting enough fiber in the diet (possibly from overconsumption of low-fiber processed foods), according to the NIDDK. When you don't get enough fiber, you may need to strain more to pass stools (like if you are feeling constipated). That could put added pressure on your colon, leading to the diverticula, the A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia reported.Diverticulitis is treated depending on its severity. If it can be treated at home, a doctor may prescribe you antibiotics, lost of rest and a liquid diet, the Mayo Clinic reported. But severe cases of the condition may require hospitalization and surgery to remove a section of the colon. This is not Van Halen's first medical issue -- he battled tongue cancer about a decade ago, People reported. "

If you lose a bunch of weight, you'll likely want to buy",2012-08-31,"Overloaded suburban garage. Boxes, coolers, sporting gear and more.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c35662400003200531cf2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For many of us, removing clutter from our homes is a huge problem. We've told ourselves (and everyone else) a million reasons why we just can't part with certain items. Gretchen Rubin comma author of the best-seller The Happiness Project, wants to put an end to our excuses. Her new book Happier at Home will be available on September 4th, and below, in anticipation, we're re-publishing a post she originally wrote on her blog, The Happiness Project.  One of my key realizations about happiness, and a point oddly under-emphasized by positive psychologists, given its emphasis in popular culture, is that Outer order contributes to inner calm. More than it should.After all, in the context of a happy life, a messy desk or house is a trivial problem--yet I've found, and other people tell me they feel the same way, that getting control of the stuff of life makes me feel more in control of my life generally. (Even if this is an illusion, it's a helpful illusion.) But as much as most of us want to keep our home, office, car, etc. in reasonable order, it's tough. Here are some myths of de-cluttering that make it harder than it needs to be.Myths of Cluttering:1. ""I need to get organized."" No! This is not your first step! Don't get organized.2. ""The more organized I am, the better."" I fully appreciate the pleasure of having a place for everything, and perhaps counter-intuitively, I find it easier to put things away in an exact place, rather than a general place (""the third shelf of the coat closet,"" not ""a closet""). However, this impulse can become destructive: if you spend a lot of time alphabetizing your spices or setting up eighty categories for your home library, consider simplifying your approach. Also, some things simply won't stay organized, so it's not even worth trying; I've spent hours sorting magic markers and Calico Critters pieces, only to find everything a jumble the next day.3. ""I need to run out and buy some inventive storage containers."" See #1. I love cunning containers as much as anyone, but I've found that if I get rid of everything I don't need, I often don't need a container at all.4. ""I need to find the perfect recipient for everything I'm getting rid of."" True, it's easier to let go of things when they're going to a good home, but be wary of letting this kind intention become a source of clutter, itself. I have a friend who has multiple piles all over her house, each lovingly destined for a particular recipient. This is generous and thoughtful, but it contributes mightily to clutter. Try to find one or two good recipients, or create some kind of rigid system for moving stuff along quickly.5. ""I can't get rid of anything that I might possibly need one day."" How terrible would it be if you needed a glass jar and didn't have one? Do you need gigantic stores of rubber bands or coffee mugs?6. ""Someday, I might get that gizmo fixed."" Face it. If you've had something for more than six months, and it's still not repaired, it's clutter.7. ""After I lose some weight, I'll fit into these clothes again."" If you lose a bunch of weight, you'll likely want to buy a new pair of jeans, not dust off the pair you bought seven years ago.8. ""I need to keep this to remind me of the past."" I'm a huge fan of mementos; remembering happy times in the past gives you a big happiness boost in the present. But ask yourself: do I need to keep all these t-shirts to remind me of high school, or can I keep a few? Do I need to keep a giant armchair to remind me of my father, or can I use a photograph? Mementos work best when they're carefully chosen--and when they don't take up much room!9. ""I need to keep this object to show respect for the person who gave it to me."" You can love someone, but not want to keep a gift from that person. It's okay to pass an item along to someone who will appreciate it more."

Held every four or five years, the 100-day festival embraces the idea that art is not limited to paintings on the wall, and need not be constrained to a museum. Instead, the festival is absolutely unconstrained -- there is so much displayed that you can't possibly see everything. Documenta was first held in 1955, after Kassel was nearly destroyed by Allied bombs during World War II. The exhibition was held in the Freidricianum Museum, then in ruins. The Freidricianum, now rebuilt, is still the center of Documenta today. A room in the Freidricianum dubbed the ""brain"" features the festival's theme: sharing history through art. One painting in the brain is significant not for the landscape it portrays, but for what is underneath it. In Afghanistan, the Taliban prohibits art that depicts animals or humans. Mohammad Yusuf Asefi, a Kabul native, saved about 80 paintings by famous Afghan painters from destruction by painting landscapes over them in water-soluble paint. The Buddhas of Bamiyan, two statues in Afghanistan destroyed by the Taliban in 2001, were not so lucky. But the statues have been reincarnated at Documenta 13. During WWII, the Freidricianum was bombed and nothing was left of the extensive library it housed except burned books. American artist Michael Rakowitz commissioned Afghan stone carvers to turn what was left of the Buddhas of Bamiyan into copies of the books in stone. In conjunction with the project, Rakowitz led workshops in Bamiyan to reintroduce the local community to the art of stone carving, a tradition neglected during years of conflict. The project, called What Dust Will Rise, bridges the catastrophe of one country with that of another.Another room in the Freidricianum is covered in about 900 postcard-size paintings of apples and pears. The drawings are simple, but in typical Documenta fashion, the curator has chosen works that are significant for the meaning behind them. The fruits were painted by Korbinian Aigner, an anti-Nazi German pastor and apple grower who invented new breeds of apples. After an assassination attempt against Hitler in 1939, Aigner dared to say publicly that if the terrorist had been successful, then perhaps a million people would have been saved. Aigner was sent to a concentration camp but allowed to work in the gardens, where he began growing apples. He developed four new strains of apples in the camp and named them KZ-1 to 4, KZ being the German abbreviation for ""concentration camp."" One of the trees was replanted in Kassel.The festival is filled with similar exhibits -- footage of a man who filmed the Arab Spring in Tahrir Square and ended up capturing his murder on video, a mask made by students at an internment camp for Jewish children, nude photographs of a photojournalist who posed in Hitler's bathtub after Germany was liberated -- all pieces that are disguised as art, but tell a larger story. Documenta 13 is being held until September 16, 2012.Getting There: Kassel is 90 minutes from Frankfurt and almost three hours from Berlin by train. Go to Bahn.com to purchase tickets."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c298d26000033007f606d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ever wonder how all those Brazilian beach bums maintain their killer bikini bods? Sure, you'll want to taste some of the traditional feijoada while you're there, but I doubt daily helpings of the pork-laden stew is how they inspired the country's eponymous butt-lift.With acres of lush rainforest and access to both the Amazon River and the Atlantic Ocean, Brazilian cuisine has a cornucopia of exotic and health-friendly fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish and meats to offer its visitors. I enlisted native dietitian and natural chef Anna Maria Forcelini to share some tips on how to experience Brazil's bountiful fresh local foods and unique national cuisine while still maintaining a mostly nutritious, balanced diet (you're still on vacation, after all!). Below are a few of our tips on how to eat well in Brazil:Açai You may have heard of this much buzzed-about superfood, which has found its way into everything from juice and smoothies to supplements and specialty liqueurs here in the States. Is this Brazilian berry really a magic bullet that will reverse aging, kick start weight loss and prevent cancer? Data from current research suggests we might want to be cautious about buying into all the hype; however, the açai berry does have many great nutritional qualities. It boasts a very high anti-oxidant content, plus it's a great source of fiber, protein, heart-healthy unsaturated fats, B vitamins and minerals like potassium and iron. That's a whole lot of good stuff packed into one little berry! Enjoy açai in the northern regions of Brazil, where it is grown, if you want to experience the fruit at its freshest. It is commonly served frozen and mashed in a dish called açaí na tigela (açai in a bowl). Grass-Fed Beef You know the phrase ""you are what you eat?"" Well, logic would then dictate that you are what what you eat eats... which is a slightly (ok, very) convoluted way of saying that what Bessie T. Cow has consumed impacts the nutritional value of her meat when we in turn eat her as a hamburger. Brazil has a thriving beef industry, with ranches run by the gauchos of the south and southeast regions of the country. Brazil is an excellent place to indulge your craving for steak because their cattle are exclusively grass-fed. Studies have shown that in comparison with grain-fed beef, the grass-fed variety has a more favorable ratio of healthy fat to unhealthy fat. And some folks say its tastier too. Head to a churrascaria to get your fix. These barbeque restaurants often charge a fixed price for an all-you-can-eat meal and offer rodízio de carnes service, in which waiters come around with various skewers of meat and carve them onto your plate tableside. Just remember, all beef is relatively high in saturated fat so the rules of moderation still apply (no matter what Bessie had for lunch).Buffet Restaurants Brazilians commonly eat lunch in restaurantes por quilo, buffet restaurants where you serve yourself and pay for the meal by weight. They generally have a wide variety of cold salads and vegetables on offer, plus rice, beans, side dishes and meat. Hitting up restaurantes por quilo with the locals provides two excellent opportunities for eating well. First, it lets you be choosy. Load up your plate with simply-prepared vegetables and lean proteins; take a bit less of dishes that are fried or smothered in rich sauces. Second, it lets you take your taste buds on a tour of Brazil without over committing your stomach. As is the case at any buffet, just be sure that your little tastes aren't adding up to a larger than intended meal. Anna suggests getting to the restaurantes por quilo on the early side to ensure that food is fresh and hot. Come later, and it may have been sitting around for a while. Slow Down One thing I've learned spending time with global nutrition experts is that America's habit of snarfing our food may be a key contributor to our obesity situation. While the ""slow food"" movement and intuitive eating are novel concepts here, they are philosophies that have kept civilizations around the world within their BMI zone for hundreds of years. Slowing down is a key concept in Brazil, where meal time is very important, and most families set aside time to eat together at least once a day. Taking time to be present with your food and your loved ones doesn't have to be a luxury limited to vacation -- numerous studies have shown that there are physiological and psychological benefits associated with eating meals as a family (not in front of the TV), so this is a great way to bring a little bit of the Brazilian lifestyle home with you. Anna says that ""the traditional Brazilian way of eating is really about turning mealtimes into pleasant and enjoyable family and friends-time,"" and that ""eating is considered a pleasure and a way to celebrate everyday life."" Sounds good to me. For more on eating well globally, check out Eat Well Global's suite of nutritionist-led travel apps in the iTunes and Android store, or check in on the blog."
