0,ENVIRONMENT,Rise of the Sneaker Males,"Terrie Williams, Contributor
Eco-Physiologist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sneaker-males_us_5bb1396fe4b09bbe9a5cb6af,"Biology has guaranteed that the energy of youth will erupt with each new generation.  The question is, how should we deal with it?",2013-05-12,"Southern Elephant Seal (Mirounga leonina) male. Gold Harbor, South Georgia",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1396f3c000066000bc07b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a biologist that spends long periods of time surrounded by animals the lines between animal behavior and human behavior can become blurred. It is from this perspective that I have begun to wonder if our society is witnessing an unnatural rise in Sneaker Males. Each spring, what biologists call Sneaker Males wreak havoc on elephant seal colonies along the coast of California. Crawling stealthily on bellies and infused with youthful energy and hormones, these immature male elephant seals have a singular goal, to cheat and steal what they can from adult Bull seals, be it territorial beach space or females. Mack truck-sized Bull elephant seals have spent weeks hauling their 4000 pound bodies onto shore, establishing territories, guarding female seals as they pup and nurse their young, and finally mating. Covered in battle scars, these males defend their borders and occupants religiously. It takes intelligence, consistency and brawn; they are respected by the smaller, weaker beach occupants. All is peaceable in the kingdom until the arrival of the Sneaker Males. When Sneakers move in chaos erupts as vigilant Bulls ward off the younger seals' attack. Other seals scatter in fear, females howl in search of missing pups, and more often than not many are crushed to death in the mayhem. In the ebb and flow of these macro-sized microcosms, it is difficult not to draw analogies to our own society. Sneakers appear to have snuck in. One needs only to look to the headlines from Boston, Newtown, Santa Cruz, Aurora, Washington DC and more. However, unlike the natural order, what was once a disruptive problem child has grown into an unnatural force. Sneaker Males now come armed with weapons capable of immense destruction, an unfiltered voice through social networks, and infamy through the media. Most disturbingly, Sneakers (male and female) have been given license in the absence of strong, honest leadership to guide them. In nature, the level of social disruption by Sneakers is tempered by protective leaders and the unity of pack members. This is impossible in a world where individual critics systematically undermine respect for any leader, where praise for the simple, honest worker is rarely uttered, and cheating is an accepted way of life. Public abuse of our presumed elected leader, the President of the United States, has become sport and fodder for individual gain. Ultimately, it has empowered Sneakers from classrooms to Congress.We live in a win-at-all-costs world, with cheating of all types rampant in our schools, sports, religious groups, and political arenas. An escalator ride in the Nike store past the super-sized photos of our super-athletes illustrates the confusing mix of fallen winners presented to young people. Who is the young Sneaker to look to for guidance and inspiration?  Biology has guaranteed that the energy of youth will erupt with each new generation. The question is, how should we deal with it? In the wild, elder animals keep the young in check, guiding them towards acceptable social behavior and maturity. In our not-so-distant social past such youthful energy was also channeled; young adults were taken into the savannah or to sea by elders to learn to farm, hunt or fish for the greater community, apprenticed into jobs, or drafted into the military. Now, society channels our young through schools where many land in high schools and college campuses looking for inspiration and a chance to ""change the world"".  Although free to do whatever they want, they often stumble in the face of endless possibilities and little consistent mentorship from experienced adults. In being given ultimate control, they spiral into confusion and depression. In this regard, nature has done humans better. Elephant seal Sneakers instinctively take the right path, for a charging two ton Bull leaves no room for interpretation. And the young survive.  As we ponder our next move regarding society's Sneakers consider the natural biology that creates young energy and the resource in passion it provides. Youthful passion can be directed towards saving endangered species, curing cancer or AIDS, solving global climate change, and mitigating world hunger... or fueling terrorist acts. The crossroads for our children occur in the late high school and early college years when they naturally flex their maturing muscles. Which path they choose is up to us. We can invest in new Institutes of Inspiration and jobs that enable our young to emulate strong leaders of unquestioned integrity focused on greater social goals, or we can continue to accept Retreats for Cheaters that guarantee their failure. Mother Nature has demonstrated that she knows best. Perhaps, we should start by pairing our youth with her."

The design of the human brain -- its inherent need to make connections and associations -- gives it a will of its own. ...The artificial barriers between the arts and sciences will melt away under the pressure to know and to express our common reality. Our ideas will become closer to nature, more alive and organic. In any way possible, you should strive to be a part of this universalizing process, extending your own knowledge to other branches, further and further out. The rich ideas that will come from such a quest will be their own reward.This passage came back to me as I watched a dress rehearsal for THE MARCHES! 136th Birthday of Isadora Duncan, presented by Lori Belilove and the Isadora Duncan Dance Company. For one, Isadora Duncan herself was a master. She was a big, rich personality brimming with ideas -- she was a performer, a choreographer, a feminist, an educator, an author, and a philosopher. She was an iconoclast who defied the rigid dance conventions of the time. She invented an open-hearted, graceful form of dance. Her work was so beautiful that it radiated a shocking yet lyrical urgency -- and it forever opened the world to the possibilities of physical, musical expression by the human body.  Duncan was called the ""Mother of Modern Dance"" and her legacy continues with artistic director Lori Belilove's loving ongoing inquiry into Duncan's dance ideals: free-spiritedness married to beauty, philosophy, and humanity. But it wasn't the historical weight of the dance pieces, nor was it the delicious sense of being in the presence of a master alive in her work, that evoked Mastery. Greene's passage resonated in me because of the organic interconnectedness, naturalness, and universality of Duncan's work. Human beings are complex and multidimensional. Our feelings run the gamut from murderous rage and bleak despair to joy, sensual bliss, and unconditional, agape love. Our actions exhibit this huge spectrum. So do our interests. We operate on many levels at once, from the physical to the emotional to the psychological to the social to the political to the spiritual; we are comprised of many selves who can never be separated, and our multifaceted nature entwines us with others. The pieces in the The Marches! abound with this vast, alive sense of our shared humanity. And that's a precious antidote to the fragmentation, specialization, and virtualization of modern life. There was the inherent visual pleasure of well-trained bodies moving through space: long columns of necks, lithe, rounded limbs, fluttering silk tunics. The music -- Berlioz, Schubert, and Tchaikovsky soared around and through the dancers.  Then there were the characteristic Duncan movements and gestures that expand upward and outward from the solar plexus and flow through the body as a whole: uplifted chests, poetically arced arms, impossibly fluid leg lifts and flying leaps. Music and movement were completely integrated to produce a distilled essence of grace: sweetness with purity. It was thrilling to behold. This is great dance, and it is timeless, like any other great work of art, be it the Venus de Milo or Botticelli's Birth of Venus.  The Marches! offers poignant layers of meaning and cathartic experience. This collection showcases Slow March, Isadora's great work of despair and sorrow following the death of her two children in a car crash in Paris. Initially consumed with grief, Duncan summoned her genius to express wrenching loss, which unavoidably besets the human condition. This dance ends with hope and renewal, reminding us of our resilience and our love, which transcends death.  This dance feels particularly relevant to modern life, where death is denied, stigmatized, and hidden. In many places, it's illegal for anyone other than an undertaker to handle a dead body, which is whisked out of sight as quickly as possible, to preserve a deluded sensibility which insists on the callow eternal youth of a beer advertisement. We no longer understand grief. Nothing reminds us of our shared humanity so fully as death, whether it be the deaths of innocents in an accident or at the hands of a gunman or terrorist, or the quiet close of a long life, in the company of family. We all experience the same ultimate fate. It's imperative that those who continue after us remember their strength, that they return to the joy and potential of the moment.  There is a blessing intrinsic to simply being alive and The Marches! embodies that blessing. As director and lead dancer Belilove says, ""Duncan's work is about living life to the fullest. ... You must be present in the moment. You can't be walking down the street, wearing high heels and texting. You can't retreat, you can't be a wallflower. You have to live fully in the moment, doing your best."" Marche Heroique is Duncan's response to World War I, the devastating Great War that would, eventually, morph into World War II and catastrophically shape the 20th century. Duncan was a polymath, seeing the connections between art and civilization, and very much involved in politics. Her dance organically expresses the connection between the body politic and the body human. The dancers wear billowing red tunics that wreak passion onto the very air. They plant flags of humanity which represent a call to protect Europe. Rise to the challenge, this glorious dance proclaims, because the stakes are high. In the end, The Marches! is a rich spectacle that throbs with life, with connections, with provocative commentary on our shared humanity. It illustrates Greene's principles of mastery, and leaves its audience elevated in the process. Catch it at the Ailey Citigroup Theater on May 16, 17 and 18. © Stephen de las Heras"

3,PARENTING,Why Go Back to Work After the Baby,"Dr. Peggy Drexler, Contributor

I'd argue that in many cases, going back to work is not a sacrifice at all but the best decision a woman can make not only for herself, but also for her family.",2013-05-11,Smiling woman working on laptop while baby playing with mobile phone,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d275e2100003300c56746.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Julie always expected she'd quit her job as a technical recruiter as soon as she and her husband, Billy, had kids. Her mom had been a stay-at-home, and so were most of her friends. But once their first child, Mia, was born, Julie began to rethink the notion. Mia was fussy. She needed almost constant attention. Billy didn't pitch in much during the week; he was up early and came home late. His schedule had always been that way, but Julie, exhausted and a bit lonely, began to resent him -- and, in the darker moments, Mia, as well. In those early months of maternity leave, Julie found herself dreaming of the day she, too, could get out of the house and go back to work. But she was torn: ""I couldn't figure out if I was running away, or honoring myself. Or both,"" she told me. At the same time, she blamed herself for not instantly loving all parts of motherhood, and, she said, ""for not just being grateful that we could afford to 'let' me stay home."" The notion of the ""working mom"" is always a hot button topic -- for mothers and others -- and the current discourse is no different, rife with varying opinions, inner conflicts, self-induced guilt, and, inevitably, much judgment. The term ""working mother"" itself carries a sniff of disapproval and feint praise -- no one debates the notion of the ""working father,"" after all. Women tend to feel scrutinized no matter what they choose, and often depending on whom their friends are -- and what decisions those friends make for themselves. It's become a political issue, with some Republicans arguing that only poor moms should work, and some Democrats arguing that wealthy moms who choose to stay home with their kids are self-indulgent. Pop culture is similarly divided: In her much-discussed book Lean In, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg writes that women can ""have it all,"" though not long before, Princeton professor and former director of policy planning for the U.S. State Department Anne-Marie Slaughter, writing in The Atlantic, argued the exact opposite.Of course, whether or not to pursue a career, or hold a job outside of the home, is a very personal and entirely individual decision that depends on many, many factors. But so much of the advice geared towards women who choose to go back to work, including Sandberg's, focuses on how they can learn to accept the sacrifices, some bigger than others, that necessarily go along with working while raising children. Instead, I'd argue that in many cases, going back to work is not a sacrifice at all but the best decision a woman can make not only for herself, but also for her family.Like in Julie's case. Though she always imagined that she'd be content with days spent entertaining and teaching kids, driving them to activities and play dates and, most importantly, simply watching them grow, she realized that she felt she'd lost a great sense of who she was in completely abandoning the side of her that had worked so hard for so long. And that just because she could stay home didn't mean she should. ""I began to miss the satisfaction that earning, and achieving, gave me,"" she said. ""Of course, raising a child was incredibly satisfying, too. But it didn't satisfy all of me."" This is common, especially as more and more working women take on leadership roles and positions of great power. Those who spent years fighting to achieve workplace equality often find that forgoing career for motherhood can feel like a personal betrayal. Or, at least, a life they wouldn't necessarily want for their own daughters. Sara, a mother of two children under 6, left her job as an editor at a New York publishing house to stay home with the children. She loved her new life, having so much quality time with her children, being their greatest influence. ""Until the day when my older daughter came home from kindergarten with a drawing of what she wanted to be when she grew up,"" said Sara. ""And it was me -- a mother. She wanted to be a mom. I wasn't touched -- I was humiliated. 'That's not all I am,' I wanted to tell her. But more, I just desperately wanted 'more' for her. I was like, 'I'm not sacrificing my career to be the perfect mother so that you can grow up and stay home!' And yet that's exactly what I had done."" A year later, she went back to work. That's not at all to say that stay-at-home moms can't, or shouldn't, be role models for their daughters. But while many opponents to working motherhood argue that working moms miss out on much of the opportunity to shape and influence their children, many working mothers know that their personal achievements of any kind -- from schooling to the workplace -- will help rather than hinder their kids. Mothers who pursue professional and personal achievements teach their children the value of independence, perseverance, having a strong work ethic, and doing something you love. These mothers also understand that no parent -- be it mom or dad -- should be all things at all times to his or her child (in fact, even mothers who stay home should actively seek out other role models for their children). Going back to work post-baby is also, for many, a matter of health. A 2011 study published in the Journal of Family Psychology looking at more than 1300 mothers across the U.S. found that working mothers reported fewer symptoms of depression and were more likely to rate their health ""excellent"" as compared with non-employed mothers. In this same study, working mothers also reported being just as involved in their child's schooling as stay-at-home moms, while those who worked part-time provided more learning opportunities for their toddlers than those who didn't work at all. The lesson? The kids will be all right -- maybe even better -- when mom puts herself if not first, then pretty close to the top of the priority list. And let's not forget fathers' contributions to parenting. The number of stay-at-home dads -- about 154,000, according to the 2010 Census -- is on the rise, with an estimated 16 percent of preschoolers being cared for by Dad while Mom is at work. So is the number of female breadwinners, according to the Pew Research Center. Studies show that this new generation of dads views family as the center of their lives -- and that's a very good thing. At the very least, it means that the discourse is about to change. And that if we're going to talk about working mothers, we'll soon be talking about working fathers, too. It's about time.This first appeared on hellogiggles."

5,DIVORCE,The Relationship Advice That Wrecked My Marriage,"Laura Doyle, Contributor
New York Times Bestselling Author,  America's Most-Trusted Int...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-relationship-advice-t_us_5b9d17fde4b03a1dcc84639a,"Here are the three most common, unhelpful pieces of relationship advice along with what I now know are more productive alternatives.",2013-05-11,"Outdoor portrait of Danish woman, 26 years old, screaming with arms on side of head and eyes closed",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d17fd2000004e00fdd3c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every Sunday on my radio show, I give out ""The Worst Relationship Advice of the Week Award"". There's never a shortage of bad advice to choose from, and most of it sounds like harmless conventional wisdom. But bad relationship advice is harmful. I know from applying some of these ineffective suggestions early in my marriage marriage and nearly getting divorced as a result.Of course, the real reason I give out this award is not just to point and laugh at people --although I enjoy that too -- but for the purpose of highlighting the simple skills that have helped thousands of women restore the excitement, passion and fun in their relationships.Here are the three most common, unhelpful pieces of relationship advice along with what I now know are more productive alternatives:1. Institute a date nightGolly, why didn't I think of that? That's right up there with weight-loss tips like ""just eat less"" or financial advice like, ""live below your means."" If life were that easy nobody would need advice.But the noxious subtext of this vacuous advice is that to stay married, you should add ""go on a date"" to your list of chores, right between ""scrub toilets"" and ""clean the garage."" Yay! It reminds me of another unhelpful axiom: ""Marriage is hard work."" But with the right skills, marriage is not drudgery.  This date-night maxim is truly terrible advice because nobody ever felt special and loved when her husband said, ""We should go out once a week to work on our marriage."" A wife who says that to her husband is likely to be met with resistance to date nights because they reek of control and sound like a chore.If you're not exactly enjoying each others' company, how would going out for dinner and a movie change that anyway? Wouldn't you just have a tense night out instead of a tense night in? And wouldn't that make you feel even more hopeless?Here's a more effective practice for re-establishing connection: Instead of a weekly date-night, consider thanking your spouse three times a day for things he does to lighten your load or to delight you. Does he work hard to support the family? Thank him -- even if you work too. Did he start a load of whites? Say ""thanks."" Did he haul the garbage cans to the curb? Let him know you appreciate that.This simple habit does double-duty for restoring connection because it not only helps you focus on what you're grateful for about your spouse, it also inspires him to find more ways to please you -- once he knows you appreciate his efforts.2. Communication is the key to a good relationship  The reason this advice is terrible is because we women typically understand it to mean that we need to talk more to get our man to understand. If we could just get him to sit down and talk about his feelings for hours, we think that would fix everything. This feeds into the female fantasy that if our husbands would just do what we've been trying to tell them to do, everything would be fine. Most husbands would rather eat old horse blankets than have that conversation.If your husband avoids conversations about your relationship, you might worry that it's because he's defective, and that for some reason, you didn't notice until after you were married.Relationships benefit greatly when you don't communicate everything you're thinking, especially if it's critical or disrespectful.Instead of trying to force a conversation with your husband, consider focusing on what's true for you and expressing it without criticism. Phrases like, ""I miss you,"" when you're lonely will do more for your connection as a couple than a complaint like, ""we never spend any time together."" Saying ""ouch!"" instead of ""you're really oblivious and insensitive!"" when he hurts your feelings will go a long way toward keeping the peace and preserving the emotional safety, which is critical to intimacy.And here's some marriage advice you don't often hear: When you find yourself tempted to correct your husband or tell him what he's doing wrong, zipping your lips until the urge passes.3. You should go to marriage counselingI know a divorced advice columnist who is always suggesting this. It didn't work for her, but she hasn't given up hope that it will work for somebody else.There's nothing wrong with wanting professional help, and we've all been taught that marriage counselors are where we should turn when the relationship has left Happily-Ever-After Highway. But I, for one, have lost my faith in a diploma as a reliable sign of relationship wisdom. Doubt crept in the day I glimpsed the inside of our counselor's marriage and saw her horrifying contempt and disrespect for her husband. It was confirmed the umpteenth time a client told me that her marriage counselor shamed her into getting a divorce, or listened to her complain about her guy every week for a year and never asked her to make any changes. Another counselor told my client she herself was getting divorced and recommended her client figure out where all the assets were immediately.Granted, some divorces are necessary. If you're not safe, you have to get out. But instead of taking advice from someone who studied relationships academically, consider checking for the most important credential of all: A happy relationship. Only a woman who actually enjoys the ease and pleasure of a great connection with her husband can tell you how to have that. But there's a pretty good chance such a woman knows a few things that will help, even if you think your situation is hopeless. Maybe you've just been following the wrong advice.To learn more about how to start making your marriage fun again, get Six Lessons for Lasting Love free at lauradoyle.org."
6,WELLNESS,Make the Offering,"Rick Hanson, Ph.D., Contributor

When you relate to everyday actions as offerings, you feel an intimacy with the world.",2013-05-11,"A young woman and an old woman, probably grandmother and granddaughter, with linked arms, chat happily to each other, laughing as they walk through a sunlit forest. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d20fa2500003200365576.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What could you offer?  The Practice:  Make the offering.  Why?One of the strangest and most meaningful experiences of my life occurred when I going through Rolfing (10 brilliant sessions of deep-tissue bodywork) in my early 20s. The fifth session works on the stomach area, and I was anticipating (= dreading) the release of buried sadness. Instead, there was a dam burst of love, which poured out of me during the session and afterward. I realized it was love, not sadness, that I had bottled up in childhood -- and what I now needed to give and express.We can hold back our contributions to the world, including love, just as much as we can muzzle or repress sorrow or anger. But contribution needs to flow; it stagnates and gets stinky if it doesn't. Thwarted contribution is the source of much unhappiness. For example, the wound of loneliness and heartache is about not having others to give to as much as not having others to get from. And one of the major issues with adolescence in technological cultures is that there are few opportunities for teenagers to make a real difference, to matter and feel a sense of earned worth.Now, ""contribution"" covers a lot of ground. It includes big things like raising a child, inventing the paperclip, or composing a symphony. But mainly it's a matter of many little things. You give or receive hundreds of small offerings each day, such as doing the dishes, treating customers with respect, picking up a gum wrapper, encouraging a friend, having good intentions, or staying open to feedback. You contribute with thought, word, and deed, and both by what you do and by what you restrain yourself from doing.In addition to the offerings you already make, you may sense other things inside that want to be offered. Can you open to these and let them flow? It does not matter how large or small they are. As Nkosi Johnson -- a South African boy born with HIV who became a national voice for children with AIDS before dying at about age 12 -- once said: ""Do all you can, with what you have, in the time you have, in the place where you are.""How?Appreciate some of the things you already contribute through thought, word, and deed. Let yourself feel good about this.Moving through your day, try considering your contributions as offerings -- particularly the little things that are easy to overlook, such as the laundry, courteous driving, or saying thanks. When you relate to everyday actions as offerings, you feel an intimacy with the world, more kindness, perhaps even something sacred.Also try on a sense of being unattached to the results of your offerings. Sure, it's OK to hope for the best. But if you get fixed on some outcome, it's a setup for pressure and disappointment. I got a good lesson about this from my friend David, who was becoming a priest in an urban zen center and preparing for his first public talk. I asked David if it bothered him to work hard to present something precious to people who might not value it. He looked at me like he could not understand my question.

I hope it's helpful, but that's out of my hands.""It's alright to make offerings from enlightened self-interest. When you give, you receive. Which helps you keep giving. To be benevolent to others, you must be benevolent to yourself.Also listen to your heart for additional offerings calling to be expressed. Maybe it's the offering of never speaking out of anger, or really starting that novel, or determining to give love each day. It could even be an offering to your future self -- the being above all others you have the greatest power over, and thus the highest duty to -- such as regular exercise or taking steps toward a better job.Help yourself sustain this practice by feeling good about your contributions, regarding actions as offerings, staying focused on a key new offering, and holding self-criticism at bay.

Whenever possible, sleep when your infant sleeps. Many women look at their baby's sleep time as an opportunity to catch up on their list of essential chores, tasks, and activities. Keep sleep at the top of this list.",2013-05-11,2013-05-10-mother_and_child_by_gustav_klimt_336.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-05-10-mother_and_child_by_gustav_klimt_336.jpg,"This past year, I watched my daughter-in-law, Adriana, proceed through her second pregnancy, childbirth and the care of our family's lovely newborn, Eva. I watched her struggle with some of the most common challenges of motherhood, including of course, disrupted sleep. As Mother's Day draws near, I'm remembering the many mothers, both new and seasoned, who have come to me with sleep concerns. Partially due to hormonal fluctuations, women have 40 percent more insomnia than men. Both menstruation and menopause are associated with an increased risk for occasional sleeplessness as well as insomnia. It's not at all uncommon for teen girls to encounter sleep challenges with the start of menses. The majority of middle-aged women I worked with over the years had sleep problems stemming from perimenopausal symptoms. Obviously, women are at even greater risk for insomnia when they become mothers. Because sleep struggles are so common during pregnancy, sleep doctors facetiously refer to it as a sleep disorder. And the normal feeding schedules of healthy infants will fragment mom's sleep for those first few months, not to mention the throes of weaning and shifting routines. Even under the very best of circumstances and with optimal support of partners, spouses or other family members, pregnancy, childbirth, nursing and infant care will, to varying degrees, disrupt sleep. It's not at all surprising that women come to depend quite heavily on prescription sleeping pills. IMS Health reports this dependence peaks from age 40 to 59, resulting in more than 15 million prescriptions per year. And this figure does not account for millions of additional prescriptions of off-label sleep drugs, OTC medications and the excessive consumption of alcohol and marijuana as sleep elixirs.The sleep loss normally associated with motherhood is, simply put, natural. Mother Nature (who also happens to be a mother) has genetically endowed women with the resilience to handle this. Adriana didn't seem all that surprised when I explained that women are biologically programmed to obtain significantly more deep, slow-wave sleep than men both over the course of a night and a lifetime. As a result, women perform better and rebound more quickly than men when sleep-deprived. Still, when their energy does rebound, mothers tend to overdo it. While archetypal images of motherhood like the Klimt painting above convey a sense of tranquility and serene union, the image of the modern mother is more of a sleepy-eyed pit bull with lipstick racing her minivan across town to get the kids to soccer. But what if the problem of maternal insomnia is not entirely about insufficient sleep and as much about the unmitigated expenditure of energy?In nature all things ebb and flow. Contemporary culture encourages us to go with the flow, but offers little regard for the ebb. In contrast, the experience of menses, pregnancy, childbirth, nursing and infant care all insist that mothers learn to temper going with the flow by intentionally slowing with the ebb. Just as we must learn to walk before we can run, we must learn to slow before we can sleep.Try to do so naturally, avoiding OTC and prescription sleeping medications whenever possible. In truth, they simply don't work well and are detrimental to our long-term health. If necessary, consider the judicious use of more natural alternatives like melatonin, valerian, and L-theanine. Judicious means becoming well-informed and only using such alternatives in the context of a comprehensive sleep health program. Be aware that, whether intentional or not, you are teaching your children about sleep through the critical process of role modeling. Do so consciously. Your attitude, practices and overall value of and relationship to sleep are potent lessons that will impact your child's future sleep habits. In contrast to prevailing beliefs, consider that sleep is inherently a social experience. Bear in mind that during pregnancy you are actually sleeping for two. Whenever possible, sleep when your infant sleeps. Many women look at their baby's sleep time as an opportunity to catch up on their list of essential chores, tasks, and activities. Keep sleep at the top of this list. Allow your child to teach you about sleep, as well. To remind you of the power, nearness and forgotten mystery of it. Take time to simply watch your baby sleep. Gaze into those fluttering eyes, cuddle those limp limbs and watch that twitchy breath find its restful rhythm. Children, especially very young ones, most beautifully demonstrate something so many adults seem to have lost touch with -- that instinctual ability for absolute and unequivocal surrender to sleep. Last night I watched Adriana gazing at Eva as she nodded off. This, I thought, is most certainly the essence of Mother's Night.For more by Rubin Naiman, Ph.D., click here.For more on sleep, click here."

Ritter defended gay rights in a Facebook post criticizing Messiah College, a private school in Mechanicsburg, Pa., that embraces the ""evangelical spirit rooted"" in Christian traditions. In his May 4 post, Ritter blasted the school as anti-gay after discovering a school-wide document called the ""Community Covenant."" Messiah College requires all students to sign a ""Community Covenant"" promising to, among other things, “avoid such sinful practices as…homosexual behavior….” This policy, which I see as exclusionary and bigoted, could not run more counter to my personal beliefs. If I had done my homework, and read about Messiah's policies ahead of time, I would never have agreed to play there.Ritter -- who performed at the school on May 4 -- continued by saying he would not play at Messiah College again until the school welcomes all Christians, gay or straight. He plans to donate the fees he received for the performance to suicide-prevention group the Trevor Project. Messiah students are now striking back at Ritter saying their school is actually an accepting place. ""[Y]ou have succeeded to put all of us Messiah students in a box, when in reality this characterization couldn't be further from the truth. The student body here is a diverse group, many of which are passionate for seeing change happen within the schools policies regarding homosexual behavior,"" wrote one Facebook user. ""Your words are hurtful to many of us here who do not apply to the group you called out.""""I love Messiah, and I love my faith, but I also believe that everyone has the right to love who they love and to be with you makes them happy,"" wrote another. ""If you ask around campus, there are many things that students generally disagree with in the Community Covenant.""Messiah has a copy of the ""Community Covenant"" available online. This document, subtitled ""All of Life Under the Lordship of Christ,"" says that the teachings of the scriptures apply to all those in the school community. Students are asked to avoid: drunkenness, stealing, dishonesty, profanity, occult practices, sexual intercourse outside of marriage, homosexual behavior, and sexually exploitative or abusive behavior. A spokeswoman for Messiah told Christian magazine World on Campus that she was surprised Ritter wasn't familiar with the school's stance on sexuality until now, even though he performed there in 2009. ""We are a Christian college, we would think it wouldn't be surprising that we hold a traditional Scriptural interpretation of sexuality,"" Beth Lorow said. ""We feel disappointed that he opted to publicly express his disagreement with name-calling and labeling and passed on doing it in a more productive way.""She said Ritter refused to speak to school administrators about his differing opinions and accused him of ""not extending the openness and tolerance he spoke about to religious freedoms.""

""The same thing happened to my mother when she learned that Reshma was still alive.""Major Moazzem Hossain, who was involved in the rescue, said Begum had managed to say a few more words on Saturday about her ordeal.""At some point I fell asleep but suddenly I woke up and it was difficult to know whether it was day or night,"" Hossain quoted Begum as saying.Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Morshed, a military physician, said that Begum was recovering well. ""Her kidneys and other essential organs are working normally though she is suffering from acute dehydration,"" Morshed told Reuters.Live televised scenes of Begum's salvation transfixed Bangladesh, where waves of grief have rolled from the disaster site to engulf far-flung villages where many of the young women and men who staffed the sewing lines were born.In common with other relatives of the missing, Begum's family had travelled from their village to gather at a schoolground near the ruined factory in Savar, a gritty industrial suburb outside the capital Dhaka, where families kept a sombre vigil for their missing loved ones.Hours before Begum was found, emergency crews had pulled the 1,000th corpse from the heap of rubble, twisted metal and machinery. The army said the death toll from the April 24 collapse, the world's worst industrial disaster since Bhopal in India in 1984, had reached 1,089 by Saturday.When word spread that a woman, identified by Bangladeshi media at first only as ""Reshma"", had been found - trapped but alive - her relatives began to believe the unimaginable. SEEKING HER FORTUNEBegum's journey to the factory floor was typical of a generation of young Bangladeshi women who have sought to escape lives of rural drudgery by winning jobs in a burgeoning garment industry, tempted by by the prospect of regular wages even if safety standards are sometimes lax.Islam, 33, said their family lived in a village called Koshi Gari, 414 km (259 miles) north of Dhaka. He had found a niche selling sweet fried cakes to local children, but Begum dreamed of a new life in the big city.Three years ago, Begum moved to Dhaka, Islam said, joining several million women working in factories that supply retailers including Walmart Stores Inc, Tesco Plc and H&M .After finding her first job she married, Islam said, but her husband began to pilfer her earnings and she soon left him.""He beat her brutally, which forced her to divorce him,"" Islam said.On April 2 this year, Begum found a job at New Wave Bottoms, a garment maker on the second floor of Rana Plaza, the doomed building, which imploded a day after its owner assured nervous workers it would stand ""for a century"".Hossain, the army officer, said Begum had not packed the home-made lunch that garment workers customarily prepare. She had, however, been carrying four small packets of biscuits and a bottle of water - provisions that would save her life.Islam said the family had given up hope Begum would be found alive, and had only cherished the wish that they would finally be reunited with her remains.""For the last 17 days, we have been waiting to get her body to take home and to bury at our family graveyard,"" Islam said.

Goldman argued that the information was sensitive and should not be seen by journalists.""Having recognized this mistake, we took immediate action,"" Doctoroff said in the statement posted on Bloomberg's blog. ""Last month we changed our policy so that all reporters only have access to the same customer relationship data available to our clients.""The questions about Bloomberg reporters' access have moved beyond Wall Street banks. The New York Times, citing people briefed on the matter, reported that banking regulators at the U.S. Federal Reserve are examining whether their own employees were subject to tracking by Bloomberg reporters. A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.Doctoroff said Bloomberg also created a new position of client data compliance officer to continue to ensure that its news operations never have access to confidential customer data.No clients had canceled their subscriptions because of the issue, a person briefed on the situation said on Friday.Privately held Bloomberg has about 2,400 journalists worldwide. The company gets the bulk of its revenue from terminal sales to financial institutions. It has more than 315,000 terminal subscribers globally. Last year it posted revenue of $7.9 billion.Thomson Reuters' , the parent of Reuters News, competes with Bloomberg.In a statement, Thomson Reuters said the news division operates ""completely independently with reporters having no access to non-public data on its customers, especially any data relating to its customers use of its products or services.""Thomson Reuters collects and analyses customer data to improve product functionality and customer experience.

In the wake of the deadly collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh last month, the company’s famously blunt chief executive is dialing up the rhetoric more than ever, accusing his competitors of the worst forms of exploitation.""I think man has evolved and we're moving away from slavery,"" American Apparel CEO Dov Charney told The Huffington Post this week. ""This situation of manufacturing clothing and paying wages that won't even buy you an iPhone after a year is not going to work. Start making clothing in a human way.""Charney has been loudly touting his brand's devotion to ethical, American manufacturing since the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building in an industrial suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh, took the lives of more than 1,000 people. American Apparel released an ad to remind consumers that the brand is ""sweatshop free,"" along with a letter from Charney admonishing his counterparts in the apparel industry for unflinchingly chasing cheap labor around the world.Although it manufactures all its garments domestically, American Apparel's reputation is far from spotless. Workers at the American Apparel factory in Los Angeles make an average of $12 an hour, according to the company. Though a few dollars above California's $8 minimum wage, that's just 94 cents more than the poverty-level wage of $11.06, according to 2011 data from the Economic Policy Institute. Moreover, the company stands accused of blocking union activity and chasing organizers off its premises.Advertising watchdogs also have criticized American Apparel for its overtly sexual marketing tactics, and Charney has faced several lawsuits alleging sexual harassment, which he famously proclaimed were a ""testimony to his success.""""I'm not an angel,"" said Charney. ""I'm a normal guy, but we're paying a fair wage or at least attempting to pay a fair wage. We haven't nailed it, but we're trying to do it.""He contends that in recent years other apparel companies have chosen to limit their direct manufacturing, effectively converting into ""design, distribute and sell"" operations, in order to lower costs and save themselves from dealing with the ebb and flow of managing production lines.""This is the apparel industry -- it's all about deadline,"" said Charney. ""You've got to get these sweatshirts or this swimwear by a certain day, or you're nailed, and you're out of business.""The pressure on third-party manufacturers like those in Bangladesh has reached a breaking point, according to Charney. Strict cutoff dates and lack of cooperation from retailers has pushed factories in poor countries to their limits, forcing them to do whatever it takes to get the job done, he said.""There's no 1-800 number to call [Canadian retailer] Joe Fresh and say, 'Hey, my building's falling apart and it might be unsafe,'"" he added.It's a sharp contrast to the situation in the U.S., where a variety of watchdogs -- from government agencies like the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to the probing eyes of the media -- are supposed to force U.S. manufacturers like American Apparel to keep things in line. Charney argued factories halfway across the world in Bangladesh aren't under the same sort of scrutiny, allowing manufacturers to get away with whatever they want.""If there's something unsafe at my factory I'm shutting that thing down,"" he said. ""If not, one wrong move and it's all exposed. That's a good thing. That's not a bad thing."" American Apparel knows this firsthand. The company had to let go a large chunk of its workforce in 2009 after an investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revealed that thousands of employees were unauthorized to work in the country.Despite his criticism of overseas manufacturing, Charney said apparel retailers shouldn't pull their business out of countries like Bangladesh; they should instead stay to help boost the local economy and provide jobs. The problem lies not in the location of the manufacturing, but in the rock-bottom wages and the treatment of workers, he said.""Anything below two or three bucks an hour is outrageous,"" said Charney. ""I don't care where it is in the world. The purchasing power of 10 bucks a week in the poorest of poor locations is bogus."""
