0,POLITICS,Republican Mississippi Senator's Long Political Past Holds Clues His Time May Be Up,Jon Ward,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-cochran-mcdaniel-primary_n_5420201.html,,2014-05-31,"UNITED STATES - APRIL 1: Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., arrives in the Capitol for the Senate Republicans' policy lunch on Tuesday, April 1, 2014. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cb542400005000576f62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A casual observer may be forgiven for wondering how Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), a man known for cordiality and manners almost more than anything else, has held onto his Senate seat for 35 years, and why he is subjecting himself to a brutal reelection campaign for yet another term. Anyone asking this question should start with this: In the last 70 years, Mississippi has had only five U.S. senators. That remarkable fact helps explain why Cochran decided in December, a day before his 76th birthday, to seek a seventh term in the U.S. Senate. “Traditionally, Mississippi -- because of us being one of the poorest states in the union -- the one thing we've always done right is we would elect people to Congress and leave them there and allow them to get seniority and get things for our state,” Brad White, a former state GOP chairman, told The Huffington Post. “ We did that for James Eastland and John Stennis.”Sen. Eastland and Sen. Stennis were, for a time, the longest-serving pair of senators from the same state in U.S. history, until their record for longevity was eclipsed by South Carolina's Strom Thurmond and Ernest Hollings. Eastland, an outspoken segregationist, was elected to the Senate in 1943 and retired in 1978, 35 years later. Stennis entered the Senate in 1947 and served even longer than Eastland, retiring in 1989 after 42 years. If Cochran wins the Mississippi primary on Tuesday, is reelected this fall and serves a full term, he would be the fifth-longest serving senator in the nation’s history. He is currently 25th on the list. Cochran was elected in 1978 to replace Eastland, and has made his mark securing federal funding for infrastructure projects, disaster relief, universities and research centers, and preserving federal contracts for state shipyards and air bases. Cochran and his campaign are emphasizing his ability to bring home the bacon in the closing days of a nasty, bruising primary fight with a 41-year old Republican challenger, state Sen. Chris McDaniel. On Thursday, Cochran was in Pascagoula on the Gulf Coast to play up his role in maintaining the health of Ingalls Shipbuilding, which builds ships for the U.S. Navy and employs 11,000 people. The Cochran campaign is also hammering home the senator’s role in increasing the amount of federal relief funding for Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.“He was there for the state in our darkest hours,” Austin Barbour, a senior adviser to the senator’s campaign, wrote in an email. But for all that, Cochran is in real danger of losing his seat to McDaniel, a feisty, flashy attorney from Jones County in the state’s southeast corner, which was a haven for Confederate deserters during the Civil War. That’s despite a scandal that has rocked the race, in which a 28-year old McDaniel supporter was arrested for breaking in to a nursing home to take pictures of Cochran's wife, Rose, who has lived in the home for 14 years with dementia. Cochran finds himself in political peril for two reasons. While Mississippi tradition may justify another term, Cochran has chosen to ignore or disregard a few details from his own rise to power that may have given him pause about seeking reelection. And second, he misapplied one of his favorite principles about the wisdom of waiting to make political decisions, causing him to wait too long to form a reelection campaign, in stark contrast to the way that other vulnerable incumbents have gone about protecting their seats. In 1978, Sen. Eastland was 73 -- three years younger than Cochran is now -- when former Gov. Bill Waller, who was 52 at the time, announced he would challenge Eastland in the Democratic primary. ""There are so many problems in our country. I happen to believe that a young man who has some stamina and vigor is needed,” Waller said, according to the authoritative book by Jere Nash and Andy Taggart, Mississippi Politics: The Struggle for Power, 1976-2008. ""[Mississippi needs] a fighter who can represent our state in a dynamic manner ... We don't need to relate to tradition.”McDaniel is now making the same argument against Cochran. ""After 42 years, he's become silent,” McDaniel recently said on a local news show, figuring in Cochran’s six years in the House for good measure. ""He's not fighting for conservatism. He's not willing to fight.”""No one in the state can name a single charge that Senator Cochran has led against Barack Obama. What good is seniority if he’s not willing to fight?” McDaniel told The Wall Street Journal. Surprisingly, when Waller leveled his age-based charge against Eastland, the powerful senator agreed. Even more intriguing, Cochran had known for two years that he would. In 1976, Cochran had told Eastland he would run for the Senate, but only if the senator retired. Eastland told Cochran, in confidence, that he would in fact be leaving. “I’ll be too old,” he told Cochran. Furthermore, Cochran’s key supporters have also made age the centerpiece of past campaigns. In 1982, Haley Barbour challenged Stennis, who at the time was 80 years old and had served 35 years. Barbour’s highlighting of Stennis' age was more subtle than Waller had been, but no less obvious. Barbour’s campaign theme, “A Senator for the 80s,"" was a clever play on Stennis’ age. And when Stennis attended a local fair to speak, Barbour supporters covered the fairgrounds with signs congratulating the senator on his recent 81st birthday, and presented him ""with a birthday cake that looked like a raging forest fire -- their paid cameras rolling without pause,” according to the book by Nash and Taggart. Barbour lost that race, but went on to become Mississippi’s governor in 2004. He explored running for president in 2012, and is one of the most formidable Republican political operatives and fundraisers in the nation. He has been a driving force behind raising the money for Cochran’s campaign and for the super PAC supporting Cochran, which is being run by his nephew, Republican National Committee member Henry Barbour.Barbour was quoted in the Nash and Taggart book as repeating a maxim he had first heard from Cochran: ""Never make a political decision until you have to, for things could always change.” That logic has backfired on Cochran in his current campaign. He needed an early start on this campaign, in part because he has never had an overwhelmingly muscular political organization. He gained power in 1978 only with the help of a third candidate. He won a plurality of voters in an election where the Democratic vote was split between an establishment candidate and Charles Evers, brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, who siphoned off a large number of black voters. And Cochran has never been the dominant power broker in the state. He has always played the part of congenial gentleman who has gone to Washington to look out for the state’s interests, while former Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) inherited the Eastland political organization that ran things in the state.Cochran refused, despite entreaties from Republican campaign operatives in Washington as early as last June, to begin setting up a campaign apparatus. He said it would be dishonorable to do so until he was officially a candidate, one source with knowledge of the conversations told HuffPost. As a result, he is now in a position of needing to drive up turnout to counter the intensity of McDaniel’s hard-right activist base, but without the benefit of a ground game or campaign apparatus that has been working to identify and turn out likely voters. “Cochran has focused on being a legislator for the last however long, and he hasn't had an active political operation,” Henry Barbour told HuffPost. “They're trying to ramp something up, but you can't just get to 30,000 feet over night. It takes time.""It’s a stark contrast to the way that other vulnerable incumbents have prepared for a primary challenge this cycle. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is 72, was in full campaign mode before the 2012 presidential campaign even concluded. In September of that year, more than two years before the 2014 elections, he hired a former top aide to then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) as his campaign manager, a major first move toward winning over conservatives and supporters of Kentucky’s junior senator, Paul’s son, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). McConnell, who faces a serious general election challenge in November from Alison Lundergan Grimes, easily dispatched primary challenger Matt Bevin. Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), 70, also had a major challenge when Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, announced she would run against him last year. He was not as prepared as McConnell, but Cheney’s candidacy lit a fire under Enzi and he responded in a way that Cochran never did, one Washington Republican operative said. Enzi went through several media training sessions and dove in to the process of making fundraising calls. In the end, Cheney’s own gaffes and personal issues led to her bow out of the race in early January. Cochran has not been defenseless. While Haley Barbour’s brother, Jeppie, endorsed McDaniel, his sons Austin and Henry have brought significant political experience to the Cochran campaign. The super PAC working for Cochran has bombarded McDaniel with attack ads, countering the millions of dollars being poured into the state by conservative and tea party outside groups on the challenger's behalf. And one Democratic operative who did not want to publicly praise the Cochran campaign said it had ""done a masterful job of utilizing the earned media and the court system here and [Cochran’s] allies to tie the earned media and the indignation associated with the arrests and the disclosure of this effort to McDaniel.""The Cochran campaign is hoping the outrage over the nursing home break-in and exploitation of Rose Cochran will do for them what they cannot do on their own because of a lack of ground game: Drive enough Cochran supporters to the polls for him to survive what has become perhaps the most dramatic election of this cycle.

2,FIFTY,Health Insurance Options for Early Retirees,"Jim T. Miller, ContributorSyndicated columnist, NBC Today contributor and creator of Sav...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-insurance-options_b_5421929.html,"If your yearly income falls below the 400 percent poverty level, the Obamacare insurance marketplace is probably your best option for getting health coverage because of the federal tax credits they offer, which will reduce the amount you'll have to pay for a policy.",2014-05-31,2014-05-31-WhatYouNeedtoKnowAboutObamacareandHealthInsuranceExchanges.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-31-WhatYouNeedtoKnowAboutObamacareandHealthInsuranceExchanges-thumb.jpg,"Dear Savvy Senior,At age 63, I will be retiring in a few months and need to find some health insurance coverage for my wife and me until Medicare kicks in. Is Obamacare my only option?-- About to RetireDear About, There are actually several places early (pre-Medicare) retirees can go to find health insurance coverage -- Obamacare isn't the only game in town. Here are your options depending on your income and health care needs.  Government Marketplaces If your yearly income falls below the 400 percent poverty level, the Obamacare insurance marketplace is probably your best option for getting health coverage because of the federal tax credits they offer, which will reduce the amount you'll have to pay for a policy.To qualify for the tax credits, your household's modified adjusted gross income for 2013 must have been under $45,960 for an individual, or $62,040 for a couple. If your income will drop below the 400 percent poverty level in 2014 or 2015 because of your retirement, it may still make sense to buy coverage through the Obamacare marketplace, even if you don't qualify for the tax credits based on last year's income.To help you see how much you can save, see the subsidy calculator on the Kaiser Family Foundation website. To shop for marketplace plans in your state, visit Healthcare.gov or call their toll-free helpline at 800-318-2596. Outside the Marketplace  If you aren't eligible for the government subsidy, or you want additional policy options to what Obamacare offers, you can also buy health coverage outside the government marketplaces directly through insurance companies, brokers or agents. This option is not available if you live in Washington D.C. or Vermont.These policies do not offer the federal tax credits, but they are required to offer the same menu of essential benefits as Obamacare policies do, and they can't deny you coverage or charge extra for pre-existing health conditions. You might even find slightly lower premiums on outside policies, assuming that you don't qualify for the tax credits.Another possible reason for shopping outside the marketplace is to find a plan that has your preferred doctors and hospitals in its network. Many plans offered in the Obamacare marketplaces provide a very limited number of health care providers. To shop for these policies, contact insurance companies, brokers or agents and ask them if they offer policies that are not available through the government marketplaces. To find a local broker or agent that sells insurance plans, check the National Association of Health Underwriters website which has an online directory. But keep in mind that agents won't necessarily show you all available policies, just the ones from insurers they work with.You can also look for these plans at insurance shopping sites like eHealthInsurance.com or GoHealth.com, which lists plans and providers that may not be listed on Healthcare.gov.COBRA If you only need health insurance coverage for a short period of time before becoming Medicare eligible, another option you may want to consider is COBRA. COBRA coverage allows you to remain on your former employer's group health plan for up to 18 months, but not every employer plan is COBRA eligible. Contact your employer benefits administrator to find out if yours is. In most cases COBRA is expensive, requiring you to pay the full monthly premium yourself. But, if you've already met or nearly met your employer plan's deductible and/or out-of-pocket maximum for the year, and don't want to start over with a new plan; or if you find your employer's health plan to be better or more affordable that the government or off-marketplace options, it makes sense to keep your current coverage under COBRA.

Most of the conflicts in which so many Americans died were fool's errands, wars which the U.S. should never have fought.Few were as tragic or unnecessary as the American Civil War, which 150 years ago was grinding through its bloody final full year. Today most Western governments would not use force to stop peaceful secession -- it is impossible, for instance, to imagine the British military occupying Scotland to prevent the latter's departure from the United Kingdom. But in 1861 mystic nationalism combined with practical politics to impel President Abraham Lincoln to call out northern troops to coerce southern residents to remain in the Union. Abolition only became a war measure as the conflict proceeded.The first year resulted in mere skirmishes compared to the battles to come. The next two years saw combat of increasing intensity, with the conflict's result seemingly in the balance. In the east Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia invaded Pennsylvania before being turned back at Gettysburg in July 1863. Two months later in the west the Confederates won at Chickamauga in Georgia before tossing away the advantages gained from that victory.While the conflict out west remained one of maneuver in 1864, in the east Ulysses S. Grant and the Army of the Potomac battered their way past successive confederate defensive positions at huge cost. For instance, the battle of the Wilderness, from May 5 to 7, caused almost 30,000 casualties. Although Grant had both flanks smashed in and suffered much more heavily than Lee, he moved forward. That resulted in the battle of Spotsylvania Court House, which ran through May 21st. Fighting was even more savage at times, with a similar 30,000 toll. The Bloody Angle entered American lore for the horrific close-in combat.The armies moved again, ever closer to the Confederate capital of Richmond. On May 23 Lee entrenched, creating an inverted V defensive line anchored to the North Anna River. As a result, he could easily reinforce his own forces while Grant had to split his army, leaving both wings vulnerable to a concentrated strike by the Army of Northern Virginia. But what then ensued may have been the most important battle not fought during the Civil War.Lee was sick with an intestinal illness, unable to command. From his bed he murmured: ""We must strike them a blow,"" but he could not order it done. And no subordinate general could substitute for him. Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson had died the previous year. James Longstreet had been wounded while directing an attack in the Wilderness. Richard Ewell, A.P. Hill, Richard Anderson, and Jubal Early all were sickly or otherwise ill-prepared for command.A big victory for Lee would not likely have changed the war's ultimate outcome -- the North's advantages were too great at that stage -- but, argued Dana Shoaf of Civil War Times, had Lee ""succeeded in crushing half of the army of the Potomac, it would have changed the tenor of the war in the east."" Grant likely would have had to retreat, giving the Confederacy some time to recover; another command shake-up might have occurred, given tension between Grant, who oversaw all Union armies, and George Meade, who led the Army of the Potomac under Grant. Any change would have further delayed northern operations. But no attack came and on May 26 Grant moved again, leading to one of his worst defeats, at Cold Harbor. On June 3 Grant suffered around 7000 casualties in just a few minutes when assaulting Lee's nearly impregnable position. The night before the attack pessimistic northern soldiers pinned pieces of paper with their names to their jackets, an informal ""dog-tag"" to identify their corpses after the attack. It was the one battle about which Grant expressed regret in his memoirs.The campaign then moved on toward Richmond and became a siege of Petersburg, to the capital's south. That lasted until March 1865, with Lee's surrender in early April. The war soon ended.The country was again unified, but at the cost of 620,000 or more dead, tens of thousands maimed, vast wealth squandered, and much of the southern states devastated. The federal government had been vastly strengthened, creating the opportunity for even more abusive future expansions of national power. The one indisputable benefit was the end of slavery, which ironically, was a consequence rather than objective of the conflict. Had Lincoln made that a war aim to start, he would have divided the north and might have lost the war.The satisfaction of having ended the horrid practice was tempered by the fact that only one other country uprooted slavery through violence: Haiti, in which a slave revolt ousted French overlords and gained independence. Every other slave society peacefully abolished the practice -- among them Great Britain, which did so three decades before, and Brazil, which did so two decades later. War likely was not necessary to eliminate this great evil from America.If not abolition, then for what was the war fought? Southern partisans argue for the constitutionality of secession, but there is no definitive answer. The more important question is: what justifies killing those seeking to leave a political community? What kind of a republic with a limited government kills dissatisfied citizens to prevent them from leaving? Today most people in the West express horror at the thought of forcibly suppressing peaceful secession.Indeed, many Americans who supported the Union opposed coercion. For instance, famed editor Horace Greeley declared in the New York Tribune: ""We hope never to live in a republic whereof one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets."" Col. Robert E. Lee, offered command of the North's armies, voiced similar sentiments when his home state of Virginia chose to secede: I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than a dissolution of the Union... Still, a Union that can only be maintained by swords and bayonets, and in which strife and civil war are to take the place of brotherly love and kindness, has no charm for me.Moreover, while slavery impelled the seven inner-southern states to leave the union, the outer four, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, acted only after President Lincoln called on them to provide troops to invade their neighbors. Most southern unionists then switched sides -- they wanted no conflict, but if forced to fight it would be to protect their southern neighbors from their northern neighbors. Unfortunately, many people in both sections gaily went off to war believing there would be little bloodshed. Young men raced to join lest the fight be over before they could win glory and impress the folks back home. Three years of bloody combat irrevocably shattered such illusions. After the carnage of the Wilderness campaign, Sen. Henry Wilson of Massachusetts observed: ""If that scene could have been presented to me before the war, anxious as I was for the preservation of the Union, I should have said: 'The cost is too great; erring sisters, go in peace'."" Had he and others like him done so, more than 600,000 brave soldiers on both sides would have lived.Unfortunately, the Civil War was not America's only unnecessary war. In 1898 the U.S. charged into the Spanish-American War and then spent three years killing Filipinos seeking the very independence that early Americans had won in combat. World War I was a foolish imperial slugfest with nothing at stake warranting U.S. intervention. World War II grew out of the one-sided peace imposed through American arms after WWI. Vietnam confused vital and peripheral interests. More recent conflicts, such as Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya have been almost frivolous, wasting thousands of American lives for infinitesimal geopolitical gains.Memorial Day always is an appropriate moment for serious reflection. But it is not enough to affirm the obvious bravery of U.S. military personnel. It also is necessary to expose the recurring misbehavior of U.S. government officials. Sometimes war is a sad necessity, but most often not. This Memorial Day offers an appropriate moment to not just reflect, but act. And insist that statesmen treat military intervention as a last resort, reducing the casualty toll to be commemorated on future holidays.This post first appeared on Forbes online."

""Although I do think those criticisms are groundless, I do appreciate your candor  likewise we will also share our candor.""A senior U.S. defense official said that, despite Wang's opening remarks, the tone of the meeting had been ""businesslike and fairly amicable"".While Hagel went over ground he covered in his speech, Wang spent most of the meeting talking about U.S.-China military-to-military contacts, including Chinese participation in forthcoming military exercises, the official said.The U.S. official said Hagel's speech had been well received by other Asian delegations with the exception of China. ONLY IF PROVOKEDIn Beijing, President Xi Jinping said China would not initiate aggressive action in the South China Sea but would respond if others did, the official Xinhua news agency reported.""We will never stir up trouble, but will react in the necessary way to the provocations of countries involved,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying in a meeting on Friday with Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia.China claims almost the entire oil- and gas-rich South China Seas, and dismisses competing claims from Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. Japan also has a territorial row with China over islands in the East China Sea.Tensions have surged in recent weeks after China placed an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam, and the Philippines said Beijing could be building an airstrip on a disputed island.Japan's defense ministry said Chinese SU-27 fighters came as close as 50 meters (170 ft) to a Japanese OP-3C surveillance plane near disputed islets last week and within 30 meters of a YS-11EB electronic intelligence aircraft.Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said Tokyo perceived an ""increasingly severe regional security environment"".""It is unfortunate that there are security concerns in the East and South China Seas,"" he said. ""Japan as well as all concerned parties must uphold the rule of law and never attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force.""On Friday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pitched his plan for Japan to take on a bigger international security role and told the Singapore forum that Tokyo would offer its ""utmost support"" to Southeast Asian countries in their efforts to protect their seas and airspace.In a pointed dig at China, he said Japan would provide coastguard patrol boats to the Philippines and Vietnam. JAPAN OFFER SNUBBEDWang, China's deputy chief of staff, also snubbed an offer for talks with Japan made by Defense Minister Onodera, the semi-official China News Service said.""This will hinge on whether the Japanese side is willing to amend the erroneous policy towards China and improve relations between China and Japan,"" he said. ""Japan should correct its mistakes as soon as possible to improve China-Japan ties.""The strong comments at the Shangri-La Dialog come as Abe pursues a controversial push to ease restrictions of the post-war, pacifist constitution that has kept Japan's military from fighting overseas since World War Two.Despite memories of Japan's harsh wartime occupation of much of Southeast Asia, several countries in the region may view Abe's message favorably because of China's increasing assertiveness.Hagel repeatedly stressed Obama's commitment to the Asia-Pacific rebalance and said the strong U.S. military presence in the region would endure.""To ensure that the rebalance is fully implemented, both President Obama and I remain committed to ensuring that any reductions in U.S. defense spending do not come at the expense of America's commitments in the Asia-Pacific,"" he said.

Routinely winning and losing followers on both sides of the issue, he has become a touchstone for how we talk about how we want our comics to talk.One thing social media has brought into bold relief lately is the large number of angry, young men who follow comedians like Oswalt, Daniel Tosh and even Stephen Colbert, who have no qualms about sending out hateful messages to women on twitter, often in defense of the aforementioned comedian. This was no more evident than in the days following the great rape joke debate of 2013 between Lindy West and Jim Norton on ""Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell."" After the even-handed and thoughtful conversation broadcast, West's twitter account was inundated with death threats, rape threats and all manner of disgusting comments, which she responded to here.Jim Norton made it clear on a subsequent episode of Opie & Anthony that this was not what he wanted. Similarly, in the wake of the #CancelColbert scandal, Stephen Colbert made an appeal to his fans to stop attacking Suey Park:""Now all of this was started by a hashtag activist, or hashtivist, who has been viciously attacked on twitter and if anyone is doing that for me, I want you to stop right now. She's just speaking her mind and that's what twitter is for...""But these incidents and the many others like them, the response to Daniel Tosh's rape joke incident is another good example, point to a problem that is difficult to address. Is a comedian responsible for the hateful speech that is spewed online by their fans in their defense? How do they respond to those fans who seem unable to react to ideas, as Norton asked, rather than verbally attack individual women?Oswalt's latest twitterversy seems to be an attempt at a solution; to try to level with his more difficult fans and put things in cheeky, yet apt context. Here's his three-part explanation after twitter went into overdrive over the DC/Marvel tweet:What do you think of Oswalt's initial tweet and the response to it? If he'd said it on stage and not twitter would it be any different? Do you think comedians need to begin addressing their more troubling fans or is that not their problem?"

Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling responded to the NBA's attempt to oust him on Tuesday, May 27, 2014, arguing that there is no basis for stripping him of his team because his racist statements were illegally recorded ""during an inflamed lovers' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught."" (AP Photo/Danny Moloshok, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30de72100006401c7aeae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Refiles to add dropped year in which Jobs died in fifth paragraph)By Dan BurnsNEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - Donald Sterling, forced to sell his National Basketball Association team after a lifetime ban for making racist comments, is not going to be remembered as a ""visionary,"" ""icon"" or ""oracle"" - terms attached over the years to renowned business personalities such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett.But Sterling's winning bet on the Los Angeles Clippers 33 years ago means he is in their company when it comes to blowout investment returns.Sterling laid out about $12.5 million for the team in 1981, then a perennial basement dweller called the San Diego Clippers. On Thursday, the family trust now in control of the team agreed to sell it for $2 billion to Gates' successor at Microsoft , Steve Ballmer, more three times its estimated value just a month ago.That's 160 times the amount Sterling paid for the team, or equal to a gross, pretax return of 15,900 percent. With a compound-annual return of more than 16.6 percent at that selling price, Sterling's Clippers rank right up there with many of recent and even distant history's famously winning bets.Using that same chunk of money in early 1981, he could have picked up shares of Apple at a split-adjusted price of $4.27 a piece shortly after Jobs took the company public in late 1980. Jobs died in 2011.But even with the iPhone maker now at $633 a share, Sterling's $12.5 million would be worth just $1.86 billion, or an annual return of 16 percent. So Sterling's done about $144 million, or 60 basis points a year, better with the Clippers.That said, he'd have been well advised to seek out a ""young"" investor working out of the offices of an obscure holding company headquartered out on the U.S. prairie. In early 1981, Sterling could have had shares of Berkshire Hathaway, whose chairman, Warren Buffett, was then 50 years old and still some years from being recognized as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" for around $425 each.Had he done so, that same $12.5 million today would be worth $5.65 billion, an annual return of 20.35 percent.But perhaps the best bet Sterling could have made was with Bill Gates.Microsoft was not an option in 1981, as it did not go public until 1986, at $21 a share. But had Sterling thrown in the towel on his then perennially losing team in 1986 - even at the same price he'd paid for it - his $12.5 million would now be worth $7.3 billion after nine stock splits are taken into account. And that's not including reinvested dividends. BETTER THAN WINEStill, even if he missed the boat on Berkshire and Microsoft, Sterling's pick of the Clippers beat most other investments he could have made at the time - stocks, bonds, gold, property, even wine.For instance, he has beaten:- Stocks:Since the start of 1981, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has risen about 1,315 percent, or 8.4 percent a year.Including reinvested dividends, the S&P has delivered a total return of 1,509 percent, or 8.8 percent a year.The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 1,994 percent, or 9.65 percent a year.- Bonds:The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index has risen 1,385 percent, or 8.5 percent a year.- Gold:Spot gold is up 113 percent, or just 2.3 percent a year.- Wine:Earlier this month, London-based Liv-ex said its Liv-ex Investables Index had gained 1,504 percent, or just under 11 percent a year, since its launch in 1988.- Real estate:New York City real estate appraiser Jonathan Miller says the average Manhattan apartment has gained just 5.75 percent a year in value over the 25 years he has tracked their prices.

The Arizona Republic reports that the new use-of-force policy will require agents to avoid situations where deadly force may be necessary. Examples include refraining from blocking moving vehicles' paths or firing at rock-throwers unless in imminent danger. Additionally, agents will be trained on how to carry and use lighter weapons, while also facing restrictions on taser use. ""This is a monumental victory for border communities advocating for transparency and policy reform,"" Andrea Guerrero, co-chair of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, told the Arizona Republic.The new rules are in response to a critical report that was first obtained by the Los Angeles Times and released Friday, showing that agents were deliberately engaging in those aforementioned types of actions.

The Associated Press broke down how the report was conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit group that advises law enforcement agencies. In total 67 case files, were reviewed on deadly force use from January 2010 through October 2012. Administrative action was taken against employees in two of those cases, while 10 investigations remain open, and the other 55 cases went without any disciplinary action.

Here is the reason the ""US official"" gave for the collapse of the peace process:The negotiations had to start with a decision to freeze settlement construction. We thought that we couldn't achieve that because of the current makeup of the Israeli government, so we gave up. We didn't realize Netanyahu was using the announcements of tenders for settlement construction as a way to ensure the survival of his own government. We didn't realize continuing construction allowed ministers in his government to very effectively sabotage the success of the talks. There are a lot of reasons for the peace effort's failure, but people in Israel shouldn't ignore the bitter truth -- the primary sabotage came from the settlements. The Palestinians don't believe that Israel really intends to let them found a state when, at the same time, it is building settlements on the territory meant for that state. We're talking about the announcement of 14,000 housing units, no less. Only now, after talks blew up, did we learn that this is also about expropriating land on a large scale. That does not reconcile with the agreement.The second comment came from Netanyahu, speaking to a group of young members of his political party. Here's what he said:When I entered the Prime Minister's Office for my second term, I was summoned to Washington. ""Not one brick,"" they told me. I was threatened specifically: ""Not one brick."" The pressure from the international community and the Americans was enormous. I don't think anyone in Israel was under such pressure. And still, after five years on the job, we built a little more than 'one brick.' But the important thing is to do it in a smart way, in a quiet way, without inflammatory statements... A leader knows to stand up to international pressure by maneuvering... What matters is that we continue to head straight toward our goal, even if one time we walk right and another time walk left.It is difficult to fathom how anyone in the US Administration could claim to have been surprised by Netanyahu's behavior. He is not the ""new kid on the block."" Netanyahu was elected in 1996 on a platform dedicated to ending the Oslo peace process. Working with his allies in the American neo-conservative movement who authored his ""Making a Clean Break"" speech to Congress, the new prime minister set out to play the Republican-led Congress against Clinton in order to bury Oslo. In time, Netanyahu succeeded in so distorting the process that he could claim five years later how he ""played the US"" and won. Here is Netanyahu, in 2001, describing how he handled America:I know what America is. America is a thing that can be easily moved, moved in the right direction. They will not bother us. Let's suppose that they will say something... so they say it? Eighty per cent of the Americans support us... We have such support there! And we say... what shall we do with this [support]? Look, the other administration [that of Bill Clinton] was pro-Palestinian in an extreme way. I was not afraid to maneuver there. I did not fear confrontation with Clinton. I was not afraid to clash with the UN.Why anyone would have thought upon his reelection as Prime Minister in 2009 that Netanyahu would be a ""horse of a different color"" is difficult to understand. Yes, he claimed to endorse a ""two state solution,"" but with sufficient enough caveats as to render his endorsement meaningless. And yes, he agreed to a short-term ""settlement freeze,"" but as the facts on the ground made clear, his agreement was full of holes. On the one hand, Netanyahu can be seen as a maneuverer, but in reality, he is an ideologue, relentless in his efforts to maintain control of what he refers to as Judea and Samaria. He will feint to the left or right, as need be, but the key to understanding him is to judge him by his actions, not his words. During Clinton's second term, Netanyahu so tested his patience that Clinton began to apply subtle but real pressure to send the message to the Israeli people that the US could no longer tolerate his behavior. I recall Clinton's frustration when Netanyahu, using the same argument he has used recently, expressed the fear that his government would fall if he agreed to what the US was asking him to do. Clinton knew that if Netanyahu moved toward peace he would in fact lose some hardline supporters. But what Clinton also knew was that Netanyahu would pick up more support from centrist parties. Then, as now, Netanyahu chose to keep his hardline coalition and to forgo peace. Clinton's pressure continued until Israelis got the message and elected a new prime minister. President Obama tried to pressure Netanyahu during his first term, but after the Israeli prime minister played the US Congress against him, Obama relented. If the president still hopes to succeed in his second term, he has a choice to make. Leaving it up to the parties to make peace will not work, because Netanyahu doesn't want peace on any terms other than those that would leave both his coalition intact and the Palestinians as a humiliated and still captive people. If the US is serious, then the only course of action is to apply sufficient pressure to force Israelis to choose between Netanyahu and peace. It's politically risky, to be sure, but unless we are ready to play hardball with Netanyahu, he will continue to play us for the fools he thinks we are."

Among one of Angelou's notable policy stances was her opposition to standardized testing and President Barack Obama's Race to the Top competition, as the Washington Post pointed out this week.Angelou was among 120 authors and illustrators who co-signed a letter to Obama in October 2013, criticizing his administration's education initiatives for placing too much emphasis on standardized testing. In the letter, organized by The National Center for Fair and Open Testing, the authors wrote:We are alarmed at the negative impact of excessive school testing mandates, including your Administration’s own initiatives, on children’s love of reading and literature. Recent policy changes by your Administration have not lowered the stakes. On the contrary, requirements to evaluate teachers based on student test scores impose more standardized exams and crowd out exploration.Launched in 2009, the Race to the Top competition allows districts and states to compete for federal funding in exchange for implementing certain education initiatives, such as adopting higher standards or building new teacher evaluation systems. As the Washington Post notes, Angelou further spoke out against the initiative on MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" “Race To The Top feels to be more like a contest,” Angelou said, “… not what did you learn, but how much can you memorize.”As CBS points out, Angelou and Obama had a somewhat up-and-down relationship. Angelou supported Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primary, although Obama awarded Angelou the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February 2011. However, in 2009, Angelou told Newsweek that Obama's election was an ""indication that [America] may at last be growing up, growing beyond racism, sexism, ageism and all those other ignorances. This is why we see faces radiating with hope.""Following her death, Obama released the following statement: ""Like so many others, Michelle and I will always cherish the time we were privileged to spend with Maya. With a kind word and a strong embrace, she had the ability to remind us that we are all God's children; that we all have something to offer. And while Maya's day may be done, we take comfort in knowing that her song will continue, 'flung up to heaven' – and we celebrate the dawn that Maya Angelou helped bring."" "

Recording its best ever performance in its 34-year existence, the BJP led by Narendra Modi on its own was leading in 283 seats, eleven more than the required half-way mark in the 543-member House, while its allies were ahead in 49 seats. (Photo by Vijayanand Gupta/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13726240000140a51a0b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Indian electorate gave an overwhelming parliamentary majority to a man whom they expect to rule like a president, if not more. Narendra Modi, the newly minted Prime Minister of India and leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, is likely to oblige them, and more. Not only has Modi secured a mandate to be ""strong and decisive,"" but what appeals to the Hindu majority that elected him is his ability to ride roughshod over the processes of government, apparently in the interest of ""good governance.""There is widespread expectation that Modi's aggressive leadership will succeed in pushing through his business-friendly agenda to produce a quick dividend for a country that is going through a ""revolution of rising expectations."" The persona of political machismo was deliberately cultivated by Modi touting his top-down decision-making -- at the expense of ""due process"" -- that accelerated investment in Gujarat, the state he ruled for three terms. Will Modi be able to do the same nationally, contend as he must eventually with a petulant parliament, a jealous bureaucracy and an activist judiciary, all in the view of the noisy national media? More precisely, is the country ready to coalesce around authoritarian capitalism, albeit with trappings of electoral democracy, jettisoning the Fabian democratic model inbuilt in the Indian constitution?There are several reasons why India may be tiring of democracy. About 700 million Indians are below the age of 26, of whom nearly a 100 million joined the electoral rolls within the last five years. For these millennials there is only ""one God, that is GDP,"" as the Economist notes. With a majority of the youth increasingly gravitating to urban centers, caste and other identity politics are being subsumed by the lure of consumerism. Added to this, television, Internet and social media have created an aspirational class that seems unmanageable for the prevailing political and bureaucratic culture.Beyond the immediate provocations, there are also a number of ""objective conditions"" that are conducive to the rise of an authoritarian system. At the outset, Modi's victory can be seen as a triumph of the Hindu ""cultural mainstream,"" over liberals who are deeply rooted in Western intellectual and political tradition. Author and self-styled sociologist Santosh Desai sees Modi's triumph as an expression of collective angst against the liberal elite who regard this cultural mainstream as ""regressive, communal or chauvinistic,"" if not outright illegitimate. And the liberal elite, he says, ""have no natural cultural resonance with the Indian reality."" The cultural mainstream here refers to a vast swath of Hindu India that regards modernity as a mere means for material advancement and doubles down on Hindu civilizational pride, religious rituals, Hindi language and films. If the recent elections were a watershed, it is only because the tables have turned in the long battle between the Hindu Left (reformists) and the Hindu Right (revivalists) that started in the early 19th century when the Hindu reform movement was launched not only to counter the cultural and moral superiority claimed by the ""Christian"" colonial masters, but for the political unification of Hindus seen as a necessary condition for (new) nation building.The reformists under the Congress Party dominated the political landscape for the most part, particularly during the period when Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, held sway. The revivalists, subdued and even ostracized after Gandhi's assassination by a member of its ranks, have rebounded under the BJP in the 1990s. They accomplished this largely by 'scapegoating' the minorities, particularly Muslims, who (since the Partition of India) were merely incidental to what was really a civil war within the Hindu fold. But the significance of the BJP's electoral triumph under Modi is that for the first time the revivalists have come to power on their own steam and on their own terms. Now they will have the opportunity to define and actualize the Hindu idea of the state in all its manifestations.It is not a secret that the revivalist creed advocates an authoritarian state, if not an outright Fascist one with its accent of racial purity and superiority. As essayist and author Pankaj Mishra wrote in The Guardian recently, it was not difficult for Modi to shrewdly deploy the ""idioms of management, national security and civilizational glory"" in a country ""where many revere the author of Mein Kampf for his tremendous will to power and organisation."" Clearly, the cultural mainstream has no qualms about it, lending credence to the long-held suspicion of some about the compatibility of Hinduism with democracy. Mishra, for instance, cites B.R. Ambedkar, the principle author of the Indian Constitution, as saying ""Democracy in India is only a top-dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.""Even if such an assessment seems harsh, there is no denying that India in many respects is an illiberal democracy, with most of the power -- political, bureaucratic, military and corporate -- vested in the upper castes that constitute a mere 18 percent of the population. Most of rural India remains segregated along caste lines and most urban ghettos are divided on a communal basis. Outside of a small Westernized urban middle class, the status of women remains ever so unequal and insecure. Physical and structural violence against marginalized sections of the society is countenanced by the cultural mainstream, if not brazenly, certainly through indifference or hypocrisy. Vigilantism against the behavior or practices that are considered culturally alien, censorship of perceived insult to religious sentiments, and laws against religious conversion, etc. are only a shade less dangerous than how they are prevalent in Pakistan. Against this backdrop, an authoritarian rule by Modi could only make an incremental difference, apparent only to the Westernized liberals. And what kind of systemic form that it is likely to take will depend less on Modi than on the cultural mainstream, whose sense of civilizational superiority has been growing in direct proportion to the growth of GDP, at least over the past two decades. If Modi can redeem his promise of 8 percent growth over the next 10 years, he can have his Hindu India."
