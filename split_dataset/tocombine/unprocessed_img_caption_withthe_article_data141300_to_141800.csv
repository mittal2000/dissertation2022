0,QUEER VOICES,"PrEP Should Be a Fast Idea, Not a Slow One","David Evans and Dana Van Gorder, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prep-should-be-a-fast-ide_us_5bafbb9ce4b0ad769261032e,"We write this post out of fear that without a significant shift in thinking about HIV prevention, PrEP, which refers primarily to taking the HIV treatment Truvada every day to prevent infection, will be a ""slow idea,"" resulting in thousands of people unnecessarily becoming infected with HIV.",2013-10-05,"SAN ANSELMO, CA - NOVEMBER 23: Bottles of antiretroviral drug Truvada are displayed at Jack's Pharmacy on November 23, 2010 in San Anselmo, California. A study published by the New England Journal of Medicine showed that men who took the daily antiretroviral pill Truvada significantly reduced their risk of contracting HIV. (Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbb9c260000360081597d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The brilliant surgeon and author Atul Gawande recently wrote in The New Yorker about ""slow ideas,"" ingenious new ideas that are slowly or never accepted while others flourish quickly. His article made us think instantly of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a new and promising strategy to prevent HIV infections.Gawande's example of the slow adoption of an idea was the difference between the adoption of anesthesia and the adoption of antiseptics in the mid 1800s. With anesthesia, people could be sedated during surgery, which benefited the surgeon as much as the patient. The idea took mere weeks to become a global phenomenon and enter into wide use. Conversely, antiseptic practices, which were burdensome for surgeons and acted against an invisible foe (bacteria) that might or might not cause death, took years to catch on. We write this blog post out of fear that without a significant shift in thinking about HIV prevention, PrEP will be a slow idea, resulting in thousands of people unnecessarily becoming infected with HIV.PrEP involves the use of any anti-HIV agent before, during and usually after sex to prevent infection. Today, PrEP refers primarily to taking the HIV treatment Truvada every day along with using condoms. What we know about PrEP is that even in people who don't use condoms regularly, it can work amazingly well if taken exactly as prescribed. Two studies have found that daily use could be almost 100-percent effective.We don't yet know fully what the acceptance of PrEP will be among men who have sex with men (MSM). Granted, PrEP is far more expensive than a bucket of condoms in a bar's bathroom. Studies are just beginning to determine its impact outside clinical trials and whether PrEP can easily or adequately be provided in real-world settings.What we do know, however, is that very few MSM, and far fewer exclusively heterosexual people, even know about it. And we also know that very few providers have prescribed it -- some of them only reluctantly -- even though they are seeing patients who could clearly avoid infection as a result of using it.Even though Truvada as PrEP was approved by the FDA last summer, only about 1,700 people in the United States have taken it outside carefully controlled research projects. Given that roughly 50,000 people, most of them MSM, become infected every year, this is far too few to make a dent in the epidemic, and that's extremely unfortunate.We are not arguing that everyone should start taking Truvada any more than we are arguing that people should abandon condoms. Rather, what we are saying is that, despite modern antiretroviral therapy, HIV is an expensive, stigmatizing and challenging disease to treat. HIV-positive people risk side effects from long-term treatment and the low levels of virus that continue to reproduce despite that treatment. Any new case of HIV infection averted is beneficial for the individual and society as a whole. Every meaningful opportunity to prevent a case of HIV infection should be greeted with pleasure. The opportunity to implement PrEP should be met with great excitement and a sense of urgency.We can endlessly wish or expect that people will consistently use condoms in order to prevent HIV infections from occurring, but it is unrealistic and dangerous to think that we will ever effectively guarantee this. Rates of unplanned pregnancy are evidence enough that people are not always in perfect control of their sexual behavior in the face of love, lust or even pressure.Some HIV care providers and prevention workers appear to be acting as gatekeepers for PrEP, out of a belief that condoms should be enough to stop the epidemic, or out of concern that this intervention will further decrease condom use. Recent cases we are aware of make this plain, where doctors who should know better refuse to give PrEP to those who need it.Also, comments on blogs reacting to people describing their PrEP use have been accusatory and absolutely reprehensible, essentially a new version of slut shaming. Many of these same critics who condemn PrEP users would vigorously argue that women have an unfettered right to choose the form of birth control method that best suits them, and that providers have no right to impose their personal views on such intensely personal decisions. We do not have the luxury of allowing PrEP to become a ""slow idea"" that takes years to be implemented, or -- as with its sister intervention, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which is emergency treatment after exposure -- never really gets implemented at all. We have known for nearly two decades that people exposed to HIV are far less likely to become infected if they immediately take a course of antiretroviral therapy for about a month. Yet a hospital in New York City recently spent hours dithering over whether to offer this intervention to a man who had definitely been exposed to the virus. One of Gawande's suggestions for speeding up the adoption of new technologies is an ""each one teach one"" approach, whereby people engage with others to help spread the new idea. We hope that you, the reader, will become knowledgeable about PrEP, not just for yourself but in order to suggest consideration of it by people you care about who might otherwise become HIV-infected. We hope that if you see articles or blog posts in which people honestly describe their positive motivations to use PrEP, you will praise them for acting responsibly rather than condemning them for doing something transgressive. We hope that you will join with us to support the right of HIV-negative people to choose which forms of prevention they use. And we hope you will tell your providers about PrEP and its promise and encourage them to offer it to patients who might benefit from it. More information about PrEP and short videos about it are available at projectinform.org/prep or myprepexperience.blogspot.com."
1,QUEER VOICES,Desperately Seeking Music Equality: Looking Beyond Macklemore's 'Same Love' Success,"Emma Joslyn, Contributor
Student, Stanford University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/desperately-seeking-music-equality_us_5bafbb98e4b0ad76926101e0,"Queer recording artists who have been singing out loud before any major media outlet would have celebrated it, and who write about the wide range of issues that plague the LGBTQ community, truly represent the rawness of our diverse community.",2013-10-05,"NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 25: Ryan Lewis (L) and Macklemore pose with Best Hip Hop Video, Best Video With A Social Message and Best Cinematography awards in the press room at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards at the Barclays Center on August 25, 2013 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbb9824000050009691f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether or not you actually watched this year's MTV Video Music Awards, I'm going to assume that if you've found yourself reading this blog post, you have come across other people talking about the notorious award show and its many controversial moments. Miley Cyrus probably takes the cake for greatest conversation starter; from the slut shaming she attracted to the cultural appropriation inherent in her performance, she provided ample material for Tumblr users and newsreaders for weeks. But the tense relationship between identity and music is deeper and more complex than the debate over Cyrus suggests. The VMAs were steeped in all kinds of appropriation, and they suffered from an utter absence of diversity. Cyrus was not by any means the sole offender. Most glaringly, as The Huffington Post's Danielle Cadet pointed out last month, not a single award winner was black. Not one. I was also hard-pressed to find LGBTQ artists on my screen. The combination of this apparent homogeneity with a straight, white artist like Macklemore winning a Moon Man for a song about same-sex marriage left me feeling uncomfortable at best. His dominating presence at the award show and in the mainstream music industry calls for another conversation about diverse identities within the music world.The issue is not that he performs a song about the queer equality movement. His video for ""Same Love"" was the obvious winner for ""Video With a Message"" given its popularity, viral outreach, and content. Support is support, and I don't really feel the need to cut him down for using his fame to advocate for an important cause. Celebrities do that all the time. Sure, Macklemore and his producer Ryan Lewis made a pretty penny from the song's success, but I'm willing to take the popularity as an indication of America's shifting viewpoint on sexuality and not as a slimy moneymaking move on the part of the artist. Plus, Mary Lambert, who is featured on the track, is an out lesbian who writes about the social issues that affect her as a queer woman all the time. She's not the one getting the credit, though, which brings me to my next point.Here's the deal. Macklemore is not the first person to write a great song that could be celebrated as the gay marriage anthem. There are documented recordings by queer artists singing about queer issues (read: their lives) that date back as far as the 1920s, and there is an alliance of out queer artists who continue to sing out loud. They have read the YouTube comments lately, and they do have plenty of reasons to think that hip-hop hates them. We're used to seeing images of attractive white people as the faces of the movement for LGBTQ equality. We're used to getting excited when another straight, white person says they support our equality movement, because it's certainly better than the alternative. But forgive me if I'm tired of doling out cookies to everyone who isn't a bigot. Most of these celebrities charge events a ""nominal fee"" to the tune of $10,000 or more as compensation for standing for equality, and much of their support goes to causes like marriage equality, which benefit well-off, white gay people most significantly. Queer recording artists who have been singing out loud before any major media outlet would have celebrated it, and who write about the wide range of issues that plague the LGBTQ community, truly represent the rawness of our diverse community. It would be nice if Macklemore and his crew could give them a shout-out and acknowledge that Macklemore's ability to get his message out so beautifully had something to do with him being a white, straight, cisgender man. If you really want to do something about the equality movement in music beyond just watching the VMAs offer up a token moment of social awareness, you can start off by supporting out and proud LGBTQ recording artists whose songs and lyrics are the soundtrack to the equality movement. I just learned about OUTMUSIC - The LGBT Academy of Recording Arts (LARA). They have a Kickstarter campaign going on right now to help fund their music documentary film For Which WE Stand (One Queer Music Nation in the Visible), which is specifically about the history of queer recording arts. OUTMUSIC/LARA was forged by life partners Dan Martin and Michael Biello in 1990 and is now headed up by Diedra Meredith, who is rarely mentioned in the tokenized and selectively publicized ""lists"" of leaders in the movement for LGBTQ equality. This organization features a diverse group of queer artists who paint a much more vibrant picture of what LGBTQ life looks like, sounds like, and feels like. They support, honor, and celebrate recording artists like Nhojj, an R&B artist who became the first gay indie artist to reach the number-one spot on MTV's Music Top 100 chart in 2010. Other artists they support include Christine Martucci, who also topped the music charts; Jamaican reggae fusion artist Diana King, who rocked her home country when she came out last summer; transgender rap artist Foxx Jazell; and multiple-Billboard-Top-5-chart-topping indie recording artist Jason Walker, whom record executives have referred to as very talented but ""too gay.""My aim is not to cut down Macklemore but to raise up the artists who have been trying to get the message out all along. I want to see a more accurate and diverse picture of both the mainstream music and queer communities. The best thing we can do is to support the LGBTQ recording artists whose identities are conveniently utilized by artists like Macklemore and Miley Cyrus and avoid getting our struggle and plight caught up in mainstream award shows, which are really about profit and have no real interest in supporting queer people. I am no longer satiated by the incredibly limited media representation that both LGBTQ people and people of color receive and are expected to celebrate. There are queer recording artists of color out there who deserve recognition for their contribution to equality through their music, message, and visual art. It's time to give them our support."

Spears called into Chicago's 103.5 KISS FM on Friday for a quick-hit interview in which she discussed her Vegas stint, which was called into question a few weeks ago when reports indicated the 32-year-old singer was already planning to lip-sync during the shows. ""I'm definitely going to be singing live,"" Spears said. ""I always sing live. It doesn't sound so great all the time, but I do my best."" The initial report regarding Spears' supposed Vegas lip-syncing, first published by the New York Daily News, had some labeling it erroneous almost immediately. Either way, Spears' alleged onstage lip-syncing has been a hot topic throughout much of her career. “Britney does not sing,"" a source reportedly told the newspaper. ""She is being paid a lot of money to lip-sync. Her fans are none the wiser. ... She hasn’t sung live for a couple of years.”Spears' manager, Larry Rudolph, expressed the same to Billboard shortly after the rumors swirled. Rudolph said Spears will sing live but explained that most artists use a vocal backing track during performances. ""She does choreography and vocal coaching every day,"" he said.Still, Spears made it clear it'll take a tremendous amount of preparation to pull off the 90-minute ""Piece of Me"" Vegas shows, which open Dec. 27. She said she'll spend three to four weeks rehearsing at home and the same amount rehearsing in Vegas -- hopefully ample time to perfect the ""water, snow and rain"" that will be used during performances. During the interview, Spears also discussed recent reports saying she felt her sexuality had been pushed too far in the recent stages of her career. Specifically referencing the ""Work Bitch"" video, Spears said there was only one particularly ""risque shot"" that prompted her to tame the video. Head over to 103.5 KISS FM to listen to Spears' full interview."

In this excerpt, he asks Doc about his eventful NBA Draft night feud with Grantland czar, Celtics superfan, and Clippers season ticket holder Bill Simmons. On draft night, Rivers called Simmons an idiot for his claims that Rivers quit on the Celtics. That led to quite the back and forth throughout the evening and even into the next day in one of the more entertaining media feuds of the year.Alas, it doesn't appear that feud will carry on into the coming season with Simmons derisively chanting ""RI-VERS, RI-VERS, RI-VERS"" at Staples Center until he gets to coach the Clippers himself. Rivers tells Davis that while his kids had fun with the feud, the two have talked and appeared to have buried the hatchet.Well that's no fun. Hmpf.While Rivers is smiles and laughs about his draft night beef with Bill Simmons being settled it'll still be very interesting to see what happens this year if the Clippers struggle. If that's the case and Simmons again criticizes the usually media-friendly head coach, we could see this feud flare up once more. We'll know it's serious if Simmons calls Rivers ""Glenn"" again."

Send us your story here. I’ve been taking ballet all my life since I was very young, and while I did spend time during high school as part of a company, it has mostly been a lifelong hobby. As an undergraduate [at Howard University], at Harvard Business School, and as I moved to different cities -- Denver, Boston, Detroit, New York -- I'd always find a ballet studio. It just brings me so much joy to dance. To me, a sacred space should really be where you can practice something that brings you pure joy. And something that helps you celebrate what it is to be human. In this case, ballet is all about the human body and what you can do with the human body in a graceful way.Something about having the barre, the wooden floor, the pianist, the instructor, made me feel as though all else was outside. It became this sacred space. And though it was a place that was all my own -- where I could challenge and test myself -- it was also a collaboration with others, because truly you dance together, not by yourself. Everyone who is there has opted in simply because they love ballet and they enjoy dancing. So there's something about being with the like-minded women (and some men!) who are there with me. The truth is, that during class, I never looked at my phone. But one time I did and it became a reminder for how sacred the space should really be. My boss emailed me, during the break, between the barre and the floor exercise and I had just decided to check my email. Email draws you in and there’s always some action item -- something that triggers a response. For the rest of the class, it made it much more difficult to concentrate. Remembering the exercise, going across the floor. That one email check pulled into class what I should be doing after class. I lost being in the moment, being present and the joy faded. I realized that I had invaded my sacred space with technology. And though I didn't typically look at my phone, once I set up the rule that I would not look at my phone for those 90 minutes, it became a new form of self-discipline and a gift to myself of 90 minutes in which everything else can wait.

The idea of swinging by or driving through a McDonald's or a Wendy's is all about convenience and cost effectiveness. Today, however, with the growing demands for fast-food outlets to shape up and offer healthy options on their ever-expanding menus, prices have been rising. And from the Fiesta Taco Salad at Taco Bell to the Big Philly Cheesesteak at Subway, some fast-food menu items are a bit pricier than you might expect. And with fast-food workers rising up across the country to demand higher pay, we thought we'd take a look at just how much time would need to be logged by them in order to afford the most expensive items on their respective menus. Photo Credit: © Flickr /mhaithacaThe Most Expensive Fast-Food Menu ItemsDollar menus and value menus still exist throughout the U.S. for most large-scale fast-food brands. But if you're looking for a sizable salad or a hearty burger with all the fixings that might resemble something you'd get in a sit-down restaurant, you can expect to pay up. Haris Bacic, founder of Fastfoodmenuprices.com, told The Daily Meal that the rise of health-conscious consumers has in turn made fast-food restaurants step up their game to add healthier meals to their menus, including items such as grilled chicken sandwiches, grilled chicken wraps, and the like. ""Those are the items that are usually the most expensive, which makes sense,"" said Bacic. ""As the quality of food increases, so do the prices. This applies to the fast-casual restaurants such as Panera Bread as well, which are drastically more expensive than the average fast-food restaurant due to quality and freshness of the food served.""15 Celebrities Fast Food FavoritesOther items, like super-sized burgers and sandwiches, tend to be on the upper end of the price spectrum. At Subway, their most expensive menu item is the foot-long Big Philly Cheesesteak, similar to its sub shop competitor Jimmy John's, which has a sandwich called the J.J. Gargantuan. This beauty is 8 inches long and clocks in just less than $8. With the federal minimum wage currently holding steady at $7.25, that means that a worker there would need to work for more than an hour to afford it. At Wendy's, their Baconator sandwich is the priciest, while a variety of their signature salads come in a close second. Steak 'n Shake has a similar situation; their Southwest Chicken Salad and Apple Pecan Salad tie for the priciest menu items along with their California steak burger. On the international front, fast-food prices are soaring even higher, particularly in Japan . McDonald's has recently rolled out two of the most expensive burgers the chain has ever had on their menus.

Don't let the indian summer fool you. October is here which means cool weather is around the corner and you need to be prepared! I'm not talking down coats and knit hats... Boring. I'm talking hydrated skin, super smoky eyes and statement lips. Obviously. Summer may have been all about carefree skincare and ""no makeup looks"" but it's time you packed away your summer beauty regimen with your flip-flops and flower headbands. Fall and winter brings cold weather and indoor heaters blaring dry, dehydrating air on your precious skin. No bueno. First line of attack: Invest in a good humidifier and use it every night. Second line of attack: Check out the first half of the slideshow below for some skin-saving products.Now... it's not all doom and gloom. The fun part of fall and winter is the makeup! During the summer, you may have felt like rocking a smoky eye with a sundress was a little much and an oxblood statement lip was a bit too goth for a BBQ. Once the weather gets cooler, anything goes! I'm not saying go full out Bad Halloween but experiment with color and textures and check out the second half of the slideshow to find out the right products to help you get the right looks."

Here's a simple and colorful living room decorating idea -- keep your essential pieces neutral, and customize your lighting and décor for the seasons.These three living rooms began with the same basic elements -- a neutral traditional sofa, an iron and glass coffee table and a beige wall. With the addition of colorful artwork and accessories, each was transformed into a colorful space with a unique feel. Here's a closer look at how using color gave this one room three distinctly different looks:Warm Up for Fall with Red: Warm hues immediately conjure up images of fall - think crisp leaves, pumpkins and rosy cheeks. A bold red table lamp creates a focal point on the otherwise unnoticed end table, while a patterned red and white rug adds interest on the floor. Note that many of the red décor accents also feature white, to lighten them up visually and keep them from overpowering the neutral living room. Cool Down for Winter with Blue: Cool shades of aqua, dazzling blue and navy are a sophisticated way to transition into the winter season -- and they look beautiful paired with silver or gold for holiday decorating. The blue patterned area rug anchors the look and gives the blue lighting and accessories context in the space.Perk Up for Spring with Purple: Purple (with a hint of contrasting yellow as an accent) is a fresh take on spring decorating. While not for the faint of heart, it can be very livable when introduced in soft shades like lilac and lavender. Look for colorful home décor to brighten up your living room as the weather warms up again.For more living room decorating ideas to give your space a fresh look, take a look at these two videos on side table trends and decorating the coffee table."
