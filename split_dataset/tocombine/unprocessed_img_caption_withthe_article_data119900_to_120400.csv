Three days after her Navy husband, Landon, was killed overseas, Theresa, who had a newborn baby, co-wrote a column with me about her experience. It was a fresh, raw glimpse at what being a new military widow with young children really looks like. ""To hear your screams of 'I want him alive! I want him alive!' was almost more than I could bear,"" Theresa wrote then about telling her son, Anthony, that his father was dead. It was always amazing to me that Theresa was able to write with such clarity so soon after losing her husband. Of course, in many ways, her biggest struggles as a new, widowed mother were yet to come.Landon is now buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Theresa's ""newborn"" is crawling, and Anthony is 7 years old. The funeral flowers are gone, and the rest of the world has seemingly ""moved on."" That's why, on this Memorial Day, it's important to remember that Theresa is still here, still grieving.I asked Theresa to write again with updates about these first months without Landon. What follows are her words:""Eight months have passed since my husband was killed in the Red Sea. Landon was not killed by enemy fire, nor as a result of a mechanical failure. He was killed as he sat in his helicopter, rotors spinning and chained to the deck of a ship that was going too fast in high seas. A large wall of water hit the side of ship, shot up, and crashed onto the helicopter, causing it to break apart and eventually go over the side with both pilots still strapped in their seats.Photo courtesy of Dustin Smiley, who served with Landon and visited his grave at Arlington National Cemetery.This column originally appeared as part of Navy wife Sarah Smiley's syndicated newspaper column. www.SarahSmiley.com "
2,RELIGION,Why Do So Few Americans Actually Observe Memorial Day?,Jaweed Kaleem,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/memorial-day-2014-observations_n_5389556.html,,2014-05-26,"ARLINGTON, VA - MAY 25: Mike Sunderhaus of Belair, Maryland, becomes emotional as he visits the grave site of his friend, U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal Jeremiah E. Savage who was killed in 2004 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, at Arlington National Cemetery May 25, 2014 in Arlington, Virginia. Americans across the nation observe the Memorial Day this weekend to remember the men and women who died while serving in the U.S. military. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e76d200000c7010185a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For three decades now on the last Monday of May, Bill Brater has gathered in the chapel of the funeral home he manages in Statesville, North Carolina, for what he considers one of the most important ceremonies of the year.Joining a crowd of about 250 residents ranging from politicians to schoolteachers, Brater has watched as military veterans post the colors of the American flag and people offer songs (""God Bless America"" is a popular choice) and prayers (a pastor will recite John 8:31-32 this year) for those who have died while on duty. Afterwards, the group spreads across cemeteries for wreath-laying ceremonies on veterans' graves.It's the kind of event seen in small towns and big cities across the U.S., with some accompanied by patriotic parades, every Memorial Day since the holiday's first observations after the Civil War. But Brater, whose father fought in the Korean War and whose son served as a Navy Seal, has noticed a growing pattern over the years. ""It's tending to skew toward the senior side for people who show up. There aren't many in their 20s and only a few in their 30s,"" said the 59-year-old, who has taken to putting ads in the Statesville Record & Landmark newspaper to entice people to come to the ceremony that once spread by word-of-mouth. ""It's just sad, I'm not sure how many people care or understand.""As the federal government pauses on Monday in recognition of the only American holiday dedicated to the memory of those who died while on duty, offering dramatic graveside ceremonies and moments of silence, much of the country will simply carry on as usual. According to recent surveys, less than 5 percent of Americans plan to attend a parade, be part of a memorial service or visit gravesites on what was originally called Decoration Day for its tradition of putting flowers on graves.President Barack Obama will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, but many Americans can't recall what Memorial Day is exactly about.In a 2000 Gallup poll that asked Americans to define the holiday, the most recent survey on the topic, only 28 percent of people correctly said it was about remembering those who died while serving in the military. In many areas, Memorial Day may be better known for its sales and spikes in DUIs.""For a lot of people, it's just a day of fun, a day off. Maybe they go to the beach or on vacation,"" said Brater, who dutifully spent each Memorial Day while growing up in Cincinnati at the cemetery with his parents. ""Things change.""It wasn't always that way.After the end of the Civil War in 1865, an estimated 700,000 Americans were left dead, with thousands of unidentified bodies and unmarked graves. One of the first recorded remembrances for those soldiers was in Charleston, South Carolina. There, liberated slaves converted a horse race track-turned-prison for Union soldiers into a burial ground and led a parade of 10,000 on the track to ""make sense of the death and destruction and what would come next,"" said David Blight, a professor of American history at Yale University. ""There were massive spiritual and logistical challenges to dealing with death, and nobody had dealt with it on that scale before. It was all about coping,"" said Blight, author of Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory. ""In the South they declared memorial days on different days, though eventually it crystallized on the last Monday of May, largely due to the availability of flowers for graves. The first official Decoration Day, observed across the country, was May 30, 1868.""Community groups, from veterans organizations to women's clubs and churches, led commemorations. ""In the early days, especially among Catholics, it was often called the American All Saints Day because it was about honoring our dead ancestors who we revered,"" said Blight.Today, the practice of going to a parade or decorating graves isn't nearly as popular. That decline is part of a pattern in American history of how Americans react to war and death, Blight said.""Memorial Day was big throughout the late 19th century and began to wane in the early 20th century, but then there was a huge revival during World World I. That has been the story throughout. Commemorative practices, especially at grave sites, really revive at war time. It even happened during the Gulf War and the peak of the Iraq War.""In 2011, the Pew Research Center reported that while more than 77 percent of adults 50 and older said they had a relative who had been in the military, the number fell drastically for younger age groups, with just 33 percent of Americans under 29 saying they had a family member in the military. Twenty years earlier, a Gallup poll found 60 percent of Americans had either served in World War II or the Korean or Vietnam Wars, or had immediate family who did.Despite inside-the-beltway arguments over the need to expand or decrease the size of the military, no one would argue it's bad that fewer people have to deal with the violence of war, said Kim Ruocco, who works for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, an Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit that supports families of military servicemen and women who have died.But Ruocco, whose husband, John, served in Iraq as a Marine and died by suicide in 2005, is more conflicted about how Americans remember the dead.""On one hand I think, 'What are people remembering if not those who served?,"" said Ruocco, a social worker who runs suicide outreach and education programs and will spend Memorial Day with her 18- and 20-year-old sons at a ""good grief camp"" her organization hosts annually in Washington, D.C. ""But then I think, people who served are proud to take that responsibility, that anxiety off the shoulders of their fellow citizens so those citizens can do things like go to the beach and have picnics on Memorial Day. They serve and protect so we don't have to always worry and think about it.""Brater, the funeral home manager in North Carolina, said his goal is not only to get people to think about those who died, but also to educate his community.""Knowledge of the past is invaluable to youth today,"" he said this week while planning for Monday's 45-minute affair. To that effect, he invited a Tom Corbell, a Lutheran minister, to speak this year. While the pastor will offer short prayers, his message will largely be a study of history. He'll describe those -- famous and unknown -- who died in American wars and their stories of triumph and tragedy, before ending on a quote from President Dwight D. Eisenhower:""May the light of freedom, coming to all darkened lands, flame brightly until at last the darkness is no more. May the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace, when men and nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each, the brotherhood of all."""
3,IMPACT,"""We Are Not Job-Seekers, We Are Job-Creators""-- Turning Unemployment into Entrepreneurship","Muhammad Yunus, ContributorNobel Peace Prize winner; founder, Grameen Bank; Chairman, Yun...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/we-are-not-job-seekers-we_b_5392136.html,"Replicating the social business equity investments with unemployed youth around the world can help solve the age-old problem of unemployment, not just in the poor countries but in any country and can turn job-seekers into job creators.",2014-05-26,"Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize winner and microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus delivers a speech during the 4th edition of the Global Social Business Summit, held at the Austria Center, in Vienna, on November 8, 2012. 'This summit is a kind of breath of fresh air. All the gloom and doom in the world, we want to get out of that,' Yunus, 72, said at the three-day event in Vienna. AFP PHOTO / ALEXANDER KLEIN (Photo credit should read ALEXANDER KLEIN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c3a83c000018010bea78.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since I launched the idea of microcredit in 1976, I have created many other businesses to help poor people help themselves. These experiences were summed up in the concept of social business, problem-solving companies without taking personal dividends beyond the investment money -- a new form of capitalism designed to solve social problem around the world. Application of social business concept in overcoming unemployment can produce a sustainable solution.In Bangladesh we are addressing the problem of unemployment among the second generation of Grameen Bank borrowers. We are trying to turn the unemployed into entrepreneurs through equity investment from social business funds created for this purpose. In Bangla we call them NobinUdyokta -- i.e. New Entrepreneurs.The need for the New Entrepreneurs initiative grew out of the frustration of millions of young people, including the educated youth from Grameen families, who'd completed their college training through education loans from Grameen Bank -- but were unable to find jobs. We tried giving them loans to set up businesses. It did not take off.A new approach was clearly needed. We moved away from loan to equity. We redesigned it in the form of equity financing from social business funds. We created these funds and developed a methodology to do it in large numbers, and in a sustainable and replicable way. We created a platform where New Entrepreneurs could present their business ideas to potential investors (the funds). Yunus Centre launched a platform called Design Lab in January, 2013 to bring the New Entrepreneurs and the funds face to face. Encouraged by its success, we decided to hold the lab every month. During the last 15 months we have held 14 such labs.The New Entrepreneurs initiative offers an innovative, replicable model for tackling the problem of youth unemployment that promises to be more direct and effective than traditional approaches. Rather than creating jobs as the uncertain by-product of a corporate project or a government program, it helps young people create their own jobs by launching businesses with equity funding from investors. The investors are also providing additional support in form of advice, training, and guidance.In a social business (as explained in my books Creating a World Without Poverty and Building Social Business), the investor owns the company, but he doesn't claim profits produced by the company as in traditional capitalism. Instead, he receives dividend payments from company revenues until the total received equals the amount originally invested. Then he can sell the shares at the market value. But since this is his social business he cannot, and does not wish to, take more than face value. Any additional value that he receives he has to invest in another social business. In the New Entrepreneurs initiative we simplified this sale of shares. The fund sells the shares to the New Entrepreneurs at face value and charges an additional fixed fee of 20 percent on top of that. We call this additional amount the share transfer fee; it serves to recompense the fund for taking on the risk of the business as well as for the support services it provided. None of this fee goes to any individual as a personal profit.Next phase of our work is to deepen and expand the New Entrepreneur initiative by creating Social Business Villages. Each Social Business Village will be an autonomous, economically viable entity based on the lowest local government unit in Bangladesh, a cluster of about 20 villages known as a union. Each Social Business Village will have a Social Business Fund. This fund will receive money from individuals, corporations, foundations, and government. Purpose of the fund will be to provide equity to the unemployed, including New Entrepreneurs, and invest in all types of social businesses. Ultimate objective would be to create a village which will be free from unemployment and social problems.Replicating the social business equity investments with unemployed youth around the world can help solve the age-old problem of unemployment, not just in the poor countries but in any country and can turn job-seekers into job creators. Entrepreneurship allows everyone to be an active citizen, saving people from state dependency or reliance on charity."

Police said an employee of the restaurant was ""slashed during the fight"" but refused treatment, per the news site. Mayweather told celebrity news site NecoleBitchie.com that the fight had been sparked by a misunderstanding over an Instagram photo posted a few weeks ago by T.I.'s wife, Tameka ""Tiny"" Harris. The photograph, which featured Mayweather posing with Harris and several other women, had apparently rubbed T.I. the wrong way, the boxer said. “I been knowing Tiny before T.I.,” Mayweather told the site. “I’ve never slept with her, I never kissed her, never touched her in no inappropriate way.""In one video of the brawl, Mayweather can be heard yelling at T.I. to ""control your bitch.""

Egyptians begin voting in a new presidential election which ex-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who ousted the elected Islamist leader, is expected to easily win amid calls for stability and economic recovery. AFP PHOTO/MAHMOUD KHALED (Photo credit should read MAHMOUD KHALED/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc136e32600005300708fe4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CAIRO -- A sense of celebration permeated the scene outside many polling stations here on Monday. People lining up to cast ballots for yet another president chanted and sang songs in support of former military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, as military helicopters hovered low in the sky and heavily-armed masked soldiers guarded the lines.El-Sissi, who has been leading the country since ousting democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi last July, is expected to win the two-day elections in a landslide. But many people here are boycotting the election entirely or expressing deep apathy for a vote they say is all too predictable. In addition to fierce Morsi supporters, many secular Egyptians also say they’ve lost faith in the ballot box.""I just don’t see why I should bother,"" said Dalia Shoukry, a 29-year-old who protested during the 2011 revolution to topple longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. ""[The state is] puppeteering everything and making it seem like it’s a democracy. Everyone is believing it.""While Shoukry is no supporter of Morsi -- she is quick to slam his rule as entirely ineffective -- she said she has no tolerance for el-Sissi, who many say will become the country's next dictator. It’s exactly the kind of leadership she demonstrated against in Tahrir Square more than three years ago.Shoukry’s husband, a 31-year-old doctor named Mohamed Wahhaby, said that most of his friends are choosing not to vote. ""We need a whole restructuring of the government hierarchy,"" he said. ""El-Sissi got handed the country on a silver platter.""Since Morsi's ousting last summer, tens of thousands of people -- including journalists, academics and high-powered revolutionary activists -- have been sent to jail and thousands have been killed. The very act of protesting is now illegal without a permit from the government. But el-Sissi's large support base says that a strict rule of law is exactly what Egypt needs to fix the crumbling economy and energy crisis and curb the near-daily attacks on security buildings and personnel.El-Sissi did not appear at any of his official rallies leading up to the election. But posters and banners bearing his face are plastered all over the capital city. El-Sissi mugs, hats, pins, flags and chocolates are sold everywhere, whereas paraphernalia for his leftist opponent, Hamdeen Sabahi, is few and far between.Still, many feel the country is just backtracking to the type of leadership that helped spark the Arab Spring. Activist Ahmad Badawy, who works at the Egyptian Democratic Academy, a Cairo-based NGO, said el-Sissi resembles nothing short of a fascist ruler. When Egyptians went to the polls in January in a constitutional referendum supported by the military-backed government, Badawy was arrested and beaten for passing out fliers urging Egyptians to vote 'no.' He said he has no interest in voting this week. ""I don’t see any elections; I only see the crowning of a new dictator,"" he said. Even if he wanted to vote, he added, his Egyptian ID was taken during his detainment and he hasn’t been able to get a new one yet.Egypt’s media has largely taken a nationalistic tone in portraying el-Sissi as Egypt’s savior. Newspaper columns have poeticized his masculinity and television stations have branded election boycotters as traitors. ""He’s a father figure, a savior, a knight in shining armor,"" a woman named Sara, who works in the development sector, remarked sarcastically. She agreed to speak about her decision to boycott the election, but declined to give her last name out of fear for her security. ""El-Sissi doesn’t need to explain his position on issues. People worship him. It’s not going to make a difference if I vote.""Instead, Sara said she is putting her energy toward making a difference after the election, getting involved with grassroots campaigns to try to change the country's long-entrenched oppression.People should not be ""focused on a magic bullet or just one person who will make everything better,"" she said. ""There is a need for security, but that is precisely the problem with the last 30 or more years. There was always this prioritization over people’s rights. We haven’t learned that lesson yet."""

Pro-business leader has already signaled his bold intentions by slashing his cabinet and inviting leaders from across South Asia to the inauguration at the presidents palace including the prime minister of arch-rival Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif.(Photo By Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc136e4240000350022870d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Shyamantha AsokanNEW DELHI, May 26 (Reuters) - Narendra Modi was sworn in as India's prime minister in an elaborate ceremony at New Delhi's resplendent presidential palace on Monday, after a sweeping election victory that ended two terms of rule by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.Millions of Indians watched the inauguration live on television as the 63-year-old Hindu nationalist leader, once thought of as too divisive to lead the world's largest democracy, took his oath along with his cabinet members in the palace's forecourt.The low-caste son of a tea stall-owner, Modi has given India its first parliamentary majority after 25 years of coalition governments, which means he has ample room to advance reforms that started over two decades ago but have stalled in recent years.Many supporters see him as India's answer to the neo-liberal former U.S. President Ronald Reagan or British leader Margaret Thatcher. One foreign editor has ventured Modi could be so transformative he turns out to be ""India's Deng Xiaoping"", the leader who set China on its path of spectacular economic growth. ""A GLORIOUS FUTURE""Modi invited leaders from across South Asia to his swearing-in ceremony, including Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from arch-rival Pakistan, an unprecedented gesture that was as much a show of his determination to be a key player on the global stage as a celebration of his stunning election victory.Even before his inauguration, Modi made waves on the global stage, where once he was treated by many with suspicion - and by some as a pariah - for Hindu-Muslim violence that erupted 12 years ago in Gujarat, the western state he ruled.He has spoken with the presidents of the United States and Russia, and he has become one of only three people that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe follows on Twitter. The U.S. administration denied Modi a visa in 2005, but President Barack Obama has now invited him to the White House.In a message released to fellow Indians and citizens of the world, Modi said the election had delivered a mandate for ""development, good governance and stability"".""Together we will script a glorious future for India. Let us together dream of a strong, developed and inclusive India that actively engages with the global community to strengthen the cause of world peace and development,"" he said.The pomp and ceremony unfolded as the summer evening closed in at Rashtrapati Bhavan, a colonial-era sandstone mansion with 340 rooms in the heart of New Delhi. Looking on were some 4,000 guests, ranging from members of the defeated Nehru-Gandhi family to top industrialists, Bollywood actors, Hindu holy men and the leaders of several neighboring countries.Modi supporters exploded fireworks in celebration a few blocks away at the headquarters of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the new prime minister was sworn in.The BJP and its allies swept elections this month, ousting the Nehru-Gandhi's Congress party in a seismic political shift that has given his party a mandate for sweeping economic reform.Modi kicked things off on Sunday with an announcement that he would streamline the cabinet, a move to a more centralized system of governing aimed at breaking decision-making bottlenecks widely blamed for dragging down economic growth.Modi said he would appoint super ministers in charge of several departments to make ministries coordinate better.Arun Jaitley, 61, is the front runner to be named finance minister, party sources said. One of the top corporate lawyers in the country and a close Modi aide, Jaitley served in a previous BJP administration as commerce minister. DIPLOMATIC GESTUREPakistan's Sharif said after arriving in Delhi that South Asia's bitterest rivals now have an opportunity to turn a page in their history of troubled relations.He said the nuclear-armed neighbors, which were traumatically separated at the end of British rule in 1947 and have fought three wars since, should together rid their region of the instability that has plagued them for decades.""We should remove fears, mistrust and misgivings about each other,"" he told the Indian news network NDTV.The BJP has long advocated a tough stance on Pakistan, with which India has a major territorial dispute in Kashmir, and Modi has been seen as a hardliner on issues of national security.In that respect, Modi's decision to invite Sharif for his inauguration and bilateral talks on Tuesday came as a surprise and raised hopes for a thaw in relations between the rivals, which have been particularly frosty since 2008 attacks on the city of Mumbai by Pakistan-based militants.Vikram Sood, former head of India's external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, told Reuters that inviting all the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was ""an astute"" diplomatic gesture.""This augurs well for the region, and an improvement of relations all over the region is possible if these moves are followed by other steps, bilaterally and multilaterally,"" he said.As a gesture of goodwill following their invitations, Pakistan and Sri Lanka released hundreds of Indian fishermen jailed for straying into their neighbors' territorial waters.India is the biggest South Asian nation, but friendships with neighbors have soured in recent years, allowing China to fill the gap.China has built a port in Sri Lanka and is involved in upgrading another in Bangladesh, besides military and civil assistance to long-time ally Pakistan, heightening Delhi's anxieties of being boxed in.""Modi has appreciated the much-neglected fact that foreign policy begins at the nation's borders,"" wrote foreign policy analyst C. Raja Mohan in the Indian Express. ""As a realist, however, Modi should be aware that major breakthroughs are unlikely amid the current flux within Pakistan.""

According leaders here, the next two decades will bring a period of chaos and conflict -- manageable, they hope, without war -- after which China will be in charge, by default if not by grand design. It's not in China's DNA to want to run the world, but the country's ravenous need for resources, labor and markets may draw it in that direction.But in between here and there -- if there is going to be a there -- China faces an array of challenges and risks. Since nine is the imperial number, it's appropriate for a list of them:HUBRISThe Chinese leadership class is forever telling Americans that they need to be “humble,” and, given the faults of our system and our society, to stop lecturing other countries about morality, democracy and human rights. But as China grows in economic might -- and political clout -- the attitude has gained a bit of an aggressive edge. On a weeklong reporting trip, I was struck by the legacy of anger that remains for some about China's last ""two bad centuries,"" and a sense of righting old wrongs and climbing to the top of not just the Asian global mountain that still pervades. The risk here is fear -- and collective opposition -- worldwide.TRASH TALKING AMERICADespite a claim to a history so long it gives them a unique calm and patience on the world stage, China's leaders today are responding tit-for-tat in an escalating war of words with the U.S. over everything from trade to naval exercises to industrial espionage. The U.S. may be as guilty as China when it comes to playing hardball on all counts, but the aggressive sense of grievance on conspicuous display in Beijing feels like overkill. Leaders mentioned things like President Barack Obama's visit with the Japanese emperor, U.S. support for the Dalai Lama, and what they insist are unfounded charges of cyber espionage. The Chinese boast that they know much more about America than we do about China, but that really isn't saying much. And if China is headed to hegemony, its educated leaders need to calm down.  INFLAMING THE NEIGHBORSThe challenge closer at hand for China is to continue investing in and trading with the rest of Asia, without creating resentment and violent backlash. Riots recently exploded in Vietnam over a Chinese oil-drilling rig in the South China Sea, and the Chinese are resented and feared in places like Cambodia -- even though China feels it's doing the locals there a favor with its participation in the economy. As for Japan, the Chinese government is licensing -- and promoting -- a sweeping domestic propaganda campaign that taps into deep-seated hatred of the Japanese. The risk: a hot naval war with Japan that could involve the U.S.POLLUTIONThe foul, dangerous and impenetrable air that usually hangs over Beijing, Shanghai and other cities isn’t just an environmental and medical threat, it is also a political one. Populist resentment of all kinds is real and growing in China, and some of it is caused by and aimed at environmental privilege. In Beijing, talk is rife of well-connected officials and business big shots who manage to get their kids into schools with domed outdoor playing fields. The better-paid managers get to work in offices and buildings with special air purification systems. Not everyone can afford it, and those who can't could someday do what the Politburo most fears: become a public protest crowd, and head for Tiananmen Square.CORRUPTION AND INCOME INEQUALITYTechnocrats here dismiss the notion that China is vulnerable to Thomas Piketty-type attacks, on the theory that even though the income gap is growing, income growth at the bottom is rising (just not as quickly). That may be true, but perceptions matter, especially in a society obsessed with social rank. That's why President Xi Jinping began his term with a loud and effective attack on the most visible signs of official corruption -- things like lavish, expense account-enabled ""gifting exchanges"" (I’ll give you a Rolex if you give me a Piaget”), meals at French restaurants and lavish lakeside private parties. There have been warnings to cool it -- even to Xi's family. But having launched his crusade, he can't stop now. The deeper he goes, the more entrenched interests and resentful foes he attacks.ECONOMY 2.0China's planners are confident, with good reason, that even if the nation doesn’t grow at double-digit rates, it will maintain its steady upward path by turning to a service economy enabled by ITC, e-commence and social media. They are probably right, but they are also dealing with a revolution of rising expectations: The “90s generation,” iPhones wired to their ears, expect more -- maybe more than the country can provide. And China still needs physical resources and cheap labor, both of which are becoming scarcer. China will be moving increasingly out into the world to fulfill the needs of further growth. The world will want the business; China, which recently bought the United States' largest pork producer, is literally eating our lunch. But when does serious resentment and fear set in? The answer: In the United States, it already has.UIGHURS AND TERRORISMFor the first time in recent memory, locals say, members of the People's Liberation Army showed up on prominent street corners in Shanghai last week, with rifles at the ready as they surveyed the crowds. The reason, apparently, was concern over terrorists far to the west in the autonomous Xinjiang region, where attackers in the capital of Urumqi killed 31 and injured more than 90 when they drove through a busy market while throwing explosives. The government has launched a huge ""crackdown"" in the wake of the attack, and it seems to have the backing of the average citizens. The measures are expected to be harsh. But with the response comes a risk: China could turn into something it so far has avoided becoming -- a serious Al Qaeda target.DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMSProudly (though somewhat defensively at times), Chinese intellectuals and officials alike say that American-style democracy is neither a personal right nor a system that would work in China. Indeed, they insist that their top-down system of unelected Socialist control overseeing a thriving market economy is showing itself to be superior when it comes to producing on-the-ground results. But at the same time, these people counsel patience, saying that in a decade or two China will be much freer, more open and more democratic. In other words, critics have a point. China's never going to be a Jeffersonian society, but the skyrocketing growth of the Internet has created a new generation that is used to being able to find information -- real information -- anywhere and at any time. Can the country's leadership balance a Confucianism ""know thy place"" ethos with the ""anything goes"" mentality of net-baed consumerism and expanded political expression? It's not clear.IDENTITY CRISISFor thousands of years, China has been content to define itself with its written language, its court-based Confucianism, and an inward-looking faith that the Middle Kingdom was the only world the Chinese needed to know. They felt no need to explain themselves to anyone -- even, often, themselves. China just WAS, and it was beyond the ken of leaders and people there that others didn't see its superiority. Today, China can no longer take that attitude. It needs to explain itself to the world if it is to play the global leadership role that may be its destiny. But to do that, the Chinese have to decide who they are in the 21st century. What is their message to and for the planet, other than the clear virtue of an engine of material progress that has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty? Speaking from its heart to the world has never been China's strength, but it must now, for the sake of everyone Under Heaven."
