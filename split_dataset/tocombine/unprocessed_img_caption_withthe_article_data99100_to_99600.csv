Nine CBC members made a trip to Wellspring United Methodist Church on Sunday, just miles away from where protests erupted following the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August. The leading black lawmakers emphasized that the purpose of their visit was to stand in solidarity with members of the community rooting for reform. Church members took to the pulpit during the service to share their grief over Brown’s death and remind residents that the tragedy will not be forgotten. The legislators largely expressed support for Ferguson protesters. “We’re not just going to sweep this under the rug because it looks bad or because it makes some of us uncomfortable,” Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) said. “All of us should feel uncomfortable. We should be upset; I know I am.”“We are here to demonstrate to the demonstrators that we have their back in our role as their federal representatives,” Clay said. Rep. G. K. Butterfield (D- N.C.), the chairman of CBC, also addressed the parishioners to express solidarity with the activists' efforts for racial justice, noting that all demonstrators are working toward the same goals.“Any division is exaggerated. In any movement there’s always a different perspective between different groups of people, but what you’re hearing about the divide is greatly exaggerated,” Butterfield said.Chiming in to further explain the purpose of CBC’s trip was Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.), who is also the second Muslim to ever be elected to Congress:“We’ve met with several groups of activists, and what we have found is that they are excited about participating in the political process,” Carson said. “They just need some direction.""While a vast majority of community residents and protesters embraced the trip from CBC members, some felt slightly indifferent.Kelly Stephens, a 33-year-old bartender in St. Louis who has actively participated in the protests, said that while she appreciated the CBC visit, she didn't think it would change things. “It’s a huge step for the country, but St. Louis is so deep-seated, I’m not sure that anything will change. I fear it will only get worse.” CBC members also offered up some ideas for broader reform during the trip, including proposing independent investigations into police killings by delegating a special commission to review them.“We have heard from people around the country say there should be a national crime commission,” Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said. “That is something we hope to place before our colleagues.”  Ashley Yates, the co-founder of Millennial Activists United, a grassroots organization focused on social justice and racial equality, said she thought the CBC's trip to Ferguson was in good faith, but that she wanted more action from the lawmakers.Yates said her frustrations with the CBC stem from some of the members’ decisions to vote down legislation last year that would have stopped the 1033 program, which funnels excess military equipment to local police forces.“It’s like the song we sing -- 'Which Side Are You On?'"" Now you see people gravitating towards their sides of history. People like the CBC signed off on the 1033 after the events in Ferguson. Now you see them trying to plug into Ferguson,” Yates said. “We are still protesting in the spirit of the civil rights movement,"" she said. ""We are reclaiming Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and how our blackness is portrayed, so they don’t sanitize his legacy. There’s still important conversations that need to be made and work to be done.” Despite the concerns, Butterfield spoke on behalf of the CBC and vowed that the group will focus on criminal justice reform: “We promise Ferguson and we promise America that the issue of criminal justice reform is the centerpiece of the CBC agenda in the 114th Congress,” he said.

(Photo by Gene Kappock/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f884240000310098aea8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When two deranged gunmen can kill a dozen journalists and send Paris into panic in the name of their prophet, we seem to have more evidence of the damage religion does in the world today. We watch as the so-called ""Islamic State"" combines social media with barbaric tactics to unleash inexplicable terror. We hear time and again of clergy abusing their power by abusing members of their flocks. We are drawn further into cynicism when even Buddhist monks find themselves in the headlines for promoting violence in South East Asia. Religion seems to poison everything. Every MLK Day, the Reverend Doctor's sage wisdom and booming voice seem like echoes of a past farther and farther away. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would have been 86 years old this week. Had he somehow escaped assassins' bullets, I can imagine him grey and dignified, bringing his prophetic wisdom to today's crises. More than ever, we could use his help to remember how to live together. Dr. King taught that faith can provide the glue that keeps people striving to be their own better angels, and that faith is a force for good in this world. He may have been ""an extremist for love,"" but he wasn't parochial about his faith, and he heard God's call in many sacred languages. He marched with Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who proclaimed that as they marched in Selma ""I felt my legs were praying."" He earned the respect and admiration of Catholic worker movement leader Dorothy Day. Muslim interfaith activist Eboo Patel often reminds his audiences of Dr. King's interfaith roots: Dr. King built on the non-violent work of a Hindu from colonial India, Mohandas ""Mahatma"" Gandhi (who himself was inspired by the Jain non-violent tradition, and the civil disobedience work of American Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau). We need to recall these powerful examples of disparate faiths converging as benevolent forces for remaking the world into a more peaceful, equal place. This year we saw the Nobel Committee split the Peace Prize between an interfaith duo that carries that torch forward. Malala Yousafzai defies the barks of Muslim puritans, and their bullets, to give voice to an Islam that stands for women's education. Her co-recipient and children's rights activist, Kailash Satyarthi, changed his last name to mean ""one who seeks truth,"" from the Hindu concept of Satya. When they accepted the prize together in Oslo they spoke from their respective faith traditions about society's responsibility to its children. Who are other faith leaders today that we can look to for moral direction? His Holiness the Dalai Lama may come to mind, as may His Holiness Pope Francis -- who can host dinners for the homeless while helping diplomatic efforts between Cuba and America. Evangelical Christian leaders like Rev. Samuel Rodriguez are working to bring dignity to the ""humanitarian crisis"" of American immigration reform. But we need not only rely on heroes from on high to provide role models for faith. We need to tell more stories, and more often, about people enacting their deeply held values. Towards this end, I think we should see the impact that regular people are making through their faith, and non-faith. For example, Chris Stedman is a humanist who serves as a chaplain at Yale University and seeks rapprochement between communities of faith and secular folks. My friend Dane Rowley, a Mormon admissions executive at Cal Lutheran University, lives out his faith through a noble and gentle kindness towards all people with whom he interacts. He is a voice for women's rights and fair treatment of all people in his congregation. Jacquie Kaur and her husband Ravi Singh found that the homeless in Los Angeles' Skid Row neighborhood outnumbered the resources that could be provided to them. So they mobilized their Sikh faith to take hot meals to the hungry in a taco truck, and the Khalsa Peace Corps was born. If we pay attention, we can see examples of faith bringing us together more than tearing us apart. And to me that is a major part of Dr. King's legacy of which we cannot lose sight or let go. Whatever our faith or guiding philosophy, we can act from deep within our value system to help bend that arc of history towards justice.Many remind us, and constantly, of the death toll under religions' banners. But so many of these conflicts have political and economic roots, something that religion writer Karen Armstrong argues in her recent book on ""religious"" violence called ""Fields of Blood."" And moreover, we can take our pick from faithless causes that have murdered millions whether in Stalin's Russia, Nazi Germany, or Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. What is the religion of unbridled capitalism that enslaves, maims and demoralizes the global poor? Faiths and philosophies can be used to buttress the beautiful in human history, or to undermine it. The banners waved matter less than the intentions in the hearts of those who wave them. Let's tell better stories of how people with worldviews like and unlike our own are trying to make a better world. Like Dr. King, let us find ways to make faith relevant to the needs of our time, and to use its light to forge through the dark caverns of hate and injustice. --Interfaith Expert Dr. Rahuldeep Singh Gill directs the Center for Equality and Justice (@CLU_CEJ) at California Lutheran University (@CalLutheran) where he is a professor in the Department of Religion."

Photo taken by Boris Spremo/Toronto Star Feb. 1, 1976. (Boris Spremo/Toronto Star via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc143c32300003300d0c64d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a U.S.-born Cuban and historian who has traveled to Cuba dozens of times since my career began nearly 18 years ago, there is one question that I am asked more than any other: What will happen in Cuba after Fidel Castro dies?In many ways, the question itself reveals how most people outside of Cuba understand the revolutionary government: whether they agree with the image or not, most Americans and Cubans in the United States (with the possible exception of recent immigrants) inadvertently validate the revolutionary government's own vision of itself as a monolithic state legitimately embodied in the heroic, charismatic figure of Fidel Castro. Just as Cuba's state-controlled media and officials have always wanted us to believe, Fidel is not only supposed to be the state but, by default, the Cuban people. As Che Guevara once wrote, one is the same as the other.By contrast, most island Cubans call the revolutionary government el sistema. Why they do might provide the best possible answer to the question of what will become of Cuba in the wake of Fidel's disappearance from the political scene and the legacies of his rule. Moreover, understanding the inner workings of el sistema serves to explain how Raúl Castro and Barack Obama's recent decision to renew diplomatic relations may not change Cuba in ways politically or economically beneficial to the majority of citizens.In order to predict the future of Cuba without Fidel, one first has to look back to understand what Cuba was like with Fidel. Today, few would deny the overwhelming popular euphoria that hailed the triumph of Fidel Castro's 26 of July Movement over the U.S.-backed Batista regime in 1959. Yet denials of his overwhelming support among the population for years after 1959 have become increasingly common in recent years, especially in Miami. While it is impossible, at one level, to measure support for Fidel and the Revolution in the absence of polling, a free press or the right to form organized opposition forces at the time, most exiles who left Cuba in the mid-to-late 1960s and early 1970s (the peak of immigration) testified that Fidel Castro's popularity never dramatically waned among a majority of Cubans over the course of the first 15-or-so years of the revolutionary state.Nonetheless, the difference between this historic, in-the-moment testimony and exiles' memory today is understandable. Contrary to what most outside observers, especially U.S. supporters of the Revolution, reported at the time, Cubans became much more equally poor than equally rich under communism in the 1960s and 70s, at least until the effects of Soviet planning and subsidies set in. While certainly many Cubans -- particularly landless peasants and underemployed workers -- benefited from state-funded housing and educational programs in the first years after 1959, most Cubans enjoyed better salaries but quickly found that they had little or nothing to buy. Undoubtedly, the U.S. embargo hit Cubans hard, but the misguided policies of Fidel's capricious economic planners, such as laws restricting the rights of small farmers to grow and market crops of their own choosing, hit them even harder.Still, despite the extraordinary geopolitical pressures, raging austerity and daily challenges involved with acquiring basic goods on the ration, the Communist Party and its attending apparatus of ""mass organizations"" -- such as Cuba's unique neighborhood-based citizen-surveillance groups known as Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, or CDRs -- grew stronger, not weaker.How did that happen? Arguably, the political power of the state grew in direct proportion to its control over people's material lives and the restricting of citizens' autonomy, that is, their ability to pursue a livelihood unconnected to leaders' demands for loyalty. To be precise, 1968 represents ground zero for the consolidation of el sistema in this regard. Overnight on March 13 of that year, the state nationalized all small businesses, banned private enterprise of any kind and initiated unprecedented mass mobilizations of unpaid, ""voluntary"" labor. In order to pass ideological muster, membership suddenly became mandatory in CDRs, the elementary school-based Pioneers for Communism, Federation of Cuban Women, state-run labor unions, etc.As Fidel Castro repeatedly explained, political education through these organizations, together with hard, free manual labor for the state, would strip citizens of their ""selflessness"" and ""greed,"" preparing them for the prosperous, egalitarian and materially developed paradise that was yet to come. Indeed, Cubans soon joked that Fidel Castro paid so much attention to Cuba's future in virtually every speech that if the future tense did not exist, Fidel would have gone mute. Of course, that paradise never came. Instead, by the mid 1970s, Cuba boasted the smallest, most elite Communist Party in the world. Meanwhile, citizens passed through highly politicized schools and universities to enter workplaces that distributed promotions and material rewards based on demonstrated political loyalty and expressions of uncritical views of ""the Revolution,"" rather than efficiency, professionalism and results. More than ever, citizens understood that cultivating certain attitudes and performing them -- on the street, in rallies, at work, even in some homes -- was essential to being seen not just as revolutionary but, in the emerging political parlance, simply ""Cuban."" In short, the will to police oneself and others in a surveillance culture went hand in hand with deference to leaders' higher will and allegedly higher political consciousness. As ¡Comandante en Jefe, ordene! became a common political slogan, the will to surveil and to follow Fidel served as primary markers of revolutionary citizenship.No wonder so many Cubans left Cuba at the end of the Revolution's first decade and no wonder so many thousands more spontaneously rushed the gates of the Peruvian Embassy in 1980 and filled the port of Mariel in subsequent weeks for the chance to live in the United States: in Cuba, not only were one-party, one-line politics impossible to escape, but the whole structure of society allowed citizens no breathing room. Put simply, whether in the form of a chess club or a ladies' sewing circle, citizen organizing without prior state authorization and representation, mostly through one's local CDR, was simply not allowed. In 1989, the collapse of the Soviet trading bloc ended a period islanders referred to as la época de las vas gordas [the time of the fat cows] and initiated what many called la época sin vacas [the time of no cows]. Labeled ""The Special Period in a Time of Peace"" by Fidel Castro, a sweeping set of reforms announced in 1992-93 reversed most of the policies of 1968. They also overturned earlier fundamental laws passed in pre-Communist years, when the goal of supportive citizens was to eliminate U.S. violations of Cuban sovereignty and foreign domination of the economy. Just as suddenly as they had once been banned, citizen entrepreneurialism, open expressions of religiosity and small-time capitalism emerged as rights -- so along as these activities did not compete directly with the state's profits or political objectives.To the shock and horror of most citizens, many of whom had come to believe in the ideological principles they passionately defended, the very military chiefs who once prohibited foreign investment and condemned neoliberal trade zones in the rest of Latin America championed a state-owned, state-run economic model based on nearly the same thing. Since 2011, Raúl Castro's policies, especially the law allowing citizens to own and sell private property, have helped to consolidate the power of these military officers and top Communist officials who, until that point, could not easily invest the salaries they earned running state-capitalist corporations and joint venture firms with foreign partners.Today, nearly a month after Raúl Castro and Barack Obama's announcements of a normalization of diplomatic relations, the wealth and power of Cuba's already wealthy and powerful political elite can only increase. With the support of former giants of the pre-1959 foreign-dominated economy, such as Cuban sugar magnate Alfie Fanjul and potentially well-known U.S. corporations such as Dole (an outgrowth of the infamously monopolistic United Fruit), one can easily imagine the creation of a classic Latin American oligarchy in Cuba, ironically founded on a post-nationalist, post-Fidel Communist state.When Fidel Castro dies -- if he is not dead already -- Cubans will face an era marked by forces and constraints similar to those they have faced in the past. In other words, el sistema is stacked against them: without the right to organize politically, let alone lead a march down any Havana street or start a chess club without permission, they enjoy little or no influence over their government and their leaders enjoy little accountability. Obviously, Fidel Castro remains primarily responsible for the policies that most affected Cubans and created both a national security state and a surveillance culture long before such terms were common. Yet, arguably most citizens know that, in the past, the creation of structures of state control in the name of national security and the strict management of an ""opposition-free"" environment relied on citizens' willingness to believe in the need for control -- or at the very least, turn the other way whenever that control was defied.Voluntarily in many cases and forcibly in others, Fidel Castro and other leaders made citizens complicit and therefore also responsible for the security on which Cuba's Communist Party-led government relies. If el sistema does not change or if Cubans feel that they cannot change it themselves, Fidel Castro's life or death will make little or no difference to Cuba's future. However, along with most islanders I know, there is no doubt that the opening of diplomatic ties between Cuba and the United States is something that many of us thought would never happen, especially in the absence of a formal declaration from Cuban state officials of Fidel Castro's death. For better or for worse, if Fidel Castro's life radically changed the historical path Cuba might have taken, there can be no doubt that his death can and will mean the same thing.This post is part of a Huffington Post blog series called ""90 Miles: Rethinking the Future of U.S.-Cuba Relations.""

Dr. Raphael Gamaliel Warnock is the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, which was once the home church of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. The Huffington Post caught up with Pastor Warnock to chat about the state of black lives in America, and continuing Dr. King's legacy.What is the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday like at Ebenezer? The Martin Luther King Jr. day holiday and the Sunday prior to the actual holiday are always an exciting time at Ebenezer Baptist church, the spiritual home of Dr. King. As you might imagine, there are a number of people still around in our congregation who knew “ML,” as they call him. Some of his classmates and his family are here. So it is special in that way for all of us here at Ebenezer, even as we take stock again of his extraordinary impact on our country and indeed the entire world.  The Martin Luther King Jr. Sunday before the holiday is a time of deep reflection upon what it means to expand Dr. King’s legacy in a new century. And so issues around mass incarceration, America’s prison industrial complex, the widening gap of inequality in America, the lack of commitment to public education, climate change -- these are all issues that get addressed on any given Sunday at Ebenezer, but they come into sharp focus. Is this year different somehow? The events of the last five months, and really the last two or three years, bring into sharp focus the relevance of Dr. King’s work. People are understanding how far we have to go. Racism has proven to be extraordinarily resourceful and flexible in its ability to reinvent itself in each era. We went from slavery to Jim Crow segregation to the new Jim Crow -- a social caste system where the hand of justice is in effect an instrument of social control, and millions of young black Americans, in particular, young black men, are stuck at the bottom of the well. We’re living in a moment where one in three black men can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. Because of this, the discrimination that an earlier generation fought against is now legal -- job discrimination, housing discrimination, being denied voting rights. The criminal justice system is now a profit-driven industry based on the warehousing of black American lives and that’s the moment we’re living in right now after gaining voting rights.Dr. King has become a mythical figure in American hearts and minds. Do you feel the weight of his legacy?  I feel no pressure to be or to channel Dr. King in a new century. I think all of us are called to our moment and to our place in time, to actualize our best gifts and to recognize our lives become significant when we turn them over to a cause larger than ourselves. Somehow, we all have to find our voice within those efforts. What is the great burden on your heart as you look at the state of Black Lives in America? There are many. The tragic killings we witnessed in Ferguson with Michael Brown and in New York with Eric Garner are sad casualties in a moment where young black men have effectively been presented as public enemy number one. That’s the deep burden on the hearts of black parents across the country. It’s deeper than the issue of police brutality. This won’t be solved by body cameras and sensitivity training. America has to come to terms with the tragic set of public policy decisions it has made over the past 35 years in which we witnessed the emergence of the prison industrial complex. We need to find the political will to address the fact that the land of freedom has become the incarceration capital of the world. What is one saying of Dr. King’s that you’re holding close to your heart this year? As I consider our struggles in fits and starts, somehow, in my ear I heard Dr. King saying, “The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice.” We have to do all we can to bend that arc and that’ what I’ve committed my life to. What is your dream for America in the coming year? That we will renew our commitment to justice, so that we will think beyond the next political cycle and elections and begin to think and work in a serious way towards a better future for the next generation. That we will have some imaginary, bold leaders who are willing to do the things necessary to ensure our long term future and to ensure that young children in America, regardless of what side of town they were born in, have a real chance.

Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring revolt began with a nucleus of young men and women, a mix of socialists, secularists and moderate Islamists seeking to end autocrat Ali Abdullah Saleh's 33-year rule and transform the poorest Arab nation into a democratic, modern society. In October 2014, nearly four years later, Yemen is in chaos and Shiite rebels have overrun the capital. Saleh is out of power, but remains powerful, with his loyalists infusing the political scene and the military. Attempts at real reform are in disarray.

Each time deranged terrorists invoking Islam strike in the West, alongside the mourning of the victims comes the heated debate over how the world's Muslims should react to the attack. Belligerent rightists demand that Muslims distance themselves from terrorists or be deemed their accomplices. Righteous leftists warn against bigotry and Islamophobia while affirming that Muslims, being overwhelmingly moderate people, have nothing to do with terrorism. And then you have the Bill Maher approach: urging Muslims to prove their overall moderation beyond simply condemning terrorism. It is a truly bizarre ritual, this rush to assess whether Muslims en masse are moderate or terror-friendly; and, in either case, to what extent. The absurdity of the exercise begins with the way mainstream western discourse defines ""Muslims"": a monolithic compact of 1.6 billion people intensely adhering to a faith by mere virtue of geography. Labeling all North Africans and Middle Easterners pious Muslims is akin to assuming that everyone who lives in America or Europe is devoutly Christian. There is a difference between cultural heritage and religious obedience. Why would the notion of a ""Christian world"" be dubious and debatable, but that of a ""Muslim world"" never be questioned? As a liberal Moroccan journalist, it was bad enough to have my state refuse me my freedom of conscience; it's all the more galling when it is Western liberals who refuse me that right with their blanket paternalistic sentiments about what ""those people"" are like.It's no wonder the West has been quick to give up on and to forget the liberal, cosmopolitan youth that fueled the Arab Spring of recent years -- a demographic that hardly fits into the Western view that everyone in these countries is primarily characterized by religiosity. Islam is not encoded in anyone's DNA. Being religious is a personal choice, one that every individual is free to make -- or not -- as stated in the Universal declaration of Human Rights. As it happens, human rights (including freedom of belief) are widely denied to the 1.6 billion persons we're talking about, by most of the governments they live under -- as well as by the prejudices of well-meaning Western liberals who bend over backwards in their politically correct efforts to be understanding of ""Muslim countries"" and their ways. What well-meaning Westerners need to understand is the wide gap between Islam as it should be -- a personal choice -- and as it most often is -- a set of pervasive constraints enforced by undemocratic states. In all the countries where Islam is the religion of the state, merely criticizing the faith (let alone leaving it) is a criminal offense. In 2007, as the publisher of the Moroccan weekly magazine Nishan, I ran a cover story about popular humor in my country. Because the issue included jokes about Islam (harmless ones at that -- the most notable one featured God assigning a deceased Muslim man of virtue to hell, before teasing him: ""Smile, it's the candid camera!""), copies of the magazine were publicly burnt by grimacing extremists, and my colleagues and I received hundreds of death threats. Yet instead of cracking down against the fanatics, the government prosecuted us for ""damaging religious morals"" and banned the magazine for three months. It's not just about mandatory religiosity. In most ""Muslim countries,"" school curricula include inescapable religious classes at every grade, with disturbing teachings about the role of women (mainly to procreate and stay at home), the duty to ""defend Islam"" and ""fight its enemies"" and so on. Grown-ups are not spared either, with omnipresent state media never losing a chance to hammer into them that Islam is the highest moral norm, and transnational Arab channels like Al-Jazeera engaging in constant ""us-versus-them"" rhetoric (""us"" being Muslims and ""them,"" Westerns, of course). Even opposition parties (mostly made of Islamist groups) do nothing but double down on religious intransigence, hoping to outdo the already bigoted official institutions. In these conditions, the psychological pressure is such that opting out of Islam is unthinkable -- or more accurately, unthought-of -- for the vast majority of the people. This is not to say that no one living in the swath of territory from Morocco to Indonesia adheres to Islam out of intimate conviction. Many obviously do. Yet as long as coercion isn't replaced by freedom of choice, the extent to which these people can be truly identified with the Islamic faith is dubious. Flatly calling 1.6 billion people Muslims -- even with the purpose of praising their moderation -- only makes you the accomplice of their oppressors. The same flawed assumptions are taking place in France. As a consequence of the horrendous Charlie Hebdo massacre perpetrated by local-born-and-bred religious fanatics, ""French Muslims"" are, once again, in the eye of the storm. Depending on the political sympathies of the commentator, they're either guilty of moral association with terrorists or misunderstood moderates. But no one is letting them off the hook for their Muslimhood.All sides of the debate presume that the five million citizens of North- and West-African descent, whose parents immigrated from former French colonies one or two generations ago, are Muslim. Many of these families are certainly religious by choice, but those who'd rather not be are afforded very little space to carry on with their secular lives -- especially amidst so many well-meaning efforts to ""understand"" the immigrant communities' ""Muslim essence."" All this despite the fact that the French republic is supposedly blind to the religious affiliations of its citizens.Secularism -- actually, headscarf-banning laïcité, a more aggressive brand of it -- is the cornerstone of modern France's founding values. Alongside fine wines, exotic cheeses and relaxed sexual mores, its church-bashing culture (of which the slain Charlie Hebdo cartoonists were the proud flag-bearers) is one of France's main staples. Any French intellectual would gasp in horror at the assertion that 60 millions of his fellow citizens are Christians, yet president François Hollande lumps together the other five million to refer to them as ""Muslims"" (who should not be conflated with terrorists, yes, we know.) French citizens of North- or West-African origin have attended the same schools as their native countrymen; and they studied Voltaire and the enlightenment age just as much as them. Unless we consider that ethnicity impacts mental processes (the definition of racism), there is no reason to believe that France's citizens of color are less receptive than others to the proud teachings of the école républicaine laïque. Yet the country's common discourse singles them out as a religious group. Liberté, egalité, fraternité? Not really. Westerners are rightly concerned about the danger posed by Islamic radicalism, but anxiously assessing the commitment of more than a billion people to religious moderation doesn't help in any way. All it does is deepen the already profound misunderstanding. When it comes to Islamic terrorism, the worthy social debate is about the way to drain its breeding ground. My two cents: promoting secular democracy in the so-called Muslim countries (and please, no need to bomb them for that -- empowering local liberals is enough) would be a good place to start."

They hit a Greek-operated fuel tanker in Derna this month, killing two seamen, after Haftar's forces claimed it was carrying Islamist fighters.A copy of an official decree obtained by Reuters recalled Haftar and 108 other former Gaddafi-era army officers for active army duty.Haftar's air force chief Saqer al-Joroushi and lawmaker Idris Abdullah confirmed the contents of the decree. It was issued weeks ago but had not previously been made public.Libya Dawn has denounced Haftar as a Gaddafi loyalist trying to stage a counter-revolution with former regime officials. Haftar helped Gaddafi seize power in 1969 but fell out with him in the 1980s after a disastrous defeat during a war in Chad.Haftar has said he only wants to rid Libya of Islamist groups such as Ansar al-Sharia, blamed by Washington for a 2012 assault on the U.S. consulate which killed its ambassador.In a video message in February he announced what some feared was a coup, though that did not materialize. Later he demanded a special council to run Libya. Haftar has also drawn support from an armed group in the western town of Zintan which was blamed for an attack on parliament in Tripoli in May.Senior officers linkled to Haftar have also been given top posts in the recall.Libya Dawn says Haftar is supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which are worried about the spread of Islamists. He denies this but some analysts wonder how the tiny air force is able to stage almost daily attacks.

'Martin Luther King was assassinated on 04 April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray confessed to shooting King and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. King's killing sent shock waves through American society at the time, and is still regarded as a landmark event in recent US history.

These men worked hard to keep their city clean and safe, yet they did so under inhumane conditions. Many were paid so little for their work that they resorted to food stamps to feed their families. By standing with Memphis sanitation workers and calling on the city to treat these black workers with dignity and respect, MLK taught us that racial and economic justice are intrinsically linked. That lesson inspires me today, because 47 years later, the fight isn't over for black and Latino workers.This is especially true here in Texas, where the $72 billion industry is one of the most prosperous and powerful in the state. It employs one in thirteen Texas workers -- roughly 70 percent of them are Latino. Dallas alone is home to around 225,000 construction workers. They build our cities and keep our economy strong, yet they do so under shocking conditions. A construction worker is more likely to die in Texas than in any other state, 50 percent earn poverty level wages, and one in five have been seriously injured on the job. These statistics put Dallas at the top of national lists for income inequality. Dallas Mayor Rawlings recently put together a task force on poverty to address extreme disparity and to make recommendations to level the playing field so the city can continue to prosper. One easy fix -- make sure our construction workers can go home safely at the end of each day.This starts with granting workers the right to rest on the job. In Texas, where summer temperatures regularly reach triple digits, nearly 40 percent of construction workers report not receiving the chance to take a short break throughout the day. Last summer, Billy Tirado, a 13-year Dallas resident, father, and construction worker, worked for a foundation repair company that denied him rest breaks. It took a toll on his health. ""Your body feels like it is suffocating."" He remembers struggling to maintain consciousness. ""I felt dizzy. My eyes got blurry. I felt nauseous."" He worried about how he would feed his three daughters if he got hurt on the job and couldn't continue bringing home a paycheck. Hearing stories like Billy's reminds me of MLK and the Memphis sanitation workers. These men dreamed of a world that honored the inherent value of all people. Yet this dream was incongruent with the reality they faced -- where racial and economic inequality dominated. In Dallas most of the workers building our roads, our homes, and our schools are Latino. They build our city, yet they face the most dangerous conditions of all. A Latino construction worker in Dallas is six times as likely as his white counterpart to work the entire day without rest breaks. Which is why in July, Workers Defense Project, a non-profit organization winning better working conditions for Texas construction workers, addressed Dallas City Council about the need for rest breaks. Six months later, City Council has the opportunity to pass an ordinance guaranteeing construction workers have the right to rest. In doing so they can drastically improve the safety and well being of some of our city's hardest workers. Martin Luther King, Jr. taught us that we will never achieve racial justice until all workers have safe, dignified working conditions. This starts with granting workers their most basic rights -- like the time to sit and drink a glass of water. The right to rest ordinance is about valuing the lives of the men and women who build our city."

With the help of her uncle, she recently obtained a divorce in an attempt to reclaim her life. Her case caused outrage and led to efforts by Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry to ban child marriages by raising the minimum age to 16. By contrast, in Iran, the Guardian Council has rejected legislative proposals to increase the age of marriage from 13 to 15 years. Even girls as young nine may be married by permission of a court. These backward laws are a reflection of the wider misogynist policies that characterize contemporary Iran. Just recently, in December 2014, in the city of Jahrom, a 22-year-old Basiji militiaman, Mohammad Beheshtifar, was arrested for stabbing several young women. This followed acid attacks in Isfahan against several young women whose faces have become permanently disfigured.

Meanwhile, the parliament is deliberating on its ""Plan to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice"" which includes a role for the Basiji militia, such as Mohammad Beheshtifar of Jahrom, to ensure strict compliance with the hijab. Human rights champion Nasrin Sotoudeh remarks that if this bill is passed ""those who engage in violence against women will certainly feel that they have protection.""These are glimpses of the grim reality of women in the Middle East, an affront to the dignity of women everywhere. But women's rights are not just a women's problem. Such violence is equally a source of profound shame for every man whose manhood is not dependent on repression of women. Sadly, too many men live in a cage of male rage. Too many are terrified of the feminine attributes of caring and empathy, lurking beneath their empty projections of masculine triumphalism. Such men desperately hide their vulnerability behind aggression.The conception of equality as a power struggle between men and women is misguided. The path of liberation is about understanding the inextricable interrelationship between the masculine and the feminine, different aspects of our own self that must find a harmonious balance to complete a human identity. This perspective was part of my childhood upbringing in Iran. Being raised in a Bahá'í family, we had all memorized this teaching on equality written by 'Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), a central figure in our early history, to whom we looked as an example:The world of humanity has two wings -- one is women and the other men. Not until both wings are equally developed can the bird fly. Should one wing remain weak, flight is impossible. Not until the world of women becomes equal to the world of men in the acquisition of virtues and perfections, can success and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.In 1853, when he was just eight years old, 'Abdu'l-Bahá was exiled to the Ottoman Empire with his family following anti-Bahá'í massacres jointly instigated by the Persian monarchy and fanatical Islamic clerics. In 1908, almost 60 years later, he was finally freed from prison, now an elderly man, and travelled to the West. When his ship arrived in New York harbor on 11 April 1912, one of the many journalists that were present asked him: ""What is your attitude toward woman suffrage?"" At this time, the arrest and hunger strike in London of the famous women's rights activist Emmeline Pankhurst was big news. In this context, 'Abdu'l-Bahá responded that: ""The modern suffragette is fighting for what must be... If women were given the same advantages as men, their capacity being the same, the result would be the same."" One can only imagine the impression that this made in the eyes of the Americans that had gathered on that day in 1912 to greet this prophet of peace from the east. Here was a man from the Islamic world of the early twentieth century who championed the cause of women's rights, still a radical proposition in the Western world! The arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst in LondonWith remarkable historical foresight, 'Abdu'l-Bahá situated the shifting balance between masculine and feminine identities in the broader context of a global transition from a civilization based on aggression to one based on intuition and empathy:The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has dominated over woman by reason of his more forceful and aggressive qualities both of body and mind. But the balance is already shifting; force is losing its dominance, and mental alertness, intuition, and the spiritual qualities of love and service, in which woman is strong, are gaining ascendancy. Hence the new age will be an age less masculine and more permeated with the feminine ideals, or, to speak more exactly, will be an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of civilization will be more evenly balanced. 'Abdu'l-Bahá in America  Seventy years later, in 1982, the Harvard psychologist Carol Gilligan published the groundbreaking In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development. Her theory of moral development maintained that women think and speak differently than men when confronted with ethical dilemmas: ""In the different voice of women lies the truth of an ethic of care, the tie between relationship and responsibility, and the origins of aggression in the failure of connection."" Therein we see how what she calls ""the failure of connection,"" the inability to form deep emotional bonds, gives rise to fear of intimacy, and male aggression. In this light, violence is the polar opposite of empathy: the man whose manhood is dependent on violence against women, lives in fear of the power of his own feminine self.Our aspiration to achieve the emancipation of women therefore begins not in the debates of the United Nations, or in the academic ivory tower, but first and foremost, in our own communities, in our intimate relations with others. It is those basic attitudes and conceptions that become the foundation of power, replicated in the violence that we witness in today's world. The Narins, Almas, Fatimahs, and Maryams of this world, remind us of the horrific consequences of a conception of manhood that depends on the subjugation of women for self-affirmation. It is thus for us men to redefine manhood, not as aggression, but as a self that is so strong and confident, that it is not in need of dominating others. In this way, the liberation of women, and the liberation of men, becomes a single, indivisible transaction, that goes to the core of what it means to be fully human."

But the balance is already shifting; force is losing its dominance, and mental alertness, intuition, and the spiritual qualities of love and service, in which woman is strong, are gaining ascendancy. Hence the new age will be an age less masculine and more permeated with the feminine ideals, or, to speak more exactly, will be an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of civilization will be more evenly balanced. 'Abdu'l-Bahá in America  Seventy years later, in 1982, the Harvard psychologist Carol Gilligan published the groundbreaking In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development. Her theory of moral development maintained that women think and speak differently than men when confronted with ethical dilemmas: ""In the different voice of women lies the truth of an ethic of care, the tie between relationship and responsibility, and the origins of aggression in the failure of connection."" Therein we see how what she calls ""the failure of connection,"" the inability to form deep emotional bonds, gives rise to fear of intimacy, and male aggression. In this light, violence is the polar opposite of empathy: the man whose manhood is dependent on violence against women, lives in fear of the power of his own feminine self.Our aspiration to achieve the emancipation of women therefore begins not in the debates of the United Nations, or in the academic ivory tower, but first and foremost, in our own communities, in our intimate relations with others. It is those basic attitudes and conceptions that become the foundation of power, replicated in the violence that we witness in today's world. The Narins, Almas, Fatimahs, and Maryams of this world, remind us of the horrific consequences of a conception of manhood that depends on the subjugation of women for self-affirmation. It is thus for us men to redefine manhood, not as aggression, but as a self that is so strong and confident, that it is not in need of dominating others. In this way, the liberation of women, and the liberation of men, becomes a single, indivisible transaction, that goes to the core of what it means to be fully human."

If she is 10 to 20 years of age, the price is higher, at $129 dollars. The highest price of $172 is reserved for girls up to the age of nine. These Yazidi women were abducted by Daesh from Mount Sinjar a few months ago as ""spoils of war."" Fourteen-year-old Narin was given as a ""gift"" to Abu Ahmed, a 50-year-old commander in Fallujah. Using her wits, she escaped to Baghdad from where she was reunited with her family near Erbil. Now she worries for her captive sister-in-law that she believes is still alive, and dreams that one day they will be reunited again. Not far away, in Syria, Alma Abdulrahman's nightmare began in a detention centre in Damascus on 29 April 2011. She was accused of being an anti-Assad rebel, brutally beaten, and repeatedly raped by soldiers, who taunted her with cries of ""here is the freedom that you wanted."" The women, she explains, were all blindfolded and a man that she calls the ""boss"" would sit in front of the rapists, teaching them ""exactly what to do and say to us,"" encouraging them to take their ""portion."" Today, Alma tells her harrowing story from a hospital bed in Amman, Jordan, her voice fading in and out, because of the morphine that keeps her pain at bay. She is unable to move her body below her diaphragm, because her neck bones were broken from the beatings. Yet she is brave, and defiant. ""We have to share this with the entire world to show that women are fighters,"" she says. ""The Arab woman is very strong. All she needs is just a little freedom.""In Saudi Arabia, Fatimah describes how in 2010, at 12 years of age, she was sold into marriage by her own father, an unemployed drug-addict. Her husband was a 50-year-old man who already had a wife and 10 children. He gave her a playstation as a wedding gift. Fatimah was a brave and strong girl. With the help of her uncle, she recently obtained a divorce in an attempt to reclaim her life. Her case caused outrage and led to efforts by Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry to ban child marriages by raising the minimum age to 16. By contrast, in Iran, the Guardian Council has rejected legislative proposals to increase the age of marriage from 13 to 15 years. Even girls as young nine may be married by permission of a court. These backward laws are a reflection of the wider misogynist policies that characterize contemporary Iran. Just recently, in December 2014, in the city of Jahrom, a 22-year-old Basiji militiaman, Mohammad Beheshtifar, was arrested for stabbing several young women. This followed acid attacks in Isfahan against several young women whose faces have become permanently disfigured. One of the victims, Maryam, was driving with her windows pulled down, when a man on a motorcycle threw nearly two liters of acid on her face, hands, and body, before speeding away. The Islamic Republic has repressed public protests by women and insists that these attacks have nothing to do with the climate of hatred against women that are ""bad hijab."" Meanwhile, the parliament is deliberating on its ""Plan to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice"" which includes a role for the Basiji militia, such as Mohammad Beheshtifar of Jahrom, to ensure strict compliance with the hijab. Human rights champion Nasrin Sotoudeh remarks that if this bill is passed ""those who engage in violence against women will certainly feel that they have protection.""These are glimpses of the grim reality of women in the Middle East, an affront to the dignity of women everywhere. But women's rights are not just a women's problem. Such violence is equally a source of profound shame for every man whose manhood is not dependent on repression of women. Sadly, too many men live in a cage of male rage. Too many are terrified of the feminine attributes of caring and empathy, lurking beneath their empty projections of masculine triumphalism. Such men desperately hide their vulnerability behind aggression.The conception of equality as a power struggle between men and women is misguided. The path of liberation is about understanding the inextricable interrelationship between the masculine and the feminine, different aspects of our own self that must find a harmonious balance to complete a human identity. This perspective was part of my childhood upbringing in Iran. Being raised in a Bahá'í family, we had all memorized this teaching on equality written by 'Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), a central figure in our early history, to whom we looked as an example:The world of humanity has two wings -- one is women and the other men. Not until both wings are equally developed can the bird fly. Should one wing remain weak, flight is impossible. Not until the world of women becomes equal to the world of men in the acquisition of virtues and perfections, can success and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.In 1853, when he was just eight years old, 'Abdu'l-Bahá was exiled to the Ottoman Empire with his family following anti-Bahá'í massacres jointly instigated by the Persian monarchy and fanatical Islamic clerics. In 1908, almost 60 years later, he was finally freed from prison, now an elderly man, and travelled to the West. When his ship arrived in New York harbor on 11 April 1912, one of the many journalists that were present asked him: ""What is your attitude toward woman suffrage?"" At this time, the arrest and hunger strike in London of the famous women's rights activist Emmeline Pankhurst was big news. In this context, 'Abdu'l-Bahá responded that: ""The modern suffragette is fighting for what must be... If women were given the same advantages as men, their capacity being the same, the result would be the same."" One can only imagine the impression that this made in the eyes of the Americans that had gathered on that day in 1912 to greet this prophet of peace from the east. Here was a man from the Islamic world of the early twentieth century who championed the cause of women's rights, still a radical proposition in the Western world! The arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst in LondonWith remarkable historical foresight, 'Abdu'l-Bahá situated the shifting balance between masculine and feminine identities in the broader context of a global transition from a civilization based on aggression to one based on intuition and empathy:The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has dominated over woman by reason of his more forceful and aggressive qualities both of body and mind.

The first was already way too familiar: Islamic fundamentalism that drives disaffected young men and women to insane violence -- in this case, the massacre of cartoonists who they felt mocked their religion.The second was something much more recondite: a French tradition of vulgar, obscene, juvenile satire that's completely unlike anything we know (or would likely be comfortable with) here in America. South Park isn't remotely close and seems mild by comparison. Trying to explain this no-holds-barred satire, the same phrase keeps cropping up in editorials, commentaries, and blogs with nauseating regularity: ""They were equal opportunity offenders."" In other words, there wasn't anyone they weren't willing to take on. Wow. It sounds very fine, doesn't it? I mean, who could be against equal opportunity, even when it comes to offense? And yet....  ""I'm marching, but I'm aware of the situation's confusion and hypocrisy."" (Dalia Ezzat via Twitter)There are only about 500,000 French Jews in a country of 66 million and France is no longer a safe home. In recent years, Jews have been the target of harassment, threats, mugging, beatings, kidnapping and torture, and murders. Those are generalities, but here are some specifics from CNN International about incidents in 2014 which are up almost 100 percent:Among the anti-Semitic incidents were reports of Jewish teens, who wore traditional Jewish items like yarmulkes, being assaulted with Tasers, tear gas and pepper spray. A Jewish teacher leaving a kosher restaurant in Paris was attacked, his nose broken and a swastika drawn on his chest. Two teens and their grandfather were chased by a group, including a man wielding an ax, as they walked to synagogue in Paris. Two French teenage girls plotted to blow up a synagogue in Lyon. A kosher restaurant in Paris was firebombed. A kosher supermarket was set ablaze in Sarcelles.French Jews aren't emigrating to Israel, England and other countries. Let's call it what it is: they're fleeing a land that's had a Jewish presence as far back as Roman times, that was the first in Europe to grant Jews citizenship, that has produced many illustrious cultural figures like Proust, Darius Milhaud, Claude Lévi-Strass, Sarah Bernhardt, and Offenbach.So when I read that Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists were ""equal opportunity offenders,"" I think that's ducking the issue. I see them as bullies, targeting the besieged Jewish minority that already lived in a state of fear. How is that laudatory? Of course, nothing I'm saying means they deserved death. But it also doesn't mean they were 100 percent heroes, either.The world doesn't seem to care about how Charlie Hebdo portrayed Jews, and would there have been such outrage if the terrorists had left Charlie Hebdo alone and only attacked Jews? Probably not in France and certainly not elsewhere. Previous assaults on Jews in France haven't sent people out onto the streets in record numbers, so we'd probably have seen a news cycle or two of stories and then silence. Until the next attack.--Lev Raphael is the author of 25 books, most recently Assault With a Deadly Lie, a novel of suspense about stalking, gun violence, and militarized police forces."

It is also considered a founding document for human rights.“It is one of the most hallowed documents in the world … written into the constitution of numerous countries and admired as a foundation stone in the Western traditions of liberty and the rule of law,” said Dan Jones, author of “Magna Carta: The Making and Legacy of the Great Charter.”After King John of England violated a number of ancient laws and customs, the country’s barons forced him to sign the Magna Carta (Great Charter) in 1215 at the small picturesque village of Runnymeade alongside the River Thames west of London.The document enumerates the church’s right to appoint its own clergy, bishops and archbishops following a bitter church-state row about who should be archbishop of Canterbury — the man appointed by King John or Pope Innocent III’s appointee, Stephen Langton.The row became so bitter that the pope excommunicated the king and declared an “interdict” on England, which meant ordinary people were denied the sacraments.“England’s bishops played a major role securing peace by acting as the middlemen in a war of interests between King John and his barons and knights that could easily have led to civil war and the break-up of the kingdom,” said Sophie Ambler, a specialist in 13th-century history at the University of East Anglia.The 2015 campaign to mark the 800th anniversary kicked off Monday (Jan. 12) with a dinner ceremony attended by the British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, U.S. Ambassador Matthew Barzun and Bishop of London Richard Chartres.Throughout the year, churches, schools, colleges, universities and libraries will hold exhibitions, lectures and other events about the Magna Carta, emphasizing the way 13th-century Christians influenced its contents.Shakespeare’s famous theater in London — the Globe — will put on a play called “The Troublesome Reign of King John.”Ceremonies marking the 800th anniversary will be held throughout the English-speaking world but the highlight will be at Runnymede Meadows where the document was signed. Queen Elizabeth II is expected to attend.There are only four copies of the Magna Carta in existence — one held at Salisbury Cathedral, another at Lincoln Cathedral and two in the British Library in London."

The situation has not particularly improved.""Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was concerned by what he called an escalation by Ukrainian forces that did not contribute to peace efforts.He later said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had rejected a peace plan contained in a letter Russian President Vladimir Putin sent him on Thursday.""In recent days, Russia has consistently undertaken efforts as an intermediary in regulating the conflict,"" Peskov said, according to TASS news agency.It said Putin's letter included a concrete plan for both sides to withdraw heavy artillery.Russian television channel NTV published the letter on Sunday evening. In it, Putin proposed ""urgent measures for the cessation of mutual shelling, and also the rapid withdrawal by the sides in the conflict of means of destruction with a caliber higher than 100 mm.""In an overnight statement, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry called on Russia to sign with Ukraine a timetable for implementing the Minsk agreement which included establishing Ukrainian control over the joint border, withdrawal of foreign forces and heavy military equipment from the region.""We are convinced that this will allow us quickly to cease fire and protect the civilian population from the firing from (separatist) fighters for the past four months,"" it said.""Ukraine steadfastly supports all the points of the Minsk agreements and demands that Russia does also,"" it said.OTHER VIOLENCEElsewhere in the region, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said two brothers aged seven and 16 had been killed and their eight-year-old sister wounded when a shell struck a house in the government-controlled town of Vuhlehirsk, 60 km (40 miles) from Donetsk.Spokesman Vyacheslav Abroskin said the shelling had come from the direction of Yenakiieve, controlled by the rebels.Poroshenko addressed several thousand people in Kiev late Sunday at a peace march in memory of those killed on the passenger bus.""We will not give away one scrap of Ukrainian land. We will get back the Donbass ... and show that a very important aspect of our victory is our unity,"" he said.Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko blamed the shelling around Donetsk on the Ukrainian army. ""We're talking about Kiev trying to unleash war again,"" Interfax quoted him as saying.The ceasefire agreed in Minsk in early September has been regularly violated since the start by both sides, and fighting has flared up again since plans for peace talks last week were abandoned.In Donetsk, a coal-and-steel city with a pre-war population of almost 1 million, residents reported a sharp upturn in fighting.The World Health Organization says more than 4,800 people have been killed in the conflict.Despite what Kiev and the West says is incontrovertible proof, Russia denies its troops are involved or that it is funneling military equipment to the separatists.With its runways pitted and cratered, Donetsk airport has long since ceased to function.But its control tower and extensive outbuildings, battered by shelling and gunfire, have taken on symbolic value, with government soldiers and separatists hunting each other, often at close range, in a deadly cat-and-mouse game among the ruins.

In 2004, Eve Ensler supplemented The Vagina Monologues, writing a transgender piece after having intimate conversations with a diverse group of women in our community. It debuted in 2004 as part of the first all-transgender performance, which was cast without regard to transgender surgical status.  That trans-inclusive piece has been performed by trans and non-trans participants around the world as part of V-Day's global fundraising efforts to end violence against women and girls. We feel it is one of many important steps which made the feminist movement more trans-inclusive.  The money our benefit performance raised went to Peace Over Violence, a trans-inclusive anti-violence nonprofit, the National LGBTQ Task Force, and V-Day's annual focus of 2004, violence against women and girls in Juarez, Mexico. The interviews and performance became the 2005 film Beautiful Daughters.  V-Day's and Eve's amazing response to concerns presented to them by trans people has been inspirational. They made extraordinary efforts to make the play and the movement trans-inclusive, changing many hearts and minds in the process.  The goal of V-Day is to create a community which raises money and raises our voices together until violence against women and girls stops. Throughout the project's history, Eve has added new monologues to include voices that were not heard in the original play.  Hurtful labels and divisiveness are antithetical to the social justice movement, which encourages building bridges and finding common ground around shared goals. We encourage all trans and genderqueer people interested in sharing their own unique voices to work with V-Day as we have.

They fought over music. When the DJ at the gala dinner unwittingly played a song used in President Al-Sisi's election campaign, many Egyptian reporters simply walked out in protest. How ironic that a conference entitled: ""Arab media -- the battle for independence"" should have done so much to highlight the glaring divisions in the Arab world -- and apparently so little to solve them! As the event ended, a Cairo talk-show host expressed dismay over speeches and discussions that he considered over-critical of Egypt's systematic crackdown on free speech -- one of the very same journalists who so gleefully exposed the wrong-doings of their last president, Mohamed Morsi, and are now refusing to rock what they claim is the only boat left.Even in Tunisia, regarded as the most successful of the Arab uprisings, journalists now worry that the winning party in the country's parliamentary elections -- including several key members from the old dictatorship -- will roll back free speech after the formation of a new government, in line with a trend sweeping much of the region.When will the world wake up to this? Press freedoms in the Arab world are dying by the hour and so is free speech, heralding a new era of ignorance, intolerance and repression. And the response from most Western governments is silence.Saddest of all, the majority of Arabs -- who saw free speech as the only gain from the Arab Spring upheavals -- now seem willing to accept the loss of this universal human right, in return for vague promises of stability and economic prosperity.Security, not democracy, is now the top priority for a critical mass of Arabs. Gone are the popular slogans of the past four years: social justice, rule of law, ending endemic corruption, democratic values, the right to information and professional media. It may be generations before independent voices are heard again in the Arab world. So has journalism in the region become an impossible job?In many ways, yes! Reporters, writers and academics who challenge the official narrative, face censorship, arbitrary trials, and violence. Many journalists have given up the struggle for a mix of reasons: out of fear, or an opportunistic desire to please the new rulers in return for personal gain. This trend has been most visible in Egypt, now the third most dangerous country for journalists after Syria and Iraq.An upsurge in domestic terrorism has strengthened Cairo's argument for a crackdown on the press and human rights -- but the measure has broad public support.Days after more than 30 soldiers were killed in two militant attacks in Sinai, editors of 17 state and privately-owned media were encouraged to pledge support for the government's anti-terrorism policies and banned criticism of the police, army and the judiciary in their publications and news broadcasts. Surprisingly, though, they didn't have it all their own way. In response, some 600 Egyptian journalists used online social media to reject their editors' position and protest against further censorship. But still, the intimidation goes on. Jordan, like most Gulf Arab states, is embracing a ""zero-tolerance"" policy towards anyone opposing its involvement in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic state of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In the last few days, police arrested the deputy head of the country's Muslim Brotherhood for criticizing the UAE's decision to name the movement and its local affiliates a ""terrorist group"". Those who do no more than press the ""like"" button on the Facebook pages of Jihadi groups, risk trials for supporting ""terror groups"".Police have now asked the Jordanian media not to report on their affairs without seeking prior permission, in line with a similar request by the army.It's not difficult to see which direction we're headed. Against this gloomy background, a few brave journalists who attended the Jordan conference have made it clear they will continue speaking truth to those in positions of power and hold them accountable for their actions. As one said: ""We chose to be society's watchdogs, we know we are operating in one of the world's most dangerous regions but we will not give up the fight for independent media and for the public's right to know."" For as long as we can, we too will insist on that very same right.--The writer, a career journalist, is ARIJ Executive Director.

Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency said on Jan. 4 it had broken up a cell in the occupied West Bank linked to Islamic State.The seven Israeli Arab suspects, aged 22 to 40 and all from the northern Galilee region, were arrested in November and December and told investigators they had undergone radical Islamist studies and prepared weapons and funding for attacks, the Shin Bet said in a statement.It said one of the defendants had tried to leave Israel in July in order to make his way to Syria but had been detained by authorities at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.Islamic State militants seized large swathes of Syrian and Iraqi territory and economic resources last year, proclaiming a caliphate and enforcing its own radical interpretation of Islam. CALIPHATEIsrael's Interior Ministry said last month it had barred five Arab citizens from traveling abroad for half a year, based on intelligence tip-offs they planned to join jihadi groups in Syria or Iraq.The ministry is separately examining the possibility of revoking the citizenship of an Israeli Arab suspected of fighting with Islamic State in Syria, from which he traveled to Turkey after being wounded, officials said.Some Israeli Arabs who returned home after helping rebels trying to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have sought to mitigate criminal charges against them by noting that Damascus is an adversary of Israel's.Ahmed Massalha, a lawyer representing three of the seven suspects, said his clients posed no threat to Israel.""Their entire intention was to restore the Muslim caliphate in Arab countries, by eliminating regimes like Assad's,"" he told Army Radio.The Shin Bet said on Sunday it had arrested an eighth Arab citizen, from the southern Negev region, on suspicion of joining Islamic State while he underwent medical studies in Jordan.(Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Jeffrey Heller)"

The adjustment has been exciting and, if I'm being honest, deeply terrifying on some levels. Standing in the pulpit where voices like Martin Luther King, Jr.; William Sloan Coffin, James Forbes -- not to mention luminaries like Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama have spoken -- it's daunting to say the least.So I've been adjusting this fall, trying to get to know the incredible people and traditions of this great institution. And I was working pretty steadily toward that end until a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri decided there would be no trial for officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed 18 year old Michael Brown.Everything began to change for me in that moment, because the day-to-day work of the pastorate became increasingly overshadowed by those questions of institutional integrity and relevance that we're all asking and have been asking for some time. Is there a future for the church? As I saw the tears and pain, grief and hopelessness of my congregation and community in response to events on the news, I kept being reminded: this is not a theoretical question anymore.Shortly after that verdict was returned, I boarded a plane with some faith leaders from around the country and spent 24 hours in St. Louis, Missouri. We gathered in a church basement, where we listened to young organizers talk about what they were doing and why. Their message was clear: the church is not showing up. The church has no relevance for me, for my life. All our potlucks and hospital visits and meticulously planned worship services are doing nothing to stop Michael Brown from dying in the middle of the street.On the way back to the hotel we drove past the new police station. Outside the station, a row of national guardsmen in full riot gear lined up shoulder to shoulder holding automatic weapons and blocking entrance to the police station. Across a parking lot stood a small crowd of protestors who have determined not to stop showing up since August 9, 2014, when Michael Brown was killed. It couldn't have been more than 20 feet that separated the two groups, but it was clear that the space between them was filled by more than concrete. It was filled with dark, fomenting nights of tear gas and smashed in storefronts. It was filled with generations of misunderstanding and mistrust, with injustice born of ignorance, fear, hatred, and apathy, filled with the legacy of broken systems and broken families, filled with the memories of sons and fathers, mothers and daughters of both law enforcement and civilians alike who would never return home again. That narrow gap of concrete held the original sin of our nation, and the sin of our fallen humanity, even the sin... of the church. In a world that considers cathedrals of stone and even the pulpit where Dr. King spoke irrelevant, what is the future of the church?I think that Jesus, having grown up going to Temple, had a high regard for the institution and the history and message it represented. Because when he got ready to start his ministry in earnest, he marched right into that storied institution and stood up to read ancient words that had, perhaps, become a little rote. They were the words of Isaiah, words about bringing good news to the poor, releasing the captives, letting the oppressed go free, ancient words of a prophet who believed that people of faith were just the ones to do that critical work. And when Jesus finished reading the text says that ""the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him."" Maybe they all sat in silence, watching with skepticism because, like us, nobody there really believed those things could ever happen in that place with any integrity or power.But Jesus just wasn't buying that.""Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing,"" he declared, which seems to me to say: all the promise, possibility, and power of God's invitation to reconciliation with the world is right here -- you just heard it. Fast forward 2000 years or so, and here we are again, hearing the ancient words of our holy text with dubious ears. Never mind young, secular organizers and protestors in Ferguson... even we don't often buy the possibility of faith communities holding power for transformation.It is easy for us to feel convicted to join a march for racial justice or the undocumented. But it's harder to stand with protesters and reach out to the police department. It is harder for us to invite into covenant not just those churches we don't know, but those very last churches we would want to be affiliated with. But we must stand in the gap because if the first time we are meeting those who are different from us is in the street in protest and anger after another tragedy, then we have failed.The deep and foundational tragedy of Ferguson and New York and so many other places across our country is that people who live and work and raise families in the same neighborhoods do not know each other, do not understand each other, and therefore cannot love each other. Whether our communities are plagued by gang violence or poverty, predatory lending or deportation threats, too many of our neighbors look at the hopelessness of the world around them and believe the words of Jesus can't possibly be true. They believe there is no release for the captives, no sight for the blind. They believe this because we haven't been there to show them any differently.This is our Gospel mandate. We must come out of our pulpits and into the streets, into the gaps of broken relationship and broken trust. We must do the hard and beautiful work of building the beloved community. Amen."

After voters went to the polls in the heavily contested presidential race, networks projected incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama has won re-election against Republican candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.

Speaker John Boehner's House of Representatives has voted to overturn all of Obama's executive actions on immigration -- putting millions of children, women and men at risk for deportation.The party of ""family values"" expressed its will in the House that immigrant families be separated, homes broken up and communities devastated. The fact that some 70 percent of those people affected are Hispanic gives this action the added onus of targeting the fastest growing American ethnic group.From a strategic standpoint, therefore, the GOP's latest aggression against immigrants only makes sense if they have already abandoned all hope of winning the 2016 presidential election. While some Republican strategists are counseling abandoning the Latino vote in favor of increasing the older white vote, their strategy is bereft of mathematical calculus and empirical anchors.Conservative writer Peter Wehner noted in a data-rich article for Commentary magazine, ""the [demographic] challenges facing the Republican Party, at least at the presidential level, are significant and fairly fundamental."" As Senator John McCain and former Governor Mitt Romney clearly demonstrated, Republicans cannot win national elections without reaching a significant threshold support from Latino voters. Neither McCain nor Romney were able to pull it off -- and Obama, who won about 71 percent of the Hispanic vote is the first president since Dwight Eisenhower to win back to back elections with more than 51 percent of the total vote.Also not coincidentally, McCain and Romney both assumed an anti-immigration, pro-deportation stance in their campaigns. Romney's share of the Hispanic vote was the lowest since Senator Bob Dole garnered a tiny slice in 1996.Boehner's attempt to disguise this mass deportation vote as some sort of strike against Obama's supposedly unlawful use of executive powers will not work. To the extent that Latinos need another reminder that the GOP is intrinsically antagonistic to Hispanics, this vote will be a permanent reminder that less than two weeks into the GOP's control of Congress, the party united in favor of deporting the maximum number of people - including children.Also not likely to be soon forgotten is the fact that this anti-immigrant vote serves no practical purpose. It will never become law. If a Democratic filibuster doesn't stop it in the Senate, it is guaranteed to be vetoed by the president.So why open the new Republican-controlled Congress with a vote that will be a large, smelly albatross over the Republican Party in 2016? One can only surmise that Boehner and his leadership team have made the calculus that losing the Latino vote for generations is acceptable to maintain the GOP's House majority. Somehow -- perhaps because of the gerrymandering of districts in 2010 by Republican-controlled legislatures, a process that has created a locked-in advantage for the GOP in the House in spite of not representing a true democratic majority -- Boehner thinks that depending on principally older, white voters is a viable strategy to win elections.After the 2012 election, when Romney's campaign crashed and burned on the shoals of a massive repudiation by Latino voters, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus called for a new approach. No longer hostile to Latinos, the party would look to support some version of immigration reform and stave off what could be a permanent absence from the White House.Of course, we know that this ""re-branding"" of the Republican Party never occurred. Quite the opposite happened, in fact. As the takeover of the GOP by increasingly radical Tea Party Republicans has advanced unabated, uber-conservative John Boehner has been accused of being the worst political creature ever imagined - a moderate. For ideologues who relate to politics like the faithful connect with religion, any deviation from right-wing orthodoxy is political apostasy. In the Middle Ages apostates were punished by crucifixion. In 2015, the punishment is a bit less gruesome: Tea Party primaries. Nevertheless, even center-right Republicans have been pushed into supporting a nonsensical strategy to castigate immigrants or face political crucifixion at the hands of 21st-century Torquemadas.Of course, political blindness is neither new nor partisan. There was a time when small factions of the Democratic Party supported some form of denuclearization of America even as the country faced the mortal threat of global Communism. This was the time, as well, when Democrats lost all but one national election between 1968 and 1988. The American electorate rejects extremists. Now Republicans will re-learn that essential lesson at the hands of a highly motivated Latino electorate, quite tired of being the target of Republican attacks."
