But I sure wish I did. I am the mother to two non-verbal boys with autism. I often long to hear the sound of them talking. Don't get me wrong, if they spoke, I would absolutely get exasperated by the repeated calls for mom, endless amounts of questions and constant negotiations. I just want to remind you, that although exasperating, the sound of their voice is also a truly amazing gift. A gift I certainly would take for granted had it had been given to me.This is my youngest son, Parker.He has 100 different smiles, all guaranteed to light up the room. He's a mama's boy, a fact that makes me glow with pride. And each time he chooses only me to soothe him, I feel like I just won a prize.We love slow dancing in the kitchen while the rest of the word falls away. Sometimes I think every love song was written just for me and him. Those are the moments I know that I've loved him not just all his life, but all mine too. He is my wildest dream come true.Parker reminds me it's OK to get dirty while you're having fun. Because of him, I don't mind a cluttered house or floor covered with toys. I pick playing with him versus cleaning. Long after he falls asleep at night, I stumble over a forgotten toy on the floor and smile as I think of him. He reminds me it's better to live an honest, painful, beautiful life than someone else's fairy tale. He makes me want to live a beautiful story about a boy with endless blue eyes and possibilities, and a mom that loves so big that it sometimes hurts.Parker has huge crystal-blue pool eyes that I like to swim in. I stare deep in memorization. Please God, I whisper, Let me remember my 2-year-old Parker. Freeze this moment for eternity and let me remember every detail. The feel of his chubby rectangular feet, his soft, smooth, baby-fine hair, a million different shades of gold. The sight of him playing outside in the backyard doing his funny little penguin run. He makes me stop at least once a day and say, Wow, God. Really? Are you sure it's OK? I can really keep him? And I still really can't believe that my heart made his heart, and because of that it's like we are always together.I remember nursing him. Our eyes locked on each other and I didn't know where he ended and I began. We were one. And then that eye contact slowly drifted away. I had to get bigger and louder to pull him out from inside his head. And I knew what to look for and I found it, and I knew what it was called.Last week, Parker had his diagnostic evaluation for autism.I woke up that morning to gray skies and pouring out rain. God is an amazing storyteller and it was a perfect scene for an imperfect day and nerve-racking day. As far as the assessments go- they weren't so bad. Parker enjoyed himself. Amongst other things, The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) assesment was administered directly to Parker. I completed the parent questionnaire called The Childhood Autism Rating Scale-CARS- 2.It all looked like mostly playing for Parker and check the box for mom. Knowing I was mainly checking ""no"" for the things developmentally based on his age that should be ""yes,"" and ""yes"" for the behaviors he has that fall in line with autism spectrum disorders. My 4-year-old son, Greyson, was diagnosed two years ago with classic autism, and although none of this is new to me, it still provokes pain like the first time, complete with the guilt of being disappointed in the outcome of such a meeting, while never for one second being disappointed in my son.Unlike Parker's older brother Greyson's diagnosis appointment, the doctor wouldn't tell me on the spot. She said it would come to me through the mail in a written report. I practically begged, If I know, I assume you know. Please don't make me neurotically check the mail every day wondering if this is the day I will open an envelope and fall to my knees. I need to hear the words said out loud. My mother's heart needs to hear it so I can move on.And although she was kind and a mother, unfortunately she was also not a rule-breaker. He seems to have behaviors and characteristics in line with an autism spectrum disorder, she finally gave me when pressed. We still need to compile all the data first. But he's got a lot of wonderful traits too. I already know that, though, deeply and with even more determined conviction on imperfect gut wrenching days like this day.I know the doctor's report will call my pot black, and it will leave my heart aching a little. And I also know that today, and even on the day we get the damn letter, Parker is still the same sweet soul whose warm wrinkled body was placed against my bare chest and into my heart almost three years ago.Parker gives me the opportunity to love greatly. To stand on tip toes and grasp a taste of a love truer than anything I've ever felt in my life. The past few years with my sweet boy have been a love story. Not the kind that you read about in fairy tales, but the real kind of love. It's messy, exhausting, painful, complicated and most importantly so bright and so beautiful that it sometimes hurts my eyes. This is life, and I'll take it all."
1,TRAVEL,7 Things You Didn't Know You Could Do on a Cruise,"U.S. News Travel, Contributor
U.S. News & World Report Travel",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-things-you-didnt-know-y_us_5b9de194e4b03a1dcc8e177a,Gone are the days when the height of cruise entertainment was limited to poolside lounging and fancy evening soirees.,2014-02-18,2014-02-18-RCI_GrandeuroftheSeasOutdoorScreen1005Fedited.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-18-RCI_GrandeuroftheSeasOutdoorScreen1005Fedited-thumb.jpg,"Gone are the days when the height of cruise entertainment was limited to poolside lounging and fancy evening soirees. Sure, you can still do both of those things, but today's cruise ships are more like mini-cities equipped with all the fixings for a day at a theme park or a night on Broadway. Even though travelers have come to expect the works from cruise liners, there are still a few things about a vacation at sea that may come as a surprise. Here are a few of the more unexpected (and in one case, undesirable) ways to pass your time on the open ocean. Courtesy Royal Caribbean InternationalIn Pictures: 7 Things You Didn't Know You Could Do on a CruiseYou can go skydivingCruisers looking to add a shot of adrenaline to their voyage need only look to the Quantum of the Seas, which embarks on its inaugural sailing in November. Royal Caribbean's newest ship boasts amenities never before seen aboard the line's fleet -- including the RipCord by iFly. This 23-foot-tall snazzy glass chamber simulates a skydiving experience (without the parachute) by creating a wind tunnel that suspends participants in the air. The currents created by four powerful fans provide travelers with the free-fall feeling without all the dangers associated with actual skydiving. Other unique features of the Quantum of the Seas include the North Star (an enclosed pod that suspends passengers 300 feet in the air for 360-degree views of the sea and the ship) and the Seaplex, an indoor gaming center with bumper cars, roller skating and a circus school complete with a flying trapeze.You can ice skate Courtesy Royal Caribbean InternationalStrapping on a set of blades may not sound that strange for those cruising to Alaska, Canada or Antarctica, but if you're sailing to the Caribbean, the last thing you would expect to find (or even want to find) is ice. But aboard several Royal Caribbean ships -- including the Allure of the Seas, the Freedom of the Seas and the Voyager of the Seas -- you can lace up and do your best impression of Scott Hamilton or Kristi Yamaguchi at the indoor arena. Skate rentals and lessons are free for all passengers, as is participation in special ice events like family and rock 'n' roll skating sessions. Royal Caribbean's ice rinks sometimes host ice shows and performances by professional skaters, which are also free to attend. See: The Best Cruise for YouYou can go on a blind date""The Love Boat soon will be making another run; The Love Boat promises something for everyone."" OK, maybe not everyone, but certainly single ladies ages 50 and older traveling on adult-oriented cruise lines like Azamara, Crystal, Oceania and Silversea. Aboard all four of these cruise lines, Gentlemen Hosts are ready to sweep women cruising solo off their feet during an elegant evening of drinks, dining and dancing. The Gentleman Host program pairs independent female travelers with dashing companions who can take the lead on the Foxtrot and carry on witty, charming conversation. Though chances are slim that an evening with a Gentleman Host will turn into a lasting partnership, women who request the presence of one of these classy companions are guaranteed a memorable evening, and the company comes free of charge. The Gentlemen Host program also partners with Cunard, Regent Seven Seas, SeaDream Yacht Club and Windstar. You can party like (and with) a rock star Courtesy Norwegian Cruise LinesMost cruises feature some sort of evening entertainment, be it Broadway-style musicals, movie screenings or fancy balls. But cruisers looking to live large will find their expectations met aboard a music-themed voyage. Cruise lines partner with a number of famous musicians to offer rocking itineraries: In 2014, Carnival will be bringing rock bands Styx, Kansas, Gavin DeGraw and REO Speedwagon on board to perform. Meanwhile, Kid Rock entertains travelers with concerts aboard Norwegian ships. Several cruise lines also take it to the next level, hosting entire music festivals. In April, the MSC Divina will host ""The Moody Blues Cruise: Return to the Isle of Wight"" with featured acts including The Moody Blues, Roger Daltrey, The Zombies and Little River Band. And Holland America's ms Eurodam will lay down some nostalgic tracks in November, during the Malt Shop Memories Cruise, which will feature such favorites as The Temptations, Martha Reeves & The Vandellas and Brenda Lee.See: The Best Cruises of 2014You can purchase artworkWhen it comes to souvenir shopping, you have a couple of options: You can amass trinkets from the many merchants who flock to your cruise's different ports of call, or you can spend your money on something more refined, like artwork. Princess Cruises is just one of the several cruise lines to offer onboard art auctions, but what sets Princess apart from other auction-toting fleets -- such as Carnival, Celebrity or Disney -- is that the line features its own in-house auction division. The members of Princess' auction team curate a collection specific to each cruise; cruisers do not need to register to participate in the onboard auctions, and all pieces are insured and mailed to your home by Princess staff. Should you prefer browsing to buying, you are welcome to visit the auction area (which doubles as a gallery space) throughout your voyage.You can learn a new language Courtesy Crystal CruisesNot all cruisers are content lying by the pool -- for those looking to absorb more than rays on vacation, Crystal Cruises' Creative Learning Institute will keep your brainwaves rolling at sea. Through the Creative Learning Institute, cruisers are welcome to try their hand (or tongue) at Spanish, Russian, Portuguese or French -- among other languages -- depending on the region you're visiting. Crystal Cruises' language instruction is offered through Berlitz, a company that specializes in fast-pace language learning using vocabulary and pronunciation training. Like all of the enrichment programs at Crystal's Creative Learning Institute -- which include tai chi, art history and computer classes -- the Berlitz language instruction is covered in your cruise fare. This means you can worry less about your budget and focus more on your verb conjugations. You can go to cruise jailBelieve it or not, ""cruise jail"" really does exist. Cruises, like cities, boast a wide array of things to do and places to eat, but they also feature rules to which passengers must adhere. The consequences for breaking those rules vary depending on the severity: Should a cruiser's actions pose a threat to other passengers, the offender will likely be placed in ""cruise jail"" more formally known as the brig -- a small holding cell with little to no furnishings. Depending on captain's orders, a trip to the brig will either result in lockdown for the remainder of the cruise followed by a fine or arrest upon return; or, the captain may decide to simply leave the unruly passenger with local authorities at the next port of call. Neither option sounds like as much fun as ice skating or skydiving, so be sure to hold on to some of your inhibitions while sailing the high seas.In Pictures: 7 Things You Didn't Know You Could Do on a Cruise-- Miriam B.

Yes, there are curiosities here, but seeing them is just one reason to visit the town where Mark Twain lived and wrote his most well-known books, and where Harriet Beecher Stowe decided to settle after commotion from her book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, died down a bit. Ten years -- hell even five years ago -- friends may have looked askance if you mentioned a pleasure trip to Hartford, CT. But with a new billion-dollar entertainment/hotel/residential/convention district, a new state of the art science museum, and multi-million dollar upgrades to attractions and hotels, Hartford might just be a new hot spot. Here are 10 reasons why.1. You can see Mark Twain's bicycle, a large Gilbert Stewart portrait of George Washington, rooms in which the Amistad captives were tried, and a two-headed calf all in the same building: Connecticut's Old State House . A nifty 1996 renovation includes a wonderful interactive exhibit: History Is All Around Us, which illuminates street name origins and iconic American brands made in Hartford and Connecticut. Both Underwood and Royal typewriters were manufactured in this publishing center, Colt still makes firearms for military, law enforcement and consumers, and Mom's favorite -- Wifle Balls and Bats -- are manufactured nearby. Upstairs, tour the old Court Room where the Amistad slaves and abolitionist Prudence Crandall were tried, and the House of Representatives chamber where PT Barnum served. Also on the 2nd floor, you'll find the ""Museum of Curiosities"" stocked with oddities like the very popular Barnum/Ripleyesque taxidermied Two Headed Calf.2. Tour the fanciful Connecticut State Capitol and Legislative offices, connected via an underground tunnel serviced by an airport-style moving walkway. Opt for a group or self-guided tour of this golden domed wedding cake of a State Capitol. Though the statues and State Seals and interior décor are worth a glance, it's the aura of government that most compels. Walk around and you'll see men and women in fine suits making deals, discussing policy and otherwise going about the business of state. If you care to, pop into the Governor's office (now Dannel Malloy) to say hi. 3. Step inside a Hurricane Force wind tunnel, and introduce yourself to a turtle with its own Twitter account (@imaboxturtle) among three floors of interactive exhibits in the new Connecticut Science Center. Nine stories tall, with growing room for more exhibits, you can spend the good part of a day giving SimMan a heart attack, racing via virtual skis on Downhill Racer, creating a 360 degree photo of yourself, and perfecting your B'Ball game though computerized feedback, among a slew of other innovative science exhibits that border on arcade games. Museums like this are the key to making science entertaining and relevant for the newest generations, but you don't have to be a kid to have a blast here.4. Peruse one of the best collections of Hudson River School of Art Paintings in America's First Public Art museum known for its cutting edge exhibitions, the Wadsworth Atheneum. Finishing up a $33 million renovation, the first museum in the US to display works by Salvador Dali, Joan Miro, Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst and plenty of others from ancient to modern, will once more be touted as World Class and worth a drive from anywhere. 5. See the contraption that ruined Mark Twain financially at the Mark Twain House and Museum. Twain fancied himself a Venture Capitalist, but in fact was a lousy businessman (except for his one good call: publishing what was to become the best-selling Presidential memoirs of all time -- that of Ulysses S. Grant). While living in Hartford, Twain invested most of his fortune in a typesetting machine called the Paige Compositor. He expected to make millions., but the device was too unwieldy and complex and never took off, leaving Twain nearly broke. You can see a prototype of the Compositor in the Mark Twain House and Museum.6. Learn about Mark Twain's family and writing life in his Hartford home, from which he wrote Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (as well as A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and others). A lover of gadgets, Twain was one of the first homeowners in the 1870s to have central heating, a burglar alarm and a private telephone, and hired Louis C. Tiffany to design the first floor and common rooms on the 2nd. How did Southern-born and raised Twain come to marry a Yankee girl? What kind of father was he to his children? Take the house tour for a very intimate glimpse into to the life of one of the country's most beloved writers.7. The author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe, moved in next door to Mark Twain and her home has just been designated a National Historic Landmark -- The Harriet Beecher Stowe Center. Stowe composed what was to become Uncle Tom's Cabin as a serialized story in the Washington DC Abolitionist newspaper, The National Era, never expecting much response from the public. But her installments garnered so much attention and controversy; she was pressed to turn it into a book. Uncle Tom's Cabin became a phenomenon, with sales in the 19th century bested only by St. James Bible. A visit here is sure to elicit discussions about slavery, slurs, and the current state of race in America.8. You can take a downtown loop bus for free. Board DASH to explore downtown Hartford: no need to dig into your wallet for fare at 12 stops beginning at Connecticut Convention Center on Front Street.9. You can eat well in a growing number of great restaurants. Local favorites include the clubby Max Downtown, convivial Salute, Dish Bar and Grill and Trumbull Kitchen, and inventive sushi bistro Feng. More are coming online every month, making this former epicurean wasteland a new foodie destination. 10. Stay in the newly developed Front Street District. Over a billion dollars was spent to spiff up this near riverfront section of Hartford, and a newly refreshed Hartford Marriott Downtown is optimally located next to the Convention Center, the Connecticut Science Center and across from a new Cinema multiplex. Rooms are Marriott fine, service is exemplary, and repeat customers get a warm, personalized ""welcome back.""

The pressure of a presidency is immense -- meetings, traveling, lawmaking and diplomacy only begin to scratch the surface. But while running a country leaves little room for downtime, America's leaders, past and present, still try to make some room for recharging.Finding that time to relax --whether you're the president or climbing the corporate ladder -- isn't only a perk, it's crucial. Mental fatigue and workplace burnout threaten numerous professionals in high-pressure, high-strung jobs, causing serious stress and health risks.Research has proven that planning a vacation and prioritizing work breaks are key to well-being -- and no one understands that more than our nation's leaders. Below, check out some of the relaxation habits of our former (and our current) presidents. If they can make the time to unwind, then we certainly can, too!Barack Obama's best relaxation tool is his family. In a 2009 interview with the BBC, Obama said that taking a few moments to step out of the chaos and into a place of normalcy is the best way to refocus. ""Nothing is better at pulling you out of your world than having a couple of children,"" he said. ""I'm grateful I have such a wonderful wife and kids. That's my main form of relaxation now."" The current commander-in-chief also said he enjoys a game of basketball or diving into a good novel during downtime.Abraham Lincoln found solace in a secluded cottage. Leading a tumultuous country in the midst of a civil war and suffering from personal losses was more than enough trauma for one president. When Lincoln needed some space from stress, he'd often escape to the Soldiers' Home in Washington, D.C. America's 16th president lived at the location, now known as Lincoln's Cottage, for part of his presidency and would actually commute to the White House.Dwight D. Eisenhower cultivated calm by working on his golf swing. Known as one of the top golfing presidents, Eisenhower liked to de-stress on the green. He played more than 800 rounds of the game during his terms, and under his direction, the White House installed a putting green on the South Lawn in 1954. Since then, other golfing presidents such as Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Obama have all used the putting green as a way to unwind.Herbert Hoover unwound with his fishing reel. Hoover relaxed from the pressures of a presidency during times of economic duress by fishing. He enjoyed spending time out on the water from the time he was a boy. ""When all the routines and details and the human bores get on our nerves, we just yearn to go away from here to somewhere else,"" Hoover said in a 1951 speech. ""To go fishing is a sound, a valid and an accepted reason for an escape. It requires no explanation.""John F. Kennedy blew off steam by sailing. Growing up spending summers on the water, Kennedy learned how to sail at a young age. His love for the sea transcended his short life and presidency, and he was photographed numerous times de-stressing on the boat with his wife and family. In his remarks at the Australian Ambassador's Dinner for the America's Cup Crews in 1962, Kennedy poetically described his love for the ocean:I really don't know why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea, except I think it's because in addition to the fact that the sea changes, and the light changes, and ships change, it's because we all came from the sea. And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have, in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea -- whether it is to sail or to watch it -- we are going back from whence we came.For more on relaxation, click here."

(AP Photo/David J. Phillip )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9de0952100005100c5b1be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dorene InternicolaNEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - For everyday athletes hoping to glean more than vague inspiration from watching the elite compete at the Olympic Games in Sochi fitness experts say let the mind games begin.With imaging techniques, meditation and biofeedback, sports psychologists, athletes and coaches say Olympians and top performers train as intensely mentally as they do physically.Lauren Sesselmann, whose Canadian Olympic soccer team captured a bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Games in London, said while the physical prowess has to be there, a healthy mindset might play an even bigger part in success.""We do a lot of mental training,"" said Sesselmann. ""You have to push yourself and to put goals before yourself every day.""Motivation was never a problem for Sesselmann, 30. The creator of ""Fit As a Pro"" workout DVDs says she always relished hitting the field, playing against the boys and even driving two hours to play against the best high school in her state.""I've always been a really competitive person, even if I'm playing a video game,"" she said.But Sesselmann credits the mental strategies learned in the team's so-called ""mind room"" with helping her counter inevitable Olympic stressors from a bad practice day to a truncated personal life to being far away from family and friends.""In one program, called Brain Paint, you put yourself into a state of relaxation and imagined yourself doing well for 20 minutes while a psychologist watched your brain waves,"" she explained.Another, called Heart Math, focused on breathing techniques. Sesselmann, who is in Vancouver preparing for the 2015 World Cup, said she regularly meditates before game time.Sharon Chirban, a sports psychologist with Children's Hospital Boston who has worked with Olympian skiers, hockey players and figure skaters, said along with talent, determination, and commitment, the elite athlete exhibits a high tolerance for frustration and challenge.They're just better at overcoming discomfort, she said.""Whenever I go to the gym with my fiancé, who is a former Olympian bobsledder, I work out 20 percent harder than I do on my own,"" Chirban said.For people who excel, she explained, there's always a bit more to do.""They teach the average person that no one gets there without a lot of hard work,"" she said. ""Everyone's looking for the magic bullet but there's no short road.""Gregory Chertok, a sports psychology coach and mental skills trainer with the American College of Sports Medicine, finds that elite athletes eagerly embrace the mental game, happily honing practice tools such as visualization and relaxation techniques to manage anxiety on the field.""They'll dedicate as much as 30 minutes every day to writing down goals, or imagery, or taking time to be mindful,"" said Chertok, who has a hockey client at the Sochi games.He added that sports psychology borrows much from the eastern philosophy of mindfulness and, although it has become mainstream in the past 25 to 30 years, is still in relative infancy compared to other branches of exercise science, such as strength training.""It's not about Buddha sitting cross-legged but about putting oneself in a relaxed position and training to be in the now,"" he said. ""The elite athlete will have this shelf of mental images that they can call on in times of boredom or laziness to keep moving forward.""Chertok said he once asked a group of female cross-country runners what motivates them when they're nearing the finish line with nothing left in the tank.""One girl yelled, 'Pasta!' It was her favorite meal and her reward, but only if she gives all in her event,"" he said. ""That one vivid mental picture affected her breathing and her muscular level, and helped her perform better."" (Editing by Patricia Reaney, Bernard Orr)"
