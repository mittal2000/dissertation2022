It involves heating the milk to at least 161 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 15 seconds and then rapidly cooling it.""It's kind of like riding in a car with seatbelts,"" Kathryn Boor said. ""If you've got the opportunity for a safety barrier, which would be pasteurization, why wouldn't you use it?""Boor studies food safety at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where she is also the dean of Agriculture and Life Sciences. She was not involved in the new report.At least 97 percent of dairy products consumed in the U.S. are pasteurized, the committees wrote in Pediatrics, the journal of the AAP.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibits shipping raw milk for human consumption across state lines, but its sale is still legal in many states. Raw milk can carry bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella from sick animals or contact with manure, for instance.Still, some groups promote raw milk based on studies suggesting it is tied to a lower risk of allergies and asthma.Boor said those studies looked at children who also spend a lot of time outside and working on farms - kids who are probably different in many ways from those who drink pasteurized milk and live in the suburbs.""While those studies are really tempting to link (raw milk and fewer allergies), I think that the picture is considerably more complicated than that,"" she told Reuters Health.Claims that raw milk has nutrients that are killed by pasteurization also haven't been supported, researchers said.When it comes to raw milk, Boor said, ""We can quantify the risks. We cannot quantify the benefits. And the benefits at this point are vague and not really substantiated scientifically.""According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 148 disease outbreaks tied to raw milk or raw milk products were reported in 1998 through 2011. Those caused 284 hospitalizations and two deaths.""Contamination during milking or storage or milking from cows that may be diseased, exposes the consumer to severe and life-threatening illnesses such as miscarriage and still births in pregnant women, meningitis and blood infections in both young infants and pregnant women,"" Dr. Jatinder Bhatia told Reuters Health in an email.Bhatia, from Children's Hospital of Georgia in Augusta, is one of the lead authors of the AAP statement.In addition to babies and pregnant women, raw milk poses a health risk for people with compromised immune systems and the elderly, he said.""The evidence overwhelmingly establishes the benefits of pasteurization on safety without proven adverse effects of pasteurization,"" Bhatia said.The International Dairy Foods Association, a trade group, says on its website that ""All milk intended for direct consumption should be pasteurized - it's a matter of food safety.""Boor grew up on a dairy farm and was raised on raw milk.She said she favors giving people a choice when it comes to the type of milk they drink. But most people may not understand the risks of raw milk or accurately envision what goes on at a farm. Cows can be sick for a while before it's noticeable, Boor said, or the milking machine can drop off the cow and fall on the ground and get contaminated.""Pasteurization is a very simple step, and that's all that it takes to put up that barrier, to prevent that problem,"" she said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1kCYrQ1 Pediatrics, online December 16, 2013.Copyright 2013 Thomson Reuters.

3,WELLNESS,How Yoga Became A $27 Billion Industry -- And Reinvented American Spirituality,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-yoga-industry-los_us_5b9db800e4b03a1dcc8bf130,"“In the West, there are streams where this authentic transmission from living masters to students still exists,” Viniyoga",2013-12-16,"Participants take part in a mass yoga class to mark the summer solstice on Times Square in New York, June 20, 2012. Thousands of yogis gathered on Times Square to celebrate the longest day of the year during the event which features four free mass yoga session at the heart of Manhattan. AFP PHOTO/Emmanuel Dunand (Photo credit should read EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db8001f00002d0021ba0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1971, Sat Jivan Singh Khalsa moved to New York to open a yoga studio. A lawyer moonlighting as a Kundalini yoga teacher, he set up shop in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, opening a school to share the teachings of the spiritual leader Yogi Bhajan. At that time, there were only two other yoga studios in the city.   It was a time, as Khalsa told The Huffington Post, when “people confused yoga and yogurt. They were both brand new and nobody knew what either of them were.”   In the more than 40 years since Khalsa opened his school, he has watched as yoga in America has evolved from a niche activity of devout New Agers to part of the cultural mainstream. Dozens of yoga variations can be found within a 1-mile radius of his studio in Manhattan’s Flatiron District, from Equinox power yoga to yogalates to “zen bootcamp.” Across America, students, stressed-out young professionals, CEOs and retirees are among those who have embraced yoga, fueling a $27 billion industry with more than 20 million practitioners -- 83 percent of them women. As Khalsa says, “The love of yoga is out there and the time is right for yoga.”  Perhaps inevitably, yoga’s journey from ancient spiritual practice to big business and premium lifestyle -- complete with designer yogawear, mats, towels, luxury retreats and $100-a-day juice cleanses -- has some devotees worrying that something has been lost along the way. The growing perception of yoga as a leisure activity catering to a high-end clientele doesn’t help. ""The number of practitioners and the amount they spend has increased dramatically in the last four years,"" Bill Harper, vice president of Active Interest Media's Healthy Living Group, told Yoga Journal. More than 30 percent of Yoga Journal’s readership has a household income of over $100,000. As American yoga master Rodney Yee remarked at a 2011 Omega Institute conference, compromising the authenticity of the practice and ignoring its traditions is “ass-backwards.” “It dumbs down the whole art form,” he said.  Others are more optimistic about the evolution of yoga in America, welcoming the conversations and occasional yoga-world infighting that have accompanied its rise.  “If you value yoga and the traditions it comes from, it’s a good problem to have,” Philip Goldberg, a spiritual teacher and author of American Veda, tells The Huffington Post. “Ever since the ideas of yoga came here in book form and then the gurus started to arrive, it’s all been a question of how do you adapt these ancient teachings and practices, modernize them and bring them to a new culture, without distorting or corrupting them, or diluting their effect? That’s really the key issue here.”  Of course, much of yoga’s appeal is the fact that it can be traced back roughly 5,000 years -- in a world of exercise trends and diet fads, it’s a tradition that has stood the test of time. Traditionally, Yoga (Sanskrit for “divine union”) has one single aim: stilling the thoughts of the mind in order to experience one’s true self, and ultimately, to achieve liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara), or enlightenment.  The Westernized, modernized form of the ancient practice expresses just one component of what was originally considered yoga. The physical practice of postures, or asana, is one of eight traditional limbs of yoga, as outlined in the foundational text of yoga philosophy, The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, thought to be over 2,000 years old. These limbs present a sort of eightfold path to enlightenment, which includes turning inward, meditation, concentration and mindful breathing. The Sutras make no mention of any specific postures, but the original 15 yoga poses were later outlined in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, dated to the 15th century CE, making it one of the oldest surviving texts of hatha yoga, the yoga of physical exercises.   The way we practice asana -- usually in a crowded, mirrored room -- has also changed over the years to suit modern needs. Traditionally, yoga was a private, personal practice that involved a sacred bond between student and teacher (guru), part of the oral system of imparting knowledge known as guru-shishya paramparya.“In the West, there are streams where this authentic transmission from living masters to students still exists,” Viniyoga founder Gary Kraftsow said at the Omega Institute Being Yoga conference in 2011. “But there’s a lot of yoga that’s made up, modern stuff, with no understanding of depth and meaning of text.”  Although the guru-student tradition may have gone the way of the loincloth (which was, yes, the original yogawear), Indian knowledge has been steadily spreading in the West since the 19th century (Henry David Thoreau is commonly said to be the first yogi in America). But the physical practice didn’t really catch on until the “new cultural era” of the 1970s, a time of surging interest in both spirituality and physical fitness, Goldberg explains.  “Following the fitness and exercise boom in America, it was the physical practices [of yoga] that caught on,” he said.  That fitness and exercise boom -- propelled by the emergence Richard Simmons and Jane Fonda as fitness stars, and the at-home video workout -- led to growing scientific interest in yoga and meditation. More and more American research demonstrated their measurable physical and mental health benefits, legitimizing yoga in the eye of the public.  Today, yoga has come to be seen as something of a panacea for the ailments of modern society -- tech overload, disconnection and alienation, insomnia, stress and anxiety. And in many cases, the timeworn technique is the perfect antidote to the modern speed of life that’s created a culture of stress and burnout. Yoga has been shown to help fight everything from addiction and lower back pain to diabetes and aging, in addition to boosting overall well-being and stress relief.  “Yoga is a traditional way of easing pain and people are flocking to it,” says Khalsa. “We’re on our phone all day, in front of the TV, in front of our computer. We hardly ever get away from it. But you can come to a yoga class and get rid of all this ‘stuff.’”  Still, it’s the tradition that many worry is being lost. Yoga’s proven health benefits don’t mean that every form of adaption of the practice is valuable, says Goldberg. “People are very concerned about this, and for good reason,” he says.  Variations began to proliferate as research on yoga’s health benefits became more robust. At that time, the practice became more widely accepted -- and the industry started to cash in.  “The sudden boom of interest led to people wanting to fill the demand by getting more teachers trained, and studios discovering that they can make more money training yoga teachers than giving classes in some cases,” says Goldberg. “The standards can get compromised along the way.”  The new emphasis on asana meant that yoga institutions could train new instructors to teach physical poses without necessarily knowing much about the larger framework of yoga.  Balancing the old and the new is the “number-one challenge” for the Yoga Alliance (YA), the largest nonprofit association representing yoga teachers, schools and studios, according to CEO Richard Karpel.  “[When] the Yoga Alliance created standards for teacher training programs back in 1999, one of the primary focuses was on respecting diversity … nobody wanted an organization to tell people how to practice or teach yoga,” Karpel told The Huffington Post. “By [2011], the balance had shifted … where the concern was more about rigor.”  Currently, all YA-certified, 200-hour teacher training programs include 20 hours of philosophy, intended to give teachers a deeper understanding of the practice’s origins. “Every studio, every teacher, and every teacher-training program counts,” Karpel says, adding that YA recently implemented a new social credentialing system to gain more feedback on various teacher-training programs.  “Yoga’s very popularity creates the possibility of corruption and distortion, and lowest common denominator teachings,” says Goldberg. “The very fact that if you ask the average person what yoga is, they immediately think of a beautiful woman doing stretches and bends, that tells you how commercialized it has become, and how limited. What yoga has meant for thousands of years is not just that.”  Complaints about the commercialization of yoga go as far back as the Beatles’ 1968 trip to India, but as the multibillion-dollar industry has grown, so have efforts to keep the practice rooted in tradition.  In 2010, the Hindu America Foundation (HAF) launched the “Take Back Yoga” movement to raise awareness about the practice’s Hindu roots. “Our issue is that yoga has thrived, but Hinduism has lost control of the brand,” HAF cofounder Dr. Aseem Shukla told The New York Times.  The movement didn’t gain much traction, but it did spark a conversation about yoga’s modernization and adaptation. Religion aside, some have argued that yoga has become an elitist practice that’s inaccessible to the majority of Americans. As one Bustle writer put it, “inner peace comes with a high price tag.”  The presentation of the female “yoga body” in the media has also drawn criticism.  ""The yoga body is Gwyneth Paltrow's body -- the elongated feminine form,"" Karyln Crowley, a women’s studies professor at St. Norbert College, recently told ELLE. ""That is still the way yoga is represented in mainstream media.""  And of course, many have noted the irony that a practice originally intended as a vehicle for transcending the ego has become a seemingly vanity-driven pursuit. Wellness junkies share Instagram shots of kale smoothies and selfies of figure-contorted inversions and balancing postures -- there are more than 400,000 photos tagged #yogi on Instagram, enough to warrant a New York Times trend piece.“Isn’t yoga supposed to be about turning your gaze inward?” the Times quipped.  But in true yogic fashion, Khalsa and some other more traditional practitioners, like ViraYoga founder Elena Brower, are unperturbed by these changes.  When Brower practices and teaches yoga, she puts a personal issue at the forefront of her mind -- something that she’s confused or conflicted about. While she’s practicing, she is simply with that issue, “until all the movements in my body and the way I’m paying attention to my breathing can actually shift the way my brain is holding that thing.”  The veteran yogi and Art of Attention co-author invites thousands of students into her SoHo studio each week to help them get away from the stress of the city.  “Yoga is the time where we don’t have our phone, we are just with ourselves, our bodies and our movements,” Brower said. “There’s something very magical about that time; something very important and healing about giving yourself that time.”  Her work as a teacher, Brower explains, is to simply give people that opportunity for self-healing. “The job is one of just holding space for people to do their own healing.”  With the fitness era giving way to the explosive growth of interest in wellness and mindfulness practices, more and more Americans are taking health and healing into their own hands, and the role of yoga is evolving yet again, making the gradual move from a purely physical activity to a tool for holistic healing. This time it’s not just focused on the body, but also the mind.  “There’s a level of consciousness and an evolving way that people are talking and thinking,” Jivamukti Yoga CEO Celina Belizan told The Huffington Post. “It’s this new language that people are talking in more and more.”  More and more studios, like Jivamutki and Virayoga -- popular downtown Manhattan yoga centers -- are embracing the spiritual elements of the practice, drawing students into their studios with chanting, meditation and traditional teachings.  The rise of “spiritual but not religious” has supported this return to yoga’s traditional teachings. More than 1 in 3 Americans describe themselves as spiritual but not religious, according to a 2012 Pew Forum survey.  Goldberg explains that this inward-facing spirituality -- in which individuals, whether or not they ever set foot on a yoga mat, turn inward to develop a connection with something larger than themselves -- is fundamentally a yogic one, and that in fact, we are becoming a “nation of yogis.”  “People are taking charge of their spiritual lives in a very yogic way,” he says. “That’s changing the face of spirituality in the West.”This story appears in Issue 80 of our weekly iPad magazine, Huffington, available Friday, Dec. 20 in the iTunes App store.

They freed the American Korean War veteran they were holding hostage, only to follow that up with baby-faced Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un executing his uncle, considered the #2 man in the regime.As we've been traveling around the world we visited North Korea, a sort of kitschy Stalinist holdover from the Cold War that is still mired in the past; a place where the Korean War could have happened only last week. We had a very different feeling in Vietnam, another Southeast Asian country with whom America fought, but has reacted very differently to that conflict.The contrast between North Korea and Vietnam was made very clear based on two events that occurred only months apart in 1968: the Pueblo Incident and the My Lai Massacre.In January 1968 the North Koreans captured the USS Pueblo, an American naval vessel that had been steaming through international waters as it monitored North Korean radio traffic. One crew member was killed during the capture while 82 others were held hostage for 11 months. The ship is still held in the DPRK, the only commissioned US naval vessel to be held by a foreign power. The incident is little remembered in the United States but in North Korea the ship is revered as a symbol of the small country's military might.When we were in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, we visited the Pueblo. By all credible accounts the North Koreans attacked the barely-armed vessel with five ships and a pair of MiG fighter planes. The story we were told onboard was a bit different. Our group was herded into the crew's mess where we watched a 15-minute propaganda video of the North Korean interpretation of the events. This consisted mostly of harangues against America and really grainy footage of President Lyndon Johnson looking demonic. What the video lacked in facts it made up for in rage and indignation.We climbed on deck where the guide explained how the skirmish unfolded. According to the guide's retelling, the mighty Pueblo was captured by a mere eight North Korean soldiers who found the captain ""quivering"" under a table. We had been warned before entering North Korea that we were not to point out to the hosts that their interpretation of historical events was different from ours. If we did the tour would come to an abrupt end and, besides, we weren't going to convince them anyway. The facts as they knew them had been drilled into them for years -- since birth really.One member of our group, Jeff, developed a finely honed knack for asking questions in such a subtle way that showed he wasn't buying it. He asked innocently, ""How did only eight soldiers capture eighty-three Americans and a Navy ship?"" The guide responded in all sincerity, ""They were very brave."" One of the sad things that the tour of the Pueblo revealed was how much the North Koreans cling to the past. The incident looms large in the country's history and is put forth as an example of the superiority of their political system. At one time ""Remember the Pueblo"" was a rallying cry in the United States. Today I bet 95 percent of Americans who were born after the Pueblo Incident aren't even aware of it; but to the citizens of North Korea this minor clash that occurred over forty years ago is a major victory in their country's history. We had a very different reaction in Vietnam, where I visited the sight of the My Lai massacre. In March 1968 (only two months after the capture of the Pueblo) a company of American soldiers entered the South Vietnamese hamlet and killed over 400 civilians. The village has been recreated to look as it did that day after the soldiers left it. Thatched huts are burned out and the muddy paths through the rice paddies have been rebuilt from brown concrete. Before the concrete hardened, bare footprints of men, women and children being dragged to their deaths were placed in it to represent the killing frenzy that occurred here. These footprints were interspersed with the impressions of thick Army boots. It's a heartbreaking place to visit.As I stood in the hamlet, contemplating what happened that fateful day, a multi-generational family of Vietnamese walked up to me. Their ages ranged from 6 to 76, and were representative of the people killed 45 years ago. A teenaged girl who spoke English approached me and asked where I was from. Considering where I was standing I hesitated and said, ""America.""Their reaction surprised me. After the girl relayed my answer the family surrounded me, taking turns shaking my hand and repeating, ""U.S.-Vietnam friends now. U.S.-Vietnam friends now.""The Pueblo Incident and the My Lai Massacre; two tragedies that occurred only two months apart. Yet the reaction of the two countries today is so different. Vietnam is a forward seeking country that doesn't wallow in the past. Things are moving too quickly there to let old grudges fester.Meanwhile the totalitarian North Korean regime uses events like the Pueblo Incident to prop up the regime; to scare their people into believing that an attack is imminent. It's why they held an 85-year-old American hostage. Anything that supports their storyline that it's ""North Korea against the world"" helps those in charge. Until they focus more on the future, things will never change in North Korea; but that's how the ruling regime likes it. For them, change is not good.For us, traveling to North Korea and Vietnam revealed so much more about those countries and their people than we could get by reading about them. To better understand a place it's valuable to go there and take a peek behind the curtain.For more stories from North Korea, Vietnam and around the globe visit us on our blog at Changes in Longitude."

The funnyman got to stand in the presence of West's ""awesomeness"" while filming ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,"" in which the rapper makes a cameo. When asked during an appearance on ITV's ""Jonathan Ross Show"" what it was like, Ferrell confirmed that West was on his  typical behavior.""It was very surreal to have Kanye -- who's such a big fan of comedy -- in our movie hanging out for two days"", he said. ""He was playing the new tracks a lot -- over and over. Even when you're trying to film, he's playing the tracks.""The ""tracks"" are the ones that comprise ""Yeezus,"" which was released in June, right around the same time West filmed his cameo for ""Anchorman 2."" Naturally, the cast and crew were too intimidated to ask West to stop blaring his music on the set. ""We got a scared 18-year-old intern to ask him to turn them down,"" Ferrell joked before revealing that West lingered around the set after his scenes were finished. ""He hung out, even after we said, 'You're done'. He was like, 'no, no' and stayed in the background, hanging out and fighting with people.""Ferrell's questionable sincerity aside, director and co-writer Adam McKay made similar remarks when asked about the matter in June.""He even showed up for an extra quarter of a day where he had no speaking lines,"" McKay told MTV. ""He was just kind of in the group fight sequence, and he was having so much fun that he came back to do that.""Ferrell and McKay discussed the experience with Rolling Stone earlier this month, revealing that Kim Kardashian spent some time on the set and that West rapped ""New Slaves"" for them in hopes of soliciting feedback. ""She was there the first day,"" McKay said of Kardashian, who at the time was a month away from giving birth to North. ""She seemed like this totally normal, pretty girl -- not the most-Googled woman on earth.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that ""Yeezus"" was released in May."

""And I feel like the only way that was ever going to work is if it just fell into place beautifully, and if everybody was on board, because we couldn’t do anything to risk what 'Friday Night Lights' has already been.”Britton, a.k.a. fan favorite Tami Taylor, echoes what various cast members were apparently saying about the project. Peter Berg, who directed the 2004 film and developed the TV series, told Collider that some weren't on board with returning for more action with the Dillon High School Panthers.""There's not gonna be a movie,"" Berg said. ""We talked about it, some people thought it was a good idea, some didn't. I've come to believe it's probably not a good idea, and I seriously doubt it's gonna happen.""Taylor Kitsch, who played Tim Riggins, was more definitive when Vulture asked him recently whether he's interested.""I'll just say no,"" Kitsch said. ""No, period. I'm not doing it. I'm never gonna be in that movie. There was already a movie! And the show ended f--kin' spot-on. We're good.""Still, Britton -- who once blamed Emmy winner Kyle Chandler on the holdup -- at one point was in possession of the potential movie's script, and producer David Hudgins did carry on the notion that it was in the works when the cast reunited at June's ATX Television Special. ""I think it’s just a matter of finding a time when everyone can do it,"" Britton told Ladies' Home Journal at the time."
