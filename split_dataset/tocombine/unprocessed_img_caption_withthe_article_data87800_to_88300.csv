Perkins stands behind President Franklin Roosevelt as he signs the Social Security Act into law on August 14, 1935.  A recent poll found that 63 percent of Americans support a federal minimum wage of $15-an-hour. Despite attacks from conservatives, Social Security is overwhelmingly popular. Most Americans take for granted the idea that employees shouldn't be forced to work more than 8 hours a day without overtime pay and that the government should protect workers from unsafe and unhealthy work places. Surveys show that a majority of Americans believe unions are good for the country. A significant majority of working people support the right of workers to unionize. Once considered radical, these ideas are now considered common sense. And noone was more instrumental in shaping these laws than Frances Perkins, a progressive activist who became President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor. Perkins, who died 50 years ago this month, is one of our nation's greatest heroines. Her remarkable life should inspire us to continue the battles she fought. Many of the issues she worked on -- including wage theft, discrimination against women workers and the rights of immigrant workers -- remain problems today. Anyone who fights for social justice stands on her shoulders.Born in 1880, Perkins grew up in a comfortable middle-class Republican family in Worcester, Massachusetts. At Mount Holyoke College, she was deeply influenced by an economic history course that required her to visit factories in the nearby industrial city of Holyoke and interview workers about their working conditions. She was also affected by reading How the Other Half Lives, Jacob Riis's exposé of New York's slums. In February 1902, during her senior year, Perkins attended a campus talk by Florence Kelley, head of the National Consumers League. Perkins was impressed by Kelley's fiery speech, her combination of radicalism and pragmatism, and her nonconformist lifestyle as a divorced woman with three children working to save the world. Eventually, Kelley, who also came from a middle-class Republican family, became Perkins's role model and mentor.After graduation, Perkins took a series of teaching positions in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Chicago. In her spare time, she volunteered at settlement houses in each city, including Hull House. One of her duties was to try to collect wages for workers who had been cheated by their employers, a responsibility that took her into the homes of the city's poorest residents. In Chicago, she gained more firsthand exposure to dangerous factory conditions and slum housing.In 1907, she took a $50-a-month job with the Philadelphia Research and Protection Association, a Progressive Era reform group. Backed by church and philanthropic groups, the group helped immigrant white girls from Europe and African-American girls from southern states who were then arriving in Philadelphia in great numbers, hoping to find work, but often preyed upon or robbed. Perkins exposed the exploitation of young immigrant and African American women by bogus employment agencies that promised good jobs but lured them into prostitution. She applied for jobs herself to uncover the agencies' practices. She visited fleabag lodging houses and terrible factories, supplying information to the press and city officials.Perkins moved to New York in 1909 to study at Columbia University. The city was bursting with protest and with a growing progressive movement that included union activists, clergy, muckraking journalists, socialists and even upper-class women (including the wives of some of New York's wealthiest men), feminists who cared about the problems of working women. After earning her master's degree in economics and sociology in 1910, Perkins spent the next two years as head of the New York Consumers League. In that capacity, she conducted studies of unsafe and unsanitary workplaces, such as cellar bakeries, that exploited women and children, forcing them to work in dangerous conditions. She became an expert in workplace dangers and firetraps. Collaborating closely with Kelley, she lobbied the state legislature for a bill limiting the workweek for women and children to 54 hours. She also became active in the women's suffrage movement, marching in suffrage parades and giving street-corner speeches.On March 25, 1911, Perkins was having afternoon tea with her friend Margaret Morgan Norrie, a wealthy New Yorker descended from two signatories to the Declaration of Independence. They met at Norrie's elegant redbrick townhouse overlooking Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. But their conversation was interrupted by the sound of fire engine bells. A big fire had erupted on the other side of the square. From the townhouse, they could see flames engulfing the top floors of a ten-story building. Holding up her long skirt, the 30-year-old Perkins ran to the fire scene and realized that the building housed the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, one of the city's largest garment factories, which employed immigrant girls in miserable, overcrowded conditions.Perkins saw workers huddled on the top floors unable to escape because the exit doors had been locked and there were no fire escapes. She saw other workers hanging from the windows by their hands, clinging desperately. She noticed that the city fire trucks' ladders could not reach the top floors, and she witnessed the awful sight of workers jumping or falling to their deaths from the eighth and ninth floors. In total, 146 workers, most of them young immigrant women, died in the Triangle Fire. The experience of witnessing that tragedy, Perkins later explained, ""seared on my mind as well as my heart -- a never-to-be-forgotten reminder of why I had to spend my life fighting conditions that could permit such a tragedy.""Following the Triangle Fire, and in response to the outcry, New York Governor John Alden Dix created the Factory Investigating Commission, a pioneering body with broad subpoena powers and teams of investigators. Its leaders, legislators Robert F. Wagner and Al Smith, asked Perkins to lead the investigation of mercantile shops. As Perkins recalled:We used to make it our business to take Al Smith, the East Side boy, to see the women, thousands of them, coming off the ten-hour night shift on the rope walks in Auburn. Perkins recognized the importance of employees having their own organizations to advance workers rights. She also understood the necessity of forging coalitions to push for progressive legislation. Many of Perkins's upper-class friends provided financial and political support for the causes she worked on. She also forged friendships with politicians, even those she disagreed with, because she knew they could someday be helpful in passing reform legislation.One of those politicians was Smith, the state assemblyman who surprised many New Yorkers by successfully pushing for factory reforms after the Triangle Fire. After he was elected governor in 1918, Smith appointed Perkins to the State Industrial Commission and named her its chair in 1926. Three years later, Franklin Roosevelt (who served as New York governor from 1929-1932), named her the state's industrial commissioner. In that capacity, she visited the United Kingdom to see if that country's unemployment insurance and old-age assistance laws could be adopted in the United States. She expanded factory investigations, reduced the work week for women to forty-eight hours, and championed state minimum wage and unemployment insurance laws.    Perkins stands next to a fire escape as part of her investigation of working conditions for the NY Factory Investigating Commission in around 1912, following the Triangle Fire. As Secretary of Labor in 1940, Perkins descends into a mine shaft in Missouri to investigate working conditions. Perkins with Eleanor Roosevelt in 1961 at the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Triangle Fire.  After FDR's victory in the 1932 presidential election, many progressives, including his wife Eleanor and Jane Addams, urged him to appoint Perkins his Secretary of Labor, but many Americans doubted that a woman could handle such a demanding job. Even Al Smith, her former boss and admirer, remarked that ""men will take advice from a woman, but it is hard for them to take orders from a woman."" The first woman appointed to the Cabinet, proved her opponents wrong. She served as Secretary of Labor from 1933 to 1945. She and Interior Secretary Harold Ickes were the only original members of FDR's cabinet to serve for his entire presidency.Perkins drew on New York State's experience as the model for new federal programs. She was determined to create a safety net for a Depression-scarred society and to use the government's power to create jobs for the jobless. She helped secure a remarkable array of benefits for American workers, including jobs program (the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Public Works Administration and its successor the Federal Works Agency, and the National Industrial Recovery Act).Within FDR's inner circle, she was the strongest proponent of the landmark National Labor Relations Act, sponsored by Senator Robert Wagner (the same politician she had worked with after the Triangle Fire). Passed in 1935, it gave workers the right to unionize. She led the fight for the 1935 Social Security Act, which established unemployment benefits, pensions for elderly Americans and financial aid for the poorest Americans. She was also the prime mover within the Cabinet for the Fair Labor Standards Act, passed in 1938, which created a federal minimum wage, established a 40-hour work week, guaranteed time-and-a-half for overtime in certain jobs and prohibited most employment of minors in ""oppressive child labor.""Perkins excelled at the ""inside/outside"" game. She was one of a handful of FDR's close inner circle advisers with regular access to the president. FDR trusted Perkins's political judgment and her lobbying skills. She was effective at out-maneuvering and out-arguing some of the president's more conservative advisers. She was also adept at working with labor and consumer groups, advising them on which Congress members to lobby, what arguments to make, and when to resort to protest and rallies to draw attention to issues and help push legislation over the finish line.Perkins consistently supported workers' right to organize unions and to pressure employers. For example, in May 1934 about 130,000 San Francisco workers -- printers, streetcar operators, bakery-wagon drivers and others -- stayed home from work to show their solidarity with the city's longshoremen's union, led by Harry Bridges, who were on strike against the big shipping companies. The city's business leaders, as well as state and city officials, implored Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who was standing in for FDR while the president was out of the country, to mobilize federal troops to quell the general strike. Hull agreed with them. FDR's attorney general, Homer Cummings, told Perkins that a general strike was tantamount to an attempt to overthrow the government. The unflappable Perkins rushed to a naval communications facility to get a message to FDR before he heard from Hull or Cummings. He not only sided with Perkins -- saying the strike should be settled through negotiations, not military force -- but he also made it clear to the other cabinet members that she was in charge of handling the crisis. As Perkins predicted, the workers returned to work within two days, the employers and the union negotiated their differences, and the workers won better wages, working conditions, and a union-sponsored hiring hall.As Perkins said, ""I have come to the conclusion that the Department of Labor should be the Department for Labor, and that we should render service to working people.""During the Depression, 6.5 million people were 65 or over. Few had money set aside for old age. Many who had put away a nest egg for retirement saw it disappear when the economy crashed. Only about 300,000 Americans had public pensions, 150,000 had pensions from private employers or unions, and 700,000 had federal relief. The rest were on their own.Among FDR's closest advisors, Perkins was the major advocate for unemployment insurance and Social Security. A year into FDR's presidency, Perkins made her move. As Kirstin Downey describes in her biography of Perkins, The Woman Behind the New Deal: ""She nagged the president to get it started. 'It is probably our only chance in twenty-five years to get a bill like this,' she told Roosevelt."" She knew that the dire conditions of the Great Depression were the only hope for passing something so radical: ""Nothing else would have bumped the American people into social security except something so shocking, so terrifying, as that depression,"" Perkins later said.FDR named Perkins chair of the Committee on Economic Security, established to investigate social insurance and report on its findings in six months. The report recommended that the country adopt programs for unemployment insurance and old-age insurance. Downey explained:""In a meeting with Roosevelt present, she went around the table and extracted from each of the major members of her committee a pledge to support the program being prepared by the committee. Publicly obligated, they could not back down later."" Frances later called committee leaders to her home, ""led them into the dining room, placed a large bottle of Scotch on the table, and told them no one would leave until the work was done,"" according to Downey. With Perkins at the helm, they crafted a bill. She smartly tied together several key ideas. Unemployment insurance would tide over the jobless workers who were the primary source of support to children. Social Security would provide old people with pensions so they could retire without falling into desperate poverty. She also included financial assistance for the handicapped (which today is called disability insurance) and for widowed women with children, because many women earned so little money that when their husbands died they often had to put their children to work or put them in orphanages. But then the president got cold feet, pressured by conservatives within his Cabinet and Congress, and decided it would have to wait. As Downey explained: ""Perkins hit the roof. 'That man, that man!' she muttered. She ripped over to the White House. The next day, FDR told the press conference that he was 'tremendously' for the bill."" FDR explained that his plan would provide ""security against the hazards and vicissitudes of life."" But conservatives and business lobby groups, and many newspaper editorial writers, continued to oppose the bill. A March 30, 1935 headline in the New York Times declared ""Hopes Are Fading for Security Bill."" But Perkins would not give up. She recruited 50 prominent people to sign a letter urging Congress to pass the bill. With unions and other progressive groups weighing in, too, the House, and then the Senate, passed the bill. FDR signed the bill into law on August 14, 1935. Perkins said it was ""one of the most forward-looking pieces of legislation in the interest of wage earners."" Not surprisingly, Perkins became a target of business and conservative groups, who hated public works and social net programs, the minimum wage, and, more than anything, labor unions. One of their staunchest allies in Congress, Martin Dies, headed the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which accused Perkins of supporting communists. She had refused to support efforts to deport Bridges, the West Coast longshoremen's union leader, whom the shipping industry detested. Another right-wing Congressman, J. Parnell Thomas, introduced a motion to impeach her. Her opponents resorted to various lies and dirty tricks, accusing her of having an affair with Bridges, of being a lesbian, and of being born a Russian Jew. FDR refused to fire Perkins, although he did little to defend her from the right-wing attacks. Eventually, HUAC unanimously concluded that the impeachment charges were not warranted. Even so, 10 Republicans issued a minority report saying she should be censured.After FDR died in 1945, Perkins resigned from her position as labor secretary to head the U.S. delegation to the International Labor Organization conference in Paris. President Harry S. Truman subsequently appointed her to the Civil Service Commission, a job she held through 1953. In the last years of her life, she taught at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. In 1962, at the age of 80 she gave a memorable speech to the employees of the Social Security Administration on ""The Roots of Social Security,"" which is still worth reading. The headquarters of the United States Department of Labor in Washington, D.C. is called the Frances Perkins Building. But it is likely that many people who pass by that edifice have no idea who Perkins was.

FDR signed the bill into law on August 14, 1935. Perkins said it was ""one of the most forward-looking pieces of legislation in the interest of wage earners."" Not surprisingly, Perkins became a target of business and conservative groups, who hated public works and social net programs, the minimum wage, and, more than anything, labor unions. One of their staunchest allies in Congress, Martin Dies, headed the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which accused Perkins of supporting communists. She had refused to support efforts to deport Bridges, the West Coast longshoremen's union leader, whom the shipping industry detested. Another right-wing Congressman, J. Parnell Thomas, introduced a motion to impeach her. Her opponents resorted to various lies and dirty tricks, accusing her of having an affair with Bridges, of being a lesbian, and of being born a Russian Jew. FDR refused to fire Perkins, although he did little to defend her from the right-wing attacks. Eventually, HUAC unanimously concluded that the impeachment charges were not warranted. Even so, 10 Republicans issued a minority report saying she should be censured.After FDR died in 1945, Perkins resigned from her position as labor secretary to head the U.S. delegation to the International Labor Organization conference in Paris. President Harry S. Truman subsequently appointed her to the Civil Service Commission, a job she held through 1953. In the last years of her life, she taught at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. In 1962, at the age of 80 she gave a memorable speech to the employees of the Social Security Administration on ""The Roots of Social Security,"" which is still worth reading. The headquarters of the United States Department of Labor in Washington, D.C. is called the Frances Perkins Building.

Perkins stands behind President Franklin Roosevelt as he signs the Social Security Act into law on August 14, 1935.  A recent poll found that 63 percent of Americans support a federal minimum wage of $15-an-hour. Despite attacks from conservatives, Social Security is overwhelmingly popular. Most Americans take for granted the idea that employees shouldn't be forced to work more than 8 hours a day without overtime pay and that the government should protect workers from unsafe and unhealthy work places. Surveys show that a majority of Americans believe unions are good for the country. A significant majority of working people support the right of workers to unionize. Once considered radical, these ideas are now considered common sense. And noone was more instrumental in shaping these laws than Frances Perkins, a progressive activist who became President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor. Perkins, who died 50 years ago this month, is one of our nation's greatest heroines. Her remarkable life should inspire us to continue the battles she fought. Many of the issues she worked on -- including wage theft, discrimination against women workers and the rights of immigrant workers -- remain problems today. Anyone who fights for social justice stands on her shoulders.Born in 1880, Perkins grew up in a comfortable middle-class Republican family in Worcester, Massachusetts. At Mount Holyoke College, she was deeply influenced by an economic history course that required her to visit factories in the nearby industrial city of Holyoke and interview workers about their working conditions. She was also affected by reading How the Other Half Lives, Jacob Riis's exposé of New York's slums. In February 1902, during her senior year, Perkins attended a campus talk by Florence Kelley, head of the National Consumers League. Perkins was impressed by Kelley's fiery speech, her combination of radicalism and pragmatism, and her nonconformist lifestyle as a divorced woman with three children working to save the world. Eventually, Kelley, who also came from a middle-class Republican family, became Perkins's role model and mentor.After graduation, Perkins took a series of teaching positions in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Chicago. In her spare time, she volunteered at settlement houses in each city, including Hull House. One of her duties was to try to collect wages for workers who had been cheated by their employers, a responsibility that took her into the homes of the city's poorest residents. In Chicago, she gained more firsthand exposure to dangerous factory conditions and slum housing.In 1907, she took a $50-a-month job with the Philadelphia Research and Protection Association, a Progressive Era reform group. Backed by church and philanthropic groups, the group helped immigrant white girls from Europe and African-American girls from southern states who were then arriving in Philadelphia in great numbers, hoping to find work, but often preyed upon or robbed. Perkins exposed the exploitation of young immigrant and African American women by bogus employment agencies that promised good jobs but lured them into prostitution. She applied for jobs herself to uncover the agencies' practices. She visited fleabag lodging houses and terrible factories, supplying information to the press and city officials.Perkins moved to New York in 1909 to study at Columbia University. The city was bursting with protest and with a growing progressive movement that included union activists, clergy, muckraking journalists, socialists and even upper-class women (including the wives of some of New York's wealthiest men), feminists who cared about the problems of working women. After earning her master's degree in economics and sociology in 1910, Perkins spent the next two years as head of the New York Consumers League. In that capacity, she conducted studies of unsafe and unsanitary workplaces, such as cellar bakeries, that exploited women and children, forcing them to work in dangerous conditions. She became an expert in workplace dangers and firetraps. Collaborating closely with Kelley, she lobbied the state legislature for a bill limiting the workweek for women and children to 54 hours. She also became active in the women's suffrage movement, marching in suffrage parades and giving street-corner speeches.On March 25, 1911, Perkins was having afternoon tea with her friend Margaret Morgan Norrie, a wealthy New Yorker descended from two signatories to the Declaration of Independence. They met at Norrie's elegant redbrick townhouse overlooking Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. But their conversation was interrupted by the sound of fire engine bells. A big fire had erupted on the other side of the square. From the townhouse, they could see flames engulfing the top floors of a ten-story building. Holding up her long skirt, the 30-year-old Perkins ran to the fire scene and realized that the building housed the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, one of the city's largest garment factories, which employed immigrant girls in miserable, overcrowded conditions.Perkins saw workers huddled on the top floors unable to escape because the exit doors had been locked and there were no fire escapes. She saw other workers hanging from the windows by their hands, clinging desperately. She noticed that the city fire trucks' ladders could not reach the top floors, and she witnessed the awful sight of workers jumping or falling to their deaths from the eighth and ninth floors. In total, 146 workers, most of them young immigrant women, died in the Triangle Fire. The experience of witnessing that tragedy, Perkins later explained, ""seared on my mind as well as my heart -- a never-to-be-forgotten reminder of why I had to spend my life fighting conditions that could permit such a tragedy.""Following the Triangle Fire, and in response to the outcry, New York Governor John Alden Dix created the Factory Investigating Commission, a pioneering body with broad subpoena powers and teams of investigators. Its leaders, legislators Robert F. Wagner and Al Smith, asked Perkins to lead the investigation of mercantile shops. As Perkins recalled:We used to make it our business to take Al Smith, the East Side boy, to see the women, thousands of them, coming off the ten-hour night shift on the rope walks in Auburn. Perkins recognized the importance of employees having their own organizations to advance workers rights. She also understood the necessity of forging coalitions to push for progressive legislation. Many of Perkins's upper-class friends provided financial and political support for the causes she worked on. She also forged friendships with politicians, even those she disagreed with, because she knew they could someday be helpful in passing reform legislation.One of those politicians was Smith, the state assemblyman who surprised many New Yorkers by successfully pushing for factory reforms after the Triangle Fire. After he was elected governor in 1918, Smith appointed Perkins to the State Industrial Commission and named her its chair in 1926. Three years later, Franklin Roosevelt (who served as New York governor from 1929-1932), named her the state's industrial commissioner. In that capacity, she visited the United Kingdom to see if that country's unemployment insurance and old-age assistance laws could be adopted in the United States. She expanded factory investigations, reduced the work week for women to forty-eight hours, and championed state minimum wage and unemployment insurance laws.    Perkins stands next to a fire escape as part of her investigation of working conditions for the NY Factory Investigating Commission in around 1912, following the Triangle Fire. As Secretary of Labor in 1940, Perkins descends into a mine shaft in Missouri to investigate working conditions. Perkins with Eleanor Roosevelt in 1961 at the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Triangle Fire.  After FDR's victory in the 1932 presidential election, many progressives, including his wife Eleanor and Jane Addams, urged him to appoint Perkins his Secretary of Labor, but many Americans doubted that a woman could handle such a demanding job. Even Al Smith, her former boss and admirer, remarked that ""men will take advice from a woman, but it is hard for them to take orders from a woman."" The first woman appointed to the Cabinet, proved her opponents wrong. She served as Secretary of Labor from 1933 to 1945. She and Interior Secretary Harold Ickes were the only original members of FDR's cabinet to serve for his entire presidency.Perkins drew on New York State's experience as the model for new federal programs. She was determined to create a safety net for a Depression-scarred society and to use the government's power to create jobs for the jobless. She helped secure a remarkable array of benefits for American workers, including jobs program (the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Public Works Administration and its successor the Federal Works Agency, and the National Industrial Recovery Act).Within FDR's inner circle, she was the strongest proponent of the landmark National Labor Relations Act, sponsored by Senator Robert Wagner (the same politician she had worked with after the Triangle Fire). Passed in 1935, it gave workers the right to unionize. She led the fight for the 1935 Social Security Act, which established unemployment benefits, pensions for elderly Americans and financial aid for the poorest Americans. She was also the prime mover within the Cabinet for the Fair Labor Standards Act, passed in 1938, which created a federal minimum wage, established a 40-hour work week, guaranteed time-and-a-half for overtime in certain jobs and prohibited most employment of minors in ""oppressive child labor.""Perkins excelled at the ""inside/outside"" game. She was one of a handful of FDR's close inner circle advisers with regular access to the president. FDR trusted Perkins's political judgment and her lobbying skills. She was effective at out-maneuvering and out-arguing some of the president's more conservative advisers. She was also adept at working with labor and consumer groups, advising them on which Congress members to lobby, what arguments to make, and when to resort to protest and rallies to draw attention to issues and help push legislation over the finish line.Perkins consistently supported workers' right to organize unions and to pressure employers. For example, in May 1934 about 130,000 San Francisco workers -- printers, streetcar operators, bakery-wagon drivers and others -- stayed home from work to show their solidarity with the city's longshoremen's union, led by Harry Bridges, who were on strike against the big shipping companies. The city's business leaders, as well as state and city officials, implored Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who was standing in for FDR while the president was out of the country, to mobilize federal troops to quell the general strike. Hull agreed with them. FDR's attorney general, Homer Cummings, told Perkins that a general strike was tantamount to an attempt to overthrow the government. The unflappable Perkins rushed to a naval communications facility to get a message to FDR before he heard from Hull or Cummings. He not only sided with Perkins -- saying the strike should be settled through negotiations, not military force -- but he also made it clear to the other cabinet members that she was in charge of handling the crisis. As Perkins predicted, the workers returned to work within two days, the employers and the union negotiated their differences, and the workers won better wages, working conditions, and a union-sponsored hiring hall.As Perkins said, ""I have come to the conclusion that the Department of Labor should be the Department for Labor, and that we should render service to working people.""During the Depression, 6.5 million people were 65 or over. Few had money set aside for old age. Many who had put away a nest egg for retirement saw it disappear when the economy crashed. Only about 300,000 Americans had public pensions, 150,000 had pensions from private employers or unions, and 700,000 had federal relief. The rest were on their own.Among FDR's closest advisors, Perkins was the major advocate for unemployment insurance and Social Security. A year into FDR's presidency, Perkins made her move. As Kirstin Downey describes in her biography of Perkins, The Woman Behind the New Deal: ""She nagged the president to get it started. 'It is probably our only chance in twenty-five years to get a bill like this,' she told Roosevelt."" She knew that the dire conditions of the Great Depression were the only hope for passing something so radical: ""Nothing else would have bumped the American people into social security except something so shocking, so terrifying, as that depression,"" Perkins later said.FDR named Perkins chair of the Committee on Economic Security, established to investigate social insurance and report on its findings in six months. The report recommended that the country adopt programs for unemployment insurance and old-age insurance. Downey explained:""In a meeting with Roosevelt present, she went around the table and extracted from each of the major members of her committee a pledge to support the program being prepared by the committee. Publicly obligated, they could not back down later."" Frances later called committee leaders to her home, ""led them into the dining room, placed a large bottle of Scotch on the table, and told them no one would leave until the work was done,"" according to Downey. With Perkins at the helm, they crafted a bill. She smartly tied together several key ideas. Unemployment insurance would tide over the jobless workers who were the primary source of support to children. Social Security would provide old people with pensions so they could retire without falling into desperate poverty. She also included financial assistance for the handicapped (which today is called disability insurance) and for widowed women with children, because many women earned so little money that when their husbands died they often had to put their children to work or put them in orphanages. But then the president got cold feet, pressured by conservatives within his Cabinet and Congress, and decided it would have to wait. As Downey explained: ""Perkins hit the roof. 'That man, that man!' she muttered. She ripped over to the White House. The next day, FDR told the press conference that he was 'tremendously' for the bill."" FDR explained that his plan would provide ""security against the hazards and vicissitudes of life."" But conservatives and business lobby groups, and many newspaper editorial writers, continued to oppose the bill. A March 30, 1935 headline in the New York Times declared ""Hopes Are Fading for Security Bill."" But Perkins would not give up. She recruited 50 prominent people to sign a letter urging Congress to pass the bill. With unions and other progressive groups weighing in, too, the House, and then the Senate, passed the bill. FDR signed the bill into law on August 14, 1935. Perkins said it was ""one of the most forward-looking pieces of legislation in the interest of wage earners.""

One on hand, many wonder if it's possible to argue for gender equality while hobbling around on six-inch heels. On the other: How is what women wear relevant at all?In recent months, the debate seems to have risen to new heights, so to speak. Two of the day's more popular, and profitable, fashion trends--""athleisure,"" which includes high end, but ultimately casual, pieces like designer sweatpants and track-suit-inspired jackets, and ""normcore,"" which is characterized by relatively bland, ""average-looking"" clothing -- emphasize comfort. Sneakers and other flat shoes feature prominently. For perhaps the first time in a long while, tennis shoes are entirely, or at least mostly, appropriate work wear.And yet, high heels are still an expected part of a black tie get-up -- or so it seems. The idea was the source of much tension recently when, at the Cannes Film Festival, festival director Thierry Fremaux apparently insisted that women who walked the red carpet adhere to a strict, ""formal"" dress code -- heels included. Predictably, the edict drew the ire of more than a few women who attended. ""Everyone should wear flats, to be honest. We shouldn't wear high heels anyway,"" said actress Emily Blunt. ""That's just my point of view. I prefer to wear Converse sneakers."" Others agreed, and eventually Fremaux was forced to apologize.But it's likely that these women were reacting less to the idea of the misogyny of high heels than to the misogyny of being told to wear them. Sure, women may be growing tired of paying $1,500 for shoes that give them blisters, but they're even more tired of being expected to conform to standards of beauty, and especially ones issued by men. Given the still prevalent imbalance of power and worth in the workplace, it's easy to see why.And yet, there are plenty of reasons -- that are neither oppressive nor anti-feminist -- to wear high heels, other than that the male patriarchy dictates it. Besides the fact that we issue, and adhere to, dress codes all the time without claiming anti-feminism, science now confirms that heels give women certain advantages. A recent study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior confirmed that high heels increase a woman's attractiveness -- and, as a result, give women an undeniable power over men. Which begs the question: Why shouldn't women use what they can to get what still appears to be a much-needed edge?The answer, of course, is that they should. Rallying against gender inequality doesn't mean abandoning the desire to look a certain way, whether that certain way makes you feel better about yourself, or makes you smile when you look in the mirror or gives you an advantage over the opposite gender. Many women like how they look in heels. They shouldn't be made to feel as if they're abandoning the feminist cause, or kowtowing to the patriarchy if they choose to wear them.Although Fremaux eventually apologized, the misogyny -- if that's even what it was -- wasn't all his. The fact is that, whether a woman buys in to Fremaux's dress code or holds it up as a model of the persistent patriarchy -- whether we insist women wear heels or insist they don't -- we're still trying to dictate what women do or don't spend their money on, what they do or don't think makes them look or feel better. In doing so, we discount entirely a woman's personal preference. We assume that most women would make the same choice. How about the right all women have to wear what they want to wear, without judgment or qualification?It's possible to want to wear high heels and also want equality in the workplace at the same time. Women who want both aren't hypocrites. They're women who like gender equality -- and high heels."

Details of the nationalities of the victims and how they died have not yet been released.The bodies and more than 200 survivors will be brought to the port of Augusta in eastern Sicily aboard the Italian navy corvette Fenice later on Saturday, the coastguard said.Migrants escaping war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East this year have been pouring into Italy, which has been bearing the brunt of Mediterranean rescue operations. Most depart from the coast of Libya, which has descended into anarchy since Western powers backed a 2011 revolt that ousted Muammar Gaddafi.Calm seas are increasingly favoring departures as warm spring weather sets in. Last month around 800 migrants drowned off Libya in the Mediterranean's most deadly shipwreck in living memory when their 20-meter long fishing boat capsized and sank.That spurred the European Union to agree on a naval mission to target gangs smuggling migrants from Libya, but a broader plan to deal with the influx is in doubt due to a dispute over national quotas for housing asylum seekers.The EU plan to disperse 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece to other countries met with resistance this week, with Britain saying it would not participate and some eastern countries calling for a voluntary scheme.Around 35,500 migrants arrived in Italy from the beginning of the year up to the first week of May, the UN refugee agency estimated, a number which has swelled considerably since. About 1,800 are either dead or missing.Most of those rescued on Friday and Saturday are expected to reach ports around southern Italy during the weekend. The British naval vessel HMS Bulwark offloaded more than 740 early on Saturday at the southeastern Italian port of Taranto.More than 200 migrants arrived at the Calabrian port of Crotone in south-west Italy on board the Belgian navy ship Godetia.

You and your family can swim, surf, sail, snorkel, and fish together by day. Then, come nightfall, in season, you can watch marine turtles emerge from the ocean, a magical experience your grandkids will remember for the rest of their lives. 2. Chiang Mai, ThailandChiang Mai is a top affordable retirement option in Asia and a great choice if you and your grandchildren are animal lovers. When your family comes to visit, take them to Patara Elephant Park, where they can learn to feed and bathe the elephants, and to Chiang Mai's national parks to spot the monkeys. In April, the grandkids can visit to be part of the biggest water fight in the world, the annual Thai New Year festival, Songkran. The water is symbolic of cleansing and be warned -- no one is safe!Retired in Chiang Mai, your grandchildren would be welcome everywhere. Thais are famous for their love of children.3. Cuenca, EcuadorEcuador's borders contain some of the most awe-inspiring natural landscapes on the planet, including cloud forests in the Andes and one of the world's most important eco-systems, the Galapagos Islands. A trip to this eco-paradise is an adventure and a unique learning experience rolled in to one, a chance to introduce your grandkids to giant tortoises, friendly penguins, and enormous dragon-like lizards. 4. Las Terrenas, Dominican RepublicEveryone dreams of escaping to a Caribbean island. Retire to one, and your family's white-sand dreams can come true. Las Terrenas is everything you want in a Caribbean beach town, plus unexpected delights like authentic French bakeries and fine-dining choices. Those things might not get your grandkids' attention, but ever-present chances for swimming, snorkeling, boogie boarding, and soccer on the beach should. Las Terrenas is also home to a top-notch but low-key and kid-friendly surf school.5. Paris, FranceParis is the world's most romantic and most beautiful city, a retirement dream for many. The City of Light, though, also has a lot to offer the younger set. In addition to Euro Disney and Parc Asterix, there's the aquarium de Paris, Cinéaqua, which combines a traditional aquarium with the magic of cinema. Children will love seeing sharks up close in the shark tunnel and stroking the friendly sturgeons in the petting pool.Puppet shows and pony rides are de rigueur at Paris' famous Luxembourg Gardens, and at the enormous Bois de Vincennes you can hire a rowboat, visit a medieval castle, or spend an afternoon at the petting zoo. Every summer, Parc des Tuilleries is given over to the annual summer fair, with rides, games, and other carnival attractions.6. Vilanova, SpainThe Catalan town of Vilanova, less than an hour from Barcelona, has managed to avoid the spotlight but is an appealing option for a relaxed and authentically Spanish retirement lifestyle. It's also a perfect vacation spot for children. The fascinating Museu-biblioteca Victor Balaguer has collections of Roman and Egyptian artifacts (including the mummy of a small girl), and the town's long central promenade is a great spot for easy bike rides. The beach is safe for swimming, with no rocks or waves and a very gentle incline, and an amusement park, Port Aventura, and water park are just a short drive away.Plus, Barcelona is just a quick train ride away, and trains depart between the two towns four times an hour.7. Mendoza, ArgentinaArgentina is a romantic option for the retiree who loves wine, steak, and tango, but this beautiful region of this energetic South American country is also a great base for grandparents hoping to attraction their grandkids for active vacations. Horse-riding adventures provide great insights into the colorful gaucho culture, and what fun to participate with your grandkids in the annual grape harvest festivities.8. Cayo BelizeSunny Belize is a little country offering great diversity that translates into a number of different and appealing retirement lifestyle choices that double as great holidays. On Ambergris Caye, you and your grandkids could enjoy the best of life alongside the Caribbean Sea. In Belize's interior Cayo District, you'd have the rain forest on your doorstep, plus rivers for canoeing and tubing, caves for exploring, and Mayan ruins for climbing. The best news is that, because Belize is such a small country, you could base yourself in either location and enjoy regular, even daily if you wanted, excursions to the other. In-country flights mean the Cayo and Ambergris are but a half-hour apart.9. Caribbean Coast of MexicoMexico's Caribbean coast is a great choice for a relaxed, affordable seaside retirement. In addition, its Xcaret Conservation Park is a place for you and your grandkids to get cheek to cheek to with dolphins, snorkel along an underground river, and practice your moves with a local dance troupe. In addition to all the sea life, this region of Mexico is rich with Mayan history. The 600 stone building ruins of Chichen Itza are considered one of the ""new seven wonders of the world"" and an excellent chance to study the Mayans' grasp of architecture, astronomy, technology, and art.Featured Destination: Dominican RepublicRelated Articles:5 Critical Steps For Moving To A New CountryMom Starts New Life In Las Terrenas, Dominican RepublicRetirement Overseas Is Cheaper Than You Might ThinkEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

13,HEALTHY LIVING,Need to Curb Carb Cravings? Try Cutting the Coffee,"Dr. Veronica Anderson, ContributorMedical Doctor, Medical Intuitive, Homeopath, Wellness Coach.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/need-to-curb-carb-craving_b_7258728.html,,2015-05-29,2015-05-11-1431366655-8044370-bigstockCoffee83140160.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-11-1431366655-8044370-bigstockCoffee83140160-thumb.jpg,"If you find it easy to eat a healthy, balanced meal for breakfast, but carb cravings take over by dinner, research suggests your daily coffee habit may be to blame. While the thought of giving up your morning cup of coffee may seem daunting now, hopefully this article will shed light on the impact that caffeine in coffee is having on your adrenal glands and how that impact increases your cravings for carb-rich foods.Understanding Your Adrenal GlandsYour adrenal glands are small, yet powerful organs positioned atop each kidney. When you encounter a stressful situation, your adrenal glands release potent hormones like cortisol and adrenaline that put your body on high alert and prepare it for fight or flight. Unfortunately for coffee lovers, the caffeine in coffee stimulates the adrenal glands in the same way that a stressful situation does. That means with each cup of coffee you consume, your body is getting ready for a fight that never comes. Over time, triggering the fight or flight response can lead to adrenal fatigue, particularly in women, which means your adrenal glands function below optimum level.Researchers discovered evidence of this change in adrenal functioning during a 2005 study published in Psychosomatic Medicine. Healthy women and men who consumed caffeine on a daily basis throughout the study experienced significantly lower cortisol levels than those who consumed caffeine occasionally. While those results might lead you to conclude that coffee drinkers develop a tolerance to caffeine, researchers say it shows they actually weaken their adrenal glands' ability to respond to caffeine and secrete the proper level of hormones.Coming Down From an Adrenaline HighWhen your adrenal glands are functioning properly and responding normally to caffeine stimulation, they release adrenaline that temporarily gives you a boost of energy. Once your body comes down from the adrenaline high, you are more likely to experience undesirable symptoms like fatigue, irritability, and even headaches. Those symptoms often prompt a craving for more caffeine, which in turn comes with a new craving for sugar. By lunch, you find yourself craving things like pizza, cookies, and more caffeinated beverages to counteract the fatigue and moodiness. If you give in to that lunchtime craving, a few hours later you will crash again and repeat the cycle at dinner.Getting Off the Caffeine-Carb Roller CoasterIf that loop is all too familiar to you, you are likely aware that stopping cold turkey is extremely difficult -- even for the strongest of wills. You have to reset your adrenal and insulin functions before you can hope to successfully reduce both your caffeine and carb cravings. There are many ways you can naturally heal your adrenal glands and curb your carb cravings at the same time. Research suggests that boosting your intake of vitamin C, magnesium, and vitamin B5 can help treat adrenal fatigue. In their book The Adrenal Fatigue Solution, authors Fawne Hansen and naturopath Dr. Eric Wood also recommend including supplements like Omega-3 (reduces inflammation and the workload on the adrenals), D-Ribose (offers an energy-boosting alternative to caffeine), and the herbal supplement ashwagandha (helps to regulate the body's cortisol levels).Practicing yoga can also help alleviate excess stress, which overtaxes the adrenal glands. Talk to your health care practitioner about ways you can treat adrenal insufficiency and wean yourself from caffeine dependency.How Can You Be Sure Caffeine Is Disrupting Your Adrenal Glands? The best way to tell if caffeine is having a negative impact on your adrenal functioning is to test the cortisol levels in your saliva at four different times throughout the day. The interval testing is necessary because cortisol has a diurnal variation, which means the levels of cortisol in the body fluctuate from high to low throughout the day. Plan B Medicare and certain health insurance plans cover saliva cortisol testing. Talk with your health care practitioner about your caffeine consumption and carb cravings if you think you might benefit from having your cortisol levels tested.Is It Okay to Switch to Tea?When people are looking to transition away from drinking coffee, they often ask if it is okay to drink tea. While it is true that tea has much lower caffeine levels than coffee, I still strongly advise against drinking tea until you eliminate your caffeine craving. Keep in mind that herbal teas have no caffeine.Now that you have all the facts, before you pour your next cup of coffee, ask yourself if you really want to continue putting your health at risk by riding the caffeine-carb roller coaster."

From unattainable beauty standards placed on women to how inaccessible birth control remains to having men debate whether you are good looking enough for TV, it is safe to say that we have found our new feminist best friend.Schumer has built a legion of fans over the past few years, but it is the new season of her show, Inside Amy Schumer, that really has people paying attention. By being unapologetically feminist and using humor to make her message about an otherwise ""heavy"" topic of women's rights funny, Schumer exposes various double-standards women have to experience just because we are women. Her sketch, ""The Last F-ckable Day"" is the perfect example. In it, Amy Schumer stumbles onto feminist comedic icons such as Patricia Arquette, Tina Fey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus nonchalantly having a picnic in the forest, toasting to Dreyfus' ""last f-ckable day,"" which is basically when Hollywood decides middle-aged actresses are no longer sexy, and as a result, roles they're offered go from complex leads to those of mothers or ""Mrs. Claus.""""In every actress's life, the media decides when you finally reach the point where you're not believably f-ckable anymore,"" Dreyfuss matter-of-factly explains to Schumer.""Nobody really overtly tells you, but there are signs,"" an enthusiastic Tina Fey chimes in. ""Like going from girlfriend to mom.""A naive and confused Amy Schumer asks the wiser women what this age is for men to which the women respond in laughter, informing her that there is no last f-ckable day for men, who remain desirable in Hollywood at any age simply because they are men.But behind Schumer's great writing, this segment, like most of Schumer's sketches, is about more than just a few good feminist jokes. Behind her armor of comedy are serious issues that even the ACLU can no longer ignore, which just announced that they are asking state and federal civil rights agencies to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood. What is truly revolutionary and important about Schumer's work, much of which she writes, is that while shattering stereotypes of women, and especially feminists, not being funny, she is also using feminism as the marketing platform for her show. Schumer is setting herself up as not just another celebrity feminist, but as a new feminist Shero.""I say if I'm beautiful,"" Schumer said in her speech at the Ms. Foundation Award ceremony last year. ""I say if I'm strong. You will not determine my story -- I will.""If Schumer continues her momentum, no doubt hers will be a story we will all be watching."

The Galileo spacecraft has captured images, released Wednesday, April 9, 1997, of iceberg-like structures and smooth patches on Europa providing the strongest evidence yet that an ocean _ and perhaps life _ lie beneath its frozen surface.(AP Photo/Jet Propulsion Lab)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14e09260000340070a937.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week we are one step closer to understanding a world in our solar system that I believe has the best chance of supporting life beyond our own planet. NASA has just announced details about what instruments a space probe to Jupiter's moon Europa will carry when it makes multiple flybys in the next decade.I couldn't be more excited to be the project scientist of this mission. I first learned of Europa as a kid who made planets out of tennis balls covered in construction paper and masking tape and hung them from my bedroom ceiling on Long Island. In 1979, the twin Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past Jupiter and its moons. Though not the largest moon of Jupiter, Europa was the most enigmatic: Voyager's pictures showed a maze of dark lines marking the bright icy surface, like a cracked eggshell. From Zócalo Public Square Seeing the first Voyager 2 photos of Europa inspired the famous Carl Sagan to wonder whether the dark bands were mountain-like ridges or valley-like troughs. What do they say about the history of this world? I was fortunate to take Sagan's seminar course at Cornell University in 1985 and was fascinated by the possibility of a watery ocean within Jupiter's moon Europa. It was uncertain whether such an ocean would have frozen solid over time or could persist today. To learn more, NASA sent the Galileo spacecraft past Europa a dozen times while orbiting Jupiter between 1996 and 2002. Galileo images showed Europa's surface to be crisscrossed by both mountain-like ridges and valley-like troughs. The patterns of the ridges and cracks suggest an ocean below that permits the ice shell to flex and break. Giant bulls-eye-like scars tell of large comets that collided with the moon, the impacts penetrating the icy shell to liquid water below. In places, the surface is broken into city-sized chunks that resemble giant ice floes. In addition to its strange geology, Europa shows an unusual magnetic signature. The Galileo spacecraft's magnetic sensors detected a layer beneath Europa's surface that conducts electricity, betraying an underground saltwater ocean. It's that ocean that makes Europa particularly fascinating because of the distinct possibility that there could be life in these lightless waters. We don't expect whales or fish down there, but alien single-celled microorganisms could exist. Other moons at Jupiter -- Ganymede and Callisto -- probably have oceans deep within. Saturn's tiny moon Enceladus spews water into space from geysers. But Europa's ocean provides the best case for life because it is the most likely to have had all three ingredients for life -- water and the elements needed to build organic molecules and chemical energy. Finding life elsewhere would end our cosmic isolation: if there is life in our own planetary backyard, then life is probably common throughout the universe. These enticing possibilities are why my colleagues and I have spent 17 years developing a spacecraft mission dedicated to understanding Europa. We will orbit Jupiter, as Galileo did, but this time, focusing in on Europa with dozens and dozens of very close flybys and instruments designed to divine Europa's history. It will take at least a decade to go from blueprints to getting data back. There's a kid somewhere now, hanging model planets in his bedroom, who will help decipher whether Europa is everything I hope it is.© Zócalo"
16,HEALTHY LIVING,The Keys to Healthy Digestion,"Ornish Living, ContributorFor anyone who is interested in leading a healthful lifestyle",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/digestion_b_7464182.html,,2015-05-29,2015-05-28-1432848036-9636975-guthealthjulienhaler.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-28-1432848036-9636975-guthealthjulienhaler-thumb.jpg,"Switching to a whole-food, plant-based approach to eating is an excellent way to enhance your digestion. It is rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals and health-promoting phytochemicals and avoids hard-to-digest foods such as meat, dairy and food high in fat. You will feel better and can prevent many digestive disorders such as diverticular disease and even certain cancers such as gastrointestinal and colorectal, along with reducing the overall risk of all cancers and chronic diseases such as heart disease.Your digestive system, however, will need some time to adapt. You are now eating more healthy high fiber foods and complex carbohydrates, but they are also more complex to break down, which means your body needs to produce enough digestive enzymes to do the job. After about a week or two, your body will get used to this new way of eating.The Role of Digestive EnzymesDigestive enzymes are an essential part of our ability to absorb the nutrients from the food we eat. This is because food needs to be broken down into smaller components (chemical substances) so it can be absorbed and assimilated. Digestive enzymes break down specific parts of the food such as carbohydrates, protein and fats. This process of digestion and breaking down food into absorbable parts starts in the mouth and ends in the large intestine and colon.What Enzymes Break Down What FoodsEach digestive enzyme has a specific target that aids in proper and efficient digestion. For example, the digestive enzymes that break down protein include proteases such as peptidase, papain and bromelin, along with pepsin. Fats or lipids are broken down by lipases; lactose, or milk sugar from dairy foods, is broken down by lactase; complex carbohydrates such as beans and vegetables are broken down by alpha-galactosidase; and cellulose breaks down parts of cell walls in plant foods such as grains, beans, and certain vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower. Digestive enzymes are primarily produced in the stomach, pancreas and mouth.Why Chewing Your Food Is ImportantAmylase and ptyalin are two of the many enzymes that are released in the mouth that begin the breakdown of carbohydrates (starches and sugars). The digestion of fats begins in the mouth by the release of lipase that is secreted by salivary glands while we chew. This is why chewing your food well is an important part of good digestion. Swallowing after a few short chews doesn't give these digestive enzymes a chance to do their job. As a result, digestion can be impaired from the start, making it harder for your body to digest and absorb these nutrients. Nutrients that are not absorbed can become fermented by the bacteria in our gut, which can produce gas, abdominal discomfort and bloating. Oligosaccharides, found in plant foods such as beans and some produce such such as garlic, onions, broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts, can cause of some gas production; however these complex carbohydrates have been shown to promote a healthy digestive tract and have functional benefits similar to soluble fiber such improved blood sugar control after a meal. Our bodies are designed to naturally produce the appropriate enzymes we need for proper digestion and absorption of nutrients, but this process is not always efficient for a variety of reasons such aging, certain digestive disorders or disease that can affect the digestive tract such as celiac disease and Crohn's disease, pancreatic insufficiency and other factors such as pH balance.How to Stop Gas and BloatingWhen you first make the switch to a plant-based diet, it can also take a while for your body to kick in and produce enough digestive enzymes. This is especially true if you are accustom to eating a low fiber diet of processed foods and you quickly switch to a whole food, plant-based approach, high in fiber and complex carbohydrates. This is why sometimes after eating a high fiber meal of complex carbohydrates such as beans or broccoli, you may experience gas or bloating. After a few weeks, however, this bloating and gas stops as your body becomes more efficient at producing the digestive enzymes that it needs to digest and absorb all the essential nutrients.One approach is to slowly add higher-fiber foods to allow the body to start producing more of the essential enzymes for digestion. Another approach is to support your body with the important digestive enzymes it needs by taking a digestive enzyme supplement. The digestive enzyme alpha-galactosidase can help break down high-fiber foods and reduce gas-related symptoms. Certain digestive enzyme supplements such as Beano contain alpha-galactosidase that aids in the breakdown of these complex carbohydrates. These studies shows the effects of supplementing with alpha-galactosidase such as Beano on reducing gas related symptoms. Here are a couple of the top picks for digestive enzymes that breakdown complex carbohydrates from Consumer Labs, a publisher of test results on health, wellness, and nutrition products:Raw Enzymes by Garden of Life, which includes alpha-galactosidase, cellulose, and other digestive enzymes that support the effective breakdown of complex carbohydrates found in plant foods gets. Consumer Labs gives it a high rating.Solgar Comfort Zone is another Consumer Labs approved product that offers a broader range of digestive enzymes and includes digestive aids such as fennel extract, ginger and anise powder, which may help to reduce gas, bloating or nausea.A Few Tips for Taking Digestive Enzyme Supplements 1. Take with food. You can take just before a meal, but anytime between 20-30 minutes of your meal is beneficial.2. Choose a high quality digestive aid that includes the specific digestive enzymes your body may needs such as alpha-galactosidase, cellulose and amylase for complex carbohydrates or lactose for lactase.3. Stay well-hydrated with adequate water intake depending on your needs. Strive for at least 64 ounces a day as you are increasing your fiber intake.4. Start slowly and notice how your body responds. After a week or two, slowly decrease the intake and allow your body to naturally adjust and produce the necessary enzyme for efficient digestion and absorption.The long-term health promoting benefits of a vegetarian, plant-based approach are tremendous including improved digestive and cardiovascular health, prevention of chronic disease and cancers, decreased inflammation, enhanced immune system, improved blood pressure, blood sugar and weight management; all with an overall heightened sense of well-being and vitality.Within two weeks, digestive discomfort will begin to fade and the positive benefits are amplified with overall improved digestion, more energy, better sleep, and weight loss averaging about 10 pounds.What has been your digestion experience after switching to a whole food, plant based lifestyle approach?This post was originally published on Ornish Living.

You're more likely to find lifelong love by listening to your instincts and sticking with what works.,2015-05-29,"South Africa, Cape Town, Rear view of young couple sitting at beach",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb604c12500003600397a0e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ask him for a date, or let him pursue you? Respond to the text immediately, or let her wait? Tell him you love him, or stay mum until he says it first?The early days of a relationship are thrilling, but also stressful. That heavenly new-love high can feel pretty precarious, as if one false move could unravel the whole thing.So, you plot and plan and strategize -- discussing every move with a panel of your 12 closest friends. In some ways, that's part of the fun, but a new book by Washington Post reporter Ellen McCarthy says it's probably a waste of time.McCarthy was the Post's wedding reporter for four years -- a gig she landed on the very day she and a former boyfriend broke up. McCarthy thought that covering weddings while heartbroken would be torture, but she discovered that it actually inspired her.""All of these people -- young, rich, poor, plain, beautiful, sophisticated, and simple -- they'd all found someone. I was reminded again and again that love happens every day, in all kind of ways, to all kinds of people,"" she writes in her terrific new book, The Real Thing: Lessons on Love and Life from a Wedding Reporter's Notebook.  By investigating real relationships rather than the ones in rom-coms or dating guides, she discovered that a lot of conventional wisdom about romance didn't jibe with her fieldwork.For example, we all love a good origin story, those tales of lovers whom fate brought together through snowstorms or missed trains. But McCarthy says that people who meet in less goosebump-inspiring ways, like online dating, are just as likely to have high-quality relationships.""All of the couples who got together with a little help from technology feel the same sense of fate as couples who met while serving in the Peace Corps mission or while sharing a wall as next-door neighbors,"" writes McCarthy, who estimates that 35 to 40 percent of the couples who apply to be featured in her column met online.McCarthy also discovered that the happiest relationships didn't require obedience to antiquated dating maxims:One of the things I've heard over and over again from couples describing what was different when they met 'the One' was that for the first time, they didn't feel like they were in the middle of a romantic chess match. There was no guessing whether or not the other person was interested. They didn't worry about 'the rules' on how long to wait before calling or setting up the next date. The whole thing felt relaxed and transparent, not fraught with the typical 'Does he or she like me?' anxiety.In fact, McCarthy often stumped college classes when she asked them to guess the most common word she heard when couples described their relationships. It wasn't ""love,"" ""laughter"" or ""chemistry"" -- it was ""comfortable,"" a word 70 to 80 percent of her couples used.The students thought this sounded like a drag, but I think it's great news. ""Comfortable"" doesn't mean you aren't also counting down the seconds until you can see your beloved again. It just means that when you find the right fit, you probably won't have to stress about the precise wording of your latest text -- or spend much time decoding his or hers. If he says he's going to be late because he got stuck in a meeting at work, that means he's going to be late because he got stuck in a meeting at work.In other words, winning someone's heart doesn't require employing a lot of complicated schemes. You're more likely to find lifelong love by listening to your instincts and sticking with what works. That might be bad news for those who earn their living peddling strategies and tricks, but it's great news for everyone else.Sara Eckel is the author of It's Not You: 27 (Wrong) Reasons You're Single.

This time around, she didn't waste any time getting to the issues while addressing the South Carolina Democratic Women's Council at their third annual Day in Blue event. This was the biggest audience Clinton has addressed since announcing her candidacy a little over a month ago in the state that will host the democratic primaries. State Rep. Gilda Cobb set the tone and energy for the day while introducing Clinton by saying:All of us believe that a woman's place is in the House, and in the Senate and, in case there is any doubt, also at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""When Clinton took over the mic, she indicated that she wasn't willing to lose this time around, saying with a grin that she was indeed ""running to live again at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""She quickly got to the topic of women's rights, rallying a crowd of about 200 women beginning with the problem of wage inequality. The cheers began when the candidate said, ""I don't think I'm letting you in on a secret when I say too many women still earn less than men on the job."" She went on to say that this inequality will only build upon itself, becoming a family problem and an American economy problem. In perhaps her most direct response to the issue, she proposed specific ways to combat wage inequality citing her own Paycheck Fairness Act and encouraging education on the issue stating that: ""You can't stand up for equal pay if you don't know whether you're paid equally.""She moved on to address her belief that middle America is falling behind assuring the crowd that she would be a champion for everyday Americans to turn this progress around. The now millionaire put on a very down-to-earth tone describing her own middle class beginnings as the daughter of a small business owner. Instead of dining at one of Columbia's finest restaurants, she chose to meet with local business owners over chicken and waffles. Interestingly enough, the audience heard a slight twang emerge in Clinton's voice as the speech went on. Sticking to the down-home feel of the address, the grandmother expressed her own commitment to strengthening American families mentioning her own daughter and grandchild. She explained that while her family is fortunate to live close enough for her to lend a hand, not everyone has that luxury and advocated for things such as paid leave for mothers. Of course, Clinton was the tough woman with sass we know her to be when addressing her qualifications in the race for the White House saying sarcastically that, ""I do know how hard this job I am seeking is. I have seen it up close and personal.""However, she indicated that she didn't intend to do the job like everyone else that has occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and smiled when she said this about previous presidents:By the time they leave, they're as white as the building they live in.The address was overall a great success for the candidate who had once lost all but two South Carolina counties to Obama in the previous election. She let some of her roots show while promising to be a champion for everyday Americans and, so far, it seems that the women of South Carolina believe her as almost every line of her carefully crafted speech was met with applause, cheers and even a few ""Amens!"""

Today, Russia and the U.S take one more step in their very own modern adaptation of the Cold War in the curious battlefield of international soccer. But are Putin's remarks on the lack of jurisdiction and competence of the U.S over the corruption scandal only a logical step in Russia's traditional policy of rhetoric against America, or do they play a strategic role in Russia's approach to the conflict in Ukraine? In today's globalized and interconnected world everything is possible.When it comes to projecting military power, Russia has it covered, always has and probably always will. But when it comes to friends and sympathy, the towering nation struggles as the Soft Power Survey 2014/2015 demonstrates. Particularly, Putin's leadership has weakened Russia's power to persuade and gain allies through non-military means in the last years, an undeniably relevant resource in the international system. Today, in the face of a growing economic crisis and an increasingly risky position in the Ukraine conflict, Russia takes hold of any available resource to boost up its reputation and reaffirm its confrontational position against the West, even football. Putin on the FIFA scandal cannot be interpreted as an isolated rhetoric speech, not when Ukraine's sovereignty and stability remain at stake and evidence of Russia's involvement in the conflict keeps emerging. In the first place, Putin's stand on the U.S. intervention in the matter is congruent with a larger and broader discourse against the intervention of the U.S -- and the West in general -- in other nations' affairs. This discourse gains particular relevance in the context of the war in Ukraine, where the U.S., the E.U., and NATO currently discuss the possibility of a greater intervention and supplying lethal aid. Rhetoric is taking a whole new dimension, and new actors and platforms such as sports become significant outlets. Second, Putin's stand regarding the FIFA scandal is not only a matter of rhetoric and discourse; it is a matter of leadership projection. For Russia, calling on the U.S., openly exposing its opinion on Joseph Blatter's re-election, and defending its right to host the 2018 World Cup with subtle threats and strong declarations, are part of a greater strategy to project power, leadership, and determination in every possible dimension. In times of direct confrontation with the U.S. and the West, this is a resource that cannot be wasted. Finally, and whether we like it or not, football has become a significant source of soft power in today's world. FIFA and the World Cup have become not only important sources of economic revenue for the host countries, but important platforms to expose the virtues, traditions, culture, and tourist destinations of the lucky nation, elements that aid the construction of a positive reputation and image which directly impact international politics. Russia's strong and controversial position in the matters of football is much more than an extravagant caprice, it is a sign of determination and strong commitment to a congruent narrative and discourse that guides its foreign policy, and pretends to reshape Russia's soft power in the years to come."

Richard Burr (R-NC). From his frequent appearances on network news shows, it is obvious that he is running for re-election on his cloak and dagger work as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which makes accountability difficult to establish. At the same time, it has become clear that -- rather than exercising critical legislative oversight of the intelligence community's most controversial activities from paramilitary drone strikes to N.S.A. bulk collection of phone records -- Mr. Burr all too often is a cheerleader for whatever is going down.No sooner had he become committee chairman this year when he staged an unheard of stunt in trying to reclaim from the executive branch copies of a classified report -- revealing new evidence of torture via ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" by the Central Intelligence Agency -- in order to bury it. It had been issued by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and the committee only weeks earlier.Thus, Burr attempted to erase from the official record the detailed report on the heinous conduct of clandestine operatives as the agency moved suspected terrorists from one black site to another around the world, while brutally mistreating them. If the declassified summary of the full report had not been published in national newspapers, there would have been no trace of what the senator has endeavored to cover up.On April 26, 2015, following President Obama's admission of a botched drone mission in Pakistan back in January that resulted in the killing of a kidnapped American hostage, an Italian hostage, and an American member of al-Qaeda, The New York Times ran a front-page story -- ""Deep Support in Washington For C.I.A.'s Drone Missions"" -- that named several career covert operations officials in the agency's Special Activities Division who have shared responsibility in directing drone assassinations. Incidentally, some identified perpetrators of torture reportedly are still on the agency's payroll.The Intelligence Committee is notified by the C.I.A. of significant anticipated covert actions, with special attention given to targeted Americans. The Times' report also provided a rare glimpse of Sen. Burr when being briefed back in 2013 as he pressed the agency to be more aggressive in hunting down and killing a suspected terrorist, an American citizen, who had become a top al Qaeda operative in Pakistan. (He was captured and is now facing trial in Brooklyn.)The C.I.A. has become a premier actor in the conduct of American foreign policy. Although President Obama has insisted that the C.I.A. and Special Operations Forces take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties, drone strikes have resulted in numerous deaths of Pakistani, Afghan and Yemeni civilians. An investigation of American drone strikes in Yemen, for example, has concluded that the Obama administration did not follow its own rules to avoid civilian casualties. (""Drone Strikes Said to Set A Dangerous Precedent,"" The New York Times, April 14, 2015.) The failure is often in the intelligence about who it is the government is killing.Yet, Sen. Burr recently crowed: ""I believe we do an incredibly effective oversight job on all of the C.I.A.'s programs. And there is no program that receives the level of oversight as the ones we carry out in Pakistan."" (""Sen. Burr Deflects Questions About Calling for Drone Killing,""  McClatchy, April 29, 2015.) Stuff and nonsense! Who would know?The January 15 (2015) strike in Pakistan that killed the hostages reportedly was not brought to the president's attention until mid-April. It was a ""signature strike"" -- uniquely permitted in Pakistan by the C.I.A. -- a category in which the agency has authority to attack based on suspicious patterns of activity even when it cannot identify the individuals being targeted. (""Obama Apologizes for Attack That Killed Two Hostages,"" Washington Post, April 24, 2015.)Director of National Intelligence James Clapper once joked that only one entity in the universe has complete visibility over all government intelligence programs: ""That's God.""It is downright strange for a U.S. Senator, running for re-election in our democracy, to embrace a code of ultra-secrecy surrounding his main brief in Congress. Nevertheless, look for Sen. Burr to go about the country pretending to know all about sensitive intelligence matters; but, alas, he is not free to discuss them. This is the perfect foil for an unaccountable public official, if he is allowed to get away with it.Moreover, Burr suffers from clientitis, co-opted by the bureaucrats he is supposed to ride herd on. His ""imperfect best guesses"" are no better than his latest CIA briefing.

As a kid, I roamed the forests and spent a lot of time in the creeks, especially where I could slide down slick rocks into cold pools. It's a timeless pursuit for kids nationwide, and this summer, children all over the country will go outside to swim and splash in their local waterways, not only the creeks of the North Carolina mountains, but also the shores of Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie, all the way to the rivers of the Sierra Nevada in California. All this swimming can turn into an alarming prospect when you consider that more than 55 percent of our nation's streams and rivers are in poor condition, unfit for swimming, drinking, or fishing. The EPA's annual scientific assessment of the state of our streams and rivers shows a troubling trend of worsening water quality across the United States. At our current rate of water pollution and contamination, kids today may not be able to enjoy summers outside in waters the way their parents have. Even more urgently, in the last decade, the drinking water sources for 117 million Americans have come under threat. The nation's primary water law, the Clean Water Act was passed to prevent this, but thanks to some misguided court decisions and some dirty-water and polluter-friendly loopholes, more than 207,000 miles of streams are completely vulnerable to dumping and pollution, stripped of federal protections leaving local folks who depend on those streams with little if any legal recourse. This week, the EPA finalized a Clean Water Rule to do much better to protect our nation's waterways. The Clean Water Rule is a commonsense plan to make clean water a priority by protecting the sources that feed the drinking water for more than 117 million Americans. It is supported by the public, local elected officials, small businesses, craft brewers, and, crucially, by an overwhelming scientific record. More than 800,000 Americans have called for the Administration to finalize this plan; 87 percent of all the public comments on this rule support its adoption. Over the past decade, millions more have supported efforts to apply the Clean Water Act to all streams and wetlands in order to protect clean water. When the entire drinking water supplies for the cities of Toledo, Ohio, and Charleston, West Virginia, were shut down in 2014 due to pollution and contamination, hundreds of thousands of Americans felt the stakes of life without clean water. We can't afford to lose clean water for hundreds of millions.The Clean Water Rule will protect the drinking water of one in three Americans and will bring $388 million to $514 million in annual benefits to the public. This includes benefits from reducing flooding, filtering pollution, providing wildlife habitat, supporting hunting and fishing, and recharging groundwater.Polluting industries who prioritize ease of dumping their waste into waterways over your clean drinking water or your family's recreation are calling this rule ""overreach."" They are promoting myths and mistruths about the rule, aiming to distract the public from the important work of cleaning up our waterways with politics and spin. They are also lining up their cohort in Congress to block this rule.So whom to believe? Look around you. Let your local waterways be your guide here. Are any of them struggling from pollution problems? Could they use some cleaning up? Do they deserve at least a little protection from dumping? If you don't know about your local water quality, check here, but statistically speaking, everyone in this country lives near some gravely polluted waters or drinks from a threatened water source. There is no one here safe from this problem.Ultimately, if we want to fill our glasses with clean water, and if we want our kids to swim, fish, or play safely in our waters, we have to be willing to protect our all nation's waters, large and small, from the Great Lakes to the headwater streams. This should not be a partisan issue. We applaud the Obama administration for taking this critical step amid such tremendous industry pressure and urge the EPA to do even more to protect our clean water."

After all, conventional wisdom has long held that too many “I”s are a sure sign of a narcissist.Except it’s not true.When researchers tested 4,800 people from four locations in the U.S. and two in Germany, “we could find no association between pronoun use and narcissism,” says Angela Carey, a third-year doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study. “We were surprised by how consistent this near-null finding was.” The new results effectively debunk the source of the myth, a study of just 48 people dating back to the 1980s.Still, Carey admits it’s a hard myth to shake, “because it seems so intuitive, given that narcissism is characterized by a grandiose view of the self and extreme self-absorption.”Besides, she says, people want to read people. “It’s a natural process when we want to determine whether someone is trustworthy.” This is good news for people who lean heavily on “I” and “me” in their speech, and are now off the hook. But it’s bad news for life-changers who want to weed narcissists out early when developing a new life plan—they’re pretty toxic people.And if “I-talk” isn't the way to sniff out a narcissist, what is? The team is currently working on a follow-up study to address that question. “In the meantime, and this is speculative, some possible ways to identify a narcissist might be to pay attention to the amount of bragging they do, any effort to draw attention to themselves by comparing down to others, as well as attempts to draw attention to oneself,"" Carey says.Meanwhile, Carey thinks it’s still smart to limit how freely you say “I” or “me” when trying to make a good impression. “Accurate or not, people may still judge one as narcissistic based on one's use of I-talk,” she says. But feel free to use other ways to show you’re not overly wrapped up in yourself: “Eye contact, a warm tone, and active engagement in the conversation could potentially be ways to still demonstrate concern for others.”Read more from Life Reimagined: 7 Ways To Cut the Cost of Caregiving Use Your Stress To Be Your Best From Empty Nest to No Nest"

We have. This past Sunday actually.Someone should have taken pictures and put them on Facebook. But there was no need really because the best, the absolute best, part was that this party was filled to the brim with ex-colleagues, university friends we hadn't seen in ages and strangers who had never met our usually beautifully behaved (really, I promise!) children... that's not my son in the picture -- ok, maybe it is...?I'm not sure why, but we seem to be the family that is constantly living our lives out loud. We are the ones with the screaming kid, or the kid who turned a 1-year-old's ice cream cake into a watery science experiment, or the toddler who (mid potty training) took a dump on the beach... in front, once again, of ex-colleagues...Why? Why us? Why are we the ones who always seem to be falling apart? Especially when, to be honest, our kids (most times) are absolutely delicious, happy little creatures... I promise you they are! Ask their teachers (they LOVE school!) or any of our friends that see us often when we are relaxed around the house. We are a happy, down to earth and well adjusted little family... except when we are out.I think it has something to do with ego... my ego that is. You see, I am a self-professed, seeking counselling, trying-to-get-over-it-but-just-not-quite-managing A-Type. I am a perfectionist, an over achiever, etc. etc. Go ahead -- label me -- I can take it! Or can I?It has been said that our children are our greatest teachers... that they are the ones who will help us learn more about ourselves than anyone else on this Earth. I believe it. There is nothing in this life more challenging than raising young children. Nothing. Go ahead and climb Mount Everest, walk 800 kilometers across a country in search of yourself, drive from Cape Town to Cairo on a motorbike -- heck, ride a bicycle if you choose to. It will not come close.When you are sleep deprived and over-extended, never feeling good enough, trying to hold it all together, keeping some semblance of a career alive while also remembering every little note and library book and to-do that the various schools require, parents meetings, lunch boxes, flu injections, play-ball fees and birthday cake, all while trying to be the kind of person that is capable of molding another little life who is completely and utterly dependent on you, without their personalities even developed yet or any clue what the world holds for them... you break. Or you outsource. I am starting to think more and more of the latter...So, my esteemed ex-colleagues and university alumni will definitely remember our meeting at a very special birthday party this weekend...I hope they won't judge. I hope they will laugh and feel better about their own experiences with their kids... I love making other people feel better about their own lives!I also hope they will see past the overextended exhausted little men they met that morning... because, you see, our boys are, really they are, incredibly special little men who just didn't do themselves any justice that morning.I promise xxHalfdaymum offers you the resources you need to become the woman and mum you were always meant to be: to discover more about yourself, prioritize your time and focus your passion on the things that are most authentically important to you...You can subscribe to hear the stories of hundreds of mums from around the world, just like you.

Or, better yet, an indication of envy? Or, rather, just tell me how fabulous my life appears to be in comparison to yours.Almost every able-bodied human being over the age of a fetus, with the exception of the Amish, participates in some form of social media. My husband's 90-year-old grandfather is even on Facebook. I am on Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat and Twitter and am therefore unable to keep up with my own social media overload. I, like many of you, have developed a bad habit as a result of it: I am seldom living in the moment. Rather, I'm often revolving about in the social media stratosphere, phone in hand and oblivious to the value of what is right in front of me. In other words, I'm too preoccupied with documenting my life that I am often not enjoying it and being as present as I should be.One day when I have children and a face full of wrinkles, I will be grateful for the pictures I have which captured my freedom and frolicking as a newlywed pre-children, but most of all I will be longing to relive the moments in my mind. Pictures and other means of documentation are valuable because they assist in keeping the memories alive; however, what if they also create a distraction from the importance and beauty of the actual moment?Always Connected, Yet So Fragmented...A couple of years ago an acquaintance of mine, while still in the early stages of us getting to know one another, made an extensive effort to coordinate which one of us would be performing the Facebook ""check-in"" for the evening. While in route to meet her and a few others for dinner, she sent out a group text message which read: I'm going to go ahead and let one of you guys check us in at dinner because I'm always the one to do it. I was amused by her request, however it also felt a bit unsettling.In our society, I occasionally feel as though we spend more time documenting our time spent hanging out by trying to get the pictures and hashtags just right than we do actually talking and connecting with one another. We are rarely ever fully present in one place. We are out with our friends, but are more focused on finding the best lighting for our selfies than actually engaging in conversation. We are out to dinner, but instead of savoring every flavor, we are compulsively making sure to document it on SnapChat, Instagram and Facebook. We feel compelled to show up for our audience. We are always connected, yet so fragmented. While becoming increasingly connected to the outside world, we have become disconnected from ourselves.Because of the social media epidemic, it is also my observation that time spent among friends is often overshadowed by agendas. It often feels contrived and staged. Social media breeds and feeds shallow connections, and I find myself hungry for deeper, more meaningful connections now more than ever. We are starving ourselves while gorging on our incessant compulsion to perform. Worst of all, it is a viciously contagious epidemic! I am not immune. I, too, have too fallen prey to the social media monster despite my hunger for what it can never feed me.While at at coffee shop recently, I observed two girlfriends who snapped at least 30 pictures, in the span of about 30 minutes, all while discussing their social media lives. During their hour of time together, I lost count of how many times I heard them reference Instagram, SnapChat and Twitter, for it dominated 80 percent of their conversation. Most interestingly, they did not part ways without one of them compulsively burying her face in her phone and editing their new pictures. They were seated next to each other in silence, one staring at the other as she edited like a maniac.It was both eye-opening and comical. The obsession was evident. And, sadly, it was clear the driving force and motivation for the obsession was not so much to capture the time spent with a friend as it was proving a point to her audience. She was on stage. In fact, with social media, we are all on stage and are often seeking the best, most robust and ground-shaking round of applause. We often sacrifice the authenticity of our relationships for our delusions of relevance and a false sense of being on stage.""I'm Offended By Your Lack of Social Media Interest...""It is difficult to not be offended if your photos do not receive as many ""likes"" or comments as the next person's. I think the most unfortunate aspect of our compulsiveness to share is that our observers will ultimately receive all of the entertainment out of our lives because we will have been too preoccupied to fully enjoy it ourselves. We may be living magical, colorful and genuinely blessed lives for our audience, but what about us? What about you? What was the actual experience like? How about you take my hand and step off of the stage with me from time to time. We can hop onto the ""Off the Stage And In The Moment"" bandwagon together, for at least a few hours a day. Such fun it will be actually making eye contact, no phone in hand and no distractions, while having a conversation without worrying if the lighting is flattering or if your mom will find your outfit inappropriate. Breathe. Take the moment in, and observe both the lessons and wonder it has to offer. Marvel at the face in front of you. Let's actually live a little, and not worry so much about proving to others how much we are living.I'm just being honest.#GetInTheMomentMovement"

The Seasons Will Always Change.Whatever it is keeping you up at night, tossing, turning, sweating or medicating, will eventually pass. You may be in a storm, but even seemingly endless storms do not last forever. A rainbow will always appear after the rain. The sun will shine again. Spring always follows winter. Inevitably, the season is going to change. Adaptability is what sets the warriors apart from the defeated.Life is a cycle of never-ending changes, and you must possess the ability to adapt to those changes. Do not be frightened of them. Do not cling or clutch to whatever season you are in, and do not try to return to a season of yesterday. Some seasons are for planting seeds and some are for harvest. So, taste the fruit and drink the drink of each. Whether bitter or sweet, it, too, shall pass.2. Don't Be So Dramatic; Your Problems Are Probably Not So Tragic.I realize there are exceptions to this, however I once heard that if people could dump all of their problems out onto the street for trade, the majority of people would want their own problems back. Perhaps you have a friend you call every day for the purpose of unloading your troubles. The truth is, they have troubles, too... perhaps they simply choose to not unload their troubles on you. Everyone is faced with obstacles, including the girl or guy you are absolutely certain has it all. So, if your problems are a matter of consequences of your own mistakes, don't be so dramatic. You are not a victim of a hex, but perhaps hexing yourself with your own mindset. The truth is, you are equipped to handle the hand you have been dealt. So dust off your knees and start believing in your resiliency.3. One Day, If You Live Long Enough, You Will Eat Your Lunch Alone.You know the quiet old man you saw eating alone in a booth yesterday? He is so much more than a quiet old man eating alone. Perhaps he is a boy of 16 who participated in his basketball team winning the state championship. Perhaps he is a man of 22 who returned from the war only to find himself face down, kissing his father's freshly-covered grave. Perhaps he is a man of 30, awed by the miracle of witnessing his first child being born. Perhaps he is a man of 65 who retired after years of intense labor spent providing for his family.He may be sitting quietly alone, a man of 90 with callused hands, bad knees and an aching back, but he is a sea of stories. He is a living, breathing textbook of history with the energy of a thousand better yesterdays still alive and well; still whispering his name. Once upon a time, he may have been someone's heartbreak or someone's hero. He may have been the class clown or the class reject. Perhaps, behind his silence, is a man who has quietly patched his heart up time and again as his most cherished friends and loved ones passed on one-by-one, allowing new generations to inhabit this earth while the echoes of yesterday's beginnings, adventures, milestones and endings continued to inhabit his mind.He may be eating his lunch alone, living a life now barely recognizable to the decades of his past, however, one day, if you live long enough, you will also be living a life barely recognizable to your own. You, too, will eat your lunch alone. So, do not feel pity for the man. Rather, be patient as you walk behind him. Silently congratulate him for having survived on this planet for such a length of time. Have reverence for his sea of stories you will likely never know.4. You Are Going To Die.Someday someone is going to plan your funeral. Someday someone is going to lovingly select the most appropriate ways to commemorate your life. They will select songs to play and photographs to display. Someday someone is going to go through your stuff. They are going to read your journals, empty your wallet fragment-by-fragment, dig through your keepsakes and box up your clothes. Someday someone is going to replay your voicemails and long for just one more chuckle or embrace from you.There are currently approximately seven billion people inhabiting the earth, however there have been approximately 106 billion people to have ever been born and died. That is 106 billion expiration dates with 106 billion tales, some tragic and some triumphant. That's a lot of first tears and final breaths.Someday your life will contain an expiration date. All that you will be remembered for will be contained within it and your birthdate. Someday your life will be a collection of stories. Write them wisely. Write them in color. Write them so that they may bless others.5. You're Not Dead Yet, Though.Stop waiting for life to be kinder, for the storms to calm, for your big break to magically appear, for your white knight to round the corner or for a fair maiden to come and fulfill your every desire. Stop betraying yourself. Stop betraying your dreams. Stop growing bruises. Stop being offended by everything. Stop seeing yourself as a victim. Stop wallowing on the floor, crying out and waiting for the clouds to divide and rain down with answers. Wake up, get up and live."

The Seasons Will Always Change.Whatever it is keeping you up at night, tossing, turning, sweating or medicating, will eventually pass. You may be in a storm, but even seemingly endless storms do not last forever. A rainbow will always appear after the rain. The sun will shine again. Spring always follows winter. Inevitably, the season is going to change. Adaptability is what sets the warriors apart from the defeated.Life is a cycle of never-ending changes, and you must possess the ability to adapt to those changes. Do not be frightened of them. Do not cling or clutch to whatever season you are in, and do not try to return to a season of yesterday. Some seasons are for planting seeds and some are for harvest. So, taste the fruit and drink the drink of each. Whether bitter or sweet, it, too, shall pass.2. Don't Be So Dramatic; Your Problems Are Probably Not So Tragic.I realize there are exceptions to this, however I once heard that if people could dump all of their problems out onto the street for trade, the majority of people would want their own problems back. Perhaps you have a friend you call every day for the purpose of unloading your troubles. The truth is, they have troubles, too... perhaps they simply choose to not unload their troubles on you. Everyone is faced with obstacles, including the girl or guy you are absolutely certain has it all. So, if your problems are a matter of consequences of your own mistakes, don't be so dramatic. You are not a victim of a hex, but perhaps hexing yourself with your own mindset. The truth is, you are equipped to handle the hand you have been dealt. So dust off your knees and start believing in your resiliency.3. One Day, If You Live Long Enough, You Will Eat Your Lunch Alone.You know the quiet old man you saw eating alone in a booth yesterday? He is so much more than a quiet old man eating alone. Perhaps he is a boy of 16 who participated in his basketball team winning the state championship. Perhaps he is a man of 22 who returned from the war only to find himself face down, kissing his father's freshly-covered grave. Perhaps he is a man of 30, awed by the miracle of witnessing his first child being born. Perhaps he is a man of 65 who retired after years of intense labor spent providing for his family.He may be sitting quietly alone, a man of 90 with callused hands, bad knees and an aching back, but he is a sea of stories. He is a living, breathing textbook of history with the energy of a thousand better yesterdays still alive and well; still whispering his name. Once upon a time, he may have been someone's heartbreak or someone's hero. He may have been the class clown or the class reject. Perhaps, behind his silence, is a man who has quietly patched his heart up time and again as his most cherished friends and loved ones passed on one-by-one, allowing new generations to inhabit this earth while the echoes of yesterday's beginnings, adventures, milestones and endings continued to inhabit his mind.He may be eating his lunch alone, living a life now barely recognizable to the decades of his past, however, one day, if you live long enough, you will also be living a life barely recognizable to your own. You, too, will eat your lunch alone. So, do not feel pity for the man. Rather, be patient as you walk behind him.
