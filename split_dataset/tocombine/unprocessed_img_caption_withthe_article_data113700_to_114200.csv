Frustrated by a recalcitrant Congress, Obama has vowed to take climate change into his own hands and is starting to execute his plan to stem the warming of the earth. His plan is a complicated mix of rulemaking and federal permitting thatâs tough to encapsulate in a neat sales pitch, and may be even tougher to put into action. But by going it alone and pledging to use his authority under existing laws, Obama has freed himself from the need to sell the plan to skeptical lawmakers.

It was stunning. One by one, Republican members of the House voted to turn their backs on fairness, compassion and common sense -- and go after DREAMers in California and across America.   We are talking about children and young adults -- many of whom were brought to our country as infants -- who grew up here, went to school here, work here and live here as our neighbors and friends. Now the GOP wants these young dreamers and their families out. It's sad, it's ugly, and it's against everything we stand for as a country.  I am pretty sure that I've never quoted George Will approvingly before, but he had it exactly right when he said: ""My view is that we have to say to these children, 'Welcome to America. You're going to go to school and get a job and become Americans.'"" He also said, ""The idea that we can't assimilate these 8-year-old criminals with their teddy bears is preposterous.""  It was also heartless. Watching that surreal scene on the floor of the House felt like The Wizard of Oz -- with the GOP as the Tin Man searching for a heart. Because while the House Republicans cheered for themselves on that fateful night, history will not look kindly on their ugly attacks on immigrant children.   And this is not an isolated example. On issue after issue facing our country, this is a Republican Party so obsessed with blocking the president -- and now suing the president -- that it has abdicated its most basic responsibility to govern.   Take immigration reform. The sad irony is that we would be better equipped to handle this influx of Central American children if Republicans had just allowed a vote on the bipartisan Senate bill to fix our broken immigration system. Instead they have ignored economists, Fortune 500 CEOs and the Chamber of Commerce who know how much reform would help our economy. They ignore the will of our people. And they have ignored the foundation of America -- a place where almost all families trace their roots to lands half a world away.  It is the same with the highway bill. We live in the most advanced democracy in the world, and yet our roads and bridges are falling apart. Our states, our cities, our drivers, our workers -- everyone is counting on us to fund our critical infrastructure over the long haul. Instead, the House GOP keeps passing short-term band-aids paid for with gimmicks. That isn't governing, it is posturing.   And it isn't governing when Republicans refuse to raise the minimum wage, which has been frozen for five years; when they refuse to make college more affordable for millions of middle class families; or when they refuse to keep bosses from denying their employees access to affordable birth control and other critical health care services. None of that is governing.   I have served with three presidents of the other party. I get it. You are not always going to agree. But you are elected to put politics aside and solve the biggest challenges facing the American people, and that is not happening today.   If all your news came from press releases issued by House Republicans, you would never know that the president has ended two wars.   You would never know that he helped pave the way for 53 straight months of private-sector job growth.   You would never know that the president brought the American auto industry back from the brink, despite the GOP cries of ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.""   You would never know that the deficit has been reduced by more than half.   And you would never know that he brought Osama bin Laden to justice.   You wouldn't hear about any of that. In fact, if you got all your news from House Republican press releases, all you would know about the GOP's do-nothing agenda is what they are against: anything President Obama does to move America forward.   Of course, this blind opposition is the foundation of the Republicans' partisan lawsuit. Their complaint, in a nutshell, is that the president actually wants to govern.   Instead of suing President Obama for governing, the House GOP should try it sometime.   Our country, our economy, and our children -- all of them -- would be much better for it."

The uninsured rate is falling in states that welcomed the ACA. And America's hatred of Congress is getting personal. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, August 5, 2014.ANOTHER ROUND OF PRIMARIES KICKS OFF - Samantha Lachman: ""Since Congress has left town for its five-week recess and focus is turning elsewhere, this week's elections across the country will be met with an even higher level of scrutiny. Six states have primaries over the course of six days: Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington on Tuesday; Tennessee on Thursday; and Hawaii on Saturday. One of the Democratic Party's few competitive Senate primaries will be decided in Hawaii, while Republican Sens. Pat Roberts (Kan.) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) appear to have fended off challenges from more-conservative primary opponents. Those accustomed to having a Rep. Dingell will probably continue having one -- John Dingell (D-Mich.), who is retiring after 59 years in Congress, will most likely be succeeded by his wife, Debbie. On the Republican side, an anti-abortion rights representative who pressured both his ex-wife and a patient who was his mistress to have abortions will see if voters have forgiven him for his hypocrisy. In another Republican race, a former Santa Claus impersonator and reindeer farmer could be booted out of Congress after just one term."" [HuffPost] Roberts leads in Kansas GOP Senate primary - Few of Tuesday's races are hotly contested enough to attract much public polling. The most prominent: Sen. Pat Roberts' (R-Kan.) re-election campaign against tea party-backed radiologist Milton Wolf. Though Roberts faced criticism earlier in the year after a New York Times article found he didn't own a home in Kansas, he easily surpassed Wolf in fundraising. All six publicly released surveys on the race give Roberts a double-digit lead -- the narrowest margin, in a poll conducted for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, still has him 12 points ahead. (That group has since touted a more recent poll that they say narrows Roberts' lead to 9 points, but didn't provide any details about the pollster or methodology.)

[538] UNINSURED RATES FALL IN STATES THAT WELCOMED ACA - Jeffrey Young: ""Obamacare is already making a big difference in the states that actually embraced it. States that expanded Medicaid and created their own health insurance exchanges, or worked closely with the federal government to cover more people, have shown the largest drops in their uninsured rates this year, according to a new poll released by Gallup and Healthways on Tuesday. Leading the pack was Arkansas, where the uninsured rate has fallen by 10.1 percentage points so far this year, and Kentucky, where it has fallen 8.5 percentage points….The Gallup poll underscores the crucial role played by states, which varied in their approach to Obamacare from fully cooperating with its implementation to actively obstructing it….The results of those decisions are clear. States that welcomed the law saw significant drops in their uninsured rate, according to Gallup. The findings are consistent with other recent research showing the uninsured rate barely moved in states that didn't expand Medicaid."" [HuffPost] MOST AMERICANS NO LONGER LIKE THEIR OWN MEMBER OF CONGRESS - HuffPollster: ""A majority 51 percent of Americans disapprove of their own congressional representative, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday. That's the first time in the quarter-century history of the poll that the disapproval rating has risen above 50 percent, outstripping even the 47 percent who disapproved during last year's government shutdown. Terrible ratings for Congress, which has an average approval rating of under 12 percent, are nothing new (a recent survey asking Americans how they'd fix Congress prompted such helpful suggestions as ""lock them in a room together until they get along"" and ""well placed dynamite""). In the past, though, Americans have tended to feel more warmly toward their own district's representative than toward the legislative branch as a whole….That still doesn't mean that most incumbents' jobs are at risk. In the June before Republicans took back the House in 2010, 40 percent of Americans told Gallup their representative didn't deserve to be re-elected, yet 85 percent of members seeking re-election held onto their seats anyhow."" [HuffPost, via WashPost] AMERICANS WANT BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE, DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT - Joan Lowy and Jennifer Agiesta: ""Small wonder Congress has kept federal highway and transit programs teetering on the edge of insolvency for years, unable to find a politically acceptable long-term source of funds. The public can't make up its mind on how to pay for them either. Six in 10 Americans think the economic benefits of good highways, railroads and airports outweigh the cost to taxpayers. Yet there is scant support for some of the most frequently discussed options for paying for construction of new roads or the upkeep of existing ones, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll….[A] majority of all Americans — 58 percent — oppose raising federal gasoline taxes to fund transportation projects such as the repair, replacement or expansion of roads and bridges. Only 14 percent support an increase. And by a better than 2-to-1 margin, Americans oppose having private companies pay for construction of new roads and bridges in exchange for the right to charge tolls. Moving to a usage tax based on how many miles a vehicle drives also draws more opposition than support — 40 percent oppose it, while 20 percent support it. Support for shifting more responsibility for paying for such projects to state and local government is a tepid 30 percent."" [AP] Similar findings - The results echo a HuffPost/YouGov survey in July, in which 45 percent of Americans said the federal government should spend more on infrastructure, and 64 percent that they live near at least a few unsafe bridges or roads.

Kerry met Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu for the second time in 12 hours, as sources said a jailed US-Israeli spy could be key to saving troubled peace talks. AFP PHOTO / POOL / JACQUELYN MARTIN (Photo credit should read JACQUELYN MARTIN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d2132200005700dd7adc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- During an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday"" several weeks ago, Secretary of State John Kerry was confronted with comments he had made in an interview earlier that day, apparently unaware that the cameras were rolling.""It's a hell of a pinpoint operation,"" Kerry said, referring to Israel's airstrikes in Gaza, which the country had promised would cause limited destruction but were killing civilians. ""It's a hell of a pinpoint operation."" As far as hot-mic moments go, it wasn’t abject humiliation. Kerry explained his concerns about collateral damage and moved on. But the second portion of his comments was overshadowed.""We've got to get over there. I think we ought to go tonight,"" Kerry said, before saying it was ""crazy"" for him to be ""sitting around.""A day later, Kerry went to Egypt. After that, he went to Israel and to the Palestinian territories. Then he went back to Egypt, all in an effort to secure a truce to the war raging in Gaza. The effort may have been futile, but it was an effort nonetheless. And it underscored a main ethos of the Kerry-led State Department: that kinetic energy, determination and ""being there"" are instrumental in solving foreign crises.All of which makes the recent articles about Kerry slouching away from the crisis a bit confusing. The Boston Herald on Monday said that Kerry had been ""conspicuously"" absent from the conflict in Gaza after suffering a notable setback in trying to secure a humanitarian ceasefire. The National Review followed up with a non-bylined item titled “While the Middle East Burns.” The Review took the opportunity to post a less-than-flattering picture of Kerry riding a pink bike at his Nantucket estate on Sunday, dragging around his dog on a leash. Certainly, the bike deserved a bit of ridicule. America’s lead diplomat needs -- no, demands -- a manlier ride. How else to convey “stern business” to Vladimir Putin?But the implication that Kerry has been MIA is not really borne out by the facts. A review of his schedule shows that he has made 56 stops to 34 different countries in 2014 alone. He visited France most often (seven times), followed by Jordan (four) and Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (three each).According to the State Department, Kerry has spent 19 days on official travel in the month of July, traveling more than 50,000 miles. He's spent 108 hours and 47 minutes on his plane, or about 4.5 days. His public schedule shows that he spent just five days in Washington, D.C., in July.The guy could probably use some time off. The case could even be made that a little R&R could help his diplomatic game. But Kerry spent the weekend in Nantucket working. A State Department official told The Huffington Post that they “do not, nor have we ever, published a public schedule for the Secretary of State on weekends spent on non-official travel."" But the official did say that Kerry had 16 calls with foreign leaders on Friday, four on Saturday and four on Sunday, all on the situation in Gaza.So “While the Middle East Burns,” Kerry was, at a minimum, dialed in –- perhaps on his bike phone.Marina Fang, Samuel Levine, Akbar Ahmed and David McCabe contributed reporting.Want more updates from Sam?

Who cares? Probably the better question is ""Who should care?""  August 10 is designated as World Lion Day, and as with other allocated ""Days,"" the origin of such an event is to celebrate something globally, and think about how the day, and how the individual or entity being celebrated, influences our lives. I can see a World Dhali Lama Day, or World Peace Day because it has real meaning to the way we live our lives, and our meditations on this affects the way we change course. So at first I wondered if lions actually deserve a day and whether we should really be contemplating the impact that lions have on our lives. Photos by Beverly Joubert of Lions in Botswana  Take a walk in any city in the world and within a few blocks you will see a lion. London, New York, Washington, Shanghai, Helsinki, Nairobi ... flags, statues, icons ... lions are probably the most prolific creatures in the world if we include the symbols that represent them. So it's shocking that hundreds of millions of icons represent a population that is now only around 20,000 real, live, living, breathing, roaring, hunting lions. A hundred years ago we think there were over a million lions. When I was born, maybe 450,000 lions roamed these plains. Today we niggle over if there are 20,000 or 35,000 lions left and forget to look over our shoulders at history. There have never been as few lions on the planet since 3.5 million years ago, when we think that lions evolved from the early saber-toothed cats.  So perhaps celebrating them is wrong. We should actually be mourning the loss of lions. But celebrating, in many ways, is consistent with our long involved relationship with lions. As early hominids we watched them in fear from our dolomite cave entrances near a place called Swartkrans in South Africa, and looked on as dark storms flashed with streaks of lightening behind them as they devoured their kills. This is one of the highest lightening strike zones in the world, the result of which was the eventual dawning of the idea that we could walk down and 'capture' fire and take it back to our caves for warmth and 24 hour light and as a weapon against the marauding giant cats that made our lives a living hell. We also realized that we could scavenge from them, and dig out bone marrow left behind, and suddenly we were in charge of our destiny, not just passive witnesses to the hardships of what was dealt us. We evolved because of big cats, and lions were the biggest in the landscape we wanted to dominate. At some stage there was a tipping point where we developed weaponry: spear, arrows, guns, and within a short time, it was the lions that were dancing to our music, not the other way around. We were no longer shaking in our skins at every roar in the darkness. There has been a back and forth between us and lions ever since as if our destinies we are locked in combative dance, a tango, a flashing set of maneuvers to show our strength, our fitness, our metal capacity to out smart our dance partner: the fearsome lion. Photos by Beverly Joubert of Lions in Botswana  I stepped into a boardroom a few years ago and was confronted by a stuffed male lion, his face set in a snarling position, eyes forever locked in anger. Because I understood what this hapless creature was doing there, I sat in the largest chair at the end of the table with the lion behind me. When the CEO arrived, he was visibly unsettled by my selection of seating, and it confirmed my little experiment that the stuffed lion that the CEO had selected, hunted, shot, imported, filled with glue and now displayed, was about sending a single message: ""If I can do this to our most fearsome and ancient competitor, imagine what I can do to you in this deal, this oil company merger, to you."" While I think it's foolish, safari hunting of lions is all about display, and it's an understandable one if you place it in this context. No hunter wants to kill a lion and then leave it behind. It's about showing the trophy as a measure against oneself. The dance continues.  At some point though we understand that we cannot dance alone. Beverly and I started the Big Cats Initiative with National Geographic to be able to protect those very lions and we now have over 56 projects in more than 22 countries; we're determined that we never dance alone. Photos by Beverly Joubert of Lions in BotswanaWorld Lion Day happens to be on the birthday of my late brother, a famous wildlife artist who crystalized the essence of what a lion is in brush strokes and in bronze, and as I sit in the shade writing this, trying to do the same, four lions are feeding on a buffalo nearby and I wonder at the fact that with our guns and anger, our insatiable desire to dominate everything around us, that we have allowed lions to still exist at all, these giant killers tearing away at flesh nearby. It stems I think, from our capacity to be good as well as bad, selfish as well as kind, creative as well as boorish.  World Lion Day is us at our best, celebrating the very thing that in the past has driven us insane with fear, killed our ancestors, our friends and our livestock. As we celebrate these manic killers in fact we celebrate more than lions and what they represent, we celebrate our capacity to be unselfish and broad minded, and most of all ... tolerant.  World Lion Day is when we celebrate that lions made us who we are.Join a Twitter chat on August 6 at 12:00 p.m. EST with Big Cats Initiative Co-Founders and National Geographic Explorers-in-Residence Dereck and Beverly Joubert.

But instead of getting help from fellow law enforcement officials, Abbott’s work has been compromised by authorities who are eager to get homeless people out of public view, the Independent reported. ""They would like to put them in a bus and send them to Miami or Palm Beach,"" Abbott told the Independent of how homeless people are treated in his area. ""It’s very close to ethnic cleansing. But they are not going to succeed.""Abbott has personally experienced how far law enforcement is willing to go to make life more difficult for people on the streets. The city tried fives times -- and failed -- to prohibit him from feeding the homeless every Wednesday on the beach beneath a tourist strip. But Abbott’s experience has become par for the course in cities across the U.S. these days. Since 2009, the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty has been analyzing anti-homelessness measures in 187 cities. The organization concluded in a recent study that such costly ordinances are on the rise and have not proven to work in reducing homelessness rates. These laws include prohibitions against sitting or lying down in public and sleeping in cars. Supporters of these laws say they are necessary in order to support local businesses and ensure the vitality of their cities.When Columbia, South Carolina, voted to criminalize homelessness last August -- a decision it rescinded soon after -- a number of storeowners spoke out in favor of the ruling. “As small business owners on Main Street we see first hand how the homeless crisis is affecting the city,” Jessica and Joe Kastner, owners of Paradise Ice, said according to the city’s ""Emergency Homeless Response"" report. ""Please think about the everyday citizens, the revitalization of Columbia and the safety of everyone.""Many of these measures, however, have little do with safety. They often simply deprive people on the streets from benefitting from strangers’ goodwill. The effort to curb feeding the homeless has also seen a sharp increase, for example. Last year alone, 53 U.S. communities -- and counting -- issued bans against handing out free food, Michael Stoops, director of community organizing at the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH), told HuffPost. The organization is slated to release an extensive report on the topic later this month.The restrictions have impeded organized groups and individuals alike.For six years, Pastor Rick Wood of Oneonta, Alabama, for example, would hand out water and hot dogs to homeless people every other Saturday. The diligent do-gooder was told in April that he could only continue his bi-monthly service if he obtained a $500 permit, ThinkProgress reported. Public pressure eventually urged Daytona Beach, Florida, police to drop all charges against a Florida couple who was serving meals to the homeless, but not all advocates are as fortunate.While many have defied the law in the name of their mission to help people in need, some are just not willing to go that far. ""We’ve had a number of church groups say, 'We don’t want to go against the law,'"" Stoops told Vice News in June. ""And it has resulted in a number of groups quitting the ministry.""

Meanwhile, so-called ""fast casual"" chains like Chipotle will move higher. Check out the 2013 rankings and Janney's 2020 predictions below:Fast-food burgers are losing popularity for a few reasons. Many Americans, particularly those with higher incomes, are turning to more-upscale chains like Starbucks or Panera. They're also looking for higher-quality food and favoring those chains, like Chipotle and Chick-Fil-A, that promise to deliver it. ""Americans' tastes are evolving,"" Mark Kalinowski, Janney's lead restaurant analyst, told The Huffington Post, with customers hungrier for more ""adventuresome"" foods like the offerings at Chipotle or Taco Bell. And the lower-income customer base for McDonald's, and its burger-flipping rivals Wendy's and Burger King, is still struggling, years after the recession, McDonald's Chief Operating Officer Tim Fenton recently admitted. All of this makes it tougher for burger chains like Wendy's and Burger King to stand out. McDonald’s, on the other hand, will probably keep dominating the industry, largely because it has been such a huge presence for so long that its position can't realistically change much any time soon, Kalinowski said. And McDonald's is trying to adjust to Americans' changing appetites -- for example, by trying to convince customers that it, too, makes quality food. Based on a recent Consumer Reports survey that found McDonald's rated lowest among all fast-food restaurants on taste, that might be a tough sell. "

Chris Christie (R) is getting some fundraising help from the man who once called him ""pufferfish,"" made fun of his weight and passed him over for the vice-presidential spot on the Republican national ticket.According to CNN, two-time presidential hopeful Mitt Romney (R) will appear at a September fundraiser with Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association and a possible 2016 presidential contender. The event is being promoted as a birthday celebration for Christie, who will turn 52 on Sept. 6. According to an invitation to the event, attendees can pay $150 for general admission, $5,000 to attend a private reception or $25,000 to attend a roundtable. The Christie fundraiser is the latest in a series of national appearances for Romney, who has been back in the spotlight while campaigning on behalf of GOP candidates this year. A recent CNN/ORC International poll found that if the 2012 election had been held last week, Romney would have defeated President Barack Obama.While Romney and Christie have already fundraised together this year, the relationship between the two Republicans hasn't always been so amiable. There was tension between the two in 2012 when Romney was irked that Christie banned him from raising money in New Jersey until the governor gave his approval. Romney also called Christie personally to apologize after it was revealed he had made fun of his weight. "

Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, stop drug testing new employees for marijuana.""No one is saying that employers should be forced to deal with workers who are intoxicated at the office,"" the petition reads, ""but off-duty marijuana use doesn't negatively impact a journalist's ability to do his or her job. Traditional drug testing programs cannot determine whether someone is currently high; they merely test for metabolites that indicate whether someone used marijuana as far back as a month ago. The Times should replace its outdated drug testing policy.""As of Monday, the petition has received almost 4,500 signatures in support. ""The Times and its publisher have a great position on the need to end government discrimination against people who use marijuana,"" Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, told The Huffington Post. ""It's very hard to understand why the Times feels like it needs to check the content of journalists' urine before they're allowed to report stories.""A Times spokeswoman wouldn't go into detail but told HuffPost last week that the paper's policy for drug testing hasn’t changed, despite the editorial board's decision to support legalization.“Our corporate policy on this issue reflects current law,” the spokeswoman said.But Angell takes issue with that stance. ""There's absolutely nothing on the lawbooks that requires the newspaper to continue carrying out this wasteful and discriminatory practice,"" Angell said. ""It's up to the publisher alone, and he should match the paper's great editorial talk with some ethical HR walk.""Despite the paper running a series of op-eds beginning last week calling on the federal government to repeal marijuana prohibition, the Times is one of several big media companies that still require new hires to take a drug test.Editorial page editor Andy Rosenthal spoke about the apparent gap between the editorial position of the paper and the HR practice of drug testing employees on MSNBC's ""All In With Chris Hayes"" last week.""Whether we're going to continue testing for marijuana or not, I don't know,"" Rosenthal said. ""If they ask me, I'll say stop. But they won't. They tend not to [consult the editorial page on HR issues]."""

It's hard to believe, but people are surprised by this. University presidents were rattled when President Obama announced plans to rate their institutions on factors including the annual income of graduates. The demand for career readiness among college students is exploding, and universities are playing catch-up as the finish line moves from college matriculation to graduation and now to career. Clearly, colleges can and must do more to ensure that students are ready to conduct job searches and start careers. I'm not talking about how to write a resume or cover letter. I'm referring to how to build social capital, the network of connections, shared values and norms that are critical to professional success. We know that 60 to 80 percent of jobs are filled through word-of-mouth--it's called the hidden job market--and to find those jobs, who you know is as important as what you know. This means that social capital is one of the most important assets that students bring to their job searches. Some students arrive on campus with plenty of social capital; they have great contacts built through family connections and childhoods spent in privileged neighborhoods. They have summers of work experience thanks to internships they got through those connections. But for others, college is their first chance to start intentionally building a professional network and mobilizing those relationships to find fulfilling jobs.College and universities can make this much easier by adding programs that teach the skills that students need and by giving them a chance to practice using those skills.My organization, The Opportunity Network, has developed a curriculum on ""Career Fluency""--how to build work experience, master professional skills and cultivate networks to launch successful careers as college graduates. We both teach specific skills that students need to develop, like how to introduce yourself professionally or how to cultivate a relationship, as well as the emotional understanding and confidence they need to use these skills successfully. We use tools like network maps that help students identify and build on the social capital they already have. And we give them opportunities to practice through fun and fast-paced events like Speed Networking, where students meet numerous professionals and explore several career paths over the course of one evening.The results speak for themselves--85 percent of our students hold career-track jobs or are in graduate school within six months of completing college.There are several ways that colleges and universities can integrate career readiness into their programs. Administrators can offer workshops during freshman orientations. Faculty can teach about social capital in freshman seminars. Career planning centers can offer special programs throughout the year. Alumni relations staff can add Speed Networking to their events calendars. It is heartening that some universities are already moving in this direction, and I hope others follow their lead. By defining career readiness as an institutional value, universities and colleges can do a great service for their students. And they may well safeguard their own relevance."

Three key words emerge in my reflection.",2014-08-04,"The Korean War Memorial, Washington, DC. The inscription reads: ""Our nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met. 1950 - Korea - 1953"" And ""Freedom is Not Free""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b6b240000330076e4cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama recently designated July 27 as ""Korean War Veteran's Armistice Day."" One day before the Proclamation was announced I attended a very moving ceremony commemorating the 61st anniversary of the Armistice that ended the bloodshed of the Korean War. In the days since, I have found myself reflecting on the meaning of the Armistice and on the effect it has had on my country in the intervening 60 years. Three key words emerge in my reflection:First: Gratitude. Gratitude for the profound sacrifices of the soldiers from the United States and 21 UN nations who fought for freedom in Korea. Six decades later, the bravery and dedication of these veterans humble us in Korea; we know that the freedom and prosperity that we enjoy today flow directly from their sacrifices. And we will never forget those who fought ""to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.""When the Armistice was signed, some here in the United States were not sure the War was worth the fight. It was called ""the Forgotten War,"" considered a tie. But last year, at the Armistice's 60th anniversary, President Obama reminded us of the war's true legacy. ""When 50 million South Koreans live in freedom,"" he said, ""that's a victory."" The Pentagon's exhibition on the Korean War, which opened last year, reflects this legacy: no longer is the Korean War ""the Forgotten War,"" it is now called ""the Forgotten Victory."" And Korea will always be grateful for the freedom that this victory made possible. Second: Pride. Pride at the immense progress Koreans have made in 60 short years. Today, our country stands as a free and prosperous nation, dedicated to democratic principles and an open economy. It was hard work and times were tough, but we knew that if we set our minds to it and worked diligently, we could create a better country for our children that gave them the freedom to thrive. When President Obama described the legacy of the victory in Korea last year, he spoke proudly of Korea as ""a vibrant democracy, one of the world's most dynamic economies, in stark contrast to the repression and poverty of the North."" Our commitment to our hard-won freedoms is unwavering, and today Korea stands as a shining example of the strength of democratic principles and open markets. We are intensely proud of the country that we have built, even as we know we were not alone through its creation.Third, I feel hope. Hope for the future. We know that we still have much work to do to preserve our democracy, and we know that maintaining our prosperity will require effort. But I am confident that, with the passion of our citizens and the creativity of our entrepreneurs, we will be able to ensure a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous future for all Koreans. My hope extends to our relationship with the United States as well. From a foundation based on our shared values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, Korea and the United States are building a Global Partnership that will address some of the most intractable issues of our time such as global poverty, climate change, cyber-security and nuclear proliferation. This then, is the most hopeful legacy of the Armistice that ended the Korean War: that our bilateral cooperation will continue to flourish, making a more peaceful, democratic, and prosperous future not just for Koreans, but for the whole world."
