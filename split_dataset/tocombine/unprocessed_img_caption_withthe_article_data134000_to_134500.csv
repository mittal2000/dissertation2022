Chase and other banks say they will cover unauthorized transactions that customers report.""Banks are putting various precautions in place,"" Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said by email, declining to be specific about what the banks are doing.Representatives for other major banks, including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, told Reuters on Saturday that their institutions take steps to protect accounts, but none described specific actions so broadly limiting to cardholders as those of Chase.Target's Snyder said that for the debit card it issues and calls Redcard, the company has activated a ""deeper fraud monitoring protocol."" She did not describe the new steps.Chase said in its notice to customers that it realized its move ""could not have happened at a more inconvenient time with the holiday season upon us.""At Chase, the usual debit card daily limits are $200 to $500 for cash withdrawals and $500 for purchases, according to a bank spokeswoman.""It seems like the banks are the 'Grinch who stole Christmas,'"" said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group based in Los Angeles. ""It is Target's fault, but children across America are going to bear the price ... The banks are protecting themselves.""Chase spelled out the new limits in an email to customers with the subject line: ""Unfortunately, your debit card is at risk by the breach at Target stores.""Target said on Thursday that computer hackers had stolen data from as many as 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season.Chase said in the letter that it plans to reissue affected debit cards over the coming weeks and in the meantime said employees at its 5,600 branches would help those who need more cash. Many branches will stay open late if needed, the letter said.Debit cards, unlike credit cards, typically require customers to enter personal identification numbers when they make purchases at store check-out counters. Initial reports of Target's security breach said data may have been taken through devices at its counters.Debit cards are used to spend money that has been deposited in checking and other demand accounts at banks."

As first reported by Entertainment Weekly, the ""True Blood"" star's mutant persona, Rogue, was left on the cutting room floor. Director Bryan Singer revealed that he had axed a rescue scene involving Magneto, Professor X, Iceman and -- you guessed it -- Rogue, from the final film. Unfortunately for Paquin, this was only scene that included her character. Singer explained the situation to EW.com:“It’s a really good sequence and it will probably end up on the DVD so people can see it. But like many things in the editing process, it was an embarrassment of riches and it was just one of the things that had to go ... Even though she’s in the materials and part of the process of making the film, she won’t appear in it.”Singer explained that the cut had nothing to do with Paquin's acting, and that he would love to work with her in the future. Like a gentleman, Singer has already informed Paquin of the situation and says she ""completely understood.""According to HitFix, however. there's still a chance Paquin could end up seeing some screen time after the film's upcoming reshoots."

Like Target's decision to opt out of stocking ""Beyonce,"" the online retailer is following suit in the wake of the album's iTunes exclusive week-long sale. However, physical copies can be found on Amazon via third-party sellers.Billboard also noted how Amazon has not provided ""Beyonce"" with any prime real estate, meaning that the album is only visible when searched. Considering the album's record-shattering numbers, it would be expected that retailers would promote heavily. The question that immediately comes to mind is, ""Do people still buy CDs?"" Despite an MP3 driven world, physical copies do have their appeal. In 2012, physical sales may have continued to decline, but they still trumped the rising digital sales. With Beyonce's success, can we expect to see more exclusive deals with Apple? If so, how deeply will this injure physical retailers? Or is this just an anomaly resulting from Beyonce's supreme clout?

So in this last post of the year, I want to highlight some of the very good things that happened:In February, the largest climate march and rally in American history filled the National Mall. More than 50,000 people braved one of the coldest days of the year to let President Obama know that we expect him to lead on climate -- starting with a rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline. Not so long ago, the conventional wisdom was that the pipeline was a foregone conclusion. Thousands of grassroots activists have both turned that around and raised national awareness of the dangers of extreme fuels like tar sands.Earlier that week at the White House, I joined with Sierra Club Board members Allison Chin and Jim Dougherty and several dozen other grassroots environmental leaders in the Sierra Club's first-ever civil disobedience.In March, President Obama designated five new national monuments, including Rio Grande del Norte in New Mexico and the San Juan Islands in Washington State. Less than a month later, the Senate confirmed his nominee for Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell -- a dedicated outdoor enthusiast who understands the economic, recreational and conservation benefits of protecting public lands. Here's hoping that 2014 sees even more ambitious monument designations and protections for public lands.In June, President Obama delivered a groundbreaking speech that laid out his Climate Plan: ""As a president, as a father, and as an American, I'm here to say we need to act."" The Obama administration has already followed through on elements of the plan, including ending financing of overseas coal plants, but has much to do in 2014 to meet the obligation and clean energy opportunities identified by the president, particularly by curbing carbon pollution from power plants and by rejecting projects that would expand dirty fuel production, such as the Keystone XL pipeline, drilling in the Arctic and new LNG export terminals.About those carbon standards: They mean that 2013 is the year that coal-fired power, which was already in decline, lost all hope of a comeback. The EPA not only released draft carbon-pollution standards for new power plants but also held listening sessions on standards for existing power plants -- which were filled with passionate proponents of clean energy. In October, the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign celebrated its 150th coal plant retirement. Eight more retirements have been announced since then. Strong carbon-pollution standards will only accelerate the move away from dirty coal. Progress in fighting dirty fuels is great, but it's even better when accompanied by a surge in clean energy. Because Congress waited too long to renew the Production Tax Credit, the wind industry got off to a slow start this year, but it's sure booming now, as evidenced by the $1 billion order for turbines placed just this week by Warren Buffett's MidAmerican Energy. Wind is increasingly competitive with both coal and natural gas and, in places like Iowa, is already the least expensive source of new power. In 2014, expect to see more utilities choosing to invest in renewables for mainly economic reasons, as Xcel Power in Colorado did this year.By the way, falling costs also helped made this a record-breaking year for solar power, with enough new solar electric capacity added to power more than 850,000 average American homes. The Sierra Club's own Solar Home Program has now helped more than 1,000 homes go solar.There's no way to know exactly what challenges next year will bring, but one thing I am confident about is that we're going to build on all the progress we made this year in replacing dirty fuels with clean energy sources. Here's to a happy renewable year in 2014."
