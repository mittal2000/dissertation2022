Along with the 21 delegates of the G(irls)20 Summit, there will be many important officials, community leaders, and organizations in attendance. The commencement will feature two extraordinary Mexican women who have dedicated their lives to empowering women and girls, particularly by example. These women are global changemakers.Ambassador Patricia Espinosa, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Mexico, will offer some welcoming remarks. Ambassador Espinosa is an incredibly accomplished woman. She has been a member of the Mexican Foreign Service since 1981. She was promoted to Ambassador in 2000 and appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs in 2006. She has served as Ambassador to Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Germany. She was a Permanent Representative to the International Organizations in Vienna. She studied International Relations at El Colegio de México and continued her postgraduate studies in International Law at the Institute for High International Studies in Geneva. She is fluent in Spanish, English, German, and French. The Delegates at an evening dinner with GirlUp! Tomoko Kaida (Japan), Magdaly Santillanez (Mexico), Barbara Cesar (Brazil), Noura Al Otaiwi (Saudi Arabia), Elisabeth Jessop (USA), Disty Winata (Indonesia), Fisher Wu (China), Glender Favour (Cameroon/African Union), Priyanka Roychoudhury (India)Followed by Espinosa, the audience will hear from the First Lady of Mexico, Margarita Zavala. She will welcome the 21 delegates to the G(irls)20 Summit and focus on ""why the world needs to invest in girls and women."" Although she is the First Lady of Mexico, she is very accomplished in and of herself. Early on, she was fighting for gender equity. In 1995, she spoke at the World Conference on Women in Beijing. She first entered the public sector as a local delegate at the Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District in 1994. From 2003 to 2006, she was a deputy for the National Action Party (PAN) in the LIX Legislature of the Mexican Congress. Prior to this, she was the Legal Director of the National Executive Committee and National Secretary of Political Promotion of Women for PAN from 1999 to 2003. She is the only First Lady of Mexico to have ever served in congress. In 2001, she helped to found the Board of Directors of the National Women's Institute (INMUJERES). She has not only been involved in government, but she is currently the President of the civic advisory board to the National System for Integral Family Development (DIF). DIF promotes child and family development in Mexico. In 2008, she launched a campaign for drug prevention among children and youth and she has worked constantly to protect unaccompanied migrant children through Mexico. She also teaches law and has worked at various law firms across Mexico. She is the mother of three children. Zavala is truly an accomplished woman, fighting for gender equity and supporting the women of her country. As an icon for women's empowerment, she has served other women beyond the borders as well.The G(irls)20 Summit will run Monday and Tuesday and focus on issues of food security and gender-based violence in terms of opportunity lost and opportunity gained for women. The 21 Delegates from the G20 Nations, plus the African Union, will present a communiqué of suggestions to the Sherpas of the G20 in an effort to put women on the agenda.The Delegates arriving in Mexico City! Elisabeth Jessop (USA), Magdaly Santillanez (Mexico), Claire Charness (Canada), Sally Dimachki (France), Fisher Wu (China)As the U.S. Delegate, I am well aware of issues facing women in my own country. I would like to see more women like First Lady Zavala and Ambassador Espinosa act as leaders in my own country. Currently, only 17 percent of the U.S. Congress are women. Women need to be empowered and aware of their own voice and potential to make a difference. Women are the key to economic productivity and social stability. It's time to engage! Let's start by putting girls and women on the agenda at the G20 Summit.There are 3.5 billion girls around the world that have the power to create change. I am number 4,541. What's your number?"

You jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance."" -- Hamlet, Act III, scene 1As sentient beings we yearn to be loved unconditionally, and we were raised in a highly competitive society that taught us tools to gain love conditionally -- mostly through doing and accomplishing certain tasks, achieving certain goals, and/or appearing and speaking in particular ways. Ever since we were infants we received positive reinforcement -- smiles and ""yes!'s"" -- when we behaved or appeared in ways that pleased our caretakers, and we received negative reinforcement -- frowns and ""no!'s"" -- when we behaved or appeared in ""uncivilized"" ways that displeased our caretakers. Carl Jung spoke of the personas that we create in order to interact with others. More pejoratively, D.W. Winnicott theorized that we developed ""false selves"" in order to help survive our childhoods as we acclimated to the demands of our society. I think we can agree that we have facades that we use to interact with most people, and then we have our somewhat unglamorous and often unseemly real or authentic selves that we only show a few close friends and family members. But what if the tools we developed as children that are now part of our personas/facades don't actually help us get our emotional needs met? What if those tools actually inhibit authentic relationships, connections and interactions? Maybe we acquired tools such as fear, suspicion and doubt, which protected us in our youth but now cause us to hack into our lovers' email accounts to see if they are remaining faithful? Maybe we procured the tool of seduction and know how to attract people's attention and provide them with moments of titillation and glee, but remain unsure if they love us? Maybe we discovered the tool of playing the victim, of drawing people into our dramas and forcing them to take care of us? Maybe we cultivated the tool of providing material comforts for others but end up resenting them for being gold-diggers? Maybe we learned how to fill our lives up with busy-ness in order to seem important but are now perceived as frenetic, disorganized and distant by others? Maybe we were taught to smile and look happy on the outside even when we feel alienated, misunderstood and disconnected on the inside? Maybe we learned passive-aggressive language to avoid being vulnerable?What interpersonal tools did you acquire growing up? Are they still helping you get your emotional needs met?""When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem resembles a nail."" -- Abraham Maslow.Are you open to expanding your toolbox and repertoire?If you take a look at your patterns, you may find that many of your tools -- your reactions -- are misguided and even maladaptive. For example, some of our tools push people away when we want to bring them closer; some of our tools cause people to flee because they inadvertently signal desperation and neediness.We need to examine the ways our minds have been programmed to act and react and find how to take ourselves off of autopilot so that we can be truly present and show up authentically. Otherwise, we're not much more than a pre-packaged bundle of reactions waiting for stimuli to trigger those reactions.In my workshops, I use simple mindfulness exercises to demonstrate that many of our reactions are maladaptive and actually hinder us from getting our emotional needs met. This is why we need to learn how to cultivate non-reactivity, which is one of the immediate benefits of both yoga and meditation. If we can learn how to observe our thoughts, feelings and reactions to stimuli rather than simply act them out unconsciously, then we can make decisions that bode more favorably for our long-term health and well-being.In addition, I love to provide students and clients with new tools to help them gain confidence to show up authentically for relationships -- tools such as Marshall Rosenberg's ""Non-Violent Communications,"" Imago Therapy's reflexive listening, and finally, my personal favorite, the tombstone exercise: Whenever I treat bickering couples I reframe their often heated, finger-pointing conversations by asking them ""What do you want it to say on your tombstone?"" Nobody wants it to say, ""Was Right!"" on his or her tombstone. Most sane people want it to say, ""Beloved."" So why do we spend so much of our mental lives making ourselves ""right"" and other people ""wrong""?? Obviously, this is a flaw in the design of the mind, one that we can use mindfulness and non-reactivity to remedy.I like what Leonard Cohen said about what people do to try to get their needs met: ""We are not mad, we are human, we want to love, and someone must forgive us for the paths we take to love, for the paths are many and dark, and we are ardent and cruel in our journey.""Many of us have toolboxes full of rather blunt and often unsophisticated, childish tools that we employ to get our emotional needs met, e.g., posturing, boasting, lying, whining, complaining, etc. But once we make the decision to take ourselves off of autopilot and live mindfully and authentically, the possibilities for real connections, peace, ease, calm, love, and joy flourish.
