While I'm battling a myriad of eye issues at the moment, not everyone's worries are the same. Some constantly deal with dark circles, while others wake up to puffy bags. Though for most, the very thin skin around the eyes is becoming increasingly drier, which ultimately means fine lines. Whatever your issue, you can find an eye cream that targets your specific problem. Before investing in your next eye cream, check out our product guidelines, then flip through the gallery below for the best new (and effective) formulations on the market. Hydrate. Then hydrate some more: This is the most important rule when it comes to keeping eyes youthful and staving off fine lines and wrinkles. Find a consistency that will last you through the day to ensure you're always being protected. And no shame in touching up: The great thing about eye creams is that they are usually housed in small containers, great for stowing away in makeup bags. If dryness is your big issue, look for a balm. It will sink in to moisturize, but will last a little longer due to its slightly richer texture. And don't forget to keep a light, steady hand and pat on with your ring finger, which is the weakest, meaning application will be more gentle.De-puff: Swollen areas means the skin around your eyes is retaining fluids, which can be caused by everything from alcohol to salt intake, and of course lack of sleep. To minimize puffiness, look for products that contain anti-inflammatory ingredients, like soothing chamomile and caffeine.Banish dark circles: While some people are more likely to develop darker skin under their eyes (due to genetics, eczema and aging), there are ways to combat this tell-tale sign of exhaustion. A cream with green tea and vitamin C will help lighten the darker areas in the longterm, while formulas with a slight tint will remedy the situation immediately. Year-round sun protection: SPF is a no-brainer, but look for a formula that will be ultra-hydrating. Even though summer is officially over, that doesn't mean it's time to stop using sunscreen; the sun is just as harmful in the colder months. SPF in a small tube will make it even easier to keep the eye area protected. Meanwhile, did you know you can conceal dark circles with orange makeup?   Want more?

In fact, we watched it several times to really absorb the magnitude of it all. To be quite honest, I don't think that I've fully wrapped my head around it. The one thing that really got me emotionally, in addition to the actual landing that looked like it was straight out of an HD sci-fi movie, was the sheer happiness that the JDL team displayed. Everyone jumped, raised their hands and took in this one feeling: awesomeness. It was absolutely inspiring to me, but to my kids, that feeling was amplified a million fold. There is no end to what we can accomplish if we really put our minds together.My oldest son is obsessed with science and math. He is the kind of kid that reads algebra books for fun. Seriously. My middle son, on the other hand, is a skateboarder with a school aversion. He doesn't care much for science, but a mohawk will catch his attention, regardless of the circumstance. That's why the person in the front row of the NASA live stream (about a minute and forty two seconds in) totally caught his eye. ""I think that scientist has a mohawk with stars on its side."" We paused the stream and confirmed that yes, this scientist, Bobak Ferdowsi, has a full-on mohawk. This meant so much to my somewhat-apathetic-towards-science middle son. Science can be cool?Even President Obama thinks so. Watch his conversation with the Mars Discovery team. My favorite quote? ""You guys are a little cooler than you used to be."" Are they ever. For one of the first times in their lives, my kids together were brought together over a shared interest. When we were given the opportunity to interview the man behind the mohawk, we jumped at the chance. My oldest son, hereafter referred to as ""J,"" composed a series of questions -- with his younger brothers' approval, of course.J: Did you dream of working for NASA when you were younger?Bobak: A lot. I started out with a love of cars, but pretty early on I started reading science fiction, and then I became obsessed with space. When I was younger it was mostly about sending people to space, but right around the time I graduated high school, the people here at JPL landed the Pathfinder mission on Mars. The whole idea of putting things on another planet was so cool and it motivated me to pursue areas of study more like what JPL does.J: Why did the Rover take three years to land on Mars?Bobak: I'm not sure what the three years refers to, but it took us 8.5 months to get from Earth to Mars...[and] we traveled about 350 million miles to get there! The timing and length of that trip is all determined by our navigation team, but it basically comes down to what is most efficient -- it takes a lot of energy to get there, and so there are times when the orbits of Earth and Mars line up (about every 26 months) that are best for efficiency. We launched on November 26, 2011 and landed on August 5, 2012. In terms of what it takes to make a rover, well that took years (I've been on this project for almost nine years). It starts with coming up with concepts for what we want to do, then [creating] different designs until we settle on a final one. After that it takes thousands of people to fill in all the details, build it, test it and eventually send it to Mars.J: What's it like working for NASA?Bobak: Pretty amazing. I really love it here. There are days that are more challenging than others, but I really do look forward to work every day. It's really fun because I do feel like I'm working on some of the same science fiction that I grew up reading. One of the best things about it NASA is that everyone is really passionate and hardworking, and most importantly, I am surrounded by very bright, very kind people who all share a common goal.J: Do you think that you will find civilization on Mars and why? Bobak: I doubt we'll find civilization on Mars, because civilization usually leaves a mark big enough that we can see it from space (think farms, cities, etc). There's a possibility we could find life one day (though if it's there, it's likely under the surface). Curiosity will mostly look for what life needs to survive -- whether those are there today or if they were once there in Mars' history. Future missions could look for life depending on what we find with Curiosity.J: Do you identify with Howard on the Big Bang Theory?Bobak: Sometimes. I also hang out with a bunch of very smart and funny people, too. Fortunately my friends don't give me such a hard time!(Editor's note: J loves The Big Bang Theory, which has a ton of adult content. Thanks, wonderful in-laws for introducing him to this show on a sleepover! Thankfully, most of it goes over his head... but not the science, never the science!) J: How far is the Earth from Mars?Bobak: It changes a lot. Right now it's about 160 million miles away. Depending on how we line up though, it can get as close as about 35 million miles away, and as far as approximately 250 million miles away.J: What's your favorite algorithm?Bobak: It's silly, but one of my favorites (because we use it so much for our communications) is the Fast Fourier Transform. In our everyday lives, we use it everywhere without realizing. It's basically a very efficient way of evaluating frequencies (like radio waves).  Bobak, you are amazing. Thanks for inspiring the next generation with your crazy cool hair and overall mad smartness. You rock!"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c3a283c00004c0009ae97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ABOARD RMS QUEEN MARY 2, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The first time Edward Harris crossed the Atlantic on a liner named ""Queen Mary"", he was a young man travelling in the lowest ""steerage"" class emigrating to America.Half a century on, Harris - now 77 and recently retired as the owner of a U.S.-based travel business - is on his seventh such voyage, having developed something of a taste for sea crossings between his birthplace in England and adopted home.More than twice the size of the original ""Queen Mary"" - launched 1936, retired 1967, now a floating Los Angeles hotel - the modern ""Queen Mary 2"" has a very different feel from those early trans-Atlantic liners, perhaps closer to the modern cruise ships that ply the Caribbean and elsewhere, stopping at ports along the way.The wooden deckchairs that line the promenade deck beneath the lifeboats may be the most potent physical reminder of what life was like aboard the QM2's predecessors. But the sense of separation from the outside world that comes with seven days at sea between Southampton and New York remains largely the same.""I love it,"" Harris told Reuters four days into an August voyage. ""You can't get phone calls, you get into a rhythm. It's a great feeling, even on a completely different ship.""After an annual world cruise to Australia between January and March, the Cunard-owned QM2 spends most of the rest of the year on the last scheduled transatlantic passenger schedule as what one crewmember called ""the world's poshest ferry service"".Certainly, some aboard - including this reporter, paralysed from the shoulders down and headed to the United States for an assignment in Washington with a bulky electric wheelchair and some unpleasant memories from flying - are using her as just that.But for the majority of the roughly 2600 passengers aboard, many on their second, third or fourth trip, the appeal is the voyage itself.In their 20th-century heyday, the liners carried all levels of society, from great celebrities to those like Harris who scraped together all they had to share a cabin with bunk beds. Sea crossings gradually gave way to air travel as transatlantic services increased after World War Two.Passengers today are often older, with an average age sometimes well above 50. But - particularly in the summer - there are also younger couples and families, as well as the occasional backpacker.On almost every voyage, the ship hosts a reunion of anyone aboard who sailed on the previous ""Queen"" liners. A dozen or so passengers - sometimes more than 20 - share reminiscences of stormy passages, shipboard dalliances and slipping crewmembers money for tours of the most exclusive first-class dining areas.Others recall when the original ""Queen Mary"" and sister ""Queen Elizabeth"" were used as troop ships during World War Two, running a gauntlet of German air attacks and U-boats.""Is it an anachronistic way to cross the Atlantic?"" says Chris Wells, the current captain. ""Perhaps. But it has a romance that you simply don't get with air travel.""The cheapest cabins aboard - inside double rooms with no view - can retail for under £700 per head, while more luxurious, larger and better located twin level or multiroom cabins can cost several times that. The price includes all on-board food and entertainment but not alcohol.Cunard still offers two separate upper classes with separate dining and socialising spaces. But even those in the cheapest cabins have waiter-served three-course meals and a dress code that for several nights includes black tie.Crossings in both directions, Cunard officials say, are almost invariably fully booked - leading some to ponder whether a second ship might one day be added to the route. GYM, LIBRARY, BALLROOM, WHALESWhen the New York- and London-listed cruise giant Carnival Corp bought the ageing Cunard line in 1998, the British firm - founded in 1840 and later merged with White Star, owners of the ill-fated ""Titanic"" - was widely seen in terminal decline.Its flagship, the much-loved ""Queen Elizabeth 2"" (QE2), was approaching retirement and there were doubts a transatlantic liner could survive in the modern era.Carnival - which also operates a string of other major lines including P&O, Holland American and Costa, owner of the Costa Concordia which sank in January off Italy with the loss of 32 lives - thought differently.Built in the French port of Cherbourg, the QM2 entered service in 2004 as the largest passenger ship ever built, accommodating some 2600 passengers and well over 1000 crew - although that record has since been surpassed by new vessels.The ship boasts 15 bars and restaurants, five swimming pools, a casino, theatre and cinema/planetarium. A woodpanelled library overlooks the prow and open ocean, as does the spa and on-board gym. Daytime activities include lectures by historians, journalists and others, needlework sessions, wine tasting and watercolour classes.For those who cannot bear to be disconnected, there is a sluggish - and pricey - satellite Internet connection. But for much of the day, many passengers seem content to simply read, stare at the ever-changing seascape or walk the promenade deck, each circuit 620 metres and three equalling just over a mile.The occasional sight of a whale or dolphin prompts a periodic rush to the hand rails with smart phones and cameras.Unlike with ""Titanic"", QM2's owners make no claims the ship is unsinkable - although nervous travellers can take comfort from the fact the ship carries more than enough lifeboats for all. On winter passages, she sails further south and keeps a close lookout to avoid the ice that sank her legendary predecessor in April 1912. BUILT FOR TOUGH CONDITIONSMore recently launched Cunard sister ships ""Queen Elizabeth"" and ""Queen Victoria"" are of almost equivalent size and have the same black hull and white superstructure of historic liners. But while they tend to sail traditional cruise routes, QM2 is specifically designed for the tough North Atlantic.The ship's deck plating is an inch thick - twice that of many conventional cruise ships - and the hull is streamlined to cut through the largest waves. Stabilising fins can also be deployed to reduce the movement of the ship.While the great liners of the past would often tie up in the heart of Manhattan, QM2 is so large that she would block a significant part of the Hudson River.Instead, the ship docks in nearby Brooklyn, towering some 14 stories above the quayside and passing under the Verrazano-Narrows suspension bridge with metres to spare.Despite the earliness of the hour - around 5 a.m. - the decks and lookout points are almost invariably packed as the ship enters port, passing the Statue of Liberty like thousands before her.For New York litigator Victor Stewart, 61, whose earliest memories include the multiple crossings with his parents aboard the original Queen Mary, some of the magic has been lost, and the on-board reunion can sometimes be a wistful affair.""But sometimes, just sometimes, you come across something - even just a feeling - that takes you back to how it used to be,"" he said. ""It's almost impossible to put your finger on, but it is definitely there."""

5,DIVORCE,Five Reasons To Have A Rebound Relationship Right Now,"Jennifer Nagy, Contributor
Divorce & Relationship Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/five-reasons-to-have-a-re_us_5b9c389ee4b03a1dcc7d347f,"Unlike many other divorce and relationship experts, I don't believe that it's necessary to abstain from all relationships until you have emotionally recovered from your divorce. Instead, I recommend that divorcees jump headfirst into a rebound relationship.",2012-09-05,Gorgeous young woman smiling while sitting together with her boyfriend at a cafe,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c389e250000350035fc28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Unlike many other divorce and relationship experts, I don't believe that it's necessary to abstain from all relationships until you have emotionally recovered from your divorce. Instead, I recommend that divorcees jump headfirst into a rebound relationship. Before you disagree with my statement, it's important to recognize that I am using the word ""relationship"" loosely in this recommendation. I am in no way implying that divorcees should jump into committed, long-term, monogamous relationships. In my definition, rebound relationships could take many forms: a monogamous relationship between two people who agree that it won't be long-term, or for others, many short-term non-monogamous relationships. In short, the only requirement in my mind for a ""relationship"" to qualify as a rebound is the lack of intent to create a long-term, lasting partnership. So without further ado, here are my five (very convincing!) reasons to have a rebound relationship right now.5. You're probably not ready for a real long-term, committed relationship.  I have spoken to many people mid-divorce who have already chosen (in their own minds or otherwise) a new dating partner before their papers are even signed. They believe that as soon as their divorce is finalized, they will be ready to move onto a new long-term, committed, healthy relationship. I can tell you that even though you may want a rebound relationship to be something real with long-term potential, it very rarely will be. Trust me, I've tried on multiple occasions and it never ends well. Before entering into another long-term relationship, it's important to take time to figure out what went wrong in your marriage and how you can address and prevent those issues in future relationships. Divorcees need to go through the very painful healing process. Before the healing is well underway, most people will not be able to commit properly to another person and a new relationship; hence, my suggestion to enjoy a rebound relationship, which offers fun, companionship and excitement, without the long-term commitment. 4. It's fun. Enough said. 3. It can make the transition between marriage and single life easier. There is a big caveat with this reason: rebound relationships are only healthy if both parties go into the relationship knowing exactly the boundaries and intent of the relationship. This is the only way for a rebound relationship to be healthy and productive for both the divorcee and the new partner. Assuming that this is condition is met, rebound relationships can be very effective ways to find the comfort, intimacy and social life that many divorcees are looking for after their marriage ends. Rebound relationships can give you a much-needed confidence boost and can help you feel hopeful for the possibility of a new relationship in the future. 2. It gives you the opportunity to figure out what type of partner you really want in your next relationship.  The best way to figure out what you want in a relationship is to figure out what you don't want. By casually dating many different types of people, you get the opportunity to try out different character traits and personality types to see how compatible you are together. A rebound relationship is like trying on a pair of shoes or test driving a new car: you get to try out the item risk-free for a limited period of time. My recommendation is to start by looking for someone who is the opposite of your ex. Figure out what personality traits or issues you had as a couple and look for someone who will give you the opportunity to experience something different. For example, if you and your husband/wife argued all the time because of difference in spending habits, then try to find a rebound relationship prospect that feels the same way as you do about spending. By spending time with this person, you'll get the opportunity to really find out if that quality is a deal-breaker for you in your next relationship. 1. Once in a blue moon, a rebound relationship can turn into a real, long-term, committed relationship.  Although I was quick to state that rebound relationships shouldn't be used as a way to find a new long-term relationship, there is no proof that rebound relationships can't turn into successful rebound marriages in certain cases. A 2006 Princeton University study concluded that ""People quickly entering new relationships after an initial divorce, whether by remarriage or cohabitation followed by remarriage, do not have higher divorce rates"". Again, I want to caution against convincing yourself that every single rebound relationship has potential to become a long-term relationship for two reasons:First, it is important to be aware of all of the stipulations of the Princeton study. The study only examined remarriages, not rebound relationships. Additionally, the average time from divorce to remarriage in the study was five years, which is very different than someone whose divorce was just finalized last week. Secondly, if you are hoping to find a rebound relationship that will become a long-term relationship and, eventually, a rebound marriage, then you probably aren't ready to jump into a rebound relationship at all. To fully appreciate and enjoy a rebound relationship, you need to first be able to accept it for what it is, completely without hope that it will progress or become something more meaningful. With all of this being said, I do strongly suggest that divorcees spend time feeling their feelings, figuring out what went wrong in their last relationship and what they need to do to make their next relationship more successful. Self-healing is important. But who says that you can't have some harmless fun in the meantime?"

(https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/selfcheckout)""All of the effort is to speed your way through the checkout so that we can reduce costs and improve the shopping experience,"" said Paul Weitzel, managing partner at retail consulting firm Willard Bishop, who said he had not seen Walmart's test. ""With smartphones and improved technology we're only going to see more of this.""The test comes months after Walmart said that it would add more self-checkout lanes at its Walmart and Sam's Club stores as it continues to look for ways to lower costs and prices for its shoppers.Pushing more shoppers to scan their own items and make payments without the help of a cashier could save Walmart millions of dollars, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on March 7. Wal-Mart says it can save $12 million a year for every second it can cut from the average checkout time at the Walmart chain in the United States.Shoppers often complain on Twitter and in other forums that it takes too long to pay at Walmart, where sometimes only a few of the several checkout lanes are open and staffed with cashiers. While some retailers employ baggers to speed up the checkout process, at Walmart one employee scans and bags items.""We're continually testing new and innovative ways to serve customers and enhance the shopping experience in our stores,"" said Walmart spokesman David Tovar.Walmart's iPhone app already includes functions such as letting shoppers create lists and seeing which items are in stock.The test comes as retailers and restaurants are trying to figure out ways to speed up the checkout process by letting customers pay with a tap of their smartphones.In the Walmart iPhone scanning test, shoppers can scan products with their phone and put them in bags while they shop, and then pay at a self-checkout counter.The test does not allow users to pay on their phone. The app transfers the scanned items to the self-checkout kiosk and then shoppers complete the transaction using the normal self-checkout process.Walmart declined to give details on where the test might lead, but it could conceivably allow for scanning on other smart phones and be paired with mobile payment.Walmart earlier this month said it was joining with other retailers to develop a mobile payment network, a retailer-led initiative that would match similar services by Google Inc and eBay Inc, among others.While self-checkout aisles are common at many stores, the ability to scan items with one's mobile phone while shopping is not a typical process. Among other tests, Supervalu Inc's Jewel-Osco chain once let shoppers use handheld scanners and then enter that information at the checkout to pay, but that test ended years ago.""This is probably the fourth technology that we've tried between shopping carts, RFID chips, the handheld scanners and now we've got smartphones,"" Weitzel said of the retail industry. ""We're looking for ways to improve that experience as an industry.""Walmart's test appears to be limited to one store, but it appears that the company sought out participants beyond its staff for its study. The company asked employees to reach out to friends and family in its search for participants, according to a copy of an email sent by the company's @WalmartLabs team and obtained by Reuters.

You might have been on vacation this summer and fall is often thought of as a time to get back to normal.For some people, summer is also time to take a vacation from paying attention to credit. That hot new bikini and those fabulous flip-flops are easily put on your credit card. But now that fall is here and we're getting back to normal, it's time to pay attention to your credit again.If you're wondering how to improve your credit this fall, one way is to master the 5 factors that ""feed"" your FICO score.Your payment history accounts for up to 35 percent of your credit score. What can you do this fall to improve how promptly you pay your bills on time? Consider automated payments that come directly out of your bank account or even just an ""old school"" wall calendar that marks the payment due dates each month.Your balances owed accounts for up to 30 percent of your credit score. What can you do this fall to improve your balances owed? You should aim to bring your amounts owed on credit cards down to 20 percent of the high credit limit. Consider doing a short-term ""pay-down-my-credit-cards"" challenge to achieve that goal this fall.Length of credit history accounts for up to 15 percent of your credit score. What can you do this fall to improve your length of credit history? This one is easy! Just keep your accounts active by making sure that you have used all of your credit cards periodically, and, don't cancel unused accounts.New credit accounts for up to 10 percent of your credit score. What can you do this fall to improve this aspect of your credit score? One thing to do is to temporarily cut out all inquiries for the entire season (don't apply for new credit cards, car loans, mortgages, etc.) to potentially improve your score with a few months of no inquiries.Types of credit accounts for up to 10 percent of your credit score. What can you do this fall to improve the types of credit you have? First, make sure you have a variety of credit types (revolving loans, such as credit cards; and installment loans, such as a mortgage or car loan). If you don't, then consider ""breaking"" the above rule (about no new credit) and get yourself a new type of loan.Summer is nearly over and for many households, that means everything ""goes back to normal."" My daughter goes back to school and routine starts all over again. If your credit score has taken a summer vacation, it's time to make some commitments to yourself to make some changes there, too.

I filled him in on some current events. (There are 7,458 residents of Banff who, I guess, are either too bewitched or bored by the beauty there to bother about world events.) I shared some headlines and studied his take. He was surprised -- only he wasn't -- to hear that Al and Tipper had called it quits. He was a realist about relationships, he said. ""Bill and Hilary are a sound political partnership -- and that's not the same as a marriage,"" he said. Not exactly original, I thought, yet probably true. Our first date was set for a Friday at a steak place downtown. My first meet and greet of my virtual dating career. I began my preparations two hours before date time and in a hot bath. After, I applied an array of creams to the various terrains of my body. Since it was a special occasion, I powdered my torso also. Then came the hard part: dressing myself. Online dating sites instruct you to ""Come as Yourself."" What woman does that? To me, that seems simplistic, confusing -- and, as a matter of fact, absurd. I mean, what does that mean? Which self?I had neither experience or a concept; my methodology was to try on everything I own and assess each option on its individual merit.I brought out and tried on the DKNY, the DVF, the CK and the J. Crew. The MaxMara and the Elie Tahari. I pulled on pants and skirts. Dresses and suits. Cotton and silk. Flowing things, tailored things, tight things. I tried on risqué and reserved, alluring and austere. An hour to date time and I was having an existential crisis -- of the closet variety. As I pulled outfits from my closet, my repository of selves, all of my eras, looks and moods confronted me at once. They all wanted to go to lunch! I pulled and zipped, buttoned and snapped, pulled on and flung off, groveled in the hamper, laundry basket and in the pit of my closet for other options all the while I dearly, pitifully wished I was the type of woman who knew herself. The type you read about in magazines. A woman with mastery over her body and her closet -- who had, perhaps, some Anne Fontaine shirts, satin and silk blouses, an array of T-shirts, turtle necks and white button downs, a dozen or so shoe options -- sandal, spectator, flat and fuck mes, sling-backs and mules, Puma, Converse, Nike and Ugg -- and five perfect pairs of jeans -- boot, bell, skinny, glitzy and faded 501s - all of which fit. I hated dating. As I wrestled and wiggled, pulled on and flung off I longed to be someone else. With extra-vigilance I tried not to allow this to devolve into a Zoom Moment. I tried not to ask myself How the hell did I get here? Or, worse: Why was I mid-life and dating?   Then, suddenly, I was ready. I thought I looked good -- or, as good as I could. I had on a navy Favourbrook pantsuit. I had bought it five years before. Then, the top was loose, now it was fitted. After this ordeal, I wanted nothing more than to close the curtains, climb fully dressed under the covers and reward myself with a nap. I didn't. I took a picture of myself. For my sisters. One has been married for twenty years; she thinks mid-life dating would be an adventure and fun. The other is a widow and has not dated much, since her husband died.I found my keys and my bag.  My house was in total turmoil. A layer of separates was strewn over every surface. Unchosen shoes littered the floors. My bathroom looked as if an aging Goldilocks had paid a visit, opened and sampled each and every cream and then left them lidless, topless and without their caps. It took me two hours to get dressed. It would take me at least that to clean up after myself. I looked over my shoulder and sighed. It is amazing what a mess I made to appear put together. ****"

Beatie is a transgender male who preserved his female reproductive organs and gained media attention after publicly announcing his pregnancy in 2007. After three children, Beatie wants a fourth. This time, he is hoping his new girlfriend, Amber Nicholas, will carry the child. His ex, Nancy, was unable to get pregnant because she underwent a hysterectomy 25 years ago, People notes. “Being pregnant was the most ­incredible experience, but we want Amber to do it this time around,” he told the Mirror. “I think it would be amazing to experience ­pregnancy as the father.”However, if Amber, who has two children from a previous marriage, cannot get pregnant, he will gladly step in. “It’s even ­possible we could both be pregnant at the same time,"" Beatie, who lives in Arizona, told the Mirror. ""Amber suggested we both try to get pregnant and ­whoever gets there first goes through with it. My surgeon has advised against me getting pregnant because it would be a lot ­harder now I’m ­biologically a man. I would have to have a ­caesarian, but I’d willingly do it to have ­another bundle of joy.”Beatie gained international attention during his first pregnancy when he posted photos of himself shirtless with a beard and a pregnant belly. ""The first doctor we approached was a reproductive endocrinologist. He was shocked by our situation and told me to shave my facial hair,"" he wrote for The Advocate in 2008 while pregnant with his first daughter. Adding, ""A few months and a couple thousand dollars later, he told us that he would no longer treat us, saying he and his staff felt uncomfortable working with 'someone like me.'""After medical complications, Beatie gave birth to baby girl, Susan, in 2008. ""How does it feel to be a pregnant man? Incredible,"" he wrote for The Advocate that year. ""Despite the fact that my belly is growing with a new life inside me, I am stable and confident being the man that I am. In a technical sense I see myself as my own surrogate, though my gender identity as male is constant."" Currently, Beatie is in the process of divorcing Nancy. However, an Arizona judge has halted the proceedings in order to check the validity of the marriage. The judge has reportedly deemed the couple's union a same-sex marriage, which is not legal in Arizona. Although Beatie was legally a male before the wedding, the judge has argued that there is no legal precedent that defines a man as someone who can get pregnant and give birth, TMZ reports. "

In case you don't remember back that far, here's a short refresher: In September 2008, George W. Bush was president. Senator John McCain accepted the Republican presidential nomination a mere three days after vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's 17-year-old daughter Bristol revealed she was pregnant. On September 15, 2008, a gallon of gas cost an average of $3.84, according to Consumer Reports. The unemployment rate spiked, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the Fed agreed to bail out AIG, and the stock market crumbled. But what did all of this mean for you?
