If the Cleveland Cavaliers can win one of their final two games against the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference Finals, Jones will become one of just two players in the modern era to reach six straight NBA Finals, four times with the Miami Heat (2011-2014) and twice with the Cleveland Cavaliers (2015-2016). The only NBA players before him and his teammate to do so were members of the 1960s Boston Celtics, who unlike Jones, benefitted from playing at a time when the Eastern Conference only had four teams. Throughout his career, Jones has gained the respect of his peers for his intelligence, character and, of course, his remarkable three-point shooting. While many words have been wasted on his Western Conference equivalent, Stephen Curry, Jones has continued to make teammates go wild with his abilities from deep, as he did during a recent December blowout against the Orlando Magic.A lifetime 39.8 percent shooter from three, Jones has maintained averages of 5.4 points, 1.9 points and 0.3 assists per game during his 13 seasons in the league, never giving up, never surrendering. Late last year, his teammate and sidekick, LeBron James, praised Jones for what has been an undeniably remarkable and amazing career. ""He's the greatest teammate I've ever had,"" said LeBron, who coincidentally is the only other player since the 1960s to make it to six straight NBA Finals -- all of them, of course, with Jones, an NBA legend that we are all lucky to have witnessed.

He kicks and punches the air during the night -- and sometimes hits at his wife, one time bruising her face. What's the diagnosis?If TSD is accepted as a standalone condition, its diagnosis would still be complicated. Veterans suffer from a host of sleep disorders, so it can be tough to disentangle the symptoms of one from the other. For instance, they're four times as likely as other Americans to suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. Plus, many patients never realize they have TSD, since it happens during sleep, Mysliwiec said. Spouses have generated a lot of his referrals. So single veterans may never realize they have a problem."
2,POLITICS,Why Goldman Sachs Likes Obama's Trade Agenda,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/goldman-sachs-obama-trade-deal_us_57461685e4b03ede4413c33f,Corporate life is so much easier without government regulations.,2016-05-26,"Lloyd Blankfein, CEO and Chairman of Goldman Sachs, on January 7, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574617b5130000d605382c54.jpeg?cache=eL9a4Mr8v1&ops=crop_29_0_2971_1983%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was right. Big banks really did want President Barack Obama to sign a trade deal making it easier for them to challenge regulations they don't like. And they got what they wanted.Goldman Sachs believed that any trade pact that did not include terms to help it challenge rules would not be ""a meaningful agreement for our industry,"" according to a private email from the bank's managing director, Faryar Shirzad, to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman.The note is one of a handful of emails obtained by the progressive group Rootstrikers through a Freedom Of Information Act request and provided to The Huffington Post. Rootstrikers sought direct communications between Froman -- formerly a high-paid Citigroup employee -- and big banks. The emails do not demonstrate any legally damning coordination between Froman and Wall Street, but they do reveal new details about bank lobbying on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a major trade pact between the United States and 11 other countries.Froman was so irked by a November Politico Pro article detailing big bank objections to the pact that he forwarded the article to a JPMorgan Chase staffer with an admonishment: ""This is really not helpful."" The name of the JPMorgan Chase employee was redacted from the email.Although Congress has yet to approve TPP, Obama has already signed the agreement. Last year, Congress passed so-called ""fast track"" legislation, making it easier for Obama and the next U.S. president to move trade pacts through the legislature.The TPP deal grants corporations broad powers to challenge government regulations before an international tribunal, a process known as investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS. Under the pact, if a U.S. company doesn't like rules in Vietnam, Chile or other countries involved in the deal, it can challenge that country's policies before an ISDS panel. Foreign corporations are free to challenge U.S. laws before the same court. ISDS is not new, but it has become an increasingly popular venue for corporate challenges to regulatory standards. As Warren noted in a Washington Post op-ed last year, corporations initiated fewer than 100 ISDS cases between 1959 and 2002, but filed 58 in 2012 alone.Goldman Sachs was particularly keen on securing the right for banks to challenge regulations before ISDS courts on the grounds that they don't meet a ""minimum standard of treatment."" This metric is extremely flexible and not explicitly defined -- what exactly constitutes a ""minimum standard of treatment"" is essentially left up to ISDS courts to determine on a case-by-case basis. ""I wanted to underscore how important it is for the financial services industry to get robust commitments on the ISDS in the agreement -- including on pre-establishment and the full range of fair treatment (MST, NT, MFN) provisions,"" Shirzad wrote Froman in a November 2013 email. ""These measures are critical to making the TPP a meaningful agreement for our industry and, as importantly, they set a powerful precedent for the US -China BIT [Bilateral Investment Treaty].""Prior to TPP, the financial services sector never had so much leeway to file ISDS cases. And while TPP is unlikely to affect domestic financial standards, the precedent it sets could prove more troubling to financial reform advocates, particularly if similar terms are adopted under the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP -- a deal between the United States and the European Union that focuses on regulatory policies. Multiple E.U. governments have been hostile to financial reform standards the United States implemented in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Robust ISDS terms in TTIP could ultimately allow foreign banks like HSBC, Deutsche Bank or Credit Suisse to undermine American banking rules.""For banking issues, based on everything we've seen, TTIP is the place where we are going to be worried,"" former IMF Chief Economist Simon Johnson told HuffPost. ""Any effort to put financial services into TTIP along the lines of what's been proposed -- that would be a mistake.""Shirzad's email to Froman reflects the high priority Goldman Sachs places on trade issues. Shirzad is the bank's top government liaison in the nation's capital. He references ""Esta's earlier call"" to Froman in the note -- an apparent reference to Esta Stecher, a longtime Goldman Sachs executive who carries significant clout with the bank.""There is nothing surprising or controversial about seeking basic protections of transparency and fair treatment for U.S. investors abroad so that American exporters of goods and services operate on a level playing field,"" Goldman Sachs spokesman Andrew Williams said in a statement provided to HuffPost. ""These are the same protections that the United States provides foreign investors here at home so it is common sense that American companies would want the same treatment abroad. TPP remains controversial in Congress. Obama and Congressional Republicans had enough votes to pass the deal when the fast-track vote succeeded last year, but lawmakers have blocked a vote to approve it since negotiations concluded. TPP supporters hope the legislature will approve the pact in a lame-duck session after the November elections."
3,POLITICS,Republicans Kill Spending Bill Over Its LGBT Protections,Jennifer Bendery and Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-republicans-lgbt-discrimination_us_574673e5e4b03ede4413e039,Some couldn't accept a provision that prevents government contractors from firing people for being gay.,2016-05-26,Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) added language to a spending bill to ensure that contractors can't fire people for being gay. Conservatives freaked out!,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57467a1c12000025008948a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans unexpectedly sunk their own $37.4 billion water and energy spending bill on Thursday because it included a provision ensuring that people who work for government contractors can't be fired for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.The bill failed 112 to 305, with 130 Republicans and 175 Democrats opposing it.Nearly every Democrat voted against it, but that was expected. They'd raised concerns with riders in the bill that would undermine the Clean Water Act and allow people to carry firearms on Corps of Engineers lands. They also opposed language added late Wednesday by Republicans that would prevent the federal government from revoking funds to North Carolina over its controversial law affecting transgender people going to the bathroom.The real surprise was seeing conservatives line up against the bill over an amendment added late Wednesday by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.). His provision would preserve a 2014 executive order by President Barack Obama that bars federal contractors from discriminating against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The House accepted his amendment 223 to 195, with moderate Republicans joining with Democrats to pass it.Lawmakers fought over a similar LGBT amendment last week when Maloney unsuccessfully tried to attach it to a military spending bill. He had the votes to pass it at one point, but GOP leaders held the voting open after the clock ran out, and strong-armed just enough Republicans to switch their votes and bring it down. That sent the chamber into chaos, with Democrats shouting, ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" at GOP lawmakers who changed their votes.So it was already a sensitive issue when Maloney's amendment came back up Wednesday night. Politico reported that as Republicans huddled Thursday morning before the vote, Rep. Rick Allen (R-Ga.) read aloud a passage from the Bible and asked people if they were prepared to violate their religious principles by supporting the bill. That didn't sit well with some in the room.""Many members were visibly disturbed by the comments,"" a GOP source in the room, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Huffington Post. ""At least one walked out.""Beyond that, the conservative Heritage Foundation announced Thursday morning that it opposed the bill over Maloney's amendment and vowed to include it as a key vote on its legislative scorecard -- a public record of how conservative each lawmaker ranks. That drove scores of GOP lawmakers to oppose the legislation.""House Republicans' thirst to discriminate against the LGBT community is so strong that they are willing to vote down their own appropriations bill in order to prevent progress over bigotry,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), meanwhile, blamed Democrats for killing the bill.""What we learned today is that Democrats were not looking to advance an issue but to sabotage the appropriations process,"" he told reporters. ""The mere fact that they voted to pass the [Maloney] amendment and then voted against the bill containing their amendment proves this point.""The House is about to head into a weeklong recess, which means they'll revisit the bill when they come back in mid-June. Ryan said to expect ""a family discussion"" when they return, and noted that his vow to maintain an open amendment process on bills means there will be more unpredictability.""Some bills might fail because we're not going to tightly control the process and pre-determine the outcome of everything around here,"" Ryan said. ""Well, that happened today."""
4,POLITICS,Here's A Pro Tip For Katie Couric Before She Does Another Documentary,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/katie-couric-under-the-gun_us_5747245de4b0dacf7ad42f59,Don't delete arguments you solicit.,2016-05-26,"Katie Couric attends the premiere of ""Under The Gun"" in Los Angeles on May 3, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let us begin with a stipulation: Documentaries, no matter how artful their sheen of objectivity is, are by their very nature biased. And that's okay. We accept that documentary features obtain their relevance because of a singular editorial focus: an argument that must be heard by someone who feels powerfully obliged to make that argument.We can live with this because documentary artists promise us something in return: toughness. As a viewer, we want to be assured that the people behind the documentary have undertaken an intellectually rigorous effort to assure that their end product isn't weak and naive. We need to be able to accept as a given that the documentary's creators are forthrightly doing battle in the marketplace of ideas, that they understand the necessity of posing a compelling argument, and that they accept the fact that someone could come along the next week and out-argue them. It's pretty clear that ""Under The Gun"" -- the Katie Couric executive-produced film that seeks to ""[examine] the events and people who have kept the gun debate fierce and the progress slow"" -- has failed the test of toughness. This is pretty bad news for people who feel that the gun debate has been fierce and the progress slow!As you may have heard by now, ""Under The Gun"" features a scene that's altogether startling in its intellectual dishonesty. About 22 minutes into the movie, in an interview session with members of a gun rights group called the Virginia Citizens Defense League, Couric poses this question: “If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?”There is nothing untoward, of course, about asking tough questions in interviews -- even ones that are colored by the tinge of ""gotcha."" Anyone who's watched a Sunday Morning politics show knows that this is basically their stock-in-trade. But when Chuck Todd poses this sort of question on ""Meet The Press,"" the cameras keep rolling, and we watch his interviewee contend with the inquiry.At this moment in ""Under The Gun,"" it appears as if the documentarians' cameras do the same -- capturing the members of this group silent, perplexed, and unable to respond to the inquiry. But here's an exciting twist: It turns out that this is all bullshit!Raw audio, provided by the Virginia Citizens Defense League to the Washington Free Beacon's Stephen Gutowski, reveals that what happened in that moment is not the damning, embarrassing silence that the documentary depicts. Rather, it reveals that the group immediately attempted to grapple with the question. As The Washington Post's Erik Wemple chronicles, the filmmakers -- essentially caught red-handed -- have offered up a range of half-hearted apologies and not-to-be believed excuses. Here's ""Under The Gun"" co-producer and director Stephanie Soechtig:There are a wide range of views expressed in the film. My intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans’ opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way.So, let me get this straight. The filmmakers actively sought out a ""range of views."" Then they actively decided, for whatever reason, that it might be nice for viewers ""to have a moment to consider this important question."" And then, I guess the documentarians' cameras and editing bay became self-aware somehow, seizing control of the production and fashioning a false moment from this exchange. Soechtig, suddenly and strangely suggesting that she has only intermittent agency over her own creation, says that she ""never intended to make anyone look bad."" Sure hope she's able to finger the real culprit, then! This shift, between active and passive, is proof enough that the documentarians failed to meet the toughness standard. But here is where I'm puzzled: Why did the filmmakers seek out these people's opinions if they never intended to include them? There are a multitude of ways to present the idea that the ""gun debate"" has been ""fierce and the progress slow."" These filmmakers chose to take their argument to the Virginia Citizens Defense League. It was their decision to get into the arena. And then it was their decision to erase the competition that they had enjoined.I can't speak to the filmmakers' mindset. You can listen to the interview for yourself, and be just as perplexed as me about why this exchange was deemed to be not fit for inclusion, or why it shook the foundations of their premise so badly. Understanding that you are going to be confronted with an argument that might not support your thesis -- and with which you may have to grapple with to continue -- is the sort of thing you're supposed to steel yourself for before you make a documentary. You don't reveal truths or win debates by erasing other ideas from memory.The end result here is a documentary that does a great disservice to its audience, arming viewers with the false assurance that a tough question didn't receive an answer, when in fact it did. This film's audience has been denied the opportunity to wrestle with those answers -- a promise the film explicitly makes when it shows Couric engaging with the members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League in the first place. The filmmakers' weaknesses have been thus passed along to their viewers. If you invite an argument, contend with the argument.

But securing the necessary delegates effectively ends Trump's primary campaign, in which he outlasted 16 other Republicans seeking the nomination.Republicans are expected to finalize their pick when delegates vote during the July 18-21 convention in Cleveland.Trump would face either former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who are vying for the Democratic nomination.

The 30-year-old ""Danish Girl"" actress cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split, which comes after only 15 months of marriage. Heard filed the divorce petition on Monday, May 23, just days after Depp's mother died.On Thursday, the actress was reportedly spotted shopping at Tiffany's after legal documents showed she was filing for spousal support from her 52-year-old husband. Depp filed a motion to deny her request the day before, according to legal documents seen by The Huffington Post. Sources tell TMZ that the couple had no prenuptial agreement, but this shouldn't prove too much of a disaster for Depp's reported $400 million fortune. According to California's ""community property"" rule, the couple will most likely end up splitting whatever earnings they made while they were married and will keep the earnings they made before they tied the knot.There are multiple rumors floating around as to why the couple split. Sources told TMZ that Depp's family wasn't fond of Heard, including Depp's late mother. Others allege it was the actress' terrible temper, which Heard herself talked about in a 2014 interview with W magazine. “Whenever my old friends meet someone I’m involved with romantically, they immediately warn them: 'She may look refined, but when she’s angry, she can go trailer park really fast,'"" Heard said. ""But I'd always rather be passionate than bland. I can’t imagine living a quiet life."" One thing is for sure: this divorce doesn't seem like it'll be quiet. Though you might still be mourning the end of the couple's marriage, at least their horrendous dog apology video will live on forever: CORRECTION: A previous version of this post misstated how California's community property rule works.

7,PARENTS,How Zika Is Making Couples Question Their Pregnancy Timelines,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-zika-is-making-couples-question-their-pregnancy-timelines_us_5745bcc1e4b055bb1170c814,"""In the U.S., the risk for mosquito-borne illness is relatively small.""",2016-05-26,The threat of Zika virus is changing some family planning decisions. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745be7c130000d605382b7c.jpeg?cache=dW5rxMqDyD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like many women, Claire, 31, is not totally certain when she wants to start trying for another baby. She has a 6-year-old from a previous marriage, and a 5-month-old with her current husband. They would like at least a two year gap between their youngest and another baby, so they're not pulling double diaper duty.But at the same time, Claire has begun questioning whether she should move up her timeline due to Zika, the disease that can lead to birth defects like microcephaly -- and that might soon be more of an issue in the United States.""We're not totally sure how we want to deal with it yet, since Zika isn't fully understood,"" said Claire, who currently lives in Indiana but is planning on a move to the South. ""We tentatively talked about moving the conception of another child up, before things really take off with the virus this summer, but we're not really in a position to have another child right now.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently monitoring nearly 300 pregnant women in the United States and its territories who have tested positive for Zika. To date, there has not been a single case of the virus that has been contracted in this country (that is not true of Puerto Rico), but many experts believe it's only a matter of time before there are pockets of the disease that originate here. All of which means that many women and their partners have begun to grapple with the possibility of Zika, and whether it means they should change their plans for pregnancy in any way. ""My husband and I have always wanted to have children who are two to three years apart,"" said Samantha*, 30, from Texas. The couple's first child, a girl, is 14 months old, so this is right around when they hoped to start trying. Zika, however, has given her pause.""I'm definitely concerned,"" said Samantha. ""I'm not scared, but I'm also not feeling super gung-ho, like, 'Yes, of course we're going to start trying regardless of the risks.'""Though her husband says he isn't worried at all, Samantha has thought about postponing trying for a year or two, at least until scientists understand more about the disease and how much of an issue it will ultimately become in the United States. Things are potentially even more difficult for families who have been trying, unsuccessfully, to get pregnant for months or years, and who feel they simply cannot wait, no matter the potential risk. Lauren, 36, has a 6-year-old and has been trying for two years to have a second child. She has had two miscarriages and she and her husband have gone to a reproductive endocrinologist, though they are not currently undergoing fertility treatment.""I thought about [putting things on hold],"" she said. ""My sister and sister-in-law are both medical professionals, and they both want to have another baby. One of them is moving forward and trying for another one, and one is not.""""If I were younger, I would probably hold off on having a baby,"" Lauren added. ""I would also hold off if they were close to coming out with a vaccine. My main reason for moving forward is that I don't feel like I have the luxury of time at my age.""A major challenge faced by women and couples grappling with such issues is that it's not entirely clear to experts how much of an issue Zika might be in the United States (a large outbreak seems highly unlikely), or how long men and women should wait before trying to conceive if they've been exposed to the virus. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says that women who have symptoms of Zika should wait for eight weeks before attempting reproduction. For men, it's six months. Anyone possibly exposed to the virus, but not showing symptoms, should also wait eight weeks. But as Ali Watkins, a Buzzfeed correspondent, detailed in her first-person account of being infected the virus in Mexico, the fact that experts are still scrambling to understand Zika means that advice can be contradictory.""My doctor told me if I do indeed test positive for Zika, I shouldn’t get pregnant for three years,"" she wrote. ""The CDC, meanwhile, said I would have to wait only eight weeks. How long did the disease stay in my system? Not sure, and scientists don’t even know yet.""The good news for men and women in the United States is that while there are certainly no guarantees, not one medical group has said it's necessary for potential parents-to-be who haven't been exposed to the virus elsewhere or by a sexual partner to hold off on trying to conceive. That's very different than the situation in countries that have been hit hard by the virus and where health officials are desperately torn about what to tell women, in many cases urging them simply to wait. ""Basically, the situation is that at this point there’s very little risk right now of being affected by a mosquito,"" said Dr. James Segars, chair of the ASRM’s Zika working group. ""In the U.S., the risk for mosquito-borne illness is relatively small, if not negligible, as long as [a person is] working primarily inside and uses precautions,"" he added.That is Samantha's game plan. Though she thought, momentarily, about putting her pregnancy plans on hold, a large age gap between children is simply not what she had envisioned for her family, so she has gone off the pill.Claire is going a different route. She and her husband aren't actively trying at the moment, and they may not necessarily start before they move down South. In that case, given the higher temperatures and humidity that make that area a fertile ground for mosquitoes, she says it feels right for them to wait.""At this point, we feel that if we don't have another child up here in Indiana, then we should just wait until a vaccine is developed for Zika,"" she said.Like most things when it comes to family planning decisions, it's complicated. * Name has been changed to protect anonymity"

Their work was published Thursday in the science journal Proceedings Of the Royal Society B.Scientists tested dung from 10 cows. Five of the cows received a three-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotic tetracycline, and five received none, Phys.org reports. Researchers then measured the dung's outputs of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and found that the antibiotic course “consistently increased methane emissions.” Right now, the researchers aren’t sure exactly why the antibiotics have this effect. Scientists also found that the antibiotics changed the types of microorganisms living within dung beetles that fed on the dung. That finding is important because it indicates that giving livestock antibiotics can affect other wildlife and not just the ""target animal,"" lead author Tobin Hammer told The Huffington Post in an email.“In this case, dung beetle size and numbers were not affected -- which is good, because these beetles are ecologically important,” Hammer said. However, it’s possible the drugs could influence the beetles in other ways that researchers didn’t examine, like behavior. He added that more work is needed to determine the various ways that different types of antibiotics could affect different animal species. The new research comes after decades of experts warning that mass antibiotic use in livestock can and does lead to “superbugs” — bacteria that are totally resistant to antibiotics. As early as 1976, a Tufts University researcher found that when chickens received tetracycline, both the chickens and the farm workers handling them developed tetracycline-resistant bacteria within only a week.One reason antibiotics are such a problem in livestock is because some farmers don’t just using them to treat individual sick animals. They also routinely give large numbers of animals low doses of antibiotics in an attempt to keep them from getting sick in the first place.And some farmers also use antibiotics “subtherapeutically,” meaning that they give all their animals low doses of antibiotics because doing so makes the animals grow faster. (It's not totally clear why this works.) The FDA is in the process of phasing out the use of “medically important” drugs for this purpose in the United States. However, the overuse of antibiotics in livestock worldwide is rising as countries like China shift to more large-scale farms.And while superbugs are the primary reason people have traditionally been concerned about antibiotic overuse, the issue of antibiotics is also linked to animal welfare.“Many of these antibiotics are regularly used on animals that are not sick in order to speed up their growth or to prevent disease caused by overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions,” Rebecca Spector of the Center for Food Safety told Modern Farmer.In other words, the reason these animals are so susceptible to illness in the first place is because they live in intensively confined, dirty, and highly stressful environments.Correction: A previous version of this article said dung from antibiotic-fed cows gave off more than double the amount of methane. It was actually slightly less than double the amount."

Rob Bishop (R-Utah.), left, and the committee's ranking member Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), right, listen to testimony on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, April 13, 2016, during a legislative hearing on a discussion draft of the ""Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Legislation giving Puerto Rico the ability to restructure its $70 billion in debt overcame a major hurdle on Thursday, passing out of committee in the House.The House Natural Resources Committee approved the bill, which would establish an oversight board to help the commonwealth restructure its un-payable debt and craft an economic recovery plan, in a 29-10 vote.It’s a significant step for proponents of the bill, who had to write multiple versions of the legislation and abruptly cancel the first markup scheduled last month. The bill will now advance to the House floor. “Congress has sown the wind, and Puerto Rico has reaped the whirlwind,” Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), chair of the committee, said in his opening statement. “This bill is Puerto Rico’s last and best chance to get on sound financial footing and put its economy on the path to recovery and prosperity.”The passage out of committee comes after Bishop and Republican leaders worked for months to make the bill palatable for conservatives in their ranks, Democrats and the administration. It’s a win for Republican leaders attempting to show they can pass critical legislation during a tense election year. Despite supporting the legislation, Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), ranking member on the committee, said he was concerned that the bill strengthened the oversight board’s authority over what is ultimately decided on Puerto Rico’s debt. Still, like a majority of Democrats on the committee, Grijalva backed the bill, citing its ability to allow restructuring and the little time left for the island to crawl its way back from the brink. Puerto Rico faces a critical $2 billion debt payment on July 1 that it will not make unless legislation reaches the president's desk in time. “So here is the bottom line: Puerto Rico is drowning in debt, and H.R. 5278 is a lifeline,” Grijalva said. “This is the only bill that will attract enough support from our colleagues on the Republican side to pass in a Congress they control.”During the three-hour hearing, divisions between the committee's Democratic and conservative members were evident. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) offered an amendment that would require the oversight board to study the health care disparities on the island. It was adopted. Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) offered up a number of amendments attempting to prioritize debt owned by creditors in the restructuring hierarchy, which were struck down. Fleming warned that the bill entered ""uncharted waters"" and said he disagreed with language that would put a stay on litigation against the island's government by bondholders. Under Puerto Rican law, certain debt is constitutionally prioritized over others. But the Treasury Department and Republican leaders like Bishop have argued that the oversight board will institute a more balanced approach during restructuring. The difficulty in striking the delicate balance between Republicans and Democrats was on full display as Bishop began growing tired during the markup and ushering people to move faster on amendments.""Just pass the crap out,"" he said two hours in. While the bill is expected to pass once it reaches the House floor, it remains to be seen if opposition from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and others in the Senate will slow the bill down in the upper chamber."

The crash happened around 1:30 a.m. while the bus was making the 460-mile run from New York to Cleveland. Passengers think the driver fell asleep at the wheel, according to CNN.The media outlet found that Greyhound drivers -- who transport some 18 million passengers a year -- frequently drove for unsafe lengths of time, often through the night.Driver fatigue is linked to 36 percent of all fatal intercity bus crashes, making it the number one cause of such crashes, according to a 2009 study from the U.S. Department of Transportation.Greyhound's rule book states that drivers are supposed to stop every 150 miles (about two to three hours on a highway) to stop, stretch, walk around and check the bus tires. But this is just a guideline, CNN reports, and it's not enforced. A Greyhound spokesperson refused to comment to The Huffington Post due to an ongoing internal investigation. But Greyhound CEO David Leach said in a deposition, obtained by CNN, that drivers were expected to use their ""best judgment"" whether they were too tired to drive. A Huffington Post investigation into the regulation of truck drivers turned up similar problems: Truckers get notoriously little sleep. They have a high risk of obstructive sleep apnea -- about 28 percent, according to one study, compared to two to four percent risk for Americans overall -- and often work very long shifts that mess with their bodies' circadian rhythms. Despite this, the trucking industry has been loath to reform its work schedules for drivers.It remains to be seen how Greyhound and the commercial bus industry will react to CNN's findings. Of course, drowsy driving isn't just an issue for truckers and bus operators. Surveys suggest that millions of Americans have nodded off behind the wheel, and sleepy drivers are linked to 328,000 crashes each year. "

14,MEDIA,Silicon Valley Billionaire Linked To Gawker Lawsuit Once Gave Big To Press Freedom,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-gawker-press-freedom_us_5745cf49e4b055bb1170d60a,PayPal co-founder and Trump booster Peter Thiel gave $1 million to the Committee to Protect Journalists before reportedly helping Hulk Hogan.,2016-05-25,"Billionaire Peter Thiel reportedly funded Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker, which resulted in $140 million in damages. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745dc511600002a00f94730.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel has used his fortune to support press freedom — and possibly suppress it.On Tuesday night, Forbes reported Thiel had secretly funded wrestler Hulk Hogan's invasion of privacy lawsuit against Gawker Media, a case that resulted in $140 million in damages against the media company and raised serious questions about free speech rights. The notion of a secret wealthy benefactor only heightens such concerns. Thiel has not yet commented on reports of his involvement in the Hogan suit and on why he'd bankroll a suit that could potentially put Gawker out of business. A spokesman did not respond to The Huffington Post's request. But Thiel, who made a fortune as co-founder of PayPal and an early backer of Facebook, expressed his distaste for Gawker in the past after Valleywag, its now-shuttered tech gossip blog, outed him before he came out as gay. In May 2009, Thiel likened Valleywag to a terrorist organization, ""the Silicon Valley equivalent of al Qaeda.""Five months later, Thiel seemed more focused on defending digital journalists from threats. It was reported in October 2009 that he gave a ""substantial check"" to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based advocacy organization that defends the press worldwide. ""Technology can have positive and negative aspects,"" Thiel said at the time. ""I want to help the CPJ defend the rights of online journalists.""A CPJ spokesperson told HuffPost that the Thiel Foundation provided $1.075 million to the organization for general support. Thiel's donations included annual grants of $250,000 from 2008 to 2011 and a final $75,000 grant in January 2013. Thiel, a self-described libertarian and one of the more outspoken figures in Silicon Valley, has also emerged as the tech capital's biggest Donald Trump supporter. The presumptive Republican nominee has bullied reporters and boasted of attempts to financially ruin them while pledging to change libel laws if elected president to make news organizations easier targets. So there's a disconnect between Thiel's libertarian streak, his support for a candidate with little regard for the First Amendment, his contributions toward press freedom and his reportedly funding a case that could bankrupt a media company. (Thiel's also an investor in tech site Pando, which didn't hold back Wednesday in criticizing him). Gawker has long argued that publishing a snippet of a sex tape in 2012 involving Hogan (aka Terry Bollea) is protected under the First Amendment, and the company is currently appealing the March decision. The massive jury award, which could be significantly reduced, currently poses an existential threat to Gawker Media, which publishes the flagship news and gossip site and six others.On Monday, Gawker Media chief Nick Denton revealed his suspicion that a financier, with an axe to grind against Gawker, had secretly funded the Hogan suit and others brought against his company. It’s not illegal for a third party to bankroll a lawsuit, but the suggestion of a secret backer added intrigue to an already sensational case.“My own personal hunch is that it’s linked to Silicon Valley, but that’s nothing really more than a hunch,” Denton told The New York Times. “If you’re a billionaire and you don’t like the coverage of you, and you don’t particularly want to embroil yourself any further in a public scandal, it’s a pretty smart, rational thing to fund other legal cases.”Denton didn't identify a suspect and Gawker Media, in a Wednesday statement, didn't mention Thiel by name. But the media company highlighted the billionaire's past support for press freedom: ""A board member of Facebook and a major funder of The Committee to Protect Journalists has been secretly funding a legal campaign against our journalists.""CPJ executive director Joel Simon said in a statement to The Huffington Post that Thiel and Thiel Foundation ""provided significant financial support"" to the press freedom group. ""As a free expression organization, we have a wide variety of supporters with a wide variety of views,"" he added. In response to the reported links between Thiel and the Hogan suit, Simon emphasized that CPJ ""support[s] the right of individuals in the United States and around the world to seek civil redress in case of defamation."" ""However,"" he continued, ""we do not support efforts to abuse the process by seeking to punish or bankrupt particular media outlets.""UPDATE: Thiel told the New York Times Wednesday night that he saw nothing contradictory in giving to CPJ and funding a suit in hopes of putting Gawker out of business. “I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations,” he said. “I think much more highly of journalists than that. It’s precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker.”Huffington Post Media Group President and Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington is on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists."

17,GREEN,ExxonMobil Shareholders Are Starting The Climate War The Oil Giant Deserves,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-mobil-shareholder-meeting_us_57445fa9e4b00e09e89ffa61,Trouble has been brewing for months.,2016-05-25,"ExxonMobil has changed course on how its describes climate change in the last few years, going from downplaying concerns to accepting that it is a serious issue.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745bf221600002a00f946d3.jpeg?ops=crop_0_279_4095_2275%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"ExxonMobil's investors want the company to come clean about how climate change could affect its business.On Wednesday, shareholders will meet in Dallas, Texas. They are scheduled to vote on investor resolutions, including some that would require the energy giant to disclose the risks climate change poses to its bottom line.ExxonMobil investors worth $6 trillion, including the California Public Employee's Retirement System and the Church of England, are backing the resolutions on climate risk. They worry that climate change might hurt the company's operations, and that policies designed to curb global warming could soon make selling fossil fuels a losing game.The largest publicly traded energy company in the world, ExxonMobil has urged shareholders to reject the proposals, saying it already does enough to address climate risk, according to Scott Silvestri, senior media relations adviser at the firm.Indeed, ExxonMobil addressed concerns about climate change in a 2014 risk disclosure statement, which companies are required to file. But proponents of the new resolutions argue that ExxonMobil's past reporting on climate change has been unsatisfactory.Shareholders have considered, and rejected, similar resolutions in the past. Though these latest resolutions are unlikely to pass as well, they could help pressure the company to become more transparent about how planetary warming and climate policy might impact its operations, according to supporters of the proposals. Thanks in part to slumping oil prices and allegations that the company misled the public about its knowledge of climate change, ExxonMobil has been beset for months by public criticism, legal challenges and financial woes that have brought investors' concerns to a boiling point.Wednesday's vote comes amid reports that the company knew about links between fossil fuels and climate change as early as the 1970s.In September 2015, the site InsideClimateNews, along with The Los Angeles Times and the Columbia Journalism School, unearthed documents showing that ExxonMobil had early knowledge of climate change.Numerous reports have since surfaced indicating that ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute, the country’s largest oil and gas lobbying group, spent decades and millions of dollars downplaying the environmental risks posed by burning oil and other fossil fuels.The revelations have hurt investors' confidence in the company, according to Kathy Mulvey, the climate accountability campaign manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists. She has worked with institutional investors to address climate and other risks in the past.""I think what's really shifting things is the evidence that the company decided not to chart a different course based on what it knew and, furthermore, that ExxonMobil embarked decades ago on a coordinated campaign to deceive the public about climate change,"" Mulvey told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ExxonMobil denies that it deliberately withheld information on the links between fossil fuels and climate change, saying it came to no firm conclusions about climate change in the 1970s. However, reports about the extent of its climate knowledge have prompted legal challenges.In November, the New York state attorney general launched an investigation to determine whether the firm misled investors about the risks of climate change. In March, a coalition of state attorneys general announced they had begun similar investigations.The Department of Justice also asked the FBI in March to look into whether ExxonMobil had broken federal racketeering statutes by suppressing information about the links between fossil fuels and climate change. The move recalled past efforts to punish corporate duplicity: Federal prosecutors successfully used the very same statutes to prosecute tobacco companies for willfully misleading the public about the health effects of smoking.Plummeting oil prices have also helped force the company onto the ropes. ExxonMobil has had to dial back new oil exploration projects. And in February, Standard and Poor’s downgraded ExxonMobil's credit rating, a sign that investors might have doubts about the company's ability to continue generating fat returns.Now, the oil giant is facing a reckoning from shareholders. Since January, a group of investors has been calling on the company to provide annual assessments detailing precisely how its business would be affected by global temperature increases and policies designed to slow the planet's warming.The company published a report in 2014 outlining its strategies for dealing with a warming planet and climate policy. But shareholders remain concerned that international efforts to slow climate change by curbing fossil fuel use could hurt ExxonMobil's business model. They say the company has not told investors how its business would perform if global temperature increases were limited to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the warming cap set by the global climate accord adopted by 195 countries in December.Calls for greater transparency at the oil giant reflect a broader trend of investors demanding that companies be more upfront about the risks posed by climate change and climate policy, according to Lance Pierce, president of CDP North America, a nonprofit that tracks corporate disclosures around climate change.""As more and more investors have themselves begun to internalize the projected risks of climate change to their portfolios, they've begun in increasing numbers to make asks of this industry and others about what the impacts are,"" Pierce told HuffPost. ""What we're seeing now is not new, and it's probably not the high water mark either,"" Pierce added. Even if the proposals are not adopted Wednesday, they still could help convince the company's executives that shareholders feel strongly about the issue, according to Mulvey.ExxonMobil has already tempered its public position on climate change. The company's CEO, Rex Tillerson, said as recently as 2012 that fears about climate change were overblown, stoked by environmental groups who “manufacture fear.” Now, the company says it's confronting climate change head on. “We see the issue of climate change, we see the risks of climate change and take them seriously, and we are working hard on lower emissions technology,” Alan T. Jeffers, a company spokesman, told The New York Times last week. For instance, the company has partnered with clean technology firm FuelCell to develop improved carbon capture and storage technologies. Other energy companies are beginning to shift their official position on climate change as well, according to Mulvey. ""The other fossil fuel companies are definitely paying attention,"" Mulvey said. ""The pressure that's rising on ExxonMobil should create a powerful incentive for other companies to distinguish themselves.""Whether public statements about transparency and climate change will translate into action remains difficult to say, according to Kert Davies, executive director of the Climate Investigations Center, a group that monitors environmental policy. ""They're not going to win,"" Davies told HuffPost, referring to shareholders putting climate change resolutions before ExxonMobil. ""But shareholder activists are long haul activists.

The logic is simple: Fossil fuel companies are unlikely to change their basic business model, and it’s too late to try to work with them to clean up their act. These activists advocate divesting from fossil fuel companies altogether. “There’s just no more time for fooling around,"" Bill McKibben, founder of environmental advocacy group 350.org, told reporters on a call Monday.

18,GREEN,ExxonMobil Shareholders Are Starting The Climate War The Oil Giant Deserves,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-mobil-shareholder-meeting_us_57445fa9e4b00e09e89ffa61,Trouble has been brewing for months.,2016-05-25,"Michele Vaughan (L) and Ashlee Whitaker, both of Dallas, protest outside the ExxonMobil annual shareholders' meeting at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center May 28, 2008, in Dallas, Texas. ExxonMobil shareholders will convene Wednesday in Dallas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574494dd1600002a00f9455e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ExxonMobil's investors want the company to come clean about how climate change could affect its business.On Wednesday, shareholders will meet in Dallas, Texas. They are scheduled to vote on investor resolutions, including some that would require the energy giant to disclose the risks climate change poses to its bottom line.ExxonMobil investors worth $6 trillion, including the California Public Employee's Retirement System and the Church of England, are backing the resolutions on climate risk. They worry that climate change might hurt the company's operations, and that policies designed to curb global warming could soon make selling fossil fuels a losing game.The largest publicly traded energy company in the world, ExxonMobil has urged shareholders to reject the proposals, saying it already does enough to address climate risk, according to Scott Silvestri, senior media relations adviser at the firm.Indeed, ExxonMobil addressed concerns about climate change in a 2014 risk disclosure statement, which companies are required to file. But proponents of the new resolutions argue that ExxonMobil's past reporting on climate change has been unsatisfactory.Shareholders have considered, and rejected, similar resolutions in the past. Though these latest resolutions are unlikely to pass as well, they could help pressure the company to become more transparent about how planetary warming and climate policy might impact its operations, according to supporters of the proposals. Thanks in part to slumping oil prices and allegations that the company misled the public about its knowledge of climate change, ExxonMobil has been beset for months by public criticism, legal challenges and financial woes that have brought investors' concerns to a boiling point.Wednesday's vote comes amid reports that the company knew about links between fossil fuels and climate change as early as the 1970s.In September 2015, the site InsideClimateNews, along with The Los Angeles Times and the Columbia Journalism School, unearthed documents showing that ExxonMobil had early knowledge of climate change.Numerous reports have since surfaced indicating that ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute, the country’s largest oil and gas lobbying group, spent decades and millions of dollars downplaying the environmental risks posed by burning oil and other fossil fuels.The revelations have hurt investors' confidence in the company, according to Kathy Mulvey, the climate accountability campaign manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists. She has worked with institutional investors to address climate and other risks in the past.""I think what's really shifting things is the evidence that the company decided not to chart a different course based on what it knew and, furthermore, that ExxonMobil embarked decades ago on a coordinated campaign to deceive the public about climate change,"" Mulvey told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ExxonMobil denies that it deliberately withheld information on the links between fossil fuels and climate change, saying it came to no firm conclusions about climate change in the 1970s. However, reports about the extent of its climate knowledge have prompted legal challenges.In November, the New York state attorney general launched an investigation to determine whether the firm misled investors about the risks of climate change. In March, a coalition of state attorneys general announced they had begun similar investigations.The Department of Justice also asked the FBI in March to look into whether ExxonMobil had broken federal racketeering statutes by suppressing information about the links between fossil fuels and climate change. The move recalled past efforts to punish corporate duplicity: Federal prosecutors successfully used the very same statutes to prosecute tobacco companies for willfully misleading the public about the health effects of smoking.Plummeting oil prices have also helped force the company onto the ropes. ExxonMobil has had to dial back new oil exploration projects. And in February, Standard and Poor’s downgraded ExxonMobil's credit rating, a sign that investors might have doubts about the company's ability to continue generating fat returns.Now, the oil giant is facing a reckoning from shareholders. Since January, a group of investors has been calling on the company to provide annual assessments detailing precisely how its business would be affected by global temperature increases and policies designed to slow the planet's warming.The company published a report in 2014 outlining its strategies for dealing with a warming planet and climate policy. But shareholders remain concerned that international efforts to slow climate change by curbing fossil fuel use could hurt ExxonMobil's business model. They say the company has not told investors how its business would perform if global temperature increases were limited to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the warming cap set by the global climate accord adopted by 195 countries in December.Calls for greater transparency at the oil giant reflect a broader trend of investors demanding that companies be more upfront about the risks posed by climate change and climate policy, according to Lance Pierce, president of CDP North America, a nonprofit that tracks corporate disclosures around climate change.""As more and more investors have themselves begun to internalize the projected risks of climate change to their portfolios, they've begun in increasing numbers to make asks of this industry and others about what the impacts are,"" Pierce told HuffPost. ""What we're seeing now is not new, and it's probably not the high water mark either,"" Pierce added. Even if the proposals are not adopted Wednesday, they still could help convince the company's executives that shareholders feel strongly about the issue, according to Mulvey.ExxonMobil has already tempered its public position on climate change. The company's CEO, Rex Tillerson, said as recently as 2012 that fears about climate change were overblown, stoked by environmental groups who “manufacture fear.” Now, the company says it's confronting climate change head on. “We see the issue of climate change, we see the risks of climate change and take them seriously, and we are working hard on lower emissions technology,” Alan T. Jeffers, a company spokesman, told The New York Times last week. For instance, the company has partnered with clean technology firm FuelCell to develop improved carbon capture and storage technologies. Other energy companies are beginning to shift their official position on climate change as well, according to Mulvey. ""The other fossil fuel companies are definitely paying attention,"" Mulvey said. ""The pressure that's rising on ExxonMobil should create a powerful incentive for other companies to distinguish themselves.""Whether public statements about transparency and climate change will translate into action remains difficult to say, according to Kert Davies, executive director of the Climate Investigations Center, a group that monitors environmental policy. ""They're not going to win,"" Davies told HuffPost, referring to shareholders putting climate change resolutions before ExxonMobil. ""But shareholder activists are long haul activists. They’re very patient.""Even so, some environmentalist activists see shareholder resolutions, no matter how progressive, as insufficient. The logic is simple: Fossil fuel companies are unlikely to change their basic business model, and it’s too late to try to work with them to clean up their act. These activists advocate divesting from fossil fuel companies altogether. “There’s just no more time for fooling around,"" Bill McKibben, founder of environmental advocacy group 350.org, told reporters on a call Monday.

19,BLACK VOICES,Meet The Black Woman Who Is Making Political History In Kentucky,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/attica-scott-black-woman-made-political-history-in-kentucky_us_5745d485e4b03ede44137c91,Attica Scott's historical win is significant for so many reasons.,2016-05-25,Attica Scott is poised to make both political and black history in Kentucky. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745ea351200002e008947e4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's one word Attica Scott said she would use to describe her recent win at the Kentucky Democratic Primary, ""sweet."" It's an accurate description for her May 17, victory that will send Scott, who has no Republican challenger, straight to the Kentucky House in January. And an even sweeter victory considering it has been nearly 20 years since a black woman served in the state's legislature. ""That is huge,"" Scott told HuffPost on the significance of her win. ""It’s historical but it also sends a message that people realize that we’re trying to move Kentucky forward and the only way we’re going to do that is if we do it together."" In claiming victory, she defeated Tom Riner, a 34 year conservative Democrat who only attracted 31 percent of the votes in the state's 41st district this year. But Scott, a relative underdog in the race, won with 54 percent of the votes. ""It’s such a sense of humility to think that such a diverse district decided to put their votes in me over someone who had name recognition, history and three decades of service,"" Scott said. ""I appreciate them, the voters in the district."" Scott is a mom, long-time organizer and community leader who said she decided to run for office because it allowed her an opportunity to marry her experience in activism with her degrees in Political Science and Communications.Scott has previously served on the state's metro council for nearly four years and is the former executive director of KY Jobs With Justice, a social services organization where she worked heavily with issues related to labor unions, immigrant worker justice, single parent healthcare and more. ""I believe that as black people and as women we have got to serve in office,"" she said. ""Kentucky ranks 42 of 50 states in its number of women in its state legislature, that is unacceptable. I answered the call to serve and I’m gonna work to encourage other women, especially young women, to answer that call as well."" In answering that call, Scott said she plans to pursue agendas she believes deserve more critical attention like juvenile justice reform. Scott, who also said she admires the Black Lives Matter movement for what it has done to explore and elevate the conversation around police violence, was one of the most vocal people to speak out about the death of Gynna McMillen. Sixteen-year-old McMillen died in a juvenile detention center in January after guards used a marshall arts move to restraint her.""One of the reasons why we're saying her name, Gynna McMillen, is because we need some serious reforms within our juvenile detention centers,"" Scott said. ""Quite frankly, I believe we need restorative justice policies and practices. We need to stop criminalizing our kids, the young people who are trying to learn from their mistakes, we need to have policies that address their educational attainment, opportunities in their communities for them to make a living, rather than criminalizing them for mistakes that they’re making as young people who are frustrated with the society we’ve created."" Scott has big plans for Kentucky. She said she's coming in with a ""pro-labor, pro-worker, pro-woman, pro-black, pro-immigrant, pro-woman of color, pro-young people agenda,"" which will undoubtedly shake things up after more than three decades in a district led by Riner, who she described as ""anti-choice and anti-fairness."" ""We totally flipped on its head,"" Scott said. ""I am the person serving in the seat but this is about us... and serving people who often feel marginalized, powerless, voiceless and who are oppressed. This is about the we."""
20,POLITICS,"Clinton Email Server Broke Government Rules, Watchdog Finds",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-email-server_us_57460a9de4b055bb117113ff,State Department inspector general highly critical of Clinton's use of a server in her home.,2016-05-25,"Hillary Clinton, former U.S. secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, smiles while testifying during a House Select Committee on Benghazi hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57460b811200002e00894826.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton broke government rules by using a private email server without approval for her work as U.S. secretary of state, an internal government watchdog said on Wednesday.The long-awaited report by the State Department inspector general was the first official audit of the controversial arrangement to be made public. It was highly critical of Clinton's use of a server in her home, and immediately fueled Republican attacks on Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in an already acrimonious presidential race.The report, which also found problems in department record-keeping practices before Clinton's tenure, undermined Clinton's earlier defenses of her emails, likely adding to Democratic anxieties about public perceptions of the candidate. A majority of voters say Clinton is dishonest, according to multiple polls.The report concluded that Clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security. The report said that staff who later raised concerns were told to keep quiet. Several suspected hacking attempts in 2011 were never reported to department information security officials, in breach of department rules, it said.""She's as crooked as they come,"" Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, said of Clinton at a campaign rally in Anaheim, California, adding that the report's findings were ""not good"" for her. Clinton's campaign disagreed, saying the report rebutted Republican's criticism.The inspector general's office examined email record-keeping under five secretaries state, both Democratic and Republican. John Kerry, the current officeholder, and predecessors Madeline Albright, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice all agreed to speak to the inspector general's investigators. Clinton was the only one who declined to be interviewed, as did her aides.The report contradicted Clinton's repeated assertion that her server was allowed and that no permission was needed.Several other inquiries continue, including a U.S. Justice Department investigation into whether the arrangement broke laws.The inspector general's report cited ""longstanding, systemic weaknesses"" with State Department records that predated Clinton's tenure, and found problems with the email record-keeping of some of her predecessors, particularly Powell, that failed to comply with the Federal Records Act.But it singled out Clinton for her decision to use a private server in her home in Chappaqua, New York, for government business.""OIG found no evidence that the Secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server,"" the report said, using an abbreviation for the office of inspector general.The report said Clinton should have discussed the arrangement with the department's security and technology officials. Officials told investigators that they ""did not - and would not - approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business."" The reason, those officials said, is because it breached department rules and presented ""security risks.""CONCERNS SILENCEDState Department spokesman Mark Toner said he would not ""challenge"" those findings. He told reporters the department was aware of hacking attempts on Clinton's server, but had no evidence that any were successful.When two lower-level information technology officials tried to raise concerns about Clinton's email arrangement in late 2010, their supervisor in Clinton's office instructed them ""never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again,"" the report said. Their supervisor told them that department lawyers had approved of the system, but the inspector general's office said it found no evidence this was true.Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said the report rebutted criticisms of Clinton made by her political opponents.""The report shows that problems with the State Department's electronic recordkeeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a State Department email account until after the arrival of her successor,"" he said in a statement.He did not address the report's criticism of Clinton's use of a private server, something no other secretary of state has done.Democrats, including fundraisers for Clinton's campaign, said the report revealed nothing new.""It's digging and digging and digging,"" Amy Rao, the chief executive of data company Integrated Archive Systems and a Clinton fundraiser, said in an interview, comparing the investigation to probes the Clintons faced in the 1990s. ""Trust me: There's no there there. It's Whitewater.""Current Secretary of State Kerry asked Steve Linick, the State Department inspector general, to investigate after Clinton's email arrangement came to light last year. President Barack Obama appointed Linick to the role in 2013.Republicans have used Clinton's email practice to suggest she was trying to hide government records from scrutiny under public-access laws.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the findings ""are just the latest chapter in the long saga of Hillary Clinton's bad judgment that broke federal rules and endangered our national security.""(Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Patricia Zengerle and Arshad Mohammed in Washington and Michelle Conlin in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler)"
