In it, a man in a blue gingham shirt appears to be kicking a black man lying on the ground.""At least a half-dozen attendees shoved and tackled the protester, a black man, to the ground as he refused to leave the event,"" Diamond reported for CNN. ""At least one man punched the protester and a woman kicked him while he was on the ground.""Police officers then escorted the protester out.

Birmingham police later confirmed to The Huffington Post via email that three protesters were asked to leave after the incident but said that no incident report was filed.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cort Gatliff, a copy chief at the marketing firm Embassy Creative, told The Huffington Post that he saw the scuffle unfold, but he was not close enough to see everything that occurred.

Today, we speak with Iranian journalist Maziar Bahari, who spent 118 days in Iranian prison in 2009.When world powers signed a deal to curb the country's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief in July, some supporters were hopeful that the agreement would bolster reformists in Iran.Yet as Iran begins to implement the deal, there are signs of a backlash from hard-liners in the regime. A wave of arrests of journalists, poets and cartoonists in Iran this month suggests a crackdown on dissenting voices. In addition, the government convicted Iranian-American Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian of espionage in a secret trial last month, and has since detained two other Americans -- U.S. citizen Siamak Namazi and U.S. resident Nizar Zakka.Adding to the tense atmosphere is the fact that the country is gearing up for elections in February, in which Iranians will vote for members of parliament and the Assembly of Experts, which appoints and supervises Iran's Supreme Leader.Iranian-Canadian journalist and documentary filmmaker Maziar Bahari has more perspective than most on what's happening in the country. In 2009, Bahari spent 118 days jailed without charge in Iran, and his memoir formed the basis for the 2014 film ""Rosewater"" by comedian Jon Stewart. After Bahari was freed, he was sentenced in absentia and banned from returning to Iran. He is now advocating for the freedom of other journalists in the country through the ""Not A Crime"" campaign, as well as for the rights of the Baha'i religious minority.The WorldPost spoke to Bahari about what's behind the crackdown and the prospects for change in Iran.What do you think is behind the latest wave of arrests in Iran?Some of the Revolutionary Guards and some people around [Supreme Leader] Ayatollah Khamenei were opposed to reaching a nuclear deal with the conditions that are currently in the deal. They always said: We're not going to make any compromise with the Great Satan. But they felt under pressure to sign the deal because of people's dissatisfaction with the Iranian economy. So they lost face, internationally and domestically.Now they're trying control the domestic scene through these crackdowns. This is both in order to compensate for the loss of face, and also because of the upcoming February elections. The election of [President Hassan] Rouhani in 2013 showed that the people want some sort of change, and they may not elect the current members of the parliament again. So these crackdowns are in order to control domestic politics and stop the reformists from getting into the parliament and the Assembly of Experts. There is another element. The Revolutionary Guards are not just a political and military body, but also an economic body. By arresting these people -- the journalists, as well as Iranian-American business consultant Siamak Namazi and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese IT expert with an American green card -- they want to tell potential investors in Iran, ""If you invest in Iran, you have to deal with us; if you only deal with Rouhani's government, we can always put your partners in prison, and we can also put Rouhani's officials in prison. So you have to come and see us first.""How has the nuclear deal affected the struggle between hard-liners and moderates in Iranian politics -- both in the short term and long term?I think the deal has two objectives: curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in the short term, and normalizing relations between Iran and the rest of the world. That will empower reformists and the people of Iran in the long term.In the short term, of course, there will be obstacles, which we have already seen. The Revolutionary Guards and the Supreme Leader and the people around him are trying to make the internal situation more claustrophobic. But through Iran's relationship with the rest of the world, the reformists will have the upper hand.Iranian society is progressing, whether the Revolutionary Guards want it or not. The young people of Iran look at the world with very different concepts -- human rights, gay rights, minority rights -- from when I was growing up in the 1980s. People have different ideas, and they are much more open-minded.But there is no panacea that can solve all of Iran's problems. People in Iran don't like any short-term solutions anyway. They prefer gradual, slow change, both because of what happened to other countries in the neighborhood, like Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and because we had a revolution against a dictatorial regime in 1979, but it resulted in a disaster. What is the biggest challenge Iranian journalists face?The government of Iran is the biggest challenge. This is partly due to a change happening around the world -- that information is becoming democratized, and as a result, different institutions, whether corporations, governments, powerful individuals, want to curb the power of journalists. In Iran, the situation is even worse. The government thrives in secrecy, and as a result journalists -- whose job, by definition, is informing people -- are more in danger than other groups in Iran. They are also more vulnerable because Iranian journalists don't have a union and their employers are very vulnerable to government pressure. When I went to prison, Don Graham, the owner of The Washington Post, which at that time also owned Newsweek, just signed a blank check, gave it to the Newsweek editors, and said, ""I want him out of prison."" Right now Jeff Bezos is doing the same with Jason Rezaian. They are doing it because they are strong publishers of independent media. In Iran we don't have that. The reason I started the Not A Crime campaign is because when you grow older, you realize that you don't have that much time and you don't have that much energy, and you have to really put your time and resources and energy into things that you see can have an impact. When I was in prison, and even before, I was thinking about what main issues I could dedicate my time to in order to have a real impact in Iran. If the Iranian government allows journalists to do their job and inform the public with relative freedom, it would show there is a maturity and a logic in the government.The other component of the campaign is raising awareness that the Baha'i religious minority are third-class citizens in Iran. And the reason a non-Baha'i like myself is dedicating time to this issue is that if the Iranian government gives freedom to the Baha'is, that would also show a certain level of reasonableness or pragmatism in the Iranian government. The Baha'i issue goes really to the core of Shia clergy's battle against modernism in Iran. The end goal is to fight against censorship and oppression through what they're censoring and what they're suppressing. For example, we are fighting discrimination in education through education and creativity. It's very easy to issue manifestos and vilify the Iranian government, but that's not effective. Yes, the government of Iran is doing something really evil, but you cannot fight evil with evil.Considering your own experiences, what do you think are the prospects of Jason Rezaian being released?We don't know anything about what is happening to Jason. Not many people, even in the Iranian government, know anything about what's happening to Jason. That's the real tragedy. I always tell families and relatives and colleagues of people who are arrested to campaign for their release, and as soon as possible. Based on my own experience and others who've been in prison more recently, they put the prisoner immediately under pressure, promising to release him or her as soon as they make a confession. But then instead of releasing them, they use the confession against that person later in court. By publicizing the plight of prisoners as soon as they're imprisoned, you're somehow lifting the pressure inside prison, so that confession is not extracted as quickly as they would like. Publicity puts pressure on the government of Iran as a whole, because you don't know who exactly to put pressure on. This pressure may trickle through to the interrogator.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.CORRECTION: This post has been updated to correct the surname of Don Graham.Also on HuffPost:"

Maybe not.,2015-11-21,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) proposed tough new measures to curb the admission of refugees from Syria and other ""high-risk"" countries into the United States.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564f9ef41700004b00e1a43a.jpeg?ops=crop_11_211_2989_1789%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-Ky.) tough proposals aimed at limiting the admission of refugees in the wake of the Paris terror attacks are disappointing libertarian opinion leaders, days after a presidential debate performance in which he appeared to return to his independent roots.Paul said on Saturday that the United States and Europe ""have to be very careful about bringing refugees to our country that might attack us.” He introduced a bill on Thursday that would, among other things, put a moratorium on resettlement of refugees from 34 “high-risk” countries. The list includes predominantly Muslim countries, Russia and North Korea.Paul also introduced an amendment to a housing and transportation funding bill this week that would bar federally-funded social welfare assistance for refugees from those “high-risk” nations. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) canceled a planned vote on the omnibus bill on Thursday after Paul insisted that his amendment receive a vote.Libertarians, who have looked to Paul as a rare kindred spirit in Congress and the Republican presidential field, are not generally fans of federal assistance to U.S. citizens, let alone refugees and other immigrants. But two leading libertarian policy experts told The Huffington Post they oppose reforms to the welfare state that would discriminate against people from certain countries.“It would be wrong to establish national origin-based criteria for deciding who gets access to what benefits,” said David Bier, director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center. “That is not really in accord with the libertarian ideal of equality under the law.”Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, co-authored a 2013 paper calling for an end to all means-tested assistance programs, which would “build a wall around the welfare state, not the country.” Paul expressed similar sentiments during the debate over the comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013.But Nowrasteh said he objects to Paul’s new amendment selectively restricting benefits, noting that the legislation fuels an inaccurate narrative that refugees are seeking entry to the U.S. primarily to take advantage of government benefits.“The reason Syrians and other refugees from the Middle East are coming here is not because food stamps ran out in their home countries, it is primarily because they are fleeing violence,” Nowrasteh said. “We have a huge problem with the welfare state in this country, but refugee and immigrant abuse of it is is a very minor, microscopic part of the problem. To focus on that detracts from the real problem we face.”Bier said that Paul’s amendment restricting welfare payments is especially troubling in light of his proposed restrictions on refugee intake from those same countries.“What we’ve suggested is that individuals in the U.S. should be able to privately sponsor refugees, agreeing to cover the costs of bringing them over and providing those benefits to individuals” once they arrive, Bier said. “Our problem with the Paul’s proposal is that he is not offering an alternative to the federal government sponsored initiative.”Bier noted that private refugee sponsorship and funding has been permitted in the past. He wrote earlier this month that it was a policy favored by former President Ronald Reagan.Nowrasteh said he would be open to a more restrictive admission process if the current system was failing to address the threat posed by hypothetical refugee infiltration, but he doesn't believe that's the case.“There is definitely a threat, but it is very minor, especially through the refugee system,” Nowrasteh said. “This type of drastic measure is an overreaction to the tragic terrorist attacks.”Liz Mair, president of the communications firm Mair Strategies and a former online communications strategist for Paul, noted that Paul is not an orthodox libertarian.""With regard to the limiting of [refugee] admissions, this might be an area where Rand is leaning more towards 'conservative' than 'libertarian,'"" Mair, a self-described libertarian Republican, said. ""But then again, he is a libertarian conservative, or a conservative libertarian. He's not a purist."" Paul's Senate office provided details about the legislation, but wouldn't respond to the criticism. ""What's happening requires a careful balance of libertarian principles: between the job of the government to ensure the protection of American citizens and the purpose of the United States to be an exceptional nation of freedom in a world filled with tyranny,"" a spokesperson for Paul's campaign told HuffPost in a statement. ""Paul's plan is the best way to balance those principles. Unlike many of his Republican counterparts, the senator has not called for an end to Syrian immigration, but instead -- as smart leaders do -- he has called for a suspension of the program until we can ensure that it does not pose a threat the American citizens."" Paul is not the only Republican presidential candidate to embrace tighter refugee admission standards after the Nov. 13 Paris attacks. Most of them have proposed curbing re-settlement of Syrian refugees to the U.S. in one form or another.What makes Paul's hard-line stance unique is his typically more moderate approach to national security-related matters, and his attempt to appeal to libertarian-leaning Republican voters.Paul's proposals follow an acclaimed Nov. 10 Republican presidential debate performance in which he emphasized his libertarian-leaning positions, expressing opposition to increased U.S. military intervention in Syria and rapping rival Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for proposing an increase in defense spending.Bier said he's not surprised by Paul’s pivot, but the contrast between the candidate's debate performance and his legislative proposals this week heightens the disappointment.“As a libertarian, I felt like he was definitely speaking to more of [our] concerns than we had seen in prior debates,” Bier said.Paul has struggled to gain support in the crowded Republican presidential primary field. He currently has the support of 2.8 percent of likely GOP primary voters, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average.Mair said she rejects the notion that Paul is pandering to conservative elements of the Republican base to gain ground in the presidential primary. She said Paul should be taken at face value when he says he was influenced by the 2011 capture of two Iraqi refugees in his hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, trying to buy weapons for al Qaeda in Iraq. (Anne Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, testified at a House hearing on Thursday that screening improvements since then would have prevented the men from being admitted to the U.S.)""People, even political leaders who we sort of expect to view everything objectively and dispassionately, are often colored by events in their local communities,"" Mair said.Bier, however, characterized Paul’s hard-line stance on refugees as a misguided political gambit.“Every time he has made a jerk to the right to appeal to more conservative issues, he loses what distinguishes him from the rest of the field,” Bier said. “He has made such an incredible effort to appeal to minorities and expand the appeal of the Republican Party that it just seems at odds with his general pitch to put forward legislation that would create this type of two-tiered system for certain nationalities.”Also on HuffPost:"

The list includes predominantly Muslim countries, Russia and North Korea.Paul also introduced an amendment to a housing and transportation funding bill this week that would bar federally-funded social welfare assistance for refugees from those “high-risk” nations. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) canceled a planned vote on the omnibus bill on Thursday after Paul insisted that his amendment receive a vote.Libertarians, who have looked to Paul as a rare kindred spirit in Congress and the Republican presidential field, are not generally fans of federal assistance to U.S. citizens, let alone refugees and other immigrants. But two leading libertarian policy experts told The Huffington Post they oppose reforms to the welfare state that would discriminate against people from certain countries.“It would be wrong to establish national origin-based criteria for deciding who gets access to what benefits,” said David Bier, director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center. “That is not really in accord with the libertarian ideal of equality under the law.”Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, co-authored a 2013 paper calling for an end to all means-tested assistance programs, which would “build a wall around the welfare state, not the country.” Paul expressed similar sentiments during the debate over the comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013.But Nowrasteh said he objects to Paul’s new amendment selectively restricting benefits, noting that the legislation fuels an inaccurate narrative that refugees are seeking entry to the U.S. primarily to take advantage of government benefits.“The reason Syrians and other refugees from the Middle East are coming here is not because food stamps ran out in their home countries, it is primarily because they are fleeing violence,” Nowrasteh said. “We have a huge problem with the welfare state in this country, but refugee and immigrant abuse of it is is a very minor, microscopic part of the problem. To focus on that detracts from the real problem we face.”Bier said that Paul’s amendment restricting welfare payments is especially troubling in light of his proposed restrictions on refugee intake from those same countries.“What we’ve suggested is that individuals in the U.S. should be able to privately sponsor refugees, agreeing to cover the costs of bringing them over and providing those benefits to individuals” once they arrive, Bier said. “Our problem with the Paul’s proposal is that he is not offering an alternative to the federal government sponsored initiative.”Bier noted that private refugee sponsorship and funding has been permitted in the past. He wrote earlier this month that it was a policy favored by former President Ronald Reagan.Nowrasteh said he would be open to a more restrictive admission process if the current system was failing to address the threat posed by hypothetical refugee infiltration, but he doesn't believe that's the case.“There is definitely a threat, but it is very minor, especially through the refugee system,” Nowrasteh said. “This type of drastic measure is an overreaction to the tragic terrorist attacks.”Liz Mair, president of the communications firm Mair Strategies and a former online communications strategist for Paul, noted that Paul is not an orthodox libertarian.""With regard to the limiting of [refugee] admissions, this might be an area where Rand is leaning more towards 'conservative' than 'libertarian,'"" Mair, a self-described libertarian Republican, said. ""But then again, he is a libertarian conservative, or a conservative libertarian. He's not a purist."" Paul's Senate office provided details about the legislation, but wouldn't respond to the criticism. ""What's happening requires a careful balance of libertarian principles: between the job of the government to ensure the protection of American citizens and the purpose of the United States to be an exceptional nation of freedom in a world filled with tyranny,"" a spokesperson for Paul's campaign told HuffPost in a statement. ""Paul's plan is the best way to balance those principles. Unlike many of his Republican counterparts, the senator has not called for an end to Syrian immigration, but instead -- as smart leaders do -- he has called for a suspension of the program until we can ensure that it does not pose a threat the American citizens."" Paul is not the only Republican presidential candidate to embrace tighter refugee admission standards after the Nov. 13 Paris attacks. Most of them have proposed curbing re-settlement of Syrian refugees to the U.S. in one form or another.What makes Paul's hard-line stance unique is his typically more moderate approach to national security-related matters, and his attempt to appeal to libertarian-leaning Republican voters.Paul's proposals follow an acclaimed Nov. 10 Republican presidential debate performance in which he emphasized his libertarian-leaning positions, expressing opposition to increased U.S. military intervention in Syria and rapping rival Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for proposing an increase in defense spending.Bier said he's not surprised by Paul’s pivot, but the contrast between the candidate's debate performance and his legislative proposals this week heightens the disappointment.“As a libertarian, I felt like he was definitely speaking to more of [our] concerns than we had seen in prior debates,” Bier said.Paul has struggled to gain support in the crowded Republican presidential primary field. He currently has the support of 2.8 percent of likely GOP primary voters, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average.Mair said she rejects the notion that Paul is pandering to conservative elements of the Republican base to gain ground in the presidential primary. She said Paul should be taken at face value when he says he was influenced by the 2011 capture of two Iraqi refugees in his hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, trying to buy weapons for al Qaeda in Iraq. (Anne Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, testified at a House hearing on Thursday that screening improvements since then would have prevented the men from being admitted to the U.S.)""People, even political leaders who we sort of expect to view everything objectively and dispassionately, are often colored by events in their local communities,"" Mair said.Bier, however, characterized Paul’s hard-line stance on refugees as a misguided political gambit.“Every time he has made a jerk to the right to appeal to more conservative issues, he loses what distinguishes him from the rest of the field,” Bier said. “He has made such an incredible effort to appeal to minorities and expand the appeal of the Republican Party that it just seems at odds with his general pitch to put forward legislation that would create this type of two-tiered system for certain nationalities.”Also on HuffPost:"

While European nations have rushed to strengthen border checks and intelligence cooperation since the Paris attacks, far-right politicians have seized the moment to call for the borders to be closed to refugees and other migrants. This week, Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia stopped admitting anyone not coming from the most war-torn countries, such as Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq, which has created a bottleneck on Greece's northern border.

Would it have remained inert? Of course not.So, why doesn't it do something about the refugees? Because, in the final analysis, [the state] isn't sure it wants to do something, and what's more, it has also convinced itself that it cannot either.Why wouldn't the state want to find a solution?I think this goes deeper than problems caused by the financial crisis. Large parts of the Greek government -- both the central and local governments -- believe that because these people came here just in order to leave, our sole obligation toward them is only this: to prevent them from drowning upon their arrival and to facilitate their departure. If we set up hospitality structures, some are afraid that they will become a ""pull factor,"" or encourage people to stay. This belief is shared by both the right wing and the left wing.What could the Greek state actually do? The situation is beyond control. I do not mean to deny or downplay this fact. On the contrary, the situation has all the characteristics of an emergency. The state should, first of all, realize and recognize this. A state of emergency should be declared in some islands, especially Lesbos. Things cannot go along with the ordinary procedures and schedules. The army should also help deal with the refugee crisis -- not only to impose order, but to do what a dismantled state cannot. Why doesn't the army show up? Simply because both the political and the military leadership know that if they get involved with the refugee issue, they will have to continue to deal with it for years to come. But what can we do? This is how the army works in established democracies during times of peace.Wouldn't that project a negative image?In times of peace, the army is not there to wage war. There are many positive things about bringing in the army during a state of emergency.Firstly, the state could prove that, even with all the difficulties it faces, it can assume responsibility. Secondly, winter is coming, and we would solve the immediate problem of ensuring these people's survival. Thirdly, we would take the burden off the shoulders of all the volunteers. We have replaced the state with volunteers, and I honestly wonder how much longer they can last. Last but not least, as the refugee crisis escalates, we will at least have somewhere to accommodate people.Greece should also open the border along the Evros river with Turkey. The border fence can stay, but we should open border stations for people to cross. This would reduce the dangers that people face when sailing across the Aegean Sea, because the land crossing is easier and safer than the sea passage. There should be a possibility of safe passage into Greece. It would also put pressure on Turkey to do its job, namely, to check who is in need of protection.Let's be honest: By the term ""refugee crisis,"" we mean the islands of the East Aegean and some of the other islands. The rest of Greece hasn't realized yet what this means. Why should Lesbos face the problem all on its own?Do you think Europe's moves to tighten border controls after the Paris attacks will make the problem worse?The problem will increase with the closing of the borders, but not only because of that. It will also get worse because of the war in Syria. With the military intervention, air raids and the possibility of a ground invasion in the future, people cannot stay there. A combination of extremely negative circumstances suggests the refugee crisis will only escalate. Who benefits from this rhetoric equating refugees with terrorists?It benefits the logic that, in the name of the war against terrorism, we should shut the borders to refugees and seal off Europe in general. Will this solve the problem? In the mid-term, perhaps it will for some countries with land borders. But it will increase the difficulties for Greece. In the long term, however, it will only make the problem worse and make it more challenging to deal with. Do you predict a Europe of closed borders?I see more restrictive policies possibly prevailing over the openness that Germany attempted this summer. It would be a bad development for Greece if we turn from a transit country into a holding country, bringing all the discussion about detention centers to the fore again. For Europe in general, if such policies prevail, it will be a vindication of the extreme-right agenda and everything that entails. In less than a hundred years, there could be another war within Europe if the extreme right becomes the legitimate political expression of a large part of the European population.

There are many positive things about bringing in the army during a state of emergency.Firstly, the state could prove that, even with all the difficulties it faces, it can assume responsibility. Secondly, winter is coming, and we would solve the immediate problem of ensuring these people's survival. Thirdly, we would take the burden off the shoulders of all the volunteers. We have replaced the state with volunteers, and I honestly wonder how much longer they can last. Last but not least, as the refugee crisis escalates, we will at least have somewhere to accommodate people.Greece should also open the border along the Evros river with Turkey. The border fence can stay, but we should open border stations for people to cross. This would reduce the dangers that people face when sailing across the Aegean Sea, because the land crossing is easier and safer than the sea passage. There should be a possibility of safe passage into Greece. It would also put pressure on Turkey to do its job, namely, to check who is in need of protection.Let's be honest: By the term ""refugee crisis,"" we mean the islands of the East Aegean and some of the other islands. The rest of Greece hasn't realized yet what this means. Why should Lesbos face the problem all on its own?Do you think Europe's moves to tighten border controls after the Paris attacks will make the problem worse?The problem will increase with the closing of the borders, but not only because of that. It will also get worse because of the war in Syria. With the military intervention, air raids and the possibility of a ground invasion in the future, people cannot stay there. A combination of extremely negative circumstances suggests the refugee crisis will only escalate. Who benefits from this rhetoric equating refugees with terrorists?It benefits the logic that, in the name of the war against terrorism, we should shut the borders to refugees and seal off Europe in general. Will this solve the problem? In the mid-term, perhaps it will for some countries with land borders. But it will increase the difficulties for Greece. In the long term, however, it will only make the problem worse and make it more challenging to deal with. Do you predict a Europe of closed borders?I see more restrictive policies possibly prevailing over the openness that Germany attempted this summer. It would be a bad development for Greece if we turn from a transit country into a holding country, bringing all the discussion about detention centers to the fore again. For Europe in general, if such policies prevail, it will be a vindication of the extreme-right agenda and everything that entails. In less than a hundred years, there could be another war within Europe if the extreme right becomes the legitimate political expression of a large part of the European population. Europe cannot take that. Europe must realize that if it goes down that road, it will undermine its own existence as a political structure.Therefore, in the long term, by helping refugees we are basically helping ourselves. I think this is something that we should all realize. This story originally appeared on HuffPost Greece. It was translated into English and edited for a global audience. Also on HuffPost:"

""We're American citizens just like everybody else.""The airline said in a statement to Gawker on Saturday that the incident only lasted a few minutes.""We had a slight delay boarding, lasting only a few minutes, while we completed a brief passenger conversation.

We are responsible for the comfort of all passengers and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind.""It wasn't the only reported incident of discrimination on the airline this week. Six men were removed from a flight from Chicago to Houston after reportedly asking other passengers to switch seats so they could all sit together, ABC Chicago reported.

She's sure you don't understand her, don't really care, think only how you want her to look for your friends, think she's not a good enough of a person, and deep down disapprove of her in general, nevertheless, as a growing young woman. Hopefully, not all of that--but probably some of that. What's a caring mother to do? Why Teenage Daughters Really Love Their MothersOn the other hand, to your surprise, if she could spell it out, she loves you deeply, wants desperately to be liked and loved by you, wants your approval above everyone else's, and needs you to know her as she really is as of right now in her tumultuous life. Rules and restrictions that are intended to keep her safe only make her feel alienated and judged like she doesn't have a decent mind of her own, can't make sensible judgments, and is a basic loser (the way she feels about herself).Punishments make her avoid you, escalate not listening to you because you just become a misinterpreting authority who doesn't get it.Why? Because deep down she has at least one if not all of the following three big fears:• being seen as failure • being rejected • being abandoned and unloved. The Remedy--Unlock Your Parental Intelligence1. Step Back when you see a behavior that is puzzling, disarming, and distressing. That means pause, wait, don't react, even say nothing and just observe. See how often it occurs and keep track in your mind if you see a pattern. This outward calm may have a good effect because your daughter doesn't feel judged because you're not judging her. You're just paying attention quietly. How can you judge what you don't understand yet?2. Self-Reflect which means monitor your own feelings and reactions. Look inward to your own mind instead of just focusing on your daughter. Are you scared, worried, angry, confused? If you are there's a good chance, your daughter is too. Does she remind you of yourself when you were her age? Does she or do you remind you of your mother? Just think this through. Remember--no reacting yet.3. Understand Your Daughter's Mind by beginning to listen carefully without judgment to whatever she mentions. You might hear her criticize a friend, admit to a lowered grade, tell you about a secret boyfriend, come in past curfew. Hang out and listen, listen, listen without punishments or criticisms. Be a sounding board, not a know-it-all. You are becoming a ""Meaning-Maker."" Her behaviors are turning into words and they are starting to mean something. In fact, you've shifted your focus from her external actions to her internal world. Bravo! Now you're the mother she can trust and confide in.4. Understand Your Daughter's Development by realizing how much she's changed in a year or a month! Notice if she's moody or has settled down. Don't comment, just be sensitive.5. Problem Solve the real problems, not the external stuff like messy rooms and curfews and homework. By now, you've gotten to know the real girl who used to avoid you and feel all alone. She's your girl again. The one who used to talk to you when she was nine. She no longer feels judged so she can tell you the overarching problems like her low self-esteem, her fears of rejection, her need to be loved and maybe even held once in a while.  Each teenage girl is actually different. They all go through stages in their own specific and unique ways and need to know you know that. Being different is good. Who needs ordinary and acceptable?

She ordered a $30 steak and requested cooked to ""medium.""Kendal, 42, wasn't thrilled with the order when it arrived.""I had ordered a medium steak and when it came out I thought it was very well-done, overcooked and tough,"" she told SWNS. ""A few minutes later, I said to the waiter that I wasn't happy with the meal and the landlady came over and was rude and aggressive.""She was offered a fresh steak in exchange, but refused it because she did not want to be eating after her friends had finished.Since she didn't eat the steak, Kendal was surprised when the bill arrived and included a $15 charge for the meat she didn't eat.""We paid the rest of the bill, but I went over to her and said, 'I'm sorry, but I am not paying anything for my meal,'"" Kendal said.

Rick Snyder (R) was so concerned with gaps in the refugee-screening process earlier this week that he announced vulnerable Syrians would no longer be allowed to resettle in his state. But when he was asked on NPR Thursday what parts of the security system concern him, he couldn't name any. ""I wouldn't single out any specific problem I have with it,"" Snyder said in an interview, as reported by Raw Story. He said he decided to ask for a ""pause"" in resettlement of Syrian refugees after Islamic State terrorists attacked Paris and Beirut and took credit for downing a plane in Egypt.""When you have these events, doesn't it make sense you should pause and simply say, let's continue looking at these events?"" Snyder said on NPR. ""And I really wanted the federal government to come back and say, you know, 'We have now made a review of these at least three situations' and believe their current system is acceptable or not or that they're making some modifications."" ""I don't think that's an unreasonable thing,"" he continued. ""I view that as pretty old-fashioned common sense, you know, being careful and at the same time trying to be proactive."" Syrian refugees became a focal point of the debate after the Paris attacks, as more than half of the nation's governors followed Snyder in saying the refugees should be banned from the U.S., and from their states, based on concerns that security screening was insufficient. (Governors cannot actually bar refugees from their states or dictate immigration policy.)Prior to his announcement, Snyder had said he would welcome more refugees to Michigan, and at least 75 Syrians already resettled there in 2015. Snyder insisted on NPR that the move wasn't about politics; he just wanted an explanation from the Obama administration of how the process worked and whether they believed it was sufficient. He said he was ""hopefully going to get a response"" to a letter he sent asking for a review and explanation of the system. The administration did respond to the many governors who expressed concern about Syrian refugee resettlement -- including Snyder -- although not in a personal letter. The White House held a 90-minute call on Tuesday about the refugee process. Afterward, a Snyder spokeswoman told the Associated Press that he had asked for ""more robust data"" but appreciated the discussion. The administration has argued the refugee screening process is already extensive -- it typically takes 18 to 24 months and requires in-person interviews, background checks, health assessments and the involvement of the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of Defense and other security agencies.  But even some Democrats say the White House hasn't done a good enough job of communicating that to politicians or to voters, creating public pressure for them to do something. A majority of Americans oppose allowing more Syrian refugees to come to the U.S., according to polling after the Paris attacks. Snyder's logic, like that of some Democrats, seemed to be that it wasn't so much that he thought a specific part of the current system was bad -- just that if people were worried about it, regardless of whether those fears were warranted, it should be temporarily stalled. He said he did not think the same type of ""pause"" was needed for other ways of entering the U.S., such as through tourist visas or the visa waiver program, which allows nationals of 38 countries to come in without a visa at all. Most of the Paris attackers, including the alleged planner of the attacks, were either Belgian or French. Both of those countries are on the visa waiver program. ""I wouldn't necessarily do that, but again, this is a particular case of this refugee process that there's a high degree of concern, and I heard that from our citizens,"" he said."

He said he decided to ask for a ""pause"" in resettlement of Syrian refugees after Islamic State terrorists attacked Paris and Beirut and took credit for downing a plane in Egypt.""When you have these events, doesn't it make sense you should pause and simply say, let's continue looking at these events?"" Snyder said on NPR. ""And I really wanted the federal government to come back and say, you know, 'We have now made a review of these at least three situations' and believe their current system is acceptable or not or that they're making some modifications."" ""I don't think that's an unreasonable thing,"" he continued. ""I view that as pretty old-fashioned common sense, you know, being careful and at the same time trying to be proactive."" Syrian refugees became a focal point of the debate after the Paris attacks, as more than half of the nation's governors followed Snyder in saying the refugees should be banned from the U.S., and from their states, based on concerns that security screening was insufficient. (Governors cannot actually bar refugees from their states or dictate immigration policy.)Prior to his announcement, Snyder had said he would welcome more refugees to Michigan, and at least 75 Syrians already resettled there in 2015. Snyder insisted on NPR that the move wasn't about politics; he just wanted an explanation from the Obama administration of how the process worked and whether they believed it was sufficient. He said he was ""hopefully going to get a response"" to a letter he sent asking for a review and explanation of the system. The administration did respond to the many governors who expressed concern about Syrian refugee resettlement -- including Snyder -- although not in a personal letter. The White House held a 90-minute call on Tuesday about the refugee process. Afterward, a Snyder spokeswoman told the Associated Press that he had asked for ""more robust data"" but appreciated the discussion. The administration has argued the refugee screening process is already extensive -- it typically takes 18 to 24 months and requires in-person interviews, background checks, health assessments and the involvement of the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of Defense and other security agencies.  But even some Democrats say the White House hasn't done a good enough job of communicating that to politicians or to voters, creating public pressure for them to do something. A majority of Americans oppose allowing more Syrian refugees to come to the U.S., according to polling after the Paris attacks. Snyder's logic, like that of some Democrats, seemed to be that it wasn't so much that he thought a specific part of the current system was bad -- just that if people were worried about it, regardless of whether those fears were warranted, it should be temporarily stalled. He said he did not think the same type of ""pause"" was needed for other ways of entering the U.S., such as through tourist visas or the visa waiver program, which allows nationals of 38 countries to come in without a visa at all. Most of the Paris attackers, including the alleged planner of the attacks, were either Belgian or French. Both of those countries are on the visa waiver program. ""I wouldn't necessarily do that, but again, this is a particular case of this refugee process that there's a high degree of concern, and I heard that from our citizens,"" he said."

But this year, the terrorist attacks that gripped Paris last Friday gave the campaign a sense of urgency.More than 350 interfaith events have taken place in England, Northern Ireland and Wales through Saturday, November 21. The dates were planned far in advance, but the week couldn't have come at a better time for members of the East London Mosque.Salman Farsi, a spokesman for the East End mosque, said that for years his house of worship has been a target for far right groups.“Often global events related to terrorism causes a spike in hate mail and physical attacks on members of our community,” Farsi told The Huffington Post. The mosque threw open its doors on Wednesday for a full-day Islam Awareness Course that had been in the works for some time. About 16 non-Muslims attended, including government workers, college diversity staff, local social workers and teachers. They were taught about Islam's intellectual history, the history of Muslims in Britain and the incredible diversity of beliefs and denominations within the religion.According to course organizer Juber Hussain, many also had questions about Sharia law, and Islam's stance on divorce, inheritance and polygamy. Hussain said the participants came away from the program with an idea of how complex and varied Islam is throughout the world. Across Great Britain, these moments of interfaith encounter were mirrored in churches, synagogues, mosques, universities and many other venues. There were interfaith pilgrimages, photography competitions, afternoon teas, panel discussions, and community music and arts festivals. Primary schools arranged visits to local houses of worship and universities held interfaith community service projects. This concerted and national effort was possible because the Inter Faith Network, the organization that produces Inter Faith Week, has the support of the nation's top faith bodies. The Network acts as an umbrella group for 66 member bodies, including academic, local, national and community organizations.Events like Inter Faith Week are a vital part of keeping Britain's increasingly multiracial society together, Vivian Wineman, the network's co-chair, said. ""Interfaith is valuable not just for bringing faiths together, but also for community cohesion,"" Wineman told the Huffington Post. ""It's about having the infrastructure in place where the faiths are already in dialogue with each other. Because when you've got a crisis like Paris, you don't have time at that stage to build those links."" The challenge, however, is the self-selection bias that can often come with these kinds of efforts. Wineman admitted that it's tough to reach parts of the community that aren't inclined to show up to one of the Week's events -- those who harbor racist, anti-Muslim or anti-Semitic beliefs, for example, or those who fear that interfaith dialogue would in some way weaken their own faith. These are, arguably, the people who may need to hear the message of interfaith unity the most. His advice is to reach out to religious leaders who are favorably inclined to interfaith dialogue, in the hopes that the message will percolate back to their communities. When people see their religious leaders in dialogue with people of other faiths, it tends to improve the atmosphere, he said.""It's not easy. If you go up to someone who is Islamophobic, you're not going to turn him around in his shoes after a conversation,"" Wineman said. ""But you can change the environment that he's operating in.""These challenges were on the minds of the leaders of Three Faiths Forum (3FF), one of the national interfaith groups that are members of the Inter Faith Network. For Inter Faith Week, 3FF produced an Interfaith Summit in London, a first for the 18-year-old organization. It was important to the young organizers of the event, many of whom were graduates of 3FF's ParliaMentors leadership program, to include workshops that encouraged people to ask genuine questions about other traditions -- and perhaps learn more about their own faith.""People need to get out of their comfort zones,"" 25-year-old Aaron D'Souza told Huff Post. ""Not just religion to religion, but within religions.""D'Souza, who identifies as Roman Catholic, said that the interfaith encounters he's had through 3FF have forced him to think about Catholicism more deeply. When people asked him questions about Christianity that he didn't have answers to, he'd have to go home and read up on the subject. And because he's learned about other people's religions, he said he's also been more prone to speaking up when he hears someone else talk negatively about another faith tradition.Anna Connell-Smith, a 26-year-old co-organizer for the event, said that it was important for her that the summit had an open, ""festival"" atmosphere, where young people in particular would feel welcome. ""It's important that this is coming from young people, and that others see that our generation is embracing the idea of interfaith,"" Connell-Smith told HuffPost.The interfaith community at the London School of Economics chose to organize their Inter Faith Week event around helping Syrian refugees. A Giving Tree set up on the university's campus invited passers-by to join in efforts to create welcome kits to donate to newly arrived refugees. Students agreed to buy small items-- like socks, underwear, and t-shirts -- and bring the goods back to LSE's Faith Centre to be assembled into kits.Tim Rogers, president of the school's Christian Union, took a pledge leaf this week and brought back a pack of deodorant. He told HuffPost that he was confident that most people of faith who are worried about the refugee crisis will only have compassion when they look across the English Channel to Calais, where many migrants are gathered and yearning for a chance at new life in the UK. ""Some people say religion is the problem,"" Rogers said. ""But religion can be part of the solution, too."" Also On HuffPost:"

25,BUSINESS,"No, Donald Trump, The Free Market Can't Solve The Child Care Crisis",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-day-care_us_564f4b12e4b0879a5b0ab4fb,Parents need a real solution to the lack of affordable day care for kids.,2015-11-20,GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump says companies should offer on-site day care.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564f66d01b0000270029e481.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Good child care is hard to find and even more difficult to afford in the U.S. And when asked, at a town hall meeting in Iowa Thursday, how he’d solve the problem as president, Donald Trump offered up a seductive, but grossly inadequate solution: More companies should offer on-site day care to their employees.“You know it’s not expensive for a company to do it, you need one person or two people and you need some blocks, you need some swings, you need some toys,” he said. The GOP presidential frontrunner explained that he offers on-site care at two of his offices.“They call them Trump Kids … Another one calls it Trumpateers. It’s cute ... It’s something that can be done I think very easily by a company,” Trump said.Putting aside the obvious (one hopes) fact that quality day care is more complicated than a couple of babysitters and some blocks and swings, company-provided care is something that simply doesn’t make sense for many employers for a host of reasons -- including cost, employee demographics and logistics. Indeed, only 2 percent of businesses in the U.S. currently provide on-site day care, according to a 2014 survey from the Families and Work Institute.So, no. It’s not the answer to what’s become a hugely urgent issue for many American families. A smattering of employers offering on-site day care doesn't solve what's become a systemic and pressing issue. Just like the recent spate of companies improving the quality of their parental leave policies doesn't make up for the fact that the U.S. is the only developed country where parents aren't guaranteed paid leave.Despite what Trump suggests, child care is one of those societal issues you simply can't leave up to businesses to solve.“It would be great if more employers offered more child care, but we know not everyone is going to,” Vivien Labaton, co-executive director of Make It Work, a nonprofit campaign focused on economic security for women and families, told The Huffington Post. “Your ability to access care shouldn’t hinge on whether you won the office lottery and happen to work at a place that provides child care.”Labaton’s group is advocating for a national policy solution to the problem. And it’s a doozy of a problem. It's more expensive to pay for a year of day care for an infant than to pay for a year of tuition at public colleges in most U.S. states, according to an analysis of child care costs by the progressive Economic Policy Institute, Daniel Marans wrote about earlier this year.Many parents are forced to send their children to day care providers that are scarily unsafe because it's all they can afford.For some businesses, offering child care to workers is a classic win-win: they earn workers' loyalty, and can even save money because employees are less likely to miss work. One California bank saved around $200,000 in annual costs using an on-site center, according to an analysis cited by Businessweek in 2007. A few well-known companies offer on-site care, including Google (at its headquarters in Mountain View, California) and tech company SAS.A Toyota plant in Kentucky has a great day care center, Ken Matos, senior director of research at the nonprofit Families and Work Institute, told HuffPost. Workers, who are relatively low paid, can drop their kids and then work a full night shift, he said. That widens the pool of available labor to the automaker.“It’s an example of how child care can be useful,"" he said. ""But they’re a large company with a lot of land. Imagine a company in New York City trying something similar.”For smaller companies the costs may be out of reach. State regulations around day care can be onerous, Baldwin said. Even if they’re not, the price of providing quality, enriching care can be high. It can cost around $2 million simply to build an on-site day care that can handle 100 kids, according to data cited by Fortune magazine.Also, companies don't usually offer free care to workers -- they offer subsidized care, Baldwin said. And for many low-paid workers even that is too expensive. “Corporate-sponsored child care is a great idea, but the notion that an on-site center is going to work for every company is a little bit missing the mark,” Debra Baldwin, director of corporate partnerships at the Boston College Center for Work and Family, told HuffPost.Even if you can do it, businesses don’t always have the right employee demographics. You need a critical mass of parents working for you -- if you have a lot of older or younger employees, it’s not going to work, Baldwin and Matos both pointed out.And there are more reasons this is unworkable: If you’re a business with a dispersed workforce scattered across lots of different offices all around the country, you may not be able to scale this in every location. If you employ a bunch of people who have a long commute, this isn’t going to cut it either. Workers may not want to schlepp their kids for an hour to get them to day care everyday.Labaton applauded Trump for bringing up the issue, though. “I think it’s great that candidates are even talking about this problem,” she said.She thinks the issue is coming up with the presidential candidates now because Americans are at a breaking point. “More women are breadwinners and that’s changed the dynamics of family and at home. It’s clear that our policies were created in a different era and reflect a different workplace and people are just feeling the pain of that.” She said that nationwide polling suggests that support for quality child care has become a nonpartisan issue.In an ideal world Labaton's group would like to see day care workers making a minimum of $15 an hour and parents spending a maximum of 10 percent of their income on care. Right now in some states parents spend as much as 30 percent, according to one EPI analysis."

Within the next three years, the Fortune 500 coffee company plans to open 15 new stores in diverse medium- to low-income communities across the country. The new locations will partner with local minority women-owned suppliers.Partnering with Starbucks in Ferguson is Natalie Dubose, owner of Natalie’s Cakes and More. Last November, Dubose’s bakery was among the businesses in Ferguson and Dellwood that were burned and vandalized following the St. Louis County prosecutor’s announcement that Officer Darren Wilson would not be charged for killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown Jr.Dubose set up a GoFundMe account which received more than $200,000 in donations. Natalie’s Cakes and More’s “signature caramel cakes” are currently being sold at a dozen local Starbucks.“It was this time last year that we were cleaning up glass and cleaning up debris on the strip of South Florissant Road,” Dubose said. “It was a lot of tears that day, but at the same time it was a lot of love shown that day.”Rodney Hines, Starbucks Community Investment Retail Operations partner, who is leading the diversity initiative, says it’s commitment to collaborations in the community “that’s really going to help address the opportunity divide that exists within Ferguson and beyond.”Within the next year, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Chicago, and the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York will receive new Starbucks sites as part of the diversity initiative.In 2011, the company launched a $5-million loan program for small businesses called “Create Jobs For USA.”Unique to the Ferguson location, however, is Starbucks’ first job training program.“It’s a program we’ll be offering up with a local nonprofit and offering customer-service training,” said Hines. “That’s a skillset we think you can take to Starbucks or anywhere.”Alisha Wrencher, 36, who has worked with Starbucks for over 15 years, will manage the Starbucks in Jamaica Queens, which will be the first store in the initiative to open.“I started as a barista and from then on continued to grow within the company,” Wrencher told The American. “It’s been an amazing journey with lots of opportunities. I started off at 18 years old and became a store manager at 20.”Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III said he is grateful to Starbucks and developers Otis & Clark Properties for recognizing the city’s need for investment, in the wake of unrest and the light it cast on the entrenched problems in north St. Louis County.“With all the things we’ve learned over the past year, I think it’s important that we realize that both our urban communities and our suburban inner-ring communities need investment,” Knowles said. “They need economic development.”For Dubose, the partnership with a national brand was more good news that came from bad.“I’m just grateful that at this time so much has happened,” Dubose said. “So many good things have happened. The sun does shine after that storm.”The story is published as part of a partnership between The St. Louis American and The Huffington Post.Also on HuffPost:"
27,SPORTS,The Warriors Should Go For The NBA's All-Time Win Record,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warriors-all-time-wins-record_us_564f1ed6e4b0879a5b0a7e5f,Greatness like this simply doesn't come along often.,2015-11-20,Point forward Draymond Green and reigning league MVP Stephen Curry (right) are both enjoying stellar seasons thus far.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564f53b21700004000e1a3a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"They say records are meant to be broken, but Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls' 72-win title season from 1995-96 just might be the exception. Or is it?Thanks to one of the NBA's great all-time starts, the 13-0 Golden State Warriors -- fresh off a 23-point comeback win over a feisty and frustrated Clippers team -- should be the team to overthrow that record, or at least make a legitimate attempt. True greatness doesn't come along often, and the Warriors now sit just two wins away from the 15-straight record to start a season, a clip shared by the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and the 1993-94 Houston Rockets. This is rare territory, and who's to say where the team can go from here?Firstly, consider that the defending world champs are still scary young. The average age on their roster is right above the league average at 27.3, but think about its core set of guys -- Draymond Green (25), Klay Thompson (25), Harrison Barnes (23) and Festus Ezeli (26). Reigning MVP Stephen Curry is practically a senior citizen at 27. Moreover, because of the team's tremendous balance and depth, the Warriors are an NBA rarity in that they legitimately play nine, sometimes 10 guys a night.""We have such a deep team that it’s not an issue of running guys ragged out there on the floor with heavy minutes every night,"" Curry told USA Today Sports this week. ""If we take care of our business, the starters don’t need to play 40-plus, the bench comes in and does what they have to do and everybody is taking care of their jobs, so we want to keep that formula.""Moreover, never before has the league's schedule been so kind to its players. Unlike when Jordan's Bulls broke the record nearly two decades ago, we now have a mere 17.8 percent average for back-to-back games, an all-time low. In addition, back-to-backs crossing time zones have been reduced by 18 percent, according to NBA.com, and instances of teams having to play four games in five days have likewise been reduced to an all-time low.Next, let's look at how special this team has become. Naturally, it all starts with Curry, who has gone from good to great to historic. On pace to shatter his own record for 3-pointers made in a single season, the playmaking dynamo averages 34.2 points per game, leading the Rockets' James Harden by a staggering 6 points. But as with the Warriors as a whole, the key word with Curry is efficiency, because he's shooting over 45 percent from distance. Better yet, he converts 52 percent from the floor, a number typically reserved for 7-foot dunkers who live in the painted area. Curry has the keys to the entire offense, and with him running the show, the Warriors constantly create quality looks. It's one of the main reasons why they lead the league in points, points per possession, field goal percentage and 3-point percentage.The team's secret weapon is the two-way balance of its roster, which I described in some detail during last June's Finals. If the Warriors do end up winning 73 games, this will be a key reason why. Versatility has never been more in vogue in the NBA -- can your guys guard multiple positions? Can your big create offense? -- and it's a quality Golden State has in spades. Green, the former second-round pick and All-NBA Defender, enables the Warriors to play positionless basketball. He can check all five spots on the floor, and his effectiveness as a point forward provides the necessary flexibility for head coach Steve Kerr (or interim coach Luke Walton) to rest Curry and Thompson when need be -- or simply play Curry off the ball, which essentially amounts to a rest period anyway. The same can be said about swingman Andre Iguodala, the Finals' MVP, who often flanks Green in the frontcourt. And then there's Barnes, who is the ultimate small-ball four man at 6 feet 8 inches: strong enough to defend bigs on the block, but agile enough to create perimeter mismatches on the other end.Perhaps nobody has a better or more realistic perspective on 72 wins than Kerr, who teamed up with Jordan to help form the backcourt on the famed Bulls team. The Warriors came close last year, winning 67 while having the good fortune of clean health (excluding center Andrew Bogut). And yet, when asked this week if his club could break the record, Kerr told the Chicago Tribune: ""Oh, god no.""Speaking of last season, perhaps the biggest misconception about the Warriors was that their roster lacked defensive toughness and grit. After leading the league in defensive efficiency, they disproved that idea, and this side of the floor has been equally impressive this season. Golden State ranks eighth in field goal percentage against and first in 3-point percentage against. As a result, when they get up on teams, they bury them. It's why they have the best point differential in basketball, hovering around the unfathomable plus-15 mark, and it's why taking the foot off the gas pedal now simply wouldn't make sense. Curry himself summed it up best on Thursday. ""I don’t think great teams really coast through parts of the schedule just because you feel like you have the talent to do it,"" he told USA Today. ""Great teams don't take nights off.""Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report."
28,POLITICS,Obama Administration Takes Deportation Relief For Millions To Supreme Court,Cristian Farias and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dapa-supreme-court-undocumented-immigrants_us_564f4068e4b0879a5b0a97b4,President Barack Obama first announced the program exactly one year ago.,2015-11-20,Millions of undocumented immigrants could receive deportation relief should the Supreme Court allow an Obama administration program to move forward.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564f43211b0000270029e41c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The fate of millions of undocumented immigrants may be decided by the Supreme Court.Exactly one year after President Barack Obama announced sweeping executive actions aimed to protect millions from deportation, the administration appealed to the high court on Friday, seeking a declaration from the justices that the program should be allowed to proceed.The White House needed to move quickly if it wanted the court to rule in the current term, which ends in late June. Even now, the justices retain wide discretion to accept the case, hold it over until the term that begins next October, or reject it altogether.The court's timing has clear implications for the 2016 presidential election. If the court takes up the case and rules against the Obama administration, it will be a blow to Democratic candidates, who have said they would go even further than the president on deportation relief. If the court allows the executive actions to move forward, it will hurt Republicans who vowed to rescind them, since doing so would involve stripping people of benefits they had already received.Obama announced on Nov. 20, 2014 that he would implement a new program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which would allow certain undocumented immigrant parents to remain in the country and obtain temporary work permits. He also said the administration would expand the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which does the same for some undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children. Texas led a group of 26 states to sue the Obama administration over the executive actions on DAPA and DACA, claiming they were unconstitutional and would cause the states harm because more people would apply for driver's licenses, among other arguments. A judge blocked the programs from moving forward, leaving millions of undocumented immigrants who expected relief in limbo. An appeals court upheld that injunction earlier this month.The Obama administration has maintained that the executive actions were constitutional and said it is confident the courts will eventually rule in its favor.More than 4 million undocumented immigrants could be eligible for DAPA and the expansion of DACA, according to the administration and outside group estimates. The three-year permits would allow them to work legally and to obtain driver's licenses.The administration opens its appeal to the justices with a statement from a century-old case -- ""The authority to control immigration ... is vested solely in the Federal Government"" -- and then proceeds to lay out the various reasons why the court should agree to add the dispute to its docket.Among them, the government argues that Congress has already vested the Department of Homeland Security with broad powers to determine “national immigration enforcement policies and priorities” and to establish regulations and policies to that effect.“A principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials,” wrote Solicitor General Donald Verrilli in the government’s legal brief to the court, quoting from a 2012 case that reaffirmed the executive’s prerogatives over immigration issues. “When they encounter a removable alien, immigration officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.”Pointing to “resource constraints” and the government’s historic role in conferring “deferred action” to certain foreign-born persons, Verrilli contended that DHS can only do so much with the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants that reside in the United States, and noted how Congress has directed it to allocate the “necessary expenses for enforcement of immigration and customs laws, detention and removals, and investigations.”Resting on that premise, Verrilli -- who will likely argue the case before the Supreme Court if it agrees to hear it -- then asserted that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which ruled against DAPA and the expanded DACA, made a mistake when it “upheld an unprecedented nationwide injunction against implementing a federal immigration enforcement policy,” and that leaving it in place will allow states to thwart authority that otherwise belongs to the federal government.The 5th Circuit’s decision “will force millions of people — who are not removal priorities under criteria the court conceded are valid, and who are parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents — to continue to work off the books, without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families,” Verrilli said. “And it will place a cloud over the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who came to the United States as children, have lived here for years, and been accorded deferred action under the 2012 DACA policy, which respondents have never challenged.”If the Supreme Court decides to add the case to its docket now instead of later, a hearing would take place sometime in the spring, with a decision expected by the end of June.A spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) declined on Friday to say what the office's next steps would be, but said it plans to continue with the case. ""The president said himself more than 20 times that he didn't have the authority to unilaterally rewrite immigration law,"" spokeswoman Cynthia Meyer said in an email.

30,POLITICS,The Congressional Art Of Negotiating Without Any Leverage,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservatives-omnibus-syra_us_564f5381e4b0879a5b0ac12b,"Hardline conservatives want omnibus concessions, but will they just vote against the bill anyway?",2015-11-20,"""There are probably folks who are willing to take a few crumbs to vote for bad legislation,"" Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told HuffPost. ""I'm not one of them.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564f8f5e1700004b00e1a420.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As conservatives push to use an upcoming spending bill to block Syrian refugees from coming into the country, the far right is running into a difficult question: How do you extract omnibus concessions from GOP leaders when you're going to vote against the bill anyway?It's still unclear exactly what the omnibus will look like. But the must-pass legislation that will fund the government past Dec. 11 will need 60 votes in the Senate and the signature of President Barack Obama. And that doesn't portend well for the support of hardline conservatives who have no intention of ever supporting the measure anyway.One senior GOP aide summed it up this way: You can't ask for concessions when you're going to vote against the bill no matter what.""It shows a fundamental lack of understanding in how the legislative process works,"" the aide said. ""It's hard for them to have any leverage when they've already shown their hand.""But some conservatives do seem to understand that game. And they are trying to conceal their hand. Publicly, at least.""Concessions are a byproduct of a willingness to support the underlying bill or, at a minimum, not working to defeat that same bill,"" Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told The Huffington Post on Friday.The North Carolina Republican, who introduced a resolution to oust now-former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), noted that conservatives are indeed hoping to get policy riders in the omnibus. ""But I only see those negotiations being meaningful if they are willing to ultimately support the final product,"" Meadows said.And that willingness is the real question.""There are probably folks who are willing to take a few crumbs to vote for bad legislation,"" Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told HuffPost on Friday. ""I'm not one of them.""Brooks said he evaluates bills based on whether they are a net gain or net loss for America in his conservative estimation. ""And making a bill a little bit less bad is not the kind of exchange I make,"" he said.For Brooks, the major issue is the additional $25 billion in domestic spending above sequestration levels. That additional money may have already been agreed to in the budget deal from the end of October, but Brooks doesn't see why he should support the bill just because it's already a reality.""Let the liberals in our conference join with the Democrats to pass an appropriations bill that is financially irresponsible,"" Brooks said.On top of the increased spending, some conservatives could vote against the omnibus purely because it doesn't defund Planned Parenthood.But there are signs that conservatives are willing to overlook those realities. Most everyone on Capitol Hill acknowledges -- conservatives included -- that Republicans aren't going to renegotiate spending levels or suddenly block Planned Parenthood. At least, groups like the House Freedom Caucus want GOP leaders to think there's a possibility they could support the omnibus bill.""I don't want to speculate on something I have not seen,"" Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), a new member of the HFC board, said Friday. ""I know that we are trying to address the refugees in the omnibus. Other than that, I am not involved in anything broader at this point.""One senior GOP aide wondered whether there's anything that the Freedom Caucus wants in the bill that would still make it passable for Obama's signature.""Hypothetically the answer is yes,"" the aide said Friday. ""I’m not sure that anything would check the box in both categories, but there seems to be a willingness to look for that common ground.""The aide noted that most members won't announce where they stand on the omnibus until the very end -- either because they are trying to make leaders think their vote is up for grabs, or because they don't want to get ahead of themselves in denouncing a bill they haven't seen. ""So hope springs eternal,"" the aide wrote in an email. ""'Till the end anyway!""One conservative lawmaker told HuffPost Friday that the omnibus was Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) ""first big test.""""Conservatives are looking to see how he handles the next few weeks,"" the member continued. ""Many of us won't vote for any omnibus at the new, higher spending levels, but others might be persuaded by significant policy riders.""The most significant policy rider is shaping up to be one that blocks Syrian refugees from coming to the United States. But if conservatives are just going to vote against the bill anyway, and if GOP leaders are going to need Democratic votes, adding refugee provisions could just complicate the bill.The dynamic of hardline conservatives moving legislation closer to the middle -- a dynamic that establishment Republicans have complained about for years -- just makes the job of Speaker Ryan and other Republican leaders more difficult.If they need a chunk of Democrats to vote for the omnibus, then including provisions that would functionally block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from coming to the United States is a tall task. The delicate art may be in finding a way to appease Republicans but not lose Democrats.What little leverage conservatives have may be just in making sure that Ryan doesn't lose the goodwill he's banked thus far. As Meadows suggested, it's one thing to not support the omnibus. It's whole other thing to not campaign against it.According to House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Ryan has pledged to not pass anything major without a ""majority of the majority. That devotion to the so-called Hastert Rule -- a name that has fallen out of favor since former Speaker Dennis Hastert pleaded guilty to paying hush money to conceal a past misdeed -- probably won't be tested too much on the omnibus. But it's one of the few boxes Ryan has to check if he doesn't want conservatives to completely turn on him.Correction:  Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Paul Ryan's home state. He is from Wisconsin."

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-refugees-american-values_us_564e4afce4b0258edb30c15c,"""Our values are not secondary considerations in the fight against terror,"" Lynch said.",2015-11-20,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the House bill passed on Wednesday requiring Syrian and Iraqi refugees to undergo additional screening ""presents us with an impracticality and an impossibility.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564e4d0d1b0000270029e35d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The nation's top law enforcement official said Thursday she's disturbed by the tone of the U.S. debate over refugees since last week's terrorist attacks in Paris.Attorney General Loretta Lynch said a bill the House passed on Wednesday to add additional requirements to an already-stringent screening process for Syrian and Iraqi refugees ""would effectively grind the program to a halt.""While calling the screening of refugees ""important"" and ""vital,"" Lynch said the process was already rigorous, and that there was already an extra screening process for Syrian and Iraqi refugees in place. It's important to base the debate over refugees on facts, rather than on perceptions originating from a ""place of fear,"" she said.""We need to say, we will not let our actions be overtaken by fear, and we will not allow merchants of violence to rob us of our most precious ideals,"" Lynch stated. ""Our values are not secondary considerations in the fight against terror – they are central to the work that we do, and they are essential to the nation that we protect.""""They are also the reason that we are a target, and they are what terrorists want most to see us abandon,"" she added. ""They want us to live in fear, and we refuse. They want us to change who we are, and what makes us quintessentially American, and that we will never do.""Lynch made the comments at a briefing with reporters alongside FBI Director James Comey at Justice Department headquarters. Comey said the government had perceived no credible threats of an attack against the U.S. similar to the ones in Paris, but said the bureau was keeping close watch on individuals who could be inspired by them.On Wednesday, 47 House Democrats defied a veto threat from the White House to vote for a bill that would essentially end the already-limited flow of Syrian and Iraqi refugees coming to the United States. More than half of all U.S. governors have said they will not accept Syrian refugees, despite the fact that the White House described them as ""some of the most vulnerable people in the world,"" and stressed that many of the people fleeing the Middle East are victims of terrorism themselves.The House bill would require the FBI to conduct a background check on every Syrian and Iraqi refugee applicant and would require Comey -- as well as the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security -- to personally sign off on each individual admitted from those two countries. Comey said it would be ""very, very difficult"" for the bureau to ""say there is zero risk"" for each and every applicant.To have the FBI director make personal guarantees ""presents us with an impracticality and an impossibility,"" Lynch said on Thursday, arguing that the requirement would not provide the safety and security that she believed lawmakers were seeking.""I don't want to downplay anyone's concerns or their desire to keep the American people safe,"" she said. ""What concerns me about the tone is it very much runs the risk of essentially devolving the problem on one group of people and saying, 'If we just fix this one thing, we're done and we're safe.'""That's not the case, she said, pointing out that half of the recent ISIS-related cases involved U.S. citizens. ""My other concern about the tone is that it's in direct conflict with who we are as a nation and our values as a people, and it really does [make] us live and work and operate in a place of fear,"" Lynch said.Also on HuffPost:"
