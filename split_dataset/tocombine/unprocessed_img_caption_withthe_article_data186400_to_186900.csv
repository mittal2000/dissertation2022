They are a lifesaver and the stretchy waistband will expand as you do. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ba2543c00004c000976f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I chuckled to myself recently when I caught an episode of ""Mad Men"" where Trudy Campbell is visibly pregnant. The look was hilarious: Her tops and dresses were absolute tents, which started at her neck and made a triangle around her ballooning belly. Her hair and makeup were impeccable, and there was something charming about her dated look, but I felt very thankful that tents are no longer requisite dress for expectant women. On the other end of the maternity style spectrum is Jessica Simpson, whose pregnancy had been on close watch for the past two years (that's how long it felt, anyway). There were a few times when she kept it chic -- a certain red, clingy dress comes to mind -- but for the most part it was muumuus. Now we have nothing against a beautiful caftan, but when one is in the throes of pregnancy, the muumuu looks more moomoo, if you know what we're saying. We can't all be Victoria Beckham and wear bespoke clothing and Christian Louboutins during gestation. But there's no reason to look like you're hiding your body. Instead, we advocate that you show it off. Rather than spending lots of money on clothes you'll only wear for a few months, choose items that are versatile enough that you can continue to wear, even when you're not pregnant. Even better, just mine your own wardrobe for items that are forgiving enough to fit your gorgeous, growing body.Here, nine must-have tips for looking your best when you're expecting. We promise you'll like them so much, you'll keep wearing them long after that precious bundle arrives. Keep clicking through to see Jessica Simpson's maternity style.Want more?

But she has no problem admitting the incredible access and privilege her fame brings -- especially in the fashion world. In her new interview with Marie Claire (previewed by People.com), the lithe, blonde ""Gossip Girl"" star reminds us once again that she is not like us. ""Maybe it sounds jerky,"" she tells Marie Claire's Nina Garcia, ""but I’m lucky to be on such a fashion-centric show [Gossip Girl]. There’s no designer I don’t have access to."" And on the subject of her future wedding:""What I planned before I got into the business has changed,"" she says. ""Now I'm like, 'Hmm, I wonder what shoes Christian [Louboutin] is going to make me. And which couture house should I go to?' ""But of course. Christian is a FOB (Friend Of Blake), naming a shoe after her, giving her personal style advice and gifting her his entire Spring 2012 collection. In short, it's good to be Blake. To be fair, the star has acknowledged how lucky she is to live a life of fame and fortune. ""For me, this other stuff -- well, the perks -- is not the reason I do the job,"" she once told Interview. ""Couture fashion week, getting to meet Karl Lagerfeld and John Galliano and Christian Louboutin is so exciting. [...] But at the end of the day I wouldn't be there without my job. There are a few things in life that matter above all else: your family, your friends, your loved ones.""And by ""loved ones,"" we assume she means Ryan Reynolds. Some girls really do have all the luck. Read more at People.com and MarieClaire.com and get a glimpse of her Marie Claire shoot below.
