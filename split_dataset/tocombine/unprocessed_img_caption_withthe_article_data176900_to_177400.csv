Well, at least Mitt Romney thinks so.A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure of judging a ""film pitch"" competition at a prominent film festival. In essence, writers, potential screen writers, and current screen writers were given a few minutes to pitch a film. This is a nearly impossible task, as most film pitches to studios and production companies take about twenty to forty minutes to pitch and I've pitched a lot: television episodes, pilots, (I've sold many, some I've not), films, some of which were purchased and made (Wedding Crashers, We're the Millers currently in production), some were purchased and have yet to be made. Maybe they won't be made. Who knows?I saw -- ""judged"" -- a fairly narrow segment of the populace. About sixty people, predominantly between 18-30 years old. There were some college grads, some younger military veterans, some writers older than thirty, etc. Anyway, most were predominantly younger than thirty years of age.They pitched horror films.Now by that, I don't mean they all pitched horror films. I nonetheless calculated about 86 percent of the good, well-intentioned writers who pitched their films to me, EIGHTY-SIX percent of them pitched horror films (keep in mind my calculations were unscientific, as I wasn't writing my Sociology Ph.D dissertation, however 86 percent is about right). And they pitched truly gruesome horror films. A few weren't bad, a couple were good, and two of them coincidentally took place at drive-in theaters in the 1950s and involved psychopaths who engaged in some sort of psychopathic, knife-wielding ""slashing.""After the competition (the winner pitched a comedy -- well, a type of comedy -- that morphed into psychopathic knife-wielding horror film), I asked the participants who weren't too downtrodden that they didn't win or place a simple question: Why? Why pitch a horror film? A slim, very slim minority had a business angle: ""Cheap horror films sell."" Being a writer in this business for some years, I know that to be a sort of canard, one I've been hearing for years, that business angle-horror film paradigm doesn't really pan out -- and on a personal note runs contrary to the advice I give when I'm asked by aspiring writers to what genre they should focus. I always say ""write what you know, what you want to know and what you're passionate about."" I can only hope that the film pitchers that film festival day, the ones that weren't just interested in making a buck, neither knew, nor were passionate about slashing psychopathic killers. That being said, the predominate answer I received from the contestants was: ""I don't know. It seemed right.""Let's board the train and visit ""Art imitates life"" land... just for the sake of argument. Lives are in chaos, we're going through some bad times which are slowly getting better. People, specifically people who want to write films, often sublimate their own horror until it percolates up into a dystopia they believe would make a good film. I understand that and begrudge no one for the effort. In addition, I was at a film festival, there was fun to be had, I'd put it together later. A couple of days ago, after two incongruous events, I was reminded of that Pitch Competition.I was under the weather for a couple of weeks, and didn't properly attend to my dogs. I own a few chiweenies (that's half-Chihuahua, half-Daschund) who became, owing to the recent Los Angeles heat wave, flea-ridden. Yes, I'm a grown man who owns Chiweenies. It's a long story. I'm the guy who adopts Chiweenies at Dog Adoption Fairs. That being said, when I was up on my feet again, I purchased the necessary shampoos, sprays, gel and such and bathed the little guys. Fleas, those parasitic tiny creatures who feed off the blood of the innocent Chiweenie, were in abundance. I found two ticks, as well, which can be equally pernicious and operate much the same way. They're parasites. Anyway, in my own Chiweenie-laden horror film, I eradicated the fleas and ticks.After the flea and tick decimation, I tuned into the news and to not-so-surprised chagrin, watched and listened to Mitt Romney write off about half the country in a speech at a high-end fundraiser, the type of which usually features foods that are puffed and drizzled with honey and such.And then I thought about my own family, those here, those no longer with me.My grandparents were immigrants who came here seeking freedom, asking for nothing except a bit of opportunity. Both sides of my family received a helping hand during the Great Depression: My grandfathers worked and worked hard under FDR's W.P.A. program. My maternal grandfather, a tailor by trade, dug ditches twelve hours a day. After the Depression, after the WPA helped him feed his family in exchange for ditch-digging, the market dictated a need for tailors and a tailor he was once more. In fact, he lived to the age of 99 and was a proud dues paying member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the ILGWU (and from what I understand, one of the longest continuous members of said union). My grandfather was many things -- however, through the Romney lens he was a tick. A flea. A parasite.My dad, who passed six years ago, served in the United States Army, was honorably discharged, sought to better his life by way of a college education. Like millions of returning vets, he received help paying his tuition by way of the GI Bill. He graduated, he paid his taxes, he didn't exactly live the American Dream, but nonetheless he lived an American life. Look through Romney's glasses. My dad? A flea, a tick, a parasite.My mother receives social security, money she's paid into a system that is now returning some of it to her. Flea, tick, parasite.Myself, well, I graduated from UCLA. That's the University of California which receives funding, in part, from the state of California, by way of taxation. Or as Governor Romney might put it: an evil redistribution of wealth. Perhaps I should have gone to Cayman Islands State, majored in Wealth Creation and spent my life circling crowds who eat puffed and drizzled foods, crowds where such redistribution is frowned upon. However, I did not. I went to UCLA, I worked (bartender), I studied and I took out (gasp) student loans. I paid them back and went on my way.Sadly, ironically, it is that very same institution, UCLA, where my severely disabled daughter is treated continuously at their wonderful Department of Neurology. Again, partly funded by taxes. Perhaps more ironic, UCLA treated me when I was diagnosed with cancer eleven years ago. I've been cancer-free for ten years owing to UCLA, that freight train, that receptor of wealth redistribution. My daughter and I are part of that group of Americans that Mitt Romney pays no heed, that group about whom he could care less. While attempting to pursue the American Dream, one in which we are supposed to teach our children is attainable and moreover worth obtaining, she and I have become... fleas, ticks, parasites. Or the ""47 percent of the people that will never support [Governor Romney]."" The ones he and his supporters ""have to forget about.""Why in the hell is this man running for President of the United States? The UNITED States. All of us. The ones who work hard, pay taxes, get sick, attend state institutions, occasionally need a helping hand, and on the whole, are completely well-intended. Mitt Romney certainly has the right to run for the presidency, he certainly has the money to do so. However, in his ice-cold calculation of how to ""win,"" he's left out a basic element: the human beings who actually live and work in the United States.If you can relate to even a fraction of my narrative, you are, in Mitt Romney's pet-grooming comb, just another flea, a tick, a parasite. Don't think for a second that that the speech Mr. Romney made was a one-off. That screw-the-forty-seven-percent-who-don't-support-me line is the former governor's narrative. It always has been, as it will always continue to be. He's told you he doesn't care about you, now it's on tape, it's easy to understand. And it's frightening if only because it's so real. So possible. You see, he is the protagonist in a hellish story wherein slashes to programs that help veterans, students, the elderly, severe cuts to medical research facilities, like the one that treats my daughter and saved my life, are made manifest in some unspoken, worn-out economic theory that has never worked and will never work.In fact, while watching and listening to Governor Romney's remarks, I thought to myself, ""Wow, this would make a great horror film."" For the sake of at least half the country -- scratch that, all the country -- I do hope on election day we vote united in deciding that film ought never be made."

Those kinds of insinuations when talking about, and to, those who are (or are assumed to be) in lower income brackets, have a long and elaborate history in electoral politics. So we wanted to ask you, what do you think? Are Mitt Romney's comments the reflection of an out of touch rich man who doesn't understand the lives of most Americans?

It means if you get rid of those proteins that kill, the oocytes or specialised egg cells can actually repair their DNA and that has never been known before,"" said lead author Clare Scott, an associate professor and oncologist at The Royal Melbourne and Royal Women's Hospitals.Between 50 to 80 percent of eggs survived in these mice.""These were enough to result in normal fertility in those mice and they could produce normal pups. Those pups went on to be fertile themselves and lived a normal lifespan with no evidence of tumours or other abnormalities,"" she said by telephone.Scott's colleagues are conducting similar trials on human egg cells to see if the two proteins work in the same way. If all goes well, they hope a drug can be designed to block the two proteins from killing egg cells.""If that pans out well, then we would hope that a drug that could target (the protein) puma ... be provided as a therapy for three to six months during cancer therapy,"" Scott said.Such a drug that blocks the action of the proteins could possibly prevent premature menopause or infertility, she added.""In a woman, premature menopause is caused by (early) death of specialised egg cells.

That year one man had the visionary idea that homosexuals were a ""cultural minority"" and could organize themselves to create a community and fight for their human dignity and civil rights. Sixty years later that vision has developed into a worldwide civil rights movement and inspired the creation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities on every continent. The man who had that exceptional vision was Harry Hay.An actor, communist, labor organizer, teacher, musicologist, gay theoretician, and political activist, Harry Hay left a lasting mark that continues well into the 21st century. Hay was active in the avant-garde arts movement of 1930s Los Angeles, where he worked as an actor. He participated in the San Francisco General Strike of 1934 and fought against fascism, racism, and anti-Semitism in the 1940s. In 1948 he conceived of and organized the first sustained gay activist group in America, the Mattachine Society, kicking off the modern American gay freedom movement. Throughout the 1950s he conducted research into areas of anthropology, science, history, and mythology for evidence of what he termed ""my people"" -- gay people. In the 1970s he worked for and supported Native American struggles and helped to define and bring together the gay men's group the Radical Faeries. Hay continued theorizing and organizing his ""people"" and supporting social justice for all people, right up to his death in 2002.In honor of the 100th anniversary of Harry Hay's birth, the Harry Hay Centennial Committee and the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies at the City University of New York are presenting a four-day conference from Sept. 27 to 30, 2012, in New York City, exploring Hay's life, ideas, and the multiple facets of LGBT life that Harry Hay himself pioneered. The conference is organized around four major themes: arts, political activism, spirituality, and sexual identities. It will feature panels, lectures, films, and live performances from scholars, activists, and artists all exploring the evolution of LGBT life in the 60-plus years since Hay founded the modern American LGBT movement.The event gets started on Thursday, Sept. 27, at 7 p.m. at CUNY Graduate Center with a keynote address by anthropologist and author Will Roscoe, followed by a staged reading of excerpts from playwright John Maran's award-winning play about Hay, The Tempermentals. Other featured keynote speakers through out the conference include feminist historian Bettina Aptheker, poet Cheryl Clark, and LGBT historian John D'Emilio. Over 100 scholars, artists, and activists will be participating in the conference, including authors Mark Thompson and Perry Brass and historians Jonathan Ned Katz and Susan Stryker. Playwright Tony Kushner has prepared a staged reading of an excerpt from his most recent play, The Intelligent Homosexual's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures. Film programming includes Hope Along the Wind: The Life of Harry Hay, presented by director Eric Slade, and a selection of contemporary West Coast queer avant-garde short films. A Saturday evening program at the New York LGBT Community Center features live performances based on aspects of Hay's life, hosted by the New York (dis)Order of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and emceed by Justin Sayre with Agnes de Garron, Reverend Yolanda, and Pistol Pete, as well as fashions by Cody Sai and a host of surprises, followed by a masked Mattachine-style procession to an after party at the historic Stonewall Bar.

Lessons of Paris Even as they were,2012-09-22,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 17: A sign from a protester with 'Occupy Wall Street' lays torn on the ground during demonstrations on September 17, 2012 in New York City. The 'Occupy Wall Street' movement, which sparked international protests and sympathy for its critique of the global financial crisis, is commemorating the first anniversary of its earliest protest. The main protest began in front of the New York Stock Exchange and was preceded by a series of days where free courses were offered on such topics as Marxism, anarchism, education and finance. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d4721f00002e0123adff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bloomberg View: Two Occupy Wall Street slogans merit close scrutiny. The first -- “We are unstoppable! Another world is possible!” -- is a popular chant, heard in every recent protest march. The second -- “The only solution is world revolution” -- is featured prominently on posters, picket signs and websites.These mottos permeated this week’s demonstrations commemorating the one-year anniversary of the group’s takeover at Zuccotti Park in New York. Both call for transformative social change, displaying an optimism undeterred by the dashed hopes of revolutions past.This confidence is rooted in the exuberant triumphs of last autumn, when tens of thousands of Occupiers engaged in civil disobedience and protests in dozens of countries, and focused the world’s attention on their concerns. For two months at Zuccotti Park and elsewhere, the services usually associated with government and industry -- food, medicine, security, even libraries -- were ably provided by cooperative organization. Occupiers invented new practices of governance, such as the human microphone and the general assembly, and established an innovative financing network.More from Bloomberg View -Poverty, Inequality Aren’t as Bad as You Think -How to Lose Weight Fast the Deutsche Bank WayIt is hard to imagine that such a tiny model could serve as a blueprint for a global system, without losing its essential democratic spirit. History is littered with so many failed utopias that the notion itself has become anathema. Yet the ideas Occupy pushed into the public consciousness, rooted in anarchist history and theory, have a long and powerful precedent -- and may prove more durable, and more influential, than the movement itself.The CommuneIn the 19th century, radicals had an occupation of their own to look to for inspiration: the Paris Commune. For two months, beginning in March 1871, working people seized control of governance in the French capital. They coordinated a vastly larger space than Zuccotti Park, and they did so in the midst of a desperate war. With Emperor Napoleon III’s armies captured or destroyed, and Prussian forces nearing the suburbs of Paris, French leaders decided to surrender. But the people themselves refused, ousting timid officials and choosing to defend their city.Besieged and bombarded, with fading hopes of relief, Parisians rushed to build a new society. Improvised committees set up schools, distributed food and clothing, and instituted an array of democratic reforms. Elected delegates received nominal salaries and could be recalled at any time. Women were promised equal pay; marriage laws were liberalized.Even as they were raising barricades against inevitable attack, Parisians took time to pronounce their ideals to the world. In their many declarations, they urged other communities to establish their own autonomous collectives, with power over taxes and expenditures, policing and education, and the distribution of goods and services. At the vision’s core stood “the absolute guarantee of individual freedom and freedom of conscience.” Assault by reactionary French forces came in May. After a week of street fighting, the commune was destroyed. In the following days, as many as 50,000 communards were executed.The experiment ended tragically. But its short-lived success had offered proof that working people could govern a metropolis along democratic lines, and the ordeal of Paris soon became a cornerstone of radical thought. For decades, it was studied by everyone, from Karl Marx to his anarchist rival, Mikhail Bakunin. Almost anything one needed to know about creating revolutionary institutions, they believed, could be gleaned from the experiences of the Paris commune.Lessons of ParisPeter Kropotkin, a Russian aristocrat who abandoned privilege for a life in anarchism, derived an elaborate blueprint for the future based on the lessons of Paris. Believing that the commune had failed because the inhabitants were unable to feed themselves, he foresaw a Europe divided into large, autonomous regions. Each would be capable of growing its own food and manufacturing the basic goods necessary to thrive. Industries would be scattered “so as to bring the factory amidst the fields,” a visionary ecological idea that he thought would not only reduce pollution but allow individual workers to divide their energies between “brain work and manual work.”Writing on the eve of World War I, he imagined a post- capitalist society consisting of dozens, even hundreds, of independent socialist collectives, each essentially similar to those in Paris or Zuccotti Park. “These communes,” he predicted, “would federate to constitute nations in some cases, even irrespectively of the present national frontiers.” Each district would be unique. One might possess mineral deposits and another might support extensive fisheries. Goods could be distributed between them by railways and shipping routes, with the workers of these transportation networks themselves organized into an industry-wide commune.These weren’t mere visions. At crucial moments in the past century, local democratic organizations have undertaken the functions of governance. Municipal collectives appeared repeatedly during general strikes. In 1919, Seattle unions shut down the city’s shipping and steel facilities. Workers took over the city government, ran the utilities, and provided food and policing. The only vehicles allowed on the streets were those sanctioned by the strike committees. During the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, anarchist collectives governed large sections of Catalonia, while fielding formidable, democratically regulated militias in the fight against fascist armies.Short-lived and fragile, these experiences all shared the basic principles -- exemplified by democratic decision-making, individual self-fulfillment and opposition to capitalism -- that were cherished by the Occupiers at Zuccotti Park. Taken together, they fall far short of a global revolution, but at the very least they prove that another world is possible.(Thai Jones is an assistant professor of history at the Bard College MAT Program and the author of “More Powerful Than Dynamite: Radicals, Plutocrats, Progressives, and New York’s Year of Anarchy.” The opinions expressed are his own.)Read more Echoes columns online.To contact the writer of this post: Thai Jones at tjones@bard.edu.To contact the editor responsible for this post: Timothy Lavin at tlavin1@bloomberg.net."

The requests together come to $707 million.Apple wants the injunction to cover ""any of the infringing products or any other product with a feature or features not more than colorably different from any of the infringing feature or features in any of the Infringing Products.""Such a wide-ranging sales ban could result in the extension of the injunction to cover Samsung's brand-new Galaxy S III smartphone.'RECTANGLES WITH ROUNDED CORNERS'Samsung, in a filing to the U.S. court, asked for a new trial to be held.""The Court's constraints on trial time, witnesses and exhibits were unprecedented for a patent case of this complexity and magnitude, and prevented Samsung from presenting a full and fair case in response to Apple's many claims,"" Samsung said.""Samsung therefore respectfully requests that the Court grant a new trial enabling adequate time and even-handed treatment of the parties.""In a separate statement, Samsung lamented the fact that patent rulings should cover issues such as the shape of the product in addition to technological points.""It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies,"" it said.The Korean firm earlier this week said it plans to add Apple's new iPhone 5 to the existing U.S. patent lawsuits, stepping up its legal challenge as the two companies seek to assert rights to key technologies.Apple said it wanted the court to award it damages that reflect ""a rational and fair effort to address Samsung's willful misconduct that has and will impose lasting harm on Apple.""The Korean firm was the world's top smartphone maker in the second quarter of this year, shipping more than 50 million phones, nearly double Apple's 26 million iPhone shipments.Both companies are raising their marketing spending to promote their latest products ahead of the year-end shopping season.(Reporting by Miyoung Kim and Sung-won Shim; Editing by Hugh Lawson)"

Check a bag, that's $25. Buy a sandwich for the flight, that's another $10. Ask for a blanket or rent a movie? Be prepared to fork over some serious cash. But when it comes to in-flight Internet, some airlines are moving in the opposite direction from charging additional fees, at least for now. JetBlue announced this week it will offer free Wi-Fi for in-flight use starting early next year. (Hat tip: Time's Moneyland Blog.)The Wi-Fi won't just be free, according to the company's blog, it's also supposed to slay any other airline's Internet service in terms of connectivity speed. According to the chart JetBlue published with its announcement on Tuesday, the new satellites that its planes will be using to connect passengers to the Internet are 100 times more powerful than the old-school satellites other (unnamed) airlines have been using. However, JetBlue did leave the door open to charging fees in the future -- and said its free basic Wi-Fi service was just ""to start.""Some other airlines are testing a modified version of free in-flight Internet, but those feel more like access to a digital SkyMall than an actual Internet connection. (Don't get us wrong, perusing SkyMall for Beer Pagers and DNA analysis kits for your pet is a totally legit way to spend a 4-hour flight.)For example, Delta allows passengers to connect for free to Amazon.com and several other content partners, but doesn't let fliers roam the Internet wilds. Meanwhile, the airline collects a small commission on purchases made in-flight on Amazon, according to the The Street. American Airlines and US Airways also have offered similar limited Internet services, which nudge passengers towards certain online shops with time-limited Internet access.Untethered access to the Web, however, will cost you anywhere from $1.95 to $17.95 on American, for example, depending on flight distance and length of access. Virgin America offers in-flight Internet priced from $4.95 to $17.95. These and other major airlines in the United States offer Internet services through Gogo, a mile-high Internet service provider. Airlines might have good reason to offer Wi-Fi for free: Much like free booze, Internet access could help subdue nervous or impatient passengers. In an era where flights can be stuck on the tarmac for hours and hours and passengers can come unhinged without access to Words With Friends, free Internet access could be a very good thing."

When the plane landed, Bea was discovered dead and Rizer, shaken, started to look for answers.A Vogue covergirl and model for Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Clinique, Louis Vuitton and Versace, Rizer began blogging about her life with her family and three dogs in December 2010 on a blog she dubbed ""Bea Makes Three."" After the titular math suffered a subtraction, Rizer took to ""Bea Makes Three"" to discuss her dog's death and her frustration with United Airlines' response. When we arrived in San Francisco to pick up our dogs we drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hanger were told simply, “one of them is dead” by the emotionless worker who seemed more interested in his text messages. It took thirty minutes for a supervisor to come to tell us, “it was the two year old.” Subsequently we requested that our dog be returned to us and were told that she had been delivered to a local vet for an autopsy. Whatever thread of trust remained between us and United broke and we then insisted that she be returned to us for our own autopsy by our trusted veterinarian, Shann Ikezawa, DVM from Bishop Ranch Veterinary Center. Over the next two hours the supervisor’s lie unraveled as it became clear that Bea was right behind a closed door the whole time and he had been discussing how to handle the potential liability with his boss who had left and sticking to the divert and stall tactic that they had been taught. Eventually Bea was returned and we drove her to the vet at midnight.Accord to Rizer, her veteranarian concluded after a necropsy that Bea had succumbed to heatstroke.""It will be two weeks since Beatrice was killed by United Airlines and since then United has refused to give us any information about what happened to our beloved little Bea other then, 'our internal investigation does not show any irregularities, as evidenced by the fact that your companion dog and other animals on board did not suffer the same fate,'"" wrote Rizer. In a statement to the airline claimed it was waiting on the necropsy results to finish its inquiry into the dog's death.""We understand that the loss of a beloved pet is difficult and express our condolences to Ms. Rizer and her family for their loss,"" United Airlines' spokesperson Mary Ryan wrote in a statement to The Huffington Post. ""After careful review, we found there were no mechanical or operational issues with Bea’s flight and also determined she was in a temperature-controlled environment for her entire journey. We would like to finalize the review but are unable until we receive a copy of the necropsy.""United Airlines did not respond to Rizer's claim that the airline had ""called our veterinarian and fabricated a story about having an email from me, authorizing them to obtain the necropsy results."" E! News reported that the $1,800 fee the Rizer family paid to transport their two dogs is being refunded and United Airlines also covered the cost of the necropsy. On its website, United Airlines stresses the excellence of its PetSafe program. Earlier this year, the Department of Transportation reported that 46 animals died while flying on commercial airlines in the U.S. in 2011. This marks an increase from the previous two years. Thirty-nine animals died in 2010 and twenty-two died in 2009, the NY Times reported.  Maggie Rizer, her husband Alex, her son Zander and their two dogs."

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c51172000004e00fd8535.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Years ago, a board member brought me into a corporation to lead a team in creating two products that he felt would boost the stock price. Here's how it happened. In my vigorous interview of him for The Wall Street Journal, he described how the firm could fall behind without them, and I became fascinated by their capacity to scale. He read my article.Then, much to my surprise and his, as he later told me, as he is a very deliberate thinker, he called and offered me the job of leading the new product research and design team. Ah, what an unexpected and serendipitous opportunity for me to see business from the other side, I thought, so I rashly agreed.1. When a Random Event Sucks You Into an Opportunity... ""Success is random so court serendipity"" ~ Frans JohanssonThere were only a couple of problems with my coming into the company as an outsider. As a journalist, I'd never led a team, did not have the relevant technical experience and was ten years or so younger that the mostly ex-military and highly technical folks I was to lead. Oh, and my new boss had expected that he'd be leading the team, bringing in more resources to do so. That may be why, in his welcoming email, he directed me to the wrong office and didn't inform my direct reports that I was arriving that day.One upside of being a business reporter is that it's actually an accelerated learning experience. Yet, just as it's one thing to ""consult"" with a firm, or report on it for a news story and quite another to actually be in the trenches, day to day, and attempt to accomplish something, especially when others are motivated to make you fail. Cobbling together what I learned by interviewing and observing business leaders, here is the approach I boldly, well blindly, took and what I learned during that sometimes wrenching yet ultimately satisfying project team experience:2. Upfront, be Upfront ""You don't have to be loud to lead"" ~ Erika AndersonWhen I finally found my office and introduced myself I asked for an all-hands meeting. I'd brought along a longtime friend and unflappable graphic facilitator. Instead of the traditional introductions I just asked them to tell me their names, going around in a circle. Then I took an approach I learned from Richard Branson.I said that I had three goals for the meeting, one for ""us"" and one for each of them, and that Tom, our graphic facilitator, would draw our unfolding conversation pictorially on the white wall so we could literally focus, not on me or one of them, but on our conversation as this crucial first experience together.3. Craft a Clear Top Goal to Create the Collective Context for Making Better, Faster Choices ""Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships"" ~ Michael JordanLike reverse engineering, starting by clarifying the end goal helps us stay on track as we move towards it. So we began by discussing the main benefits that the two products should offer and the markets they could serve, then prioritized both. The more specific we were in that conversation, the more quickly and easily we could communicate and agree on changes as we learned more in later stages.4. How Can We Each Use Our Best Talents on Our Strongest Interests? ""Look for the best in people to build a fantastic team"" ~ Richard BransonNext, in light of our shared picture of the most important attributes we wanted in our two products, each person was asked to specifically describe the parts of the project where they most wanted to take the lead and why. In this step you learn a lot about your colleagues, from how much they understand themselves, how willing they are to be upfront about what they really want, and how articulately they can express themselves.• To identify your strengths consider reading Now, Discover Your Strengths by Marcus Buckingham. To better understand your temperament, read Mindset by Carol Dweck and Learned Optimism by Marty Seligman.Gradually, as we moved around the circle, it also became clear where we had overlapping talents and gaps. With that knowledge on the table, I asked for people to voluntarily negotiate who would take what lead when there were overlapping interests or talents. We then discussed what talents were missing and their recommendations of whom, in the company, would be the best fit to recruit and how.• To learn more about productive collaboration read Collaboration by Morten Hansen.5. Agree on Rules of Engagement to Reduce Ambiguity and Hasten Trust ""Teams should be able to act with the same unity of purpose and focus as a well-motivated individual."" ~ Bill GatesCounter-intuitively, rules, when jointly agreed upon, give a group more freedom. People are more likely to trust each other and get in sync faster when they have a shared view of acceptable behavior. This proves true whether they think they know each other well, or have never before worked together. Yet these benefits of better performance often don't happen when those who must follow the rules are not allowed to participate in adjusting them, as some grieving family members believe, with the Rules of Engagement that Seal Team members must follow. Among the rules to consider include:• What technology will be used to collaborate so they everyone is seeing the same information, discussions and progress• What purposes call for in-person meetings, and how will they be conducted?• Exactly how do we collectively agree on changes?One of my favorite rules of engagement is to be what Erika Anderson dubs a ""fair witness"", objectively reporting what happened, how it didn't work, what we then did differently and what's happening now.• Learn how to reinforce your rules of engagement and productively communicate by reading Talk, Inc. by Boris Groysberg and Michael Slind; Well Said! By Darlene Price; and Crucial Conversations by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan and Al Switzler.6. Take a Lean/Loose Approach to Productivity and Camaraderie  ""The pool of shared meaning is the birthplace of synergy"" ~ Kerry PattersonThere are many payoffs for getting specific sooner. Collectively discussing these three topics upfront jump started our understanding of each other, set a direct and collaborative tone to the culture we jointly created - and would have not worked nearly as well if I'd not said, upfront, that after we had this very focused, lean meeting in the morning (and it did take up the full morning) we would have a ""loose"" time over a luscious lunch I'd ask my new secretary to have delivered at noon.I'm betting that Eric Ries would agree that a ""lean"" approach is helpful for any kind of organizational innovation. I'd cribbed that lean/loose lesson from a SVP at Siemens whom I'd interviewed in Berlin.• Learn more about the power of simplifying processes in The Laws of Subtraction by Matthew May.7. Stick to Our Sweet Spot of Shared Interest ""We need to play each others instruments.""~ Steven JohnsonThat expressly identified shared sweet spot can be your group glue, holding your team together through rancorous conversations or otherwise tough moments. With the steps we made that morning we set the stage to be more frank and open with each other sooner, especially about where we disagreed, and when we needed help or had failed. We were more likely to connect rather than choke under pressure. I am not saying it was always easy after that first day yet the hard times were resolved more quickly and cleanly and were able to become close-knit around our strong sweet spot of shared interest and commitment. One sign that we, as a team, were in sync with each other was that we recognized, at almost the same time, when someone wasn't using her best talents nor adhering to our Rules of Engagement and were in unanimous agreement to ask her to leave.• Learn more in Change-Friendly Leadership by Rodger Dean Duncan; Being Wrong by Kathryn Schulz, and Leading So People Will Follow by Erika Andersen.8. Set the Stage for You and Your Company to Succeed, Going Social ""Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than in the one where they sprung up.""~ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.Those ""Us"" developing steps lay the groundwork, even today, as companies recognize that, to survive, they must become more social enterprises. Yet ""social"" only scales when both our behaviors and our technology reinforce collective action. I write this as Saleforce is hosting its huge Dreamforce conference, double the size from last year, across the Golden Gate Bridge from me in S.F.As Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer suggest in The Progress Principle, we all yearn for more meaningful work where we get to use our best talents together, aptly supported by social enterprise software that leverages our capacity to accomplish greater things together.Then we are more likely to learn and innovate faster, by making what Peter Sims calls Little Bets. In so doing we became more resilient together, and better able to stay flexible and to recognize and seize the random events that Frans Johansson describes in The Click Moment that leads to breakthroughs.• To learn more about supporting your organization in going social, read Socialized by Mark Fidelman; Social Business by Design by Dion Hinchcliffe and Peter Kim; The Pursuit of Social Business Excellence by Vala Afshar and Brad Martin; and Smart Business, Social Business by Michael Brito.Now, are you ready to turn the page to the adventure story, you are truly meant to live as a sought-after Opportunity Maker with and for others?"
