It wants major brands and their suppliers to commit to stop discharging potentially harmful chemicals in waste water by 2020.Concerned about toxicity to aquatic organisms and the fact some do not biodegrade easily, the European Union has restricted the industrial use of some of these chemicals but there are no rules on the sales of textiles containing their residues.Greenpeace said 12 of the 27 articles it tested contained residues of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), used in textile manufacturing which it said can break down into hormone-disrupting chemicals when released from garments during washing.In five items, the group said it also found per- and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) used to make garments water repellent. Five articles tested positive for phthalates, used in printing designs on clothing, and three for antimony, a compound used to manufacture polyester.The chemicals Greenpeace tested for have been commonly used in textile manufacturing, but are gradually being phased out by some brands due to concern about their polluting impact.Reuters could not independently confirm Greenpeace's findings, which two of the companies sought to play down.Armani said its products were ""absolutely safe for consumers"" as it complied with international guidelines that were more restrictive than EU environmental requirements.Armani said it has committed to abolish all chemicals which could cause environmental damage to production sites by 2020 and is in discussion on this with environmental groups.Louis Vuitton said all its products fully complied with international environment and safety standards, including the children's ballerina shoes and sneakers that Greenpeace tested positive for PFCs. Louis Vuitton said both had lower concentration levels than international rules required.However, Louis Vuitton said it shared Greenpeace's concerns as it recognised ""the intrinsic hazardous properties"" of the chemicals used in the industry and said it was working hard to exceed current environmental standards.Hermes, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Dior and Marc Jacobs were not immediately available to comment.An industry consultant privately criticized the Greenpeace campaign, but declined to speak publicly.Some big brands have become highly sensitive to scrutiny of their environmental standards as shoppers demand more information about how products are made, with companies like H&M and Adidas keen to portray themselves as ""green"".They are among two of the 20 brands Greenpeace has already persuaded to make the ""Detox"" pledge, helped by supporters bombarding the firms via social media. The only luxury names to sign up so far are Britain's Burberry and Italy's Valentino.Greenpeace said many of the products in its study were labelled as ""Made in Italy"", usually a by-word for quality, but still contained similar chemical residues to garments made in developing countries.""It's time these luxury brands lived up to their reputation as fashion trendsetters, and started leading the toxic-free fashion revolution,"" said Chiara Campione, a campaigner for Greenpeace Italy.Many clothing retailers have already agreed to make their clothing PFC-free but some outdoor brands have said there are currently no PFC-free technologies that would provide the same lasting level of weather protection.

(AP Photo/HO)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb150c63c000020010bc787.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Laura ZuckermanFeb 16 (Reuters) - Underground sensors have detected excessive radiation levels inside a nuclear waste storage site deep below New Mexico's desert, but no workers have been exposed and there was no risk to public health, U.S. Department of Energy officials said on Sunday.An air-monitoring alarm went off at 11:30 p.m. local time Friday indicating unsafe concentrations of radiation inside the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in what DOE officials said appeared to be the first such mishap since the facility opened in 1999.As of Sunday, the source of the high radiation readings had yet to be determined, and a plan to send inspection teams below ground to investigate was put on hold as a precaution.""They will not go in today. It's a safety thing more than anything. We're waiting until we get other assessments done before we authorize re-entry,"" DOE spokesman Bill Mackie said.The facility, located in southeastern New Mexico near Carlsbad, is designed as a repository for so-called transuranic waste, which includes discarded machinery, clothing and other materials contaminated with plutonium or other radioisotopes heavier than uranium.The waste, shipped in from other DOE nuclear laboratories and weapons sites around the country, is buried in underground salt formations that gradually close in around the disposal casks and seal them from the outside world.No workers were underground when the apparent radiation leak was detected in the vicinity of the plant's waste-disposal platform, and none of the 139 employees working above ground at the time was exposed, the Energy Department said.The alarm automatically switched the underground ventilation system to filtration to keep any releases from reaching the surface, DOE officials said.Subsequent testing of surface air in and around the facility showed the incident posed no danger to human health or the environment, Mackie said.Air-monitor alarms at the facility have been tripped in the past by malfunctions or fluctuations in levels of radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas. But officials said they believe this to be the first real alarm since the plant began operations.Just a few dozen essential personnel, including security officers, remained at the site over the weekend.Inbound waste shipments had already been suspended at the plant since a truck caught fire there earlier this month in an accident that left several workers suffering smoke inhalation.""We're in shutdown mode,"" Mackie said.The facility in the Chihuahuan Desert normally receives up to 6,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste a year and employs more than 800 workers. The site is expected to continue to accept radiological materials until 2030, Mackie said.

2,BUSINESS,Raising Taxes On The Rich Would Reduce Income Inequality: Larry Summers,Jillian Berman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taxes-rich-larry-summers_us_5bb30862e4b0480ca6620a4f,"“Today’s tax code allows a far larger share of the income of the rich to escape taxation than the poor or middle class,” Summers",2014-02-17,"Former US Tresury Secretary Larry Summers addresses the Wall Street Journal CEO Council on November 19, 2013 in Washington,DC.

But closing tax loopholes that largely benefit the wealthy -- like the capital gains exemption, certain estate tax provisions and corporate tax breaks -- could help middle-class and poor Americans, he wrote.“Today’s tax code allows a far larger share of the income of the rich to escape taxation than the poor or middle class,” Summers wrote. “Closing loopholes that only the wealthy can enjoy would enable targeted tax measures such as the earned-income tax credit to raise the incomes of the poor and middle class more than dollar for dollar by incentivizing working and saving,” he continued. Summers' comments come as 1-percenters are getting increasingly defensive about their right to take home so much of the income pie. Venture capitalist Tom Perkins stoked ire last month when he compared progressive activism against the superrich to Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany. Other superrich guys, along with the Wall Street Journal op-ed page, ran to his defense, arguing that the rich are getting unfairly picked on. Former Mitt Romney advisor Greg Mankiw didn’t go that far in a New York Times op-ed titled “Yes, the wealthy can be deserving,” but he argued that tax-dodging corporations and billionaires aren’t the norm. Rather a large share of wealthy people's income ends up in government hands, he wrote.Still, some studies have backed up Summers' idea that reforming the tax code could make a dent in income inequality. According to a 2013 study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, when you consider things like sales and state and local taxes, the poor fork over a larger share of their income to Uncle Sam than their richer counterparts.And over the past several decades, lawmakers have actually made that dynamic worse. A June 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that policymakers have exacerbated income inequality over the last several decades by making the tax code less progressive -- in other words, cutting taxes on the rich. In addition, a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in May indicated the same dynamic exists in other developed countries as well. The more lawmakers cut top tax rates, the larger share of income the wealthy take home, the study found. "

Others question whether temperatures are in fact rising.The fact that temperatures have risen more slowly in the past 15 years despite rising greenhouse gas emissions has emboldened sceptics who challenge the evidence for man-made climate change and who question the need for urgent action.Kerry, who faces a politically tricky decision at home on whether to allow Canada's TransCanada Corp to build the Keystone XL pipeline despite the opposition of environmental groups, had little patience for such sceptics in his speech.""We just don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation,"" he said.

PARAMOUNT TO UNIONSOpposition to UAW involvement stemmed from concerns among many workers that a union would strain cordial relations with the company, which pays well by local and U.S. auto industry standards.Some experts contend that VW needs a labour union in the United States to help set up a works council in Chattanooga, where it builds the mid-sized Passat Sedan.""Representation in Chattanooga is paramount to the unions at VW,"" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the Center of Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen.""The U.S. are the last blank spot on VW's global map where labour does not yet have a voice. The VW group's works council will do what it can to change that and it's fully backed by management.""Following a 2011-12 sales surge in the United States, VW has hit an American pothole in the road to global supremacy and needs more models designed for U.S. consumers and manufactured completely in the region, analysts say.The German group, languishing in the bottom third of U.S. quality rankings, ousted its divisional chief Jonathan Browning in December after U.S. deliveries fell 7 percent in 2013 as a push into competitive midsize cars lost traction.To counter this underperformance, VW is planning to spend $7 billion in the region and build a sport-utility vehicle tailored for the North American market."
