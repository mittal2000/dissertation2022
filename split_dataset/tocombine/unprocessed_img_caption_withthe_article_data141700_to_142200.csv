1,WELLNESS,9 Ways The Government Shutdown Could Affect Your Health,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-public-health_us_5b9d900be4b03a1dcc898a05,"The government shutdown is underway, as a dispute about President Obama's Affordable Care Act led to a partisan stalemate",2013-10-01,"Carla Silvestre, 4, and Frankie Galarza, 4, left rear sitting, follow along as they read through a nutrition booklet while attending a nutrition education class at the Dallas County WIC office in Dallas, Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2006. Dallas County's WIC office, which provides food stamps, help with healthcare and education to new and expectant mothers, gave its first class aimed at curbing the nation's rising obesity rates from the very start. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d900b2200003000d9ae38.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The government shutdown is underway, as a dispute about President Obama's Affordable Care Act led to a partisan stalemate over a funding bill. The ACA will go forward, with health exchanges opening today, but that doesn't mean the shutdown won't have an impact on the health of Americans. Here are nine ways the shutdown could affect your health, a reminder of just how crucial government resources can be in protecting and improving our health and well-being. Medical research won't move forward The National Institutes of Health will not add new patients to life-saving clinical trials during the shutdown, reports NBC. And that could delay crucial new trials. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, told the Wall Street Journal that about 200 patients, 30 of them children, who would have otherwise been admitted to the NIH Clinical Center this week will be turned away. He noted that most of the kids are cancer patients.Nutritional support for women and children will be suspended  While most government ""safety net"" programs, like retirement and welfare, won't be shut down, that's not the case for a program that ensures nutrition, counseling and food benefits to low-income pregnant women and new mothers. The USDA's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) will not stay in operation, HuffPost reported on Saturday.""States can probably shelter families receiving WIC from the effects of a shutdown for a short period, but it could be a real problem if it lasts more than a few days,"" policy analyst Elizabeth Lower-Basch of the Center for Law and Social Policy told HuffPost's Arthur Delaney. Environmental health protection will be compromised The good news is that Environmental Protection Agency employees who focus on public health and safety (including use of food, drugs and hazardous materials) will be allowed to come to work. The bad news? Those who work toward the long-term safety of human health will not. In other words, as HuffPost's Kate Sheppard reported, only employees whose work relates to an ""imminent threat"" to public health will be allowed to continue. Not included in this category? People who are working to clean up 505 Superfund sites in 47 states.Food safety could be at risk  The Food and Drug Administration will put half its employees on furlough. While a skeleton staff will handle high-risk recalls, regular food inspections will be suspended, reports NBC. Obamacare will be marginalized The Affordable Care Act has been implemented, uninterrupted, despite the shutdown, but that doesn't mean things will be seamless, reports BuzzFeed's Evan McMorris-Santoro:Health policy observers say that by blowing the opening of health care exchanges off the front page and making it more difficult to correct glitches in the online registration system -- the means by which most young people will interact with Obamacare -- a shutdown has the potential to significantly impact the health care law, at least in the near term.You might not be able to go for that run  In light of some of the more dire consequences for vulnerable sections of the population, this might seem trivial. But closure of federally-funded recreational areas like bike and running paths and public parks could have a negative effect on public well-being. Many who are unable to afford gym memberships rely on public areas to get regular exercise. And research shows that availability of public parks is associated with overall public health, disproportionally benefitting under-served populations. ""Public parks are critical resources for physical activity in minority communities. Because residential proximity is strongly associated with physical activity and park use, the number and location of parks are currently insufficient to serve local populations well,"" wrote researchers of a survey on park use, published in the American Journal of Public Health.Neither will new drug approvals What's more, the FDA will be unable to continue its review and approval process of new drugs. Here are five drugs that were scheduled for October reviews and that may now face delays under a government shutdown. They include a new osteoporosis drug for postmenopausal women and a new approval for the cancer drug methotrexate to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Workers are no longer safe  Federal occupational safety inspectors are part of the 800,000 furloughed federal employees, meaning that inspections in the workplace -- at construction sites and other potentially hazardous environments -- will come to a stop, reports CBS. The flu (and other diseases) may spread HuffPost's Adam Goldberg reported that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have to stop their seasonal influenza program, which has been critical in tracking and preventing the spread of flu in previous years. And the CDC's work abroad to track and limit the spread of infectious disease will also come to a halt, NBC reports. Want to learn more? See our coverage here."

Someone who CLEARLY doesn't know the bride and groom and is just there to make a buck and then move on to the next ceremony? Since the whole point of the wedding is the getting married part, it's important to consider who'll be doing the marrying -- and to ensure that the marriage will be legal. Here are three things to think about before you choose the person who'll be standing up there with you.1) Make sure he's legally allowed to marry you. If you choose someone who marries people as part of his job description -- priest, rabbi, justice of the peace--you're probably in the clear. But if you're considering having a friend do the deed, make sure an Internet minister is legit in the state where you'll be exchanging vows. (I can tell you from experience that you CAN'T legally get married in Connecticut by someone who's been ordained online. Oops.)See more: 10 Things He's Thinking When You're Naked 2) Ask if she's OK with nontraditional readings. Maybe you want to get married by a priest -- but you don't want your wedding to be all Corintheans this and Genesis that. Double-check that your officiant is OK letting your guests do readings from The Velveteen Rabbit or your favorite Bruno Mars song.See more: The 10 Prettiest Hair, Nail and Makeup Looks for Fall 20133) Reach out to your recently married friends. I don't have a lot of friends who would call themselves religious -- but I DO have a lot of friends who have gotten married within the past five years. If you're struggling to find an officiant, ask your friends who they used -- and ask them who they considered but didn't choose, so you don't wind up interviewing the same duds.Who do you want to marry you?

Specifically, divorced and unmarried men have higher rates of mortality and are more prone to substance abuse and depression than married men.The paper, titled ""The Influence of Divorce on Men's Health,"" concluded that divorced and unmarried men have mortality rates up to 250 percent higher than married men. The causes of premature death for divorced men include cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke. Divorced men are also more prone to various diseases, ranging from common colds to life-threatening health problems like cancer and heart attacks.Divorce can also affect men's mental well being; the researchers found that divorced men are more likely to partake in risky activities such as abusing alcohol and drugs, and divorced or separated men have a suicide rate that is 39 percent higher than that of married men. Depression is also more common for divorced men than married men, and divorced men undergo psychiatric care 10 times more often than married men do.Dr. Ridwan Shabsigh, the president of the International Society of Men's Health, explained the importance of the study's findings in a press release. “Popular perception, and many cultures as well as the media present men as tough, resilient, and less vulnerable to psychological trauma than women. However, this article serves as a warning signal not to follow such unfounded perceptions,” he said. “The fact is that men get affected substantially by psychological trauma and negative life events such as divorce, bankruptcy, war, and bereavement. Research is urgently needed to investigate the prevalence and impact of such effects and to develop diagnosis and treatment guidelines for practitioners.”This isn't the first study to look at how divorce affects people's health. In August, a study out of Finland found that antidepressant use spikes in the months preceding divorce, and a study published in July 2013 found that children of divorce may be more susceptible to serious health problems later in life.Check out the slideshow below for even more interesting divorce-related research findings.Keep in touch!

Amendment 64, which was passed by approximately 55 percent of Colorado voters overall in 2012, enjoyed an approval rate of 70-90 percent in the state's ski towns.There's so much excitement over its legalization in fact that Adam Raleigh, owner of Telluride Bud Co., tells The Durango Herald that many tourists who were in town for the Telluride Blues and Brews Festival mistakenly thought recreational marijuana was legal already. “I heard you guys passed a marijuana law. I haven’t done it since high school, college. I would just like to try it out again. It’s been 20, 30 years,"" Raleigh told The Durango Herald, adding that he's also overheard tourists say they're planning on bypassing the slopes of Utah for Colorado next year. But that doesn't necessarily mean that pot use will be rampant on the slopes -- more likely off of them, housed in cabins with the fireplaces and s'mores since public consumption of the drug will still be illegal.“The use of marijuana is not permitted at the ski area, and no smoking of any kind is permitted in the lift mazes or on the chairs,"" Adrienne Saia Issac, Arapahoe Basin's marketing and communications manager told Onthesnow.com.  “Patrol handles on-mountain infractions on a case-by-case basis. Consequences of committing any on-mountain infraction may include having your lift ticket or season-pass privileges revoked.”Similar opinions were also expressed at Vail Resorts -- which owns Vail, Beaver Creek, Keystone and Breckenridge ski resorts -- the Loveland Ski Area and 49 Degrees North in Washington. Colorado recently became the first state in the U.S. to adopt rules for retail marijuana shops in the state. And just this month, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice will let Colorado's new marijuana laws go into effect.Colorado's adult residents may possess up to an ounce of recreational marijuana, but adult tourists are only allowed to purchase up to a quarter of an ounce. Most mountain towns in Colorado have approved sales of recreational marijuana -- excluding Vail and a few others which have imposed bans of some sort on recreational marijuana businesses. Officials in Steamboat Springs have passed an emergency moratorium on the formation of marijuana clubs within city limits.“It's really going to be a question of how much of an impact the community of Steamboat Springs wants to see when it comes to marijuana,"" Steamboat Springs Public Safety Director Joel Rae told Steamboat Today.

7,FOOD & DRINK,The Secret to Making the Ultimate Chocolate Gelato,"Zester Daily, Contributor
Zester Daily: The culture of food and drink.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chocolate-gelato_us_5b9d8d72e4b03a1dcc896868,"Extra virgin olive oil, double-dutch dark chocolate powder and chocolate pieces make this gelato silky-smooth.",2013-09-30,2013-09-26-130909.ZD_.ChocolateOliveOilGelato2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-26-130909.ZD_.ChocolateOliveOilGelato2.jpg,"By Caroline J. BeckThis past summer, I was overcome by the latest trend to turn just about anything into a frozen edible. From Bloody Mary popsicles at brunch to Saffron Courvoisier granita for a dinner finale, sassy sorbets were all intriguingly laced with herbs, spices or hip new libations. But when the bloom falls off the rose-flavored sherbet, I am left with a classic flavor that almost never disappoints: chocolate.I'll admit that a plain cone of old-fashioned chocolate ice cream somehow doesn't measure up anymore. In order to make me swoon, it has to be ridiculously rich and creamy. It has to be dark and intensely flavored. And it has to scream chocolate. In short, it has to be that Italian-style frozen dessert called gelato.Related: Rhubarb compote makes a magical sorbet There are three big differences between ice cream and gelato. First, commercial ice cream frequently uses whole eggs and additives to stabilize the mixture. Gelato just employs yolks. Second, ice cream requires a greater percentage of cream than milk -- this is partly because milk produced in the U.S. is not nearly as rich as that from Italy. Third, the amount of air that is whipped into ice cream while turning it into a frozen state is almost four times that of gelato. The industry calls it ""overrun."" I call it buying a box of air. Ever wonder why a carton of ice cream feels like it doesn't weigh much? Typical off-the-shelf cartons in the U.S. hold up to 80 percent overrun. A true gelato won't exceed 20 percent.I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that this particular recipe rests on the shoulders of many chefs and cookbook authors whose exhaustive work with frozen desserts guided my explorations. But during the course of 17 tests with varying degrees of success, I discovered there is nothing exceptionally difficult about making great gelato. Luckily, I also discovered three ingredients that help this recipe deliver on the silky-smooth and deep dark promise: extra virgin olive oil, double-dutch dark chocolate powder and 72 percent chocolate pieces. Related: Cinnamon ice cream is great in a pinchEvery recipe's success is based on using quality ingredients. So I rounded up the best mild-flavored Arbequina extra virgin olive oil I could find, some double-dutch dark chocolate powder (I'm partial to King Arthur Flour's blend of dutch and extra-dark black cocoa) and lots of Valrhona Araguani 72 percent chocolate fèves, or small bean-shaped disks. You can use any high-quality bittersweet chocolate bar, but the higher the percentage of cocoa butter, the better.With these ingredients in hand, I knew my own version of chocolate heaven was within reach. Once again, I broke out my ice cream partner-in-crime, my Vitamix. The blender makes almost instant work of preparing the custard that any tabletop ice cream maker can turn into gelato in less than 30 minutes. And when it comes to chocolate gelato, I am all about instant gratification.Intensely Rich Dark Chocolate Olive Oil GelatoMakes 6 servingsIngredients2½ cups whole milk1½ cups heavy cream5 egg yolks¾ cup sugar½ cup double-dutch dark cocoa powder4 ounces 72% chocolate bits or broken bars1 teaspoon vanilla extract¼ teaspoon instant espresso powderPinch kosher salt3 ounces mild-flavored extra virgin olive oil, preferably ArbequinaDirections1. Place all ingredients but the olive oil in a high-speed blender (must be capable of generating frictional heat of about 160 F).2. Turn blender on to its highest setting and process for 6 minutes.3. While continuing to run on high speed, pour in the olive oil and process for 2 minutes. The mixture should reach a temperature of 185-195 F.4. Pour mixture into bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours until well chilled. At this point, the custard can rest as long as overnight before processing.5. Turn mixture into an ice cream or gelato maker and process according to manufacturer's directions.NotesFor more flavor, many additives like chopped nuts can be incorporated during the ice cream making process. I included chopped hazelnut chocolate bars added in the last 10 minutes of processing and sprinkled more of the same on top for a garnish.Preparation alternative: You can make the custard using traditional methods with a double boiler set over medium heat to melt the chocolate, cream and milk. Separately, beat the eggs and sugar into a ribbony texture and slowly, laboriously, stir the mixture, along with the other ingredients, into a creamy consistency. But I vote for simplicity and speed and will use my Vitamix for a flawless finish every time.Top photo: Chocolate olive oil gelato. Credit: Caroline J. BeckCaroline J.
