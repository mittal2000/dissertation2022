0,POLITICS,It Looks Like Nothing Will Stop Ferguson From Prosecuting Protesters,Mariah Stewart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-protesters-prosecution_us_5717e5f6e4b0c9244a7abc1b,"""That's up to the prosecutor,"" the mayor said.",2016-04-21,Protesters blocked traffic outside the Ferguson Police Department in March last year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS -- The city of Ferguson, Missouri, has a new police chief and a fresh deal with the Justice Department meant to eliminate the abusive policing practices that drove unrest following the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 2014. Yet the St. Louis suburb is still prosecuting demonstrators arrested on questionable charges during those months of protests.There was the case against Rev. Osagyefo Sekou, who was arrested while on his knees praying outside the Ferguson Police Department just over a month after Brown’s death. In February, a jury found Sekou not guilty of a failure-to-obey charge in less than 20 minutes. There was the decision by one of Ferguson’s part-time prosecutors to wait until the trial was set to begin before dropping charges against six individuals arrested during a vigil a half-year after Brown’s death. There was the partially successful prosecution of a freelance journalist found guilty of failure to comply with a police order while she stood on a sidewalk covering another protest.In a St. Louis County courtroom last week, a part-time prosecutor was trying to convict protester Keith Rose on a failure-to-comply charge for an arrest that took place two days after Brown’s death. J. Patrick Chassaing -- who, along with Ferguson's part-time chief prosecutor Stephanie Karr, works for a law firm that profits off the county's fractured network of small municipalities -- spent much of Rose’s trial focused on the defendant's social media posts and attacking his political views.Chassaing repeatedly referred to Rose as an ""anarchist"" and even read three different dictionary definitions of the term to Rose on cross-examination.“When you say you’re an anarchist … you’re an anarchist. You’re not going to obey the law,” Chassaing said to St. Louis County Circuit Judge Joseph Dueker in reference to the defendant's tweets. The prosecutor maintained that the social media posts showed Rose’s “state of mind.”Dueker, who had also overseen Sekou's trial, dismissed several of Chassaing’s attempts to submit certain tweets and Facebook posts as evidence. “I’ll determine [whether] these tweets do go to his state of mind,” the judge said.In another case against a protester arrested on the same day as Rose was, Chassaing argued that the simple fact of Mike Lhotak's arrest was sufficient evidence of his guilt on a failure-to-comply charge. At a hearing Tuesday on the Justice Department's consent decree with Ferguson, U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry said it would be unconstitutional for a prosecutor to make such an argument and encouraged Ferguson officials to look into the matter.Both Rose and Lhotak are now waiting for the judge’s verdict to arrive in the mail. While many protesters arrested in Ferguson agreed to plea deals in order to avoid a strung-out series of court dates, Rose told The Huffington Post that he’s glad he and several other protesters went to trial because “it holds the city accountable.”Ferguson's prosecutors “can do whatever they want and then they bill the city for what they did,” Rose contended. ""Then the city is left holding the bill for these cases that aren’t in anyone’s best interest,” he said.Indeed, there’s something of a perverse incentive for the city’s part-time prosecutors to drag out questionable cases. Those who represent Ferguson can bill for hours that go beyond the retainer paid to the city prosecutor. In January, Ferguson paid $6,270 to Curtis, Heinz, Garrett & O’Keefe -- the firm where both Chassaing and Karr work -- for prosecuting cases against protesters, according to Stephen Deere of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Successful prosecutions could also potentially help shield the city from civil right lawsuits filed by those who were wrongfully arrested during the Ferguson protests.For the past several months, Karr has faced public scrutiny of her work as city prosecutor. The Justice Department’s report on Ferguson police specifically mentions Karr prosecuting a father with two counts of parental neglect in December 2014 for letting his children urinate in a bush. The report also cited an email exchange that Karr had with the court clerk in which the prosecutor admitted that she made defendants pay tickets if their attorneys went into “constitutional stuff.” During a sitdown interview with HuffPost last month, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said he’s staying out of municipal court matters, noting that the Justice Department report criticized him for getting involved in a case.“As far as the prosecutor's discretion, for the past 18 months we’ve been told to stay out of matters of the court. So now you’re asking me to stick my nose in the prosecutorial discretion. That’s up to the prosecutor,” Knowles said.Referring to Karr, the mayor said, “I would hope that the prosecutor exercise discretion in what she’s prosecuting. But that’s still the privy of the prosecutor.”Local advocate Felicia Pulliam, who served on the Ferguson Commission created by Missouri's governor, described Karr as “a huge part of the problem” and said her influence could impede change in the city government. “As long as she is here, I don’t understand how any change is going to take place,” Pulliam said.But the excessive prosecution problem isn't even confined to the city prosecutor and her part-time attorneys.Many who were arrested in Ferguson -- including reporters from HuffPost and The Washington Post -- have been prosecuted by the St. Louis County Counselor’s office, even though county officials have conceded they lack the jurisdiction to pursue alleged wrongdoing that took place in Ferguson. Many are facing charges under a potentially unconstitutional ordinance that makes it unlawful to interfere with a police officer “in any manner whatsoever."" Municipal court records indicate that several individuals who were arrested on such charges many months ago now have warrants out for their arrest for failure to appear in court and answer these problematic cases.Editor’s note: Ryan J. Reilly, who contributed to this story, is facing charges in St. Louis County Municipal Court in connection with his arrest in Ferguson on Aug. 13, 2014."
1,POLITICS,Republicans Want To Force The Library Of Congress To Use 'Illegal Alien',Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/library-congress-illegal-alien_us_5718eef3e4b0479c59d73c5d,So what if the library decided there are better terms?,2016-04-21,"The Library of Congress has the gall to think ""illegal alien"" isn't the way to describe a human being.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571934541600002b0031c5e1.jpeg?cache=YvKM5L2i0F&ops=crop_0_18_4411_2376%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans want the Library of Congress to keep using the term ""illegal aliens,"" whether it wants to or not.The subcommittee tasked with the library's appropriations approved a measure on Wednesday that would effectively force the library to use the term in its subject headings, even though many consider the phrase pejorative.Decisions on bibliographic records are not typically made by politicians -- especially the House Appropriations Committee, which is meant to set funding levels for the entire government. The subcommittee was, in fact, discussing a bill to fund the legislative branch. But immigration terminology took up a significant chunk of the hourlong meeting, Roll Call reported.The measure was responding to the Library of Congress' decision in March to stop using ""illegal alien"" in subject headings and replace it with ""non-citizens"" and ""unauthorized immigration.""That had been a victory for immigrant rights advocates, who have urged news outlets, other organizations and individuals to stop using ""illegal"" to describe human beings. (The Huffington Post uses the term ""undocumented immigrant."") Dartmouth College, its student organization Coalition For Immigration Reform, Equality and DREAMers (CoFIRED), and the American Library Association had publicly called for the change.But Republicans didn't like the Library of Congress' decision and deemed the appropriations process the right place to overturn it. They added this language to the legislative appropriations bill: ""To the extent practical, the committee instructs the library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in Title 8 of the United States code.""Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), chairman of the subcommittee, argued during the Wednesday meeting that they were simply trying to ensure the Library of Congress matches the language of the U.S. legal code, not politicizing an issue.""There should not be a micro-managing of terminology with the Library of Congress,"" he said.But the measure isn't about the Library of Congress conforming its terminology with that of the entire U.S. Code -- just Title 8, which deals with immigration. No one at the meeting denied that the move was related to the library's decision on ""illegal aliens.""If Democrats don't like the term ""illegal aliens,"" they should introduce bills to change the U.S. Code, Graves said. ""This is just asking the library to maintain that consistency with what is in the United States Code, and I don't know how anyone in this room could declare that politicizing the issue,"" he said.A spokesman for Graves argued that the Library of Congress had announced its decision without a public comment period to avoid giving Congress or Americans a say in the matter and that the Appropriations Committee therefore had to stop it. The Library of Congress did not respond to a request for comment, nor did CoFIRED. The American Library Association declined to comment until the bill language was posted.Democratic members of the subcommittee asked Graves and other Republicans to reconsider including the provision and let Congress debate the Library of Congress' subject headings elsewhere.""Are we going to do this every time the Library of Congress is petitioned for these little business kind of decisions?"" Rep. Sam Farr (D-Calif.) asked.Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said she hoped they could ""make a decision not to be the word police in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee."" She was the only subcommittee member to vote against the bill. A better place to debate the terminology, she and other Democrats argued, would be in Congress as a whole. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), who is not on the subcommittee, introduced a bill this month to require the Library of Congress to use the term ""illegal aliens.""Republicans at the subcommittee meeting maintained that the appropriations bill was the best venue for hashing out the issue. Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) said that to stop using the term ""illegal"" entirely ""would be a compromise in principle.""But he suggested that ""illegal immigrant"" might be an acceptable compromise.""I don't see them as aliens,"" Rigell said. ""You know, the idea that we update language, that just makes sense to me. They didn't land here on a spaceship and most people, if you met them in a grocery or something, they wouldn't describe those who came here illegally as aliens."""
2,POLITICS,Lawmakers Respond To Democracy Spring Protests With Call For Democracy Hearings,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democracy-spring-letter-legislation_us_571930d3e4b0d912d5fe034d,Almost 100 lawmakers are asking for hearings on five bills.,2016-04-21,About 100 lawmakers responded to the Democracy Spring protests with a call for hearings on the legislation endorsed by protesters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571931402200003600254300.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The recent Democracy Spring protests in which 1,400 activists were arrested this month have prompted nearly 100 members of Congress to call for hearings on voting rights and campaign finance reform legislation.Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), a leading proponent of campaign finance reform in Congress, organized fellow Democratic lawmakers to send a letter to the Committee on House Administration and to the House Judiciary Committee, asking them to hold hearings on five pieces of legislation: the Voter Empowerment Act, Government By The People Act, Democracy for All Amendment, Automatic Voter Registration Act and Voting Rights Advancement Act. The measures are intended to create a public financing system for congressional elections, overturn Citizens United v. FEC and other campaign finance-related court decisions, and expand voting rights.In recent years, Republicans have staunchly opposed campaign finance reform. They have also advanced legislation at the state level to make voting more difficult while refusing to update the 1965 Voting Rights Act after it was gutted by the conservative Supreme Court majority in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision.The Democratic lawmakers reference these changes in their letter, which was published on Thursday. ""The two basic imperatives of a functioning democracy -- the right to vote and the right to have your vote mean something -- are under assault,” the letter reads. “Spurred by the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder, partisan operatives in state legislatures are crafting new ways to limit Americans access to the ballot box. At the same time, the corrosive effect of big money on our political system -- an effect exacerbated by the Citizens United decision -- has left many Americans wondering whether their ballots can ever compete against the power of a privileged few.”A release sent out by Sarbanes’ office notes, “The letter came shortly after thousands of people from all over the country joined each other on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to call on Congress to fight big money in politics and return to a government of by and for the people.”Read the letter below:"

5,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Is Raising Money Hand Over Fist -- And Spending It The Same Way,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-fundraising-reports_us_571840e6e4b0c9244a7ae1c5,The latest campaign finance reports show the two Democratic candidates raised far more than the three Republicans.,2016-04-21,Sen. Bernie Sanders raised $46 million for his presidential campaign in March. He spent the same amount and still trails Hillary Clinton in cash on hand.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5718417d2200003600254113.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The small-donor machine built by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has raised by far the most money of any candidate in the presidential race this year. The only problem: He's spending the most by far, too.Sanders raised $46 million from more than 900,000 donors in March, and spent the same amount, according to a Federal Election Commission disclosure report filed Wednesday. Hillary Clinton, the leader in votes and delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination, raised $29.3 million in March and spent $32 million. “Bernie’s grassroots campaign has now out-raised Secretary Hillary Clinton for three months straight,” Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, said in a statement.The Clinton campaign ended March with $29 million in cash on hand, compared with Sanders’ $17 million.“We head into the homestretch of the primary in strong financial shape with the resources we need to continue to run a competitive race through the end of the primary and the road ahead,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.Sanders continued to rely almost exclusively on repeat small donors to fuel his insurgent bid. Clinton’s campaign raised at least $5.6 million from donors giving the maximum $2,700, while collecting $11 million from small donors giving less than $200.Clinton has raised the most money for the entire campaign cycle, with $191 million. Sanders is close behind, with $186 million.Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting Clinton’s campaign, also raised $11.8 million. Most of the super PAC haul came from just five donors giving $1 million or more. Hedge fund billionaire James Simons donated $3.5 million, Haim and Cheryl Saban gave $2 million, hedge fund billionaire Donald Sussman gave $1.5 million, and medical device heir Jon Stryker donated $1 million.The three Republicans still in the race for their party’s nomination raised far less than the two Democrats. Billionaire eccentric Donald Trump received -- mostly from himself -- $14.5 million, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) raised $12.5 million, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich took in $4.5 million. Each campaign spent close to the amount raised.Trump, the Republican leader in votes and delegates, loaned himself $11.5 million.Cruz and Kasich received help from an array of super PACs, including one whose sole purpose is to prevent Trump from obtaining the GOP nomination.Our Principles, the Never Trump super PAC, raised $8.3 million in March. It received seven-figure contributions from four donors totaling $5.7 million. They were $2 million from shipping tycoon Richard Uihlein; $1.7 million from Michael Vlock, the husband of real estate heiress Karen Pritzker; and $1 million each from investor Cliff Asness and Warren Stephens.The team of pro-Cruz super PACs raised a combined $8.3 million -- not including transfers between each other. Two pro-Kasich super PACs collected a little more than $3 million combined."

Mayor Eric Garcetti's proposal would provide more than $86 million for affordable housing projects throughout the city.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571848b81600002b0031c3f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Behind the Hollywood glamor, Los Angeles has the United States' largest chronically homeless population, which has swelled to more than 12,000 people. Now, the city plans to increase funding by more than $100 million to tackle the issue. Mayor Eric Garcetti's plan for the next fiscal year, beginning in July, would provide $138 million in homeless services, much of which would be used to build permanent, affordable housing for low-income communities. The proposed budget is more than quadruple the $34 million allocated for the current fiscal year.""Los Angeles is on the path to strong economic growth, and we need to make sure that prosperity extends to all,"" Garcetti said in a statement accompanying the proposal on Wednesday.The city is home to one third of the nation's chronically homeless, a population that has grown by 55 percent since 2013. Homelessness as a whole in the area, including both Los Angeles and the surrounding LA county, is up 12 percent.However, the city has come under fire in recent years for what many have called the ongoing criminalization of homelessness. LA city council recently made it easier to confiscate homeless people's property. And critics have lambasted plans to reimpose bans on living in cars. Many have pointed not towards New York City as a leader in tackling the homelessness crisis, after Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $41.1 billion affordable housing plan.Others have already expressed concern with how Garcitti's proposal will actually be funded, and the Los Angeles Times notes many of those sources of revenue don't exist yet.The suggested homelessness budget, for example, assumes $20 million in income from so-called “linkage fees” — a levy on real-estate developers that can be used to build low-income housing. LA, however, does not currently collect such fees. Garcetti has advocated doing so but has not presented a concrete plan to the City Council for approval.But Garcetti said after the announcement that the proposal was""very conservative"" and ""bold."" ""This commitment represents a housing first strategy that we know works ... that came from LA but that has not been scaled up enough to deal with the ongoing onslaught of new homeless individuals we see on our streets,"" he said, according to NBC.While this new proposal does represent a significant increase in funding next year, the city's administrative officer Miguel Santana pointed to the need for steady funding over the long-term in order to adequately help the homeless, the Guardian reports.“If a new funding source is not established at this time next year, then this funding source is in jeopardy and all of the programs it is supporting are in jeopardy,” Santana said at a briefing for reporters.Garcetti's budget still needs to gain approval from the full city council on June 1."
7,POLITICS,GOP Lawmakers Are Already Planning To Bail On Their Own Convention,Igor Bobic and Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-convention-senators-attending_us_5718f4f1e4b024dae4f14546,Awwwwkward.,2016-04-21,GOP front-runner Donald Trump has promised to put on a show in Cleveland.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57193b682200002900254324.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Several Republican lawmakers up for re-election this year are planning to avoid the chaos of their party's presidential convention and stay home. Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, said he was skipping the Cleveland event in order to campaign in November.“I have to campaign for re-election, and I have always done that when I’m up,” McCain told reporters this week.McCain attended and spoke at the GOP convention in New York City in 2004, however, when he was similarly up for re-election. He also spoke at the party’s 2012 convention in Tampa.Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), who's been getting clobbered by Democrats for his role in blocking President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, said he's only going to the convention if he can find a cheap place to stay.""I will do something different and maybe stay in hotels or motels I can buy a night at a time,"" he said on a Wednesday conference call.New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte said in a CNN interview last week that it was “unlikely” she would attend the convention, adding she would be “focusing on my voters in New Hampshire."" North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr said he would be “more valuable outside of Cleveland than inside of Cleveland.” Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, perhaps the most endangered Senate Republican, is also staying home. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said he is planning on attending “but things could change.”Sen. Dan Coats (Ind.), who is retiring at the end of the year, said his colleagues are safer staying away from the “potentially toxic” event.“You’re better off being in your own state, running your own race and not being caught up in all the machinations that may take place at the convention,” he said.“This one is potentially toxic,” he added. “You don’t see too many candidates endorsing anybody for that very reason. You endorse Trump and the Cruz people are mad, you endorse Cruz and the Trump people are mad.”The situation is perhaps most awkward for Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), who represents the state where the convention is being held. Portman, who is facing a tough re-election fight, told USA Today that he would keep a low profile at the convention and spend “very little” time there. ""Like, very little,"" he stressed. Rather than being associated with a potential horror show, Portman will instead hold his own “mini-convention” at a community college that will feature “high-profile speakers” and training sessions for volunteers. As if to make amends even further, the senator will spend part of the convention week “building a Habitat for Humanity house in Cleveland.""Sen. Dean Heller (Nev.) said he may skip the convention “over concerns of his own safety.” “Things could get pretty testy,” he said. “Frankly my biggest concern is security, whether or not I feel it is safe enough to attend a convention.” Indeed, there may be ample reason for concern. The GOP front-runner has repeatedly suggested that “riots” would take place in Cleveland if he is denied the nomination. Over the weekend, Donald Trump again warned the Republican National Committee it could face a “rough July” if it doesn’t treat him fairly. The city of Cleveland is preparing for such a scenario, purchasing riot gear and plastic ties used for arrests. But even some former GOP presidential candidates have decided to pass on Cleveland. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who delivered a speech during the 2012 convention in Tampa, gave CNN a flat “No” when asked if he would be attending. Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) may also skip the event, according to The Washington Post.There are signs of trouble in the festivities leading up to the convention as well. Joe Walsh, guitarist for the rock group The Eagles, on Thursday canceled an appearance at a concert he initially believed was a non-partisan event for veterans when he discovered it was actually a kick-off event for the GOP convention.Walsh said in a statement that he is ""very concerned about the rampant vitriol, fear-mongering and bullying coming from the current Republican campaigns,” adding that he ""cannot in good conscience endorse the Republican party in any way.""Businesses like Microsoft and AT&T, as well as big-time party donors who usually help fund the festivities at conventions, are also feeling the heat, The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month. On Thursday, advocacy organization Latino Victory Fund launched a campaign calling on Microsoft to “take a stand for Latinos” and cancel its sponsorship of the convention due to the “the hate, bigotry and ignorance that has fueled Trump’s campaign.”Correction: This article erroneously described Joe Walsh as a keyboardist. He is lead guitarist."

Each year, Hubble releases a new spectacular image to commemorate the anniversary of its launch.The star at the center of the nebula, which gives off a glowing effect, is between ten and twenty times the mass of the Sun. The nebula’s bubble-like form is a result of strong stellar winds pushing gas and dust into a spherical shape.To show how far the technology has progressed, NASA/ESA resurfaced an image from 1998 showing the Bubble Nebula."
9,POLITICS,Immigration Detainees Begin Hunger Strike At Georgia Center,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-detainees-hunger-strike_us_57194fd3e4b0d0042da8bfb1,Detainees and guards at the  rural facility clashed last year.,2016-04-21,"Detainees at Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Ga., are escorted through a corridor in this file photo. The center is the site of a hunger strike. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57195099160000e40031c648.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two undocumented immigrants locked in Stewart Detention Center in rural Georgia are refusing food, authorities said Thursday.The protest, described as a hunger strike by an immigration attorney, comes a few months after a major disturbance at the for-profit detention center, which contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.ICE, which issued a statement confirming two inmates were rejecting food, didn't provide details and declined to make the inmates available for telephone interviews, citing privacy concerns. “ICE takes very seriously the health, safety, and welfare of those in our care and we continue to monitor the situation,” the agency said. “ICE’s Stewart Detention Center is staffed with medical and mental health care providers who monitor, diagnose and treat residents at the facility.”Attorney Helen Parsonage, who represents several clients detained at Stewart, said the hunger strikers were protesting the length of their detention. Under U.S. policy, ICE is required to review each immigrant detainee’s case after 180 days. Those who don’t present a danger of flight, violence, terrorism or spreading an infectious disease must be released if they are unlikely to be returned to their home countries in the near future. “There are a number of detainees at Stewart Detention Center that are being held, despite the fact that they have a final deportation order -- no contest, no nothing,” Parsonage told HuffPost, citing information from her client. Parsonage said she represents one of the detainees refusing food. Her client, a stateless Palestinian who she wouldn't name for fear of jeopardizing his case, originally was placed in deportation proceedings for working without authorization on his student visa. But in his six months of detention, ICE has been unable to secure travel documents to his birth country or an alternative third country. “It’s a mess,” Parsonage said. “All he wants is to either be let out or sent home. He’s in his 20s and misses his mother. He wants to go home. If you’re going to deport him, do it. If you can’t deport him, which I think is the case, then let him go on an ankle bracelet.” Stewart Detention Center, located outside the southwestern Georgia town of Lumpkin, was the site of a major protest in September that erupted into tumult between detainees and guards. Authorities quelled the unrest with non-lethal force. Guards punished several detainees with solitary confinement, including some who said they weren't involved in the protest. Detainees, activists and lawyers said the protest was motivated by the length of time in detention -- even for those who agree to be deported -- along with harsh punishments for rules infractions, including solitary confinement, and poor quality of the food, which often consists of potatoes served three times a day. Anton Flores, an activist with Georgia Detention Watch who toured the detention center last week, said its population had dwindled in recent weeks. “Given their remote location, they are having difficulty maintaining a sufficient medical staff,” Flores told HuffPost. “So they’ve had to reduce their population.” ICE did not immediately comment on why the detention center is housing fewer immigrant detainees.

Mali's conflict may be over, but its border areas remain deeply unstable, with jihadist militant groups still believed to be operating.They fled in 2013. Thousands of Tuareg herdsmen, farmers, artists, musicians and their families, trekking across the Malian desert border to Burkina Faso on foot, by camel or by donkey, to escape the fabled, broken city of Timbuktu and other parts of northern Mali. They had expected it to be a temporary relocation, but three years after French forces pushed back militant groups – including Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) – more than 33,000 Malian refugees remain in Burkina Faso. They are living in camps managed by the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Burkinabe government – often alongside their herds of cattle, which they brought with them – in hot, arid areas close to the desert towns of Djibo and Dore.Although greater peace and stability has since returned to northern Mali, deep troubles persist. No fewer than 27 soldiers have been killed by mortars, rockets and land mines in the area since January, including three French troops. It's tough terrain to navigate, and an ideal hiding ground for militant groups, as well as armed separatists. At least two foreign hostages are being held in the area, and there are fears that recent terrorist attacks in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou, Mali's capital Bamako and Grand Bassam, Cote d'Ivoire, may have been plotted in the Sahel region.Many of the refugees at the Burkina Faso camps are of Tuareg ethnicity. As the 2013 conflict escalated, some initially backed the creation of an independent state named Azawad – a move that was resisted by the Malian government, creating chaos and opening up northern Mali to militant groups. For the Tuareg refugees, identity issues are at stake. Their ties to northern Mali go back centuries, to a time when tomes about philosophy, astronomy, poetry, medicine and mathematics were first being arranged on the shelves of Timbuktu's storied libraries. Many of those books were destroyed during the conflict, although some were saved. Now trust between the ethnic Tuaregs and other groups has been eroded. Northern Mali's social fabric has been deeply damaged, and many say they have no choice but to remain in Burkina Faso for their own safety and security.Refugees are housed in two refugee camps in Burkina Faso: Mentao camp, near the town of Djibo, and Goudoubou camp, near the town of Dore. Mentao, the larger camp, has a population of 13,329, according to UNHCR. Gogo Hukportie is UNHCR's resident representative in Burkina Faso. She spoke with Refugees Deeply about the situation.Refugees Deeply: Can you tell us about the greatest challenges that Malian refugees to Burkina Faso currently face?Of course there are additional challenges, linked to the security situation here. Not long ago, there was a terrorist attack in Ouagadougou, and many refugees have been stigmatized because of what happened. There were some attempts to attack refugees, but luckily the government asked the population to calm down and not retaliate after the terrorist attack. UNHCR also reached out to traditional leaders via radio to let people know that the refugees did not have anything to do with the terrorist attack. It did work to some degree, but there is still some fear, especially in the Sahel portion of the country.In 2014 we expected refugees to go back to Mali, but after security incidents, many did not want to return. So we started thinking about what we could offer them, how we could revise our vision. Our initial vision was based on repatriation. We now need to help them to become self-sufficient. As part of income-generating activities, we work with them and their cattle, which can be used as capital. It’s very important that cattle are healthy, so we provide health assistance, grazing land and milk-production facilities. That milk then goes to the refugees’ children twice a week, and the rest of it is pasteurized in local dairies. We trained some of the refugees and the local population in how to develop the dairies. This program is working very well, and there’s a lot of interest in it because it involves the refugees' own cattle.After this interview was conducted, the United States announced $29 million in humanitarian assistance to Mali, including to refugee programs in the region.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.
