Writer at Mama Be Good",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/telling-my-child-about-autism_us_5b9d6b66e4b03a1dcc87cc48,I've been thinking a lot about how and when to tell my child about autism. I didn't want to make autism sound like a disease. I didn't want to project any fears or prejudices on him. I didn't want him to feel anxious about it. I didn't want to make him feel less than. I thought I would mess it up.  I was scared.,2013-09-19,2013-08-06-20130806LincolnMemorial2Fall2012edit.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-06-20130806LincolnMemorial2Fall2012edit.jpg,"I've been thinking a lot about how and when to tell my child about autism. Last month I wrote that I didn't want to tell my child yet. I didn't want to make autism sound like a disease. I didn't want to project any fears or prejudices on him. I didn't want him to feel anxious about it. I didn't want to make him feel less than. I thought I would mess it up. I was scared.An autism educator told me recently that she could think of only two reasons a parent wouldn't tell their child about autism: that they were ashamed of their child or that they thought the child was incompetent.You know what's unhelpful? Assumptions like that. If you can't imagine a parent's love for their child so great that they would rather absorb all the hurt in the world than have their child hurt, you probably shouldn't be talking to parents at all. Every time I've read about a parent telling a child about autism it has been The Big Talk. The parent sits the child down and tells them that their strengths and struggles are because of autism. Sometimes they read a book together about autism, then reveal the diagnosis to the child. It sounded Dramatic and possibly Tragic. If I sat my child down for A Talk, he'd think something was wrong.So I started talking to my autistic friends. Lettuce told me that it should NOT be A Big Talk. Ibby agreed, saying that if it's big, it feels bad. The information should be in trickles, a little bit of at a time. And, Ibby added, make sure to throw in positive references like, ""There's not enough train movies because there's not enough Autistics to think of it."" Nick pointed out that we should avoid framing autism as a disease (""You have autism""), and instead use ""You're autistic"" in our descriptions. Nick also emphasized that in a family with more than one child, it's important to tell the child first before the siblings. Ibby suggested that we ask our children if they want to talk to other autistic people, either in person, online, or by typing.And then it made perfect sense. I've already handled important issues with Jack without ever having A Big Talk. When Jack had seizures, I told him, eh, some people have them. I described what his looked like. I told him what usually brings them on. And when we have to go to the hospital, I make it a big adventure to see the ambulances. And he's fine. No Big Deal.When some of our friends got married recently under newly-passed marriage equality laws, I said, ""Oh, look, Jack! Our friends Xander and Ezekiel just got married."" Jack said, ""Two husbands?"" I said, ""yep"" and life went on. It's a little new information that doesn't change anything about our two friends. No Big Deal.When Jack says, ""Tell me the story of when you got me"" -- I absolutely LOVE how he phrases that -- I tell him that it took me a long time to get pregnant. I waited, it didn't happen, and I needed help from the doctor. I don't tell him the details -- he doesn't need to know all that -- but he knows that I had to have shots and medication. No Big Deal.And finally, I got it. I got it! It's the same thing! A little new information, but No Big Deal. And then I got absolutely excited about telling him. Especially since I could finally say, ""You know how you think model trains should be sold everywhere and for a lot less money? Well... if there were more Autistic people around, they would be.""So we've had some little conversations like this the past few days. My child is listening. No Big Deal."

And while couscous was traditionally paired with stews, functioning similarly to rice, with international popularity came new uses for this semolina dish. With a subdued flavor, couscous makes a perfect complement to a wide variety of flavors, sauces, vegetables and more. From breakfast, to lunch, to dinner, we've rounded up 20 couscous dishes that prove it is a seriously underrated food. Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

3,WELLNESS,2 Curious Causes Of Sleep Eating,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sleep-eating-at-night_us_5b9d8612e4b03a1dcc891a0e,In the second form there is conscious but uncontrollable eating after bedtime. This is referred to as Nocturnal Eating Syndrome,2013-09-19,Woman in Pajamas Sits on Kitchen Floor Next to a Fridge Eating a Cake,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d86122100003300c58f00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," By Robert Rosenberg, DOI find it fascinating that while asleep and in a prolonged fasting state, our blood sugar does not drop. A similar period of fasting, while awake, would result in drops in blood sugar and increases in appetite. However, why is it that when we sleep this does not occur?More From Everyday Health:  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Instead of Drugs for Insomnia Obesity and Sleep Learning While AsleepThe answer is due in part to a decrease in muscle movement and brain activity, especially during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, thus consuming less glucose. There is also an increased production of growth hormone in the beginning of the night and cortisol at the end -- both of which promote the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. Finally, there is an associated increased production of leptin, an appetite suppressing hormone during sleep. Together they work to prevent hypoglycemia and hunger while we sleep.So what is going on with people who consume large amounts of their calories after bedtime? There are two forms of this condition. One is called Sleep-Related Eating Disorder and is a type of sleepwalking. It has been seen along with several medications such as Ambien (zolpidem), as well as in sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. In this condition, there is usually total amnesia for the trips to the kitchen and eating. In fact, many of these people wake up with food in their bed, or stove burners left on and no recollection of what happened in the morning.In the second form there is conscious but uncontrollable eating after bedtime. This is referred to as Nocturnal Eating Syndrome.  It is not unusual for these people to consume over 50 percent of their daily caloric intake after bedtime. Both disorders are characterized by the high intake of simple sugars and fats, thus promoting obesity in many who exhibit these abnormalities.The good news is that they are both treatable. In the case of Sleep-Related Eating Disorder, discontinuing the offending medication, or treating the primary sleep disorder can be curative. In the case of Nocturnal Eating Syndrome, cognitive behavioral therapy, properly timed light therapy and in some cases antidepressants that raise serotonin levels such as sertraline (Zoloft) have been effective. Therefore, if you or a loved one is a night eater, consciously or not, there are treatments available. Talk to your health care provider and if they are not familiar with this ask for a referral to someone who is.""The Night Eaters"" originally appeared on Everyday Health"

While she preps for December's Victoria's Secret fashion show, Ellingson is not feeding herself cotton balls -- but fatty nut butters instead. Lindsay filled Fashionista in:""I like to add curves, I think it's sexier and more feminine to be more full. So I add like almond butter, peanut butter, protein shakes to my diet, just to feel a little sexier and curvier.""OK, so she's hardly chowing down on cake. But Ellingson's diet seems far more relatable -- and more palatable -- than subsisting on egg powder. And while Lindsay exercises often, ""I try not to stress about it because that's never good,"" she says.Amen, Angel.The final product:Want more?
