One of my neighbors asked me about turkey stuffing the other day. Should she stuff her bird or not? Talk about a loaded question! Stuffing and where you cook it is one of the most potentially contentious topics within family Thanksgiving traditions.Millions grew up like I did, with stuffing inside the bird. According to the current recommendations of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), a division of the United States Department of Agriculture, my family would be potential candidates for food poisoning today given the way my mother used to prepare Thanksgiving. She tested turkey doneness by wiggling the drumstick to see how loose it was. But test the stuffing? Ridiculous, she'd have said. And how could she? Digital thermometers hadn't been invented yet. The concept that the stuffing might not be cooked through was not on the radar then. And no one ever got sick.But that was a different time. Old pathogens have gotten stronger and new ones have emerged. I've read enough on the subject to have a healthy respect for these microbes. Cooking your stuffing outside the turkey is the safest and best way to go in 2013. Without the large turkey cavity empty, air circulation in and around the bird improves, allowing it to cook faster and more evenly. All those juices that used to go into the stuffing? They aren't lost! They collect in the bottom of the cavity, and when poured out of the perfectly cooked bird and into the roasting pan, they make a better gravy.SEE MORE: Roasting the Perfect Thanksgiving TurkeyThe crux of the turkey stuffing problem is this: A whole turkey is at its juiciest best when cooked until the meat, when tested in several places with an instant-read thermometer, has reached 165°F. If the turkey is stuffed, the stuffing will not have reached that all-important safe temperature. Stick your thermometer into the middle of the stuffing and you'll see for yourself.In the recent past many many of us in the food media world recommended removing the partially-cooked stuffing from the perfectly-cooked bird and continuing to cook the stuffing outside the bird in a baking dish in the oven or microwave. This seemed like the ideal solution, but these days the FSIS doesn't agree. Kathy Bernard, the Technical Information Specialist in the Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education at the FSIS told me that when you remove stuffing that isn't fully cooked from a fully-cooked bird you risk cross-contamination. Accidents do happen. The current recommendation from the FSIS for stuffed turkeys is to cook them until the stuffing is 165°F. no matter how overcooked the rest of the turkey may become.The good news is that stuffing cooked outside the bird has so much more going for it (just look at the photo above and its recipe)! Texture for starters. As long as you douse the stuffing with good stock along with a couple spoonsful of flavorful turkey drippings from the roasting pan, and bake the stuffing covered to start, then uncovered later, you will end up with the delightful contrast of lovely crisp edges of toasted bread covering a jumble of tender moist innards.Truth be told, I never liked the stuffing cooked on the inside, anyway. It's one-dimensional: mushy bread. There's so much other soft stuff on the table--mashed potatoes, sweet potato purée, cranberry sauce, and later pumpkin pie--that I crave some crunch. And one of the best ways to get it is to cook your stuffing outside the turkey. The choices are clear. If you want juicy meat with a combination of crisp and tender stuffing, cook the stuffing outside the bird. If you like overcooked turkey with wet stuffing, cook the stuffing inside the bird.SEE MORE: Mastering Thanksgiving GravyAnd speaking of the instant read thermometer: You get what you pay for. High end ones read the temperature in three seconds. More affordable but still good-quality ones read it in six seconds.As for where to stick the thermometer, the FSIS revised their recommendations a while ago to account for the buxom birds Americans love. No longer is it sufficient to test the innermost part of the thigh. You've got to test the thickest part of the breast, too, as well as the innermost part of the wing joint where it connects to the breast. And because ovens can be temperamental, with hot and cool spots, it's best to rotate the roasting pan every time you baste the bird, and take the temperature on both sides of your turkey.BTW is phone-texting shorthand for ""by the way."" This Thanksgiving, make BTW your shorthand reminder to test the temperature of the turkey breast, thigh, and wing!See more from Epicurious:  Quick and Easy Dinners  Taste Test: 3 Addictive Peanut Butters   The Secret to Stress-Free Weight Loss  Back-to-School Lunch Ideas for Kids"
1,PARENTING,Sheryl Sandberg: We Need To Talk More About Pregnancy At Work,Lisa Belkin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandbery-pregnancy-at-work_us_5b9dadeee4b03a1dcc8b5a8f,"""Raise your hand if you've called someone in your office and said, 'You may want to have kids one day. I'd love to talk to",2013-11-25,"Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, discusses the challenges facing women in the workplace at a luncheon appearance before the California Women's Legislative Caucus in Sacramento, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2013. Sandberg said after years in corporate America, she wanted to launch a conversation about women's inequality.(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dadee240000510053af93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here's a hypothetical.Your boss calls you in and says, ""I just wanted you to know that if you are thinking about having children one day, and are wondering how pregnancy and motherhood can be combined with your career, my door is always open and I’m glad to talk."" Has anything like that ever happened at your office? How would you react if it did? It often happens in Sheryl Sandberg’s office -- she is the one regularly offering the open door at Facebook, she says -- and among the many changes she would like to see in the national workplace is that this become the unremarkable norm. ""We know that we lose a lot of our high-earning women... during the childbearing years,"" she told the audience at the Salesforce.com Dreamforce conference in San Francisco last week. ""What do we do about that? Nothing. When do we mention it? Never ever.""Your first reaction -- and likely the first reaction of most managers and HR reps -- is that conversations like this are illegal. Anti-discrimination laws prohibit employers from asking such personal questions, no? Not exactly. True, it isn’t legal to quiz an employee about her family plans, and it is definitely illegal to discriminate against her because she is pregnant. But it's not illegal to talk about pregnancy per se. Sandberg first raised that argument in her best-selling book Lean In, and has been championing it around the country in the months since. What has happened, she argues, is that a well-intentioned, necessary protection on privacy has become one more way that women are sabotaged at work. In the same way that heightened sensitivity about harassment and scandal has led male managers to think twice before mentoring a female employee, lest things be misunderstood (64 percent of men who are VPs and above told the Center for Life Work Policy that they hesitate to meet one-on-one with more junior women), the belief that any talk about pregnancy is forbidden has left women without guidance, answers and support. ""There are very good reasons why people don't talk about this in the office,"" Sandberg said in a telephone interview today. ""For too long women were afraid it would be held against them if they were pregnant or even thinking of having children -- afraid that someone was going to write us off, or start giving the good projects to someone else."" And managers, she says, ""didn't want to be seen as holding this against women."" But the ""unintended consequences of well intentioned actions,"" she says, are that ""we don't help women enough. We don't acknowledge that this is complicated and help them plan for it."" Or, as Joseph M. Yaffe of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom wrote when Sandberg began to raise this issue last spring: “Does the desire to avoid doing the 'wrong' thing deter managers and supervisors from doing the 'right' thing to support their valued colleagues?” Sandberg has been getting specific with her recommendations, offering the audience a script of sorts: You may want to have kids one day. My door is open. Come talk to me anytime.She’s had scores of these kinds of conversations, she says, especially when she is interviewing female candidates and she fears they might turn down the job because they worry it will not be a fit with their family life. But she understands that she is an outlier, and that the message that pregnancy is not an employer's business has been communicated so well in recent decades that it is potentially hurting women. Turning to the Dreamforce audience, she asked: ""Raise your hand if you've called someone in your office and said, 'You may want to have kids one day. I'd love to talk to you about it.'""Pausing to scan the room, she said, ""Yeah, I've never gotten a hand.""Ideally, she says, the conversations she is currently championing will eventually not be necessary, because it will be understood that the workplace will support women trying to mesh work and parenting. But that day is a long way away, in her eyes. ""It would be great if the conversation was not necessary – great goal,"" she says. ""But for now, silence is killing us."" "
