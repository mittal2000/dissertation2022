While it's easy to see diabetes as a burden and at times feel angry, ashamed or frustrated, if we look at it through the spirit of thanks-giving, it's also possible to see something gained. And, I find joy in sharing what I've learned with others. So I asked the two questions below and these responses flew into my inbox. Also know, as diabetes moves out of the spotlight this month, we will all still be here alongside you on this journey -- and you can continue to ride along with anyone below by following their blog and/or Twitter account.Q: What habit have you developed that makes managing your, or your child's, diabetes easier?""When I was first trying to regain control after years of burnout, I knew I would act on numbers I saw. But to see those numbers, I needed to check my blood sugar more often. So I left meters out where I would see them -- bathroom, desk, etc. And every time I saw a meter, I'd check."" Melissa Lee, Sweetly Voiced, Twitter: @sweetlyvoiced""To extend myself the same forgiveness, and understanding, which I would give others who struggle, and fall... in order to get up again."" Lizmari M. Collazo, The Angry Type 2 Diabetic, Twitter: @AngryT2Diabetic""Adding exercise to my daily routine has been the best habit I've developed. It helps me to control my blood glucose, which is important since I don't inject insulin."" Kate Cornell, ""Sweet Success: My life with Type 2 Diabetes,"" Twitter: @SweetenedKate""Whenever my daughter checks her blood sugar, I try to say 'thank you for checking.' That helps control the emotional reaction I might otherwise have to her numbers."" Tamar Sofer-Geri, carbDM""I have become a creature of habit in terms of food. I started eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for breakfast 22 years ago when I was diagnosed and I still do to this day (on about 6 out of 7 days of the week). I know that for me it requires 3.5 units of insulin. Not having to play the guessing game of carbohydrate counts has made managing my diabetes easier."" Brandy Barnes, Diabetes Sisters, Twitter: @diabetessisters""I keep learning how holistic health helps the body stay younger, stronger and more resilient. Also I apply the principles of good food and exercise, and those that help decrease stress, like zen meditation, to keep my body, mind and spirit in optimal shape. When I practice this, not only does my blood sugar show the benefit, but managing diabetes feels like it is good for me too!"" Ann Bartlett, Health Central, Body In Balance Center, Twitter: @annbartlett ""The habit of never comparing myself to others has given me more compassion, strength, and freedom than I could ever have hoped for. Plus it's helped me realize just how little I require to be happy."" Sysy Morales, ""The Girl's Guide To Diabetes,"" Twitter: @GG2Diabetes""When I went through a period during which I wasn't checking my blood sugar often enough, I realized that I often 'forgot' my meter. So I started buying small, colorful clutches that are just large enough to hold a meter, strips, glucose tablets, and my wallet. I pick a new one to use each day, and carry it everywhere I go so that I always have my meter handy."" Kelly Rawlings, editorial director, Diabetes Forecast magazine, Twitter: @KellyRawlings""I have created the habit of testing my blood sugar before eating. It's a simple process to test my sugar, take my insulin and then eat. Humans are creatures of habit, so the more good habits you can create, the more good you can create."" Chris Stocker, ""The Life of a Diabetic""""Diabetes has made me significantly more aware of food choices. While we still indulge in treats it is in a more balanced manner. And the magic in being aware is routine."" Bennet Dunlap, ""Your Diabetes May Vary,"" Twitter: @badshoe ""My motto is 'test, correct, and move on' when it comes to out-of-range blood sugar readings."" Cheryl Alkon, Cheryl Alkon, Author of Balancing Pregnancy With Pre-Existing Diabetes: Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby Twitter: @Lyrehca""When I feel myself becoming frustrated with diabetes, I remind myself of how many other people are in my same position. Reminding myself that I'm not alone in this brings me a great deal of reassurance. I also find a resilient sense of humor, and the ability to laugh -- or at least smirk -- helps me deal with the tough moments."" Kim Vlasnik, Texting My Pancreas, You Can Do This. Twitter: @txtngmypancreas Q. How has diabetes helped shape your personality, character or values?""Diabetes has made me more compassionate, helping me find what my passion in life is: helping others. It has also opened my mind to anything that is different or unfamiliar."" Beatriz Dominguez, Cranky Pancreas, Twitter: @crankypancreas""Like steel is forged in fire, the 'fire' of diabetes made me strong, gave my life focus and purpose. I regard it as a gift."" Wil Dubois, Diabetes Author, Educator, and Advocate, LifeAfterDx, Diabetes Mine, dLife""Diabetes has made me determined to succeed in everything I do. Diabetes is a relentless disease and its success is not measured by one (blood sugar) reading, but rather by consistently working through challenges to achieve success for numerous blood sugar readings each day."" Brett Griswold, Diabetes is Like..., It's Only Diabetes!""Living with diabetes has helped me find great joy in the little moments of every day and gives me a true appreciation of life."" Cynthia Zuber, Diabetes Light, Twitter: @diabeteslight""I am still a fairly impatient person, but diabetes has given me more patience. You need this virtue with a condition that is essentially with you 24/7."" Manny Hernandez, Diabetes Hands Foundation Twitter: @askmanny and @DiabetesHF""Diabetes has shown me that sometimes strength, toughness, and determination can come through vulnerability."" Scott Johnson, Scott's Diabetes, Twitter: @scottkjohnson ""Diabetes has shaped my character by helping me to grow brave. I am less timid and squeamish now."" Marie Smith, Joy Benchmarks, Twitter: @cellobard""I thought my perspective on life was sound until my daughter Arden was diagnosed. Diabetes taught me what real perspective is. I see life's challenges differently now. Chronic illness is the great equalizer."" Scott Benner, Arden's Day. (Scott's book, Life Is Short, Laundry Is Eternal, will be on shelves this April.)""I notice more and listen better and empathize more and take more initiative. I feel lucky in a way that I otherwise wouldn't dream of."" Kelly L. Close, editor-in-chief, diaTribe Twitter: @diaTribenews""Living with diabetes has taught me to embrace challenge. Just because something is challenging or difficult does NOT mean it is a 'bad' thing. Facing the challenges of diabetes has helped me learn about who I am, what I care about, and how I can support other people in the world."" Ginger Vieira, Living in Progress, Ginger Vieira YouTube Twitter: @GingerVieiraAs for myself, diabetes has given my life a sense of purpose and the outlet I long searched for to help others. It has given me a sense of belonging, and even though I might not have wanted the keys to the diabetes clubhouse, I'm all the better for it. ""As for habits, I've created many that make managing my diabetes easier, including: 1) always keeping my glucose meter in the same place, on my kitchen counter, 2) having glucose tablets and SweeTarts in every pocket and bag, 3) monthly reminders on my calendar when to start a new vial of insulin, 4) following a low-carb diet, and 5) accumulating friends who share this journey.""

2,DIVORCE,Blinded by Love Again? Tips to Get Your Legal House in Order,"Ben Berkley- ""The Perpeutal Golfer"", Contributor
Attorney/Author and Golf Enthusiast",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/blinded-by-love-again-tip_us_5b9c86dce4b03a1dcc7f75d8,"Before you are blinded by love a second time and decide to remarry, I highly recommend you perform a legal checkup to make sure everything is in order.",2012-11-26,Young man romantically proposing to girlfriend and offering engagement ring,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c86dc2200005600d94535.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before you are blinded by love a second time and decide to remarry, I highly recommend you perform a legal checkup to make sure everything is in order. If something does not seem right or needs to be changed again, now is the time to do it. Too many divorced individuals do not make changes until it's too late, which may impede plans with spouse #2. With a new marriage pending and a magical life awaiting you, your legal checkup should include a review of the following:CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS If you are a custodial parent receiving child support, you need to consult with an attorney to determine if the amount you receive will be affected by your remarriage. Specifically, ask if your new spouse's income will be considered by the court should your ex seek a reduction of the amount you receive.SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS Many divorced or widowed seniors receive Social Security from their former spouses, and remarriage can affect benefits. If you are a widow(er) or divorced and you remarry before age 60, you will not be able to receive Social Security retirement benefits based on your deceased or divorced spouse's work record. You will still receive benefits, however, as long as you remarry after age 60. You may also be able to collect spousal benefits from a new spouse if those benefits are higher.ALIMONY If you are receiving alimony from a divorced spouse, it will end once you remarry. And depending on the laws in your state and divorce settlement, alimony may end even if you simply live with someone else! These states include Alabama, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. RELOCATION AFTER DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE You are about to get remarried. But what if your fiancé's job is transferring him or her out of state and your divorce agreement says you cannot relocate? Without consent from your former spouse, most court orders would hold you in contempt of court if you were to relocate. Your ex may seek a restraining order preventing you from leaving. However, a court may modify the agreement if it is in best interest of your children and does not interfere with financial opportunities. But before you say ""I do"" again -- especially when you are offered a new opportunity and face potential relocation -- seek the advice of an attorney.GUARDIANSHIPS If you have children, your will most likely included a guardianship clause in which you named a primary as well as an alternate person to care for and raise your child if you and your spouse passed away. But now that you are divorced, you may wish to revisit this document to update it. For example, during your former marriage, you may have named in-laws to raise your children if you and your spouse were someday not here. However, your feelings for in-laws may changed when you remarry. Unless you physically change your will before you say I do again, what is stated in that document will be enforceable as your last wishes and will remain in place when you remarry. Visit your attorney before you say those words again!  DEATH OF CUSTODIAL PARENT It is a common misnomer that upon the death of a parent who has custody, the ex-spouse automatically gets custody of the child or children. Though in most cases this would be correct, if you have strong feelings about who should raise your children upon your passing, and you state your wishes in your will, most courts will be willing to consider your appointment for another guardian before placing custody with your ex.LIVING TRUSTS If you and your spouse made a trust, the assets that were originally placed in it were most likely redistributed to each of you as your separate property. But when you are contemplating remarriage, you should consider making a new trust in your name alone and transfer those assets into your trust so that they remain your separate property. And by doing so, the trust would also contain language that sets out your wishes for how your assets are to be distributed upon your passing.DIVORCE DOCUMENTS What if you don't really know if your divorce is final? Note that the County Clerk accepts what you have stated on your marriage appliction as the truth, as you are signing it ""under penality of perjury."" Clerks do not have resources to research if information you have provided is correct. Before you say I do again, make sure you are divorced. Otherwise, if you find out that your first marriage was not terminated by the court, your second marriage will not be valid, and that invites a whole set of new problems.""NUNC PRO TUNC"" And finally, make sure your ex completed the paperwork for your divorce and did not drop the ball! Fortunately, the courts have a solution to this common problem. Apply to the court for a Nunc Pro Tunc -- Latin for ""please back date my divorce so I can get married."" Remarriage can be magical. The second time around offers a real chance at love and to reinvent yourself. In my 34 years of experience however, I have seen too many unhappy legal situations that stymied new relationships and could have been avoided if only divorced spouses had completed some simple steps to ensure a hassle-free, loving, prosperous and rewarding future. Benjamin Berkley, Esq., author of ""Before You Say I Do Again: A Buyer's Beware Guide to Remarriage"" (2009) has first hand experience of client remarriage and its pitfalls, successes and failures.

""Whether this happens at 8 (12.8 kilometers) or 10 or 12 miles down the road, it will happen,"" he said.A veteran of 60 marathons, Holland was set to run his ninth New York City Marathon earlier this month, until the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race was canceled in the wake of Superstorm Sandy.""Over 100,000 people apply to the New York City Marathon each year,"" he said. ""There must be something there that people want.""Gregory Chertok, a sports psychologist with the American College of Sports Medicine, said many people are drawn to running because it's an uncomplicated activity.""Put one foot in front of the other and when you work hard, you improve,"" Chertok said. ""Not everything in life is so simple. You could spend 10 years in a ballet studio and not become a ballerina.""Few runners enter a marathon to win it, he said.""It's so rare in sporting culture for those who aren't physically or aerobically gifted to feel included in something that's competitive but not exclusive.""While it's tough to categorize athletes, Chertok said, long-distance running seems to be appreciated by those who enjoy solitude - or periods of solitude - and are OK with monotony.Chertok differentiates external from internal motivation and said studies show that people who set goals based on intrinsic motivation are more successful.""People run with the initial goal of losing weight or getting fit, which are external goals, but during training they realize they love running, so they end up running for internal reasons,"" he said.Qualitative evidence for the runner's high suggests that for those prone to its euphoria, it probably contributes to running's addictive quality.""Those that have it swear by it,"" he said.Most sports medicine practitioners would agree that people are born to be mobile, he said, but not necessarily to run long distances.""Physicians will deter people from running marathon distances, but it's such a powerful allure that it becomes greater than risk of hamstring injury,"" he said.Richard Finn, spokesman for New York Road Runners, organizers of the New York City Marathon, agrees that long distances do not suit everyone.""Running 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers) is a big, bold brash undertaking,"" he said. ""You've got to put heart, soul, mind, body in it for months. It's like climbing Mount Everest. Not everybody should be doing it.""He said a runner is a runner whether you're doing a marathon or a five0kilometer (3.1-mile) race.""We do running 365 days a year, since 1959,"" Finn said of the New York Road Runners. ""Get those sneakers on and run, even on a treadmill. We're not elitist. We think running is good for you.""Holland believes running also exposes our weakest link so he urges novices to start slow.""Running is an amazing cheap thing that can make us feel great about ourselves,"" he said.

Like most things in life, there are pros and cons to traveling as well.",2012-11-26,"In this Oct. 12, 2012 file photo, people walk in front of flags of European countries outside the European Parliament in Brussels. If European Union leaders are looking to save some serious money, they might look no further than the ""traveling circus"" that is the European Parliament. The EU assembly leads a pricey and nomadic life. Once a month, it shifts thousands of lawmakers, their staffs, translators and interpreters, to Strasbourg, France, 400 kilometers (250 miles) away, for a four-day meeting. And then it trucks them all back to Brussels again. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8cbd1f00005000214398.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You've raided your couch cushions, slashed your weekly pizza deliveries in half and scrounged together enough cha-ching to make your travel fantasies a reality. Whether you saved enough for a few weeks basking under the Caribbean's scorching rays or for six months train hopping around Europe, your bags are packed, your flight is booked and your passport pages are awaiting fresh stamps.After hearing countless life-changing stories and career revelations from those who've already ventured abroad, you knew you had to test it out for yourself.Everyone told you that fleeing the safety of your own borders would be eye opening, life altering and maybe even revolutionary. Travel would either confirm or squash your preconceived notions; it would either make you more tolerant or less; it would reveal your strengths or expose your weaknesses. But without a doubt, travel would somehow change you and your life.And, now that you're back on our own soil, you fully grasp the extent to which your adventures impacted you. Traveling abroad did change you. But all those overzealous travel junkies who raved about the benefits of going abroad, forgot to mention one small tidbit: the return home. While it's logical to plan for a trip, travelers often become so entranced in the moment that they don't always anticipate the after-effects of travel. Like most things in life, there are pros and cons to traveling as well.You've got mail...and lots of it  Traveling abroad is designed to help you unplug from the technology overwhelm that binds many of us to our computers, cell phones and tablets nearly 24/7. And, it often does. Since not every country has lightening fast Wi-Fi, it can be a welcome relief to disconnect for a while. So enjoy it... It doesn't last long.Once you're home, you not only need to catch up on your work inbox (which is now over capacity), but you must also reply to all of the emails you've now accumulated from new acquaintances you've made abroad. Now, with friends scattered throughout the world, you're busy responding to emails, messaging friends on Facebook and making long-distance phone calls at 2 a.m. Your online social life might be thriving... But it might be costing you some snooze time and some actual face-to-face social interaction. Unfortunately, don't expect to see an empty inbox anytime soon.Plan to arrive home starving Have you started to crave Mexican enchiladas, Italian pizza or Swiss chocolate since returning home? By the time you're safely back on your own soil, you won't only be salivating for those mouthwatering bites, but you'll also be starving for more travel experiences.While every traveler hits bumps in the road, most experience a high like nothing else. Travel adds a bit of spice to life and keeps you going back for seconds, thirds and fourths. Once you get a taste of what is available in the world, your appetite for travel may never diminish. You are richer, but not wealthier  The instant friendships, the breathtaking sights, the slower pace of life and the unforgettable experiences add richness to your life that far outweighs any material possessions. Travel fulfills a gap in a way that money simply can't. Unfortunately, travel can also empty your bank account.Although traveling to far-off lands is an invaluable educational experience in itself, you'll need to be prepared for the sticker shock of it all. Even those who scrap for food, haggle with street vendors and sleep in dirt-cheap hostels will probably come home with less money than what they left with. Unless you're already rolling in dough, your retirement and savings accounts might be put on the back burner for a while. You receive a (false) sense of comfort Staring out your bedroom window with a coffee cup in hand and the rolling hills of Tuscany staring back at you is quite a sight. You may answer a few emails in the morning and then delve into a page-turning novel in the afternoon. Life, overall, is not just comfortable, but free from stress.While traveling abroad gives you respite from your day-to-day obligations, it also gives you a false sense of comfort. It makes you forget your high-strung bosses, clogged inboxes and ungrateful customers. The transition from traveler back to overworked office minion isn't any easy one to grasp. Once you are exposed to a more laid-back lifestyle, you might find it difficult to return to your ""normal"" routine.Travel leads you astray One of the best aspects of traveling abroad is the ability to explore places far different from what you are accustomed to. Sometimes these explorations are intentional and sometimes they occur by mistake. Occasionally you hop on the wrong bus or train, and occasionally you throw your plans to the curb and let the wind guide you. Travel doesn't always take you to where you plan to go, but it does take you to where you need to go. It often opens your eyes to a world of possibilities. It exposes your true passions and gifts. When you're abroad, you may be lead off your original path, but toward a more fulfilling one. This is true once you return home as well. Unfortunately, that path isn't always paved. It's up to you to find your way and this can sometimes be more difficult than you might imagine. Although most people do their research prior to boarding the plane, very rarely do people prepare for the changes that occur once they return home. So be warned. Travel will change you, it will change your outlook and it might change your entire future. But, I guess adding some new friends to your social circle, discovering a thirst for travel and pursuing new passions aren't always bad. Maybe these ""pitfalls"" are really just rewards in disguise."
