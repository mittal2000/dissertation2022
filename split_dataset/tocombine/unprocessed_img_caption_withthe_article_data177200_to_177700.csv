Fragrances and perfumes have often contributed to mild allergies, like sneezing or watery eyes, but the chemical scents may also bring on bouts of contact dermatitis (a condition in which the skin becomes red, sore, or inflamed after direct contact with a substance) or, in the worst cases, depression.""Scent sells. So not only are there definitely more fragranced products in the world, the fragrances themselves are also more complex. And for many people, repeated exposures can bring about a constellation of symptoms,"" Tracie DeFreitas Saab, a human factors consultant with the Job Accommodation Network at West Virginia University, told WebMD.About one in 10 people are estimated to have ongoing allergic reactions to chemical elements in fragrances, but with the increased use of scents -- whether it's an air freshener or scented candle -- allergies are on the rise with 55 percent of Americans testing positive for at least one allergen.Aside from general irritation, contact dermatitis, which presents as inflamed skin, may also result from an allergy or irritant brought on by perfume. In more severe cases, cosmetic contact dermatitis can trigger eczema, a chronic skin disorder marked by itchy rashes.But the heaviest health burden falls on the 2 percent of the population who are chemically intolerant. This heightened chemical sensitivity can be incapacitating in the most extreme cases, rendering sufferers unable to leave the house because they are so bothered by certain synthetic molecules in scents. Chemically intolerant people are also more likely to experience panic attacks or develop major depressive disorder, according to a recent study conducted at two Texas family medicine practices. ""We don't know why this association exists,"" lead researcher Dr. David A. Katerndahl of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio told Reuters. While Katerndahl found chemical intolerance is linked to mental health problems, the study does not prove cause and effect.Though the vast majority of the population is not effected by such severe side effects, people who wear perfume should still be cautious of the chemicals in the bottle. In a 2010 report from the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics in partnership with the Environmental Working Group, researchers found 14 potentially harmful chemicals that were not listed on fragrance product labels.""'The fragrance mixture itself can be comprised of dozens, even hundreds, of individual chemicals, and those don't have to be listed on the label,"" Jane Houlihan, co-author of the report and EWG senior vice president for research, told WebMD."

But their royal tour of Asia and the Pacific was a time full of rainforest exploring, ceremonial dancing and canoe rides dogged by stress, as more and more tabloids published the topless photos and a legal battle raged on back in the UK. Will and Kate's nine-day trip came to an end on Wednesday, as the couple wrapped up their trek through Singapore, Malaysia, Borneo and the Solomon Islands and flew from Tuvalu, where the famous grass skirt dancing happened, to Brisbane, Australia, in order to catch a flight back to England. (Catherine changed outfits in between, switching out her lovely floral frock for a more plane-ready pair of jeans, a scarf and a comfy sweater.)While alighting from the royal's private jet, however, a gust of wind sent Kate's hemline flying on the tarmac.

2,DIVORCE,Divorce Coach: 3 Things A Divorce Coach Can Do For You,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-money-what-can-a-div_us_5b9c501ae4b03a1dcc7db98b,Pittenger used her divorce coach to take lawyers almost completely out of the equation. She worked with an attorney-turned,2012-09-19,mid-adult businessman in a conversation with the consultant or psychologist,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c501a24000050005325f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Geoff WilliamsSept 19 (Reuters) - Getting unmarried is as time-consuming and detail-oriented as tying the knot in the first place, so if you were the type to hire a wedding planner, it's not a far leap to think you'd want a divorce coach.""The whole process is an emotional roller coaster,"" says Candace Pittenger, 51, a natural healer in Carlsbad, California, who used a divorce coach this year to help end her 13-year marriage.""You're splitting up everything - your house, your stuff, our children, which in our case are our furry pets. I knew a lot of emotions would come up, and I needed someone to help me deal with all of those.""Just as the 1990s brought the rise of life coaches, the new millennium is the age of the divorce coach. It's a concept that appears to have started with Dr. Kim Lurie, a Merrick, New York, attorney who began calling herself a divorce coach in the 1990s. The phrase ""divorce coach"" doesn't begin turning up in newspaper archives until the 2000s, when attorneys, financial mediators, psychotherapists and other professionals began reinventing themselves and calling themselves divorce coaches.In recent years, businesses around the country have taken divorce coaching to a new level: A couple works with several coaches, each specializing in things such as finances and co-parenting.The key to finding a competent divorce coach is researching your coach's background - whether it's law, finance or counseling - and deciding if it will lend itself to helping you navigate your divorce. Some divorce coaches do receive specialized training, but if you aren't careful, you could wind up hiring a divorce coach whose only experience is having been divorced. The industry is in its infancy even as its (mostly) affluent clients struggle with very grown-up problems.So if you're thinking of hiring a divorce coach, here is what they can help you with. 1. Pre-legal adviceMany people use divorce coaches to minimize talking to their lawyers. It's a chance to vent about what a jerk your ex is to a professional who isn't going to bill you as much.Pittenger used her divorce coach to take lawyers almost completely out of the equation. She worked with an attorney-turned-divorce coach, Laura McGee, who referred her to Sarah Elder, who runs Divorce with Dignity, a service that specializes in legal documents needed for divorce.Mostly, though, divorce coaches are used in conjunction with attorneys.""I love them, and if I had my way, I'd never work without them,"" says Brigitte Bell, a Chicago divorce attorney. ""They help manage the clients and support them by bringing a different set of skills to the divorce process than we do.""Randall Cooper, co-founder of CDC College for Divorce Coaching in Tampa, Florida, which provides training and certification to divorce coaches, says the average cost of a divorce coach is $100 to $150 per hour, versus several hundred per hour for an attorney. The cost of either often depends on geography.McGee, of San Diego, charges $225 for a 90-minute coaching session and $375 for a 2.5-hour session. Someone with a really complicated divorce may want to spend $675 for her five-hour session.Just don't mistake a divorce coach's advice for legal advice. ""It's not,"" says Cooper. ""That's the realm of the attorney."" 2. Hand-holdingWhile some people lean on friends and family for support, that can come with its own emotional baggage. Many divorced individuals, says Dave Hilton, a Dallas-based financial conflict coach, have ""family members pushing them extremely hard to take their ex for all they are worth or hurt them in another way.""Cooper says his job is to be his client's ""thinking partner."" Divorce is a long process, and the coach goes along for the ride - not as legal counsel or therapist, but as a guide. ""It's all about creating a safe, supportive, nonjudgmental and patient environment,"" says Cooper.And the objectivity of a paid coach can be useful, says Beth Ashby, 46, a former nurse in West Lafayette, Indiana, who is getting her divorce coach certificate from CDC. ""A divorce coach can really help someone define and refine their goals and let you pare down and peel the onion layers and get to what really matters,"" she says.But be aware that even if coaching costs a lot less than most lawyers, fees can add up if you book a lot of hours. 3. OrganizingYou may have your emotions in order but not your paperwork, so there are free and low-cost services available, such as legal aid societies and software programs like DivorceWriter.com and RocketLawyer.com. But if that's still too difficult, a coach is one level up in help (and cost).Chris Furney, a project manager at a consumer products company in Atlanta, and his wife Anna ended their marriage in 2010 using Divorce Innovations, which specializes in divorce without lawyers. Two coaches helped the couple with everything from navigating their taxes to working out child-support issues, which was very helpful, says Furney, who admits to not initially understanding the nuts and bolts of the process.Furney says he spent about $3,000 on his attorneys and $7,000 at Divorce Innovations, which shows that divorce coach costs can add up. But he estimates he might have spent three times that if he had only gone with lawyers, and would have lost plenty from the financial mistakes he would have made on his own."

The change in seasons brings many good things (scarves, sweaters, less sweating), but not so welcome is the allergy-related assault on our eyes and skin. More specifically: red, watery eyes, puffy face and blotchy, dry skin from excessive nose-blowing. Aka ""allergy face."" Between popping Claritin and Zyrtec, we're here to present you with a two-fold plan of attack: part soothing skincare, part concealing makeup (which is essential since the first part is helping calm things down a bit). Check out our tips below, then keep scrolling down for the best products for getting your face back to normal in no time.   Replenish fluids: You're dehydrated, actually your blood vessels are dehydrated, which is what causes a puffy face. Drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up to get rid of swelling. To further the de-puffing efforts, apply a cold compress over the entire face.Smooth away dryness: Things are a little tricky because while skin is dry and flaky, it's also raw and irritated -- not just any cleanser or scrub will do. You need a hydrating, anti-inflammatory blend that buffs away dry patches, but won't deplete moisture. Look for a cleansing milk that contains healing properties, like flavanoids, which prevent inflammatory histamines from acting up. A gentle scrub that contains oatmeal will exfoliate, while also being emollient, helping skin retain hydration as it softens. Finally, employ a super-comforting cucumber mask, which will bring additional moisture and banish swelling. Reduce red, swollen eyes: Used tea bags that have been chilling in the fridge are actually excellent at bringing down puffiness and fighting dark circles. (We picked up this tip from one of our Beauty Street Style ladies.) Gently massaging the area can help drain excess fluids. Using your finger, very carefully apply pressure around the eye area. Also, look for a soothing eye cream that contains a cool metal massaging tip. Cover up the rest: A hard-working concealer will get you far on mornings like these. To battle redness, look for formulas that contain a slightly greenish cast, which will neutralize redness. A tinted moisturizer or BB cream will even out any blotchiness, while adding extra hydration. Want more? Be sure to check out Stylelist on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Pinterest."

In recent years, it seems that the ""signature amenity,"" a singular gift to clients designed to create an indelible memory, has become a staple of the luxury hotel business.In fact, many of the hotels that offer truly bizarre amenities are on the more expensive end of the spectrum. These amenities run the gamut from the physically to intellectually stimulating, from the playful to the downright eccentric. They showcase not only the breadth of what is on offer for savvy travelers, but the diversity of travelers themselves. Keep in mind that if these amenities are still being offered, someone is providing positive feedback."
