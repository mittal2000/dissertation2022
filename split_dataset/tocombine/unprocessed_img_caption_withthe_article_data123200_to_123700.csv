(AP Photo/Steven Senne)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dfd0d1f00002d0021d38e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Svea Herbst-BaylissBOSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - The homemade bombs that ripped through the crowd at the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring 264, showcased the city's medical talent but also taught valuable lessons in responding to a mass disaster.By all accounts, Boston's hospitals performed well after the attacks on April 15, 2013. While many of the wounded lost limbs and a large amount of blood, all who made it to a hospital survived.Looking back, a year after their hospitals were packed with blast victims, Boston officials have tweaked how they prepare for a disaster, now requiring city emergency medical personnel to carry tourniquets and developing a standard method for one city agency to track disaster victims in hospitals.The new techniques will be in place by this year's race, set for April 21, with 36,000 runners taking part and tens of thousands of spectators expected to line the 26.2 mile course.""This was worth more than 1,000 drills,"" said Dr. Eric Goralnick, medical director of emergency preparedness at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which received more than two dozen bombing victims. ""A real event highlights real shortfalls and real successes like no other. And, after the marathon, every health-care provider became a champion of emergency preparedness.""A variety of factors contributed to the survival rate last year. Hundreds of police and medical personnel were working the race, allowing for a quick response. Hospitals hold disaster scenario drills dozens of times a year, making sure teams are able to work quickly and fluidly in a crisis.The city's compact size made for speedy transport to its six level-one trauma centers, where doctors and nurses stabilized victims, set bones, and performed necessary amputations.A key element, experts said, was the use of tourniquets, sometimes improvised from clothing. They stopped excessive bleeding from wounds to victims' feet and lower legs caused when the nail-filled pressure-cooker bombs exploded at ground level.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. soldiers have often encountered improvised explosive devices, illustrate the value of tourniquets. City officials are applying that knowledge more widely as tourniquets become standard equipment for Emergency Medical Services staff.""Every clerk, cook and trombone player has a tourniquet and if we'd had more that day, patients would have gotten to us in better physiological shape,"" said Joseph Blansfield, trauma program manager at Boston Medical Center who served as a combat nurse in Iraq. ""Some were on their last drops of blood.""KEEPING TRACKThe throngs of patients who arrived with no identification underscored flaws in electronic tracking systems where the victims' strings of identifying numbers started to look alike.On the day of the bombing, the biggest weakness, however was in pushing information to one central agency responsible for tracking all data from all hospitals to help reunite families.The most vivid illustration of that occurred when relatives of Krystle Campbell, who was killed, were initially told she had survived, only to later learn it was her friend who was alive.Staff from Boston's hospitals have since created a new single-page disaster record, including a checklist to capture specific aspects of care that might be missed in a disaster and record identifying features like hair color, tattoos and piercings.""It is important that we ID people better and push that to the next level quickly,"" said Maureen McMahon, director of emergency management at Boston Medical Center. ""It was hard to look people in the eye and say we don't know where your loved one is."" PROSTHETICS PROJECTAs victims slowly adjust to life without limbs, a ballroom dance instructor's story inspired a Massachusetts Institute of Technology biophysicist who is a double amputee to return her to the dance floor with a specially designed bionic leg.""It was 3.5 seconds between the blasts that took Adrianne Haslet-Davis off the dance floor, but within 200 days we brought her back,"" said Hugh Herr, head of the Biomechatronics research group at MIT's Media Lab. Last month, Haslet-Davis performed a 30-second rumba onstage at a conference where Herr was speaking.Cautioning that the dancing leg is still in research and not yet a product, Herr said bionic limbs are far better than conventional prosthetics in returning victims to everyday activities.This month he launched the No Barriers Boston Fund (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/no-barriers-boston-fund/x/6919991) to raise money to pay for Boston Marathon bombing survivors to receive bionic limbs designed for athletic use that are often not covered by regular insurance.

1,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking Off the Cuff: Waiting for Spring With a Triple-Carrot Risotto,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-wait_us_5b9df7f5e4b03a1dcc8fac97,"No, this risotto doesn't taste traditionally Italian -- just delicious.",2014-04-16,"The stock: carrots, a shallot, cumin and fennel - and kombu seaweed for savoriness",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df7f3250000330036a9e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I'm not sure whether the expression ""tripling down"" exists, but that's what I seem to have done with one of the more flavorful vegetables still hanging around in the farmers' market pending the arrival of spring produce: carrots. And I brought them into a risotto in three forms, all of them adding flavor and some adding texture. With certain other vegetable risottos -- notably squash -- I've acquired the habit of finely grating some of the title ingredient and cooking it along with the rice. It falls apart in the liquid, creating a lovely creaminess and, of course, reinforcing the flavor. With this carrot version, though, I've gone one step further: even the stock tastes of little more than carrot (with a little trickery to heighten that flavor). I've also used a non-Italian approach to spicing, bringing in cumin seed because of its particular affinity with carrots, and a little fennel seed to round things out. So, no, this risotto doesn't taste traditionally Italian; just delicious.I made the stock in a pressure cooker: A pound of carrots, peeled and sliced; one shallot (or onion), peeled and not sliced; not much salt; a little cumin seed and even less fennel seed; and a piece of dried kombu seaweed. The shallot and the kombu are there to enhance the carrot flavor; having put it in yourself, you will smell and taste the seaweed, but no one else will. They'll just wonder why this stock tastes so good. I drowned the ingredients in water (a bit less than two quarts/liters) and pressure-cooked for 20 minutes, then let the cooker cool of its own accord and strained the stock through a very fine strainer (or through paper toweling or a coffee filter). The second carrot element is the finely grated carrot: a good sized one, weighing about 6 ounces (170 g) for two portions, though quantities are not all that crucial here. I used a Microplane rasp-grater, but a food processor or the finest side of a box grater would work all right. I sweated a minced shallot (again, onion would be fine), 1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seed, 1/4 teaspoon whole fennel seed and some butter in my favorite risotto-making pan; when the shallot had softened, I added the grated carrots and stirred them over medium-low heat until they began to cook, seasoning with salt and pepper. At some point I also prepared the third tranche of carrots: another carrot of similar size, peeled and cut into scant-1/4-inch (6 mm) dice, then caramelized in butter over medium heat with a sprinkle of salt. They should be almost crunchy, but cooked: they will get only brief additional cooking. When they were done, I patted off excess fat with a paper towel.Likewise, I made some little buttery croutons, over low heat so the bread would get crisp right through. But, you know what? I did this only because there were no nuts in the house: my ideal garnish for this risotto would have been toasted walnuts.Getting back to the risotto pan: I shoved the mass of carrots to the side to make room for a little more butter and a generous 2/3 cup (170 g) of rice -- I used the carnaroli variety, as I almost always do. When the rice had cooked with the butter for a minute, I stirred it together with the grated carrots and added 1/2 cup (120 ml) white wine. That's a bit more than I'd normally use, but the carrots and carrot stock are sweet and the acidity in the wine helps balance the dish.From here I followed standard risotto procedure, stirring pretty much constantly, and gradually adding carrot stock kept hot over a small flame. When the risotto was very nearly done, I stirred in the browned dice of carrot, let it warm through and checked for seasoning. A trifle more acidity was needed, so I stirred in about 1/3 cup (80 ml) tart crème fraîche, which also made for a more luxurious consistency. A squeeze of lemon juice would have been another possibility.I then served it up, garnished with crunchy croutons and not garnished with cheese.It was very carroty -- in an entirely good way -- and the cumin flavor was alluring. The rice, however, still made itself known, and that is the point of a risotto, isn't it? "
