2,POLITICS,GOP Win In Kentucky 'Heartbreaking' For Obamacare Advocates,Jeffrey Young and Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kentucky-obamacare_us_563a3b22e4b0307f2cab7bb0,Huge gains in health coverage are at risk when GOP Gov.-elect Matt Bevin takes office next year.,2015-11-05,"Kentucky is one of 30 states, along with the District of Columbia, that expanded eligibility for Medicaid benefits to more low-income residents under the Affordable Care Act.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563a3cd62900002f004dc25e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Kentucky attracted the national spotlight over the past two years as the state slashed its uninsured rate and implemented Obamacare more smoothly than President Barack Obama himself. Progressive activists and health care advocates fear that's all in jeopardy after Tuesday's victory by conservative Republican Matt Bevin in the race to be the next governor.Bevin has vowed to roll back Kentucky's participation in the Affordable Care Act by dismantling the state's health insurance exchange, Kynect, and curtailing the expansion of Medicaid that has given health coverage to about 400,000 poor Kentuckians since 2013.""It's heartbreaking. It really is,"" said Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy organization in Louisville. ""We see a lot of positive things happening in Kentucky, and we're really concerned that we're going to lose some of that access to care that's been so critical, and that all the work that we've done and the national model that Kentucky has become is going to be lost.""Still, Bevin has made notable steps toward moderating his position on Obamacare in Kentucky during the latter stages of the campaign. And whatever he attempts when he takes office next year, Bevin may well have to hope a Republican occupies the White House in 2017 for his more ambitious plans to become reality.Bevin will seek those changes against a backdrop of major progress in Kentucky the past two years. Since enrollment in private coverage from health insurance exchanges like Kynect and in expanded Medicaid took effect at the beginning of 2014, Kentucky has slashed its uninsured rate by more than 11 percentage points to 9 percent, a decline second only to Arkansas' more than 13 percentage points, Gallup reported. About half a million Kentuckians have enrolled since then, and the 400,000 new Medicaid enrollees make up most of them.Bevin's election jeopardizes those advances and marks the first time since Obamacare sign-ups started that a new governor will ascend on a platform that includes undoing elements of the program already in place. Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson had such an opportunity this year, but declined to support doing away with the privatized Medicaid expansion created by his Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe, despite conservatives clamoring for its repeal. Four states either abandoned plans for handling their own enrollments or halted those activities amid technical or financial troubles, but Kynect would be the first successful state-run exchange to shut down.During his campaign against Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway, Bevin promised to reverse the course set by term-limited Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat who established Kynect and expanded Medicaid under state laws that allowed him to circumvent the state legislature, which is divided between Republicans and Democrats.""There are ways to make this program probably more efficient and still have the same result,"" said House Speaker Greg Stumbo (D), a state legislator from eastern Kentucky. ""I'm willing to work with Gov. Bevin any way I can to try to accomplish that. I'm not willing to throw those people off the Medicaid rolls.""Bevin announced plans to scrap Kynect and transition current enrollees to the federal health insurance exchange accessible from HealthCare.gov for the benefits they would use in 2017; enrollment for 2016 plans began Sunday. Bevin also vowed to take on Medicaid, which currently covers almost 1.2 million Kentuckians, or about a quarter of the state's residents. The governor-elect has said the state can't afford to pay its share of the expenses for the exchange and the Medicaid expansion, the latter of which is nearly fully federally funded. But as the campaign progressed, Bevin backed away from earlier calls to completely eliminate the Medicaid expansion, saying instead he would seek federal permission to overhaul the program, a position he repeated in an interview with NBC News Tuesday. Bevin referred to the deal Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence struck with the Obama administration to expand Medicaid but add new requirements for beneficiaries, such as making them pay a higher share of their medical costs than people in other states. ""Nobody's losing anything,"" he told NBC News. If Bevin's ambitions are limited to remodeling Medicaid as states like Indiana, Arkansas and Michigan have done, he may win approval from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to move ahead. ""If he’s envisioning a negotiation along the lines of what has been successful in other states, I'm confident that officials at CMS could engage in that kind of discussion with him,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday. ""It certainly beats the alternative that he colorfully described as 'bouncing people off Medicaid.'""Stumbo expressed skepticism that the Medicaid reforms in Indiana and other states actually improve the program. ""If there's a better way to build a mousetrap and it still catches the mouse, I'm totally receptive to listen to those ideas. If we're going to build a mousetrap that can't catch a mouse and tell people that it can, I'm not going to be a part of that,"" he said.And if Bevin seeks bigger changes than those obtained by Indiana and other states, like halting new enrollments, CMS would almost certainly turn him down -- at least as long as Obama or some other Democrat is in the White House. “The administration will never agree to capping enrollment,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a law professor at George Washington University and a Medicaid expert. “It’s out of the question -- a non-starter.”Having won conservative plaudits for his uncompromising opposition to Obamacare, Bevin could feel pressure to act swiftly in rolling back the health care law. But the newly elected governor may also get a grace period to make the reforms he promised. David Adams, a Kentucky political operative who managed Rand Paul's successful Senate bid in 2010, said the real big steps in modifying Medicaid expansion would come if a Republican wins the White House this November.""Anything that we can do to stem the tide is worth trying until we can effect a full repeal,"" said Adams, who is based near Lexington in Nicholasville. ""We need to be going the opposite direction on Medicaid as fast as we can, and it may be that the fastest we can, we have to circle in red the date of Jan. 20, 2017, and hope that a new president is inclined to give us permission.""For now, Bevin's health care proposals are at odds with the views of Kentucky residents, despite his victory Tuesday, especially when it comes to expanded Medicaid, surveys have shown. According to a Bluegrass Poll reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader, a majority of Kentuckians want the expansion maintained, compared with less than one-quarter who favor repeal. In spite of Bevin's large margin of victory Tuesday, that may provide an opening for activists who want to fight against eliminating Kynect or scaling back the Medicaid expansion, even though Bevin may be able to act unilaterally to undo these policies just as Beshear did to create them.The legislature is limited in how much it can steer Bevin's plans for Kynect and Medicaid, especially if the Republican Senate and Democratic House aren't in sync, Stumbo said. Organized opposition to Bevin's policies from Kentuckians could make the difference, he said.""Anything that's done by the governor that adversely affects that program is going to have some sort of impact on 1.2 million Kentuckians,"" Stumbo said. But Tuesday's election results leave doubt as to whether support for a fight against Bevin on health care will materialize, he said.""It doesn't appear from what happened at the ballot box that a lot of those people showed up to vote,"" Stumbo said. ""Will they be man enough to show up to vote if somebody tampers with or takes away their insurance coverage?""Also on HuffPost:"

The Democratic senator from Massachusetts said she thinks seniors got a raw deal when the Social Security Administration announced last month that, because prices haven't risen in the past year, Social Security benefits wouldn't be going up, either. ""Social Security benefits are supposed to be indexed to inflation so that benefits rise when prices go up,"" says a press release announcing Warren's Seniors and Veterans Emergency Benefits Act. ""But Congress’s formula is volatile and does a poor job of reflecting what older Americans actually spend.""Arguing that the government's measurement of inflation is wrong, Warren's office said her bill would give seniors and veterans a one-time lump sum of about $580, or roughly 3.9 percent of their annual benefits. The percentage represents the average increase in compensation for CEOs last year, the release says.The cost of the bill would be offset by ending a tax ""loophole"" that allows businesses to write off performance-based executive compensation. Republicans control Congress and are unlikely to support the legislation. Warren and other Democrats have proposed changing the way the government measures inflation for Social Security and other programs. Falling gasoline prices held down the government's current measure of inflation, but would have had less of an effect on an alternate measure that Democrats say better reflects seniors' spending habits. Still, going by that measure would have only yielded a 0.6 percent boost in benefits next year. Arthur Delaney is a co-host of the ""So That Happened"" politics podcast:"

That is, until now.The Tony-nominated actress bares all in a new video by StyleLikeU, revealing how racism, ageism, sexism and the people around her have shaped the badass woman she is today. For every item of clothing shed, Rubin-Vega reveals something intimate about herself, like how early on in her career she had had her breast and nose surgically augmented because “if you're not fuckable looking, then you're either the gnome under the bridge, or somebody’s grandmother, or an extra,” she says in the video. She also discusses the entertainment industry’s pervasive and ever-present diversity problem.“The better jobs on television for someone that looks like me… is 'Devious Maids'. My girlfriends are all on 'Devious Maids'. Boy it’s a lot of fun… you’re a maid,” Rubin-Vega explains with a sigh. “People like me are supposed to clean toilets and shit, and take care of your kids.”Through it all, Rubin-Vega says her stepfather’s words of advice kept her going. “He’d say you have to be smarter, because people are going to think you’re stupid just by the way you look. It’s not an even playing field, and because of your race, and because of your class, people are gonna judge you. So you have to be smarter than other people,” Rubin-Vega recalls. “So I took that and I rode with it.” Now in her 40s, Rubin-Vega says she’s a lot more fearless than she was in her youth. “Now I’m more unapologetic in the sense of going after what I want -- asking for what I want,” Rubin-Vega explains. Especially when it comes to her career.“I’m in the Labyrinth Theater Company. We started that company because people like us weren’t doing Chekov or Shakespeare, or Tennessee Williams or American Classics -- or any kinds of classics because of the color of our skin and they way we spoke. We don’t do shit like that; we play ‘the other people,’” explains Rubin-Vega. “It’s still a struggle, but at least I can say I helped make it happen. It pisses you off to make a change, you know, and say ‘I have nothing to lose if I do this.’”Watch the video above for more truth bombs from Rubin-Vega. Also on HuffPost: "

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) unexpectedly found himself on the defensive about information he had released about Hillary Clinton's private email server.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) accused Johnson, the chair of the committee, of cherry-picking details that would make Clinton look bad, and she challenged him to release all the documents he had. Under pressure, Johnson agreed to do so.Two weeks later, however, those papers still aren't out.The documents, which consisted of Johnson's correspondence with software companies about Clinton's private server, suggested the server was vulnerable to cyberattacks. Republicans have tried to argue that Clinton, who is now running for president, mishandled sensitive information as secretary of state.On Tuesday, Johnson told The Huffington Post that he believed those documents had already been released.""We agreed to release the information that Sen. McCaskill was asking for and we've done so,"" he said. ""We've given it to her, [and] I think we've probably released it to the public.""""The documents still aren’t public,"" McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said in response. The Homeland Security Committee's GOP staffers permitted McCaskill to personally view the documents once -- under their supervision -- but she was not allowed to keep them.Johnson's office clarified later on Tuesday that while McCaskill has reviewed all the documents, they are not yet public.""Our committee intends to release the documents once the redaction process is finished,"" a spokesperson for Johnson said. The office did not answer a question about when the documents are likely to be released.At the hearing, McCaskill said she wanted all the details about Clinton's documents to be made public because she was concerned that ""the selective release of information has created a public narrative that prejudges the outcome of the investigation and creates an incomplete and potentially misleading picture for the public of the record before the committee.""Johnson responded that the committee was ""all about transparency"" and accused McCaskill, a supporter of Clinton's presidential bid, of politicizing the issue.""If you're truly serious about working with me, I think you would have first talked to me privately,"" he said.The Senate Homeland Security Committee's investigation into Clinton's use of an email server is separate from the investigation being carried out by the House Select Committee on Benghazi -- which is supposed to be focusing on the 2012 terrorist attack in Libya, but has mostly been focusing on Clinton.Also on HuffPost:"

Following the failure of the Waxman-Markey bill, a piece of climate legislation Congress failed to pass in 2010, the Sierra Club and Bloomberg Philanthropies doubled down on their Beyond Coal campaign to ""circumvent a gridlocked Congress and work directly in states and with local community groups."" They ultimately secured the closure or planned closure of one-third of U.S. coal plants, and take some credit for the emissions reductions. “Thanks to the Beyond Coal campaign and the community leaders who have stood up against the coal industry, the U.S. is leading the world in cutting dangerous carbon pollution,” Michael R. Bloomberg, the UN secretary-general’s special envoy for cities and climate change, said in a statement released with the report. “The domestic reductions will give President Obama a strong negotiating hand at the U.N.’s climate summit in Paris and hopefully we can help lead the rest of the world in the same direction.”The report also found that economy-wide coal reduction will total approximately 5,357 metric tons this year, which is about 150 below the 2015 levels that would have been required by the Waxman-Markey bill.It's been a rough few years for the coal industry, another report from the energy finance research group Carbon Tracker found. In the last three years, 26 percent of U.S. coal companies have gone out of business. In the last five years, the remaining companies' value have dropped 76 percent.Also on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio said Wednesday that he'd eventually end protections for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children -- a move that would take away the ability to work legally from tens of thousands of so-called Dreamers.Rubio, the Florida senator who helped draft a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, has said previously that he would continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program until it can be replaced with immigration reform passed through Congress.That stance has come under fire from conservatives, however, who have accused him of continuing President Barack Obama's amnesty programs. He backed away from that position Wednesday.“It will have to end at some point,"" he said at an event in New Hampshire, according to Bloomberg Politics, adding that it would be ""ideal"" if it ended because Congress enacted reform.The comments were similar to past ones, but with one crucial difference: Previously he had emphasized that he wanted reform passed first.Breitbart News published a story Monday highlighting Rubio's comments in April to Univision's Jorge Ramos, who pressed him on whether he would rescind DACA. He said he wanted to end it eventually, but along with the passage of reform. ""I don't think we can immediately revoke that,"" Rubio said. ""I think it will have to end at some point and I hope it will end because of some reforms to the immigration laws. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States. But I'm not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow or this week or right away.""  Also in April, Rubio told MSNBC that DACA could not be the permanent U.S. policy and that he hoped it would come ""to an end because we've reformed our immigration laws."" He said he wouldn't end it immediately because ""it would be very disruptive."" That time as well, he emphasized the need for immigration reform to solve the problem.""Ultimately, there will come a point where it will have to end,"" he said. ""Maybe not in six months, but at some point it will have to end, and that's why there should be urgency about moving forward on immigration reform beginning with immigration enforcement.""DACA allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before the age of 16 to apply for two-year work permits, so long as they pass a background check and meet other criteria. More than 680,000 Dreamers -- named for the failed Dream Act that would give them a path to citizenship -- have received DACA protection so far. Because they need to reapply every two years, if a future president ended the program, all of those Dreamers would lose work authorization and be put back at risk of deportation. Obama attempted last November to expand DACA, including by making the work permits last three years and by creating a new program that conferred similar benefits to parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. The expansion of DACA and the new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, are currently stalled in the courts. Rubio has consistently spoke out against DAPA.The senator says he still supports reforming the immigration system, but now advocates for an enforcement-first approach rather than the comprehensive one he championed two years ago. A spokesman for Rubio did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on his Wednesday comments.This article has been updated to include additional past comments from Rubio.

He had faced previous complaints for excessive force.Some students at the school protested the firing, and media personalities including Glenn Beck came to Fields' defense.But 57 percent of the Americans who've heard about the story agree the officer acted inappropriately, while just 24 percent think he was in the right.

The initiative will make it possible for candidates receiving public funds to compete better in the landscape created after two Supreme Court decisions tightened restrictions on public funding and flooded elections with unlimited independent spending.In Seattle, voters backed a sweeping measure to enact public financing of the city’s elections by a vote of 60 percent to 40 percent. The measure will create a first-of-its-kind system of publicly funded “democracy vouchers” to be distributed to citizens to donate to candidates participating in the public funding system. Each citizen will be able to distribute four $25 vouchers to participating candidates. This goes along with a raft of other campaign finance, disclosure, ethics and lobbying reforms also included in the initiative.The passage of both measures signals a new front in the effort to reform and democratize campaign finance. Since the 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited election spending by corporations, unions and, following a subsequent lower court ruling, wealthy individuals, public distaste for the role of big money in politics has increased dramatically. At the same time, avenues for reform at the federal level have shrunk as Congress and the Supreme Court are controlled by conservatives opposed to reform.""Everyday Americans deeply believe in the patriotic ideals of a government of, by, and for the people and of striving to create a more perfect nation. For Americans who have lost faith in their government because they believe their elected officials don’t listen to everyone, these victories are a beacon of hope,"" David Donnelly, president and CEO of Every Voice, a campaign finance reform group that backed the initiatives in Maine and Seattle, said in a statement.As evidenced by the successes in Maine and Seattle on Tuesday, the effort to take the reform agenda to the states -- and directly to the people -- is succeeding. Another victory came in San Francisco, where voters passed a lobbying reform proposition that lays the groundwork for further changes. These reform wins follow on the heels of the 2014 vote in Tallahassee, Florida, to enact a limited public financing system in the city and reform lobbying and ethics laws.“Local, grassroots victories are how we fix our corrupt political system,” Josh Silver, director of Represent.Us, an anti-corruption group that backed the initiatives and propositions that passed on Tuesday, said in a statement. “Together we are building a movement, from the ground up, and fighting for a future where political outcomes are decided by the best ideas, not the biggest bank accounts.”The push for post-Citizens United reform at the state level owes its success not only to the design of getting the issue before a public primed to vote against big money, but also to the initiatives providing an affirmative path to reform through empowering the average citizen.Instead of focusing on passing initiatives that seek to limit, reformers are pushing policies to increase the role of small donors and non-donors in the funding of elections through public financing. These policies are often combined, as was the case in Seattle, with a package of ethics and lobbying reforms supported by conservative voters also concerned about the imbalance in government favoring the wealthy and well-connected.As lawmakers tend to percolate up from city councils to state legislatures and into Congress, reformers hope that their success at creating state- and local-level public financing systems will create a generation of lawmakers coming to Washington with experience in a public system and not in the current privately financed system. These lawmakers would be more willing to help create such a system at the federal level.For now, success in 2015 for reformers means only one thing: more ballot initiatives in states and cities in the 2016 elections."

Holtzclaw is accused of abusing his authority as a police officer to target, pull over and assault black women between the ages of 38 and 54 while on duty.Final jury selections were made on Tuesday and not only is the jury all-white, but it's also majority-male. This is concerning. Common strategy submits that a defense team should try to assemble a jury that best suits their client. Prospective jurors first fill out questionnaires, and then the judge and likely the lawyers converse with them. Some potential jurors are eliminated by attorneys on both sides ""for cause,"" such as people who are friends or relatives of the victims or the defendants. People who are or have relatives in law enforcement may also be eliminated, as well as anybody with friends or relatives who have had less than savory encounters with the police.Attorneys can also use a certain number of ""peremptory"" challenges to exclude people without giving a reason. These “gut feelings” can bias jury selection and give defense lawyers leeway to choose people who are more likely to side with their clients.The jury in the Holtzclaw trial consists of eight men and four women, all of whom are white. Holtzclaw's father is white and his mother is of Japanese decent. Three black men were rejected as jurors, according to Patricia Santos, a reporter with ABC affiliate KOCO.Jury pools are legally mandated to be representative of the jurisdiction’s demographics. Over half of Oklahoma City’s population is female and 16 percent of the city’s population is black, according to the most recent census data. But that doesn’t mean the entire population is in the eligible jury pool.Oklahoma has the second-highest incarceration rates for black men in the country. The state also incarcerates more women than any other state in the nation, with 127 of every 100,000 women being locked up -- double the national rate.This is just one example of how the legal system targets black Americans, and it has been heavily scrutinized for this bias. While many cases have attracted scrutiny for jury selection processes that appear to lean heavily on race as a deciding factor, the concerns extend beyond that in the Holtzclaw trial. Rape culture is a pervasive force in our society, which means the jury pool is less likely to understand or empathize with the victims.The selected group of jurors may find it hard to identify with the victims, with whom they don't share a common racial background, and likely don't share their experience of sexual violence, either. The victim-blaming element gets more complex when the alleged assailant is white and the brutalized person is black and female. Misogynoir -- a term coined in 2010 by Moya Baliey describing the intersection of racism and sexism -- is a brutal reality for black women. So even if one of the four white women on the jury has been sexually assaulted, she is still capable of demonizing a black woman as naturally promiscuous and, therefore, ""asking for it."" The bottom line, however, is that Holtzclaw and his alleged victims are products of a society where black women are routinely abused by white men in positions of power. And there are likely more victims than arrest or conviction rates show, since, according to the Department of Justice, for every black woman who reports her rape, at least 15 do not. For white women, at least five do not report their rapes for every white woman who does. The countless black women who have been sexually and physically abused by police officers and other authority figures doesn't help us speak out about this violence. This is a complex situation. The Holtzclaw trial is playing out against the backdrop of a broader historical narrative of white men in power targeting and assaulting black women. The selection of a jury that doesn't acknowledge such a history is not unbiased or capable of delivering a fair verdict.Update: This article has been updated with more specific information about Holtzclaw's racial background."

The recent completion of the state's largest solar array is a big help toward that goal, as well as toward the aggressive statewide goal of 100 percent renewable energy by 2045.Located in the small town of Anahola, along the island's eastern coast, the 12-megawatt, $54 million facility is 60 acres -- the size of about 45 football fields -- and has 59,000 solar panels.Kauai Island Utility Cooperative says it will replace 1.7 million gallons of imported oil per year and generate 20 percent of Kauai’s daytime energy needs -- enough to power 4,000 homes.While this is a big step for the Aloha state -- as well as Kauai's public utility co-op, the only utility in the state not owned by Hawaiian Electric Industries -- the Anahola facility pales in comparison to the country's largest solar power plants. Take California's Solar Star projects -- the largest photovoltaic power plant on the planet. Completed this past June, this 579-megawatt monster in Antelope Valley, California, has more than 1.7 million solar modules and delivers enough electricity to power approximately 255,000 homes. Upon its completion, Green Tech Media heralded it as a sign that ""the utility-scale solar business is alive and well."" Indeed, from the behemoths like Solar Star to the community-based efforts like Kauai's Anahola facility, utility-scale solar is making its mark across the country. In 2014, the utility photovoltaic sector installed 3,939 megawatts -- up 38 percent from 2013, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
