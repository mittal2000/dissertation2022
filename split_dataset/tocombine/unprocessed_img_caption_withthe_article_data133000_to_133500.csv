Loots and Leclair joke that they're getting married New Year's Day in front of 80 million of their closest friends, and the men say they aren't that concerned that a few thousand others may boycott the first gay marriage at the 125-year-old Rose Parade. (AP Photo/AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Eric Reed)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafc0092400005100969384.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dana FeldmanLOS ANGELES, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A gay Los Angeles couple plans to exchange wedding vows on a flower-covered float trundling through Pasadena during the nationally televised Tournament of Roses Parade on Wednesday, capping a momentous year for same-sex marriage in the United States.The planned nuptials of Danny Leclair, 45, and Aubrey Loots, 42, who have been together for 12 years and own a chain of hair salons, will mark the first same-sex marriage on a Rose Parade float in the 125-year history of the annual event, organizers say.But it won't be the only wedding ever to have been performed on one of the Rose Parade's flower petal-bedecked floats on national television.Wednesday's planned ceremony was preceded by two heterosexual couples tying the knot during separate processions in 1989 and last year.Leclair and Loots plan to make it official aboard a float shaped like a wedding cake coated in white coconut chips, accented with red kidney beans and festooned with 12,000 roses and other floral decorations, said Ged Kenslea, a spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.The foundation is sponsoring the float to celebrate same-sex marriage and the role it can play in helping to reduce new HIV infections among gay men, he said.Joining the couple for the parade will be a lesbian minister performing the ceremony and a lesbian couple, Sharon Raphael and Mina Meyer, who have been together 42 years and were legally married in California in 2008, Kenslea said.He said the group planned to time the ceremony to be conducted at about 9:45 a.m. local time during the 15-second window during which that float is expected to pass before television cameras during the live parade broadcast.Loots, who is originally from South Africa, and LeClair, a native of Canada, met at a Los Angeles nightclub and originally had planned for a relatively low-key wedding until the opportunity to exchange vows in the Rose Parade surfaced.""For me, I was moved by the stand that the AIDS Healthcare Foundation was taking,"" Leclair told Reuters on Monday at a staging area where finishing touches were being added to the float in a large warehouse in Irwindale, east of Los Angeles.Loots said he had been traveling when he got a message from his partner asking if he would want to get married on a Rose Parade float.""I said, 'You're crazy! Of course, let's celebrate our love in front of the world,'"" he recounted, adding that the couple were also motivated by the chance to offer hope to same-sex couples who in most states are still denied marriage rights.""Being on top of this cake floating down the road is truly for the men and women in the world that don't have these opportunities,"" he said.Wednesday's event comes at a time of increasing momentum for the cause of gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and in statehouses across the United States.As of this month, same-sex matrimony has been legally recognized in 18 states and the District of Columbia, with the tally more than doubling during the past year, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.The trend has gained steam since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2013 that married same-sex couples are eligible for federal benefits, striking down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act.

On Wednesday, a hacker website claimed that it had a list of the user names and phone numbers for 4.6 million people on Snapchat.The company behind Snapchat, a 2-year-old app that offers privacy in sending pictures between phones, was warned about the potential for hacking months ago. In August, the Internet security group Gibson Security, or GibsonSec, wrote that it found a vulnerability in Snapchat's friend-finder feature that would allow a hacker to discover the phone numbers behind user names in the app. When a Snapchat user signs up, he can privately register a phone number so friends who have the user in their phones' address books can find him in the app. GibsonSec reported that if a hacker uploaded a large list of numbers to a phone, the hacker could then find the phone number behind a Snapchat name.Four months later, Snapchat dismissed the potential security problem in response to another statement on the GibsonSec website, this one published Christmas Eve. The security company had said the issue hadn't been resolved.""Theoretically, if someone were able to upload a huge set of phone numbers, like every number in an area code, or every possible number in the U.S., they could create a database of the results and match usernames to phone numbers that way,"" the company wrote in a blog post shortly after Christmas. Without going into further detail, it added: ""We recently added additional counter-measures and continue to make improvements to combat spam and abuse.""It didn't work. On Wednesday, a website called SnapchatDB.info (currently down) claimed it was offering files with 4.6 million pairs of Snapchat names and phone numbers for anyone to download. The last two digits of each number and the last half of each user name were blurred out, but the unknown hackers behind the site stated that they would offer the entire database to interested parties ""[u]nder certain circumstances."" Snapchat has not responded to a request from HuffPost for comment on SnapchatDB.""This information was acquired through the recently patched Snapchat exploit and is being shared with the public to raise awareness on the issue,"" the anonymous hackers wrote on SnapchatDB. ""The company was too reluctant at patching the exploit until they knew it was too late and companies that we trust with our information should be more careful when dealing with it.""GibsonSec announced on its Twitter account that it was not involved in the hack, and the company is offering users a way on its website to find out if their Snapchat info was leaked.

The first ""Hobbit"" entry, ""An Unexpected Journey,"" clocks in as the most frequently pirated movie of 2013, according to new rankings released by TorrentFreak. ""Journey,"" which opened Dec. 14, 2012, and raked in more than $1 billion worldwide, was pirated a whopping 8.4 million times throughout the year via BitTorrent networks. Even in light of the movie's impressive box-office tallies, that figure is cringeworthy when compared to the additional revenue ""Journey"" could have made, had those illegal downloads come in the form of ticket and DVD sales. Two other commonly pirated movies (""Django Unchained,"" at No. 2, and ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" at No. 5) also came from 2012, while the other seven movies arrived this year. The complete Top 10: 1. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (8.4 million) 2. ""Django Unchained"" (8.1 million) 3. ""Fast & Furious 6"" (7.9 million) 4. ""Iron Man 3"" (7.6 million) 5. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (7.5 million) 6. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (7.4 million) 7. ""Gangster Squad"" (7.2 million) 8. ""Now You See Me"" (7 million) 9. ""The Hangover Part III"" (6.9 million) 10. ""World War Z"" (6.7 million)While it may be no surprise to see ""The Hobbit"" at No. 1, it does paint a different portrait than last year's most pirated movie. The critically reviled ""Project X,"" made for $12 million (compared to ""Hobbit's"" reported budget of at least $200 million), topped the list in 2012. ""Project X"" collected $103 million at the box office worldwide and accrued 8.7 million illegal downloads. The remainder of the Top 10 was more predictable, populated with big-budget releases like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,"" ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" ""Marvel's The Avengers"" and ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1.""Some of 2013's highest-grossing movies that did not make TorrentFreak's list include ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" ""Despicable Me 2,"" ""Man of Steel,"" ""Monsters University"" and ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" The rankings comprise downloads through mid-December, which is why the list skews more heavily toward movies released earlier in the year and in late 2012.We learned last week that ""Game of Thrones"" was 2013's most commonly pirated television show for the second consecutive year. ""Breaking Bad"" and ""The Walking Dead"" also saw high volumes of illegal traffic.For more on this year's movie rankings, head over to TorrentFreak."

As national teams prepare to take home golds, human rights organizations strive to shed light on Russian laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ community. Amidst this charged atmosphere, others hope for less controversial games. Egypt recently banned its athletes from displaying the Rabaa, a four-fingered hand gesture favored by supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood -- a group the Egyptian army ousted from power this past summer. The ban is clearly designed so that none of the nation's competitors embarrass the ruling regime on the international stage by brandishing their opponent's emblem.The Rabaa joins two other gestures that have graced the modern Olympics -- and shaped the course of global events in the twentieth century.   The Rabaa gesture (Source: Wikimedia Commons)In 1936, the Olympics headed to Berlin, only three years after Adolf Hitler's accession to power. For Nazi Germany, the games were an opportunity to showcase National Socialism and its racial politics on a world stage. But instead of convincing the world of the benefits of their new regime, the Nazis displayed the horrors of fascism. Western observers saw German crowds in the stadiums displaying fascist-salutes -- the arm and hand raised -- in terrifying unison.When African-American runner Jesse Owens earned four gold medals that year, the most of any athlete, he debunked social Darwinism in the eyes of history. Owens went to the podium to receive one of his medals and faced Hitler sitting on a dais. Contemporary accounts noted Hitler giving the track star a half-hearted fascist-salute, a sharp contrast with the Nazi leader's normally enthusiastic gesticulations to medal winners. (Interestingly enough, there is an official Olympic salute, which looks very similar to the fascist salute, and it was often difficult to tell which was which at the 1936 games. Because of the confusion, the Olympic salute has now fallen out of fashion.) (Source: Wikimedia Commons)Thirty-two years later, Owens returned to the Olympics for the 1968 games as an adviser to the American team. It was the height of the civil rights movement, and many African-American athletes advocated boycotting the games to protest discrimination. Owens helped convince them to take the field. Two runners, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, decided to show their support for the civil rights movement. After winning gold and bronze in the 200-meter sprint, both men donned black gloves and raised one hand in the ""black power"" gesture while standing at the podium after receiving their medals. The now iconic photograph of the two has come to represent the struggle for racial equality in America.  (Source: Wikipedia)Because the games are a visual spectacle, gestures carry enormous potential at the Olympics. Gestures transmit well by image, from the television to the photograph. And they are uniquely suited to this international event because gestures cross language and cultural barriers -- even if you did not understand German or English, you understood the meaning of the fascist salute in 1936 and the black power sign in 1968.In 2014, watch to see if the Rabaa joins the list of gestures that made Olympic history."

With the score tied at seven in the second quarter, South Carolina quarterback Connor Shaw took a shotgun snap from the 9-yard line and handed the ball off to wide receiver Pharoh Cooper, who was in motion and running across the formation. The freshman wideout then flipped the ball to receiver Bruce Ellington, who was coming back across the field from the far side. On the run, Ellington launched a pass across the field to Shaw behind two Wisconsin defenders in the end zone. Having caught the Badgers' secondary off guard, the senior QB reeled in the touchdown catch to give the Gamecocks a 13-7 lead. It was his first career catch. (GIF viz BuzzFeed Sports)Shaw would notch a rushing touchdown and three passing touchdowns in a stellar performance. With the senior quarterback accounting for five touchdowns, South Carolina would go on to defeat Wisconsin 34-24. ""Best quarterback in school history, maybe the best in the country today,"" Spurrier shouted after Shaw was named MVP of the Capital One Bowl."
