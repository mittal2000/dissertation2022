So, when you hear the beat, it's literally a bucket",2013-12-22,"NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 21: Entertainer Beyonce attends a release party and screening for her new self-titled album 'Beyonce' at the School of Visual Arts Theater on December 21, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Michael Stewart/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4462a200000e5000066a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By now, fans of Beyoncé have spent hours with the singer's recently released fifth studio album. The self-titled ""visual album"" sold over 1 million copies in the first five full days after its release. On Saturday afternoon, Beyoncé screened the corresponding videos at New York's School of Visual Arts and appeared in person to answer some previously submitted fan questions about the project.Among the topics addressed as fans ate popcorn from ""Beyoncé"" bags and drank sodas and huckleberry juice: motherhood, why Beyoncé shared more personal details of her life on this record than ever before and how she kept the entire effort under wraps until it hit iTunes. She also explained the birth of ""Yoncé,"" a nickname that's a motif throughout the album (a Justin Timberlake and The-Dream-penned track on the LP is entitled ""Yoncé,"" and the singer wears a necklace with the word on it in multiple videos):""We were in the studio, and Justin Timberlake started beating on buckets. So, when you hear the beat, it's literally a bucket. It was really organic, and it reminded me of being in middle school during the lunch breaks, when you just start freestyling. So we kept the buckets, and we went back and forth. I was very adamant about keeping it organic, because that whole element is what is so beautiful about it. And Dream just started, 'Yoncé on his mouth like liquor,' and I'm like, 'What does that mean?' But I love it, I think Beyoncé is Beyoncé, Mrs. Carter is Beyoncé, Sasha Fierce is Beyoncé. And I'm finally at a place where I don't have to separate the two. It's all pieces of me, and just different elements of a personality of a woman, because we are complicated.""Beyoncé also took fans into what it was like to finally let the project hit iTunes (the album landed in the digital retailer at midnight on Dec. 13). ""I just got off the stage, I had a glass of wine and my cousin Angie was like, 'Are you alright?' because I was talking to myself and I was terrified,"" Beyoncé shared. ""I was so scared. I had already gone through all the horrible ways it could go in my mind... I saw it live on iTunes and I waited for the first comment. Then I woke up the next morning and... [breaks into dance].""""We went through everything to keep it sacred and a surprise,"" the singer said. ""Because there's joy in that and it's missing, and that's something I was able to experience as a kid."" Beyoncé also spoke freely about being a mother, telling the crowd that ""it's amazing how motherhood changes you."" Framing the project as an exercise in opening up, the singer revealed that she ""took all the things about myself that I wanted to change and put it in my music."" ""More than the music, I'm proud of myself as a woman,"" she added. ""It's about loving your imperfections and the things that make you interesting, because I refuse to let anyone put me in a box.""When discussing why ""Beyoncé"" is more personal than previous albums (Beyoncé's husband Jay Z and daughter Blue Ivy appear in videos), the singer appeared to choke back tears. ""I have always been very generous, I have been generous on stage and take my pain and joy into my performance,"" she said. ""But I'm private... I think it just took me not being anyone's child. Once I had a child, I broke down that fourth wall. I feel liberated, and I feel like I can give my heart to people.""""My father taught me so, so much,"" she said of Matthew Knowles, who managed Beyoncé until 2011. ""When I decided to manage myself, it was important to me not to sign to some big company. I wanted to follow in Madonna's footsteps and be a powerhouse. When you get to this level, you don't have to share your money or your success... And we did it. And it's my company.""""This is my first album that -- of course I wanted people to love it and critics to love it and for it to be successful -- but my goal was not picking a No. 1 single,"" Beyoncé continued. ""My goal was putting together a body of work, and I just wanted to know that people cared about music. Honestly, I was at a point where everything feels the same. What I said in 'Ghost,' 'All the shit I do is boring,' is true. And if I could not challenge that, then maybe it was time for me to do something else or develop more artists, which is something that I could do, but just growth. I just hope that I continue to move forward and challenge myself. I think that now that I've become a mother, I just want my legacy to inspire people. That's the biggest goal, just having happiness and knowing that when people come to my shows, they can leave all the madness and leave there knowing that there is hope."""

Just five years ago she performed for the family of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

The passing of the bill has caused significant panic even before its assented.""",2013-12-21,"Gay rights activist Clair Byarugaba talks to journalists in Kampala on December 20, 2013. Uganda's parliament today adopted an anti-homosexuality bill that will see repeat offenders jailed for life, with lawmakers hailing it as a victory against 'evil'. Deputies voted overwhelmingly in favour of the text, which has been widely condemned by rights activists and world leaders -- with US President Barack Obama describing it as 'odious' and Nobel Peace laureate archbishop Desmond Tutu comparing it to apartheid. AFP PHOTO / Isaac Kasamani (Photo credit should read ISAAC KASAMANI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbfbd200000e800ff7166.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The ninth Parliament of Uganda on Friday passed the Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009, which punishes Ugandans charged with ""aggravated homosexuality"" with life imprisonment. Though the bill has yet to be signed into law by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, its implications have grave consequences for the LGBTQI community.""Today will go down in history as the worst day for LGBTQI identifying persons and human rights in general. The passing of the bill has caused significant panic even before its assented,"" said Mr. Mawadri, Legal/Human Rights Officer at Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG).Angel Collie, a Trans Gender Non Conforming Program Officer for Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC) within the Global Justice Institute spent the summer working with the LGBTQI community in Kampala, Uganda, and has spoken with community leaders since the bill's recent passage.""The Ugandan Parliament promised [the bill] would be a Christmas present to its people, but it still seems sudden and unexpected. With barely any time to emotionally process the bill, activists are holding a strategic planning meeting tomorrow in Kampala to come up with [next steps] and the safest response to this tragic situation,"" said Collie.SMUG and other advocacy rights groups are questioning whether Parliament had quorum to legally pass the legislation. Overwhelmingly supported by Ugandans, Collie stressed that LGBTQI people must prepare for every possible response to the bill, including increased police presence around Kampala: ""Already a [LGBTQI safety] workshop was raided before the bill was even passed. What does it mean that the police know where these people meet and are operating? There is a new level of risk for anyone involved, just for being who they are."" Hate message put up at a community center in Kampala.Not only does the legislation imprison individuals accused of homosexuality, individuals can also be charged who 'knew' or 'advocated' on behalf of homosexual conduct and did not report it to authorities, which creates a new risk of fear of punishment by association. The legislation is predicted to have a strong impact on decreased access to health care and mental health services for LGBTQI people. A recent study conducted by Freedom and Roam Uganda (FARUG) shows that currently 100 percent of the LGBTQI people interviewed would like, ""increased access to services such as counseling to cope with the daily stresses of life because LGTI persons (especially Tran's persons) face psychological torture in their daily lives from family, friends and the general public."" Further, 70 percent of interviewees could only access health care services if they did not disclose their sexual orientation, making increased risk to STIs more prevalent. Currently, Trans persons do not have access to HIV, mental health, STI or cancer screenings. With the new risk of imprisonment, less LGBTQI people may seek the services they desperately need. ""Time and time again, Trans and gender non-conforming members of the community are at a greater risk to be stalked or verbally and physically assaulted. While this does not downplay the trauma that other members of the community face, as a trans person myself I find these acts particularly heartbreaking. Everyone deserves equal access to care,"" said Collie. The Human Rights Campaign, Amnesty International and other international human rights organizations have called on Ugandan President Museveni to veto the discriminatory bill. ""LGBTQI people aren't going to cease to exist. People have expressed sexuality and gender differently in Uganda forever. This is not imported from the West, it's something that has always been a part of Ugandan culture. If anything has been imported by the West it's homophobia and transphobia from extreme conservative religious organizations,"" Collie stressed. As we watch from around the world, let us hope for the safety of all those working towards equality and fairness in Uganda."

Will the LDS Church keep throwing good money after bad? The Mormon Church ran and its members funded every anti-gay marriage vote in over 30 states since 1998. Take a look at these secret Mormon Church documents courtesy of Mother Jones Magazine. Last year it appeared that the LDS Church pulled the plug and bowed out of the gay marriage fight to avoid becoming an issue in the Romney campaign. This year after Romney was no longer a factor, the Mormon Church jumped right back in to the fray in Hawaii where it all began 15 years ago. The LDS Church unsuccessfully tried to block the gay marriage law from passing there during a recent special legislative secession called by Governor Abercrombie.Gay Weddings Start in UtahUtah has to be the line in the sand as far as the Mormon Church is concerned. It must really irk Church leaders like President Thomas S. Monson and the 12 Apostles to watch all the same-sex couples waiting in lines to get married throughout Utah. It is dominating the news cycle all over the state.Did Mormon Church Divorce NOM?The Mormon Church has had some tense moments with NOM, which it created in 2008 to qualify and pass California's Proposition 8. Four years later NOM founder's Maggie Gallagher and Brian Brown turned on Mormon candidate Mitt Romney and went all out for Rick Santorum who was nipping at Romney's heels at the time. That put a big strain in their relationship. There were always three prominent Mormon Church members on NOM's seven member Board. Apparently over the summer Orson Scott Card resigned because of the terrible backlash and boycott of his new movie ""Enders Game,"" because of Card and his homophobic rants. That still leaves Broc Hiatt and Craig D. Cardon as the Mormon representatives on the NOM Board. Pope Francis Time Magazine's Man of the YearTime will only tell on how much longer the Mormon Church stays in the losing battle to stop the freedom to marry and deny loving couples the same rights to marry and raise a family that they have fought for.Will Mormon Church leaders now send a softer, kinder message regarding gay marriage to help stop losing members and money since this issue divides the Church? It seems to be working for the Roman Catholic Church. I hope that seeing so much happiness and love in Utah in the last 24 hours will only encourage the Mormon Church change its ways. Only Time will tell.PS I would like to congratulate my good friend Jim Dabakis who married his partner of 27 years Steven Justesen yesterday. They were one of the first couples to get married by Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker."
