The site features a letter from the Amazon books team, asking customers to directly email Hachette's CEO, Michael Pietsch, and tell him to ""stop working so hard to overcharge for e-books.""The move appears to be a direct rebuttal to an earlier letter signed by over 900 authors -- including both authors who've been published by Hachette and ones who have not -- that asks readers to contact Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO and founder, and weigh in on the matter. The letter, which is signed by best-selling authors like Stephen King and Barbara Kingsolver, as well as many others, will be published in a full-page ad in Sunday's New York Times, according to Bloomberg.The two letters are the latest shots fired in a dispute between the two companies over e-book prices. In May, Amazon began holding Hachette hostage by raising prices and refusing to restock some Hachette titles on its site. In its letter published Friday, Amazon argued that Hachette is preventing it from lowering e-book prices. ""E-books can and should be less expensive,"" the retail giant wrote in its letter. ""Hachette has already been caught illegally colluding with its competitors to raise e-book prices.""But in their open letter, the authors maintain that Amazon is unfairly holding them hostage by refusing to sell certain books.""It is not right for Amazon to single out a group of authors, who are not involved in the dispute, for selective retaliation,"" the open letter, penned by the author Douglas Preston, reads. ""Moreover, by inconveniencing and misleading its own customers with unfair pricing and delayed delivery, Amazon is contradicting its own written promise to be 'Earth's most customer-centric company.'""In a statement provided to The Huffington Post on Saturday, Preston, who writes thriller novels, said that Amazon's letter misrepresents the authors' views, and the writers ""take no position on the dispute between Amazon and Hachette."" Preston wrote:What we are united on is this: we strongly object to Amazon blocking and impeding the sales of books, hurting authors, and inconveniencing readers as a negotiating strategy. We authors helped Amazon become one of the largest corporations in the world. Amazon used book sales as the cutting edge to selling everything. And yet, when Amazon gets in a dispute with a publisher over terms, it retaliates against the authors by blocking or otherwise impeding the sales of their books. Surely Amazon has other negotiating tools in its portfolio without targeting authors and damaging our livelihoods every time they get into a rough patch negotiating with a publisher. It's as simple as that.Pietsch, Hachette's chief, and a representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday."

Speaking at a luncheon panel at the annual convention of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Phil Griffin apologized several times for the segment that aired on May 5 of this year, in which a journalist wandered around in a sombrero drinking tequila straight from the bottle to commemorate the holiday.""It was an embarrassment to me personally, and to the company,"" Griffin said in his opening remarks at the panel.Despite the apologies, the Cinco de Mayo segment and the seeming problem with network diversity it highlighted surfaced several times during the event, both in questions from the audience and in prodding from Griffin's co-panelist Alex Nogales, an advocate with the National Hispanic Media Coalition. Nogales' group pushes for better representation of Hispanics in the media and entertainment industries. Nogales asked whether Griffin and MSNBC hosts would agree to have a meeting with a group of Latino experts to discuss how the network could better cultivate Hispanic sources and experts to interview on the air.Griffin said he’d go one step further, asking to organize meetings on a continual basis and to bring producers into the meetings as well.Diversifying the network isn't just the right thing to do, Griffin said, it also makes business sense.  “There is a huge audience out there,” Griffin said, referring to Latinos. “And I want us to be the first one to tap into it in a really positive way.”Griffin also noted during the panel that journalist José Díaz-Balart had recently joined the network to anchor on weekdays at 10 a.m. “Having José in the newsroom has already changed our world,” Griffin said. He added that Díaz-Balart has helped make the network more representative of U.S. demographics by bringing Hispanic sources on air to talk about topics other than immigration.The MSNBC reporters involved in the segment have already apologized on air, but Griffin said that he'd also met with every department at MSNBC to discuss the issue.To show his contrition, Griffin said the segment had embarrassed him so badly that just seeing a sombrero raises the ugly memory.“When I walk by a Mexican restaurant, I get nervous,” Griffin said. “When I see a sombrero, I get upset.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article identified Alex Nogales' group as the Hispanic Media Coalition. It is the National Hispanic Media Coalition."

Back in the early '90s, shortly following ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Princess Bride,"" Wright was poised to become our Sweetheart.

Plus I was too busy being a mom at the time."" She also cited not doing a Vanity Fair cover to promote ""Forrest Gump"" as the reason she didn't get a lot of the films she was interested in at the time. ""I remember, after that, not getting a couple of movies that I really wanted to do. And I was told, 'Well, you know, if you had done Vanity Fair it might have been different.' It was like I'd made this big mistake.""At this point we have to imagine a giant machine, whirring and flashing lots of unnecessary lights. A studio executive stands in front. ""Just step inside, Robin,"" he says menacingly, as he gestures to her with a hand drawn from his velveteen cape. He begins typing ""A-M-E-R-I-C-A-S-S-W-E-E-T-H-E-A-R-T"" into the dash, but she stops him: ""I won't get into this giant whirring machine OR do Vanity Fair!"" she yells, tossing off her heels and running away.And so the rest is history. Wright knows that Jenny and Buttercup will probably always be her biggest roles, but she's gotten a lot of work in recent years and managed to do it all sans Botox. Whether that would be the case if she had stepped into the whirring machine and been transformed into a Sweetheart, we shall never know. [h/t The Guardian]"

(AP Photo/Scott Cohen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ed5724000050005727f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Seattle megachurch pastor Mark Driscoll has been removed from a church-planting network of more than 500 churches he helped found after a pattern of “ungodly and disqualifying behavior.”Driscoll, co-founder of the Acts 29 Network, has been an influential but edgy pastor within conservative evangelical circles for several years. His own Mars Hill Church attracts some 14,000 people at 15 locations across five states each Sunday.At the same time, however, Driscoll has been controversial in evangelical circles for years. The New York Times Magazine called him “one of the most admired — and reviled — figures among evangelicals nationwide.” He has been provocative, occasionally profane and has faced allegations of plagiarism and inflating his book sales.After Acts 29 board action, all of Driscoll’s Mars Hill Church locations have been removed from the website of the network.“It is our conviction that the nature of the accusations against Mark, most of which have been confirmed by him, make it untenable and unhelpful to keep Mark and Mars Hill in our network,” the Act 29 board wrote in a letter. “In taking this action, our prayer is that it will encourage the leadership of Mars Hill to respond in a distinctive and godly manner so that the name of Christ will not continue to be dishonored.”In a longer letter obtained by blogger Warren Throckmorton, the Acts 29 board asked Driscoll to “step down from ministry for an extended time and seek help.”“Over the past three years, our board and network have been the recipients of countless shots and dozens of fires directly linked to you and what we consider ungodly and disqualifying behavior,” the board wrote. “We have both publicly and internally tried to support and give you the benefit of the doubt, even when multiple pastors in our network confirmed this behavior.”Driscoll, who’s been facing the same heavy criticism in recent years that he was known for dishing out to others, recently admitted to and apologized for comments he made under the pseudonym “William Wallace II” where he posted statements critical of feminism, homosexuality and “sensitive emasculated” men.The Acts 29 board’s letter suggested that it could not lean on Mars Hill’s own board for discipline.“In response, we leaned on the Mars Hill Board of Advisors & Accountability to take the lead in dealing with this matter,” the letter states. “But we no longer believe the BoAA is able to execute the plan of reconciliation originally laid out. Ample time has been given for repentance, change, and restitution, with none forthcoming. We now have to take another course of action.”As Throckmorton has reported on his blog, the Acts 29 action comes after evangelical leaders Paul Tripp and James MacDonald resigned as members of the church governing board, and ex-members staged a recent protest at the church.The Acts 29 Network is a network of churches attempting to be “gospel-centered” and “missional.” Its mission is to plant new churches with an emphasis on holiness, humility, diversity and evangelism.Driscoll stepped down as president of Acts 29 in March 2012, appointing Matt Chandler as his successor and moving the headquarters to Dallas, where Chandler is a pastor.Driscoll’s spokesperson did not return requests for comment.Earlier this year, Driscoll apologized for missteps in publishing and quit social media for the rest of 2014."

The year's fundraising is 86 percent higher than the Hanover, New Hampshire, college's five-year annual average of $154.6 million.The fundraising surge came less than a year after Dartmouth posted a 14 percent drop in student applications, the largest decline in 21 years. The college said alumni donations reinforced confidence in Phil Hanlon, who was installed as president of the Ivy League college last summer. Ann Root Keith, Dartmouth's chief operating officer of advancement, said it was possible the application decline spurred alumni to contribute.""This is a supportive group of men and women who have graduated from the college and want to do well by their alma mater,"" Root Keith said in an interview Friday. She added: ""Both their giving and volunteering demonstrate their confidence in the institution."" The application drop followed national attention on alleged hazing in the college Greek system and federal investigations for Dartmouth's response to sexual violence and harassment. Students have demonstrated repeatedly on campus over concerns about sexual assault, racial issues and treatment of the LGBT community.Dartmouth said 113 alumnae made donations that topped $100,000 each. The college declined to detail the largest donation from among those women, called the Centennial Circle of Dartmouth Alumnae, but said it raised a total of $14.8 million from that group. The Centennial Circle had hoped to collect donations from 100 women. ""The Centennial Circle is a testament to the truth that Dartmouth women make things happen,"" Lanie McNulty, co-chair of the alumnae group, said in a statement. ""We set a daring goal and broke right through it.""Hanlon vowed earlier this year to end ""extreme behavior"" on campus, and hosted a national summit on sexual assault in July. Root Keith said alumni rallied behind Dartmouth hosting the summit.""Efforts around that conference, and in moving Dartmouth forward, they're eager to support that,"" Root Keith said. ""They like the idea of leading.""The Dartmouth College Fund saw donations from nearly 24,000 alumni, ""representing a participation rate of 42.8 percent -- second-highest in the Ivy League and among the highest in the country,"" according to the school."

The hard-line fighters now appear set on trying to take the Kurdish capital.The grave threat to Arbil, seat of the regional government and a hub for foreign firms in Iraq, appears to have at least temporarily eased a long-running feud between leaders of the Kurdistan region, who have long dreamed of an independent state, and the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shi'ite Arab who has sparred with Kurds over land and oil.As Islamic State fighters made another dramatic advance earlier this week, Maliki ordered his air force for the first time to back Kurdish forces in their fight against militants.The delivery of ammunition on Friday is sure to be welcome for Kurdish officials who for weeks have complained the Peshmerga, whose name means ""those who face death,"" were overstretched and underequipped against the Islamist fighters, who have weapons seized from Iraqi army bases.Both steps are significant in a country where in recent years Peshmerga and Iraqi forces under the command of Baghdad have been much closer to fighting each another than to cooperating.'QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE'The Obama administration is now working with the Iraqi government, the official said, to ensure additional requests from the Kurdistan Regional Government, for small arms and munitions including mortars and AK-47s, will be met soon.""We're still coordinating with the government of Iraq to help fill the needs as quickly as possible,"" the official said.While the shipment delivered on Friday came from existing Iraqi government stockpiles, the U.S. official said, it was not clear whether additional arms that Baghdad may provide to Kurdistan would come from Iraq's existing arsenal or would come from the United States via Baghdad.The Obama administration has been reluctant to directly provide weapons to Iraqi Kurds because it would set a precedent for circumventing an allied government and would raise objections from Baghdad.But the recent Islamic State advance has revealed worrying vulnerabilities of the Kurdish force. After many Iraqi soldiers abandoned their posts in the face of the initial Islamic State onslaught, the Peshmerga appeared much more battle-ready. But the Peshmerga too have been routed in the past week.While the Obama administration has been reluctant to return to military action in Iraq after the long, bloody war that began in 2003, ensuring that hard-line militants cannot enter Arbil, the site of a U.S. consulate and a joint U.S.-Kurdish military operations center, is a priority.U.S. officials, seeking to ensure the current campaign does not drag the United States into broader military action in Iraq, believe greater cooperation between Iraq's feuding ethnic and sectarian factions is critical to defeating the Islamic State.

These problems can only be solved with Iraqi political solutions.This was reinforced by the President himself late Thursday evening: ""There's no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq.""I pray their words are sincere. Certainly the experience of our Nation overseas militarily over the last 13 years supports no other narrative.If American bombs and bullets were the answer to the civil wars and political disorder in the Muslim world, then the situation would have been resolved in Iraq in 2003. The Obama Administration's surge of nearly 70,000 troops into Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010 would have produced reconciliation among the Afghans and not the bloodshed of the last five years. The American bombs that fell on Libya in 2011 would have created peace rather than the civil war that is still ravaging Libya's countryside and cities. Getting re-involved militarily in Iraq's ongoing civil war would be a mistake. Yes, the current civil war is a result of our 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation, and yes, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is horrid and barbarous. It would be a feel-good, guilt-assuaging, self-justifying exercise to drop bombs, particularly with the images of desperate and dying refugees haunting our television and computer screens. Neoconservatives and liberal interventionists in both parties could applaud this exercise of American ""leadership"", regardless of how ineffective or counter-productive the results are. But any help our bombs would provide would be short-lived, completely one-sided and would serve to exacerbate Iraq's civil war. Sure, we can bomb and we can kill, but then what?In the North of Iraq, many of Iraq's Sunnis have aligned themselves with ISIS out of political necessity. This alignment has given ISIS the manpower and popular support needed to conquer territory and continue their campaign of terror against non-Sunni Iraqis. This alignment comes as Iraq's Sunnis find themselves disenfranchised and marginalized by Nouri al-Maliki's Shia dominated, and horribly corrupt and cruel, government in Baghdad. Excluded from the government and security forces, as well as large shares of revenue from oil exports, Iraq's Sunni minority finds themselves, as many Sunnis see it, not just as losing in a contest for relevance, representation and resources, but in an existential fight for survival. Re-entering the Iraqi civil war, whether by backing Maliki's Shia dominated forces or the forces of the semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region, will put the United States back in a position of supporting one side against the Sunnis, just as occurred from 2003-2006 when the Sunnis, with similarly no other choice, sided with ISIS' predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq. Further marginalization of an already desperate Sunni population will push them closer to ISIS. Any goal we have in Iraq, and I say that fully recognizing how much we have already overstepped any reasonable bounds in that country with our previous invasion and occupation, should be to re-integrate the Sunni population back into the government, the security forces and revenue. Bombing the Sunnis will force them closer to ISIS, while strengthening an exclusive government in Baghdad. Similar to the mistakes made in Afghanistan by backing Hamid Karzai's corrupt and exclusionary government with military force, continuing to do the same in Iraq will only provide incentive to al-Maliki's government not to reform. Answering the political grievances of the Sunni population is the only way to peace and stability in Iraq. Such a path is not available through 500-pound bombs or depleted uranium shells.I am confident of only a few things. I believe the future holds more terror and bloodshed for the Iraqi people and I am confident of our culpability in that death and destruction. However, I am also confident that, as President Obama rightly stated, America's military will not fix an Iraqi political problem.I am also confident, that 11.5 years after we deposed him from power, Saddam Hussein is laughing from his grave.Just as public pressure stopped the United States from getting involved in the middle of Syria's Civil War in 2013, calls to Congress will have a similar effect on any potential American entry into the Iraqi Civil War. Please call your senators and representative and tell them to keep American soldiers out of Iraq."

Obama says he's authorized the U.S. military to carry out airstrikes in Iraq against Islamic militants if they advance toward the city of Erbil.(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d25e2500008e013a533f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama's announcement that the United States' will protect 40,000 Yazidis trapped on Sinjar Mountain in northern Iraq is a decisive and timely response to an unfolding humanitarian disaster. Airdrops of water and food, already under way, will save lives.The Yazidis, however, will not really be safe until they can get off the desert mountain and back to their homes in Sinjar. This will require American airstrikes in combination with the ongoing campaign by the Kurdistan military, known as the peshmerga, to retake the city. President Obama has said he will authorize airstrikes, if necessary, to save the Yazidis, and they probably will be.The Yazidis are Kurdish-speaking adherents to an ancient religion that considers that God is the creator of all, including good and evil. Because they consider Satan to be one of God's creations, many Muslims denigrate the Yazidis as devil worshippers and they have often faced greater persecution than other religious minorities. Needless to say, ISIS reviles them.In their public decrees, ISIS gave the Yazidis a choice between converting to Islam and death. In Sinjar, the killings came so rapidly that it seems unlikely that anyone had the option to convert. As the terrorists set about massacring the men, they announced that the women would serve as temporary ""wives"" for ISIS fighters. In effect, ISIS has announced a program of rape that should outrage Americans much as the mass rapes in Bosnia did two decades ago.President Obama has rightly accused ISIS of genocide. Article 2 of the Genocide Convention defines genocide as killing members of a group ""with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such."" There is no doubt that ISIS' killings are intended to destroy the Yazidis as a religious group. Article 4 makes clear that the Convention applies not only to duly constituted governments but also to individuals and organizations, such as ISIS.In her 2002 book, A Problem from Hell, Samantha Power describes the Clinton Administration's contortions to avoid characterizing as genocide the killings of the Muslims in Bosnia and Tutsi in Rwanda. The reason for not using the g-word was, as Power explains, simple. If the killings were genocide, the U.S. would be morally and legally obliged to act to prevent it.By using the term genocide, President Obama is obligating the United States to act to save Iraq's Yazidis and threatened Christians. This is not a small undertaking. The Yazidis and many of Iraq's Christians live in the borderlands between the Kurdistan region and the territory that had been controlled by Baghdad. After the Iraqi Army abandoned these areas in June, the peshmerga took over security. When I visited the borderlands at the end of June, Kurdish leaders explained that they were now defending a 650-mile front against a highly mobile ISIS that was armed with modern American supplied weapons, all abandoned or turned over the collapsed Iraqi army. The United States, they complained, refused to sell Kurdistan weapons and they feared being outgunned. This week, their fears were realized. The peshmerga's small arms proved ineffective against the hundreds of American armored Humvees used by ISIS. ISIS has used its advantage in mobility and arms to drive the peshmerga out of Sinjar, the Mosul dam area and several Christian towns. When ISIS attacks, civilians panic, particularly in Christian and Yazidi villages. This complicates the task of the Kurdish defenders, who not only must confront a ruthless foe, but must also look after terrorized civilians.Although the peshmerga withdrew from certain areas, their units are still intact and they have their arms. Unlike the largely defunct Iraqi Army, the peshmerga can take advantage of US airstrikes. And, this week, the Obama Administration reversed a decade-long embargo on arming the peshmerga and began sending in arms. More will be needed, along with training.President Obama, acting under the guise of protecting U.S. diplomats and military in the city, has committed U.S. air power to the defense of the Kurdistan capital, Erbil. This is not only a morale booster to the strongly pro-American Kurds, it will allow Kurdish commanders to shift forces away from the capital to the defense of the vulnerable borderlands.President Obama's response to the Yazidi genocide has been swift and unambiguous. In four decades of working in war zones, I can't think of any other case where the United States responded so quickly to a humanitarian disaster. And except for the 1999 intervention to save Kosovo, the United States has an unfortunate record of identifying genocides only after they have taken place, and not when they could be prevented.While moving to save Iraq's religious minorities, President Obama has articulated a new American approach to genocide. As the President said: ""When we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye. We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide.""In Iraq, the United States is acting with the authorization of the federal government in Baghdad. ISIS has no friends in the United Nations and, while not legally necessary, President Obama might usefully seek Security Council endorsement of his words and actions. It could set a useful precedent for prompt global action to deal with future genocides.The president has taken a great deal of criticism in recent months for a perceived excess of caution and lack of resolve in U.S. foreign policy. But what he articulated this week should change that perception. Perhaps, some day, it may even be spoken of with admiration as the Obama doctrine."

Mark's late grandfather flops off the table and into the fishbowl by a plaid couch. Mark pulls money from his shoe and counts out two fives and three ones; but before he can hand the bills to the shark -- who is now sitting on the couch smoking a cigarette -- his grand(fish)father leaps out of the fishbowl and eats the money.Welcome to the world of dreams! Like Mark, when we dream, we accept and often do not question the bizarre and implausible happenings within our nightly narratives. But why do we -- and Mark -- accept this? If we press Mark a bit on the details of the dream, he may be able to remember and describe his logical chess moves and the money counting. But chess-playing goldfish and literal loan sharks certainly defy logic. Another example of the inconsistency of dream logic comes from ""Susan,"" who dreamt that she was performing in a play. Susan, who had not acted in a play for years, was again a young woman:I was walking behind the leading lady when she suddenly collapsed and water was dripping on her. I ran over to her and felt water dripping on my back and head. The roof was leaking. I was very puzzled why she fell down and decided some plaster must have fallen on her. I looked up and there was a hole in the roof. I dragged her over to the side of the stage and began pulling the curtains. Although Susan did not question her recovered youth, she was able to use her logic to analyze the problem with the falling plaster and leaking roof. Why do dreams allow belief in the impossible, yet still retain some logical thought?Theories explaining why we accept the altered reality of our dreams are most often associated with the research of Sigmund Freud. Freud believed that dreams play out a healing or an emotional process. Whether to help us resolve life issues or personal conflicts, the dreamer needs to believe the dream experience to be real. According to Freud, to keep us believing in our nightly narratives, our subconscious represses doubt and critical thinking. Freud believed in dream symbols. In Mark's dream, there may have been some anger or hostility in his relationship with his grandfather (shark), something possibly related to symbols of self-worth or personal values (money). Regardless of interpretation, the dream needs Mark to believe its veracity to work its therapeutic magic; if Mark realizes that his grandfather is not a goldfish, he may wake up laughing or disappointed that he merely beat a fish in chess. Another explanation points to the unexpressed wish. In the context of Susan's dream, she may be fulfilling a wish to be young and on the stage acting again. The roof may symbolize success, but it is falling (failed career?) and she needs to protect the leading lady (mother?). The dream will not allow her to utilize her logic (which was applied to the rain and falling plaster) to question the reality of the story. The emotional healing or learning function of the dream requires belief.Challenging the idea of dreams having a purpose, psychologist Allan Hobson saw dreams as makeshift stories stemming from random brain activity. In a sense, the dreamer makes the best of a bad script, and the result can be nonsensical. Because areas of the brain that sustain working memory are weakened, logic is compromised during dreams. Hence, the dreamer accepts bizarre situations and shifts in time and space as real. Mark's chess moves and Susan's avoidance of the falling plaster are somewhat logical but fuzzy. Some of the most memorable and vivid dreams we have are as children. Who hasn't dreamt of being chased by a monster or two during those formative years? Psychologist Jean Piaget, who studied children's dreams, described how children's acceptance of dreams gradually change from belief of dreams as reality to knowing that dreams are but a story inside their heads. Perhaps we begin our sleeping life believing that dreams are real because we are born dreaming. Newborns are in REM an average eight hours per day. REM is the sleep period considered most favorable for ordinary dreaming. The dream world is, in many ways, our first and natural world, and the waking world with all of its rules comes later.

17,QUEER VOICES,It's Time to Expel Michele Bachmann From Congress,"Walt Hawkins, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-time-to-expel-michele_b_5661424.html,"Personally, I don't believe my tax dollars should be used to pay the salary of someone who wants to convince the world that my ultimate desire is to be able to legally molest children.",2014-08-09,"NATIONAL HARBOR, MD - MARCH 08: U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) speaks during the 41st annual Conservative Political Action Conference at the Gaylord International Hotel and Conference Center on March 8, 2014 in National Harbor, Maryland. The conference, a project of the American Conservative Union, brings together conservatives polticians, pundits and voters for three days of speeches and workshops. (Photo by T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcbcc3c000066000ba2ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a recent interview on conservative radio show Faith & Liberty, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minnesota) warned that the gay community ultimately wants to ""abolish age-of-consent laws, which means we will do away with statutory-rape laws so that adults will be able to freely prey on little children sexually. That's the deviance that we're seeing embraced in our culture today.""Of course, Bachmann offered absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support her claim, most likely because there is none. It's an outright lie. A supposed inherent link between homosexuality and pedophilia has been disproven time and again. Consequently, the canard that gay people -- gay men, specifically -- wish to sexually exploit children, which was once commonly held in America, has, more recently, been reduced to fodder for far-right homophobes. Granted, Bachmann certainly falls into that demographic, but the scope of her influence far outreaches that of an average private citizen.In the same interview Bachmann went on to state that the gay community also wishes to legalize polygamy and enact ""hate-speech laws across the United States"" in order to bring about the ""rise of tyranny.""This latest incident isn't Bachmann's first foray into the arena of blatant homophobia. She's been peddling inflammatory myths about the gay community and representing those myths as indisputable truths throughout her stint as a congresswoman, all the while insisting that her message ""is to spread goodness and joy and wholeness and healing.""In the marketplace of shameless fear-mongering, Michele Bachmann can certainly hold her own amongst the usual cast of right-wing characters. However, a great deal of Bachmann's rhetoric is typically irresponsible and borders on slander. For instance, in another recent interview Bachmann implied that unaccompanied minors fleeing the violence in Central America, who have come in large numbers to the Southern U.S. border, will be allowed into the country by President Obama so they can be put into foster care and used for ""medical experimentation."" How much longer will Bachmann be allowed to make such wild, completely unfounded accusations with impunity?Now, don't get me wrong. I'm all for individuals being able to freely express an opinion. And I understand that it's important to play to your audience. But these are no mere opinions, and Bachmann is no mere individual. And this latest incident isn't Bachmann's first foray into the arena of blatant homophobia. What Bachmann is doing is presenting an erroneous and incendiary scenario as truth. We've heard it before, but what makes this instance all the more disturbing is the simple fact that Bachmann isn't some washed-up 1950s-beauty-pageant contestant, nor is she some huckster televangelist. Bachmann is a member of the Congress of the United States. She has the power to introduce bills and resolutions, and to vote on whether or not they should be enacted into law. When Bachmann was sworn in for her fourth and current term in Congress, she stated on her website, ""It is a true honor to represent the citizens of Central Minnesota in the United States Congress."" Given her opinion of the gay community, I don't believe Bachmann is genuinely capable of fulfilling that duty, nor does she have any inclination to do so. After all, Bachmann must be aware that a segment of the population of Central Minnesota is made up of gays and lesbians. Otherwise, Bachmann & Associates, the counseling center founded by Bachmann's husband, Marcus, wouldn't have considered it necessary to offer conversion ""therapy"" to its clients. And Bachmann has campaigned tirelessly against same-sex marriage in Minnesota throughout her political career.Bachmann has hinted that she will not seek reelection at the end of her current term in Congress. She has also vaguely hinted at another run for the U.S. presidency. I don't think there is even the slightest chance that Bachmann could be elected to run the country. History has proven that. Regardless, I believe she should be expelled from Congress. Our system of government was created to be ""of the people, by the people and for the people."" The ""people"" includes the LGBT community, and government officials such as Michele Bachmann are not only not for us; they are pathologically against us. Personally, I don't believe my tax dollars should be used to pay the salary of someone who wants to convince the world that my ultimate desire is to be able to legally molest children."

I can no longer avoid pondering all the uncomfortable thoughts Israel's bombing of Gaza is bringing home to me. Of one thing I'm sure of -- I want to tell Netanyahu, ""I told you so."" Netanyahu's purpose was always designed to prevent any chance of rapprochement. What's unfolding was foretold by his actions. Jewish settlers taunt a Palestinian woman has just been evicted from her homeNetanyahu has forced me to question my relationship to Israel in a fundamental way. I have some strong credentials as a Jew. I come from the centuries-old Schneersohn dynasty of the Chabad movement of Hasidic Judaism. When the last rebbe, who was the closest thing to a pope Judaism ever had, died, his followers expected he would be the messiah. It turned out he just died, and was not the messiah. During that period, when they were looking for his replacement, some powerful Lubavitchers approached me. I was more of the bloodline than the last rebbe, so my bloodline made me attractive to them. Even when I pointed out I was not a good candidate -- that I was an atheist and a socialist, they wanted to keep talking. Of course, being an atheist and a socialist would not have saved me from the death camps, quite the contrary. So we talked. In the end it was not to be. But as a Jew, I was deeply affected by my knowledge of the Holocaust. My study of the Holocaust became an obsession. For many years, I accepted that as a Jew, it was good to have an Israel at my back. Or so I thought. In case California became a great Auschwitz, I could go to Israel. But now, Mr. Netanyahu has precluded me from that connection to the land of my ancestors. I feel no kingship with a man like Netanyahu.Despite being an atheist and a socialist, I spent nearly 10 years editing the old B'nai Brith Messenger, one of Los Angeles' pioneer newspapers. When it folded, it was nearly a century old. It had a long career as the voice of Los Angeles' Jewish community. It had begun as the newsletter of the B'nai Brith Congregation.I interviewed Abba Eban at some length in the Messenger in 1987.Abba Eban was one of Israel's greatest elder statesman. It was Abba Eban who pleaded the cause of Israel before the United Nations in 1948, and obviously did so well. He was a former deputy prime minister, foreign affairs minister, an ambassador to the UN and the U.S. But he also believed in a world, and an Israel, that was diverse, progressive and peaceable. When I interviewed Eban, he was excited about a discovery he had made about Los Angeles -- he liked the great mix of people in Los Angeles -- the Latinos, the Asians, the Jews and blacks and other Middle easterners. He said it was a very good thing. It was like Abba Eban, one of the great founder of the nation of Israel, had founded nirvana not in Jerusalem but in Los Angeles.""It's a healthy thing,"" he told me. ""It diminishes the sense of national assertion that has brought so many disasters. Most nations accept a pluralistic view of faith, of identity.""Eban's other big concerns at the time was the rise of the Israeli right. ""You cannot occupy a foreign country and be a member of the Democratic world. There has to be a choice. Many Israelis want three things that are not compatible. We want a Jewish state, a democratic state and to maintain our rule over the territories. You can't have all three,"" he said.He bemoaned that Israel's victory in 1967 had made Israel substantially less democratic. And as a great scholar of human history, which he was, he was bothered by the rise of fundamentalism in his own land. ""You can't be satisfied with what the bible says when it says we should smash the heads of a child against the rocks,"" he noted.Eban warned his fellow Israelis that the land won in the 1967 war was dangerous to hang on to because it put Israeli in a ""totally untenable situation."" They would not be able to be democratic and also oppressive to their neighbors, he said. Inevitably, war would break out over and over again.So even more than three decades ago, Eban was here in Los Angeles warning that if Israel tried to hold on to the territories, that would preclude any peace.The latter seems well on point. Yeah, Hamas are religious fanatics and killers. But they have their Jewish counterparts -- Netanyahu, for one. And then there's the element that became the ugliest part of Israeli politics. Mostly from Brooklyn, and followers of the Jewish fascist Rabbi Meir Kahane, they came to reclaim the glorious lands of Judea after the 1967 War.I interviewed Kahane once -- I remember I was with him face to face, and he had these strange ticks and twitches marching across his face. There also was an unsettling intensity in his eyes. He unnerved me, and I came away feeling he was strange and evil.I thought the man a monster, even if as a kid I used to get beaten up going home through the alley from Woodrow Wilson High School because I was a Jew. I was starting to read about anti-Semitism, the '30s, the Holocaust, so the expression ""Never again,"" which Kahane invented, connected with me. The members of this gang of Christian thugs took turns slugging me, as they called me a 'Christ Killer.' The leader of the Christian thugs was a Baptist minister's son.I learned about Christian thugs early, but how to classify a Netanyahu? I see Kahane and Netanyahu as the same person. When I heard Netanyahu wishing out loud that someone would kill Prime Minister Rabin who he said was a traitor because he signed a peace treaty with Arafat, I could tell this was a thug. I learned there were Christian thugs, who wanted to kill me. But how to deal with Jewish thugs, like Bibi Netanyahu, the current prime minister. Rabin was assassinated in 1995. Netanyahu should have been thrown in jail for inciting his assassination, but he wasn't. He and his kind took over in Israel, and set in motion the events that could only lead to more war. He wanted to set up roadblocks to any permanent peace with the Palestinians.Mind you, I understand the peculiar power that resides in Jerusalem. Especially when you are listening to Giora Feidman playing the ancient tunes of Safed on his incredible Klezmer clarinet. Like a lot of Americans, I have a certain feeling of rootlessness, and there are many things in Jerusalem that can fulfill them. But so can London, or perhaps a stroll on the Black Sea, or even a train trip from Los Angeles to Chicago.I would love to be just a visitor or even a resident in Jerusalem, but never an occupier. To be an occupier, you have to be a thug. Yes, I know Jerusalem is a great crossroads of civilization. I get that it's a powerful brew, but I know all my fellow Californians, whether blacks or Indonesian, Mexicans or whatever, have ancestral roots in other lands. That very fact is what gives a certain strength to living in a diaspora. Los Angeles is a diaspora for many of the world's peoples. And that is a good thing.We in Los Angeles are too politically correct to accept the rantings of people who proclaim other people cockroaches. But in Israel, there have been a disturbing number of such comments against Palestinians. They come close to calling them vermin, perhaps worthy of a genocide. A number of such voices have been published in the Israel Times and Jerusalem Post.This brought home the prophetic words of Alex Odeh, a Palestinian Catholic who was a representative of the PLO when I interviewed him in the early '80s. He was assassinated in his Orange County home, apparently by a Meir Kahane-type. I remember him sitting in my dining room, and I asked him what he would most like to tell the Jews of Los Angeles.""I would want them to know that the crux of the matter is that Palestinians are human beings, who have been subjected to a kind of Holocaust, genocide, abuse, harassment, such as Jews went through in Europe in the thirties and forties,"" he said. ""Jews in Los Angeles have a legitimate concern about the survival of Israel,but they must take into consideration the Arab or Palestinian factors,"" he said.I remember when I first visited Israel how one Israeli woman laughed off my notion when I complained Israel had not turned out to be the kind of country a gentle visionary like the great Bal Shem would have wanted ""If Jews aren't going to be the gentle and wise people of mankind, what's the point? Our greatest contributions have been in art and science,"" I said. I also argued that Jews created the very concept of messiahs -- and for the most part that was good. Otherwise, there would h ave been no Jesus, no Freud, no Marx, no Einstein.""No, she said, ""we always were a pushy, aggressive, obnoxious people. Maybe that's been the cause of anti-Semitism. And you're one of us, whether you like it or not.""Some years later, when I was back in Los Angeles, I talked about Israel with a beautiful young Sabra, a native Israeli. She said the truth was few of the younger generations were Zionists. If you sat at a coffeehouse in Tel Aviv, you'd find that most of them considered themselves Israelis rather than Zionists. And, she said, that included many younger Arab Israelis. Partly, she insisted, they see themselves as Arabs, as Palestinians, but also as Israelis.I hope it's true that time heals all wounds. --Lionel Rolfe is the author of numerous books, most of which are available in Amazon's Kindlestore."

Israel had no plans to send negotiators back to Cairo ""as long as the shooting goes on"", an Israeli official said on condition of anonymity.Medical officials in Gaza said two Palestinians were killed when their motorcycle was bombed and the bodies of three others were found beneath the rubble of one of three bombed mosques.Another attack reduced a security complex belonging to Gaza's dominant Hamas faction to a huge cloud of smoke, but there were no casualties. In other attacks, three houses were bombed, and fighter planes strafed open areas, medical officials said.The Israeli military said that since midnight it had attacked more than 30 sites in the coastal enclave, without specifying the targets.Gaza militants fired 15 rockets at towns in Israel's south on Saturday setting off alarm sirens but causing no damage or injuries, a military spokeswoman said.Since the end of a 72-hour truce on Friday, Gaza militants have fired more than 65 rockets at Israel, military officials said. Two Israelis were hurt by a mortar attack on Friday.Israeli air strikes killed five Palestinians on Friday, among them a 10-year-old boy near a mosque in Gaza City.Egypt, backed by American and European mediators, has made no visible progress toward resuming the ceasefire that had halted fighting for three days between Israel and Gaza militants that began on July 8.Egypt was expected to pursue its diplomacy on Saturday, meeting Palestinian officials in Cairo, but it wasn't clear how much progress could be made if Israeli representatives didn't show up.Both sides remain apart on terms for renewing the ceasefire, with each blaming the other for refusing to extend it.A diplomatic source familiar with the talks told Reuters it could take at least two days to see if it was possible to work out another truce. A sticking point was Israel's demand for guarantees that any reconstruction supplies sent to Gaza would not be used by Hamas to construct more tunnels of the sort that Palestinian fighters have used to infiltrate Israel.Egypt is mediating the talks but meeting separately with each party. Israel and Hamas deny each other's legitimacy, with Hamas rejecting Israel's right to exist and Israel rejecting Hamas as a terrorist organization. VIOLENCE THWARTS ANTI-WAR PROTEST PLANSCiting security concerns over continued rocket fire, Israeli police banned an anti-war protest planned for Tel Aviv on Saturday, saying regulations prohibited large gatherings in areas at risk of attack.By resuming attacks against Israel, Gaza militants appeared to be trying to ramp up pressure and making it clear they were ready to fight on to fulfill a goal of ending a blockade of the territory that both Israel and Egypt have imposed.Heavy civilian casualties and destruction during Israel's campaign against militants in packed residential areas of the Gaza Strip have raised international alarm over the past month.Gaza officials say the war has killed 1,886 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Israel says 64 of its soldiers and three civilians have died in the fighting that followed a surge in Palestinian rocket salvoes into Israel.Israel expanded its air and naval bombardment of the Gaza Strip into a ground offensive on July 17, and pulled its infantry and armor out of the enclave on Tuesday after saying it had destroyed more than 30 infiltration tunnels dug by militants.The White House urged Israel and the Palestinians to do what they could to preserve civilians after having failed to extend their ceasefire. Spokesman John Earnest said on Friday ""the United States is very concerned"" about the renewed violence.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged the parties ""not to resort to further military action that can only exacerbate the already appalling humanitarian situation in Gaza"".At a rally in South Africa, Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu accused Israel of behaving like a ""barbaric bully"" in Gaza.Israel said ahead of the truce's expiration on Friday it was ready to agree to an extension. Hamas did not agree.Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Israel had rejected most of the group's demands. The Palestinians want Israel to agree in principle to lift a Gaza blockade, release prisoners and permit the opening of a sea port.""There is no going back and the resistance will continue ... there is no retreat from any of our demands,"" Abu Zuhri said.Israel has resisted easing access to Gaza, suspecting Hamas could restock with weapons from abroad.Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, said the issue of a sea port should be part of wider peace negotiations with the Palestinians and that Hamas should not at this time be rewarded for ""using force against Israeli citizens"".In related violence, a Palestinian man died a day after being shot by Israeli troops quelling a protest in Hebron. Israeli gunfire killed another Palestinian protester in the West Bank, medical officials said.

Its decision is final and cannot be appealed, a judicial source said.The FJP's lawyer called the ruling political and said it was unconstitutional to deprive the defense of the right to appeal.""The legal reasons given do not justify this ruling but this is a political decision to get rid, not just of the Freedom and Justice Party, but of all the parties that were established after the revolution of January 25, 2011,"" lawyer Mahmoud Abou al-Aynayn told Reuters.""I expect other parties to be dissolved too.""The Muslim Brotherhood, once Egypt's oldest, best organized and most successful political movement, has seen hundreds of its members killed and thousands detained since then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi overthrew elected president and Brotherhood member Mohamed Mursi 13 months ago, following weeks of protest.Mursi, who ruled for a year, and other Brotherhood officials were rounded up in the wake of his ousting and hundreds have been sentenced to death in mass court rulings that have drawn criticism from Western governments and human rights groups.Sisi, who went on to win a presidential election in May, vowed during his campaign the Brotherhood would cease to exist under his rule. CLAMPDOWNThe FJP was established in June 2011, in the aftermath of the uprising that removed Hosni Mubarak from power after 30 years and inspired hopes for more pluralistic politics in Egypt.It went on to win parliamentary and presidential elections, but many Egyptians became disillusioned with Mursi after he gave himself sweeping powers and mismanaged the economy, taking to the streets in protest and prompting the army move against him.But the leading lights of the 2011 uprising, many of them secular youth activists, have also found themselves on the wrong side of the new political leadership, many of them receiving long sentences for breaching a new anti-protest law by taking part in small and peaceful gatherings.The government accuses the Brotherhood of inciting violence and terrorism. Egypt's state and private media now portray the Brotherhood as a terrorist group and an enemy of the state.The Brotherhood maintains it is a peaceful movement but attacks by militants have risen since the army overthrew Mursi.Most of the violence has taken place in the Sinai Peninsula near the border with Israel and the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The army has responded with air and ground attacks. (Writing by Lin Noueihed; Editing by Alison Williams and Sophie Hares)"

""I had to send banking supervisors with a suit and tie to go to the back of every branch and check whether they have enough fuel in the generators or not.""In preparation for conflict, all branches since 2007 have been forced to have generators to run the ATMs or face fines, al-Wazir said. But keeping the cash machines running depends on fuel deliveries entering the enclave every few days, he said.Given Israel's seven-year old economic blockade of the sealed-off enclave, which had already severely weakened Gaza's economy before the conflict erupted, there's no guarantees that fuel will make it in.With credit card transactions hobbled by electricity cuts, there's enough cash in Gaza, trucked in well in advance with Israeli approval, al-Wazir said. One branch has been made inoperable by Israeli bombing, but the cash survived in the safe, he said. The branch servers are located in the relative safety of the West Bank.During a humanitarian pause on July 27, it was ""a hard choice"" whether to open the branches, al-Wazir said. ""But there is a real need,"" he said. ""The economy is dead. Stores were closed.""He said he was shocked that bank staff arrived to open the branches ""because nobody believed the ceasefire."" The banks were mobbed with people desperate for cash. Salaries of Palestinian Authority workers, but not Hamas, were paid and letters of credit issued for goods to come into Gaza.""Humanitarian assistance must also go through the banking system,"" al-Wazir said. ""It is the lifeline of the economy. Gaza's survival is dependent on the banking system that's why it's so important that we opened.""He said 80,000 people crowded the branches by noon, three hours before the humanitarian pause was to end. But there was not enough time to pay everyone. ""So I called the Israeli military coordination,"" al-Wazir said. ""I told them I have at least 80,000 civilians in the streets of Gaza and they will not disperse before 3 p.m.""""They told me if they don't fire on us, we're not going to fire on them,"" he said. ""And if they fired, they would fire back."" al-Wazir also informed the U.S., the U.N. and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.The shelling started five minutes after the pause ended, he said. But the banks stayed open for three more hours and ferried people home in ambulances and taxis. ""No one was hurt, it was a miracle.,"" he said. ""It is a testament of the compassion and dedication of the bank staff to risk their lives.""On another occasion the previous week when Gaza was under fire, a branch generator malfunctioned in an open plot, next to a mosque, he said.""Israel has been targeting mosques and open plots,"" al-Wazir charged. ""This generator, which could be mistaken for a rocket launcher, was out there and who is the gutsy guy who's going to go fix it?"" He decided to leave it un-repaired and let the branch run on the two or three hours of electricity a day that Gaza is getting.Al-Wazir functions as the central bank governor of the monetary authority that was created in 1997 following the Oslo accords three years earlier that set up the Palestinian Authority.The authority is a bank regulator and sets monetary policy, but not interest rates, like other central banks. That's because the Palestinians do not have their own currency. The dollar, the Jordanian dinar and the New Israeli Shekel are accepted in Gaza and the West Bank.Plans to re-introduce the Palestinian pound, the currency under the British mandate until 1947, have been in the works under the terms of Oslo, but al-Wazir says economic conditions, even in normal times, are not yet right for it.Despite its limited function, he said his authority is fiercely independent from the PA political authorities. ""Our independence is well known to the public because when the government wanted to borrow more than we thought was fiscally responsible, we refused,"" he told me in an interview in his Ramallah office. ""That created a big crisis.""Other central bankers in Arab countries who criticize their governments are fired within a week, al-Wazir said. ""Not only did we criticize the government we stopped the banks from lending to the government,"" he said.""So I packed my bags expecting the usual. I cleaned my desk and waited for the phone call from the prime minister or from the president and the phone call never came. I thought that was a sign of real political maturity,"" he said.The authority has also showed its independence with Hamas, which is in severe economic difficulty. Because Hamas runs almost totally on cash, the closing of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt has made it difficult for suitcases of cash mostly from Qatar to get in, al-Wazir said.The authority fought off an Hamas hostile takeover attempt a couple of years ago when it tired to buy shares on the Qatar exchange of a Palestinian bank. ""It was very important to protect the banking system by enforcing a very strong firewall between us and Hamas in Gaza,"" he said.From 2007 the authority has instituted a strict anti-money-laundering policy to protect the bank's international correspondence with foreign banks under anti-terrorism laws. ""We had to shut down 6, 000 bank accounts for Hamas-affiliated guys when they tried to get into the banking system,"" al-Wazir said.The largest percentage of Palestinian transactions are dollar transactions that go through New York and are subject to the Patriot Act, al-Wazir said. ""So if you pay somebody who's on an anti-money laundering or counterterrorism list these jurisdictions will no longer deal with you.""""If you cannot send a wire transfer in dollars, you are no longer a bank,"" he said ""You become a money changer."""

For many, this brief respite provided no relief since they emerged from their shelters only to find that the places they knew no longer existed. Homes in which they were born and raised, that held within their walls memories of the lives they lived, had been reduced to rubble. Not only had lives and hope been victims of this onslaught, memories were shattered, as well.  The one-month casualty totals were staggering. At last count, 1,875 had been reported killed, 429 of whom were children. Another 9,536 had been wounded, including 2,877 children. At the peak of hostilities, more than one-quarter of all Gazans were internally displaced and of that total, 65,000 are now permanently without homes. What remains unknown are how many bodies are still buried under the rubble and how many homes, though standing, will be deemed unfit for habitation, creating an even more desperate situation in the impoverished strip called Gaza.   With or without an infusion of massive amounts of international aid, clearing away the mess of this war will take years. Streets can be cleaned, but the wounds, both physical and mental, will not soon heal, nor will the survivors easily erase the feelings of helplessness, despair and anger with which they have been left.   As Palestinians took advantage of the 72-hour calm to sift through the ruins and attempt to reconstruct their shattered lives, Israel began a clean-up operation of its own. Instead of brooms and shovels, their tools of choice were full page ads, ""studies"", and a ""setting the record straight"" press conference by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. What they attempted to clean up was not the mess they left behind in Gaza, but the damage they had done to their image world-wide.  Their relentlessness in waging war was matched by their efforts to reshape the narrative of what happened during the bloody month-long onslaught. Using misdirection and fabrication they spared no effort to provide reinforcement for their supporters and sow confusion among the public at large.   The blood of the dead had not yet dried and the bodies of the missing had not yet been recovered, when the Israelis released studies arguing that the body counts issued by a number of UN agencies operating in Gaza were wrong and, of course, biased against Israel. Based on a preliminary review of the names of what they claimed were the first 150 dead Palestinians, the Israelis concluded that one-half were, in fact, fighters. Extrapolating from that unscientific ""sample"" they advanced the facile conclusion that one-half of all the casualties must have been fighters-- this, in a brazen effort to deny the UN claim that more than 70 percent of those who died had been civilians. In the days that followed, their misdirection worked. Instead of dismissing these unscientific studies, both the Washington Post and the New York Times carried major stories about the ""disputed body counts."" Doubt had been sown.  Then, on the first day of post-cease-fire negotiations, the Prime Minister held a press conference and two pro-Israel groups placed full-page advertisements in U.S. newspapers both of which regurgitated the arguments Israel had been making since the conflict began: Israel is the moral nation; Israel is the victim; and Israel cares more for Palestinian life than Palestinians care for their own-- since it was Israel that provided warnings and even aid, food, water and electricity to the people in Gaza, while Hamas used civilians as human shields.  In his press conference, Netanyahu feigned sadness for the loss of life while placing the blame squarely on Hamas: They made us do it; they wanted to increase the number of dead, so they could use it against us; our actions were proportionate, and the justified response of a civilized victim nation fighting against evil.  By any measure, this Israeli cleanup operation was an obscene form of self-absolution designed to provide supporters with talking points, while creating confusion among all-too pliant reporters and the publics whom they impact. The purpose of this effort was to change the public's understanding of the scenes of entire neighborhoods that had been destroyed, or the entire families that had been wiped out by errant bombs, or the civilian targets that had been struck by deadly missile attacks. Instead of being seen as evidence of overwhelming and disproportionate force by a callous occupier, Israel wanted all of this to be seen as the inevitable and tragic consequence of what the very evil Hamas ""forced"" the very moral Israel to do.   There is plenty of blame to cast in Hamas' direction. They had agreed to a reconciliation government which much of the world had accepted and which provided them an escape hatch from their growing political isolation. They had the opportunity to become responsible partners with the fledgling Palestinian Authority. They knew that Israel was hell-bent on destroying this new Palestinian unity and should have known, from their earlier experience in 2006, that Israel would provoke and bait a trap for them. And yet, as before, their macho bravado and their insistence on military resistance once again led them foolishly into Israel's trap and into a fight they couldn't win. Having said this, however, nothing absolves Israel's inhumane behavior. They lied their way into this war and committed heinous crimes all throughout the month-long hostilities.  As I write, the all too brief cease-fire has ended and the pathologies of both parties are playing out again. Why Hamas thinks that this round will end any differently than the last is a mystery. Why Israel believes that it will be able to force the Palestinians to settle for humiliation and continued economic strangulation, on the other hand, is not a mystery.   After the 2008-2009 Gaza war, Israel was able to escape scot-free. Using the same clean-up tools of misdirection and fabrication, they were able to keep the U.S. solidly in their corner. When that failed, they resorted to intimidation to silence critics -- even pummeling the venerable Justice Goldstone into submission. Believing they can get away with the same game plan, Israel sees no reason to change course. As a result, Hamas also sees no point in changing its behavior, and so the sad saga will continue until there is international intervention and equal doses of justice and accountability for the misdeeds committed by all parties."

But Carrie Preston also has her hands in directing and producing through her independent film company Daisy 3 Productions. What's more, Preston shadowed True Blood director Scott Winant on the finale episode, as she is critical of the dearth of female directors in the male-dominated industry and hopes for a future as an episodic director. I had a chance to chat with Preston about her history with True Blood, winning an Emmy, women in the industry and that now-famous pool table sex scene.Will you tell me about the audition process for Arlene? How did you go about getting that part?Luckily it was a simple process for me because I had worked with Alan Ball right before they started casting the pilot. I was doing a film that he wrote and directed called Towelhead (2007), and so I met him on that, and it was while we were on Towelhead that he asked me what I was doing next. I said ""I'm not sure,"" and I asked him, and he said, ""Well, I'm doing this vampire pilot for HBO, and I might have something that you might be interested in. So they sent the script over, I read it and I honestly didn't know what character he was talking about - because it didn't appear to be that I was right for Arlene physically. I thought ""Hmm. I wonder which part he means"" And they said ""It's Arlene."" I thought, ""Well, OK. I certainly understand women like Arlene. I grew up in the south. So, I went in and had one audition with Alan and the casting directors, and they put me on tape, and he went to HBO and said, ""This is who I want for Arlene. And they said, ""OK.""So, it was the least amount of hoops I'd ever had to jump through to be a series regular on a television show. Usually they make you do many, many auditions for many, many people. I was very fortunate that it was the right fit at the right timeWow! It must be really gratifying to have someone of Ball's status trust you and appreciate your work so much as to do that ... It was highly flattering and humbling and exciting because he's someone that I've admired as a writer and a creator. I was a huge Six Feet Under fan, American Beauty fan, plus we're both from Georgia, so it was a nice southern connection as well.OK, speaking of Georgia. I notice now that your voice has a bit of a southern flare, but nothing like Arlene's. What does that voice come from? Are you imitating anyone you know in real life?I grew up in Macon, Georgia, so I know a lot of strong southern women like Arlene. I'm not doing anybody in particular because Arlene is a pretty singular person. The writers have created a very specific woman there, but I guess it's an amalgamation of women that I've known over the years and I try to honor them in the best way I can with her and feel blessed that I've gotten to play her for seven years.Speaking of Arlene and even Elsbeth, although this is a silly question, I wonder if you could tell me about their dazzling red hair. Was that from your life or commissioned by the show [True Blood]? I was born blonde and was doing roles that required me to be in the blonde world for many, many, many years and then True Blood came along, and I remained blonde for the first three seasons in a wig. The character calls for being a redhead, but I was involved with other projects at the time that we shot the pilot, so I couldn't dye my hair.And then I just decided that I was ready to move on from the wig, because the wig is limiting. There's not a lot you can do with it, and it was sometimes uncomfortable to wear a wig for upwards of 14 hours a day. So, I waited until they had a moment in the script ... a time bump that was like a year or something, and all of us changed our looks up a little bit once that happened. It was then I decided that would be a good opportunity to go wigless and dyed my hair. And I haven't looked back. It's been great.I would get in trouble with some of my friends if I didn't touch on The Good Wife, which you won an Emmy for, congratulations. I'm curious: how did you hear about your nomination?I was out walking my dog (Chumley, he's a rescue: a Maltese/poodle mix, we think ... a 7-pound adorable mutt), and I really had not known that the nominations were coming out the night before and someone sent me a text that said, ""Good luck tomorrow!"" And I was like, ""On what?"" And then like ""Oh, the nominations. Well, we'll see."" You know, I wasn't holding my breath. And then I was out walking my dog in New York, and I got a text from somebody who said ""Oh my god, I'm so proud!"" and I thought, ""OK, well that must be the nomination."" And then my publicist called and told me that I'd been nominated.And then the phone calls started coming in and it was really exciting, and I was really not expecting it when you're a guest [star]. There's hundreds and hundreds of people who are also guests, so it was pretty extraordinary to be singled out in that way and then to actually WIN was ... I already felt like I had already won.You know, when you think about it, it is really astonishing to win the guest category given that the immensity of the competition!You think about every episode of every television show that has at least one if not two or five guests in every episode. So it's a lot of people. I was pretty amazed that my peers wanted to single me out in that way.I was wondering if you could speak about the differences between the production cultures of both True Blood and The Good Wife. What's most different?On True Blood they take a lot longer to shoot an episode. It's not as prescriptive as far as shoot days at the network. The network generally on a drama will say they're shooting it in eight days, and they will usually do double up unit on a couple days and may stretch it to 10, but usually they try to keep it in the eight range.Whereas True Blood, our episodes ... it's very hard to track because everyday they're shooting two units which means there're scenes from one, two, three, sometimes four episodes at once. It's hard to tell how many days that takes, but sometimes people will do that math and it will end up taking 21 days to shoot an episode spread out over a month.So, it's very different as far as scheduling goes. Network generally tends to go from one episode to the next, so they're sequential. True Blood will juggle several at once to accommodate people's scheduling and location scheduling and all of that. I don't know how the ADs on True Blood were able to make that work - and the producers. It is a real feat that they're able to pull that off and get the episodes in the can.Since you've worked for both cable as well as network shows, I'd be curious if you've ever been a part of any conversations had with executives or if as actors you're aware of the network notes passed onto producers.The actors usually are not privy to those conversations, although for the finale of the show, True Blood, I was shadowing the director, who is one of our directors who has been with us since the beginning, Scott Winant, because I am a director as well, and so I wanted to really see what it was like from soup to nuts how our show gets made.[her dog barks] Oh, I'm sorry. He heard something out in the hall. He's very protective of me!So anyways it was very interesting for me to see how things happen on True Blood, and go into the preproduction meetings and see how many meetings go into one stunt or one scene in one location, and the care and the detail and the amount of people that are utilized to make one moment work on our show, is something that I didn't fully, fully, fully grasp and experience until I did that shadowing. It was really amazing, and I learned quite a lot about how much prep goes into a show like True Blood.Are you interested in directing for television?Yeah definitely! I love television, I love being on TV, and I love being a part of the television culture. I feel like we're in a very exciting time for television, and yet I also feel like there aren't enough women directors.I have worked with very few women directors, and I have done a lot of television. I find that disappointing, and I understand how that happens ... because [television] is a bit of a man's world. I really believe that the best person should be doing the job; I just feel like sometimes women don't get the opportunity because the decision makers are men and they probably just feel more comfortable with other men.So, is it that there's a hesitancy to even let women in the door, even when they might be the best person for the job?Television is a lot of networking and who you know. So, a lot of people are hiring people that they know, that they've already networked with, and so there's a lot of -- a bigger margin of error for women. Sometimes if a woman comes on and directs and it didn't go 100 percent right, then the assumption is that ""OK, well see, women can't do it.""So there's a smaller margin of error ... I think that scares them.At the same time I feel like I'm respected as a director and producer and actor, and I haven't felt any great amount of chauvinism thrown my way other than what you experience as a woman in the world. I would like to continue to learn more about it and hopefully be able to do some episodic directing myself. The same thing happens in our business that happens in the rest of the world.We're just having to continue to break the glass ceiling. Women are making great strides in all professions, and I hope that I can draw inspiration from them and keep doing it in mine.Were there any aspects or story lines for your character you wished had been more explored?No, I am very pleased with the evolution with Arlene. She starts off one way, and then she's a completely different woman at the end of seven years. That is what you want as an actor: a journey, an arc, someplace to go. I feel like the writers really built my character over the years, and I'm very very happy creatively with where it ended up.I wouldn't presume to come up with story lines, I really trust the writers.I just know so many people have wondered where your [character's] kids have gone.The amount of years that have passed have been fewer than the amount of years those actors have aged. I mean the little girl was seven or eight when we started, and she's 15 but in the script she's supposed to be 11 or 12. They needed to minimize that, plus they had so many parts to serve. The one character that I wonder is Mikey [Arlene and Terry's baby]. What happened to Mikey Where's Mikey!? Even when we had scenes with Coby and Lisa recently ... I tweeted ""Mikey is taking a nap"" because I don't even know where Mikey was in that situation. I think it's just a matter of casting and logistics having kids on setSo, about Sunday's episode ""May Be the Last Time."" You had a now-famous sex scene with a vampire on a pool table. I was wondering because I don't think I've seen it discussed in any great detail, the mechanics of shooting such a scene. Would you be willing to tell us what that process was like for you?We were really well taken care of by Simon Jayes who was the director of that episode. Simon was also our A-camera operator the whole run of True Blood. So, I know him really well; he's been photographing all of us for seven seasons. To have him move up into the role of director was really great, and I felt very comfortable with him. I knew that he was going to shoot it in a way that made myself and Riley [Smith] feel comfortable. That's the whole thing; that's the way they talk to youYou meet beforehand, and they talk you through it. And you talk to them about what you're comfortable doing, and you come up with a game plan, and it's like choreography. When you look at it that way, it's like doing a dance or a fight choreography. You break it down that way and it comes a lot easier because nothing is surprising. You meet ahead of time, walk through it and talk through itYou don't go through the actual actions until the cameras are there. They clear the set; only the necessary crew is there so that you don't feel like you're being watched -- self conscious in that way. There's nothing romantic about it because obviously there's people around, and you're breaking it down and doing many different angles and camera set ups. So it is something ... you know it's going to be edited together, so you just shoot it in pieces.We shot that scene and we shot the scene where we danced together on the same day. That was a 12-13 hour day. That scene had two different parts: the part where he comes into the bar and scares me, and then we had the part by the pool table. Those took eight or nine hours I would guess. Actually the part at the pool table didn't take that long because there weren't a lot of setups or a lot of angles - they didn't have to do a lot of relighting. As far as shooting goes, were there any scenes we didn't see you wished we had?But we did have one part that didn't make it in the cut that we shot on another day. I was sorry it didn't make it in the cut but it was just for time. There's a lot of stuff that the fans have no idea we do that, just for time reasons, can't make it into cut because they have to cram a lot into that 57 or 58 minutes. There was a moment where we shot the POV of vamping [having sex with a vampire]. So when he picks me up and takes me over to pool table, we shot a whole section with a green screen, and the camera's on my face, and they blew a fan on the back of my head to make my hair fly, and then the camera sees me go ""OOoohhh!!"" and start giggling. So the audience would see what it would feel like to actually be vamped. It was really fun and funny, and it was a big setup with a green screen and cameras -- a fan. I sat sort of on a stool and they shot over Riley's shoulder onto my face. It was really fun to shoot - I have photos ... they ended up not putting it in the cut but that was a whole separate day.Now that the show is wrapped, I'm curious: Did you keep anything from the set?I did keep my Merlotte's uniform, so I have that, and I have a menu from Bellefluer's. We filled out these forms to make requests for certain things from the set, and we were led to believe that we were going to get those. And then we found out that ScreenGems and Warner Bros. took everything and [I gasp]. Uh-huh!! So we were like ""Wow!, that was quick ... Screen Gems and Warner Bros. stole our set!There was a sign in the bar that said ""Homemade pies"" that the production designer had designed and they had built it and made it: homemade pies and there was a slice of pie. It just for me was something that really captured the whole Arlene taking over the bar and turning it into Bellefluer's and she had a case of pies. It felt right, and it was a real cute and looked like it was old fashioned that hung in the back of the bar. I really wanted it. I don't think the fans would even see it.Admittedly, it was pretty difficult to find.And what would you say is your experience with fans? What do they mean to you?Luckily, people love Arlene, and they like to laugh with her and they think she's funny. But they've also really appreciated all the more dramatic things that have happened to her, and they all are very supportive of her journey. So, I get a lot of really positive feedback from people out in the world and fan mail. I just experienced Comic-Con for the first time and that was wonderful to have that large crowd of people cheering for all of us. People stop traffic to yell something at me out the window, ""Arlene I LOVE YOU! So, it's been a really great experience.""(Head shot photo credit: Shawn Flint Blair).

Some know her as True Blood's sassy Southern ginger Arlene Bellefluer, while others fell in love with her as The Good Wife's deceptively ditzy Elsbeth Tascioni. But Carrie Preston also has her hands in directing and producing through her independent film company Daisy 3 Productions. What's more, Preston shadowed True Blood director Scott Winant on the finale episode, as she is critical of the dearth of female directors in the male-dominated industry and hopes for a future as an episodic director. I had a chance to chat with Preston about her history with True Blood, winning an Emmy, women in the industry and that now-famous pool table sex scene.Will you tell me about the audition process for Arlene? How did you go about getting that part?Luckily it was a simple process for me because I had worked with Alan Ball right before they started casting the pilot. I was doing a film that he wrote and directed called Towelhead (2007), and so I met him on that, and it was while we were on Towelhead that he asked me what I was doing next. I said ""I'm not sure,"" and I asked him, and he said, ""Well, I'm doing this vampire pilot for HBO, and I might have something that you might be interested in. So they sent the script over, I read it and I honestly didn't know what character he was talking about - because it didn't appear to be that I was right for Arlene physically. I thought ""Hmm. I wonder which part he means"" And they said ""It's Arlene."" I thought, ""Well, OK. I certainly understand women like Arlene. I grew up in the south. So, I went in and had one audition with Alan and the casting directors, and they put me on tape, and he went to HBO and said, ""This is who I want for Arlene. And they said, ""OK.""So, it was the least amount of hoops I'd ever had to jump through to be a series regular on a television show. Usually they make you do many, many auditions for many, many people. I was very fortunate that it was the right fit at the right timeWow! It must be really gratifying to have someone of Ball's status trust you and appreciate your work so much as to do that ... It was highly flattering and humbling and exciting because he's someone that I've admired as a writer and a creator. I was a huge Six Feet Under fan, American Beauty fan, plus we're both from Georgia, so it was a nice southern connection as well.OK, speaking of Georgia. I notice now that your voice has a bit of a southern flare, but nothing like Arlene's. What does that voice come from? Are you imitating anyone you know in real life?I grew up in Macon, Georgia, so I know a lot of strong southern women like Arlene. I'm not doing anybody in particular because Arlene is a pretty singular person. The writers have created a very specific woman there, but I guess it's an amalgamation of women that I've known over the years and I try to honor them in the best way I can with her and feel blessed that I've gotten to play her for seven years.Speaking of Arlene and even Elsbeth, although this is a silly question, I wonder if you could tell me about their dazzling red hair. Was that from your life or commissioned by the show [True Blood]? I was born blonde and was doing roles that required me to be in the blonde world for many, many, many years and then True Blood came along, and I remained blonde for the first three seasons in a wig. The character calls for being a redhead, but I was involved with other projects at the time that we shot the pilot, so I couldn't dye my hair.And then I just decided that I was ready to move on from the wig, because the wig is limiting. There's not a lot you can do with it, and it was sometimes uncomfortable to wear a wig for upwards of 14 hours a day. So, I waited until they had a moment in the script ... a time bump that was like a year or something, and all of us changed our looks up a little bit once that happened. It was then I decided that would be a good opportunity to go wigless and dyed my hair. And I haven't looked back. It's been great.I would get in trouble with some of my friends if I didn't touch on The Good Wife, which you won an Emmy for, congratulations. I'm curious: how did you hear about your nomination?I was out walking my dog (Chumley, he's a rescue: a Maltese/poodle mix, we think ... a 7-pound adorable mutt), and I really had not known that the nominations were coming out the night before and someone sent me a text that said, ""Good luck tomorrow!"" And I was like, ""On what?"" And then like ""Oh, the nominations. Well, we'll see."" You know, I wasn't holding my breath. And then I was out walking my dog in New York, and I got a text from somebody who said ""Oh my god, I'm so proud!"" and I thought, ""OK, well that must be the nomination.""

I'm curious: how did you hear about your nomination?I was out walking my dog (Chumley, he's a rescue: a Maltese/poodle mix, we think ... a 7-pound adorable mutt), and I really had not known that the nominations were coming out the night before and someone sent me a text that said, ""Good luck tomorrow!"" And I was like, ""On what?"" And then like ""Oh, the nominations. Well, we'll see."" You know, I wasn't holding my breath. And then I was out walking my dog in New York, and I got a text from somebody who said ""Oh my god, I'm so proud!"" and I thought, ""OK, well that must be the nomination."" And then my publicist called and told me that I'd been nominated.And then the phone calls started coming in and it was really exciting, and I was really not expecting it when you're a guest [star]. There's hundreds and hundreds of people who are also guests, so it was pretty extraordinary to be singled out in that way and then to actually WIN was ... I already felt like I had already won.You know, when you think about it, it is really astonishing to win the guest category given that the immensity of the competition!You think about every episode of every television show that has at least one if not two or five guests in every episode. So it's a lot of people. I was pretty amazed that my peers wanted to single me out in that way.I was wondering if you could speak about the differences between the production cultures of both True Blood and The Good Wife. What's most different?On True Blood they take a lot longer to shoot an episode. It's not as prescriptive as far as shoot days at the network. The network generally on a drama will say they're shooting it in eight days, and they will usually do double up unit on a couple days and may stretch it to 10, but usually they try to keep it in the eight range.Whereas True Blood, our episodes ... it's very hard to track because everyday they're shooting two units which means there're scenes from one, two, three, sometimes four episodes at once. It's hard to tell how many days that takes, but sometimes people will do that math and it will end up taking 21 days to shoot an episode spread out over a month.So, it's very different as far as scheduling goes. Network generally tends to go from one episode to the next, so they're sequential. True Blood will juggle several at once to accommodate people's scheduling and location scheduling and all of that. I don't know how the ADs on True Blood were able to make that work - and the producers. It is a real feat that they're able to pull that off and get the episodes in the can.Since you've worked for both cable as well as network shows, I'd be curious if you've ever been a part of any conversations had with executives or if as actors you're aware of the network notes passed onto producers.The actors usually are not privy to those conversations, although for the finale of the show, True Blood, I was shadowing the director, who is one of our directors who has been with us since the beginning, Scott Winant, because I am a director as well, and so I wanted to really see what it was like from soup to nuts how our show gets made.[her dog barks] Oh, I'm sorry. He heard something out in the hall. He's very protective of me!So anyways it was very interesting for me to see how things happen on True Blood, and go into the preproduction meetings and see how many meetings go into one stunt or one scene in one location, and the care and the detail and the amount of people that are utilized to make one moment work on our show, is something that I didn't fully, fully, fully grasp and experience until I did that shadowing. It was really amazing, and I learned quite a lot about how much prep goes into a show like True Blood.Are you interested in directing for television?Yeah definitely! I love television, I love being on TV, and I love being a part of the television culture. I feel like we're in a very exciting time for television, and yet I also feel like there aren't enough women directors.I have worked with very few women directors, and I have done a lot of television. I find that disappointing, and I understand how that happens ... because [television] is a bit of a man's world. I really believe that the best person should be doing the job; I just feel like sometimes women don't get the opportunity because the decision makers are men and they probably just feel more comfortable with other men.So, is it that there's a hesitancy to even let women in the door, even when they might be the best person for the job?Television is a lot of networking and who you know. So, a lot of people are hiring people that they know, that they've already networked with, and so there's a lot of -- a bigger margin of error for women. Sometimes if a woman comes on and directs and it didn't go 100 percent right, then the assumption is that ""OK, well see, women can't do it.""So there's a smaller margin of error ... I think that scares them.At the same time I feel like I'm respected as a director and producer and actor, and I haven't felt any great amount of chauvinism thrown my way other than what you experience as a woman in the world. I would like to continue to learn more about it and hopefully be able to do some episodic directing myself. The same thing happens in our business that happens in the rest of the world.We're just having to continue to break the glass ceiling. Women are making great strides in all professions, and I hope that I can draw inspiration from them and keep doing it in mine.Were there any aspects or story lines for your character you wished had been more explored?No, I am very pleased with the evolution with Arlene. She starts off one way, and then she's a completely different woman at the end of seven years. That is what you want as an actor: a journey, an arc, someplace to go. I feel like the writers really built my character over the years, and I'm very very happy creatively with where it ended up.I wouldn't presume to come up with story lines, I really trust the writers.I just know so many people have wondered where your [character's] kids have gone.The amount of years that have passed have been fewer than the amount of years those actors have aged. I mean the little girl was seven or eight when we started, and she's 15 but in the script she's supposed to be 11 or 12. They needed to minimize that, plus they had so many parts to serve. The one character that I wonder is Mikey [Arlene and Terry's baby]. What happened to Mikey Where's Mikey!? Even when we had scenes with Coby and Lisa recently ... I tweeted ""Mikey is taking a nap"" because I don't even know where Mikey was in that situation. I think it's just a matter of casting and logistics having kids on setSo, about Sunday's episode ""May Be the Last Time."" You had a now-famous sex scene with a vampire on a pool table. I was wondering because I don't think I've seen it discussed in any great detail, the mechanics of shooting such a scene. Would you be willing to tell us what that process was like for you?We were really well taken care of by Simon Jayes who was the director of that episode. Simon was also our A-camera operator the whole run of True Blood. So, I know him really well; he's been photographing all of us for seven seasons. To have him move up into the role of director was really great, and I felt very comfortable with him. I knew that he was going to shoot it in a way that made myself and Riley [Smith] feel comfortable. That's the whole thing; that's the way they talk to youYou meet beforehand, and they talk you through it. And you talk to them about what you're comfortable doing, and you come up with a game plan, and it's like choreography. When you look at it that way, it's like doing a dance or a fight choreography. You break it down that way and it comes a lot easier because nothing is surprising. You meet ahead of time, walk through it and talk through itYou don't go through the actual actions until the cameras are there. They clear the set; only the necessary crew is there so that you don't feel like you're being watched -- self conscious in that way. There's nothing romantic about it because obviously there's people around, and you're breaking it down and doing many different angles and camera set ups. So it is something ... you know it's going to be edited together, so you just shoot it in pieces.We shot that scene and we shot the scene where we danced together on the same day. That was a 12-13 hour day. That scene had two different parts: the part where he comes into the bar and scares me, and then we had the part by the pool table. Those took eight or nine hours I would guess. Actually the part at the pool table didn't take that long because there weren't a lot of setups or a lot of angles - they didn't have to do a lot of relighting. As far as shooting goes, were there any scenes we didn't see you wished we had?But we did have one part that didn't make it in the cut that we shot on another day. I was sorry it didn't make it in the cut but it was just for time. There's a lot of stuff that the fans have no idea we do that, just for time reasons, can't make it into cut because they have to cram a lot into that 57 or 58 minutes. There was a moment where we shot the POV of vamping [having sex with a vampire]. So when he picks me up and takes me over to pool table, we shot a whole section with a green screen, and the camera's on my face, and they blew a fan on the back of my head to make my hair fly, and then the camera sees me go ""OOoohhh!!"" and start giggling. So the audience would see what it would feel like to actually be vamped. It was really fun and funny, and it was a big setup with a green screen and cameras -- a fan. I sat sort of on a stool and they shot over Riley's shoulder onto my face. It was really fun to shoot - I have photos ... they ended up not putting it in the cut but that was a whole separate day.Now that the show is wrapped, I'm curious: Did you keep anything from the set?I did keep my Merlotte's uniform, so I have that, and I have a menu from Bellefluer's. We filled out these forms to make requests for certain things from the set, and we were led to believe that we were going to get those. And then we found out that ScreenGems and Warner Bros. took everything and [I gasp]. Uh-huh!! So we were like ""Wow!, that was quick ... Screen Gems and Warner Bros. stole our set!There was a sign in the bar that said ""Homemade pies"" that the production designer had designed and they had built it and made it: homemade pies and there was a slice of pie. It just for me was something that really captured the whole Arlene taking over the bar and turning it into Bellefluer's and she had a case of pies. It felt right, and it was a real cute and looked like it was old fashioned that hung in the back of the bar. I really wanted it. I don't think the fans would even see it.Admittedly, it was pretty difficult to find.And what would you say is your experience with fans? What do they mean to you?Luckily, people love Arlene, and they like to laugh with her and they think she's funny. But they've also really appreciated all the more dramatic things that have happened to her, and they all are very supportive of her journey. So, I get a lot of really positive feedback from people out in the world and fan mail. I just experienced Comic-Con for the first time and that was wonderful to have that large crowd of people cheering for all of us. People stop traffic to yell something at me out the window, ""Arlene I LOVE YOU! So, it's been a really great experience.""(Head shot photo credit: Shawn Flint Blair).

All weather talk is good talk as far as I am concerned. It is also human talk. Checking the forecast on multiple platforms is an American pastime, but staying around to discuss the weather on any platform is a different thing altogether.   Weather data shared in a human context is powerful and compelling; it is also hard to get right. Since 1982, The Weather Channel has been trying to strike the balance between what David Kenny, The Weather Company CEO, calls ""the four S's: safety, storytelling, science and services."" That's 32 years. That's a long time. That's a lot of shows. A lot of weather.  Frank Batten Sr., who started The Weather Channel -- and QVC -- understood the power of everyday needs and subject matter. Weather, shopping and community will always be in fashion, like marriage. But keeping them sexy day in and day out is the challenge. Photo by Marty Lederhandler / Associated PressTwitter, Instagram and Snapchat have recently cornered community engagement. Amazon and Ebay have done the same for shopping. While The Weather Channel still ""owns"" the weather, the market is ripe for disruption. The challenge of modernizing the way we consume weather information is daunting on a 24/7 scale. It may be more relentless than the weather itself. Bringing sexy back has yet to occur in this decade on the weather front, but The Weather Channel is trying: WX Geeks is a start. Yes, you heard me. Image courtesy of The Weather ChannelWX Geeks, hosted by Marshall Shepherd above, who is a former president of the American Meteorological Society, shamelessly targets a small audience of weather nuts, professionals, geeks and scientists -- aka ""the weather community."" While the weather community likes to call itself that, and I am actually part of it, I don't like the label. Weather is the domain of the people, of humanity. The weather community is really all of us. There are experts who know more about this ubiquitous subject, but everyone has something to say about it and is affected by it every day. Twitter in Super Storm Sandy demonstrated the power of collective accountability made up of the everyman or woman. The magnitude of the tornadoes recently in Colorado reminds us of our roles to report live. Simply looking up at a clear blue sky on a summer day also makes us want, even need, to connect and account.The Weather Channel President, David Clark, said on a conference call, ""We don't have high expectations for television ratings, this [WX Geeks] is really a labor of love for us."" I have a more hopeful forecast, that the everyone, the masses, might flock to WX Geeks; think Meet The Press, Face the Nation, Fashion Police, Top Chef or Monday Night Football. The cult of the niche nerd, wallowing in a tight subject verticals is very chic these days; and popular.   DirecTV accused The Weather Channel of taking the weather out of itself. Bill Cosby said, ""You don't reinvent yourselves, you get better at what you do."" Maybe weather geeks talking to one another on television will make national stars out of some of them. Maybe this new show will make the way for more engaging weather content on multiple platforms. Maybe it's the beginning of a new era that treats weather like the celebrity that it is. I say: bring it on."

AFP PHOTO/Hector RETAMAL (Photo credit should read HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb46f79240000500056141a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As some of the biggest names in the concert industry are wrapping up their summer tours or, like Garth Brooks, are getting ready to embark on a much anticipated new tour, the general public is often left wondering where all the tickets go for these popular concerts. I am sure you or someone you know have tried to buy concert tickets right when they go on sale at 10:00 a.m., only to learn the show sold out in seconds? It seems to happen all the time. The industry likes to blame these near instant sellouts on resellers and scalpers that gobbled up all of the tickets. This had led some artists and concert venues to call on policymakers to outlaw the reselling of tickets.But, now here is the real story. The reason why tickets sell out so fast, at least for many of the most popular concerts, is that only a small fraction of the seats are actually sold to the general public. Instead, many seats are reserved for credit card and fan club pre-sales, and as giveaways to the artists, promoters, venues and other VIPs. And what happens to some of those tickets? You guessed it, they're being scalped and by the artists and venues themselves. That's right, it's an inside job.   For example, in January of last year, a Justin Bieber concert in Bridgestone Arena (Tennessee) sold only 1,001 of its 13,783 seats to the general public. That's only 7 percent. Local investigative reports also discovered that some of those tickets were allocated to Bieber's management and ended up for sale on the secondary market for well above face value. In fairness, other well-known artists have been known to do the same. Following the news of Bieber scalping his own tickets, Pollstar, a concert industry publication, said ""That may not come as a surprise to anyone in the concert industry."" In addition, Katy Perry's tour rider was leaked in 2011 in which her management reserved the right to sell as many tickets as she chose directly on the secondary market. In essence, artists, concert promoters and venues are, in some cases, the scalpers. And, when the finger pointing is done, online resellers mistakenly take the blame, while consumers are completely unaware of these shenanigans. Consumers deserve honesty from artists, ticket sellers and venues about how many tickets are actually on sale. Take, for example, a retail chain that offers a rock bottom sale price for a popular laptop computer, but the sales advertisement warns ""only 20 in stock."" The warning tells shoppers that they better get there early and wait in line or don't bother. If the retail chain had not provided this warning, the advertisement could be construed as a ""bait and switch"" tactic. Comparing this retail chain example to artists that hold back the majority of concert tickets, however, does have one difference -- there are no warnings that, maybe, only 800 tickets are available to the general public. That is deceptive and should be subject to the same consumer protection laws as other retailers face. At the very least, artists and venues should announce, in advance, the number of tickets that are being sold through the fan club and other presales and how many are offered to the general public. Consumers have a right to know, particularly since many of these events are held in publicly-owned and publicly funded arenas.So why do artists and concert promoters do this? It is profitable. They hype the concert, drive up prices and, in some cases, scalp their own tickets, and some are pushing for laws to give them exclusive rights to scalp, while advocating for restrictions to prevent consumers from freely gifting or reselling purchased tickets. In short, their call to stop the scalpers is very disingenuous. I have no problem with artists and venues earning profits, but they need to be honest with fans about how many tickets are actually available for sale to the general public and they need to stop blaming resellers when fans cannot purchase tickets to their favorite events. It is just a decoy to corner the secondary market and impose a new round of fees on consumers needing to switch, gift, resell or buy purchased tickets. It's time for a little honestly in the ticket market.   Steve Pociask is president of the American Consumer Institute Center for Citizen Research, a nonprofit educational and research institute.

The hype about making ""cheap, abundant fuels with nothing but sunlight and water"" remains in spite of the reality on the ground.",2014-08-08,"TOLEDO, OHIO - AUGUST 4: Horacio Romero of Toledo, Ohio looks at algae in Lake Erie at Maumee Bay State Park August 4, 2014 in Oregon, Ohio. Toledo, Ohio area residents were once again able to drink tap water after a two day ban due to algae related toxins. (Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15bb63c000018010bcb6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While the recent shutdown of Toledo's municipal water supply due to toxic algae is in the news, it seems a good opportunity to say a word or two about the growing risks that are being taken by a biotechnology industry busy at work using genetic engineering and synthetic biology techniques to create algae that will secrete oils, fuels, chemicals and compounds for all manner of commercial and industrial uses. The potential for contamination, invasiveness, toxic algae blooms and other harms have barely been considered, and the lack of regulation is shocking. The effort to produce algae biofuels has been underway for many, many years, though you wouldn't know it given that there are still virtually none being produced at commercial scale. The hype about making ""cheap, abundant fuels with nothing but sunlight and water"" remains in spite of the reality on the ground. Microalgae (single-celled, like the cyanobacteria that caused Toledo's problem) are the focus of most research efforts because under certain circumstances, they can secrete very large amounts of oil. That can then be further refined into fuels. New approaches, including genetic engineering and synthetic biology (see resources here) are being applied to create strains that are hardy enough to withstand the rigors of cultivation, resist disease, grow prolifically, pump out more oil or or oils with certain characteristics, or event to directly secrete not just oils, but hydrocarbons and a wide range of other ""useful"" compounds. For example, companies like Joule Unlimited have developed algae to directly secrete hydrocarbons. Algenol, is developing ethanol secreting algae. Solazyme released ""Algenist"", an algae-derived (using synthetic biology?) line of anti-aging skin care products. Recently, Synthetic Genomics announced commercial release of ""Encapso"" an algae derived drilling lubricant useful for oil and gas industries. Algae are in fact viewed as a key ""tool"" for ""green"" production on many many industrial fronts. Producing liquid fuels that are competitive with petroleum remains challenging, but meanwhile, there are innumerable high end niche products that can fill the erstwhile profit-making void. While many have hailed the new algae production platforms as ""green"" industry, there are a few critics. Ecover recently launched a new synthetic algae derived ""palm oil substitute."" While environmental groups have long opposed palm oil, those paying close attention responded to Ecover's announcement requesting that Ecover reconsider, stating that while palm oil is indeed problematic, synthetically derived algae oil is no solution.The hopeful hype about how algae fuels is entirely misleading, given that algae (like corn and other crops) in fact require large amounts of nutrients to grow. Phosphorus, a nutrient introduced into Lake Eerie from farm runoff, is considered responsible for the proliferation of the algae causing problems in Toledo. They love it, require it for growth, and could not proliferate without access to it. Cultivation of algae requires lots of other inputs as well -- depending on how it is grown: For one thing, algae need lots of water and photobioreators take up a lot of space, Some have suggested cultivating them in deserts (which apparently are considered dispensable ecosystems) but of course access to water in deserts is not so easy. Algae cultivation uses a lot of energy - to keep water circulating, and for drying and extracting oils, and more. Further, algae need CO2 in order to grow. On first glance that might seem a good thing since we have overly abundant supplies of it, but in fact it is not so easy to access unless the facility is linked to the smokestack of some polluting industry. An example: Pond Biofuels in Canada is establishing a 19 million dollar ""Algal Carbon Conversion"" pilot project using emissions from a tar sands refinery. The Algae Biomass Organization (industry lobby) is promoting the idea that new EPA regulations on CO2 emissions can be addressed by linking algae production to polluting facilities. They state: ""Algae-derived commodities can turn CO2 regulation from a problem into an opportunity for emitters facing new regulations for CO2 reduction"" We need to do away with those polluting industries like tar sands extraction, not develop processes dependent on their continuation!The ""energy return"" for algae fuels still remains pathetic. By some analyses it takes seven times more energy input than is produced by the derived fuels. A 2012 review by the National Research Council concluded: the scale-up of algal biofuel production sufficient to meet at least 5 percent of U.S. demand for transportation fuels would place unsustainable demands on energy, water, and nutrients with current technologies and knowledge.""These are the reasons that we are not all driving around on algae fuels in spite of decades of hype and investment. Nonetheless policymakers seeking something to offer that sounds ""good"", as well as a weary and overwhelmed public that cannot filter through the hype and noise to make sense of algae fuels, has kept the cash cows milking and the smoke screens in place. Startup companies like Sapphire Energy, Solazyme, Algenol and Synthetic Genomics have meanwhile won large scale public investment via a long history of supports through the DOE, USDA and other agencies. They have also forged partnerships with some of the biggest corporations on earth. For example, Synthetic Genomics has a partnership with ExxonMobil to develop algae fuels as well as partnering with agriculture giant Archer Daniels Midland to produce algae derived Omega 3 DHA oils. Solazyme has partnered with Chevron, UOP, Honeywell, Unilever and Dow Chemical and is providing (very expensive) algae fuels to the U.S. Navy for their efforts to ""green"" the military and aviation industry with algae based jet fuels. They also have a partnership with industrial agriculture giants including, Bunge, in Brazil and Archer Daniels Midland, in Iowa. Saphire Energy is producing various fuels with a large commercial scale facility (long overdue and still struggling to deliver) in New Mexico. They refer to themselves as being ""at the forefront of a new green world, the intersection between synthetic biology, agriculture and energy production.""Meanwhile climate geoengineering enthusiasts are looking into stimulating algae growth using ""iron fertilization"" as a means to supposedly sequester large amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere. That scheme has been in the news most recently with a fiasco involving the CEO (Russ George) of a startup company, Planktos, attempting to evade scrutiny and international legal restrictions on iron dumping by masquerading as a ""salmon restoration project"". What does all of this have to do with Toledo? Questions about the potential for harms resulting from large scale cultivation of non-native, genetically engineered and/or synthetic algae have barely been considered. There is a remarkable lack of transparency regarding what companies are actually doing with algae. What is clear however is that the characteristics that are being engineered are largely the same characteristics that lead to invasiveness. Those include things like extreme hardiness, ability to cope with stresses, evade predators, disease resistance, prolific growth etc. that allow them to out-compete other species. It is also clear that most researchers do not consider ""containment"" to be realistic for microalgae. So, if a tank load of microalgae engineered to secrete hydrocarbons, ethanol, industrial chemicals or even just massive quantities of some sort of oil, should get dumped accidentally into Lake Eerie, and out compete native species, what then would people in Toledo be drinking? Sure, that's a worst case scenario, but claiming it is ""unlikely"" is hardly reassuring. Those are the sort of ""low probability, high consequence"" risks that we should approach with utmost precaution, especially as a warming planet is tipping the biosphere further and further out of balance. This should be on our radar given that algae are first of all very largely responsible for the oxygen we breathe, and secondly, capable of rendering our water toxic."

Why is ISIS after them, why have Sunni and Shi'a attacked them in the past, and why are they at risk of genocide now?  Yazidi on Mt. Sinjar, Iraqi/Syrian Border -- 1920'sHistorically, the Yazidis are a religious minority of the Kurds. They are said to have existed since 2000 BCE. Estimates of the number of Yazidis vary between 100,000 and 800,000, the latter being the claim of their website. According to the same site, Yazidi refugees in Germany number 30,000.Researchers believe that the Yazidi religion has elements from Zoroastrianism, Manicheism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The Yazidis call themselves Dasin, not Yazidi. The term ""Yazidism"" comes from the Persian word ""īzed"", ""angel"". The name Yazidism is connected to the 6th caliph, Yazid (680-83), who, from Shi'a point of view, is one of world history's most hated men, and is highly disliked by most Sunnis, as well. There is little evidence to show what role, if any, Yazid played in the founding or development of Yazidism. The Yazidis don't call themselves Yazidis and they're not attached to the 6th Caliph. That hasn't stopped the Sunni and Shi'a from hating them for the name they don't call themselves, as well as for the rumors that they worship the devil.What are their true beliefs?In the Yazidi -- or more correctly, Dasin -- world view, God created the world, which is now in the care of a Heptad of seven Holy Beings, often known as Angels or heft sirr (the Seven Mysteries). Preeminent among these is Melek Taus (Tawûsê Melek in Kurdish), the Peacock Angel, who is equated with Satan or Devil by some Muslims and Christians because of a similarity in a name. ""The reason for the Yazidis reputation of being devil worshipers, is connected to the other name of Melek Taus, Shaytan, the same name as the Koran's for Satan."" In the Yazidi religion, God stands above all, but only as a creator, not as a current force. Divine power is represented by Shaykh Adii, the benevolent deity and Malak Ta'us, the peacock angel who once fell into disgrace, but then repented with seven jars of tears collected over 7,000 years that were used to extinguish the fires of hell. There are six minor deities. The two listed above are the focus of their theology, which looks to heaven, but no longer believes in hell, as it is seen as a uneventful place since the fires were put out.So, not only no devil worship, they don't have a hell.The Yazidi culture has its problems in the treatment of women, honor killing, and prohibition of intermarriage. This became public after the stoning death of a Yazidi teen when she converted to Sunni Muslim to marry outside her faith. But it's not the honor killing that has led to ISIS's horrific violence toward the Yazidi, nor has it stopped others from using the misunderstanding of their religion to both isolate them political advantage as when, during the regime of Saddam Hussein, Yazidis were considered to be Arabs and maneuvered to oppose the Kurds, in order to tilt the ethnic balance in northern Iraq. The Yazidi MP in the Iraqi Parliament broke down when describing what is happening to her people (this was just before President Obama authorized air drops to the mountain).  40,000 Iraqis stranded on mountain as ISIS jihadists threaten death. Members of minority Yazidi sect face slaughter if they go down and dehydration if they stay, while 130,000 fled to Kurdish north.The Yazidi's unique identity, despite being ethnically Kurdish, was used by the Baathist regime to isolate one from the other during Saddam's reign. Both groups changed that when the Kurds became semi-autonomous and they fought together against Baathist troops in joint Peshmerga units. Since the 2003, the Kurds have recognized the Yazidi as ethnic Kurds though that didn't always help the Yazidi:  Vying for a Voice, Tribe in N. Iraq Feels Let Down:  ""We believed that Jesus Christ was coming with a force from overseas to save us,"" said the village leader, Khalil Sadoon Haji Jundu, wrapping his gold-trimmed cloak around him against the morning chill. [snip]. But more than two years later, as the Yazidis struggle for a political voice and an escape from the poverty they suffered during decades of oppression under President Saddam Hussein, tribesmen such as Jundu say they feel let down. The Yazidi were concentrated around the town of Bashika. ISIS has moved in on that area. The Yazidis that didn't make it behind Kurdish lines are stuck and dying on their historical refuge on Mt. Sinjar where they're without food, water or help. The Iraqi Kurds know the Yazidi faith is not devil worship. ISIS wants to wipe out the Yazidi in what can only be called genocide. They also want to draw out the Kurds to fight on ground to ISIS's advantage and to draw in the rest of the world for their holy war. Forty Yazidi children are reported to have died already on the mountain. This is a crisis whose response will need to be decided in hours, not days. The White House is weighing air drops of food and water, which would save some lives, and air strikes to keep ISIS off the mountain. ISIS are jihadists, they are terrorists, they shouldn't be underestimated. They have the initial goal of a caliphate from Iraq to Palestine and Turkey. The Arab League is, rightfully, terrified of them. The rest of the world has been trying to figure out how to deal with this new enemy that will not be ignored. With the Yazidi, they've come up with a way to make it impossible for the world to ignore them. France has noticed, as has the U.S. Others will follow. We're not done with Iraq yet."
30,GREEN,Cargo Ships In California Slow Down To Protect Blue Whales,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-cargo-ships-whales_n_5660585.html,,2014-08-08,"FILE - In this Aug. 14, 2008 file photo provided by Cascadia Research, a blue whale is shown near a cargo ship in the Santa Barbara Channel off the California coast. Cargo ships will be paid to slow down to avoid hitting whales and cut air pollution, under a new voluntary program being launched off California.

It comes as the season for whales in the channel peaks.Last week, a dead fin whale washed up at the beach and harbor city of Port Hueneme, south of Santa Barbara.""Slowing down ships is a good thing for air pollution, endangered species protection and human health,"" said Kristi Birney, marine conservation analyst with the Environmental Defense Center based in Santa Barbara.Six shipping companies have agreed to participate in the program, which is backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the non-profit Environmental Defense Center, said NOAA policy analyst Sean Hastings.The purpose is to combat exhaust emissions from the ships, which account for half of the ozone pollution in Santa Barbara County, and protect whales, often found washed up on the shore with blunt force trauma from collisions, Hastings said.The timing coincides with the busiest whale-feeding season in the channel, and could save lives among endangered blue whales, Hastings said.""The estimated population of blue whales in this part of the Pacific is 2,500, so every whale counts toward this population moving off the endangered species list,"" Hastings said.About 5,000 ships pass through the Santa Barbara Channel each year to the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, a 130-mile (209-km) stretch.Participating ships will be paid $2,500 for slowing to 12 knots during that part of the trip, from more typical speeds of 14 to 18 knots. A similar program targets air pollution at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.A grant from the non-profit Santa Barbara Foundation provided enough money to reward 16 slower trips, Hastings said.The $2,500 bonuses will not be enough to fully cover the lost time to shippers who slow down, said Santa Barbara Foundation community investment officer Sharyn Main, but the agencies hope the incentive will still work.""Nobody wants to hit these fabulous animals,"" said Main, adding that the program was a way to reward shippers willing to try to avoid them.
