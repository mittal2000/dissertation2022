0,TRAVEL,GoAir Flight Attendants: Airline To Employ Only Lightweight Female Flight Attendants,Emi Boscamp,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/goair-female-flight-attendants_us_5b9d4edce4b03a1dcc867d0c,Indian airline GoAir is--apparently--doing everything in its power to lighten its aircraft and improve fuel efficiency. The,2013-06-28,"Indian budget carrier 'GoAir' CEO Giorgio Di Roni (L) and managing director Jeh Wadia pose with a model of an aircraft during a press conference in Mumbai on June 16, 2011. Wadia said his company has placed an order for 72 new A320 Airbus aircraft in a deal worth up to 6.1 billion dollars at list prices. The booming Indian market has become a key source of business for France-based Airbus, which won its biggest ever order in January from GoAir's local competitor IndiGo, who ordered 180 A320s, worth 15.6 billion dollars at list prices.

Like (who else?) Ryanair before it, the airline has decided to only hire lightweight female flight attendants in the future, since males are--in general--heavier. Taking a page right out of Ryanair's playbook, the airline will also reduce the size of the in-flight magazine and the amount of water in their fleet's water tanks. The airline currently employs about 130 male flight attendants, who will not be dismissed. Yet over the next seven years, GoAir plans to induct about 80 aircraft, and the expected 2,000 future cabin recruits will be female only.But will it actually work? An unnamed former executive with an Indian legacy carrier told the First Post, ""There are umpteen number of things an airline can do to reduce weight. For example, it can reduce the weight of food and water that is carried on board, use lighter cutlery, uplift only as much fuel as is necessary depending on flight duration etc. GoAir uses Airbus 320 fleet which means it would have, on an average, four crew members per domestic flight. If even one of them is male, does it make such a huge difference to aircraft weight?”The physicial characteristics of flight staff has been a concern of airlines in many past instances, too. In August 2010, Turkish Airlines gave 28 flight attendants six months to lose weight or they'd be sacked. In March 2011, Thai Airways provided employees with required BMI and waist line measurements and told them they has six months to lose the weight. And finally, in March of this year, Nok Air released qualifications for its ideal cabin attendant on its Facebook page. She ""must have a weight in proportion with their height"" and ""must not wear dental braces,"" for example."

If you've never lived in a place with a large Persian population, or you never made friends with the Persian kids and got fed by their parents and aunts and uncles and cousins (etc. forever), it's not too late to enjoy some of the most delicious food on earth. Persian food is criminally underrepresented in America, which has probably happened for a few reasons: 1) Persian recipes get frequently and incorrectly lumped into the category of ""Arabic food."" Although Persian and Arabic cultures share similar ingredients and originate from a similar part of the world, they are very much not the same. (Which is also not to mention the fact that there is no ""Arabia,"" but that is another conversation for another day.) 2) Because U.S. relations with Iran are frequently less than perfect, we haven't had as flowing a cultural exchange as we have with a lot of other countries' cuisines. That is a bummer for a lot of reasons, but the reasons we are concerned with today are as follows: proper use of pomegranate juice, cardamom, rosewater, pistachios and saffron. Delicious things we should be cooking with more. Persian recipes include a lot of ingredients and techniques that we're already familiar with -- steamed basmati rice, long-braised chicken dishes, kebabs, yogurt marinades. We've tried to represent some of the most tried and true Persian comfort food classics here, as introduced to us by our friends and their families. Like the other cultural cuisines we adore, the Persian kitchen is marked with a constant desire to feed the people you love, whether they are hungry or not.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?
