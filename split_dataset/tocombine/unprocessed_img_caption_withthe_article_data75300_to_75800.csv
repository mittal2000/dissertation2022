0,POLITICS,GOP Presidential Field Split Apart By 9/11,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/911-gop-race_us_56239d03e4b02f6a900ca1d8,"Ben Carson had a plan for stopping the war in Afghanistan, and Donald Trump thinks he could have prevented 9/11.",2015-10-18,Republican presidential candidates are divided on 9/11.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_147_162_3426_1595%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Fourteen years later, the 9/11 terrorist attacks have become a major issue in the GOP presidential race, dividing the candidates on who was responsible and what should have been done.On Sunday, Donald Trump continued to hammer former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for repeatedly saying that his brother, former President George W. Bush, ""kept us safe."" ""Jeb said, 'We were safe with my brother. We were safe.' Well, the World Trade Center just fell down,"" Trump said in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Now, am I trying to blame him? I'm not blaming anybody. But the World Trade Center came down. When he said we were safe, that's not safe. We lost 3,000 people. It was one of the greatest -- probably the greatest catastrophe in this country.""When Bush allies talk about the former president's national security legacy, they tend to stress what happened after 9/11, even though the terrorist attacks also happened during his presidency.""As it relates to my brother, there's one thing I know for sure: He kept us safe,"" Jeb Bush said during last month's debate. ""I don't know if you remember, Donald -- you remember the rubble? You remember the firefighter with his arms around him? He sent a clear signal that the United States would be strong and fight Islamic terrorism, and he did keep us safe.""Others have pointed out that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the response to Hurricane Katrina, also did not keep the country safe. Bush reiterated his defense Sunday morning during an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union.""""I don't know why he keeps bringing this up,"" Bush said, referring to Trump. ""It doesn't show that he's a serious person as it relates to being commander in chief and being the architect of a foreign policy.""""I mean, so next week, Mr. Trump is probably going to say that FDR was around when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. It's what you do after that matters,"" he added. ""And that's the sign of leadership. You don't have to have your last name named Bush to be able to understand that.""Trump also implied Sunday that if he had been president in 2001, the 9/11 attacks may not have even happened because he would have been tougher on ""illegal immigration.""""So there's a good chance that those people would not have been in our country,"" Trump said, reiterating that he wasn't blaming former President Bush for the attacks.Jeb Bush's presidential campaign is now fundraising off of Trump's comments.Ben Carson declined to jump into the debate on whether Bush is to blame for 9/11 during an interview Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" but he said he did not think going to war in Iraq and Afghanistan was a good idea. Carson repeated his belief that if former President Bush had just declared the United States to be energy independent, the war in Afghanistan would have been unnecessary.""So you're standing by the statement that had President Bush simply declared energy independence back after 9/11, that would have caused the moderate Arab governments to turn over Osama bin Laden?"" host George Stephanopoulos asked. ""I think [Afghanistan] would have been extremely concerned about what the ramifications of that would have been. And I believe they would have been considerably more cooperative,"" Carson said.More from that exchange:STEPHANOPOULOS: How would they have gotten him out of the tribal areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan?Meanwhile, nearly all the GOP presidential candidates are unable to decide if they support new legislation to aid Sept. 11 responders."

3,THE WORLDPOST,Violence Escalates In Jerusalem And West Bank,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerusalem-west-bank-stabbing_us_5623b621e4b02f6a900ca4d7,Many fear a third intifada is on its way.,2015-10-18,"Palestinian students hold a knife during an anti-Israel protest in the city of Khan Yunis in the Southern Gaza Strip, Oct. 18, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5623b9bf1400002b003c87c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Violence in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem showed no sign of abating as stabbings and violent protests continued throughout the weekend. Since Friday, seven Palestinians and two Israelis have died and several were severely injured, reported Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post.Here are the latest developments as leaders scramble to deal with the growing crisis.""Thwarted knife attacks"" led to nine deaths and caused many more injuriesOn Saturday, a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli border patrol officer at the Qalandia crossing in the West Bank, Reuters reported. He then wielded a second knife and attempted to stab a second policeman. The alleged attacker was shot and killed.Two Palestinians attempted to harm more Israeli border police in East Jerusalem later that day. They were both shot dead.In Hebron, an Israeli civilian shot and killed an 18-year-old Palestinian, identified as Fadel Mohammed al Qawasameh, according to Haaretz. The shooter claimed Qawasameh was trying to stab him, a claim Palestinian officials said was dubious.Two more Palestinians attempted stabbings and were shot dead by Israeli police in Hebron over the weekend, Haaretz reported. One more Israeli and his attacker died in an attack on a bus station in BeershebaOn Sunday evening, an Arab assailant shot at people in Beersheba's central bus station, killing one Israeli soldier and wounding 10 police and civilians, according to The Associated Press. The man walked in with a knife and gun and started ""shooting and stabbing people."" Security then killed him.An Eritrean man with no connection to the alleged assailant was mistakenly shot by security personnel and beaten up by a mob, the Jerusalem Post said. Israelis congregated outside of the bus station Sunday night, chanting ""death to Arabs.""While most incidents in the past few days have been directed at members of Israeli police and border patrol, this shooting occurred in a crowded space, placing a higher number of people at risk.These incidents bring up the death toll from street violence to more than 40 Palestinians and eight Israelis in recent weeks.Social media played a major role in the stabbing streakUnlike past outbreaks of violence between Israelis and Palestinians, this recent uptick has been driven by knife attacks. The perpetrators are described as leaderless young people fueled by social media -- the term “knife intifada” has even appeared online.""You don’t need something sophisticated. We’re talking about 15-year-old boys,"" Orit Perlov, an analyst of Arab social media at the Institute for National Security Studies, told The New York Times. ""You just write the word ‘it’an,’ stab in Arabic, and then whoever has a knife in his house and wants to go, that’s it.”Many Palestinians are angered by what they perceive as Israeli brutality. ""They are smart and clever,"" one stabber's relative told The Guardian. ""They can’t sustain the humiliation. They think: if you are going to kill us in the end, we should attack first.""Those who stab Israelis and then get killed are glorified; it's another type of suicide attack, Daniel Nisman, president of the Levantine Group, an Israeli security analysis firm, told the Times.Israel moved forward with major security measuresFour Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, voted Sunday to temporarily ban all Arab workers from their schools.“Entrance to cleaning and maintenance workers will be forbidden during school hours,” the Hod Hasharon municipality wrote on its website.Israel's Education Ministry has yet to comment, but the Interior Ministry released a statement calling for municipalities to “continue to act with respect and equality towards all their workers, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or gender.”Israeli police were also granted greater stop-and-frisk powers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Sunday that these measures were about ""preserving the status quo, we will continue to do so.""Israeli security has found it difficult to prevent stabbings due to the unpredictable nature of the attacks, whose perpetrators act as lone wolves. ""Palestinians who carry out attacks are no longer scared of the security forces,"" Lior Akerman, a former Israeli brigadier general, wrote in the Jerusalem Post. Kerry announced he would meet with Netanyahu and AbbasU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry plans to meet with Netanyahu in Germany this week and then will travel to the Middle East for a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. The tone of the meeting with Abbas will be set by how Kerry's conversation with Netanyahu unfolds, a senior Abbas official told Haaretz.Kerry played the role of mediator during lengthy peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestianians that collapsed in 2014.The prospects for peace have grown increasingly bleak. Abbas told the United Nations General Assembly last month that he will no longer be bound by the 1993 Oslo accords, the de facto framework for peace talks.Whether Kerry will preside over a renewed push for a two-state solution is unclear.Palestinians set fire to a Jewish shrineThe tomb of biblical patriarch Joseph, a Jewish holy site in the Palestinian city of Nablus, went up in flames Friday when about 100 Palestinian attackers set fire to the shrine. Over Saturday night, five Jewish worshippers entered the shrine and became involved in a confrontation with Palestinian police. Soldiers from the Israeli Defense Forces found the worshippers badly bruised afterwards.For the first time in this spate of violence, Abbas explicitly condemned an attack on Palestinian soil. He ""decided to immediately form an investigative commission to probe this irresponsible act committed this morning, and [to] repair the damage to the site caused by these deplorable actions,"" he told the Times of Israel. In the face of Israeli accusations of having incited the violence in the West Bank, Abbas has tried to tamp down bellicose rhetoric. He stated that he sought to avoid confrontation with Israel -- ""we are telling our security forces, our political movements, that we do not want an escalation but that we want to protect ourselves.""Pope Francis counseled, ""Say no to hatred and revenge""The Holy Father is yet again speaking out against the violence. On Sunday, he said the region needed ""much courage and much strength of spirit to say no to hatred and revenge.""The pope has been a major advocate for Israeli-Palestinian peace in the past. The Vatican officially recognized Palestinian statehood in May in the form of a bilateral treaty, but has also said that not recognizing the state of Israel is an act of anti-Semitism.Hezbollah leader praised the ""renewed intifada""The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah group announced his support for the Palestinian attacks on Israelis on Sunday. ""It is everyone's responsibility to stand by it and help it, each with their own capabilities, abilities and circumstances,"" he said during a broadcast.The Israeli government has been at odds with Hezbollah for years. In 2006, Israel attempted to knock out Hezbollah troops in Lebanon, leading to a 33-day war that caused 119 Israeli and more than 1,000 Lebanese deaths.New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio visited Israel, called for end to violenceNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, on a solidarity trip to Israel, met with the mayors of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on Saturday and also visited stabbing victims. He called off his visit to the West Bank due to security concerns.He said on Sunday that the street violence is ""unconscionable and unacceptable according to all our values and it is something that must end."""
4,THE WORLDPOST,"Israelis, Palestinians Protest Causes Of Violence In Jerusalem",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israelis-palestinians-protest-violence_us_5622cd86e4b08589ef47b721,"Some 1,500 activists gathered to say the Israeli occupation must end.",2015-10-18,"Israeli and Palestinian activists hold a banner that says ""Stopping Racism"" in Hebrew and Arabic. Some 2,000 people demonstrated for peace in Jerusalem on Saturday, Oct. 17.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5622d1571400002b003c87b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some 1,500 Israelis and Palestinians attended a rally for coexistence and equality in downtown Jerusalem Saturday night.The demonstrators called for an end to the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, which they believe is a root cause of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian violence that reignited earlier this month. Many held signs saying “Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies” and chanted peace slogans that rhyme in Hebrew, such as ""Money for the neighborhoods / Not for the settlements."" Noa Levy, 30, a human rights lawyer and activist with Hadash, a radical Jewish-Arab political party, came from the Israeli city of Jaffa to attend the event.“We are calling for an end to the occupation and to racism and to remind our fellow Israelis that there is an alternative situation,” Levy said. “We can live in peace and understanding.”“Occupation and colonialism has ended all around the world. Israel is the place where occupation is still going on,” she added. “We want to live in this place, we are patriots and we want to live in it peacefully together.”Levy said that the curfew imposed on Palestinian East Jerusalem had limited the number of Palestinian attendees, but she knew of at least one bus of Palestinian citizens of Israel from the north of the country who came to participate. Since the beginning of October, seven Israelis have been killed in a series of attacks by Palestinians, many of them teenagers using knives or other crude objects. At least 36 Palestinians have been killed over the same period, according to The New York Times, including some 16 suspected attackers shot by Israelis and 20 other Palestinians killed during confrontations with Israeli security forces. The Israeli human rights group B’Tselem has questioned the necessity of killing some alleged Palestinian assailants, who they say were no longer dangerous when they were shot.The latest round of violence began when Israel restricted Palestinian access to the Al Aqsa Mosque for what it said were security reasons. That prompted Palestinian fears that Israel was attempting to change the current agreement prohibiting Jewish prayer on the hallowed site, which is considered sacred by Jews and Muslims alike. The Israeli government denies those claims.The government has responded to the wave of violence, primarily centered in Jerusalem, by implementing checkpoints and curfews in Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and increasing the presence of security forces of all kinds throughout the city.Saturday’s demonstration is part of a new campaign called ""Standing Together"" run by a broad array of left-leaning political parties and civil society groups to promote Israeli-Palestinian coexistence. The organizers decry Israeli government policies they say are escalating violence while failing to address its underlying causes. They are planning similar gatherings in Haifa, Tel Aviv and other cities in the coming weeks.Israeli Knesset members from Meretz, a progressive Zionist party, and leaders of the advocacy group Peace Now joined more radical activists at the Jerusalem demonstration, according to reports. Meretz party leader Zehava Galon used her speech at the rally to demand that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accept a French proposal in the U.N. Security Council to send international observers to the Temple Mount, an area in Jerusalem's Old City that includes the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, Haaretz reported.""At a time of unceasing and explosive tension when the national dispute is about to become a religious conflict, the government needs to take steps and back international initiatives to restore quiet and enable a calming of passions in advance of dialogue,"" she said.The participating groups are normally divided on questions like the Jewish character of Israel, but given the circumstances, they have bridged those differences to promote their shared goals, Levy said.“We all respect the Palestinians’ right to independence,” she said. “In the current situation, this what is important.”Also on HuffPost:"

And though the country -- one of two communist nations in Southeast Asia -- abolished a ban on same-sex marriage earlier this year, gay couples are neither recognized nor protected by law.Lương Thế Huy, the LGBT rights program manager at Vietnam’s Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment (iSEE), tells The Huffington Post that overcoming rigid family attitudes remains one of the greatest obstacles facing Vietnam's LGBT community.“Because of traditional norms -- such as keeping the family line intact, saving face, etc. -- there is a lot of stigma and misunderstanding,” he says. “Many people also think that LGBT people are ‘social evils,’ or that it is ‘fashion’ or ‘social trend.’ [As a result] most LGBT people still hide their sexuality from their parents.” When iSEE surveyed 3,000 gay, lesbian and transgender people in Vietnam in 2008, 20 percent of respondents said they had been beaten by family members.“My father beat me, saying, 'I don’t accept a homo in my house. You were born a real boy, I care for you like the rest of them, why do you do this to me?'” one child told the organization in 2012.Another survey conducted by iSEE in 2009 found that a majority of gays and lesbians in Vietnam choose to keep their sexual identity hidden for fear of social repercussions. Only 2.5 percent of gay men said they had come out “completely,” and 5 percent said they were “mostly open.” The group has also found that public perceptions of LGBT people are largely negative in the country. About a third of respondents to the 2009 iSEE survey said that homosexuality is an “illness or contagion,” while 54 percent said that it is “due to a lack of parental care/love/guidance.” Half of all respondents said LGBT people “can be cured.” Some LGBT children reportedly run away from home because of the abuse they face. Most of these children turn to sex work to make a living, according to a 2012 study conducted by iSEE in collaboration with Save the Children.That year, Tran Lan Anh, a teenage sex worker, told Viet Nam News that she had turned to the sex trade as a last resort after running away from home at the age of 13. She said she left home after enduring daily beatings and verbal abuse from her parents who condemned “her lesbian relationship.”She recalled that later, when she applied for “manual jobs, the employers refused to hire me and used impolite words, reasoning that because I am not a normal person, I will steal their money.” Discrimination of LGBT people is not only common in the home and in the workplace, but also in schools, according to a 2014 USAID/UNDP report on LGBT rights in Vietnam. “Surveys report high levels of physical violence, sexual harassment and verbal abuse” in educational environments, the report said. “The result is that LGBT people do not feel safe. They experience violence, drop out of school and have suicidal thoughts.”A lack of LGBT-friendly health care facilities and services is another major issue for the community, as are the discriminatory attitudes of medical practitioners.In 2011, Thanh Nien News quoted an officer at Hanoi Community Health Care clinic as saying that “sex between a man and a woman is normal but sex between two men or two women is not normal.”“I think it’s something sick,” the unnamed officer added. For the transgender community in Vietnam, another health care challenge is limited access to gender confirmation surgery options and hormone treatments.Transgender people are also currently unable to legally change their gender designation, and may also encounter difficulties when trying to change their names on official documents.Homosexuality, however, is not criminalized in Vietnam, and LGBT persons can serve in the military. Conversations about marriage equality and protections for LGBT people have begun at the government level. In recent years, the country has also hosted annual Pride events. Last year, activists celebrated a big win when Vietnam accepted the UN Human Rights Council’s recommendation to enact anti-discrimination laws to guarantee the equality of all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity.Such legislation, however, remains purely theoretical.Vietnam, which has been led by the communist party since reunification in 1975, is currently undergoing major legal reform, with many important laws slated for amendment. Huy says activists are now focused on pushing for the improvement and addition of laws pertaining to LGBT people, and also for greater awareness about LGBT issues.“Sexuality education in public schools is one of the most challenging areas that we are trying to work on now,” he says. “The future is in the hands of the next generation. They need to have correct knowledge and be taught to be tolerant with diversity.”The challenges facing activists, however, are immense. The human rights situation in Vietnam remains “critical,” because of a general lack of basic freedoms for citizens and endemic official corruption, according to Human Rights Watch. “The education curriculum is the same for all schools in Vietnam, even for private schools, and it’s controlled by the government. Trying to add sexuality education to the formal program is difficult and needs to be advocated for from the highest level,” Huy says.“More public awareness about LGBT issues is also needed,” he adds. “We have a lot of things to advocate for when it comes to LGBT rights.” Also on HuffPost: "

They are human rights that should be enjoyed by all.",2015-10-18,2015-10-18-1445141165-3842910-nyt_101815_450900x592.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-10-18-1445141165-3842910-nyt_101815_450900x592-thumb.jpg,"It has been said that racism is America's original sin. And today, well into our country's third century, we are far from free of it. ""Separate but equal"" is no longer the law of the land, but for too many people, it is still a fact of life. African-Americans are disproportionately affected by poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. Black households have less than one-tenth the wealth of white households, on average. Millions of black, brown and poor children are relegated to under-resourced, struggling schools. People of color comprise about 30 percent of the United States' population but account for 60 percent of those in prison. Not since Reconstruction have there been as many attempts to restrict the right to vote. And the presidential race is chock full of ""dog-whistle politics."" Republican front-runner Donald Trump has called for mass deportations of millions of immigrants. He has described immigrants from Mexico as ""criminals"" and ""rapists."" And his view of the Black Lives Matter movement: ""They're looking for trouble."" Trump is not alone; his incendiary views merely have stolen the spotlight from other candidates in his party who also play to anger, frustration and hate. America is far from the post-racial society we hoped President Obama's election would usher in. In some ways, it is even more polarized. As Jitu Brown of the Journey for Justice Alliance has said, ""You can't change reality unless you're willing to face it."" The reality that we have to face, and change, is that we live in a society in which black lives have been demeaned and devalued. And face it we must. As a woman, as a Jew, as a lesbian and as a labor leader in a time of great anti-union animus, I have had my share of biases projected on me. But it is nothing like the experience of people of color, and especially black and brown men and boys. Those of us who aren't regularly subject to outright prejudice have a moral obligation to do the hard and perhaps uncomfortable work of digging into unconscious and semiconscious behaviors and attitudes about race. And that includes taking a look at our own privilege. White Americans can go a long time without ever thinking about the color of their skin. Black and brown Americans have no choice but to confront issues of race every day. Most white Americans haven't had to -- and, honestly, haven't wanted to -- confront these realities. But we must.The presumption of innocence, the benefit of the doubt, walking without worrying -- these should not be hallmarks of white privilege. They are human rights that should be enjoyed by all. How can we move forward if those of us who have enjoyed privilege our whole lives don't at least try to understand the reality of those who have not, and try to address it? We must call out hate and hostility and honor the humanity of all people.My union, the American Federation of Teachers, is trying. Last week, the AFT's Racial Equity Task Force issued ""Reclaiming the Promise of Racial Equity: In Education, Economics and Our Criminal Justice System."" The report offers concrete steps to create safe, welcoming and excellent public schools where parents want to send their children, where students -- particularly boys of color -- are engaged, and where educators want to work. It focuses on ways to end the institutional racism that pervades our criminal justice system, perpetuates economic adversity and drives school discipline policies that have led to disproportionate suspensions and expulsions of students of color -- as early as kindergarten in some charter schools -- and have failed to make schools safer.But we know it is not enough to issue reports, or seek legislative remedies, or march for civil rights or contribute to groups advancing social justice. We have to confront prejudice whenever we see or hear it, and grapple with our own biases and behaviors. We have started this process of talking about race in our union. It has been tough and emotional, but it is absolutely necessary to ensure that black lives matter.There is a saying from the Talmud: ""Silence is akin to consent."" The everyday indignities and constant fear that so many people live with are unacceptable. The devaluing of the lives of people of color is horrific. We must call out the hate and hostility that play to fears and frustrations, and we must honor the humanity of all people. We like to believe that, faced with challenges or even simple choices, the way forward for people of conscience will be the righteous path, the moral road, the just route. We have at times stumbled on this journey, but we must get up, band together and do the hard work -- within ourselves and throughout our world -- of overcoming obstacles to reclaim the promise of a better America for all."

But when Smith clicked on American Airlines' website to check on his in-flight meal, he discovered he was going nowhere.Despite the sophisticated technology used in today's reservation systems -- or maybe because of it -- data goes missing from time to time. Fortunately, there are ways to recover your reservation and salvage your trip.Smith was temporarily working in Utah and commuting to Washington, D.C., and the business class tickets were for a getaway with his wife. Oddly, one leg of his flight, from Dallas to San Juan, had been canceled.American offered to re-book Smith on his original Dallas-to-San Juan flight in economy class, but he wanted his original class of service. The airline also offered an alternative flight in business class, but it would have arrived in San Juan too late in the evening for his preference, and Smith turned that down as well.""A representative told me that she would have to kick it up the chain,"" he says. A few days later, American restored his itinerary.What happened? American says the glitch is unrelated to its recent merger with US Airways and that it would investigate the partially lost reservation. Perhaps it's just as well; when things go wrong, travelers almost never find out why, but, in fairness, they almost never ask as long as the problem is solved.Smith's reservation wasn't an easy fix. His airline continued to insist that he accept an economy class ticket or a new, less convenient schedule. Smith says he was patient and persistent, which may be the first rules of finding a missing reservation. Smith also remained polite, even when it appeared his Puerto Rico vacation would be less than perfect. It's a strategy that paid off.What are the chances your next reservation will get lost? If you're flying, Smith's problem is one in a million, says Elizabeth Blount, president of Uniglobe Travel Designers, a travel management company. She's never had an airline lose a reservation, she says. ""Car rentals and hotels have lost reservations a handful of times for me.""The problem is declining as travel companies upgrade their systems. But it's far from extinct, and it probably never will be. The reason: human error.Mike Danish says he recently lost a car rental reservation made online through CarRentals.com. The cause is unclear.""When I got to the Dollar counter in the airport in Seattle, I was told there was no reservation,"" he says. According to Dollar's records, Danish had made two reservations for a different date. The error came at a cost: Instead of paying $26 a day for the rental, Dollar billed him a walk-up rate of $48.Danish, an electronics repair consultant based in Aberdeen, Md., isn't sure whether he pushed a wrong button or whether CarRentals.com booked the wrong day. But if it was his mistake, he wonders why the system didn't catch an impossible pick-up or drop-off date.One of the most common lost-reservation cases used to involve hotels, particularly rooms booked at the last minute. The reason was largely technical. As recently as a decade ago, many hotels used fax machines to handle reservations -- and fax machines can run out of paper. ""The technology and products for last-minute bookings have come a long way,"" says Leslie Cafferty, a spokeswoman for the Priceline Group, which owns Priceline and Booking.com.A few simple precautions can ensure that your trip isn't ruined by lost reservations.Smith's strategy is among the best. ""It's never a bad idea to contact a company 24 hours prior to the trip,"" says Ben Hamilton, the president of ImagineAir, an on-demand plane service. ""If there is a problem, you will have time to correct it.""Even if you don't remember to call ahead, you can still save an AWOL reservation by packing a hard copy of your confirmation. Nothing jogs a general manager's memory like a printout.If you're inconvenienced by a lost reservation, you can ask for reasonable accommodations, Hamilton says. ""There may be a policy in place to award a credit, upgrade or free room altogether,"" he says. For example, at ImagineAir, if an important detail in a reservation is flubbed by humans or technology, your flight is free.""Everyone understands that mistakes are made,"" he adds, ""but it's how they are handled that often makes the difference between earning new customer loyalty stemming from a lost reservation, or ensuring that the customer never comes back.""And that may be your most effective tool for finding a lost reservation. Politely remind your airline, car rental company, cruise line or hotel that it has a reputation to uphold. That should be all it takes to help it locate your ticket, car or cabin.After you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google. I also have a newsletter and you'll definitely want to order my new, amazingly helpful and subversive book called How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle).

It can stereotype but it can also humanize. It can fuel war propaganda but it can also provide glimpses of hope for peace. It can rationalize espionage and torture, but it can promote human rights and human dignity.  Rock the Kasbah, a film starring Bill Murray as a talent manager in Afghanistan, gives us hope that Hollywood is going beyond the stereotypes of Islam. Barry Levinson's film can be a turning point for the image of Muslims on the silver screen, one of change for the better, moving away from the depiction of sex-craved, blood-thirsty and cruel caricatures.Yes there is the warlord character in the film, but the key leader is heard loud and clear that he wishes to pray for peace and not pay for more bullets. Yes there is a convulsion in response to an Afghan woman named Salima singing in public, but Afghan society embraces her. Salima says she must pursue singing since it is a gift from God. Yes there is hypocrisy of men using Islam to impose puritanical shackles on women while living lavish lifestyles in mansions littered with whores, but that is the truth.Amidst the corruption, we find humanity rising from the rubble and liberated from the oppression. We find humanity of the Afghan people and the beauty of Afghan culture as the contradictions illustrated in the film manifest themselves with heroes changing the status quo -- an American talent manager and an Afghan woman singer, along with the courage of the host of Afghan Star, similar to American Idol, to go ahead with the show featuring a woman singer. The humanization of the Afghan people unfolds throughout the film and it climaxes with Salima singing ""Peace Train"" by Cat Stevens, whose serene songs are woven throughout the story, and Afghan audiences smiling and laughing and finding tranquility.What is hopeful is that people walk out with an appreciation for the complexity of any foreign culture and within any religion, as well as separating human aberration from religious principles. What is inspiring is that the filmmakers made an effort to give space in the production for these positive images. Future filmmakers should not settle for caricatures but rather show the human faces of Muslims throughout the world and build bridges of human relations between the American people and the Muslim peoples.I hosted a screening of Rock the Kasbah and had the privilege of interviewing an actor in the film, Faheem Fazli who played the father of Salima. He said this was the first time in his 25-year acting career that he didn't have to play a terrorist. He also mentioned his 16-year-old daughter who has the opportunity to fulfill her dreams, to become a singer or whatever she wants to do. That's what this film represents to many -- a dream. Hollywood is good at instilling a dream in all of us to find the truth and give opportunity to the oppressed. Afghans have suffered and survived so much difficulty, and it came through in Salima's personal story of triumph. For that precious jewel in a backdrop of darkness, we as Muslims must applaud such an endeavor and engage in partnership."
14,POLITICS,Justice Breyer Won't Sit Out Big Energy Case Where He Had Conflict Of Interest,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-breyer-conflict-of-interest_us_562134eee4b08589ef472dd8,"A Bloomberg reporter blew the lid on the inadvertent conflict, which led to Breyer's wife selling off about $33,000 worth of stock.",2015-10-17,U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer became aware of his conflict of interest in a recent case after a Bloomberg reporter's inquiry.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5622214012000026007e5592.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Under federal law, a Supreme Court justice must recuse from a case when he or his spouse have a ""financial interest"" in it. Justice Stephen Breyer didn't know his wife held stock in a company with a stake in a big energy case the court heard on Wednesday, and apparently neither did she. When he learned about it following a reporter's inquiry, she immediately got rid of it.Late on Thursday, Bloomberg reported Breyer's wife, Joanna, sold about $33,000 worth of stock in Johnson Controls Inc., a company with a stake in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Electric Power Supply Association, a case the court heard on Wednesday testing the validity of a federal rule energy groups are challenging as ""arbitrary and capricious.""A Supreme Court spokesperson confirmed Breyer took action with respect to the stock once Greg Stohr, a Bloomberg reporter, inquired about it following the hearing.In a Thursday letter to the lawyers for the numerous parties in the case, the court's clerk, Scott Harris, said that Breyer's wife sold 750 shares of Johnson Controls Inc. -- owner of EnergyConnect Inc., a party in the case -- that same day, noting that the ""ordinary conflict-check"" the justice's staff conducts ahead of considering a case ""inadvertently failed to find this potential conflict.""Citing the judicial ethics canon federal judges should follow in the event of a potential disqualification, Harris said Breyer's wife went on to sell her entire interest in Johnson Controls, and that the justice decided he would remain on the case. Johnson Controls' EnergyConnect supports the federal rule at issue in the dispute. ""Justice Breyer has devoted substantial judicial time to this case,"" Harris wrote. ""He has no reason to believe that the financial interest could be substantially affected by the outcome of the case.""Curiously, another justice, Samuel Alito, did sit out the energy case and was not present at the Wednesday hearing, probably due to a similar conflict. He recused in May, when the Supreme Court first agreed to hear the case, but didn't indicate why he did so.Gabe Roth, the executive director of Fix the Court, a nonprofit that aims to bring more transparency and accountability to the Supreme Court, noted Alito's latest financial disclosure form indicates he also owns stock in Johnson Controls, and lamented his absence from the case.""It is deeply unsettling that Justice Alito’s ownership of a few thousand dollars in energy stock could yield a 4-4 tie in [a] case about regulating the many-billion-dollar energy market,"" Roth said in a statement. ""Alito’s recusal underscores the need for justices to get rid of their shares in individual companies or instead place their shares into blind trusts for the duration of their tenure.""If the court were to split 4-4 in the case, which is possible given the liberal-conservative divide among the justices, its decision would have no binding effect, and the ruling from the federal appeals court that struck the rule at issue would control.Justice Anthony Kennedy once told a congressional panel that those ties ""'mean that everybody's time is wasted.""That ought to worry the Obama administration, which on Wednesday defended the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to adopt an agency rule that allows for financial incentives to major energy consumers for ""demand response"" -- or the coordinated reduction in power consumption in tandem with price fluctuations. Trade publications and the energy industry are closely following the case.For court watchers like Roth, the Breyer and Alito situations reveal the lack of uniformity on how the court deals with recusals.""There's no communications between the justices on this,"" he told The Huffington Post. ""Each has their own set of practices as to how they determine conflicts."" Roth said Alito could have alerted the other justices with holdings in public companies about the potential for problems. The FERC case won't be the last time there'll be an empty chair inside the Supreme Court.In December, Justice Elena Kagan is expected to sit out the oral arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas, a case that may further narrow -- and maybe even do away with -- affirmative action programs at public universities. She was involved in the early stages of the case while serving as solicitor general for President Barack Obama. "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) declined to accept a maximum campaign donation from the CEO of a company that increased the price of a drug used by HIV and AIDS patients by hundreds of dollars, choosing instead to donate the money to a Washington health clinic.Martin Shkreli, CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, donated $2,700, the maximum allowed for individual donors, in September, he told Stat. While the Sanders campaign initially thanked Shkreli for his contribution, a campaign spokesman told Stat this week that it would donate the money to Whitman-Walker health clinic.Shkreli, who raised the price of Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per tablet after acquiring it in August, told Stat that he donated in part to get a meeting with Sanders to explain how drug prices were set. Sanders has refused to meet with him.After backlash over the sudden increase, Shkreli said in September that the company would lower the price. At the beginning of October, ABC News found that the price still remained extremely high.As part of his presidential campaign, Sanders has pushed to lower the cost of prescription drugs. His proposals include allowing Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, allowing the import of drugs from Canada and requiring more transparency on how drug prices are set. When he served in the House, Sanders was also the first member of Congress to lead a group of seniors on a bus trip to Canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs.Shkreli's maximum donation to Sanders also puts him in the minority of Sanders' campaign donors -- only .039 percent of them have given the maximum $2,700. While Sanders raised $27 million in the third quarter of his campaign, the average donation was $30.Also on HuffPost:"
16,POLITICS,This Congressman Thinks We Can Fix The Economy By Drinking Beer,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-defazio-craft-beer_us_56215319e4b0bce34700aa00,"It may or may not help, but we're going to give it our all.",2015-10-17,Bottles of beer and cider produced by Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56215c991200002e007e5542.jpeg?ops=crop_152_86_4753_2971%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"If you want to help the American economy, you should drink more fancy-pants beer, according to Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.).""One of the great things about drinking craft beer is you're helping deal with our trade deficit,"" DeFazio told HuffPost. ""American-made American product, homegrown, as opposed to all these other beers, which are foreign-owned and you're contributing to our trade deficit every time you drink one.""DeFazio's comments came during an interview with HuffPost's ""So, That Happened"" podcast, embedded above. The beer talk starts at 47:40.DeFazio was drawing a contrast between local breweries and the cheap, crappy swill of big-name brands such as Miller and Budweiser. (Cheap, crappy beer is objectively superior to fancy-pants craft beer, your host contends.)DeFazio -- a founding member of the House Small Brewers Conference -- is, of course, just having some fun. He isn't quite right on the technical merits of his economic case, but he seems to be correct in spirit (pun intended). Even though Miller and Anheuser-Busch are owned by foreign conglomerates, High Lifes and Buds are still brewed and bottled stateside. Those bottles aren't imports, and thus don't affect the trade deficit at all.  But drinking foreign-owned beer does have an effect on the current account deficit -- another measure of international trade flows. The share of the profits from Miller and Anheuser-Busch that leave the country have a small negative effect on that metric, while domestically owned craft breweries that keep all of their profits in the U.S. do not. Theoretically, running big current account deficits can harm the economy. Many economists believe doing so can lead to long-term drags on growth and financial dysfunction. If other countries hoard the dollars they receive, it can drive up the relative value of U.S. currency, which sends domestic manufacturing jobs abroad.The U.S. has been running a relatively large current account deficit for decades. But this is mostly an issue with countries that do huge amounts of trade with the United States, such as Japan and China. Anheuser-Busch InBev, which owns Budweiser, is a Belgian-Brazilian conglomerate, while SABMiller is a South African company. To sum up: If you are partial to cheap, crappy beer, then you don't have to feel bad about the trade deficit any more than your snooty craft beer friends. They can, however, troll you on the current account deficit. You're kind of hurting America, even though I toast your taste in beer. Lovers of cheap, crappy beer and fancy-pants craft beer can probably find common ground on a looming megamerger between SABMiller and A-B InBev, however. The deal would create a mega-brewer with control of more than 70 percent of the U.S. market for beer, potentially driving up prices of flavorless swill while creating a ""beerhemoth"" that could lock many craft brewers out of the market.DeFazio called on the U.S. Department of Justice to force major concessions from the companies before approving any deal. He said the combined company should be forced to sell off the MillerCoors division, which would prevent a single firm from owning Budweiser, Miller and Coors. DeFazio also wants DOJ to bar the firm from owning beer distributors.""If you take two huge companies that make bad beer and put 'em together, you get one really, really huge company that makes really bad beer,"" DeFazio joked.Drink responsibly, folks.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Adriana Usero and Peter James Callahan, with assistance from Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

He has given us either the longest goodbye since Bogart in ""Casablanca"" or the longest hello since Castro in Havana.People were bound to lose patience, even before the boffo performances by both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in Tuesday night's debate, not to mention Martin O'Malley's debut as a BuzzFeed-certified hunk.It's finally dawned on Biden World that they've run out of time. A statement is expected any minute, hour or day now.Biden's former chief of staff and longtime Sancho Panza, ex-Sen. Ted Kaufman, sent Biden's friends and allies a letter to calm them as the dramatic moment approached. He assured the troops that, if the vice president indeed were to run, he would do so in the name of the middle class -- as well as in memory of his son Beau, who died of cancer in May.But the decision slog has focused mostly on Joe Biden himself. No talk of an actual agenda. No hint of his assessment of the candidates already in the race. No talk of what the Democrats really need in order to secure a third-straight term in the White House. Instead, we've been shown a saga of grief and inspiration, with Biden offering soulful public updates on the condition of his political heart.Why did he do it this way?Biden is politically savvy and devises strategic and tactical plans at a rapid rate. But they can be contradictory and sometimes pile up like cars on an icy highway. He's both gifted and cursed by the ability to sense all options.He has wanted to be president forever and has already run twice (in 1988 and 2008) with embarrassingly bad results. It's hard not to think third time's the charm, especially since he's been second in command since 2009 and since age might not be a factor given the other top Democratic contenders. (While Biden is 72, Clinton is 67 and Sanders is 74.)First elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden sees himself following in Kennedy footsteps -- minus the big money, the Harvard connections and the grand presidential history of Massachusetts behind him.Then there is Biden World, a vast array of former staffers and permanent friends who adore the man they used to work for. Their hearts ache for the pain he has suffered -- not just the loss of one son, but the deaths of his first wife and daughter in a car accident. They can't bear to tell him that it's over, if indeed it is. They want to accommodate his dreams. And they love being part of the political action, the thrill of being on the inside with a man of certifiable importance, and the cachet they will lose when his career ends.Has the indecision hurt him?Waiting this long certainly hasn't helped him, whatever he decides to do.If he does run, attention will focus on the signs that he was preparing all along but waited to see the shape of the race. Reporters will seek out some Democratic operative who moved to Washington because she had been promised a job in the campaign policy shop, or examine the donors Biden called on the q.t., or lay out all the detailed groundwork of his innermost circle.If he doesn't run, expect his inner circle to leak stories about how earnest and serious he was about entering the race. But there will be lots of reasons not to believe them. People will look back at all the things he did not do, such as call key members of Congress whose support was ""gettable"" by their own description.Either way, Biden looks less and less like a father stalled by grief and more and more like a manipulative politician. So in that sense he has already lost, no matter what he decides.In a ""60 Minutes"" interview last weekend, President Barack Obama praised Biden, calling him perhaps the best vice president ever. But Obama was careful not to recommend Biden as a presidential candidate. In fact, he rather drily observed that running for president is something almost everyone in national politics wants to do.The implication was: Be kind to Joe, for he has an affliction he can't shake.CORRECTION: Sanders' age was incorrect in a previous version. He is 74."

22,ENTERTAINMENT,"Cary Fukunaga On 'Beasts Of No Nation,' His Netflix Gamble And The End Of 'True Detective'",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cary-fukunaga-beasts-of-no-nation_us_5621085de4b069b4e1fbbac1,The director has helmed the streaming service's first original movie.,2015-10-17,"Abraham Attah and Idris Elba star in a scene from ""Beasts of No Nation.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5621c92c12000026007e558e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Netflix, once again, is disrupting the film industry's predominant business model. ""Beasts of No Nation,"" the first movie to premiere on the streaming service, is now available for your home-viewing pleasure. That decision has angered the country's biggest theater chains, which refuse to screen the film despite a simultaneous theatrical release. The Netflix platform is even more of a gamble given the story's harrowing nature. ""Beasts of No Nation"" is a great movie, but it's not exactly something you curl up with when hunting for comfort food.But that's only the start of the woes Cary Fukunaga has seen in making ""Beasts,"" which chronicles Agu (Abraham Attah), a young orphan forced into mercenary service for a West African warlord known simply as Commandant (Idris Elba). After directing the first season of ""True Detective"" (he swears he hasn't seen the dreadful Season 2), Fukunaga headed to Ghana to make the movie. There, he contracted malaria and had to fill in for his camera operator, who pulled a hamstring. Meanwhile, Elba got the flu, the production battled erratic weather conditions and props didn't arrive on time. No matter: Fukunaga barreled through the ordeal and was met with glowing reviews at fall's major film festivals. Whether you see it on Netflix or on the big screen, ""Beasts of No Nation"" -- written and shot by Fukunaga, and based on the 2005 novel by Uzodinma Iweala -- demands your attention. In keeping, The Huffington Post hopped on the phone with Fukunaga to discuss the film. In case you're still wondering, yes, he does know how you feel about the end of ""True Detective."" You’ve shot a visually rich film that most people will see at home on Netflix. As it goes, the revolution will be televised. Obviously this is the business deal you made, but does part of you wish more people could see it on a big screen?Well, it’s kind of the same, though, if your movie comes out in the cinema and gets a limited release and then eventually most people discover it. It’s kind of just the nature of it. People aren’t all going to be able to experience your film in the way you intended them to, which is on a big screen. There’s no doubt that the best way to watch a movie is on the big screen. There’s just nothing that comes to replace that, no matter how much anyone hypes up their home-theater system. It’s tough because we’re getting a pretty wide release -- we’re going to 31 markets in the U.S. and definitely three or four markets in the U.K., and we’re still lobbying with Netflix to try to open it up in more cinemas around the world because I think there’s an opportunity there, but I’m not the voice of Netflix.Will Netflix make you privy to viewership numbers even though it doesn't release ratings?I don’t know. I think they’ll probably remain the same. I’ll probably get a sense of the seat count for per-screen average for theatrical, but I’m not sure if I’ll actually know who’s tuning in to download the film.Are you cool with not knowing? You’re probably used to seeing weekend box-office numbers and overnight TV ratings.That’s a good point. Thanks for making me sleep less well at night.I assume it didn't bother you previously, then.I hadn’t even thought about it yet.Sorry to plant the seed. Don’t even worry about it. Who needs numbers? It’s fine! Let’s talk about the artistic side instead. In writing the script, what was your take on how brutal the movie should be? There’s a fair amount of humor buried in it, but it’s also pretty grisly and tough to watch.I am always hesitant about films that have zero humor in them because I’ve found, in the most dark places, whether it’s gallows humor or something else, that humor still exists. Humor is reality, so although not everyone’s going to laugh at the humor I’ve put in the movie, I try to keep that in there because you need to have, through tragedy, comedy. For me, that’s what makes it more human -- to have those dualities coexisting. But the darkness even isn’t as dark as I could have made it.Part of that balance is in the way you’ve written Idris Elba’s character. He doesn’t fit a lot of the dictator tropes that have become clichés in film. Elba has more swagger than he does theatrics.Part of it was, as opposed to, say, “The Last King of Scotland,” where Idi Amin was the leader of the entire country, Idris’ character is the leader of a military battalion. That’s part of the reason why I wrote in [Dada Goodblood, the supreme commander,] who's sort of a political figurehead. It shows that even this guy has somebody to answer to. There’s always a bigger fish, and that character, in a way, castigates or really humiliates Commandant in terms of his limitations. He’s not fit to be a political leader once the world is watching. He’s a very effective bulldog, so I think Idris did a very good job playing that swagger and playing the capriciousness of a somehow adolescent-like military man. I’ve seen leaders like him -- leaders on a small level who will never be leaders on a national level. He can lead a band of men, but he can never take that and transition it to more widespread power. He’ll make decisions on a whim without really thinking about what the consequences are. Representation is something the culture is very consciousness of right now. Even though you had the novel as source material, for a filmmaker who isn’t from the area you’re depicting, what did you do to ensure you were telling the right story?In terms of research, I did a ton. I was a poli-sci and a history major, and when I do history on real subjects I approach it as if I were writing an article about it and try to saturate myself in facts and details and anecdotal information and first-person testimonials. I’d done research with former combatants, displaced people, mercenaries, British and U.S. military involved in the conflicts, as well as, during the production, working with a commander who had taken part in the wars in Sierra Leone and in Liberia. A lot of what I did was based on that reality, even though it is fiction.And what went into the decision to set it in an unnamed country?That was in the book, and I think Uzo and I were on the same page all the way through development on this in that if we were to place it in Nigeria during the Biafra War or in Sierra Leone during its war or Burkina Faso or anywhere where these coups d'état or cyclical regime changes are taking place, that these kinds of wars aren’t so dissimilar. If we had to get into the nitty-gritty history of one, it feels like it’s less applicable to the others. Because they are so similar, it just seems like you can transpose the regions and the details of the war on the other. Of course, there are always nuances and it’s dangerous to generalize, but it was important that it feel more allegorical as well in terms of the kid’s experience, which was the most important thing.Are those the specific settings you had in mind, even if you didn’t intend the film as a literal representation? Yeah, because you have to nail down certain things so that your production designer knows what to base things on and your costume designer knows what to base things on. You can obviously make it all fantasy and fiction, but it’s better if it’s somehow rooted in reality, so I sort of did a mixture of Ghanian history using some of the plot points of the war in Sierra Leone. You shot a pivotal battle scene using what appears to be infrared film. It's one of the movie's best moments. What does that scene mean to you?It was in the book that when Agu first takes hallucinogenic drugs, the colors would shift and change. He described the leaves dripping red from the blood, so I took that pretty literally. In 2006, when I was writing the screenplay, I figured out that I’d probably shoot it, assuming we’d be shooting in a photochemical world, on infrared, similar to what Oliver Stone had done in the India sequence on “Alexander.” That was gonna be the goal for that section, and then ultimately we didn’t end up shooting on film and they discontinued infrared stock a couple of years ago. We tried using infrared on “True Detective” as well for Rust Cohle’s hallucinogenic sequences, and we couldn’t find infrared stock anywhere. So I ended up doing a digital effect that mimics infrared. Speaking of “True Detective,” are you happy to go back to film for the moment, knowing this won't be as heavily scrutinized as the first season of that show was?I didn’t really feel any kind of over-scrutiny with “True Detective.” It was more exciting that people were that interested in the details we put into the story, even if they were ultimately disappointed with the ending. It’s so different. This is such a different genre, this film, that I never figured it would be held to the same standards, in a way. It cost about the same as an episode of “True Detective” would cost, and this is a whole film.Did you take into account the attention paid to ""True Detective"" when you first decided to do ""The Alienist,"" your next TV project? It seems like it could generate a similar level of chatter. Man, I hadn’t even really considered it. “The Alienist” is going to be ultimately compared to “True Detective” only in that it’s going to be a limited series and because it’s another crime series about crimes that involve children, and we’re trying to investigate it. But what draws me to that story is so different, and the writers are so different that I don’t know how the audience is going to respond. I don’t think I could ever anticipate that because even on “True Detective” I had no idea it was going to get that kind of response. I’m always mildly surprised that people like what I do.Did you keep up with fan theories? Some of them got pretty ludicrous.My agent is the biggest fanboy ever and reads all the blogs, so he would usually send me stuff along. I kept up that way, but I went to Ghana at the end of February last year, so I didn’t even see the whole rollout of the show. I was deep in pre-production, so I kind of stopped following it at some point. But when I got back, I would see some of the memes and some of the “SNL” and other skits. I thought it was hilarious. It was just awesome to have something you’d done go mainstream like that in the best possible way.""Beasts of No Nation"" is now in select theaters and available on Netflix.

Homosexuality is criminalized in Myanmar.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561638301400002a00c79707.jpeg?cache=VDYQ5Qlrjm&ops=crop_0_229_5000_2933%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"This is the seventh part of a 10-part series on LGBT rights in Southeast Asia, which uncovers the challenges facing the LGBT community in the region and highlights the courageous work of activists there.***When a group of transgender women was arrested by police officers in the city of Mandalay, Myanmar, in 2013, they were allegedly forced to strip in public, before being taken to a nearby police station where they were “repeatedly punched and kicked.”“They were then forced to parade naked as if on a catwalk, while being photographed, as well as made to hop like frogs, clean the shoes of the police and answer demeaning questions about their sex lives,” The Telegraph reported .A police spokesman said at the time that the cops had been performing a “public service” by preventing the group from congregating.Hla Myat Tun, a human rights activist with the Burmese LGBT group Colors Rainbow, tells The Huffington Post that such “state-sponsored discrimination” is a grave concern for the LGBT community in Myanmar, where homosexuality is criminalized.Earlier this year, Myint Kyu, a politician in Mandalay, came under fire from human rights groups for “making misinformed, discriminatory, and potentially inflammatory statements about gay and transgender people.” During an August parliamentary debate, Kyu, who is the city’s border and security affairs minister was quoted as saying that the government was “constantly taking action to have the gays detained at police stations” before “educating” them.Like Malaysia, Myanmar -- also a former British colony -- still has Section 377 of the penal code on its books. The law criminalizes “carnal intercourse,” which includes same-sex intercourse. It is punishable by 10 years to life in prison. (Myanmar's famous politician and human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi has called for the repeal of Section 377 in the past.)Under the rule of an oppressive military junta from 1962 to 2011, Myanmar was long considered to be a “pariah state,” until widespread reforms prompted an increase of political freedom within the country and a partial thawing of relations with the outside world. Tun says that although the LGBT community has had “greater visibility” since these reforms were put in place, it still isn't treated with respect.“[LGBT persons] dare not live openly … in the society,” she says. “They are seen as a group of morally wrong people fighting for sexual freedom.”LGBT people are often targets for abuse and discrimination in Myanmar. According to Civil Rights Defenders, the legal limitations make it “difficult for LGBT persons to live openly and without fear of persecution.”Limited public awareness about LGBT issues is another major problem facing the community, Tun says, as is a dearth of activists.In a 2013 interview with the Myanmar Times, a 28-year-old gay man named Phyo described the invisibility of LGBT people in Burmese culture.“When I was growing up, we didn’t know about homosexuals,” he said. His only exposure to the LGBT community was “when he saw them being treated badly in the community.”“I felt unsafe because of that,” Phyo said. “Sometimes I would cry alone.”A 2014 Guardian report discussed how hostility against homosexuality was undermining the fight against HIV/AIDS in Myanmar -- which, according to the World Health Organization, has one of Asia's highest HIV prevalence rates.Stigma is keeping gay men hidden, making them “hard to reach in the most extreme sense,” Eamonn Murphy, a UNAIDS country representative, told the news outlet.Myanmar's National AIDS Programme said at the time that fewer than 30 percent of the estimated 240,000 gay men in Myanmar had received HIV prevention services. Political reforms have been slowing in Myanmar since 2014, according to Human Rights Watch. In some cases, “reversals of basic freedoms and democratic progress” have been observed, the group said this year. Also on HuffPost:"
24,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Explains How Taxing The Rich Will Pay For His Policies,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-tax-the-rich_us_5622670ae4b0bce34700f168,But he admits it could take more than higher contributions from the top 1 percent alone.,2015-10-17,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) insists that he can pay for his plans by taxing the rich.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562267d21400002200c7a2d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is adamant that only wealthy Americans will need to pay higher taxes to fund his proposals for expanding government social programs.Bill Maher, who interviewed Sanders on HBO’s “Real Time” on Friday night, pressed Sanders on the point.“Now this has been studied, the amount of tax revenue we would get just from taxing the people who I think your fans think you’re talking about -- the people who own a yacht -- does not come close to covering what you want to pay for,” Maher argued.“Not true, not true,” the Democratic presidential hopeful responded.Sanders then went through the largest items on his policy agenda -- Medicare for all; free college tuition at public institutions; higher Social Security benefits; and free child care -- and explained how each of them would only require asking more of wealthy Americans.But Sanders acknowledged that he might need to raise taxes on more than the top 1 percent of earners.“We may have to go down a little bit lower than that, but not much lower,” Sanders said.The top 1 percent is made up of 1.13 million households with average incomes of $2.1 million a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. The New York Times estimates that increasing those households’ total tax burden from roughly one-third today to 40 percent would raise an additional $157 billion in revenue per year.To put that amount in perspective, the Times noted that Sanders’ plan to cover the cost of undergraduate tuition at a public college or university would cost the federal government $47 billion.Sanders intends to pay for his college plan, however, by taxing financial transactions. He has introduced Social Security legislation that expands benefits and extends the program’s solvency by eliminating the cap on taxable earnings, which currently means millionaires only contribute to the program on the first $118,500 they earn.The senator told Maher he would pay for child care by closing corporate tax loopholes.The arithmetic on a single-payer health care system is a little bit trickier. Although Sanders has not yet released a detailed single-payer plan, a similar bill introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) would be financed in part by payroll taxes on middle-income and wealthy earners.An analysis of the plan by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, projects that Conyers’ bill would reduce overall health care costs by $592 billion per year, ultimately saving consumers money.It is also not clear how Sanders’ promise not to tax the middle class squares with his paid family leave plan. He backs a bill introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), which would finance a proposed mandate for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave with payroll tax contributions from all workers.Also on HuffPost:Also on HuffPost:"

People move into these tiny houses to save money, reduce their environmental footprint, and to live a simpler life.But before there were tiny houses, there were tiny churches.These little sacred spaces are often tucked away in green forests or down old country roads. They may be small, but they're just enough for the rural communities that built them many decades ago.Travel site Roadside America has some advice for people who stumble on these churches during trips across the country: ""When you visit a small church, always show respect. In our experience, they are unlocked, unattended, and empty of visitors. Sit in a pew, sign the guest book, contribute a donation or offering, and don't break anything.""Scroll down to see photos of 15 charming tiny churches. Also on HuffPost:"
