They've got to figure out what to give the people who help change their kids' diapers, fix them after-school snacks and tuck them in at night.With both parents active in the workforce in nearly 60 percent of American families, nannies and babysitters are an increasingly important part of the family unit. And in this promising holiday economy -- holiday spending is estimated to be up 4.1 percent this year to $586.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation -- people are prepared to shell out for their family's caregivers.Sitters in some areas can expect bigger bonuses than others -- residents of Park Slope, New York, for example, will be giving their nannies an average $720 bonus, according to a local survey. Others will get more modest gifts, like Starbucks gifts cards and baked goods.A new survey by UrbanSitter reveals that 75 percent of parents plan on giving their babysitter a gift or bonus this holiday season, and when it comes to nannies, that number jumps to 97 percent. The most popular gift for nannies is one week's pay, while 44 percent of parents give their babysitters more than $75 for a holiday or year-end bonus.So how much should you be giving your babysitter or nanny this season? Check out UrbanSitter's infographic below to see what other parents are doing.Source: UrbanSitter. The UrbanSitter Holiday Bonus study was fielded in November and December 2012. It includes results from 395 parent respondents."

And this year, they'll have a whole lot more to experience with the recent opening of the new Fantasyland, the largest expansion ever in the Magic Kingdom's history.Lucky for me, I had the privilege of previewing this new addition and experiencing all that it has to offer with one of the most discerning theme park critics I know: my three-year old daughter.

I know you do. There's that image of a town with candles in windows. There are those trees tapped for sugaring. And there's that swirling nighttime snow.Up-north country store images pop to mind as easily as anything: the pot-bellied stove, the barrels of pickles and crackers, the ring of pipe-puffers huddled around jawing about the dopey things city folk do. The Vermont Country Store is one of the few places left which remember how these village stores were ground zero for both socializing and shopping -- even though it now sells most of its products via catalog and online. When Vrest Orton started the business in 1946, he tried to bring back whatever products he could find from the North Calais, Vt. store the family had run in the late 19th century. This makes The Vermont Country Store the first ""restored rural store in the nation"" and, you'd bet, one of the inspirations behind Restoration Hardware and other big-time hawkers of nostalgia. Since The Vermont Country Store goes by the principle that everything sold ""must be useful, work and make sense,"" I thought it might be fun to test out a typical selection of their old time products to see if they're as good as -- or better -- than some contemporary brand-names found in Wal-Mart or CVS. (Note: Not all of the following are guaranteed to be in-stock.)Here's a hot-off-the-stove report:1. Scottie Dog Licorice Tin  Scottish Terriers are big here at The Vermont Country Store. Click the Scottie Dog Licorice Tin on the store's website, and it used to inform you that ""You might also like our Lanz of Salzburg Scottie dog pajamas in 100% cotton flannel or our Magnetic Scottie Tricky Dogs."" You can't have too many dog-themed products I say, and when a friend of mine tried feeding one of these little black licorice treats to her West Highland Terrier, it was eagerly snarfed down without any breed jealousy. I liked the taste, too, though some of the candies are slightly disfigured and there's a too-soft Gummy Bear texture. Compared to the Twizzlers name-brand licorice I tried, the Scotties are spicier. The shiny tartan tin should keep these Scotties fresh for years to come, unless you discover (like me) that you've reached the bottom of the one-pound container in a couple of hours.2. Vinolia Boracic & Cold Cream Bath Soap Loaded with cold cream and some stuff that you can't pronounce (""boracic"" is British for boric acid), Vinolia brags that it was the one and only bath bar supplied to first-class cabins aboard the Titanic. ""Some marketing angle,"" snapped my wife as she filled our tub for a showdown versus Dove and Camay. ""It's probably unlucky soap."" As things turned out, Vinolia lathered better, felt smoother and had a much less sickly scent than either of its modern competitors. And while Titanic passengers had only a couple of days to benefit from Vinolia's complexion-pampering formula, Kathy's now convinced that this mammoth (5.9 oz.) slab is worth ordering again -- if it ever runs out. (An extra bonus: Since boric acid kills ants, it should keep the bathroom insect free.) 3. Original Bozo the Clown 3-D Bop Bag Okay, so this isn't your classic country store item. Last seen in the 1960s, not 1860s, Bozo's still a lot more interesting than a canvas punching bag you might find at Sports Authority, so I couldn't resist. It took me almost an hour to huff and puff Bozo into prime boxing condition, but once I did he measured up at an imposing 46"" tall and it was a pleasure to nail him again and again on his squeaky ""3-D"" nose. Take that! My cats, Emily and Betty, enjoyed the sound of Bozo's sand-filled base and the base swung him upright again and again to receive even more punches. Wait! Betty, stop. Bozo isn't a scratching post! Pop. Warning: Be sure to keep Bozo the Clown 3-D Bop Bag away from household pets.4. Hobo Soup  According to legend (okay, the story's on the can label), Hobo Soup was discovered in 1953 by a small-town newspaper reporter from Minnesota who was scouring hobo camps in search of a story. Instead, he got soup: this almost frosting-thick concoction of beans, more beans, potatoes, bacon, carrots, tomatoes, celery, onions and turnips. Yep, I know hobos are hungry, very hungry, and it's key that a good hobo soup stick to the ribs. But, ulp, all this mush topped off with the ""Added Smoke Flavoring"" kind of got to me partway through the 15-oz. can. This is sure to bring angry letters from hobos coast-to-coast, but I ended up preferring the Campbell's Select ""Vegetable Medley"" that I tried. A boring soup, but no Navy beans and, well, the stuff slides down.5. Ipana Wintergreen Toothpaste This tasty old-fashioned toothpaste pretty much went off the radar after the 1970s and I, for one, am glad it's back. Hate to brush? Using Ipana Wintergreen Toothpaste is a bit like cleaning your teeth with a Life Saver. I'm told that some Ipana fans have to remind themselves not to swallow, though to be honest I don't recommend eating it. It's hard to find any other wintergreen flavored pastes, so I took a crack at comparing Ipana to Crest ""Cool Peppermint"" paste. Although the tube tells you it's full of the same stuff Crest is, including sorbitol, hydrated silica, fluoride and the like, Ipana foams a lot less in your mouth and, hey... I wonder if they make this stuff in butterscotch or wild cherry?Peter Mandel went to Vermont's Middlebury College and his family is originally from Montpelier.

(Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Clear Channel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1a15b3c000018010be0be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At this time a year ago, as we all prepared for the holidays and school vacations, there were approximately 38,000 people in New York City--including 16,000 children--who did not have a stable place to live. Over the course of the year, those numbers grew to more than 47,000. Now, as we end 2012, many of those families still lack stable housing, and their ranks have swelled again with the thousands of people left homeless by Hurricane Sandy.From the beginning, it was clear that Sandy was not like other storms. This hurricane affected an area the size of Western Europe. In addition to the tragic loss of life, the storm caused upwards of $80 billion in damages. It wasn't the wind that did all the damage, but rather the storm surges that destroyed the first floors and basements of thousands and thousands of homes. This clearly was a full-blown catastrophe.While Robin Hood is not a traditional disaster-relief organization, we were prepared to help. With nearly 25 years of experience as New York's largest poverty-fighting organization, and our expertise in providing assistance to victims of 9/11, we knew that many of the front-line, hyper-local organizations that assist New Yorkers every day would benefit from our help and funding. As a result of our support, food pantries drove their mobile soup kitchens into hard-hit communities they didn't normally serve; volunteers went door-to-door delivering food, blankets and other vital support to people stranded in dark and freezing public housing projects; benefits counselors and attorneys fanned out to advocate for and assist people with applying for their rightful benefits. We also re-activated the Robin Hood Relief Fund, enabling us to further provide funding and other support to those organizations best positioned to assist Sandy victims. Less than two months ago, the Relief Fund started with $1 million and grew to $16 million, all of which has now been allocated in grants ranging in size from $10,000 to $1 million to more than 140 organizations. The groups we funded have extended or provided new services, developing thoughtful and strategic ways to help thousands of people in need. The Relief Fund has been more than replenished through ""12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief."" The one-night-only event, featuring some of the biggest names in music, movies, and television, grabbed the attention of people across the world who generously responded with support. Thirteen thousand people attended the concert and millions of viewers tuned in and contributed to the Sandy relief effort. Robin Hood will distribute the $50 million of initial proceeds for ""12-12-12"" to organizations helping to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. Fundraising efforts have included ticket sales, sponsorships, telephone and web donations and merchandise with additional money still coming in. Over the next several months, we will take every penny that was raised and grant funds to the most effective organizations helping low-income victims and vulnerable populations in New York City, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. Through the Robin Hood Relief Fund, we've been able to touch lives across the tri-state region. There's the 91-year old woman who emailed to thank us for making it possible for organizations like City Meals on Wheels to deliver food to her door. There are 17 low-income families in Monmouth County, New Jersey, left homeless from the storm, who will have new roofs over their heads in the New Year. These stories show us that while the road is long, there is hopeI know a woman whose home in the Rockaways was destroyed by fires resulting from the hurricane. She suffers from multiple sclerosis and is confined to a motorized wheelchair. With the tide rising and flames licking the sides of her home, she was forced to hurl herself into the floodwaters. Moments later, a neighbor rescued her on his surfboard and paddled her to safety. Now, living in an apartment that is not handicap accessible, and using a wheelchair that does not meet her needs, she will tell you about the experience: ""It was exciting! I had never surfed before!""These stories are a reminder of how brave, resilient, and supportive communities across the tri-state area have been in the face of this immense tragedy. We're honored to be a part of their story through the incredible local organizations we work alongside each day. As Bruce Springsteen sang during ""Land of Hope and Dreams,"" at Wednesday's concert: ""Well, you don't know where you're goin' now, But you know you won't be back/Well darlin' if you're weary, Lay your head upon my chest/We'll take what we can carry, And we'll leave the rest.""Although the fight is far from over, we're hopeful this holiday season because of the strength we witness each day."

We all do it. We are serious about our commitments at first, and then, somehow, we fall into old patterns. As a retired teacher, mother and grandmother, my resolutions have changed since the tragic shooting at Newtown. Conn. My resolutions this year will not include the ten pounds I want to shed, nor will it included my narcissistic need for self-improvement. This year I am resolved never to forget the teachers, parents and grandparents who find themselves so horribly involved in the mourning process caused by one disturbed gunman. I look at my grandchildren with such gratitude that they are safe. I think I am going to listen and treasure all that they bring me because their happiness is so vital. My five year old grandson has had so much to say to me this week about his experiences at school. Somehow, I think I have listened more carefully. I can't help but remember some of the times I have been faced with loss while I was a teacher. The loss of Elizabeth Glaser and her little daughter to AIDS; the loss of my head room parent when she was killed in a car crash while my second grade student, her daughter, sat in the back seat; the loss of a little seven-year-old boy when he was accidentally hit in the head by a baseball and consequently died; the loss of a forty-year-old mother riddled with cancer who was an anesthesiologist in the birthing section of a nearby hospital; the loss of grandparents and pets and dear friends... however, the loss of innocence due to unnecessary gunfire seems impossible for me to understand. The one safe place other than home, where we as teachers work tirelessly to make our students feel safe, has been stolen from us. The fire drills, the earthquake drills and all of the other measures taken to keep our children safe mean nothing when mental illness presides. I would like to think that all of the teachers at that school were heroes long before the gunman entered the school. The preparation that teachers make for the purpose of creating a loving atmosphere for their students is far greater than parents might think. The tireless daily efforts of embracing their little children comes from a place deep within the heart and psyche of the teacher.I have asked myself during this past week to try to make some sense out of this horrible event. Each time I sat down at the computer all I was able to do was to cry. My mind was so overcome with this tragedy that I was not able to process what I wanted to write on my blog. I believe I am finally clear. For the new year I want to have hope again that this will not happen to anyone, no less little defenseless children. I want to have hope that some of the high powered guns will be removed from the public. I want children to be able to claim their rights to be safe at school. Oh yes, I WILL remember what happened one week ago. I am going to fulfill this resolution and I will pray that the tortured parents and families in Newtown will find peace.

The owners give greed a bad name, but the players -- more destructively -- give unions a bad name. Here are a bunch of guys doing what they love, what they'd probably be doing in their spare time for fun, now making more a year than your average fan would make in a decade, demanding more. Not that the owners are princes, or any kind of benign dictator. They certainly make more than the players. The way to resolve this, as far as I'm concerned, is to have the union stay pretty much where it is and have the players demand that the owners pay the people who work for them, the concessionaires and janitors and security people who keep their places running. These are the folks who could use the money. The owners and players are just involved in a nationally covered pissing contest that will soon be a longer running enterprise than the season.  I was raised in a union house, I have worked as a union agitator, and I am currently a member of yet another union. And in a way, the NHL conflict is a classic union dispute: the owners make their fortunes off the backs of the players. It's the scale of the thing that upsets me. Neither the players, nor the union members are hurting, they just want to prove who has the bigger cojones, and in the end they risk losing it all because they alienate the good will of their bread and butter -- the working class folks who fill the seats and watch them on cable.   Some of those folks work for Wal-Mart, and if there were ever a union cause worth supporting, on so many levels, the Wal-Mart employees is that crusade. Of course, this is difficult for anyone on the outside: If you boycott Wal-Mart (an impossible task in some locales), the workers eventually lose anyway, because the stores just fire them. Yet, for them to work for the limited wages and for no benefits at what is often the only game in town brings back the era of the company store, another day older and deeper in debt.   And over the past four years, similar things have happened in DC. For the benefit of the two percent of who can afford to hire lobbyists, the House of Representatives continues to prove that the opposite of progress is Congress. While people who work for Wal-Mart (and millions of other Americans, and myself for that matter) remain under-employed, a paycheck away from further disaster (most are in trouble already), Congress engages in a partisan pissing contest that makes the NHL and the Owners look like kids at camp. With the ""fiscal cliff"" making the average person feel a bit like Thelma and Louise without the elation (or perhaps Wile E. Coyote), DC has dug in its heels.   The question remains: What do they seek? As Roger Fisher, William Ury and Bruce Patton in their excellent book on the art of negotiating, Getting To Yes, position and posturing often get in the way of what the negotiation is really about: what are the opposing sides' interests? It would seem to me that ending the lockout would serve the NHL's and players' interests, listening to their constituents and not the lobbyists would ultimately end the standoff on Capitol Hill, and Wal-Mart would be best served by pumping some of their financial capital into their human capital -- no one likes grumpy retail workers, and frankly some of the people who've served me on my rare forays into Wal-Mart were some of the best retail workers I have encountered. How much better would they be if they and their families had health benefits and a living wage?While it is in no one's interest to go over the cliff (none of us can defy gravity -- even briefly -- like Wile E. Coyote), and Congress will find a way to prevent that (cue Mel Brooks in Blazing Saddles as Governor Lepetomane to his cabinet: ""Gentlemen, we must protect our phony-baloney jobs!"") can anyone suggest a way to avoid four more years of pissing contests and partisan intransigence? Maybe someone should hire Fisher, Ury and Patton as lobbyists."

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e19f200000e800000fe2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From Forbes: With their enthusiastic backing of President Obama and the Democratic Party on Election Day, the bluest parts of America may have embraced a program utterly at odds with their economic self-interest. The almost uniform support of blue states’ congressional representatives for the administration’s campaign for tax “fairness” represents a kind of bizarre economic suicide pact.Any move to raise taxes on the rich — defined as households making over $250,000 annually — strikes directly at the economies of these states, which depend heavily on the earnings of high-income professionals, entrepreneurs and technical workers. In fact, when you examine which states, and metropolitan areas, have the highest concentrations of such people, it turns out they are overwhelmingly located in the bluest states and regions.Ironically the new taxes will have relatively little effect on the detested Romney uber-class, who derive most of their income from capital gains, taxed at a much lower rate. They also have access to all manner of offshore dodges. Nor will it have much impact on Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires, or the Hollywood moguls and urban land speculators who constitute the Democratic Party’s “good rich,” and enjoy many of the same privileges as their wealthy conservative counterparts.More from Forbes: Aging America: States Going Grey The Fastest The Cities Where American's Are Moving NowThe people whose wallets will be drained in the new war on “the rich” are high-earning, but hardly plutocratic professionals like engineers, doctors, lawyers, small business owners and the like. Once seen as the bastion of the middle class, and exemplars of upward mobility, these people are emerging as the modern day “kulaks,” the affluent peasants ruthlessly targeted by Stalin in the early 1930s.The ironic geography of the Democratic drive can be seen most clearly by examining the distribution of the classes now targeted by the coming purge. The top 10 states with the largest percentage of “rich” households under the Obama formula include true blue bastions Washington, D.C., which has the highest concentration of big earners, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, California and Hawaii. The only historic “swing state” in the top six is Virginia, due largely to the presence of the affluent suburbs of the capital. These same states, according to the Tax Foundation, would benefit the most from an extension of the much-lambasted Bush tax cuts.The pattern of distribution of “the rich” is even more marked when we focus on metropolitan areas. Big metro areas supported Obama, particularly their core cities, by margins as high as four to one. Besides New York, the metro areas with the highest percentage of high-earning households include such lockstep blue cities as San Francisco, Washington, San Jose, Atlanta and Los Angeles.The income tax hit may not be the only pain inflicted on these areas in the President’s drive for greater “fairness.” Moves to curb mortgage interest deductions for affluent households also would fall predominately on these same areas. The states with the highest listing prices — and the biggest mortgages on average – are the president’s home state of Hawaii, followed by the District of Columbia, New York, California and Connecticut. According to the Census Bureau and the Federal Housing Agency, median home values in California are 200% higher than the national median, and in New York they’re 150% higher; in contrast, red Texas’ prices are below the median.The contrast in prices is even greater between metropolitan areas. The highest prices — and thus largest mortgages — are in the deep blue havens of San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. If the mortgage interest deduction is capped for loans, say, over $300,000, homeowners in these cities will suffer far more than in key red state cities like Dallas or Houston, where homes are at least half the price.The curbing of the mortgage interest deduction constitutes only one part of a broader effort to cut back on all itemized deductions. This would hit states with the highest rates of people taking such deductions: California, New York, the District of Columbia, Connecticut and New Jersey, according to the Wall Street Journal. In contrast, the states least vulnerable to this kind of leveling reform would be either red states such as Indiana, Alaska or Kentucky, or classic “swing” states such as Iowa and Ohio.Of course, one can argue that these changes follow the precepts of social justice: Rich people and rich regions should pay more. Yet being “rich” means different things in different places, due to vast differences in costs of living. The cost of living in New York and Los Angeles, for example, is so high that the adjusted value of salaries rank in the bottom fifth in the nation. In other words, a couple with two children with a $150,000 income in Austin or Raleigh may be, in terms of housing and personal consumption, far “richer” than one making twice that in New York or Los Angeles. (See “The Cities Where A Paycheck Stretches The Furthest“)What would a big tax increase on the “rich” mean to the poor and working classes in these areas? To be sure, they may gain via taxpayer-funded transfer payments, but it’s doubtful that higher taxes will make their prospects for escaping poverty much brighter. For the most part, the economies of the key blue regions are very dependent on the earnings of the mass affluent class, and their spending is critical to overall growth. Singling out the affluent may also reduce the discretionary spending that drives employment in the personal services sector, retail and in such key fields as construction.This prospect is troubling since many of these areas are already among the most unequal in America. In the expensive blue areas, the lower-income middle class population that would benefit from the Administration’s plan of keeping the Bush rates for them is proportionally smaller, although the numbers of the poor, who already pay little or nothing in income taxes, generally greater. Indeed, according to a recent Census analysis, the two places with the highest proportions of poor people are Washington, D.C., and California. By far the highest level of inequality among the country’s 25 most populous counties is in Manhattan.Finally we have to consider the impact of the new tax rates on the fiscal health of these states. Four of the five states in the poorest shape fiscally, according to a recent survey by 24/7 Wall Street, all have congressional delegations dominated by Democrats — California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Illinois (the one red state is Arizona). Slower economic growth brought about by higher taxes — compounded by high state taxes — is unlikely to make their situation any better.So what can we expect to happen if the fiscal cliff appears, or if the President and his party get their taxes on the rich? One can expect a proportionally greater impact on citizens and the budgets of the already expensive, high-tax states, where the new kulak class is concentrated. It may also spark a greater migration of people and companies to less expensive, lower-tax areas.Perhaps the greatest irony in all this is that the Republicans, largely detested in the deep blue bastions, are the ones most likely to fall on their swords to maintain lower rates for the the mass affluent class in the bluest states and metros. If they were something other than the stupid party, or perhaps a bit more cynical, they would respond to the President’s tax proposals by taking a line from their doddering cultural icon, Clint Eastwood: make my day.Here are the five states whose residents stand to lose the most from a failure to reach a deal on the fiscal.

""What I want you to know is that Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatization, not a realistic portrayal of the facts.

On his Facebook page, the 43-year-old, who used to run West Coast Choppers out of Long Beach, Calif, writes that he witnessed so many shootings that having a gun was the only thing that made him feel safe.

12,ENTERTAINMENT,The Three Best Christmas Movies,"John Farr, Contributor
Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-three-best-christmas_us_5bb40dfde4b066f8d2541a6f,"Christmas movies are a genre unto themselves: between live-action and animated features, there are literally hundreds of titles out there.

Lord knows there's plenty to choose from. Christmas movies are a genre unto themselves: between live-action and animated features, there are literally hundreds of titles out there. Inevitably, some are pretty bad, others amusingly cheesy.Given all this choice and volume, it's striking how my own picks for the top three Christmas movies were released over a single five-year period following the Second World War. The first came out just before Christmas in 1946, the second in 1947, the last in 1951. The first two were U.S. productions, the last a U.K release.With all it's come to mean to multiple generations of viewers, it's hard to believe that Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life was a box-office disappointment on release. Was this because the release of the blockbuster war film The Best Years Of Our Lives several weeks before stole its thunder? Perhaps- but more likely, the dark undercurrents in Capra's film simply turned off a war-weary audience.Fortunately, this magical, still powerful film got its re-birth on television, and the rest is history. With each successive viewing of this perennial Christmas film, the familiar story lodges more deeply in our consciousness.On Christmas Eve, 1946, small-town banker George Bailey (James Stewart) becomes embroiled in scandal and overwhelmed by a sense of personal failure. Stopped from leaping to his death by awkward guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers), Bailey recounts his eventful life on the road to ruin, from marriage to high-school sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed) to his final showdown with tyrannical town banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). George also learns the value of a single life -- his own -- when Clarence makes his despairing wish never to have been born temporarily come true.By showing a desperate man brought back from the brink with the realization he already possesses all that's truly important, the film makes an eloquent statement that pays off its title. It's a message of affirmation that resonates, particularly over the Holidays.My second pick is The Bishop's Wife, released the following year by legendary producer Samuel Goldwyn. It is a much lighter, cheerier affair than ""Life"" but also touches on the importance of family, friendship and good will over material concerns.Cary Grant portrays Dudley, the most charming of angels who visits Earth at holiday time to set a certain cleric's priorities straight. It seems Bishop Henry Braugham (played by David Niven) is obsessed with raising funds to build an immense cathedral, and in the process is neglecting his loving wife, daughter, and the humble people he knew when he was a young minister. Co-starring a dazzling Loretta Young as the title character, this buoyant, joyful film seems to get better with every viewing. Notably, the production did not get off to a smooth start. Originally, Grant was playing the Bishop, Niven the angel, Teresa Wright the wife. Goldwyn was not pleased with the dailies, and finally decided to fire director Willam A. Seiter. Henry Koster was brought on to helm the picture, and a now visibly pregnant Wright was replaced by Loretta Young.Koster immediately saw the problem: the two male stars were playing the wrong roles; they should switch. Once Goldwyn and Grant finally agreed to this, production started from scratch -- with Goldwyn out close to a million dollars.It was a bold move that paid off: the film was a hit. (Coincidentally, as with Life the year before, the film earned five Oscar nods, including Best Picture.)A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens's most widely read work, has experienced countless film iterations, including a high-gloss Hollywood entry from the thirties with Reginald Owen, a musical version with Albert Finney, an admirable TV special starring the late George C. Scott, and a modern day adaptation with Bill Murray.Yet none of these tops the definitive 1951 British version, also known as Scrooge, starring the incomparable Alastair Sim in a role he was born to play.This gifted actor seamlessly inhabits the character of the world's most famous miser who, one Christmas Eve, gets a chance at redemption with some spectral visits, first from his deceased partner Jacob Marley (Michael Hordern), then by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and ""Yet to Come"". Ultimately, the sour skinflint is transformed into a jolly, almost child-like fellow who resolves to use his remaining time and fortune to help those in need. Heading the list is his own underpaid, browbeaten clerk, Bob Cratchit (Mervyn Johns), and his family. With no nonsense direction from Brian Desmond-Hurst, the film does a brisk but faithful rendering of Dickens's tale in just 85 minutes. Yet Scrooge remains extremely moving, with Sim's droopy eyes projecting all of his character's terror, shame, and regret. By contrast, his outright giddiness at the film's conclusion should leave you feeling very much in the holiday spirit.All these years later, this particular Scrooge remains the finest telling of our most famous and enduring Christmas story.When I hear again (to my genuine sorrow) how everyone under 30 has abandoned black and white films, I think of these three titles. What a shame if the younger generation overlooks them. Here's my heartfelt holiday suggestion, and fervent hope: that one or more of these evergreen classics plays on your home screen this Christmas Eve.Looking for good movies to watch?

These are terms that Americans have been hearing with regularity since the election. The conversation will be ratcheted up during December, as the clock ticks and the American public waits to see if the president and Congress can reach a resolution.People understand that the stakes are high, but they may not be sure in what way. In trying to get a handle on how the fiscal cliff would impact environmental concerns, I reached out to Chris Hellman, Senior Research Analyst at the National Priorities Project. He gave me a basic primer on the different elements of the equation.Hellman explained that during the final month of 2012, the ""lame duck"" Congress -- comprised of numerous lawmakers who were not reelected -- might choose not to do the hard work of solidifying a plan and striking a deal. Rather, they may opt to punt the problem over to the incoming Congress. If so, that is where sequestration comes in. To deal with the budget, a comprehensive 8.2 percent cut will go into effect. Hellman qualified that option as ""sweeping, mindless, across- the-board cuts that don't discriminate against what is meritorious."" Why? Simply because it will affect national programs ranging from school lunches provided to children in need -- to the running and operating of national parks.In the case of environmental enforcement, Hellman told me that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees could be cut. This will make existing laws more difficult to implement, and will engender a ""backslide"" of the progress made on environmental legislation.The same day I spoke with Hellman, I heard President Obama address a crowd. He underscored, ""This debate is not just about numbers... It's about getting the long term deficit under control."" The White House Office of Management and Budget report dated September 14, 2012 (OMB Report Pursuant To The Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012) asserts in its introduction:  In August 2011, bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate voted for the threat of sequestration as a mechanism to force Congress to act on further deficit reduction. The specter of harmful across-the-board cuts to defense and nondefense programs was intended to drive both sides to compromise. The sequestration itself was never intended to be implemented. The Administration strongly believes that sequestration is bad policy, and that Congress can and should take action to avoid it by passing a comprehensive and balanced deficit reduction package.It was mind boggling to see the extent of the cuts included. The OMB has predicted that under sequestration, the EPA will be cut by $716 million in 2013. (The EPA budget that was enacted in fiscal year 2012, as per the most recently available data, was $8.449 billion.)I discussed the ripple effects of automatic spending cuts with Jessica Goad, from the Center for American Progress. She pointed to the possible closure of National Parks; an impact on the NOAA's National Weather Service forecasting service -- of particular importance with the recent spate of extreme weather; the impeding of regulations on the books defining standards for clean air and water designed to protect the public health. Goad noted, ""It shows why government is important to the environment.""Stats from a fact sheet Goad forwarded me compiled by members of the environmental community included the following items of concern:• Clean Water: Under sequestration, contaminated waters will pose a substantial threat to the public health. • EPA Research: Original scientific research will be cut. This would include studies conducted to determine pollution levels that affect public health and analysis examining potential environmental connections to autism, asthma and toxins, as well as actions monitoring the effects of oil and gas drilling to hazardous air pollutants that EPA is regulating under the CAA, and safety assessment of pesticides, consumer products, and chemicals-- especially those of new technologies. (Industry is not required to test for health hazards). • Impact to Renewable Energy: OMB predicts a cut of $148 million to the Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program. I checked in with Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del) who, as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, has been proactive on clean air laws, climate change awareness and other top environmental concerns. Via email, he shared his thoughts on the fiscal cliff and the environmental agenda. He wrote: Congress and the president must work together to prevent harmful cuts to vital programs and to prevent drastic tax increases for all Americans from taking effect. I am encouraged that President Obama and Congressional leaders are engaging in negotiations to try to reach consensus on a plan that would avoid the so-called ""fiscal cliff"" that many economists believe would throw our country back into recession. I believe we need to stop kicking the can down the road and come to the table together in good faith, roll up our sleeves and show the world that we are still capable of solving big problems. If we don't, we will see serious repercussions not only in our pocketbooks -- but also in our efforts to protect the environment. Such drastic spending cuts threaten to reduce the government's ability to enforce environmental regulations and may limit our ability to invest in new green technologies. Funding decreases to these programs would not only hurt our economy and environment today, but would also be detrimental to what we pass on to future generations. We have made important steps toward protecting our environment over the past several years, and we must continue to work together to maintain these vital programs. That's why we must avert the ""fiscal cliff"" and do what's right for our nation now and for decades to come.Big problems deserve big answers. Let's hope Sen. Carper's Congressional colleagues are in agreement, and don't toss our children's environmental legacy off the cliff.This article originally appeared on the website Moms Clean Air Force.Tell The Senate To Pass Stronger Toxic Standards."
