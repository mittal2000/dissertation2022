Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Hillary and Bill Clinton earned roughly $141 million and paid nearly $44 million in federal income taxes from 2007 to 2014, according to tax returns released Friday.The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate released the tax returns on her campaign website, along with her health records and a list of paid speeches she and her husband gave. According to the returns, the Clintons earned $140,937,785 over the eight year span, primarily from book sales and speaking fees. The couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes and $13,625,777 in state and local taxes, and made $14,959,450 in charitable contributions during that time.Last year, the Clintons paid an effective federal tax rate of 35.7 percent and donated over 10 percent of their income to charity.""We’ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children’s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas—and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,"" Clinton said in a statement accompanying the returns. ""I want more Americans to have the chance to work hard and get ahead, just like we did. And reforming the tax code can help.""The Clintons have previously released their tax returns dating back to 1977.Clinton's release comes about one month after Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush released 33 years of returns, showing his net worth between $19 and $22 million. Bush paid an effective tax rate of roughly 36 percent over those three decades.In May, Hillary Clinton filed a disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission showing the couple had earned approximately $30 million from book sales and speeches in 2014 and the first four months of 2015."

It was one of the deadliest mass killings at a house of worship, and the most recent one until the June 17 church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.To commemorate the tragedy, Sikhs in 14 cities around the country are hosting community service projects this weekend. They hope to send a message of love and community solidarity even in the face of hate.""What happened [in Wisconsin] was a tragedy, but Sikhism is always about moving forward,"" J.D. Singh, who is organizing one such event in New York City, told The Huffington Post. ""So where on one side we have this tragedy, we're taking that energy and turning it into a positive.""The National Day of Seva is celebrated on the first weekend of August each year. The Sikh Coalition, a volunteer organization that focuses on civil and human rights for the Sikh community, started the tradition in 2013 to mark the one-year anniversary of the Oak Creek shooting. ""Seva,"" a Sanskrit word for ""community service,"" embodies a fundamental tenet of the Sikh faith. The Guru Granth Sahib, the religion's central text, states: ""There can be no worship without performing good deeds.""Seventeen service events are scheduled in 14 U.S. cities, and include projects like serving meals to the homeless, reading books to children and cleaning nature trails.Singh, who works for the Manhattan Sikh Association, is organizing a cleanup at Morningside Park in the Harlem neighborhood. The event is in its third year and is expected to draw at least 100 volunteers from Sikh and non-Sikh communities in and around New York City.The cleanup will involve cleaning and weeding, as well as planting flowers and beautifying the park. Asked whether a service project of this nature can serve in place of a memorial, Singh admitted that he had been unsure at first.""After the first year, I was very curious as to what peoples' thought process was around this. Would they have preferred something more somber?"" he reflected. But the response was ""overwhelmingly positive.""""It's a really great feeling at the end of the day -- you're exhausted, you're filthy, but you see what you've done to make this park become beautiful,"" Singh added.Jasvir Singh, a Michigan Sikh Coalition ambassador and no relation to J.D., is coordinating a food packing project for the Day of Seva on Saturday. His Detroit-area Sikh community is teaming up with Kids Against Hunger, a humanitarian organization that sends nutritious meal packages to hungry families in the U.S. and in developing nations. Singh says he expects between 80 and 100 volunteers to show up to the Sterling Heights Gurdwara, where they will measure servings and pack roughly 10,000 meals.The Michigan event builds on another tenet of Sikhism, the principle of langar or food service. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, established the practice by offering free food to anybody who needed it.""It's a big part of our community to help and feed others who are hungry,"" Jasvir Singh told HuffPost. ""Helping organizations who bring meals to the table of the needy is something that is really in line with our thought process, too.""That resolve remains strong, he said, even in the wake of tragedies like the Oak Creek shooting.""One of the concepts we have in our religion is ... staying in high spirits,"" Singh explained. ""Regardless of what the situation is, we need to always spread love and peace and keep helping each other. There will be people who will be ignorant or hate others, but we can't let that get the better of us.""Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said this week that he opposes open borders -- more a hypothetical than an actual policy proposal -- no one was shocked. The Democratic presidential candidate supported comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 and favors a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but he's long been skeptical of guest worker programs and other legal immigration that could squeeze out American workers.Some immigration advocates, however, said they were surprised Sanders quickly went from talking about open borders to saying he doesn't want immigrants to take American jobs. Sanders has insisted he was speaking about open borders, something no candidate is pushing, but also repeated his concern that businesses want to bring foreign workers to the U.S. to take American jobs.""Those are the talking points that Republicans use to drive a wedge between Latinos and the African-American vote, saying, 'They're coming to take your jobs.' That at its core does not resonate and does not set him apart from the Republican Party,"" said Greisa Martinez, advocacy coordinator for United We Dream, a group led by undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Sanders' immigration policy stances are generally in step with advocacy groups. But as he struggles to win over minority voters, his tone matters. Some advocates said they have concerns that his opposition to new immigrant workers disrespects immigrants as a whole.FWD.us, the Mark Zuckerberg-backed group that advocates for immigration reform, was the first organization to criticize Sanders for his remarks to Vox. Todd Schulte, the group's executive director, wrote Wednesday that Sanders ""falsely pits immigrants as an obstacle to tackling unemployment."" He called that view ""troubling,"" and noted that studies have found immigration boosts the economy.Sanders often says giving undocumented immigrants legal status would aid the economy, but his comments on new immigrants tend to hinge more on the idea of Americans losing their jobs -- to the chagrin of some advocates.""There's just overwhelming information about how immigrants contribute to our economy and to our communities, and that's something that should be part of the conversation instead of the frame of mind that immigrants can take jobs, which is incorrect,"" said Lizet Ocampo, associate director for immigration at the Center for American Progress, which has analyzed economic benefits of immigration reform.Sanders' skepticism about expanding legal immigration, particularly guest worker programs, reflects a broader tension within the immigrant rights movement that long separated organized labor and allies like Sanders from other center-left and business community stakeholders. In 2007, Sanders and labor allies in the Senate voted against a bipartisan immigration reform bill, which they said expanded guest worker programs without adequate protections for American workers.More recently, the labor-backed wing of the reform movement has found ways to overcome its misgivings about increasing guest worker programs for the sake of passing comprehensive immigration reform. Sanders joined major labor unions in lending support to increases in the guest worker program as part of the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill in exchange for promises of new protections against exploitation. Sanders also secured $1.5 billion for youth job training.To many observers, Sanders’ 2013 vote shows current differences are matters of tone, not substance.“Abstractly,” Sanders, like organized labor, “would prefer no guest worker programs,” said Harley Shaiken, an organized labor expert at the University of California, Berkeley. “They have shown a willingness to accept some kind of guest worker programs as the price of admission to comprehensive reform, meaning the participation of the business community.”Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, said Sanders’ remarks reflect a divide -- not among progressive reform advocates, but between progressives and business-backed groups like FWD.us. He called the FWD.us criticism of Sanders “hyperbole” aimed at silencing questions about guest worker programs pushed by big business. FWD.us founder Mark Zuckerberg also is founder and CEO of Facebook, which Costa notes lobbied Congress for a larger, more lenient H-1B visa guest worker program in 2013.“The corporate view of immigration has had a public relations victory,” Costa said. “They have tied immigration reform with what they want, which is expanded and deregulated guest worker programs. There is a left view and a more corporate view that is being mistaken for the left view sometimes.”Costa noted that other reform groups share Sanders’ concerns and support attempts to insure protections against exploitation of foreign workers, but have sometimes disagreed about how much to compromise in order to achieve comprehensive reform.Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America's Voice, said Sanders is part of a spectrum on the pro-immigration reform side, which ranges from those who think legal immigration is good to keep up with the labor market, to those who say it could hurt American jobs.But in the end, they agree on the need for comprehensive immigration reform.The 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill that Sanders supported ""had a pretty significant expansion of legal immigration,""Sharry said. ""So to call him some troglodyte who doesn't get it and wants to keep them all out -- that's just not true."" Neither United We Dream nor FWD.us discounted Sanders as an ally, even as they questioned his recent comments.""We're thankful for the senator's support for the bill in 2013, but we want to make sure that we are laying the foundation for success in the future, and really hope that moving forward -- to be a strong ally -- he will reconsider his debunked falsehoods about immigrants taking jobs from Americans and depressing wages,"" FWD.us’s Schulte said in an email on Friday. The AFL-CIO wouldn't comment directly on Sanders’ remarks, instead emphasizing its commitment to comprehensive immigration reform. Sanders and the other major Democratic presidential candidates, as well as Republican hopeful Mike Huckabee, spoke to top organized labor officials at the AFL-CIO’s executive council meeting earlier this week in an attempt to win the labor federation’s endorsement. ""The AFL-CIO’s position on the need for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship is clear,"" Amaya Smith, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO, said in an email.

4,POLITICS,Lawmakers Call For Investigation Into DOJ's Continued Crackdown On Medical Marijuana,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawmakers-call-for-investigation-into-dojs-continued-crackdown-of-medical-marijuana_us_55bba4f4e4b0d4f33a0296ab,"The Justice Department may be in violation of the law, congressmen say.",2015-07-31,California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom at the 2014 California State Democratic convention,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559d6dcc1a00005c0024c04c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Two congressmen behind a federal provision protecting state-legal medical marijuana operations are seeking an investigation into the Department of Justice's continued crackdown on medical marijuana patients and providers, saying the DOJ may be in violation of federal law.""We request that you immediately investigate the Department's expenditure of funds to continue prosecuting these cases, which we believe are in direct violation of the prohibition on such expenditures established by Rohrabacher-Farr,"" reads the letter, addressed to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz from Reps. Sam Farr (D-Calif.) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.). Rohrabacher and Farr's amendment, which blocks the Justice Department from using funds to undermine state-legal medical marijuana programs, found support in Congress and ultimately made it into the final federal spending bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in December. As the marijuana provision is part of an annual funding bill that will expire, the lawmakers introduced an identical version again in June, which was reauthorized by the House of Representatives. Despite last year's provision becoming law, ""the Department has continued to pursue and prosecute individuals and businesses for involvement with medical marijuana in states where it is legal despite the clear direction in the law to forswear such activities,"" the lawmakers wrote Thursday.DOJ spokesman Patrick Rodenbush laid out the department's justification for doing so earlier this year, telling the Los Angeles Times that the marijuana protections only stop the department from ""impeding the ability of states to carry out their medical marijuana laws,"" and that the DOJ didn't ""expect that the amendment will impact our ability to prosecute private individuals or private entities who are violating the Controlled Substances Act.” But in Thursday's letter, the congressmen blast Rodenbush's position on the matter.""Mr. Rodenbush's interpretation is clearly a stretch,"" the letter reads. ""The implementation of state law is carried out by individuals and businesses as the state authorizes them to do. For DOJ to argue otherwise is a tortuous twisting of the text ... and common sense.""Any DOJ official who interprets their provision differently is ""doing so knowingly and willfully, without regard for the facts,"" the congressmen argue, adding that the continued use of federal funds to prevent individuals or businesses who are compliant with their state laws is ""clearly a violation"" of their provision.Although the DOJ has slowed its crackdown on medical marijuana recently, it continues to target some dispensaries and patients. Earlier this year, Farr and Rohrabacher, along with Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), wrote a letter publicly condemning the DOJ for trying to shutter the Oakland, California-based Harborside Health Center -- widely considered to be the largest and one of the most well-respected medical marijuana dispensaries in the nation.In Washington state last year, the DOJ went after a family of medical marijuana patients who have maintained they were growing more than 70 medical marijuana plants for their own personal medical use near their rural home in Kettle Falls.Citing these and other cases in their letter, Rohrabacher and Farr argue the DOJ has overstepped its bounds ""spending dollars it does not have the legal authority to spend.""A spokesman for the DOJ inspector general's office acknowledged that the letter was received and said that the office will respond to the congressmen after reviewing it. DOJ spokesman Rodenbush declined a Huffington Post request for comment. To date, 23 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes, and an additional 17 have legalized limited medical use of nonpsychoactive cannabis extracts, which are often used to treat children with severe epilepsy. Four states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. Under the Obama administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several U.S. attorneys have raided marijuana dispensaries and sent people to prison, even though they complied with state laws. According to a 2013 report released by advocacy group Americans for Safe Access, the Obama administration has spent nearly $80 million each year -- more than $200,000 per day -- cracking down on medical marijuana.Meanwhile, the American public overwhelmingly support the use of medical marijuana: A 2014 CBS News poll found 86 percent of Americans believe doctors should be able to prescribe marijuana to their patients.Despite the public's support and congressional amendment's protections, the federal government continues to classify the plant among the most ""dangerous"" substances, alongside heroin and LSD, with ""no currently accepted medical use.""Read the full letter below:Also on HuffPost:"

But a new DNA study shows that we've gotten these cunning canines all wrong.According to the study, the animals are distinct species -- and the African ""jackals"" aren't jackals at all but wolves. Dubbed Canis anthus, or the African golden wolf, this is the first new species of canid -- the biological family that includes dogs, wolves, coyotes, as well as jackals -- discovered in Africa in 150 years.""Consistent with two previous studies also based on mitochondrial sequences, we find that golden jackals from Africa and Eurasia are not each other’s closest relative as we would expect if they were the same species,"" Dr. Klaus-Peter Koepfli, a researcher at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., and the study's lead author, told The Guardian.(Story continues below.)For the study, the researchers derived the evolutionary history of both the African and Eurasian animals by analyzing golden jackal DNA samples and extensive genomic data in both the jackals and gray wolves.They noticed that African golden jackals (now considered to be the African golden wolf) split from their gray wolf and coyote ancestors around 1.3 million years ago. Eurasian golden jackals diverged some 600,000 years earlier -- and the two species’ mitochondrial DNA differs by up to 6.7 percent, Science magazine reported.""One of the main takeaways of our study is that even among well-known and widespread species such as golden jackals, there is the potential to discover hidden biodiversity and that such discoveries are made even more possible by using data sampled from whole genomes,"" Koepli told Reuters.The researchers think that scientists previously mistook African and Eurasian golden jackals for the same species because they shared many physical traits, including the shapes of their skulls and teeth.That sounds reasonable, but not all scientists are convinced.Previous research by Dr. Philippe Gaubert, a biologist at the University of Montpellier in France suggested that African golden jackals are a subspecies of gray wolf that's separate from the Eurasian jackal. He told National Geographic that he stands by his original work -- and isn't yet convinced that the African golden wolf is a new species.""There's still a lot of work to be done,"" he said.But Dr. Greger Larson, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Oxford in England, voiced his support of the scientists behind the new study.""They have phenomenal data and they do a nice series of analyses,"" he told National Geographic. ""It's a super airtight case.""The study was published online in the journal Current Biology on July 30, 2015."

""For too long our justice system has reinforced our country’s cruel history of racism and economic inequality -- remaining disconnected from our founding ideals of life, liberty, and equal treatment under the law.""(Read the entire plan below.)The proposals come amid a growing nationwide debate on criminal justice reform, which has forced both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates to take notice. In recent months, the discussion has centered heavily on issues of race and policing amid a string of high-profile police killings of unarmed black men. O'Malley's plan specifically calls for ensuring transparency and accountability in law enforcement by mandating and expanding data reporting on police-involved shootings and deaths, establishing national guidelines on the use of force, enacting racial bias training and crisis de-escalation training, and continuing to develop programs for police body cameras and other recording devices.Speaking Friday alongside presidential candidates from both parties at the National Urban League Conference in Fort Lauderdale, O'Malley again dove into a discussion on criminal justice reform. He brought up his record as governor and mayor of Baltimore before that -- a legacy that attracted scrutiny amid unrest in Baltimore earlier this year -- and spoke of his work to rectify racial disparities in prison populations and sentencing. He also admitted there is still plenty of work left to do.“We are not there yet. Every headline or video of official abuse, injustice, indifference, killing or murder reminds us of how far we still have to go,” said O’Malley.Critics tore into O'Malley earlier this month when a group of black activists interrupted an appearance at the progressive Netroots Nation conference, and he responded by saying ""all lives matter."" The phrase has frequently been used by detractors of the Black Lives Matter movement -- and also led to criticism of Hillary Clinton when she said it in June. O'Malley later apologized for his choice of words, saying that he meant no disrespect.On Friday, O'Malley didn't repeat the mistake.""Every year we buried 300 young black men who died violent deaths on our streets,"" he said of the murder rate during the beginning of his tenure as mayor of Baltimore. ""And black lives matter.""Democratic frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have also become increasingly outspoken about criminal justice reform and its racial implications, as they seek a balance that will allow them to champion racial equality while not risking the support of working-class white voters.O’Malley has yet to make a surge in the Democratic primary following the announcement of his candidacy earlier this summer. According to HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates publicly available polling data, he has the support of 0.5 percent of likely Democratic voters, trailing all other candidates except for former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. Clinton leads the pack with 56.9 percent, with Sanders a distant second at 18.5 percent.Read O'Malley's entire plan below:"

8,IMPACT,"In His Own Words, Iraq and Afghanistan Vet Recounts Journey From Homelessness To Hope",Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/homeless-veteran-housing_us_55b7dba4e4b0074ba5a68985,There's help out there for homeless veterans. They just need to know where to find it.,2015-07-30,<p>Craig Hinds when he was an E-3 hospital corpsman in the U.S. Navy. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7dfcd1400002f002e11c3.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"There were over 67,000 homeless United States military veterans in 2011. Craig Hinds -- who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq -- was one of them.But in 2012, Hinds, now 37, found a place to live: the Jericho Project's veterans-only Kingsbridge Terrace apartment building in the Bronx, a borough of New York City. The Jericho Project -- an organization dedicated largely to housing homeless vets -- offers what's called supportive housing: Residents pay a third of their income (or veteran's benefits) towards rent, and are offered in-house employment and substance abuse counseling, among other services. The Jericho Project gets its funding from a mix of public and private sources, and the group says that less than 10 percent of its buildings' residents relapse back into homelessness. As New York City, like cities across the country, tries to end veteran homelessness by the end of this year, organizations like the Jericho Project play an integral part. Here, in his own words, is how Craig Hinds says he became homeless, found the Jericho Project and started putting his life back together. I joined the military in 2005. The United States Navy. I did four years. Got out in 2009. Did two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. I had two jobs. I was a hospital corpsman -- which is the equivalent of a medical assistant -- and I was also a pharmacy technician.I dealt with the ground troops. A lot of people don’t know this about the military. The Marines and Navy are actually one. The Marines is the ground troops, and the Navy is the water troops, and we’re together. The Marines don’t have medical, so we treat the Marines.It was very traumatic. The things that I’ve seen, I don’t want to even describe. The thing -- when you see something in the head, you can’t control it. For example, you see something, I’m trained to take care of it, but later on you might dream about it, you might think about it later -- the mind plays tricks on you. Especially if you see it again, it might startle you or scare you or give you some anxiety.So I had a lot of nightmares. I saw a lot of things I didn’t want to see. It would be playing in my head. You can’t say stop.When I got out in 2009, that’s when I had a lot of difficulties. That’s when I had a real reality check, coming out of the military into -- well, we call it the civilian world, but from the military to the real world, it’s a crash course, it’s really different.For example, to get into the military, they take you away from everyone and everybody and they program you. You know what I mean? Boot camp, no phones, no nothing. This is what it takes to be a soldier. They take away what it’s like to be a normal person, a civilian, they want you a certain way, they train you that way. Unfortunately, when it’s time to leave, they don’t train you to be a regular person. You still come out of the military military-minded, used to the military standards and military structure, so when you come out, it’s not as structured out there so it takes a real adjustment period, and it’s really hard finding resources. You ask five people the same question, you get five different answers.I had huge difficulties in Atlanta. I don’t know if it’s a South thing or what. I went back to live with my mother, because coming out, I had a little bit of money saved up, but I wanted to get all my benefits and everything that I was told I deserved or earned. So when I came out in Atlanta, they only have one or two [Veteran’s Affairs] hospitals in the whole state, so every time I would try to apply for benefits or try to apply for health care or anything, there would be so many people they would send you back and say come back the next day. It was extremely discouraging, and especially without a mass transit system, it’s almost impossible to get around, so I used a lot of my money and resources just trying to get benefits that I never got in Atlanta. Atlanta was a shock, because I just came back and --- I feel like veterans should be treated a certain way. What they go through and what they’ve done. A lot of times when we come out of the military we already have a lot of PTSD, a lot of unresolved issues. You come expecting open arms. I didn’t find that in Atlanta.I lived with my mom, and after a while I wasn’t able to help and she’s like, ""What are you gonna do?"" So I decided to move back to New York. I spoke to my grandmother, and she said I could come stay. I moved to New York in September 2010. I came up here with my grandmother, she lives in Mt. Vernon [in the Bronx.] The Bronx VA is the closest one. Actually I got a lot of help at the Bronx VA, a lot of assistance from the people there. They seemed to be more understanding, more patient. I was able to apply for my benefits, and lucky for me, I bumped into someone I knew from boot camp who worked at the hospital who helped me navigate through certain things. By the time I applied for my compensation, I started going to my routine visits, as far as seeing my primary care doctor, my psychiatrist.My compensation still hadn’t kicked in yet, because the VA’s really backed up. It took a while. My grandmother grew a little impatient with the process. Unfortunately at that time, I found myself homeless. I bounced to a shelter, but a good shelter was Borden Avenue, an all-veterans shelter. Luckily, my friend directed me there. And that was a big help because it was all veterans.Being that it was all veterans, there was a certain camaraderie. Even if we’re in different branches -- Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines -- when we come out we have a certain camaraderie because we all come out and hit the same reality. Borden was a little more comfortable because it was all veterans and because I had my own little cubicle space which helped a lot.  A lot of people think when they hear homeless veteran, they think of some old Vietnam dude who’s an alcoholic but no, I was only 34. There was a lot of people a little bit younger, a little bit older than me. There’s no age group for it. There’s no age, there’s no race, it affects all of us who come out of the military. It’s not an old people thing, it’s a military thing. It’s an adjustment. It’s a hard adjustment from there to here. It’s hard to find resources when you come out. There’s not one place where you can go and get everything. A lot of people end up in bad situations just trying to get their compensation, which takes over a year. A lot of times the VA is backed up. I had to deal with [substance abuse], but not my own. I had to deal with other people’s, but I didn’t have alcohol [problems], thank God, but I see how it could happen, because you get out and you’re like, ""Dang,’""and if you hang out with the wrong people, they’ll say, ""Take this, relax,"" and then it becomes a habit. And then every day you’re drinking. It’s kind of a Band Aid for us. A lot of us need therapy, a lot of us need to talk it out. In the process between getting out and being able to talk to somebody, that’s when people fall into the substance abuse. Dealing with the not knowing. Sometimes you might live with a family member. They might kick you out. Different traumas might cause people to substance abuse, and I’ve seen that.[Walking around, knowing you’re going to a shelter that night] is depressing. It’s depressing. It is. And often times: ""How’d I get here? How’d I end up here."" But it’s very depressing. But the good thing about [Borden Avenue shelter] is they help you find housing, which is good, so you have a little bit of hope. It’s not like ""Oh this is a dead end."" So they do help you. You have a little bit of hope, but it’s still depressing.I had a friend at the VA, and he introduced me to a woman named Brenda, who works with housing and Section 8, and that’s how I found out about [the Jericho Project.]She gave me the phone number for Jericho and the address. I had to call, and after making a million calls, I finally got somebody and they set me up with an interview.[The first night at Jericho], I couldn’t sleep. I was so excited. It was such a shock: beds, furniture. It was much nicer than I expected. I was in shock. I was like, ""This is mine?"" It was a brand-new building. Brand-new furniture. Everything was fresh and new. A fresh new start in my life. I felt like I was finally getting a chance to get myself together, and I did.I mean, living here is amazing. We have a computer room, a laundry room, all here in the basement, a TV room, a multipurpose room. We have counselors we can see all day, as needed, we have employment specialists who help us with jobs, job interviews. If you need a resume, they help us do a resume. I believe you can do anything you want to here because you have staff that can help no matter what you want to do. I never went to anybody here and said, “I need help, I need something,” and they’re not able to do it. Everyone is open arms and willing to assist you. When you come in here, you’re pretty low. You really build your confidence up. You start building up self-worth. You learn how to manage yourself again. You pay your bills. You pay rent, which is based on 30 percent of your income [or VA compensation.] You’re feeding yourself, so you learn how to be independent again. You can build yourself up in so many ways. I didn’t realize how much confidence had a big part to play with it, but I can see as my confidence changed, as I built it up, that everything is working out better.The facilities with what they have gives me structure. You can’t have outside individuals running inside and outside of the building, so it’s very, very low on distractions. It’s very good for structure.I meditate twice a day: first thing in the morning and then 3 or 4 in the afternoon. You can do it by yourself, but it also feels better to do it with other people. They have [transcendental meditation] classes at Jericho. They give you a word called a mantra which nobody can know. You repeat it to yourself in your head, and you do that for 20 minutes. You close your eyes, sit in a chair, you say the mantra for 20 minutes and during that period, you release stress and you release things out of the body that feel weird.It definitely calms me down. It definitely gives me a peaceful state of mind, a peaceful place. I’m able to think clearer, sleep better, and I’m a more happy person, which is what I wanted. I love it.It makes me really peaceful. It gives me space -- whereas before I would just react. I don’t react as much.The best feeling is to help someone accomplish their goal. For example, I have a friend Anthony, who had no job, no direction, and I said, do this and do that, and he got a job! He got himself together. He’s cleaned himself up, start dressing better, and I was like, ""Wow, I like doing this."" So I changed my major to psychology because I really want to help people. I want to talk to them, find out what’s going on, find out how I can help. I think I have a gift for that, and I realized that moving in here, just dealing with a lot of residents.I’m not using the GI Bill, but I’m using vocational rehabilitation, which is another military tuition assistance program, [to go to Touro College].I don’t think it’d be best to leave [Jericho] until you're totally where you want to be, anybody out there. I think if you come in you need to set a goal, you need to get a job, and once you reach that goal I think you should leave because it leaves the door open for other people because there’s always going to be homeless veterans. But I don’t think you should leave until you got what you needed for you to be totally independent and successful -- on your own in every way.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

9,POLITICS,Rick Perry In A Harrowing Position As First Debate Nears,"Patrick Svitek, Texas Tribune",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-perry-gop-debate_us_55ba76f5e4b0d4f33a01f827,Will he make the cut?,2015-07-30,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"By Patrick Svitek, The Texas TribuneRick Perry has had a good July, all things considered.The former governor and Republican presidential candidate earned plaudits for delivering thoughtful speeches on financial reform and race relations, seized the opportunity to tussle with bombastic foe Donald Trump and parted ways with half of the abuse-of-power indictment hanging over him.Yet his national polling remains stuck in the low single digits, numbers that in any other presidential election cycle could be shrugged off by a campaign as irrelevant this early in the process. This time around, they mean Perry is on the cusp of eligibility for his party's first official debate, a harrowing position for any candidate.For Perry especially, the polling could endanger his highest-profile opportunity yet to show off what he has been telling everyone who will listen over the past several months: He is not the Rick Perry of the 2012 race. That Rick Perry, he has argued, was altogether unready for the rigors of a presidential campaign, not the least of which were the debates.With a week to go, Perry's team is confident he won't miss the opportunity.""Number one, we fully expect to be on the debate stage,"" Perry campaign manager Jeff Miller said Wednesday. ""Number two, when people see the governor on the debate stage, they’re going to be incredibly impressed.”On Thursday, Perry's debate berth continued to hang in the balance. Fox News, which is hosting the Aug. 6 event in Cleveland, has said it will base eligibility on whoever is in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls as of 4 p.m. Tuesday. A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday — a poll expected to be included in the network's calculations — left Perry in 11th place in The Washington Post's running estimate of which candidates would qualify.""He is right on the bubble,"" Quinnipiac pollster Tim Malloy said of Perry. ""I think he's a man who wants redemption. He's definitely done his homework to get ready for this.""If Perry does not make the cut, he will be able to participate in a forum earlier that day in Cleveland with other candidates who did not crack the top 10. Unlike some lower-tier hopefuls, Perry has declined to criticize the debate criteria (former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania) or make it a rallying point for supporters (former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina).""You know, rules are rules,"" Perry said last month on MSNBC. ""I know how to play by the rules.""The debate criteria has already scrambled the dynamics of the GOP contest, forcing some candidates to prioritize growing their national profile earlier than usual. A group of pro-Perry super PACs is spending $1 million on a cross-country ad campaign, hoping to boost his national standing ahead of the first debate.""That’s one of the reasons we’re doing it, but it’s not the only reason,"" said Austin Barbour, a senior adviser to the super PACs. ""I feel like we’re in this thing for the long run.""As for the first debate, Barbour said he views it as just one opportunity out of many for Perry to connect with voters, particularly in early-voting Iowa, over the next several months. ""It's not life or death if he's not up there,"" Barbour added.Perry's also looked to nudge up his national poll numbers with a steady stream of cable TV appearances, most of them on Fox News. Perry, whose campaign recently added former Fox News producer Lexi Stemple, has appeared 24 times on Fox News since he launched his campaign, fourth among his GOP rivals, according to a tally released Tuesday to Politico.The other Texan running for president, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, appears to be a safe bet for the first debate, placing eighth in the Washington Post's analysis.Wherever the candidates wind up next week, South Carolina GOP chairman Matt Moore said he is not jumping to conclusions about any candidate's viability.""I don't write off any candidates who are on the stage or not at this point,"" said Moore, who as a state Republican Party chairman is neutral in the primary. ""I do think that if Gov. Perry's on stage, he'll be vastly improved from the previous election cycle.""Moore alluded to some of the recent attention Perry has been receiving, including for a speech he gave this month that offered a frank assessment of the GOP's history with black voters. Perry delivered another meaty speech Wednesday in which he pitched a host of Wall Street reforms while linking the 2008 financial crisis to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.""I expect him to shine"" on the debate stage, Moore said of Perry. ""He very recently has found his voice.""Perry's campaign was keeping quiet this week about how he was gearing up for the first debate, assuming he makes it. The former governor, however, has been open about his presidential preparation over the past several months, touting his participation in wonky policy briefings and frequent trips to the early-voting states.If he qualifies for the first debate, Perry is all but guaranteed to have to contend with Trump, currently the national front-runner for the Republican nomination. The real estate mogul has relentlessly mocked Perry as weak on border security, criticism the former governor has returned with a call for Trump to leave the race over an attack on U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and a speech eviscerating Trump as a ""cancer on conservatism.""While there is no doubt potential for fireworks between the two — on Wednesday alone Perry challenged Trump to a pull-up contest — Miller said the former governor's team is not sweating the radioactive businessman in the run-up to the first debate. In fact, Miller added, ""we look forward to it.""The Texas Tribune is a nonpartisan, nonprofit media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them – about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.Also on HuffPost:"
