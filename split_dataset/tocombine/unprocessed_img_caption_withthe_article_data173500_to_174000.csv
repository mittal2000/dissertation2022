Ä. 1532 in Regensburg Category:Martin Luther by Cranach Category:Portrait paintings with grey background ... ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badca312000009900ff1cbd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a junior at Morehouse College, I was first introduced to a German monk by the name of Martin Luther in Roland Bainton's autobiography Here I Stand. I was enthralled by his volatile stand against the abuses of the Roman Catholic Church.The day was All Hallow's Eve, the precursor to what we celebrate as Halloween. Luther knew that on this day the villagers, students and fellow college faculty would file through those church doors for a special mass and that, while entering, some would stop to read his pastoral thoughts on problems in the church at large. Luther wasn't the first to post things in this manner. Back then, church doors were commonly used as community bulletin board of sorts.October 31st will be the 495th anniversary of Luther's posting his 95 Theses on the doors of Wittenberg's Castle Church, and event that sparked what we know as the Protestant Reformation. But at the genesis of this history-shaping, Jesus-focused revolution was one man, one pastor who simply saw something wrong and offered a solution. He was a man who believed that every once in a while; something is so bad that you simply can't stay silent. Sometimes you have to speak up. As Martin Luther King, Jr. affirms that ""Cowardice asks the question 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question 'Is it political?' But conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor political, nor popular but because conscience tells one it is right.""For Luther as found in the 95 Theses it was on the issue of indulgences. Church officials sold indulgences, claiming they set sinful souls free from purgatory and into the arms of Christ, and used the money to build fancy digs such as St. Peter's basilica. Luther's convictions reinforced with his Lectures on Psalms and Lectures on Romans developed his emerging theology that was articulated in the 95 Theses.I do believe that the true gospel for Luther and motivation for his stance was this: We're too broken and messed up to stand in God's presence, but God makes us worthy to walk in his love. We're weak and unable to do what's right, but God, in God's goodness, provided us with power. We don't deserve such gifts, yet God showers us in grace. Most of all, none of it can be earned. Therefore, Christ has claimed it for us through his death on the cross. God does all the work. We reap all the reward, and Jesus gets every ounce of the glory. Salvation is ours, to receive, but it isn't ours to earn. Sola fide. By faith alone. Our right standing with God as members of his family is given to us as a gift; we are passive receivers, not active earners. Later, in his work on the book of Romans, Luther writes: ""Faith is a living, daring confidence in God's grace so sure and certain that the believer would stake his/her life on it a thousand times. This knowledge of and confidence in God's grace makes humanity glad and bold and happy in dealing with God and all other creatures....without compulsion, a person is ready and glad to do good to everyone, to serve everyone, to suffer everything, out of love and praise to God who has shown him his grace.""  Legacy of Martin Luther and African Descent Traditions of FaithThat the faith of our heritage and in God to endure the Middle Passage, the invisible institution of slavery, Jim Crow Laws and present day oppression has sustained us. This experience of faith has not only sustained us or those who are considered of African descent but also those who are Native Americans, Spanish-speaking people, and women, have had this experience. We must affirm that speaking the truth can land us in trouble. Just as Martin Luther after posting his list on the door of his local church and had to appear at hearings and give numerous accounts of all he believed. The pressure weighed on Luther who -- at the Diet of Worms in 1521 -- was told to recant his teachings or face the prospect of death. This was his response: ""Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I can and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience. Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen."" Luther's refusal resulted in his excommunication. He was forced to live in hiding, under the condemnation of popes and emperors, as well as the constant threat of execution at the stake.But a funny thing happens when you stand up and speak the truth. Even if people in charge don't agree, the rest of the world standing near you still hears it. They can believe it. They can join you in sharing it and fighting for it. That's exactly what happened with Martin Luther. Others saw the message he'd rediscovered in the Scriptures and the abuses he noted in the church. Suddenly, what started with a lengthy note from one pastor to a powerful pope became a massive movement championing the message of grace. Though in hiding for most of his remaining years, Luther kept on writing. He saw to it that the truth of Christ made its way into the hands and hearts of everyday people. He went on to translate the entire Bible into German and coordinated a German-language mass, both firsts. His greatest joy was the completion of a catechism -- an overview of Christian doctrine and life -- that was intended to help fathers teach the basics of following Jesus to their children. That same catechism, Luther and others would eventually take from house to house in an effort to personally pastor the people.There are moments in life when you just have to speak up. There are certain moments, certain situations where you think, ""I know someone might be mad or disagree, but I just have to say something!""As African Descent communities of faith, may we welcome those moments when they arise in others. May we pray that those stances of leadership will be in the shaping of future prophetic leaders. May we be people who can't sit still in the face of injustice, error and oversight. Most of all may the unwavering confidence we have in God's grace drive us to do good, loving, selfless, joyous, Jesus-glorifying things. Let it free us to serve our neighbors, share our goods and, when necessary, speak our minds. Why? Because sometimes doing so can change the world."

But what happens when that problem continues to worsen year after year, and leaders are reluctant to speak its name?According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage of workers under the federal poverty line rose to a 20 year high in 2010, the last year analyzed. The number of working poor families in America, many who work multiple jobs, has steadily risen each year since 2005, even before the recession.Still, after three Presidential debates, neither candidate has spoken about how to address this issue. To be fair, Governor Romney has mentioned poverty five times, and President Obama has spoken about those ""who want to climb to the middle class"" without being explicit. But neither took the opportunity to detail how their policy agenda will help the working poor. Thought leaders as diverse as Michael Reagan, the pundit and son of President Ronald Reagan, the USA Today editorial board, and former Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Lynn Woolsey have each expressed surprise or dismay that the working poor are not a part of this campaign's debates.Speaking up for the working poor is not only vital, but it is a winning argument that resonates with a majority of Americans who want to find viable solutions.Ignoring the issue of poverty is a missed opportunity according to new polling commissioned by the American Values Network. In total, 87 percent of voters, a strong majority of respondents across ideological lines, believe the working poor should be a top or important government priority.The next Congress and President will make decisions that could significantly impact these families' income and economic mobility. The survey tested which arguments voters found most compelling in support of policies addressing poverty and for cutting such efforts. When asked to choose between the best argument in support of government initiatives to help struggling families and the best argument for cutting those programs, 58% of respondents found the messages supporting government poverty programs more convincing. Whoever is on Capitol Hill or in the White House after this election should take note.The poll, conducted among 1005 voters nationwide by the Prime Group between September 26-30, also found voters say candidates who address the issue of poverty as more trustworthy and authentic than those who focus solely on the middle class.And we're seeing renewed political interest as American s have come together across the country and online to elevate the discussion of the working poor. Earlier this month, Oxfam joined with Sojourners, World Vision and Bread for the World to launch the documentary film, ""The Line"", to highlight the story of hard working American families doing everything right but still struggling in poverty. We could never have imagined the response: over 2,000 screenings in churches, community centers and homes in every state in the union, attended by tens of thousands of people since the film premiered Oct 2. People have gathered to talk about growing poverty in our communities and start a conversation they do not see their leaders having. You can still sign up at http://thelinemovie.com/ to host a screening and join the conversation.At the film's premiere, Rev. Jim Wallis encouraged a crowd of 400 in DC plus online viewers to encourage our Presidential candidates to #TalkPoverty and take the conversation to social media. The Half in Ten Campaign has spearheaded the response by grassroots communities who have used Twitter to ask our leaders to discuss their plans for addressing poverty. In 24 hours after the second Presidential debate, these messages reached over 700,000 followers.Americans care about these issues and they are not afraid to act. But will our leaders listen?

2,ENVIRONMENT,"Climate Change Sandy Says to US, 'Take That, Idiots!'","Nathan Currier, Contributor
composer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change_us_5bb124b2e4b09bbe9a5b7a16,We might as well keep it simple and just say this superstorm is caused by our human-made climate change.,2012-10-28,"In this image taken by NOAA's GOES East at 2:45 GMT on Friday, Oct. 26, 2012, Hurricane Sandy is seen in the center bottom. The hurricane has killed at least 20 people in the Caribbean, and just left the Bahamas. It is expected to move north, just off the Eastern Seaboard. When Hurricane Sandy becomes a hybrid weather monster some call ""Frankenstorm"" it will smack the East Coast harder and wider than last year's damaging Irene, forecasters said Friday. (AP Photo/NOAA)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb124b21f0000df002330ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After the second presidential debate, moderator Candy Crowley said, ""Climate change -- I had that question, all you climate change people. We just -- you know, again, we knew that the economy was still the main thing, so you knew you kind of wanted to go with the economy."" And the media's been talking about low information voters? Now, along comes Sandy, who says to Candy, ""Okay, then, take that!"" See, Sandy doesn't get into debating these things, either. Now, let's see what Sandy's bill ends up being -- anyone taking bets? -- then let's sit down and talk some economy. In fact, there's an idea: Maybe a new American pastime could be organized 'disaster gambling,' with states collecting revenue as everyone bets on the tab for each new upcoming climate change disaster in their respective states? Perhaps some still take issue with the suggestion that a superstorm like this is caused by our human-engendered climate change. But cigarette packages say things like, ""cigarettes cause fatal lung disease."" This, of course, is just shorthand, a monumental simplification, because in fact causation in complex systems is always a vastly complicated affair, and tobacco companies spent lots of money blowing smoke in the face of all that complexity: but the likelihood of getting lung disease is so greatly increased by smoking that eventually they gave up and we all agreed to go 'low-info' by just saying cigarettes cause fatal lung disease. As I'll demonstrate, in much the same way, we might as well keep it simple and just say this superstorm is caused by our human-made climate change. I've been writing on the Arctic crisis, and in a recent long list of immediate physical changes from loss of summer Arctic sea ice, I listed (as #12) its potential impacts on weather at lower latitudes. It so happens that it is just at this time of year that this has the clearest line of causation, since lots of heat and moisture enter the atmosphere from the open waters that had been ice covered, and latent heat is released in the refreezing process, which progresses rapidly as the Arctic cools down right around now. Dr. Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University, whose work was featured on the front page of the New York Times earlier this year, wrote in a recent paper (with Stephen Vavrus), ""This warming is clearly observable during autumn in near-surface air temperature anomalies in proximity to the areas of ice loss.""And this in turn becomes very important for large-scale atmospheric circulation. For example, Dr. Francis has used the metaphor of a river going down a steep incline, which runs straight, versus a river that runs along a flat plain, which tends to meander. Likewise the jet stream, since the normal energy gradient between Arctic air and that of lower latitudes has become more relaxed in tandem with ice extent drops, is tending to meander more, and hence move more slowly as well. As the Francis paper said, ""Previous studies support this idea: weaker zonal-mean, upper-level wind* is associated with increased atmospheric blocking events in the northern hemisphere."" [*she means high west-east moving winds]Let's look back again at this superstorm, and you'll see that important features of what you're about to experience stem from the Arctic situation I've been discussing. First, Arctic air is coming down to hook up with Sandy from the dip of the jet stream. Francis writes (from personal communication), ""The huge ice loss this summer, and subsequent enhanced warming of the Arctic (see attached figure), may be playing an important role in the evolution of Sandy by enhancing the amplitude of waves in the jet stream."" At the same time, high pressure over Greenland, and the extremely negative state of the North Atlantic Oscillation, is creating a blocking event that is impacting the path of Sandy herself, sending her back west over the U.S. Again, Dr. Francis (in personal communication): ""In this case, the effects could be causing strengthening of the block, elongating the block northward, and/or increasing its duration -- and this block is what's driving Sandy on such an unusual track westward into the mid-Atlantic coast.""Now, let's add to all that the underlying and obvious thing -- that Sandy is only surviving as a hurricane so far north, almost in November, because there are record high sea surface temperatures off the U.S. East coast right now. And while the third storm component, the one coming in from the west, might seem less remarkable, that is also something that generally becomes more probable with global warming, as our atmosphere can hold more water vapor as it warms and the evaporation rate is also increased by the warming. Thus, all major components of this superstorm show the signature of human-induced climate change to varying degrees, and without global warming the chance of the three occurring together like this would have a probability of about zero. So, let's make it simple, and just say climate change caused this storm.I'm in New York City, just as much in the path of Sandy as so many others are, but come on, you do just have to sit back and love it, appreciate the full irony of it all, with Sandy striking right at those most sensitive loins of our American democracy, threatening to interrupt our sacred electoral process, after that process blocked climate change out, and now an atmospheric blocking pattern, created by that very climate change, pushes Sandy back on us. In a time when climate silence trumps climate science, when the candidates seem terrified to mention the 'C-word,' Candy, I hope you enjoy meeting Sandy. Maybe if the election gets as messed up as 2000, you three can even find time to meet up again, and go over a little issue you couldn't quite find time to fit in before?"

He's worried Sandy will be worse. The 62-year-old songwriter has multiple medical complications as a result of having polio in 1954. Pavane, who lives in New Hyde Park, a town on Long Island's north shore, prefers to use an electronic wheelchair to move around, and depends on his nebulizer to breathe during asthma attacks.""It can be an issue if we lose power for a long time,"" he said. His nebulizer's batteries are currently broken, so it only works when it's plugged in to a power source -- and asthma has hit him hard this weekend. So if the power blows, he said he might not be able to breathe.Pavane is one of millions of Long Islanders preparing for the wrath of Sandy, a megastorm expected ""to bring life-threatening storm surge flooding to the mid-Atlantic coast,"" according to the National Weather Service. On Sunday, the storm raged several hundred miles south of Long Island, picking up speed. The National Weather Service expects the storm to hit New Jersey late Monday, and the National Hurricane Center told Newsday that Long Island will likely be at the center of the storm at one point. ""This particular coastal storm will have record-breaking tidal surges, surges we haven't seen for 30 years,"" Edward Mangano, Nassau County executive, told The Huffington Post. He ordered a mandatory evacuation of all flood zones on Sunday. ""With the storm tracking on high tides, we are very concerned with the impacts on the flooding,"" he said. Tides will be high between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Monday and between 7 p.m. and 12 a.m. Tuesday morning, with hurricane-force winds expected to hit at 3 p.m, according to Mangano. ""It's a very concerning cocktail of weather coming at us,"" Mangano said.While low-lying waterfront areas such as Islip, Babylon, Riverhead, Long Beach and Fire Island are being evacuated, analysts expect the storm's effects to be felt by those who live inland as well. The Long Island Power Authority warned that power outages could last between seven and 10 days. To prepare, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is sending in extra Coast Guard members. Towns are turning high schools and colleges into storm shelters -- including a pet shelter and a kosher shelter. Waterfronts are covered in sandbags, and many schools are preparing to close. Transit is also shutting down, with the Long Island Railroad and Nassau Inter County Express bus stopping service on Sunday evening.In Southhold, at the eastern end of Long Island, no one is supposed to be outside after 5 p.m., said Brian Flinn, a sports analyst who lives in a house on a creek.""Normally it's calm, but it's getting really wavy, probably 3 to 4 feet above what it normally is,"" Flinn said Sunday afternoon. ""The town is locking down, and everyone is bracing for the storm."" Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) called his house Sunday to say that he might be without power for a full week. Flinn bought a generator, but he's still worried about flooding. Pavane, the songwriter, recently had his house examined by LIPA because it was damaged in Hurricane Irene. But he still expects a power outage, so he's charging everything and has 100 candles at the ready. If his nebulizer dies, his life will depend on a trip to the emergency room -- one that will likely be imperiled by roads covered in felled trees.""During Irene, I got power back just in time,"" he said. ""I was thinking I might have to go to the hospital -- we lucked out by a few hours. I'm not sure what'll happen this time.""Medical issues are also top of mind for Alicia Erlich, a Franklin Square executive assistant whose 61-year-old mother has juvenile diabetes. Her insulin and eye drops need to stay refrigerated. ""These supplies aren't cheap to replace without a subscription,"" Erlich said. ""They only last so long until everything melts.""Huge storms have special meaning to John Licata, an energy analyst who recently moved to Lawrence, a town on Long Island's south shore. Last year, he got engaged on the night of Hurricane Irene. ""I just wanted to make it memorable,"" he said. But he also remembers the power outages. ""We're expecting an instant replay,"" he said. ""No storm has been able to turn left inward in many years, this will be the third time in at least 200 years.""Licata had to stop at several gas stations Sunday morning before he could fill his tank, and there was no milk or water left at his local grocery store. When he got home, he taped his windows shut and brought his outdoor furniture inside. ""It's already getting very windy here on Long Island,"" Licata said. ""The trees are swaying good.""Mangano said Nassau County residents facing non life-threatening emergencies should call 1-888-684-4274, not 911. Those facing non life-threatening emergencies in Suffolk County should call 631-852-COPS."

Amazon still has a variety monochrome Kindles, including its first touchscreen model. The screen is more legible than color screens in bright daylight and uses very little power. But it's slow to respond, making navigation a bit tedious, and the lack of color takes the joy out of children's books, magazines and comics. The touch-sensitivity does make navigation easier. (AP Photo/Amazon.com)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35abc200000e5000033ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jeremy WagstaffSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Amidst our growing love affair with the tablet, spare a thought for its increasingly shelfbound sibling: the e-reader.Take Taiwan's E Ink Holdings Inc, which makes most of the monochrome displays for devices such as Amazon.com Inc's Kindle and Barnes & Noble Inc's Nook. After five years of heady growth during which shipments rose 100-fold, it got a jolt at the end of 2011 when monthly revenues dropped 91 percent in two months.""The bottom fell out of the market,"" says E Ink Chief Marketing Officer Sriram Peruvemba.E-readers initially benefited from their reflective displays, which can be read in sunlight and require very little power. But the success of Apple Inc's iPad, improved backlit displays, power-saving technologies and new smaller tablets all point to one thing: the e-reader has become a transitional technology.Think the harpsichord, replaced by the piano. Or Apple's iPod music player, which helped popularize the MP3 player until the arrival of the iPhone, which could play music but also do a lot of other things.Now electronic paper companies like E Ink are scrabbling for new ways to sell the technology or in some cases, are pulling the plug entirely.A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that of those Americans over 30 who read e-books, less than half do so on an e-reader. For those under 30, the number falls to less than a quarter.Analysts have cut forecasts, sometimes dramatically. IHS iSuppli predicted last December there would be 43 million e-readers shipped in 2014. When it revised those numbers last month, the estimate was lowered by two thirds.By contrast, Morgan Stanley in June doubled its estimates for 2013 tablet shipments, predicting 216 million compared with its February 2011 forecast of 102 million.""Frustratingly for the E Ink guys, it's a transition device,"" says Robin Birtle, who runs an e-book publishing company in Japan. ""Kids won't need this.""POLE POSITIONCompanies giving up the ghost include Japanese tyre maker Bridgestone Corp which ended e-paper production this year after six years in the business, blaming falling prices and the rising popularity of tablets with LCD displays. Its partner Delta Electronics Inc also said it was pulling out.Qualcomm Inc, which snapped up two startups and launched several devices including the Kyobo Reader in South Korea, told investors in July it would now focus on licensing its Mirasol display technology.UK-based Plastic Logic said it had stopped making e-readers and was now looking to license its display technology for devices such as credit cards.That leaves E Ink, which this year bought one of its few remaining competitors, SiPix Technology, in pole position.Not all the news is bad. A new generation of e-readers with front lighting, which allows reading in the dark, is hitting the market. The Kindle Paperwhite sold out quickly and that device and the basic $69 Kindle e-reader are the No. 2 and No. 3 top selling products on Amazon, based on unit sales. Amazon also recently launched Kindles in two big new markets - India and Japan.E Ink's revenues have picked up somewhat from late last year and Chief Executive Scott Liu is promising good numbers when the company announces quarterly results on Wednesday.But E Ink is betting its future, not on consumers buying more e-readers, but elsewhere - including education, an area it sees as essential to growth.It has started to focus on adding features for classrooms, such as a master device to control which pages students look at, preventing them from flipping ahead to, for example, an answers page. Amazon this month announced a push to get Kindles into U.S. schools, selling e-readers at bulk discount.But it will be an uphill battle. For one thing, Apple has stolen a march in the United States, saying that 80 percent of the country's ""core curricula"" is available in its digital bookstore. And while educational institutions are investing in e-books, they're not necessarily investing in e-reading hardware.In Singapore, for example, one university library has dedicated 95 percent of its budget to e-books. But the country remains one of the few where the Kindle is not available, suggesting that those e-books are not being read on dedicated devices.E Ink also hopes to see its technology in more devices than e-readers. Over the years E Ink displays have appeared in watches, on a Samsung cellphone keypad and on USB drives. One e-ink sign in Japan survived the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and was able to display emergency contact and route information long after other powered-displays fell dark.Peruvemba travels the world to trade shows peddling an impressive array of prototypes he hopes to tempt manufacturers with, from a music stand with a built-in e-reader to a traffic light. Says CEO Liu: ""I've told our people that in five years non e-reader applications will be as big as the e-reader applications.""This makes sense, analysts say. ""We have dialed back our take on them,"" said Jonathan Melnick of Lux Research. ""But we still think the technology is going to have a future. It's just not going to be in e-readers.""OUTFLANKED AND SLOWBut not all are so optimistic. Not only has E Ink been outflanked by the emergence of the tablet, it's also been slow to innovate.Although the screens of the latest Kindles refresh faster than earlier models, critics say they still look a little old-fashioned alongside displays from Apple or Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.""I don't see any significant improvements in the technology in the past few years,"" says Calvin Shao of Fubon Securities.E Ink's own history is not encouraging. It took a long time for e-ink to emerge: Xerox had dabbled in it since the 1970s but it was only in the late 1990s that physicist Joseph Jacobson thought of mixing a dark dye and particles of white titanium dioxide in microcapsules. Stimulated by an electrical charge- a process called electrophoresis - one or other would move to the top to form shapes.Even then it took seven years and $150 million for the company he founded, E Ink, to create its first e-reader, and another two years to tease out production problems for its first customer Sony Corp.And then it took Amazon's heft to persuade the public to adopt the e-reader by adding a compelling range of books, wireless connectivity and the promise of instant downloads.E Ink says it is undeterred and intends to play a more central role in any new industry it finds a foothold in. ""For our new products we will no longer be a component player,"" said CEO Liu.Its chances of success are limited, says Alva Taylor, who uses E Ink as a case study for his classes at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. ""The success rate for companies with a technology searching for a solution is pretty low.""(Additional reporting by Mayumi Negishi in Tokyo and Alistair Barr in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)"

He might have gone to the perfect,2012-10-28,"Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill (17) looks to pass during the second half of an NFL preseason football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Friday, Aug. 10, 2012, in Miami. (AP Photo/Rhona Wise)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6bd5d3c000032000d6222.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dan Pompei, National Football Post  A lot of people, including this writer, were skeptical about Ryan Tannehill. Many thought the Dolphins reached to take him with the eighth overall pick.So in some ways, Tannehill’s sprint out of the gates has been more remarkable than the starts of Robert Griffin III and Andrew Luck, though Tannehill hasn’t been acclaimed as much.Tannehill was not supposed to be NFL ready like the top two picks in the draft. He had only 19 starts at quarterback at Texas A&M, and was 7-6 as a starter last year. He failed to rally the Aggies on several occasions. Eight personnel men I spoke with before the draft thought he was a second round talent.Tannehill’s stock rose late in the draft process mostly because of the need at his position. He might have gone to the perfect team, because he didn’t have to learn a new offense in Miami. Dolphins offensive coordinator Mike Sherman also happened to be Tannehill’s head coach at A&M, and that is a significant reason why Tannehill has been successful early.“The protections, the terminology, the route trees, the nomenclature, he’s very familiar with all if it,” Sherman said. “That’s a whole language he didn’t have to learn. That helped him settle down and adapt himself to the NFL game. He didn’t have to worry about the meeting room stuff because of his familiarity. All he had to worry about was our opponents. That’s been his focus and he’s done a pretty good job at that.”Tannehill’s familiarity with the Dolphins’ offense has helped offset his lack of experience. Sherman said if Tannehill has played all four years of college ball at quarterback in a completely different offense, his NFL acclimation would have been bumpier than it has been.“If he had been in a spread offense and never been under center, never taken a drop, even though he would have had experience as a quarterback, it wouldn’t have helped as much as less experience in this offense,” Sherman said. “All that experience he had [in college] is applicable to what we are doing at this level.”There is more to Tannehill’s success, of course. Sherman acknowledges the quarterback has improved “dramatically” in his decision making since last year. He is stepping up in the pocket better and spotting receivers downfield better. Sherman said Tannehill has improved every week since the season began, and that Tannehill rarely has repeated mistakes.“He’s making very good decisions, better than he made in college,” Sherman said. “He’s not taking high risk throws. He’s still an aggressive quarterback and will take his shots, but he weighs the risk/reward element of it.”These numbers illustrate Sherman’s point: on throws of 20 yards or longer, Tannehill has a passer rating of 137.5 with no interceptions. He has thrown only three interceptions in his last five games.Tannehill’s growth has a lot to do with his intangibles, which always seem to be underrated in quarterback evaluation. “He was studying to be a doctor, and graduated pre-med,” Sherman said. “He’s a very smart young man. He put down the biology book and picked up the playbook and he studies it. He’s a workaholic. Used to study constantly, now he’s all football. He’s up here putting in coaches’ hours as far as studying game tapes and getting ready for the games. It’s his desire to help us win and have success.”In most cases, coaches are hesitant to allow rookies to run the no huddle too much. But the Dolphins have run more no huddle than any other team. They have been able to because of Tannehill’s confidence. He played a lot of no huddle at A&M, and it’s been a smooth transition.“We don’t go at the tempo the Patriots go at,” Sherman said. “We might be able to handle that at some point. But the ability to line up and decipher the defense without worrying the clock ticking away has helped him make some subtle adjustments presnap.”Tannehill has considerable freedom at the line of scrimmage, which also is unusual for a rookie. Sherman said Tannehill probably has adjusted between 10 and 15 play calls at the line each game. Sometimes, he is given a group of plays and he has to pick one. Other times, he is given an either/or situation. And in some instances, he retargets protections to offset defensive presnap looks.“If I call a play that won’t work against a leveraged defense, he’ll get us into a better play,” Sherman said. “He has a fair amount of flexibility. He doesn’t’ go outside of the rules we set, but he has a fair amount of options available to him.”Tannehill has been an outlier in many aspects. Credit goes to Sherman, Dolphins general manager Jeff Ireland and Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin for recognizing what he was and how he could succeed.Things I Didn’t Used To Know*Sidney Rice is the Seahawks’ most talented receiver, but there is a reason he has been overlooked in the passing game. The oft-injured Rice didn’t have a chance to work with new quarterback Russell Wilson in the offseason because he was rehabbing from shoulder surgeries, and he missed a good portion of camp and the preseason. As a result, Wilson and Rice were not clicking very well on the field. Their chemistry has improved, but it still has a ways to go. While Rice was working his way back into the offense, Golden Tate became the team’s primary vertical threat. But it’s likely the Seahawks coaches will push Rice back to the forefront now. It’s obvious they need his big play potential.*If they are expecting a player in “steep decline,” the Eagles might not recognize Asante Samuel when they play the Falcons Sunday. Samuel is having a fine season in Atlanta, and the Falcons are elated they gave up a seventh round pick for the 31-year old. The knock of Samuel throughout his career has been that he is a poor tackler and disinterested in run support, but Falcons coaches have been happy with his physical game. Samuel also has brought an air of confidence to the Falcons’ secondary. He has rubbed off on younger players. And if Samuel wasn’t in Atlanta, the Falcons might not be undefeated. His Pick Six against Oakland with 2:40 remaining in the game was a critical play.*Some interesting research courtesy of Tony Villiotti: 24 of the NFL starting QBs were first round picks; 20 starting QBs are playing for the teams that drafted them, and there are 13 undrafted quarterbacks in the NFL. That’s more than came from the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh rounds of the draft. There is only one undrafted starter, however: Tony Romo. Check out Villiotti’s Draftmetrics here.My Sunday Best: Rookie QB ClassesThe 2012 class of quarterbacks has a lot of potential and could eventually be thought of as one of the best quarterback classes if Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Tannehill, Brandon Weeden, Russell Wilson and company continue to develop. Here are my Sunday best quarterback classes of all time. I didn’t consider a class unless there were at least four strong players from it.1. 1983—John Elway, Jim Kelly, Tony Eason, Ken O’Brien, Dan Marino. Three hall of fame quarterbacks from one round isn’t too shabby. The great Marino was almost an afterthought, chosen 27th. Trivia question: which quarterback from this class went on to be a head coach? Answer: Gary Kubiak, chosen in the eighth round.2. 2004—Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Schaub. These guys have a lot of football left in them, but already they have four Super Bowl championships and nine Pro Bowls.3. 1957--John Brodie, Len Dawson, Milt Plum, Sonny Jurgensen, Jack Kemp, Ken Ploen. This class produced two Pro Football Hall of Famers in Dawson and Jurgensen. Kemp was the 1965 AFL player of the year and he was voted to seven Pro Bowls. Brodie and Plum each were two-time Pro Bowlers. Ploen never made it to the NFL, but he is in the Canadian League hall of fame.4. 1948--Harry Gilmer, Bobby Layne, Y.A. Title, George Ratterman. This was the first great quarterback class. Layne and Title are hall of famers. Gilmer was a two-time Pro Bowler. And Ratterman was second in the NFL in passing yards in 1950.5. 1971—Jim Plunkett, Archie Manning, Dan Pastorini, Lynn Dickey, Ken Anderson, Joe Theismann. This may have been the deepest class of quality quarterbacks in history. Plunkett won two Super Bowls and Theisman won another. Anderson led the league in passing twice and Manning finished second twice.6. 1984--Boomer Esiason, Jeff Hostetler, Jay Schroeder, Steve Young. This group might get an asterisk because Young was a supplemental pick. Between them, they have six Super Bowl rings, though Hostetler was a backup for one of the Giants’ Super Bowl victories and Young was as backup for two of the 49ers’ victories.7. 1973--Bert Jones, Ron Jaworski, Joe Ferguson, Dan Fouts, Don Strock. Fouts is in the hall of fame. Jones, Jaworski and Ferguson each had some fine seasons, and Strock is remembered for his role in one of the greatest games in history—the 1982 playoff game between the Dolphins and Chargers.8. 1987--Vinny Testaverde, Jim Harbaugh, Rich Gannon, Steve Beuerlein, Don Majkowski. This class had staying power. Between these five players, they played a combined 76 NFL seasons. That’s incredible.9. 1999—Tim Couch, Donovan McNabb, Akili Smith, Daunte Culpepper, Shaun King, Aaron Brooks. These six players threw for a combined 99,599 yards.10. 2011 Cam Newton, Jake Locker, Blaine Gabbert, Christian Ponder, Andy Dalton, Colin Kaepernick. Of course the jury is still out on last year’s class, as it is with the class of 2012. But it is off to a pretty good start.One Man Yelp: Football’s GreatestSports Illustrated has come out what a big, beautiful coffee table book called Football’s Greatest. It is noteworthy for its provocation (the book ranks the best players at every position, plus coaches, games, plays, single season teams and more), content (nice vignettes about each subject matter), and photography (gorgeous full page pictures that bring history to life).You can get lost in the book pretty easily because there are so many interesting aspects of it and it goes in so many directions. It’s the perfect book for a doctor’s waiting room or an office lobby. Much more interesting than my IPhone.I’ll give you a few of the debate-worthy rankings, which were voted on by a panel consisting of Don Banks, Mark Godich, Damon Hack, Peter King, Tim Layden, Mark Mravic and Jim Trotter. For quarterbacks, Joe Montana is No. 1; Tom Brady is No. 3, ahead of Otto Graham (4), Peyton Manning (5) and John Elway (6). Ray Lewis is the No. 3 linebacker, behind only Lawrence Taylor and Dick Butkus. Bill Belichick ranks No. 7 on the coaching list, behind Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown, Bill Walsh, Chuck Noll, George Halas and Don Shula. Greatest single season team was the 1985 Bears.Hot Reads*As Chris Cooley would tell you, who needs money when you can have Heineken?*Glad to see Jerry Jones believes in donating to his Church.*Some of these star players may be saying goodbye to their teams in the offseason.

They are in a mixed marriage: she's a Republican, he's a Democrat. Both take their respective affiliations seriously.They've always made their union of political opposites work. But this season, there is coolness in the political air. They find themselves avoiding dangerous territory.""It's funny,"" Paula told me. It's just harder to talk about things in this race.""Maybe they just reflect the country as a whole -- the feeling that it's a zero-sum game. From the left: Republicans are for the rich, and against just about everybody else. From the right: Obama will preside over America's financial ruin.Both those positions have likely been hardened by the current climate of Congressional polarization: ""I'm OK. You're the anti-Christ.""Evidence of a hardening of positions is visible in a paper published in Public Opinion Quarterly. Stanford University professor Shanto Iyengar points to a 1960s study that found 5 percent of couples would be upset if their child married outside their political party. A study in 2010 put that figure at 40 percent. For the record, Republicans would be more upset -- 50 percent to 30 percent.How do couples cope? There are some visible examples that say it can work. Mary Matalin and James Carville have not only crafted a 20 year marriage out of political opposition, they've turned it into a lucrative traveling show. The current odd couple is vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan and his wife, Janna. He: impeccable Republican credentials. She: from a prominent Democratic family and a former high-profile D.C. lobbyist.Mrs. Ryan was described by friends in a recent New York Times article as a liberal- leaning Democrat turned political conservative -- with some reader posts calling her apparent conversion nothing less than an ideological betrayal. Ah -- the things we do for love.We might assume that the political issue would be addressed at the beginning -- during dating. Political opposites would be eliminated the way a PETA member would write off a dove hunter. The much-quoted Match.com survey, ""Singles in America"", says: not necessarily. Only 17 percent of men and 20 percent of women said that someone of the same party was a ""must have."" Compare that to 65 percent who said they must have respect, trust and the ability to confide in each other.Overall, 57 percent of singles said they would marry someone with dramatically different political beliefs. That seems to make it more of a consideration than a deal breaker -- perhaps on the order of your significant other's position on reality shows.Surveys do find one interesting political difference. Conservative Republicans are more likely to want someone who shares their values. But they are more likely than Democrats to cross party lines to find romance -- something James Carville attributes to the fact that ""Democrats are hotter.""When dating progresses to marriage, there is research evidence that opinions tend to blend over time. Husbands used to dominate the shift. More recent surveys show a more mutual convergence.Still, there are limits. Our political persuasion is a potent combination of genetics, family and where we grew up. The Match.com survey found that almost half hadn't changed a political view in the last ten years; and almost 95 percent had never changed a political belief because of a relationship.The majority who are willing to cross party lines for love must also confront a fact of 21st century life. In everything from choice of TV news to favorite Internet sites to living in a red or blue state, it's very easy to insulate ourselves from all opinions that are contrary to our own. That hermetic seal is harder to maintain within the walls of a two-party home.There are some common sense considerations for peaceful co-existence.First: don't try to the win the argument. You won't, and it will never end. Agree to accept -- even celebrate -- your perpetual state of counter opinions. Don't plaster the refrigerator with the latest win for your side or setback for the other. Don't inject politics into family issues: neither Democrats nor Republicans are to blame for a tight budget or rocky relationship. Never try to win the kids to your side. One more: if your spouse puts a campaign sign on the lawn, don't steal it in the middle of the night.The most important thing in an age when we tend to argue positions with fingers stuck in both ears is, simply, take them out. Listen. Somewhere in the opinions from the supposed dark side there may be an idea or two to consider. That one is as useful on the other side of the aisle, as it is from the other side of the bed."

The world may soon know what the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency has on Armstrong. USADA has said it had 10 former teammates ready to testify against Armstrong before he chose not to take his case to an arbitration hearing. The list likely includes previous Armstrong accusers Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b1c72100003300c65499.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles, numerous endorsements, and banned from cycling and Olympic competition for life. He has been exposed as a fake, a cheater, and a mean-spirited bully. Proof that Armstrong was the ringleader of the biggest sports doping conspiracy ever is overwhelming. But he has escaped one major pitfall -- he has not been criminally charged for obviously prosecutable crimes in what anti-doping officials have called ""the most sophisticated doping program in history."" Why has Armstrong escaped a criminal prosecution?  The U.S. Justice Department investigated Armstrong in 2010 after cyclist Floyd Landis, another Tour de France winner and former teammate of Armstrong's on the U.S. Postal Service team, blew the whistle on Armstrong's extensive drug use. Landis reported that Armstrong conspired with other teammates on how to use drugs and avoid detection, and his use of guile and threats to keep others silent. Dozens of witnesses, including many of the most famous riders on Armstrong's team, testified before a federal grand jury about the widespread fraudulent scheme and drug trafficking conspiracy. But the federal investigation was abruptly halted last winter by the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, Andre Birotte, Jr. without any explanation. Agents involved in the investigation reportedly were stunned and furious that the case was dropped. There appears to be no credible reason why the prosecutor decided to terminate the investigation.  The obvious question is whether a prosecutor can simply stop an ongoing investigation without giving any reason? Doesn't the public have a right to know why a famous athlete who appears to have committed serious crimes and where there appears to be abundant evidence to prove his wrongdoing is being let off? Can an individual force a prosecutor to act? Can a court? Can a grand jury?   The law is very clear: A prosecutor's power to bring criminal charges also includes the power to not bring charges. Indeed, a prosecutor's discretion to decline to bring charges is much more controversial than a prosecutor's discretion to affirmatively bring charges. This is because the basis for the decision not to charge is far more unknowable than the decision to bring charges. The prosecutor's decision to bring charges involves much more transparency because the basis for that decision may be illuminated by rules of discovery, motions to dismiss, and ultimately a criminal trial. But if a prosecutor decides not to prosecute a case, there is way to know why the prosecutor refused to act, unless the prosecutor publicly announces his or her reasons. An individual has no power to force a prosecutor to bring charges. Nor may a court compel a prosecutor to proceed in a case that a prosecutor believes does not warrant a prosecution.  Indeed, even a grand jury cannot compel a prosecutor to bring charges. In an important case occurring during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, United States v. Cox, a federal district judge in Mississippi held the prosecutor in contempt for refusing to sign an indictment voted by a federal grand jury against two civil rights activists. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the citation, stating that a prosecutor's discretion not to sign or prosecute an indictment cannot be coerced or reviewed by the courts. This refusal to compel prosecution is based on the constitution's separation of powers, which means that courts are not allowed to micromanage the way prosecutors do their jobs.   One can only speculate on why U.S. Attorney Birotte declined to prosecute Armstrong despite what appears to be powerful evidence of conspiracy, fraud, doping, and obstruction of justice. Perhaps the acquittal of Roger Clemens of all charges that he lied to Congress about using steroids, and the ambiguous verdict in the Barry Bonds prosecution in which a jury convicted Bonds of the weakest count of obstruction of justice by giving evasive answers to a grand jury about whether he used performance enhancing drugs, persuaded the Justice Department that it had run its course on trying to prosecute elite athletes for using drugs. The Justice Department also may have been smarting over the recent acquittal of John Edwards for campaign finance violations in a prosecution that many commentators saw as an overreach. And the Justice Department also may have felt that Armstrong's iconic status as a cancer survivor who became a cycling champion and world-wide celebrity may have made a successful prosecution seem much more difficult.  But speculation is simply that. And the failure of a prosecutor such as Mr. Birotte to explain his reasons for non-prosecution likely will breed cynicism and make the public distrust the faurness and impartiality of the criminal justice system. To be sure, a prosecutor's decision not to prosecute may be the result of a good faith evaluation of the evidence, the need to conserve scarce resources, and the risks of losing an importanmt case. But the decision also may be made in bad faith, for corrupt or improper reasons. But the public will never know why because prosecutors are not required to give reasons. So while people may speculate and wonder why, the question of whether Lance Armstrong has escaped criminal prosecution for proper reasons or improper reasons may never be known."

In 2008, authorities had seized 3.6 metric tons of harvested and dried marijuana, and 22,000 marijuana plants were seized from his property in Inglewood. At the time of seizure, prosecutors estimated that the street value of the drugs at about $68 million.Authorities also found a weapon arsenal that included 10,000 rounds of ammunition, according to Sunshine Coast Daily.Last Friday, Gardner represented himself in court to appeal his sentence. He argued that he should be sentenced for at least 20 years. He said he was indignant that the court had not recognized the ""full gravity"" of his crop yield, the Courier Mail reported.The court rejected the appeal.Gardner, who appeared at his appeal wearing a T-shirt that read, ""Abortion is Killing,"" stated back in June that he had been growing marijuana to raise funds for a national anti-abortion campaign. He said he felt it was his duty to ""shock"" Australians into ""realizing what they were allowing,"" according to the Brisbane Times.""I think for the law to allow [abortion] is abominable,"" said Gardner, who has nine children."
