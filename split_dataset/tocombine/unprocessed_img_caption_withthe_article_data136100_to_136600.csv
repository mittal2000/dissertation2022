1,BUSINESS,Black Friday May Not Be Shopping Boon Retailers Are Hoping For,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-friday-shopping_us_5bb30358e4b0480ca6615d97,"(Corrects spelling of town's name to Haverford in 16th paragraph) By Suzanne Barlyn, Phil Wahba, Marina Lopes and Dhanya",2013-11-29,"A woman shopper, sits on her shopping cart, using her smart phone to check prices as she shopped in Miami's Dolphin Mall, Friday, Nov. 29, 213. Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is the nation's biggest shopping day of the year. (AP Photo/J Pat Carter)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb303581f0000390123bb64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Corrects spelling of town's name to Haverford in 16th paragraph) By Suzanne Barlyn, Phil Wahba, Marina Lopes and Dhanya Skariachan NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - An early start to this year's U.S. holiday Shopping season may not necessarily ring-up bigger holiday sales for retailers. Eager to entice cautious consumers, especially with six fewer shopping days this year than in 2012, many retailers offered sales on Thanksgiving, traditionally a day for family, friends and football games. Even Macy's flagship store in New York opened at 8 p.m., the first time ever on the American holiday. As a result, some U.S. shoppers may have hit malls and stores on Thanksgiving, rather than during the traditional ""Black Friday"" blitz. By late morning, the number of shoppers in many stores more closely resembled a normal Saturday than the usual frenzied Black Friday kickoff to the holiday season.  ""It's a lot less than I thought,"" said Alison Goodwin, from Horsham, Pennsylvania, who ventured to the Willow Grove Park mall the day after Thanksgiving in search of holiday gifts and maybe a treat for herself.  ""It's like any weekend in December,"" Goodwin said of the size of the crowd.  Terry Lundgren, Macy's Inc Chief Executive, said the Thanksgiving flagship Manhattan store opening lured an estimated 15,000 shoppers. Roughly 11,000 shoppers turned out at the store for last year's Black Friday midnight open. ""It's not just spreading out traffic over last year but it's also increasing it,"" Lundgren said of the department store overall. He declined to say how much he expects the additional shopping to increase sales.  The National Retail Federation is predicting that holiday sales will increase a marginal 3.9 percent to $602.1 billion, leaving retailers to battle for a bigger slice of that somewhat larger pie. This year's holiday shopping results likely will mimic the slow-growing U.S. economy and leave little to write home about, said Can Erbil, an adjunct associate professor of economics at Boston College. ""Last year's shopping season was actually pretty bad. The Connecticut school shootings, Hurricane Sandy, and fiscal cliff fears really hit the shopping season hard. So the benchmark is low,"" Erbil said. Thanksgiving proved bright for one sliver of retail - online sales. Overall Thanksgiving online sales were up 19.7 percent from last year and the average order value was $127.59, according to IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark.    Early Black Friday turnout was thin at Willow Grove Park mall, in a Philadelphia suburb. Early morning shoppers included Emily Arkowitz and Ashlee Ryan, two friends on their first-ever Black Friday excursion and browsing at an H&M clothing store at 7:30 a.m. EST.  ""We walked in thinking that all the clothes would be gone,"" said Arkowitz of Haverford, Pennsylania.  The store sold out of many specials, according to a manager, but many Black Friday deals were still advertised on clothing racks, including a $4.95 sweater and $14.95 dress.  Turned off by crowds and last night's long lines at a nearby Abercrombie & Fitch, Pranav Trivedi, a shopper from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, went home, napped, and returned early on Friday. ""I didn't want to waste my time like that,"" he said. While shoppers snapped up sale priced flat-screen televisions at stores like Target, Walmart and Best Buy - not everyone was impressed by the ""deals"" being touted by retailers.  For Luis Figueiro, a retired Brazilian on vacation in New York, Black Friday ended early. ""This is madness,"" he said, sitting in a massage chair, pointing at the crowd at Macy's flagship store on Thanksgiving night. ""There are so many people here, you can't see any of the things on sale."" His wife, Irene, traveled with him from Rio with Black Friday deals in mind, but was disappointed to find that many items were not discounted.  ""If someone comes without a clear notion of prices, it awakens something in you. But if you know what the items usually cost, you aren't fazed,"" she said.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc U.S. Chief Executive Bill Simon said Thanksgiving visits to its stores surpassed last year's 22 million mark, although a swarm of online shoppers crashed its online site.  ""We are encouraged by the start to the Black Friday shopping weekend,"" Simon told CNN.

The union ver.di called for a strike of employees of Amazon, demanding a wage agreement . (AP Photo/Jens Meyer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb36c8c2200005700dbe351.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Emma Thomasson and Nadine SchimroszikHAMBURG (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has no intention of bowing to pressure from striking workers in Germany, its second biggest market behind the United States, and is more worried about bad weather hurting Christmas deliveries, its country head said.""We are talking about a minority who take part in actions brought on by the union,"" Ralf Kleber told Reuters in an interview.""Amazon is a fair employer. Many of our workers have been with us for more than 14 years. The majority of workers would say it is a good, well-paid job.""Trade union Verdi has staged a series of strikes this year in a dispute over pay and conditions at distribution centers in Leipzig and Bad Hersfeld. On Monday, the union said about 1,000 employees walked out, almost a fifth of the regular workforce there. Amazon said less than 800 staff had joined the strike.""Snowfall in Germany is the bigger problem in the Christmas business ... that is what gives me worry lines,"" Kleber said, adding that the strikes had not affected deliveries so far.E-commerce sales in Germany are seen growing 12 percent for the full year to 33.1 billion euros ($45 billion), expanding an even faster 15 percent in the Christmas period, when the sector should make 8.5 billion euros in sales.Amazon employs 9,000 warehouse staff in Germany plus 14,000 seasonal workers and sales there grew almost 21 percent in 2012 to $8.7 billion, representing a third of its overseas total.BLACK SHEEP?The union, which plans more strikes before Christmas, wants Amazon to accept a collective agreement on pay and conditions similar to deals it has in the mail order and retail industry and accepted by Amazon's biggest German rival, the Otto Group.Michael Otto, chairman of the firm which has transformed itself from a mail order firm into Europe's second biggest online retailer, said last week unnamed competitors were tarnishing the image of e-commerce with poor working conditions.""These black sheep are trying to get to the feeding trough and are creating short-term advantages for themselves with their social dumping,"" he told a retail congress in Berlin. ""We need a consensus that minimum standards must be maintained.""Amazon says it pays staff in its nine German distribution centers well according to the standards of the logistics industry, and does not think the terms of the mail order and retail sector are justified for its largely unskilled staff.""We are a logistics company. Trucks arrive, are unloaded. Goods are sorted, packed and loaded into trucks again,"" Kleber said, adding Amazon hired staff with no qualifications and many who had previously been unemployed for a long time.A BBC documentary this week alleged that tough working conditions could threaten the health of Amazon logistics employees after an undercover reporter secretly filmed inside a British warehouse where he walked 11 miles in the course of night shift lasting 10-1/2 hours.Kleber agreed that logistics was a demanding job, but rejected suggestions that Amazon drives staff too hard.""People in logistics don't want their staff to walk more. They want staff to walk less, because walking less means being more efficient,"" Kleber said.Amazon has announced recently it would build three new logistics centers in Poland and two in the Czech Republic, prompting speculation that it could seek to shift work across the border from strike-hit centers in Germany.But Kleber said Amazon expected to keep expanding in Germany, including eventually delivering fresh groceries too, without giving a timetable. Its newest distribution center outside Berlin held its formal opening on Thursday.""We have bonuses for the whole team rather than for the individual so nobody has an incentive to rush,"" said Karsten Mueller, head of the new Brieselang center, whose 1,000 staff will shift about 110,000 parcels on a busy day.Sorting goods in six halls spread across the area of 10 football pitches, staff work 9-1/2 hour shifts in the peak period before Christmas, including a 45-minute break, with order pickers walking an average of 8-10 km a shift.In addition to strikes, Amazon has faced criticism in Germany for a low tax bill and from the antitrust watchdog, which forced it to stop demanding third-party merchants offer their cheapest price when selling products on its platform.($1=0.7353 euros)(Editing by Greg Mahlich)"

In 2008, he penned a Village Voice essay titled ""Why I Am No Longer a Brain-Dead Liberal."" Earlier this year, he voiced his anti-gun control sentiments in a Newsweek piece. Now, Mamet has slammed President Barack Obama with a rather harsh label. ""He's a tyrant,"" Mamet said during an appearance on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show."" ""And I give him great credit. He's always said that his idea was to reform the United States. And, you know, like many tyrants, like Wilson and like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he believes that his way is the right way and that he's going to implement his vision of the world, and many agree with him. And he's acting in concert with his conscience. And I applaud him for that. I just disagree with everything he's done.""Mamet's sentiments are, of course, in good company, even among the liberal-heavy entertainment industry. Matt Damon (""Imagine if they had a leader""), James Woods (""This president is a true abomination"") and director Oliver Stone (""Obama is a snake"") are among the celebrities who've spoken out against Obama in recent months.Just a few weeks ago, Mamet lambasted what he sees as the Obama administration's overreaching arm, telling The Daily Beast that the current government bears a resemblance to Lenin and Marx. ""Don’t you know who these people [members of the Obama administration] are?"" the ""Glenglarry Glen Ross"" scribe asked. ""What in their history do they find inconsistent with totalitarianism, or at best statism, or at worst Marxism? They want to take over the government. They don’t care how they do it. You can’t believe a word they say.”Mamet, 65, has also tackled political subjects in his work, like the prescient presidential affair scandal in 1997's ""Wag the Dog,"" for which he and co-writer Hilary Henkin received an Oscar nomination.

6,IMPACT,"Americans Don't Really Care About Typhoon Haiyan, Study Says",Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/typhoon-philippines-america-donations_us_5bb1b7d3e4b01857b70acc1a,"Within 10 days of the Haiti earthquake in 2010, Americans donated more than $300 million to relief efforts, NPR reported",2013-11-29,"GUIUAN, EASTERN SAMAR, PHILIPPINES - NOVEMBER 20: Children hold placards as they appeal for help with motorists following the recent super typhoon on November 20, 2013 near Guiuan, Eastern Samar, Philippines. Typhoon Haiyan, which ripped through the Philippines on November 9, has been described as one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit land, leaving thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. Countries all over the world have pledged relief aid to help support those affected by the typhoon, however damage to the airport and roads have made moving the aid into the most affected areas very difficult. With dead bodies left out in the open air and very limited food, water and shelter, health concerns are growing. (Photo by Jeoffrey Maitem/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1b7d3240000310096dc85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was one of the strongest storms in world history, but even so, Americans aren’t that interested in Typhoon Haiyan, a new study shows.After surveying 1,013 adults a week after the storm hit, the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found that Americans’ engagement with the news and in donating to the relief effort is trailing behind other recent natural disasters. According to the poll, 14 percent of Americans said they’ve made a donation to charities working in the Philippines and 17 percent said they plan on doing so. In the same period after the massive earthquake hit Haiti, 18 percent of Americans said they contributed and 30 percent said they planned on donating.While contributions historically tend to pick up in the weeks following a disaster, the actual difference in dollars and cents has already varied vastly between these two crises in particular. Within 10 days of the Haiti earthquake in 2010, Americans donated more than $300 million to relief efforts, NPR reported. Part of what helped smash fundraising records was the nascent text-donation technology, which had not previously been available in the wake of a crisis. In the week following Typhoon Haiyan, initial numbers showed that Americans donated more than $33 million, CNN Money reported. But it’s not just the actual monetary donations that are flagging. Americans don’t appear all that interested in even following the unfolding tragedy, which has already claimed more than 5,000 lives. According to Pew, 60 percent of Americans were following the Haiti earthquake aftermath “very closely” and 55 percent of Americans did the same after the Japan Tsunami.Just 32 percent of Americans have been engaged with the news about the typhoon, the study found. The most closely followed story the week the storm hit was the ongoing rollout of the 2010 Affordable Care Act; the typhoon came in second.Pew didn’t reveal why Americans have been less engaged with Typhoon Haiyan, but experts believe it may mostly be related to the timing of the storm.Sandra Miniutti, vice president, marketing and CFO of watchdog Charity Navigator, told The Huffington Post that Americans have likely been preoccupied with a number of other issues. For one, the Midwest tornadoes cut news coverage of the typhoon short and the approaching holidays could be making people less inclined to part with their money.Experts estimate that the cost of rebuilding the devastated parts of the Philippines could reach $5.8 billion, Reuters reported.While relief agencies initially faced major obstacles in delivering aid to those who needed it most, authorities say that the “worst is over.” ""We have overcome the most difficult part,"" Eduardo del Rosario, civil defense chief, told the AP on Friday. ""In the first week we can say we were in the emergency room ... this second week we are now in the ICU, still critical but stabilized.""Are you part of the 17 percent that has committed to donating to Philippine relief efforts? Awesome! You can find tons of ways you can help out typhoon victims right here."

The British luxury fashion house has appealed a decision made by Chinese authorities that would allow other companies to lawfully use their iconic check pattern on leather goods. According to The Guardian, the verdict came down because Burberry has not made enough use of the Haymarket Check in China for three years. WWD reported that back in August 2012, the Trademark Office received a complaint which challenged Burberry's right to the check for leather goods in China. The complaint was supposedly brought about by a division of the Lubida factory, an organization which Burberry had previously sued for creating counterfeit bags. Hmm, something smells a little fishy. Fortunately, Burberry can rest easy for the moment. Until a decision is reached on the appeal, they still have sole rights to their tartan pattern. But if the court's ruling doesn't go in their favor, what will it mean for the company who has built an empire around their well-known pattern?

8,CRIME,Thanksgiving for Rep. Trey Radel,"René Bryce-Laporte, Contributor

Trey Radel (R-Fla.) pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. While this is likely not an easy time for the congressman, let us be clear: He has many reasons relevant to this case to be grateful this Thanksgiving.",2013-11-28,"In a photo taken Tuesday, July 9, 2013, at the Capitol in Washington, Rep. Henry ""Trey"" Radel, a freshman Republican from Florida, joins Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, and GOP leaders at a news conference following a GOP strategy session. Congressman Radel has been charged with cocaine possession and faces arraignment Wednesday in Washington, Nov. 20, 2013. Radel was elected in 2012 to represent Florida's 19th Congressional District, which includes the Gulf Coast communities of Fort Myers and Naples. He was a radio host before coming to Congress and identifies himself on his Twitter profile as a ""Hip Hop conservative.? (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b0d82100003300c6543d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week U.S. Rep. Trey Radel (R-Fla.) pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in Washington, D.C. The congressman was arrested by agents after purchasing 3.5 grams of cocaine for $250. While this is likely not an easy time for the congressman, let us be clear: He has many reasons relevant to this case to be grateful this Thanksgiving. Rep. Radel should be grateful that he is not a low- or moderate-income defendant in his hometown of Fort Myers, Fla. A person who is convicted of a felony drug crime in Florida suffers a number of criminal and civil penalties. Several of these penalties have particularly tough implications for low- and moderate-income people. Here are a few:SentencingRep. Radel's sentence was generous. The maximum penalty in Florida for Rep. Radel's crime is five years in jail. He was permitted to plead to a misdemeanor and received a sentence of one year's probation. A first-time offender with good representation might be able to avoid jail time. In most cases, though, a defendant caught with 3.5 grams of cocaine would not be permitted to plead to a misdemeanor (the importance of avoiding a felony conviction is huge), and the probationary period would likely be closer to three years. The unfortunate truth is that a Florida defendant who cannot afford private counsel is more likely to receive a stiff sentence. That doesn't speak to the skills of Florida's public defenders. Both the public defender's and prosecutor's offices are overwhelmed. There is pressure on both sides to dispose of cases quickly. If all the drug cases in Florida went to trial, the entire system would grind to a halt. The threat by a private attorney to drag a case out over a number of months is not an idle one. In order to preserve resources, a prosecutor may be more willing to make a deal with a defendant whose attorney isn't overwhelmed and can take the time to defend their client to the fullest. HousingRep. Radel should be grateful that he doesn't rely on public housing. He is a business owner, and his congressional financial disclosure form reveals that he has inherited millions of dollars. He owns a home of his own. If he lived in public housing, his conviction would result in the expulsion of his entire family from their home. No such penalties apply to wealthy home owners. Even in private housing, most landlords do background checks. A felony record makes it much more difficult for an ex-offender to get housing. Public BenefitsRep. Radel should be grateful that he doesn't need public assistance to care for his family. It has been widely reported that Rep. Radel voted in favor of a measure to permit states to drug test recipients of food stamps, even as he was using drugs himself. It is less widely known that in 2011 Florida passed legislation that required recipients of cash assistance to be drug tested. The law was in effect for four months, until federal judges halted the program on constitutional grounds. During the time in which the program was in effect, only 2.6 percent of those tested were identified as in violation of the law. But Rep. Radel would likely have been among the 2.6 percent who came up with failed drug tests. EmploymentRep. Radel should be grateful that his net worth largely comes from his business interests and inheritance and not from work. An employer can lawfully fire an employee with a felony conviction, of course. While a number of public figures from both parties have called upon Rep. Radel to resign from the House of Representatives, it is by no means clear that his colleagues will force him out of his seat. As for finding a new job, while the unemployment rate for felons is not officially collected, all estimates are that the rate is quite high. Some have suggested that the rate is as high as 70 to 75 percent. The Center for Economic and Policy Research estimated that not counting the large population of ex-offenders lowered the employment rate for all males by 1.5 to 1.7 percent.Felons are not allowed to hold state government jobs in Florida. Furthermore, in 2011 Florida passed legislation making all state employees subject to drug tests. That legislation is currently tied up in the courts. It appears that when the dust is settled, at least some state employees will be subject to drug testing. Many private employers either cannot or will not consider someone with a felony record. Felons applying for a license in certain regulated fields like real estate or cosmetology will have their applications judged on a case-by-case basis. Good luck getting a job working in a pharmacy with a drug conviction. VotingRep. Radel should be grateful that he will still be allowed to vote. In Florida a voter who is convicted of a felony is automatically removed from the voter rolls. They can apply for reinstatement after their sentence has been completed. If Rep. Radel had been convicted of a felony, not only would he have been disenfranchised, as a public official convicted of a felony, but he would also have to wait seven years after the end of his sentence to apply for restoration of his rights. No such civil penalty is levied against someone convicted of a misdemeanor. Keep your chin up and be grateful, Rep. Radel. You may have put yourself in a tough situation, but the fallout could have been much worse. A low- or moderate-income person arrested in your hometown under precisely the same circumstances could tell you so. René Bryce-Laporte is the Principal at Bryce-Laporte Information & Consulting, focusing on helping low- and moderate-income Americans find social and economic opportunity. For the past 17 years, René has helped these Americans earn more, keep more of what they earn and grow their assets for the long-term."
