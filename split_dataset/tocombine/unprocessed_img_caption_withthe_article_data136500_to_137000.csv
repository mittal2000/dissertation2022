When we recently discussed this year's family Thanksgiving dinner, he of course snuck Paula into the conversation. I know what this means: He's secretly hoping I'll make a Paula Deen recipe and turn his fantasy into a reality. So it got me wondering: How much butter could POSSIBLY be required to make an all-Paula Thanksgiving dinner? Would we even be able to afford buying that amount of butter? Is there enough butter stocked in the world's supermarkets? To answer this question, I browsed Paula's full collection of Thanksgiving recipes to curate an all-Paula menu that's representative of a reasonable Thanksgiving meal. (I.e. I didn't cheat and load the menu with all of her most heavily buttered dishes.) I added up every tablespoon of butter in every recipe, and also accounted for other questionable ingredients that might cause one to have a heart attack. So now, behold: ALL OF THE BUTTER YOU NEED TO COOK A PAULA DEEN THANKSGIVING. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the menu for the big reveal of the grand total.

Frank Schaefer, of Lebanon Pa., walks back to the trial after a lunch break at Camp Innabah, a United Methodist retreat, in Spring City Pa. Tuesday, Nov.19, 2013. A jury of his pastoral peers convicted Schaefer on Monday of breaking his vows by officiating his gay sons' Massachusetts wedding in 2007. Schaefer could face punishment ranging from a reprimand to a suspension to losing his minister's credentials. (AP Photo/Chris Knight)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbe752000009900ff70de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“I didn’t do this to make a rebellious statement against the church,” Rev. Franks Schaefer said on Friday, reflecting on the action taken by a United Methodist Church jury of fellow pastors that last week sentenced him to a 30-day suspension after convicting him of violating church law for having officiated over his son’s same-sex wedding in 2007. At the end of the 30-day period, the Lebanon, Penn., pastor will be defrocked unless he renounces same-sex marriage, including his own son’s marriage.“I said to the jury, ‘Look, all of this, in the last few weeks, has really outed me to the world in terms of where I stand on my theology,’” he told me in an interview on SiriusXM Progress. “I have become an advocate for the LGBT community. I can no longer be a silent supporter.”Schaefer described his statements to the jury as a ""moment of honesty"" in which he challenged the leadership of the nation's largest mainline Protestant denomination, which preaches that homosexuality is ""not compatible with Christian teaching."" He said he’d marry any other gay or lesbian couples who want to be married while he is a still a pastor. So far, none have come forward, but he has until December 18.“I cannot fathom how I would change my mind in that time or in any time,” Schaefer said. “To me this is discrimination. It’s not right. So many people have been hurt. Not just my son -- my children -- but thousands of gay, lesbian bisexual, transgender people have been hurt by the church and by society. It has to stop. We’ve got to realize what we’re doing here with our theology, our doctrine, and really, our hate speech.”The two counts of which he was found guilty go back to Schaefer having officiated over his gay son’s wedding in 2007 in Massachusetts. Schaefer’s son, Tim Schaefer, had come out to him in 2000, when the pastor spoke to his son after an anonymous caller told him his son was gay and was contemplating suicide.“We said to him, 'You are made in the image of God just like everyone else,'” Schaefer said, thinking back to when his son first described his struggles with his homosexuality. “So when he asked me in 2007, ‘Dad, would you do my wedding?’ I was just honored.”Listen to the interview below:"

(Marjie Lambert/Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb303181f00002e0123bb54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How well run is your state? It can be difficult to objectively assess the quality of a state’s management. The economy and standard of living can be affected by decisions made decades ago, forces outside the control of the state’s government and administrators, as well as the government’s own actions.Every year, 24/7 Wall St. tries to answer this question by conducting an extensive survey of every state. To determine how well states are managed, we examined their financial data, as well as the services they provide and their residents’ standard of living. This year, North Dakota is the best-run state in the country for the second year in a row, while California is the worst-run for the third year in a row.CLICK HERE TO SEE THE BEST AND WORST RUN STATES. Identifying appropriate criteria to compare the 50 states can be challenging because they vary so much. Some states have abundant natural resources, while others rely on services or innovation. A few have been burdened by struggling industries. Some are more rural, while others are more urban. Because of such differences, a spending or tax policy that can be beneficial in one state can be disastrous in another.Many of the best-run states in the nation benefit from an abundance of natural resources. North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, and Texas, among the best-run states, are all among the states with the greatest concentration of GDP in the mining industry, which includes activities such as oil and natural gas extraction, as well as coal mining. The presence of this industry benefits states in several ways. North Dakota and Texas led the nation in real GDP growth in 2012, while Alaska has used its oil revenue to establish a permanent fund that pays residents an annual dividend.The housing crisis has had a major negative impact on a number of the worst-run states. It caused a drastic decline in construction employment in states like Arizona, California, and Nevada. Many of these lost jobs have yet to be replaced. In the hardest-hit states, this has resulted not only in worsening unemployment, but increased poverty and budget shortfalls. Although the economies of these states have largely improved, the residual effects of the housing crisis remain.While these can be considered extenuating circumstances, the fact is that each state must deal with the cards it is dealt. Governments must plan for worst-case scenarios, including the collapse of an industry. Several resource-rich states have squandered their advantages and rank poorly on our list. Good governance involves raising and spending enough to provide for the well-being of the population without risking the state’s long-term stability.To determine how well the states are run, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed hundreds of data sets from dozens of sources. We looked at each state’s debt, revenue, expenditure, and deficit to determine how well it was managed fiscally. We reviewed taxes, exports, and GDP growth, including a breakdown by sector, to identify how each state was managing its resources. We looked at poverty, income, unemployment, high school graduation, violent crime and foreclosure rates to assess the well-being of the state’s residents.While each state is different, the best-run states share certain characteristics, as do the worst run. For example, the populations of the worse-off states tended to have lower standards of living. Violent crime rates in these states were usually higher and residents were much less likely to have a high school diploma.The worst-run states also tended to have weak fiscal management reflected in higher budget shortfalls and lower credit ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poors.The better-run states tended to display stable fiscal management. Pensions were more likely to be fully funded, debt was lower, and budget deficits smaller. Credit ratings agencies also were much more likely to rate the well-run states favorably. Only two poorly run states received a perfect credit rating from either agency. California and Illinois, which are ranked worst and third worst, received the lowest ratings from both agencies.The states that were well-managed also tended to have lower unemployment rates. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates ranked as the best-run states. California, Illinois, and Nevada — the states with the highest unemployment rates as of 2012 — were among the five worst-run states.Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that worst-run states tended to have better fiscal management. They have weak fiscal management.These are the worst-run states in America, according to 24/7 Wall St."

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3030a3c000066000c43b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. housing regulator has been investigating the activities of a small California not-for-profit that bought hundreds of foreclosed homes through a federally backed program intended to help local communities hurt by the housing bust, according to government documents reviewed by Reuters.The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of the Inspector General late last year began probing San Diego-based Heartland Coalition's participation in the ""First Look"" program in Las Vegas and other U.S. cities, according to a redacted investigation report and a letter from the regulator in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.The Inspector General's spokeswoman, Marta Rivera Metelko, declined to say whether the investigation is still active. Reuters could not determine the specific focus of the probe.According to the documents and a review of local property records in Las Vegas, the charity flipped a significant number of the homes to investors, generating millions of dollars in profits for those financing Heartland's activities with relatively short-term loans.The First Look program, set up in the aftermath of the financial crisis, helps nonprofits and local communities buy foreclosed homes from U.S. banks at a discount, with the expectation that they would then renovate them and first try to sell the houses to low- and moderate-income families or to investors who would rent to such families. It is unclear whether Heartland initially tried to sell the properties it had acquired to such families before going to investors.The goal of the program is to promote neighborhood stabilization and does not prohibit the reselling of properties to investors.Still, Heartland, according to one real estate investor that bought several homes from the charity, did not ask what the buyers intended do with the homes.There is no indication that Heartland violated any laws or regulations.The probe started after Heartland was suspended in August 2012 by the program's administrator, the nonprofit National Community Stabilization Trust (NCST), according to the documents. The NCST said it suspended Heartland for spending too little on renovations and for not allowing local families enough time to buy the homes, especially in Las Vegas. The Inspector General's office declined in May to provide Reuters with a copy of the suspension order because an investigation was ongoing.Heartland founder Mark Hanson, 69, a retired school administrator with a Ph.D. in education from Claremont Graduate University, said he was not aware of the investigation and that his group's suspension, which is still in place, was unwarranted.In a statement, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said, ""It is our understanding that where buyer inconsistencies have arisen in conjunction with First Look property transfers, NCST has acted responsibly to resolve issues.""A former NCST employee, who declined to be identified, told Reuters that while First Look always permitted the resale of homes to investors who would rent them out, the main goal of the program was to get bank-owned homes resold to buyers who intended to live in them.JOBS MISSIONHanson, who formed Heartland in 1997 to primarily help poor families in the San Diego area, said he isn't concerned about who bought the homes the nonprofit acquired in Las Vegas and other cities as long as it helped stabilize neighborhoods.""Selling homes to low-income (families) was never our mission,"" Hanson said. ""Our mission was to create jobs,"" by hiring workers to renovate homes.Gabe Del Rio, chief operating office for Community Housing Works, another San Diego not-for-profit that has relied mainly on bank loans to buy dozens of homes through the First Look program, said his group long has emphasized reselling homes to families as opposed to potential landlords.Heartland, which was one of some 350 nonprofits participating in the program, bought more than 475 bank-owned homes through First Look and 714 foreclosed homes in total since 2010, according to property research firm RealtyTrac.For graphic: http://link.reuters.com/dar64vThe NCST declined to provide a list of the participating nonprofits. Some participants that Reuters independently identified, and the former NCST employee, said most groups bought only about a couple of dozen homes on average.NCST President Craig Nickerson said Heartland was suspended after the NCST investigated complaints from local real estate representatives in Las Vegas about the nonprofit early last year. He declined to provide a copy of the suspension order.He added that any problems with Heartland were isolated, noting that about 14,000 homes have been sold to participating nonprofits and community groups under the program and that 91 percent of those homes have been resold to people who planned to live in them.""The Trust has confidence that the vast majority of nonprofits conduct their activities consistent with their stated missions,"" Nickerson said.BIG BUYERHeartland, which historically has taken in less than half-a-million dollars in annual charitable contributions, borrowed millions of dollars from private financiers between October 2011 and August 2012 to buy more than 247 bank-owned homes and condominiums under First Look in Las Vegas alone, according to a review of the group's financial documents and website.About 35 percent of those homes were then resold to hedge funds, local investors and out-of-town buyers, living as far away as Belgium, Canada and Hawaii, according to Heartland's property transactions and interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with the group and the First Look program.It is not clear how many of the homes sold to investors were rented out to low and moderate income residents in Las Vegas. The Reuters analysis did not look at homes purchased by Heartland in Phoenix and California.In some cases, the nonprofit did not ask what the buyer intended to do with the homes sold in Las Vegas. For example, Anthony Hynes, whose Newport Beach, California investment fund bought seven single-family homes and condominiums from Heartland, said he did not know his firm was purchasing properties from a nonprofit, nor did anyone ask whether his firm would rent the houses to poor families.The buying and selling of Las Vegas homes last year produced gross profits of between $5.8 million and $11 million for Heartland and its investors, the analysis shows based on an the average resale price for foreclosed homes in Las Vegas. Several of the more than half-dozen private financiers that funded Heartland's purchases said the loans, which were often for less than a year, generated attractive returns of between 8 percent to 10 percent.In a 2012 financial filing sent recently to the Internal Revenue Service, Heartland said its own net proceeds from home sales were $3.18 million. That is more than eight times its 2011 net proceeds of $383,122.Hanson said that up until 2011 he had no salary from Heartland apart from a $10,000 stipend in 2004 to assist survivors of California wildfires. In 2012 he received compensation of $50,850, up from $37,500 in 2011.(Reporting By Matthew Goldstein and Emily Flitter; Editing by Martin Howell and Tim Dobbyn)"

That the hypnotic effect of ""the cape"" is about to unfold. That the Funk is about to make people feel good, maybe even inciting someone to stand precariously on the edge of an upper balcony and dance. At best, one would expect to get a brand new bag out of The Funk Embassy. But instead, a fusion of Blues, Soul, Rock, Jazz, R&B, a bit of hip hop, and a bit of rap is what one gets. But, please, please, please don't fret because this is the stuff that Funk is made of.But to understand this point, we have to back step a bit. We have to go back to the rural south of 1940s when the Mojo men migrated northward to cities like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York. Rural musical customs, cultivated in places like the Mississippi Delta, soon transformed the rural blues into the urban blues. By the mid 60s, the amalgamated musical happenings in the big cities eventually led to the mojo becoming the funk. It would not be far stretched to find several types of American roots influences embedded in the ""stank"", a term commonly used in Funk circles implying sexual licentiousness.The Funk Embassy's new eight track album Shinning On was created by Thierry Matrat. The members of this group all flock together by the same musical current, their love for American roots music and awareness of early soul-funk recordings. Soulful singer Ron Littlejohn (lead singer) and the gospel funk of Alana Bridgewater transport Thierry's vision into a musical collaboration. And if the core meaning of funk is making something out of nothing, then the fifteen musicians on this album did just that. For this reason, they do live-up to their chosen moniker, delegates of a musical past.The first track on the EP Shining On is a soulful blues song with a smooth vocal relationship between the male and female emphasizing a message of self-determination and offering a spiritual uplift in the face of naysayers. The next track ""Seems Like Yesterday"" quickly shifts into a 70s, 80s, R&B, Hip Hop revival--turntables and all--and a James Brown-esque rap sermon. The closest the album gets to ""stank"" comes along on the third track where the sex-drenched vocalists get down and dirty on ""Light Me Up''. A nostalgic jazzy tune with a little bit of spoken word comes along toward the end of the effort. But the closing moment is a groovy rock and roll piece ""Emma Lee"" a song about overcoming the Femme Fatale archetype, which has a uncanny resemblance to The Rolling Stone's ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"".One could say the EP is retro, or perhaps even stuck in a time warp. Maybe the Funk Embassy started off wanting to get funky, but ended up not quite getting what they wanted. And if James Brown resurrected and performed these songs, he might turn away from some and go on to the next before he lost his audience.You can listen to Ron Littlejohn & The Funk Embassy's album Shining On on BandCamp.

The EPA has support from Democratic-leaning states, like Massachusetts and New York, and from environmental groups.""It would be both a big deal and somewhat unsurprising if EPA loses both Clean Air Act cases,"" said Richard Frank, an environmental law professor at the University of California at Davis School of Law. Such rulings would reflect a dilution of the deference that courts generally show government agencies in interpreting statutes, he added.The cases do not challenge whether the EPA can regulate pollutants, such as greenhouse gases, but instead how it uses the Clean Air Act to regulate a wide range of them.The EPA's authority to interpret the statute broadly is vital to its mission in the face of resistance from Republicans and a handful of Democrats in Congress and some state governments. In the climate change context in particular, the Clean Air Act is the EPA's main tool for tackling greenhouse gas emissions after the U.S. Senate rejected a cap-and-trade bill in 2010.The Supreme Court rulings are unlikely to have a direct impact on President Barack Obama's sweeping Climate Action Plan, which was unveiled in June, legal experts say, in part because the EPA will be using its authority under parts of the law not at issue in the cases. But decisions against the EPA could pose obstacles to the way it rolls out its rules.In the first case, to be argued on Dec. 10, the nine justices will consider the legality of a rule that regulates air pollution that crosses state lines.The second case, expected to be scheduled for oral argument in February, concerns a challenge to the Obama administration's first wave of regulations targeting heat-trapping greenhouse gases.The court is due to issue rulings in both cases by the end of June.INTER-STATE POLLUTIONThe EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, meant to take effect in January 2012, would have set limits on nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from coal-fired power plants in 28 states that emit pollutants in the eastern part of the country that directly affect air quality in other states, generally referred to as ""upwind states.""An alliance of industry groups and 15 states, in addition to companies like Southern Co, Peabody Energy Corp and American Electric Power Inc, challenged the rule, and it was never implemented. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit determined in August 2012 that the rule was invalid on multiple grounds.Under the worst-case scenario for the government, the Supreme Court could weaken the EPA's power to bring recalcitrant states into line, legal experts said.In the Obama administration's petition asking for Supreme Court review of the cross-state rule, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said that if the D.C. Circuit decision stood, it would ""gravely undermine"" enforcement of the Clean Air Act, delaying the ability of downwind states to comply with air standards and making it nearly impossible for those states to meet deadlines.A ruling against the EPA could also encourage states to resist other EPA proposals.""If the Supreme Court pushes back against the EPA and says the EPA has to give the states the first chance to address the problem, that gives the states more leverage,"" said Jonathan Martel, a partner at law firm Arnold & Porter LLP, who represents business interests in air pollution cases.CLIMATE CHANGE RULESIn the climate change case, the Supreme Court agreed last month to consider a single question of the many raised by nine different coalitions of industry groups, such as the American Petroleum Institute, and 16 states, including Texas and Virginia. They appealed a June 2012 ruling by the appeals court in Washington upholding the first suite of EPA rules aimed at tackling climate change.The justices will weigh only whether the agency has authority to regulate greenhouse gases under a permitting program for stationary sources of pollution.A loss for the EPA could remove a whole category of pollutants, not just greenhouse gases, from the so-called ""prevention of serious deterioration"" or PSD program, which requires any new or modified major polluting facility to obtain a permit before any new construction is done if it emits ""any air pollutant.""Under the program, the operators have to show that they are using the best available technology available to reduce emissions of the covered pollutants.It may not be all bad news for the EPA. The court passed up a chance to review the agency's determination that greenhouse gases, the driving force behind climate change, are a pollutant that needs to be regulated under the Clean Air Act.Wins for the EPA in both cases would not, however, lead to any major shift in the law in its favor, experts say.""Everything continues to be hard work"" for the EPA, said Sean Donahue, an attorney who represents the Environmental Defense Fund. ""There's tremendous resistance at every turn."" (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Ros Krasny, Howard Goller and Nick Zieminski)"
