When I was in my early 20s, I fell asleep pretending to be an inspiring guest on Oprah. Lately however, I fall asleep having hypothetical conversations with my future teenage daughter. Addie is officially closer to teen than toddler and some conversations have already started to bubble up about boobs, boys and tampons. If it's true that you're supposed to start talking to your kids about the things they need to know five years before they need to know it -- future teenage Addie in my head is educated about a lot.Related: 10 things a mother should NEVER say to her daughterHowever, I've realized that oftentimes, the advice I'd give a current teenager wouldn't be the same advice I'd give to Addie in 8 years. Maybe because I'm the one responsible for her? I don't care if your kid dresses like a tramp and has a misspelled tattoo at 18, but I do care when it comes to mine.I'd like to think I'd just lay it all out there, very matter-of-factly without any reverse psychology or ulterior motives. I've made mistakes, and chances are Addie is going to make a few, too; it would feel hypocritical to tell her not to do drugs (which she totally shouldn't) but if she does, she should only do ones from trusted sources (bad drugs are a terrible thing, future Addie).I mean, see my conundrum? Am I projecting too much of myself onto her when she'll never actually go down the same paths I did, and will telling her all this damage her for life? Or is telling her the difference between a shot and a sidecar subliminally giving her permission to go forth and experiment? If she tries new and unusual things, I want her to at least try them safely. But in reality, I don't want her to do anything illegal or dangerous. WHAT DO I DO? So here they are, some of the hypothetical conversations I've had with Addie.Heaven help me.1. DrugsDrugs are really expensive, and not really worth it. There are also all different kinds -- some high quality, some not so much. Using them incorrectly will make you really sick and eventually, despite your best efforts -- drugs will make you dumb.Maybe not full-on dumb, but it will GREATLY diminish your potential.Hopefully, you've learned enough from Dad's legal shows by now to never carry drugs with you and never, EVER have drug paraphernalia in your car. (More on this when we get to the section entitled ""jail."")Basically, drugs? SO EXPENSIVE. So dangerous. Don't do it. We'll talk about how I know this later.2. JailIf you get arrested I am not coming to bail you out. This isn't some grand ""You got yourself into this mess, you can get yourself out"" type of thing, it's just what my mom said to me and you know what?Knowing no one is going to come bail you out is the best motivation to never get arrested in the first place.Remind me to tell you about the time I pushed my boyfriend out of the way to keep him between the cops and me. He'd been to jail before. I had a perfect record to maintain.3. ClothesDon't dress trashy.Don't dress to attract unwanted attention.Wear what makes you happy.Develop your own sense of style that doesn't rely on how much of your cleavage is showing or how short your shorts are.Cute does not mean slutty, summer does not mean skin hanging out and modest does not mean frumpy or old.The way you dress will directly impact the way you are treated in every single situation in life. You deserve to be respected, so dress to be respected.4. Peer PressureWhen it comes to peer pressure, LIE YOUR FACE OFF.Cigarettes: ""Aw man, I tried one once and it made my asthma so bad I had to go to the ER, you don't want that on your hands, do you?""Drinking: If you're holding a Red Solo Cup, no one should be trying to get you a drink, even if you just have Coke in it. If they taste it and call your bluff, tell them they're too drunk to taste it. You only have to fake it for so long before everyone else is so far gone that you won't even have to worry about elaborate lies.Drugs: ""Dude, that stuff is cut with peanuts and I'm totally allergic.""Shoplifting: ""My mom said if I need a thrill, she'd shove me off a cliff.""Basically, you can blame everything on your dad and me if it gets you out of a sticky situation. PLEASE, BLAME US FOR EVERYTHING.""No, my dad's a lawyer and my mom has rage issues,"" will solve a lot of peer pressure problems.5. PornographyDon't waste your time.I understand the temptation and the curiosity but A) it will just make you feel terrible about yourself and B) SO FAKE.When you eat bad food your body can and will get rid of it by any means necessary, however when you take bad stuff into your mind, your mind cannot get rid of it. It cannot be unseen and images like those are not ones you want floating around in your brain. Promise.6. Tattoos and PiercingsI have them. Your dad has them. Pretty much everyone has them these days. Our church says you shouldn't get them, and you probably shouldn't -- but in the event that you do, make sure it's awesome.Make an appointment with a reputable studio, don't just do it on a whim while in Vegas.Pay good money for a real artist, this is going to be on you FOREVER, treat it as such. Make sure it's something that has DEEP meaning to you, not just something you like at the moment or something that is trendy (echoed by every girl who currently sports a faded butterfly tattoo on her lower back.)Same with piercings. Do them safely please.7. SexSex is awkward, it complicates things and it can smell funny. That being said, it can also be pretty damn spectacular when you're with a person who loves and treasures you. There will be a lot of times when sex seems like a really good idea, but I can promise you you'll never regret saying no to the multiple opportunities you will have, however you will regret saying yes to almost all of them.Say no? Nothing much happens. Say yes? Say hello to the possibility of pregnancies, diseases and reputations.8. Mean Girls and GossipDon't get sucked into it.Walk away.Be the bigger person.Stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.It may not be popular in the moment, but it will show you who your true friends are. Words hurt, so bad. Screw, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me."" Words can and do hurt worse than all the sticks an stones in the world, don't be the one uttering them.9. Your PeriodEvery girl gets it, don't be ashamed to ask for tampons or pads if you need them. Always be ready to offer one if needed. If you talk about it like it's a giant secret to be ashamed of, people will treat it like a giant secret you should be ashamed of.Treat it like something we all have to do like showering or brushing our teeth? It's no big deal. Also, buy the good pads and tampons; yes, there's a difference.10. Learn Everything, Respect EveryoneNever think you're too good to learn something from someone else.If you have a chance to learn something? Learn it.Don't mess around in school, take it seriously, respect your teachers.Respect your elders.Respect differences.Don't be a jerk, even in the face of a hundred jerks.For 7 more hypothetical conversations with my future teenage daughter, visit Babble!MORE ON BABBLE 20 simple ways to show your kids you love them 25 things every kid should experience 12 things your child MUST see you do 10 ways teens are just like toddlers"

3,PARENTING,Talking to Your Kids About Anthony Weiner's Penis,"Lea Grover, Contributor
Writer and toddler-wrangler at Becoming SuperMommy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/talking-to-your-kids-abou_us_5b9d64ede4b03a1dcc877756,"So here we are, about two decades into the Internet as we know it. And that means that you'd think we'd have gotten a little smarter about it. Oh, how wrong you'd be.",2013-08-01,"NEW YORK, NY - JULY 11: New York City Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner attends the Council of Senior Centers and Services of NYC Mayoral Forum at New York University on July 11, 2013 in New York City. Weiner is in the race to succeed three-term Mayor Michael Bloomberg after he was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 following the revelation of sexually explicit online behavior. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d64ed24000050005392ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Internet is a new media. And like all new media, it's an opportunity to behave very, very badly. Since the dawn of time, new media has given us new ways to come up with poor behavior.Was the Venus of Willendorf a sexual totem? Was she intended to arouse paleolithic men? Was the Marquis de Sade expressing the desires of an entire class of horny and angry aristocrats? Was Barbara Eden's belly button a siren luring young people into heinous acts of degradation? I don't know. But I do know quite a bit about online porn.Once upon a time, you could publish pictures (and later, video!) of people engaging in all sorts of sexual acts, and you could charge other people a great deal of money to look at those pictures. People selling those pictures became millionaires. People taking those pictures found markets for every bizarre kink or perversion known (or previously unknown) to human kind. A gigantic industry was born. Nowadays, Internet porn isn't the same sort of moneymaking enterprise it was 15 years ago. Nowadays, it's hard to make money taking dirty pictures of people and charging other people to see them. That's because nowadays people make their OWN porn. The inventors of chat roulette never had to come up with content. Their users did all the work for them.The point is, people aren't particularly bright about publicity and technology. You'd think that after more than half a century of exposure, we would have learned our lesson about being stupid on television... but no. Anybody remember elimiDATE?The Internet is worse. Especially because, as with most new technology, the older generations (i.e. parents) have no idea what's actually going on with it. I definitely remember my friends teaching their parents how to set up nanny-ware features on the family PCs, rendering that software totally useless. And then they headed off to look at porn.So here we are, about two decades into the Internet as we know it. And that means that you'd think we'd have gotten a little smarter about it.Oh, how wrong you'd be.The fact is, people assume that if they ""discover"" something for themselves (like Internet porn, or Twitter, or chat roulette), nobody else (except for their partners in cyber-naughtiness) will ever find out about it. They're wrong pretty much 100 percent of the time.This brings me to this insanity around Anthony Wiener. He had no business sending pictures of his penis around on the Internet. That's just plain reckless, not to mention that it's sexual harassment. But the fact of matter is that, while this is no doubt embarrassing for him and his family, it's not a big deal in the scheme of politics and scandal. Was he caught having sex with prostitutes after running on an anti-prostitution campaign? No. Was he caught having sex with men after making a career as an anti-gay spokesperson? No. Was he caught overseas with an exotic mistress instead of wandering around in the woods? No. He was caught engaging in asinine behavior online, behind his wife's back.This isn't a question of inappropriate sexual behavior. (Well, it is, but that's a separate issue entirely.) It's a question of having any kind of understanding about your personal media, and your publicity.So what do you tell your kids about Anthony Weiner's naughty pictures? You tell them that the Internet if full of stupid people doing stupid things, but that they're still REAL people, and those things can still have REAL consequences in the outside world. Both for you and whoever else you might involve in your self absorbed shenanigans.The fact that the Internet gives us access to a whole new universe of potential friends or victims, while maintaining our relative anonymity, is unprecedented. And we've never had to deal with the cultural shift in where and how we live our lives. The fact is that despite having physical places to live and work, we exist on the Internet just as constantly. We tweet every moment of every day. We have laptops and tablets, we have WiFi hot-spots and guest computers in hotels and hospitals. We are just as much creatures of the Internet as of the ""real"" world. But we don't teach our kids how to be citizens of cyberspace. We just teach them how to be citizens of earth, and that the Internet is somehow different.Well, it turns out that the Internet isn't so different after all. If your wife catches you sending pictures of your junk to ladies online she'll be just as pissed as if she caught you handing a Polaroid to your accountant. It's still an inappropriate picture, and it signifies a breach of trust.So don't just tell your kids that the important politician is in trouble because of his sexual misconduct. The most important lesson is that the Internet is a real place, and that the things they do there, from entering credit card information to bullying other kids to putting potentially compromising pictures of themselves on Twitter, matters. Just as much as it does ""IRL"" when you can't close the browser and make it go away.It doesn't go away. The Internet makes thing much more permanent than the real world. The Internet takes every mistake you've ever made public, opens you up for every criticism and attack. The Internet is, in most ways, worse than the real world.So teach your kids about the Internet and e-citizenship. Teach them not to be stupid about their exhibitionism. When you say or do something mean or stupid in the real world, after a few days or months or years, nobody will remember. If it's online, somebody is going to find out. And they'll probably find a way to use it against you.There is no hiding from the Internet. Pretty soon every grass hut on the savanna is going to have wireless. And everyone online is going to talk about every stupid, public mistake you've ever made. On the Internet, all you need to be instantly famous is to be an embarrassment to yourself.And that is the lesson that I hope we can all take away from this.Originally posted at Becoming SuperMommy"

5,DIVORCE,Divorce Study Indicates That Cost Of Splitting Up Is Top Concern For Divorcing Couples,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce-study_us_5b9d6662e4b03a1dcc878992,Avvo's survey also looked at how many people utilize divorce lawyers versus the number of people who choose to go it alone,2013-08-01,Couples Who Share Housework Are More Likely To Divorce,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a96fd22a000028007af6fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"According to a new survey by legal forum Avvo, couples facing divorce say that the cost of splitting up is their number one concern.Avvo surveyed 890 of their consumer users and 447 attorneys in June 2013 and found that the cost of divorce was the biggest concern for 58 percent of respondents without children. Other top concerns included property division (42 percent), the length of time a divorce would take (27 percent) and alimony (22 percent).For couples with children, cost is second only to custody concerns, which was cited by 53 percent of respondents. “Given that the average divorce costs $15,000, it’s no wonder that cost is a key factor for individuals facing divorce, however we were surprised at how significant a concern it is, and that it largely cuts across all income levels,” Leigh McMillan, vice president of marketing, Avvo, Inc., said in a press release.Avvo's survey also looked at how many people utilize divorce lawyers versus the number of people who choose to go it alone. They found that 65 percent of people use an attorney during divorce, and 35 percent represent themselves without a lawyer or use a DIY service.This isn't the first study to indicate that finances play a big part in divorce. In July 2013, a study by UK law firm Slater & Gordon showed that the cost of splitting up was one of the top 10 reasons couples stay together. And another study by Kansas State University found that couples who argue about money, especially early in their relationships, are more likely to divorce.Click through the slideshow below to see even more fascinating findings from divorce studies.Keep in touch!
