(Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e3e48240000500095647d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Robin Williams has been beloved in the households of Americans for countless years. Adults, children and teenagers have loved, related to and laughed at the varying roles he has played on-screen. Really, Robin did a little something for everyone. As is now evident (to those unaware before), Williams struggled with his mental health, and deep depression. And now, he has taken his own life -- and whether you want your children to hear this news or not, at some point, they will. And so, it should be you, as a parent, who talks to them -- especially if your own child has struggled with depression, or other mental health issues. Why? Because they know his face, his (many) voices, his laughter. They giggled through Flubber and Jumanji, they loved him in Aladdin, they cried during Patch Adams and Jack. I know I did. At some point, they have looked up to him or his characters. Especially for someone who has struggled with depression or suicidal thoughts, losing a well-known figure to suicide, while incredibly tragic, can also exacerbate feelings of hopelessness in fellow sufferers. For youth, they may be convinced it really WON'T get better. They may relate it to their own struggles, their own feelings. They may get confused, or feel more depressed. They may look at themselves and think, ""Man, didn't he live the dream? Didn't he have everything? Endless talent, millions of fans, a loving family? What does that mean for me?""But Williams' struggle is not their struggle. In fact, we may never know the depth and breadth of his struggles (and it's really not our business). This creates a necessary point of conversation with our youth. Suicide is still the third leading cause of death in young adults, and rates of anxiety and depression are incredibly high. The topic, however uncomfortable or anxiety provoking, should not be ignored. Especially now, when our kids are hearing these words on every news source, and struggling to understand and process them. Especially now, when 17 percent of female high school students and 10 percent of male students have considered suicide. Open the dialogue, and let them know it's okay to talk. Allow them to process the information out loud, and help them to separate themselves and their own struggles from the struggles of others. Remind them of the many people who overcome their struggles with mental illness, as well. Lastly, you can help your child to wrap their head around the news of Williams' passing by explaining that depression can cause a mental block from seeing and feeling hope -- but that just because one has times when they cannot see it, it doesn't mean it isn't here. There is always hope, and there is always help.Learn more about a new endeavor to support teens with Anxiety and Depression at fadforteens.comNeed help?

Twigs speaks to those whose lies are as important as their truths, especially those who can mix the two to create art.",2014-08-18,"CHICAGO, IL - JULY 19: Tahliah Barnett aka FKA Twigs performs onstage during 2014 Pitchfork Music Festival at Union Park on July 19, 2014 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Roger Kisby/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb279e42200004301db9782.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who is FKA Twigs?When the 26-year-old artist emerged onto the stage at the El Rey in Los Angeles earlier this week she wore white '90s street wear with exotic gold chains wrapped around her belly and thighs. A sheer white lingerie robe drooped over her white corset, both saintly and corrupt, like Madonna from the future. Her makeup resembled a manga doll from another planet, her eyes too big and her mouth too small to look quite human. She surveyed up her audience and sneered, seemingly unimpressed. ""I love that she's a performance artist. Like, literally, a performance artist,"" someone close by whispered.And then Twigs began rapping in a Parseltongue hiss. Like Jean Luc Godard's whispering narrator in ""2 or 3 Things I Know About Her,"" a film about a housewife who moonlights as a prostitute. It's an interesting contrast to Beyonce's ""On The Run,"" which begins with a blatant ""Breathless"" knockoff with Bey as Queen, Jay as Gangster. Twigs is narrator, director and star; and she doesn't have to spell it out.FKA Twigs sounds like sex, as it exists online, in your fantasies and in the flesh. At times, her lyrics resemble late night, stream-of-consciousness desires that veer into crazy as they melt into a dream haze. Her verses channel dime novel lust and spiritual transcendence in a single breath. À la The Weeknd, her songs feel like nighttime, though if The Weeknd is a low key party where you're trying to hookup, Twigs is a surreal ChatRoulette rendezvous where you reach total intimacy with a stranger, and then lose each other again. In the first line of ""Pendulum,"" Twigs' second single off her new album LP1, Twigs coos ""I'm a sweet, little love maker."" Is she serious? You could imagine the doe-eyed dollish creature playing into someone's boyish fantasy. And yet there's clearly a sardonic bite, an awareness of her lover's belittlement, especially coming from the woman whose songs earlier snapped, ""I can fuck you better than her."" Twigs, born Tahliah Barnett, is a shapeshifter. And most often, she occupies multiple roles at once. In ""Number,"" she alternates between asking ""Was I just a number to you?"" and ""Was I just a --"" before breaking into the caricatured pouty cry of a cartoon baby doll. She interrupts herself constantly, her multiple personalities all vying for stage time. She's Kate Bush skyping with Aaliyah in the afterlife and the screen keeps glitching.Twigs' chameleon-like habit of swapping voices and personas translates to her similarly protean body language. Twigs -- a nickname she earned for popping joints in her brittle limbs -- was a backup dancer in a former life. See her in Jessie J's ""Do It Like A Dude."" She comments on her past identity in ""Video Girl,"" explaining how she habitually denies being ""the girl from the video"" to various curious parties. ""Was she the girl that's from the video? You lie, you lie, you lie,"" she sings. Twigs lies, denying the fact, and then sings about the encounter, and thus, telling the truth? This is slippery territory. ""I can't recognize me,"" the song ends.But back to the dancing. In one song she's Bollywood... then she's salsa, then hip-hop. Twigs moves like an Egyptian queen, a snake charmer, a stripper, a prima ballerina. She moves through the world and all its cultural rituals at a speed than can only be accessed in the globalized digital age. She flips through real and imagined geographies them like she's surfing the web. As the show progressed it seemed less and less likely that Twigs was made of the same skin and bones as the rest of us. And then suddenly the song ended, and Tahliah Barnett greeted her enraptured crowd. She was shy and awkward, humbled and moved. ""I get nervous when I talk,"" she explained. The audience breathed a collective sigh of relief, realizing that Barnett was playing a role -- or rather, many roles -- and once the lights turned on she was just like us.But, no. Twigs is not a character, not something separate from Barnett. Twigs speaks softly and giggles moments before spreading her legs and grinding hungrily. There's no contradiction. Where Beyonce's feminist is both mogul and mother, Twigs transforms into every horror and fantasy ever projected onto a woman. She's a warrior goddess, a demonic child, a virgin angel. She's Bjork and Ciara and Yolandi Visser and Mariko Mori. She's Cleopatra and Daenerys Targaryen and Sailor Moon. Watching Twig's incessant transmogrification, I was reminded of one of 2014's other best cultural moments, the TV show ""Broad City"", specifically, when Ilana Glazer predicts that ""statistically, we're headed toward an age where everybody's going to be, like, caramel and queer."" Twigs speaks to a new generation of people, of artists, of women, for whom identity operates differently. There are too many tasty options bubbling in the ether from which to select your interests and curate your attributes -- so why choose?Twigs speaks to an age where musical genres are like ingredients best thoroughly mixed and baked. Where human interactions are so heavily mediated, a quest for authentic human connection is not only futile, it's boring. Twigs speaks to those whose lies are as important as their truths, especially those who can mix the two to create art."

4,HEALTHY LIVING,"A Back-to-School Message: Emphasize Childhood Health, Not Obesity","Daniel J. Schultz, ContributorPublic Health Nutritionist, MS, RD",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-back-to-school-message-_b_5683688.html,"New school lunch regulations should not be thought about as a weight management diet, but a roadmap for health for each student involved. Breakfast, lunch and snacks at school allow us as a nation to demonstrate to millions of children each day what nutritious food looks like.",2014-08-18,White School lunch tray on white background. Milk Bottle with custom design label.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e3ee01f0000510021edf5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta released a powerful anti-obesity PSA showing a man suffering a heart attack in the ER, which then progresses to an intense flashback to what food choices and activities led to this event. During the PSA you see the man's first person view as an adult, teenager and child. This includes failed attempts to be healthy, food choices of soda, fast food and him choosing to play video games instead exercising. Additionally, the video ends with the mom of the child literally shoving French fries into the kid's mouth. I've been mulling over what to make of the PSA since I watched it. On the one hand, the video is very well done, raises awareness about childhood obesity (over 3 million views on YouTube) and highlights what medical issues chronic consumption of unhealthy food can lead to. Obesity does increase your risk for developing many chronic diseases. In comparison, the always-insightful Dr. Yoni Freedhoff wrote, ""If guilt or shame had any lasting impact on weight or behavior the world would be skinny."" This video tells parents that they are making their kids fat and should be ashamed. The PSA does not touch on obesity issues such as the economics, cultural norms, biochemical factors, or a lack of nutrition education in schools. This PSA also insinuates that only obese children need to eat better and exercise more. Parents do play a role in helping to prevent obesity and can improve their children's health; however, the blame should not be only on them. Again, as Dr. Freedhoff highlighted, ""Childhood obesity is a symptom of a broken environment. Kids haven't changed, the world around them has."" Through my nutrition fieldwork, I've witnessed obese children at school be ostracized by specific interventions. Obese children wrangled up into a classroom to eat lunch and have a nutrition class, with strict supervision to make sure they ate their vegetables. Or public health presentations were the obese child was cherry picked out to give a speech about a healthy school intervention. Obese children are told constantly that they need to eat better. While normal weight children learn that they can eat whatever they want since their skinny. Just because your child is at a normal BMI does not mean that it is healthy for them to consume whatever food they want. Contrary to popular belief, your child can develop chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes later in life, even if they do not become obese. Young athletes are also usually left out of the conversation about healthy eating. What happens when they don't have the strict schedule of playing organized sports? Kids can't outrun their forks forever. This focus just on BMI holds back many larger-scale changes to our environment and policies too. As Andy Bellatti emphasized, ""Until we can have a national conversation about health -- specifically, how it is affected by our food systems, environment, and politics -- instead of weight, it will be hard to make the case for sound policy that promotes our well-being, regardless of our numbers on the scale."" Especially when a policy impacts children, such as the new school food regulations. I'm still saddened that the simple concept of feeding children the healthiest meal possible at school has turned into a political debate. New school lunch regulations should not be thought about as a weight management diet, but a roadmap for health for each student involved. Breakfast, lunch and snacks at school allow us as a nation to demonstrate to millions of children each day what nutritious food looks like. Just as we don't expect parents to know the proper techniques to teach math or science for their children, school lunches can also help lead the conversation on proper food choices back home. Again, parents should not be blamed for a lack of nutrition education or cooking knowledge. This is part of a cycle of multiple generations with no nutrition education and shifting cultural norms and environments which favor unhealthy food. Why would we expect parents to know the best practices to feed their children if no one has taught them how to? As a nation, we need to accept that we caused this health problem together. No positive impact can be accomplished by putting blame on individual families. At the end of the day, all parents want their children to grow up as healthy as possible. Food plays a crucial role in obtaining that goal. We can simplify our children's health by a number on a scale and focus just on those kids who register as obese. Or, we can make this problem about childhood health and help everyone to realize the importance of good nutrition."

Within weeks, massive fighting was raging across three of the country's 10 states, hundreds of thousands had been displaced from their homes and thousands killed. The intensity of the crisis, coupled with the growing number of displaced families caught in the deadly conflict, left the humanitarian aid system straining to support those most affected and at-risk, including the aid workers themselves. Only four months later, in April, two members of our staff would be killed in a horrific attack on a UN base in the town of Bor, where thousands of South Sudanese civilians had sought shelter.   The IRC was able to begin responding to the needs of tens of thousands of displaced people within the first 72 hours of the crisis. With critical support from the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, we provided primary healthcare, emergency water and sanitation and protection for those most affected by the violence. Yet, in what has become a problem across the humanitarian sector, quickly getting enough money, goods and people into the country to support our programs became a more difficult task -- in part, because of over-stretched resources across an increasing number of concurrent emergencies globally.  With so many disasters -- Central African Republic, Syria, Iraq and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, to name a few -- and such huge needs, it's hard to keep the world's attention in one place for more than a 24-hour news cycle. Once a media darling following its secession from Sudan in 2011, it seems South Sudan now bounces in and out of the headlines according to how bloody the latest battles are. On August 5, another six aid workers were killed, making South Sudan one of the most dangerous places in the world to deliver aid -- yet this tragic news barely made a blip on the radar.  Now, with food insecurity rapidly increasing but fighting less prominent, I fear many are sitting on their hands, awaiting an official declaration of ""famine,"" before doing more. The problem with this is that with each day that passes, more and more people are facing starvation and dying. The UN estimates that 50,000 children in South Sudan could face death in the next few months and 3.9 million at risk of extreme food insecurity. We know that by the time famine in Somalia was declared in 2011, half of the 250,000 victims had already died. We are seeing the same trend of events occurring in South Sudan now.  IRC staff in the country tell me local populations are already scavenging in forests seeking berries, twigs and bark. Already people are wading into chest-high water to gather water-lilies, which contain no nutritional value, as their only source of food. Already people are eating husks of last year's corn harvest.  In Ganyliel, a remote corner of Unity State, tens of thousands of people have fled into a village where the IRC has been working for 20 years. Our staff -- many of whom have been with us for over 10 years -- opened their doors to these fleeing families, but are now facing a hunger crisis alongside the displaced. The World Food Program is delivering food by airdrop to Ganyliel, but can only afford to drop food rations once a month that are meant to last 15 days. The IRC, too, is having to fly in food rations to help feed our own staff so they can continue providing life-saving care to their neighbors and friends.With needs so great already, it shouldn't take an official declaration of the F-word to make the world take note. Although the odds often seem insurmountable, I see each day what we can accomplish: children treated for malnutrition, cash grants given to families to purchase food in the market, groups of women helping each other cope with the horrors they have seen and felt. This is what the world needs to remember when it seems there are too many hopeless crises and that we can't possibly ever do enough.This post is part of a five-part series produced by The Huffington Post, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, and the NGO alliance InterAction to commemorate World Humanitarian Day. World Humanitarian Day (August 19) honors aid workers who have lost their lives helping the millions of people affected by disasters around the world.

Schneider, who was friends with Williams for 20 years after the two first met on the set of ""Saturday Night Live"" in the 1980s, took to Twitter last week to discuss the actor's death. Now that we can talk about it. #RobinWilliams was on a drug treating the symptoms of Parkinson's.

Check out all the Big Pharma Trolls climbing out from under the sludge! See how ugly they are!Williams' wife, Susan Schneider, who has no relation to Rob Schneider, revealed the 63-year-old was dealing with the early stages of Parkinson's disease before he died. However, she maintained that the actor -- who battled substance abuse on and off since the 1980s and checked into rehab last month to maintain his sobriety -- was sober at the time of his death. ""Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson's Disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly,"" she wrote in a statement released to the media. Williams was found dead in his Tiburon, California, home on Aug. 11. The cause of death was determined to suicide by asphyxiation."

On Monday, August 18, a video emerged of a live performance of the Sia-written ""Perfume"" that some claim sounds like Sia's vocals playing (whilst Spears simply clutches the microphone). Billboard speculates that Sia's track was likely used ""as an in-monitor guide when she sings ... [and] was put into the house mix, making for an embarrassing accident.""Of course, this comes on the heels of of various lip-syncing accusations that Spears' manager, Adam Leber, confirmed in a recent interview with Medium. “To put on the show that she puts on, it’s virtually impossible to sing the entire time and do what she does,” he said. “She’s singing on every song, basically, when she has the ability to sing. There’s no way you can dance for 90 minutes straight and sing the entire time.”Okay? So, yes, there is some lip-syncing in Las Vegas. Maybe with that low-res Instagram video of ""Perfume,"" or maybe not. But are we really so shocked that maybe she is not the best singer? Hello, un-Auto-tuned ""Alien"" / basically everything that has happened since the early 2000s. Bless her sweet heart, but the reason to love Britney is not her vocals.We leave you with this."

The article, written by former Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes, sparked backlash from all corners of the web and led to a number of authors asking for all of their previous posts be removed from the site.Now, the polarizing writer has been asked to take an ""indefinite leave of absence"" from his role as chief creative officer of Rooster, an ad agency that he created, in New York.""Gavin's views are his own and do not represent those of the company or its members,"" a Rooster representative said in a statement to AdWeek. ""We are extremely disappointed with his actions and have asked that he take a leave of absence while we determine the most appropriate course of action."" We won't quote McInnes' article here, as the language and points made don't deserve any more of a platform than they've already received. However, Thought Catalog has since published a disclaimer before the piece that reads ""The article you are trying to read has been reported by the community as hateful or abusive content. For more information about our reporting system head to our about page.""Thought Catalog, a publication that previously told The New York Times it is ""absolutely a page-view-driven site,"" has recently come under fire for the types of articles it chooses to publish. In addition to McInnes' article, the site also published a piece last week titled ""Ferguson, Missouri Looks Like A Rap Video"" that led Gawker to call the site a ""white supremacist publication."""

And they have.",2014-08-17,2014-08-13-1000509261001_2013980530001_WilliamShakespeareTheLifeoftheBard.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-13-1000509261001_2013980530001_WilliamShakespeareTheLifeoftheBard-thumb.jpg,"The Utah Shakespeare Festival is truly unique.Founded in 1961 and presenting its first season in 1962, the organizers wanted to create something special. And they have. While all the festivals like the one at Stratford-upon-Avon, Ashland Oregon's Festival and others around the world have many things they can boast about, the Cedar City experience is unique.Festival founder Fred Adams puts it this way:""We are more than just productions; we surround our plays with activities that can fill up the entire vacation day for a patron. Starting in the evening with an in-depth orientation on the play that will be seen that evening, we then offer a free half hour of entertainment designed to put the play-goer in a complimentary mood for the play they are about to enjoy; this is followed the next morning by a compelling talk-back (seminar) on what the patron saw and experienced the night before. This is followed by discussions on the matinee they might have also seen the previous day and then a demonstration on costumes, stage properties or a personal visit with actors from the production. All of this 'surround' experience is designed to provide additional insight and appreciation for the productions viewed. We try to visit with patrons at the Festival every performance... prior to and during intermissions. These personal greetings are designed to let the customer know that he/she is more than a customer to us, we consider them friends and family.""As Fred alluded, all the plays are discussed in some detail beforehand with theatergoers free to ask any and all questions they may have about the play, the characters, or the time in which Shakespeare wrote the play. The next day after the play, in what has been called a ""Literary"" seminar, you can ask about anything you saw or heard, felt or believed and discuss it at length. And on other days the actors spend an hour with those who yearn for even more. Many of the actors said this opportunity to talk with the audience was one of the most unique things about the Cedar City Festival that they cherish.By the way, all of these discussions are free and open to the theater going public.Like Shakespeare events in most venues, the synopses of each play, the cast list, characters in each play, relevant articles, festival news and ""happenings"" are listed. Perusing the festival's site is a great way to start to understand the man and his plays. In addition to Shakespeare's works, Broadway plays and musicals are also offered, but the focus remains on the bard. Ben Johnson, an English playwright, poet, and literary critic of the seventeenth century, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy once said of Shakespeare, ""He was not of an age, but for all time.""According to Amanda Mabillard, author of Why Study Shakespeare? : ""Shakespeare's ability to summarize the range of human emotions in simple yet profoundly eloquent verse is perhaps the greatest reason for his enduring popularity. If you cannot find words to express how you feel about love or music or growing older, Shakespeare can speak for you. No author in the Western world has penned more beloved passages.""This is in part the reason that the producers, artistic directors and managing directors of over thirty-seven Shakespeare festivals and companies met in Washington D.C. over a decade ago to create a new organization called the Shakespeare Theater Association (STA). STA was founded to ""Bridge the gap between scholarship and production...and promote better teaching of Shakespeare in school."" As Cindy Tumiel, at the University of Texas at San Antonio has noted, ""Shakespearean works are required reading for high school English students and a course or two for college students who study writing or literature...Even in prisons, teachers find that Shakespeare offers contemporary connections that open pathways to learning for some of society's most marginalized.""It is no wonder why Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist, and why appreciating his work is so vital to understanding. As Shakespeare said: ""We know what we are, but know not what we may be.""Most of the Utah Festival plays are available until October 18th."
