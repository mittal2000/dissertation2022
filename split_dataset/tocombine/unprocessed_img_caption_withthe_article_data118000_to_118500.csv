(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb75f6024000031005700ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman is a controversial figure in many circles. That includes not only among fans and segments of the media, but also among some on the playing and officiating sides of the game.What I will say in that regard is this: Whatever your opinions are on him, as a commissioner it is hard to deny that he is good at the job he was hired to do. Bettman has grown the revenue of the game while driving a hard bargain in negotiations, all the while doing the equivalent of herding cats in trying to keep team owners in line with his main objectives.On a professional level, I respect Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly even if I don't always agree with some of their decisions. Specially, I take issue with the salutatory neglect they afford to those whom they selected to run the officiating and rule-making sides of the game. Those areas have incompetently and unscrupulously (mis)managed for years, and the commissioner is seemingly disinclined to do anything to bring about badly needed constructive changes. I will discuss some of those issues in my blogs over the summer. Today, however, I prefer to focus on on another side of the story: Gary Bettman the human being. I know that he often gets demonized by people outside hockey and by some players but I believe in my heart that you should judge a person by how he or she treats you, and not by what others say about that person.Back in 1998, the NHL participated in the Olympics for the first time. During the League's schedule break, I was at home early one morning watching the Today show with my wife, who was nine months pregnant with our first child. Show host Katie Couric was talking about how she had lost her husband to colon cancer. As part of the story, she mentioned various symptoms. As she listed the warning signs, I realized that most -- but not all -- were things I had been experiencing. My wife prodded me to go to a doctor and get checked, so I did.On Feb. 22, 1998 at 11 p.m., my son McCauley John Stewart was born. It was far and away the happiest day of my life up until that point. The next morning at 9:30 a.m., I had an appointment with my doctor and was informed that I had Stage 3 colon cancer. There was a large malignant tumor and a secondary tumor at my liver. The doctor told me that had I waited even another few weeks to get checked, the chances of my survival would have been virtually zero. As it was, I would face surgery and chemotherapy, with a significant possibility that I would not make it five years, if that.I am not going to make any cliched analogies to this fight being tougher than anything I experienced on the ice as a player or referee. In those instances, there was always a choice involved. Here, there was no other choice. It wasn't a game. I had to fight the cancer to be alive for my baby boy and for my wife. That was the one thing I focused on at the times I felt too sick to lift my head off the pillow. Giving up meant death. It meant my family grieving and my son not having a father. Plain and simple, those were non-options to me.On June 10, 1998, I underwent surgery to remove the tumors. I hemorrhaged heavily, losing three pints of blood, and went back in on June 12. The situation was grave and I was given last rites. All I could think about the whole time was my three-month-old son and my wife. I couldn't leave them like this. Through the grace of God, I pulled through the surgery and the aftermath. However, the following year, I had to be hospitalized again. I had developed seven hernias from the incisions, which took multiple procedures to correct.When I was very sick and no one was sure how long -- or if -- I would live, Gary Bettman treated me with incredible kindness. He didn't do it for the sake of publicity. There was no personal gain it in for him. He did it from a warm heart that beats beneath the exterior of what people in public or from the other side of a negotiating table get to see.Gary was one of the first people to call me during my ordeal. He told me that, no matter what happened, he would personally make sure that my family was taken care of. He told me not to hesitate to ask if there was anything I needed. I never saw a single bill for my cancer treatments, because the commissioner personally made sure every cent of it was paid by the League. Mr. Bettman is a man to whom I will be forever grateful, whatever my differences with the League about certain rules and the handling of aspects of officiating. It meant a lot to me that he was in attendance at the game in New Jersey on Nov. 13, 1999, when I made my NHL refereeing return.Being able to resume my refereeing career from 1999 to 2003 and officiating my 1,000th career game in my hometown of Boston were things that I often did not think would be possible during the worst stretch of dealing with cancer. I felt blessed just to be alive for my family. To make it back to the NHL was another blessing.I never forget the people who have treated my kindly, just as I have a long memory for those who mistreated me and others about whom I care deeply. In your lowest and most vulnerable times, that's when you learn a lot about the character of those around you. Gary Bettman is a good man.****** Paul Stewart holds the distinction of being the first U.S.-born citizen to make it to the NHL as both a player and referee. On March 15, 2003, he became the first American-born referee to officiate in 1,000 NHL games.Today, Stewart is an officiating and league discipline consultant for the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) and serves as director of hockey officiating for the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). The longtime referee heads Officiating by Stewart, a consulting, training and evaluation service for officials. Stewart also maintains a busy schedule as a public speaker, fund raiser and master-of-ceremonies for a host of private, corporate and public events. As a non-hockey venture, he is the owner of Lest We Forget.Stewart's writings can also be found on HockeyBuzz.com every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. He is currently working with a co-author in writing an autobiography."

Assange marks the two year anniversary on June 19 since he took refuge in Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden over claims of rape and sexual assault. AFP PHOTO / ANDREW COWIE (Photo credit should read ANDREW COWIE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6915642600001123b62d62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With British police still surrounding the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he is holed up, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange joined an international conference call Wednesday to speak out about his complicated and seemingly intractable diplomatic and legal saga.The call came one day ahead of the two-year anniversary of Assange taking refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning in an investigation about alleged sexual offenses. Assange argued his embassy stay is also necessary to avoid extradition to the U.S. for publishing files leaked to him by former U.S. Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning. Although the call addressed his relationship with former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, Assange refused to reveal whether the two have been in any direct contact.""The security situation in relation to myself here at the embassy, where the British government admits to spending more than $10 million so far on police encircling the embassy, and Edward Snowden's situation in Russia and in relation to the National Security Agency, means that I cannot discuss what types of communication we use or do not use,"" said Assange.Assange and WikiLeaks lawyers engineered temporary asylum in Russia for Snowden, who fled to Hong Kong last year before revealing he was the source of leaked NSA reports. The organization's most high-profile success in the last year was getting Snowden the proper travel document for his flight from Hong Kong to Russia. Assange has also signed up as a trustee for the Courage Foundation, which is raising money for Snowden's legal defense. But beyond his role in that group, it's not clear to what extent -- if any -- the WikiLeaks leader has an ongoing relationship with the NSA leaker.Assange declined to answer a question about whether he has any access to Snowden's files. But after a media organization with access to Snowden's files recently published an article on NSA surveillance in two countries, WikiLeaks claimed to identify one country whose name had been redacted. WikiLeaks was vague about its sourcing. ""In relation to an issue revolving around sourcing, as a matter of longstanding policy to protect our sources, we cannot comment,"" he said.Beyond the daring Snowden caper, WikiLeaks has made few of the global splashes it did when relying on the files of Manning, who is now serving the beginning of a 35-year sentence for leaking to the organization. But Assange pointed to files WikiLeaks published in January detailing negotiations for the Trans-Pacifc Partnership, a planned global trade agreement, as one success.Asked whether the group is still relevant, Assange replied, ""I think the best answer to that question was given by the author of Catch-22, when it was put to him that he hadn't eclipsed his novel. And the response, of course, was, 'Neither has anyone else.'""WikiLeaks' role as a publisher has been overshadowed in recent years by the continuing drama surrounding Assange, who is wanted for questioning over sexual offenses in Sweden. Assange referred to that case as ""the Swedish matter.""Assange declined to answer a question he has been asked time and time again since he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy from those charges: why he will not travel to Sweden to answer a prosecutor's questions.Assange's lawyers maintain that he is more than willing to answer questions about the allegations, but that it must happen in Britain. Traveling to Sweden or leaving the Ecuadorian Embassy ""will more than likely be a one-way ticket to the United States, which is continuing an investigation,"" said Assange's U.S. lawyer, Michael Ratner.Anonymous Justice Department officials told The Washington Post in November that Assange was unlikely to face prosecution under the Espionage Act for publishing Manning's leaked files. But Ratner pointed to a U.S. government filing in a related legal case that stated the investigation of WikiLeaks is ""active and ongoing.""""It is against the stated principles of the United States, and I believe the values that are supported by its people, to have a four-year criminal investigation against a publisher,"" said Assange. ""The ongoing existence of that investigation produces a chilling effect not just in relation to Internet-based publishers, but to all publishers.""Another of Assange's lawyers, Jen Robinson, said his team would be making a legal filing in Sweden on Tuesday with ""new information"" about the case there, but declined to elaborate. Assange suggested that he likely would remain at the Ecuadorian Embassy to ward off possible extradition to the U.S. even if the Swedish case was dropped.""I think politically it will enable a more direct confrontation with the U.S. Department of Justice,"" he said. ""There would have to be negotiations, I imagine there would be negotiations between the government of Ecuador and the government of the U.K."""
2,RELIGION,How the LGBT Experience Will Transform the Practice of Mindfulness,"Jay Michaelson, ContributorColumnist@The Daily Beast, Meditation avatar",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-lgbt-experience-w_b_5499928.html,"Does being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have anything to do with practicing mindfulness? Sure. Over the years, many LGBT voices have made themselves heard within Buddhist communities, and have enriched the sangha as a result.",2014-06-17,2014-06-16-Buddha_and_lotuses_Banksy_style785597.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-16-Buddha_and_lotuses_Banksy_style785597-thumb.jpg,"Does being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have anything to do with practicing mindfulness?Sure. Over the years, many LGBT voices have made themselves heard within Buddhist communities, and have enriched the sangha as a result. But the interesting part is just beginning--and it has less to do with inclusion than with insight.Understandably, most LGBT dharma teachers have tended to emphasize ways in which meditation can help promote healing from the traumas of homophobia, and ways in which dharma communities can themselves become more inclusive. For example, Larry Yang, who had led numerous retreats for LGBTQ people, has said that much of his work is ""shepherding ourselves through the collective traumatization that we have as LGBT folks."" Concurrently, some of the most inspiring engaged Buddhist work of the last several decades responded to the ravages of the AIDS plague; for example, Issan Dorsey, a gay Zen roshi, was one of the first religious leaders to reach out to San Francisco's gay community during those horrible years. And there are several LGBTQ sanghas across the country, such as Open Sky, Queer Dharma and Queer Sangha, as well as two Queer Dharma anthologies, and other essays and books. There have also been attempts to find ourselves, or legitimate ourselves, in Buddhist communities and traditions. The Dalai Lama has been asked for his opinions about homosexuality, and reproved for not offering progressive enough ones. (His initial statements, made many years ago, essentially regarded all same-sex intimacy as a form of improper sexual behavior. More recently, he has said that if LGBT people are in wholesome relationships, then sexual intimacy is likewise wholesome.) Buddhist scriptures have been scoured for references to homosexuality (for monks, it is a form of improper sexuality roughly equivalent to other violations of celibacy; for others, the texts vary), while the Japanese tradition of same-sex love among monks and samurais has received some scholarly attention, though like most such traditions, it is scarcely known among laypeople. But this is just the first stage. In fact, the interesting stuff is just getting started.Consider, for example, the unique intersection between queer theory and the dharma. Queer theory, the academic discipline that grew out of gay lesbian studies in the 1970s and 1980s , has long held among its central tenets the notion that gender is socially constructed. How a man acts, how a woman acts; what clothes and tastes and professions we're supposed to have; even what anatomy men and women are supposed to have - all of these are socially constructed and inscribed in the mind, not the body. Confounding assumptions and conventions about gender helps animate and articulate drag performance, camp rejections of gender binarism (no, Virginia, the world is not divided into masculine and feminine), articulations of queer sexuality, and countless other aspects of LGBTQ existence. None of us is man or woman, except insofar as we participate in cultural discourses of masculinity or femininity. And like other cultural discourses, what is ""manly"" shifts over time and place: there are cultures, today, in which holding hands with other men, wearing skirts, wrestling naked, and even engaging in forms of same-sex activity are all seen as entirely ""manly.""The constructed nature of that which we take as given is also an essential part of the dharma. With regard to gender specifically, Buddhist scholar and feminist Rita Gross has pointed out in the context of feminism, gender constructs and gender identity are aspects of the ego. Queer theory, too, by pointing out the non-essentialistic nature of these egoic conditions, can thus be of tremendous use to dharma practitioners - and even those who practice secular mindfulness - regardless of their sexual or gender identity. Questioning our supposedly innate characteristics--that women are supposedly one way and men another; that women and men are a stable, binary map of all gender identity; that to be a ""man"" involves certain essential traits--is a gesture toward a more robust self-understanding and a more enlightened one. It's all drag, really: the identities, genders, gender roles, gender expressions. Queer theory and the evolving dharma of the West meet at the juncture of non-self.These aspects of queer theory can also call out a potential trap in the creation of LGBT dharma communities. Any ""identity"" can become a kind of self-definition, another fixed aspect of the self that one might consider letting go. Particularities of identity can be useful doors into the dharma - if they function as doors, not cul-de-sacs. To be sure, queer theory can seem rather abstract, and many of its academic proponents prefer it to remain that way. Yet it also captures much about how I experience my gender identity: as not fitting into boxes (including ""gay""), as being defined according to a variety of contingent cultural conditions, and as intersecting with other vectors of oppression far more interesting than the gender of my emotional and physical life-partner. This, I think, is true for many practitioners, regardless of sexual orientation. Even eros, which may seem so essential to our being, is part of the net of selfless causes and conditions, the empty phenomena rolling on, that constitutes our daily lived experience. When we speak, when we move, when we love - really what is acting are these endless causes and conditions, themselves the effects of previous ones. There is, as Sartre said, a great emptiness where we expect to find agency. Conditions are present, things move, anger arises, breezes blow--and there's no one minding the store, no essential identity even in those aspects of mind we consider most foundational. Yet as dedicated practitioners know, this insight ends not in nihilism but in liberation.Let me bring it even further down to earth. I remember sitting in Penn Station in New York one morning while around me thousands of people were enacting and replicating memes installed by culture, religion, education, family. They were dressed in different ways, spoke in different ways, moved in different ways. I'm sure many of them took these styles and senses of self for granted. Many others, perhaps, did not. But what was happening? Cause and effect, non-self--this, as I have experienced it, is the liberation found precisely where some grieve the self's absence. I don't mean to dehumanize us with these metaphors and analogies; on the contrary, I mean to draw us into the same vast matrix of causes and conditions - including social conditions - and in some small way, forgive. That morning in Penn Station, tired and awaiting the train platform to be called, there was little ""given"" at all, and I noticed the arising of compassion and joy."
3,HEALTHY LIVING,Meniscus Repair Helps Prevent Arthritis,"Kevin R. Stone, M.D., ContributorOrthopedic Surgeon and Regenerative Medicine Pioneer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meniscus-repair-_b_5490630.html,"Repairing the arthritic cartilage and replacing the missing meniscus can keep you biologic and help you delay or avoid an artificial knee replacement. In our view, biology trumps bionics any day of the week.",2014-06-17,2014-06-13-meniscusstoneclinicKevinRStoneMDorthopedicsurgeon.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-13-meniscusstoneclinicKevinRStoneMDorthopedicsurgeon-thumb.jpg,"My journey toward becoming an orthopedic surgeon began with a serious knee injury I suffered when playing soccer in college. My meniscus cartilage, the shock absorber in the knee, was badly torn, and the surgeon just took it out and threw it away. While I admired the surgeon who removed it, I was frustrated by the primitive techniques. Surely there had to be a better way? From that time on, I have been thinking about how to repair, regrow or replace this vital piece of cartilage. The meniscus is a fibrous piece of cartilage that sits between the femur (thigh bone) and the tibia (shin bone). There is a medial meniscus, meaning the inside one, and a lateral meniscus, an outside one. The meniscus plays a crucial role in joint stability and lubrication. It is simultaneously soft, smooth and durable, providing a gliding surface between the articular cartilage in the knee that is five times smoother than ice on ice. It is also capable of withstanding tremendous forces, absorbing the shock caused by the motion of up to 3 million steps per year at up to five times a person's body weight.People injure the meniscus in sports and twisting activities, such as planting a foot on a soccer field and then being hit from the side, or they injure it in simple activities, such as getting out of the car, placing the foot on the ground, stepping up and twisting on the knee, and feeling a sudden catch or pop. Once torn, the fibrous shock absorbers produce a rough surface inside the knee, which causes catching, locking, buckling, pain or any combination of the above symptoms inside the knee joint.Most injuries to the meniscus are tears. If the tear is in a clear, clean pattern, it can often be repaired with sutures, sometimes adding growth factors, stem cells and clot materials to augment healing. If it is torn in a complex or degenerative pattern, the damaged tissue is often trimmed away. Advanced repair techniques bring new blood supply into damaged tissue so a larger area of the meniscus can be repaired than previously thought. However, if the meniscus cartilage is significantly damaged, the tissue will need to be removed.Losing a meniscus is tough on the body. Without a meniscus, the covering of each of the bones, called the articular cartilage, rub up against one another, which leads to pain. Eventually, as I can personally testify, it leads to arthritis, the wearing away of the articular cartilage at the ends of the bones.My patients often ask me the very same question I once asked my surgeon: ""Isn't there a shock absorber you can put back into the knee joint to replace the meniscus and to cushion the bones?""Thankfully, unlike the answer I heard all those years ago, today I am happy to answer my patients with ""Yes.""Over the past 20 years, the technique of replacing the meniscus while minimally disrupting other joint tissues has developed into an outpatient arthroscopic procedure: A meniscus allograft, a donor meniscus cartilage matched to a patient's height and weight, is used. The allograft meniscus is accurately placed into the knee and carefully secured with sutures. The patients then follow a specific rehabilitation protocol to get them back to full fitness.Traditionally, it was thought that you could not replace the meniscus if the knee had already become arthritic. Our data show this is not true. When the opposing surfaces are arthritic, they can be treated with a paste-grafting procedure to restore the articular cartilage. Over the past 20 years, our studies of the survival of meniscus cartilage in arthritic joints have seen superb results, with 80 percent of patients reporting reduced pain and improved function over the long term. [1]Living with a damaged or missing meniscus is a recipe for arthritis. Fixing tears early or replacing the meniscus may help you avoid this fate. Repairing the arthritic cartilage and replacing the missing meniscus can keep you biologic and help you delay or avoid an artificial knee replacement. In our view, biology trumps bionics any day of the week.First published in The San Francisco ExaminerReference: 1. Stone KR, Adelson WS, Pelsis JR, et al. 2010.

4,QUEER VOICES,Spencer Shows Big Pride in a Small Town Indiana Setting,"Samuel Autman, ContributorWriter; Faculty, DePauw University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spencer-shows-big-pride-i_b_5492207.html,"All across the nation, tens of thousands will gather some time in June for annual gay pride parades and festivities.

TV cameras easily capture dancing go-go boys and prancing gender illusionists.In a news media culture that covers the quick and easy, the most interesting events are often overlooked. This is especially true of local news organizations in Indiana. I've been to pride celebrations in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City but the most eye-popping pride I've attended in recent years took place on June 7 in Spencer, Ind., a rural town of 2,200 residents -- 55 miles southwest of Indianapolis. Every time I mention it, colleagues looked at me and said, ""What? There's a pride celebration in Spencer.""""Yes,"" I always answer. Anticipating that no news organizations from either Indianapolis or Terre Haute would cover it, I, a former reporter, grabbed my old reporter's notebook and a digital camera, and drove 30 miles south of where I live.Here's what I found: For at least one day a year, the residents of this central Indiana town are accustomed to seeing men in wigs and stilettos lip-syncing on the Owen County Courthouse square. It's quite something to behold.""It's the only place in the state where a drag show happens on the courthouse square,"" says Jonathan Balash, president of Spencer Pride, Inc.    Gender illusionist Gina Delicious performs.Spencer Pride began in 2007 as a word-of-mouth gathering of a few hundred people at Cooper's Park along the White River. Over the years it snowballed into an event that attracts about 1,000 people annually. Balash says in 2012 attendance peaked with 1,200. Not bad considering there are only 1,008 households in Spencer. It would be easy to assume that the lion's share of the crowd comes from the nearby Bloomington, 17 miles to the east. Considered a gay-friendly mecca and home of Indiana University with more than 40,0000 students attending, but it's not so. By the time Spencer Pride rolls around school is out. Most of the pride-goers sojourn from all over the Hoosier State, and from as far away as Chicago, Louisville and Columbus, Ohio to participate.""We tend to resonate with people who grew up in small towns like this,"" he says, pointing to the town known for its quietness and tree-lined streets.This year's theme ""Focus on Families,"" seemed to be apt. There was a petting station with roosters, two lambs and a goat, a play area for children and a mobile library. There were married couples, senior citizens walking around and high school kids sitting on the town square playing cards. Seventy-five vendors sprawled on all four sides of the Owen County Courthouse, the largest number yet. In addition to the rainbow accessories, food and other expected vendors known to visit pride events, Balash was proud to have Wal-Mart represented at a booth, another first.    Three Spencer Pride attendees speak with a vendor on the square. A wide array of singers and musicians, from country to folk to rap and a regional favorite, the Quarryland Men's Chorus, took the stage. The music was loud and festive. Organizers placed the drag show at the end of the day so latecomers could attend.No single person can lay claim to establishing Spencer's pride. Organizers say a handful of people saw a need and believed the community would be open. They were surprised just how open.Felix McBeath remembers participating in one of the first conversations. He and a few friends talked about it in a lesbian bar in Ellettsville, nine miles east of town.""One of my main concerns was that we reach out in the rural community,"" he says, flashing a big smile. ""Just because we are all different doesn't mean we can't all get along in the same community.""Over the years, McBeath, who moved to rural Indiana in 1976 from Mississippi, has forged his own sense of identity and community. He moved to Bloomington for a brief time but then returned. He prefers the peace and quiet to which he had grown accustomed. Now 52, the openly gay Wal-Mart says if they can hold a pride festival in rural Indiana, it can happen anywhere in America.Balash and McBeath believe the key to the success of their event is community-based leadership and getting the buy-in of local government.Over the years it has been pretty peaceful. They've heard murmurings. One year someone scattered tiny nails all over the streets around the courthouse the night before so pride-goers might get flat tires. But Owen County Sheriff deputies got on their hands and knees and removed them all. ""No one's car was damaged,"" Balash proudly reports.Back when he and a handful of people started Spencer Pride, they weren't trying to be trendsetters or create the smallest pride event in the Hoosier State.""We really didn't think about it in that context,"" Balash says. ""We were just trying to be who we are.""For more information about Spencer Pride go to https://sites.google.com/site/ruralpride/To hear organizers share in the YouTube It Gets Better campaign. http://bit.ly/1n6RkBI"

Perfect conditions however, to practise mindfulness for anyone heading into the city to attend Google's mindful leadership conference, Search Inside Yourself.Sponsored by the Wakeup Project, 350 Sydney-siders filled the ballroom at the Sheraton on the Park to hear what the latest buzz coming out of California was all about. Tech giants like Google, Twitter, Intel and Facebook have embraced mindful meditation and are setting a standard for corporations around the world, building better support frameworks for the health and wellbeing of their staff. Jono Fisher, founder of The Wake Up Project and curator of the Mindful Leadership Global Forum shares his view on this trend, ""The truly innovative companies believe one thing - focusing on people drives performance and the bottom line. When employees feel cared for, when their inner lives are respected, they naturally become more innovative and productive. I have a vision and passion to celebrate Mindful Leadership and Living, and for Australian leaders to not only get involved in the mindful revolution, but to lead it!""Only recently made available to the public outside of Google's campuses, Search Inside Yourself was developed within Google by an engineer, Chade-Meng Tan who started work on 'creating the conditions for world peace' as his 20 percent personal project.John Kabat-Zinn, creator of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, and one of the original consultants to Meng on the project defines mindfulness as ""Paying attention in a particular way; on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally.""Mindfulness meditation has been shown in studies to have significant effects on reducing stress, anxiety and depression. Simply sitting quietly for 5 minutes a day is bringing stressed out tech entrepreneurs and Wall Street investors much needed respite from information overload, career pressure and environmental distress.So what did Google have to say to the Aussies?  During the two day intensive, Search Inside Yourself teachers, Mark Coleman and the gracious and lively Linda Curtis, unpacked these cornerstones of developing an effective mindful practice:1. Self Awareness How to increase awareness through practicing regular mindfulness techniques.2. Self Regulation A key outcome of the self awareness practices is the ability to effectively manage emotions and reactions when facing an emotional trigger.3. Motivation Uncovering personal values and ensuring we live in alignment with those to help cultivate a harmonious life.4. Empathy Learning to transform thinking from beyond concerns of self-oriented satisfaction into kindness and understanding of others and their experiences.5. Social Skills Communication methods to bring mindfulness into a supportive and effective context, rather than being reactive and fear based.We practiced a range of mindfulness techniques from breathing meditation, journaling, mindful walking, cultivating empathy and mindful listening.The highlight for me was the session on Mindful Leadership, as a seasoned meditator many of the insights were not new to me, but I was inspired by the positive applications of using mindfulness effectively in leadership, through self-assessment, finding purpose, developing others, having difficult conversations mindfully, as well as giving feedback.Linda Curtis shares her attraction to this program, ""What appeals to me about this work is that it is not work. It's inspiring, pragmatic, simple without being simplistic. Search Inside Yourself combines the wisdom of the ancient sages with proven science and provides an accessible program that explores profound truths without diminishing them. I've watched the integration of these tools become a powerful game-changer for the individual and their communities inside and outside the office. Well-being and happiness increases, relationships improve, better decisions are made, leader's discover sustainable ways of being out in front. The implications for peace are exciting to ponder.""The takeaway for me was, 'mindfulness is an idea whose time has come.' As humans we are peaceful and happy by nature, and mindfulness tools are proven techniques for us to learn to manage stress and bring more kindness and purpose into our lives, workplaces and the world around us.On a related topic check out my recent article on aligning your life's purpose with your work."
6,POLITICS,Members Of Congress Demand Increased Access To Marijuana For Research Purposes,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-marijuana-research_n_5481172.html,,2014-06-17,"ASPEN, CO - APRIL 18: A woman looks over stem-full of marijuana buds with a special illuminated magnifier at the Cannabis Crown 2010 expo in Aspen, Colorado. Cannabis Crown 2010 is hosting hundreds of marijuana-industry vendors and thousands of marijuana users in two hotels in Aspen, as well as holding a hemp fashion show and a marijuana-quality judging. Colorado, one of 14 states to allow use of medical marijuana, has experienced an explosion in marijuana dispensaries, trade shows and related businesses in the last year as marijuana use becomes more mainstream here.

Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Tuesday demanding an end to the federal monopoly on marijuana research so that more studies can be done by scientists around the nation.""We write to express our support for increasing scientific research on the therapeutic risks and benefits of marijuana,"" the letter reads. ""We ask that you take measures to ensure that any non-National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded researcher who has acquired necessary Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Institutional Review Board (IRB), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and appropriate state and local authority approval be able to access marijuana for research at-cost without further review."" (Read the full text of the letter below.)The letter comes about two weeks after the House voted to block the Drug Enforcement Administration from using funds to go after medical marijuana operations that are legal under state laws, a measure that Rohrabacher sponsored.And just last week, a scathing joint report from the Drug Policy Alliance and and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies blasted the DEA, arguing that the agency has repeatedly failed to act in a timely fashion when faced with petitions to reschedule marijuana.The drug is currently illegal under federal law, and remains classified as a Schedule I substance, a designation the DEA reserves for the ""most dangerous"" drugs with ""no currently accepted medical use."" Schedule I drugs, which include substances like heroin and LSD, cannot receive federal funding for research. On three separate occasions -- in 1973, 1995 and 2002 -- the DEA took years to make a final decision about a rescheduling petition, and in two of those cases the DEA was sued multiple times to force a decision.Last week's report criticized the DEA for overruling its own officials charged with determining how illicit substances should be scheduled. It also accused the agency of creating a ""regulatory Catch-22"" by arguing there is not enough scientific evidence to support rescheduling marijuana -- while simultaneously impeding the research that would produce such evidence.""Two weeks ago, we took a very important vote in the House to stop the DEA from interfering in states' medical marijuana programs,"" Blumenauer said in a statement Tuesday. ""Now we need the Administration to stop targeting marijuana above and beyond other drugs when it comes to research. By increasing access for scientists who are conducting studies, we end the Catch-22 of opponents claiming they can't support medical marijuana because there's not enough research, but blocking research because they don't support medical marijuana.""The U.S. government grows marijuana for research purposes at the University of Mississippi in the only federally legal marijuana garden in the U.S. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) oversees the cultivation, production and distribution of these crops -- a process through which the only federally-sanctioned marijuana studies are approved. Federal authorities have long been accused of only funding marijuana research that focuses on the potential negative effects of the drug. Since 2003, more than 500 grants for marijuana-related studies have received federal approval, with a marked upswing in recent years, according to McClatchy. Only 22 grants were approved in 2003 for cannabis research, totaling $6 million, but in 2012, 69 grants were approved for a total of over $30 million.Despite these numbers, NIDA has reportedly conducted only about 30 studies to date on the potential benefits of marijuana, according to The Hill.Currently, 22 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use. Eight other states -- Alabama, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin -- have legalized CBD oil, a non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that is frequently used to treat epilepsy, for limited medical use or for research purposes.A number of studies in recent years have shown the medical potential of cannabis. Purified forms may attack some forms of aggressive cancer. Marijuana use has also been tied to better blood sugar control and may help slow the spread of HIV. One study found that legalization of the plant for medical purposes may even lead to lower suicide rates.Read the full letter below:Dear Secretary Burwell,  We write to express our support for increasing scientific research on the therapeutic risks and benefits of marijuana. We ask that you take measures to ensure that any non-National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded researcher who has acquired necessary Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Institutional Review Board (IRB), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and appropriate state and local authority approval be able to access marijuana for research at-cost without further review.  Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing for the use of medical marijuana. Over one million Americans currently use medical marijuana at the recommendation of their physician. There is overwhelming anecdotal evidence from patients, their family members, and their doctors of the therapeutic benefits of marijuana for those suffering from cancer, epilepsy, seizures, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, glaucoma, anxiety, chronic pain, and more.  We believe the widespread use of medical marijuana should necessitate research into what specific relief it offers and how it can best be delivered for different people and different conditions. Yet, the scientific research clearly documenting these benefits has often been hampered by federal barriers.  Researchers seeking to develop prescription drugs in the United States must go through FDA and IRB approval processes. To conduct research using Schedule I substances such as marijuana, LSD, psilocybin and MDMA, researchers must also seek a DEA registration, as well as any required state and local licenses. The review process required to gain these approvals is robust and ensures that researchers are weighing the risks as well as the possible benefits of their potential medications.  Only with marijuana, and no other Schedule I substances, is there an additional Public Health Service review for non NIH-funded protocols, established in the May 21, 1999, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ""Guidance on Procedures for the Provision of Marijuana for Medical Research[1]."" This review process grants access to the only source of marijuana that can be legally used for research - grown by the University of Mississippi under contract with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  In light of the fact that substances like opioids and barbiturates have been researched and developed for human use, it would seem that we should investigate the legitimate medical uses of marijuana. We request that you review and revise the HHS Guidance to eliminate what we believe to be an unnecessary additional review process. NIDA should provide marijuana at-cost to all non-NIH funded marijuana research protocols that have successfully obtained necessary FDA, DEA, IRB and appropriate state and local authority approval.  Considering the number of states with medical marijuana laws and the number of patients who use marijuana medicinally in the United States, it is clear that we need more scientific information about the therapeutic risks and benefits of marijuana.  Thank you for your attention to this request, and we look forward to your response."

(Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae4f412200004301dae99f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday, May 11, St. John's College in Annapolis held its two hundred twenty-second commencement ceremony. The commencement speaker was Andrew J. Krivak, an alumnus of the Annapolis Class of 1986, and a 2011 National Book Award Finalist for his first novel, The Sojourn.   One expects to hear a great deal of laudatory rhetoric at a commencement ceremony. Commencement speakers have something of an obligation to congratulate the graduates, as well as to praise parents and relatives for their support. They often make these celebratory topics the centerpieces of their speeches.   Mr. Krivak certainly fulfilled the obligation very elegantly. But he chose to place at the center of his speech an unexpected theme: the suffering and joy of struggle.   It takes a novelist to remind us of something that is difficult for us to see from our perspective at the center of our own experience, namely, that our lives follow the curve of a narrative. ""We are not just subjects,"" he told us. ""We are stories. Each of us will trace an arc of beginning, middle, and end, and each of us will struggle, just as it is in the beginning of the Iliad--mēnin aeide thea--right through to the end, when they will bury us breakers of horses. And only in that is there any truth."" In many ways, the students across the nation who are graduating from college at this time of year are just marking an inflection point in the stories of their lives. And if their educations have been sound, they are well aware that commencement means the beginning of struggle--and they are excited about facing it. A strong liberal education, especially, inspires students to value struggle. By grappling with authors and ideas that demand the highest degree of intellectual intensity--and this is especially true in subjects that are difficult and uncongenial--students learn that they stretch themselves more through struggle, whether they win or lose the match.Even forty-four years after my own college graduation, I still remember wrestling with, and often losing to, Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, and Hegel. And I now know something I could not have known as a college student, namely, that the struggles I faced with each of those authors had more to do with me than with them. And now, with the benefit of hindsight, I can see how those college-age struggles prepared me to meet the struggles that lay, unexpectedly, ahead of me in the years that followed: the struggles of law school, of family life, of running my own law firm, of being a college president, of caring for my aging parents.Many college students are required to prepare themselves for life in this way by completing a significant inquiry into a question of their own choosing with which they must struggle mightily. At St. John's, students must write and be examined on a substantial essay each year, culminating in their Senior Essay, on which they are publicly examined by three faculty members. Here are some of the titles of this year's Senior Essays, which indicate the sorts of inquiries our students completed:The Poet as Hero in ""The Waste Land""   Together They Go Astray: The Family of Anna Karenina and Alexei Vronsky in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina   The Security of Liberty: An Examination of American Identity in the American Founding Documents   Finding Home: Man's Journey in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony   Nature's ""One Long Argument"": On the Role of Man's Ignorance in Charles Darwin's Origin   Achilles and the Devastation of Learning   Revenge and the Permanence of Tragedy in The Virgin Spring   Intuition and Intellection: A Theory of Parallels   Jesus and Jurisprudence: Love as the Fulfillment of the Law of Moses   Harmonizing Souls: An Examination of The Souls of Black Folks   S/He Had It Coming: A Murder but Not a Crime? Seeing Justice Done in Aeschylus's Oresteia ""If we are stories,"" Mr. Krivak told us, ""then we will struggle. The Greeks called it the agōn. The contest."" The nation's colleges and universities intend to make our students enter the contest. Every good teacher know that life is full of struggle, and if we want our students to make the most of life, to enjoy it to the fullest, then they must learn how to enjoy struggle. Educators and parents must resist the all-too-human temptation to make life too comfortable for young people, who learn more about life by having to solve their own problems than by having problems solved for them.The commencement ceremonies of May and June provide a moment's respite between the struggles of the past and the struggles yet to come. Let us wish our graduating students all the best on their future struggles, and on the riches they will realize -- both from the contests they lose and from those they win."
