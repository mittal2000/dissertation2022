The WHO says as many as 2 million people may be suffering from drug-resistant strains by 2015.Treating even typical TB is a long process. Patients need to take a cocktail of antibiotics for six months and many fail to complete the treatment. That, alongside overuse and misuse of antibiotics, has fuelled growing drug resistance.Multi-drug resistant TB withstands two standard drugs. And an even more severe form known as extensively drug-resistant TB - which can evade even the most highly effective drugs - was reported in at least 77 countries in 2011, according to the WHO.Doctors in India have also reported cases of totally resistant TB, for which there are no effective drugs.The WHO and the Global Fund said they had found an anticipated gap of $1.6 billion in annual international support for the fight against TB in 118 low and middle income countries.If this gap were filled, it could mean 17 million patients with TB and multi drug-resistant TB could be fully treated, saving about 6 million lives between 2014 and 2016, they said.""It is critical that we raise the funding that is urgently needed to control this disease,"" Mark Dybul, executive director of the Global Fund, said in the statement. ""If we don't act now, our costs could skyrocket. It is invest now or pay forever.""The agencies said most of the extra money was needed to seep up the accurate diagnosis of TB, and the process of establishing which drugs it may resist. Cash was also needed to improve access to effective medicines.On top of the $1.6 billion funding gap, the WHO and its partner health agencies said another $1.3 billion a year was needed to boost research on TB and encourage the development of new drugs, diagnostic tests and vaccines.The current vaccine known as Bacilli Calmette-Guerin, or BCG, is given routinely to babies in countries with high rates of TB to prevent severe disease.But its protection wears off in a few years and it does not protect against the most common form of TB that invades the lungs of adults and adolescents.Eagerly-awaited results last month from trials of the first new TB vaccine for 90 years were disappointing, showing it offered no added benefit over BCG.Drug companies and research groups are working on other potential new vaccines but scientific progress is proving tricky and slow.

The daytime talk show ""The Doctors"" said that Harper will appear on the show Monday to talk about her brain cancer. The 1970s sitcom star has been diagnosed with a rare brain cancer and told she has as little as three months to live. Harper played Rhoda Morgenstern on television's ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and its spinoff, ""Rhoda."" (AP Photo/Charles Sykes, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf1291f00005100216bf5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I accidently stumbled upon Rhoda during my senior year of college. Wide awake at 2 a.m. one night (thoughts about life post-college often kept me up back then), I turned on the TV and started flipping through the channels until I landed on this vibrant, colorful sitcom I'd never seen before, but it somehow felt intimately familiar. About 15 minutes in, I found myself utterly delighted by Rhoda, Joe, Brenda, and Ida. The following night, I deliberately stayed up to catch another two episodes and maintained this pattern until I had seen all 106 episodes, courtesy of Nick at Nite. Rather than pandering to the lowest common denominator or relishing in mean-spirited cynicism, Rhoda's humor reveals a profound appreciation and love for humanity, our foibles, fears, vulnerabilities, and strengths. It's smart, honest, and real. And it resonated with me deeply. At the show's helm, Valerie Harper created a character who's funny, authentic, courageous, and remarkably endearing. I rooted for Rhoda to marry Joe. The episode when she goes to night school and cheats on a test struck me as especially hilarious. The dynamic between Rhoda and her strong-willed but well-intentioned mother... well, I could relate. Watching the last episode of Rhoda felt like reading the final chapter of a beloved book -- I knew the end was near, but I wasn't happy about it at all. While visiting my sister the summer after I graduated college, I read in the local paper that Valerie was performing her one-woman show at a nearby theater. Of course, I had to go. At that point in my life, I was on the verge of law school, which seemed like a very reasonable and most appropriate next step. I happened to feel passionately about acting, but committing myself to the life of an actor didn't seem nearly as reasonable or appropriate. I rationalized my decision by thinking that I could become an entertainment lawyer, establish myself financially, and then, 10 or so years down the road, give acting a go. As I watched Valerie transform into multiple characters at the drop of a hat, use all of herself to communicate an extraordinary story, and elevate the stage with her expansive presence, something inside of me clicked. Just like that, in a heartbeat, I knew with undeniable certainty what I intended to do with my life. All the confusion, struggle, and muddiness dissolved in a delicious instant. In the past, my tendency had been to seek external guidance when making pivotal decisions. I wouldn't dare trust the capacity of my own internal compass to know what's best for me. But watching Valerie at work must have activated my inner resolve because, for the first time, I felt absolutely no need to reach outside myself for answers. I was too full of my own inner knowing to worry about what anyone else had to say. I had never experienced such a crystallized moment of clarity before, and I was truly grateful. When I learned that Valerie had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, I felt that same mix of shock and sadness that so many others felt upon hearing the news. I also felt compelled to acknowledge the impact she's had on my life and express my gratitude for her incredible work, comedic brilliance, and willingness to share her gifts with the world. She prompted me to access courage within myself that I didn't even know I had. If Valerie could make the leap into acting, then so could I. Watching her interviews this past week, I continue to be inspired by Valerie as she acknowledged her fears and readiness for whatever lies ahead while still remaining firmly optimistic and open to a miracle. Her generosity of spirit and strength of character is truly astounding. She has learned and encourages us to accept the inevitability of death -- we're all terminal -- but don't dwell on it. Dwell instead on the intention to savor each moment fully... well, those are some wise words to live by. So, while I think I've exhausted my allotment of adjectives in this blog, I'd like to simply say: Thank you, Valerie Harper.

You'll see this dynamic duo iterated in a number of ways, from color blocks chockfull of contrast, to perky polka dots, serious stripes and bold graphic elements. And since interiors always follow fashion, I predict we'll start to see black and white infiltrating homes and commercial spaces in upcoming seasons.While I've always been a fan of black and white lacquer and bold, blocky Chinese Chippendale patterns (seen frequently in designs by Kelly Wearstler), I think this up-and-coming color combo will extend far beyond traditional associations. Black and white will surpass French provincial to produce a more modern urban look. Here are some interior design elements to look out for. In upholstery, pillows, draperies, and other fabrics, forget the typical toile and look for bold, black-and-white stripes, ""no-print"" prints and ethnic ikat designs. Polka dots (notoriously fun and reminiscent of the '80s) may make a comeback in bedding and wallcoverings giving rooms a playful lift, but look for dots that are slightly less symmetrical and regimented (think delicate paintbrush dabs, rather than unforgiving orbs). As for wall art, sophisticated charcoal sketches and old-school typography are the way to go.To keep black and white rooms from becoming stark, warm them up with medium-toned natural wood and metallic details, such as nailheads and antiqued finishes. For a more modern look, go for graphic, geometric shapes, abstract designs and color blocking, then add a splash of orange for a pop of contemporary color. Whether simple or ornate, black and white décor is all about a clean, sophisticated sense of style, so clear out the color and enjoy the view!"

It drives me crazy that I won't be there to celebrate you like last year. Thank god for childhood amnesia and Facetime, I suppose. Point is, you're growing up fast. Like Usain Bolt fast. Soon you'll want to speed things up even more. Press fast forward. ""Grow up."" When you're 10, the high school kids will seem mature and independent. They're not. They might drive cars and they likely won't have a bedtime, but they're just like you, trying to figure out where they fit in.When you're in high school, 20-somethings will seem exciting. Some wear suits. They have jobs. Some might even have a career. If TV is the truth, they have sex with every meal. They have the freedom to do whatever they damn well please, even if that means watching four hours of television in elastic pants while eating hummus with their index finger. But their eyes are just as eager to see what comes next. They escape from the present and turn their attention to the future tense: ""when I finish school,"" ""when I find a job I love,"" ""when I get married,"" as if any of that is promised.Well, at some point, the teeter-totter will tip in the other direction. You'll try to grab hold of time and slow it down. You'll want more time to discover your true passion, turn your career into a calling, find true love and friends that challenge you to be a better you. As these slip in and out of your fingers, you'll wonder if time is passing you by, if maybe these things are for other people, not you. Like Missy, you'll want to take time, flip it and reverse it. You'll get hung up on regret, thinking about the might-have-loved and the should-have-been. Take my story, for example. Doing well in school always mattered to me. When grandma Mia told me that I could be whatever I wanted if I tried my best in school, I believed her. The more time I invested in school, the more doing well in school came to define me. Like an anchor, sometimes keeping me grounded, other times dragging me down. Here's the thing, Sam: This too was an escape from the present, from figuring out what really mattered to me, and acting on it. While I don't regret this -- I ultimately got into the graduate school I wanted and was lucky enough to find a job that gives me purpose -- doing well in school should have been justified on its own terms, in the moment. It should be about getting lost in another world and understanding your own as the pages turn. And yet I focused so intently on doing well in school that everything else -- everything that it turns out really matters in life like honest-to-god friends, figuring out what makes you tick and love defined by partnership -- got pushed to the side. It's not that I didn't think these were important too, Sam. I did. It's that for too long I thought they would follow automatically, as if they were somehow guaranteed, a promised part of life. They're not. I've learned the hard way that you have to work harder at these than anything. But ""when I""s ran rampant in my mind because I didn't want to admit to myself that maybe, possibly, I would grow old, alone, with a fancy degree, framed like it matters. Until one morning, sometime a year and a half ago, I woke up and realized that ""when I"" is a crutch, that nothing is promised and everything that matters must be lived intentionally and authentically, that tomorrow is a fiction, and today -- right now, right this instant -- is what matters. The propensity to get lost in what should have been or what might be one day is an escape from what is. Yours is an even greater challenge, hate to say it. Being present, being mindful, being intentional about what matters to you is a daunting task even without technology grabbing your attention like it is entitled. It's bad now -- moments of reflection zapped by status updates and Tweets. In writing the last paragraph I checked my email twice and Facebook once. I can only imagine what you will face when these questions cross your mind. Whatever the case, it is a fight worth fighting because you can only ensure the future you want for yourself by confronting the present with courage. So put down your cell phone. Seriously, put it down. Stop texting for just one second. Your phone, I promise, awaits your return with open, eager arms. Now, take a deep breath. C'mon, play along. A really deep breath. Feel it in your gut. In. Out. Repeat. Feel the carpet rub against the heel of your foot, the fibers twisting in between your toes. Hear the bass as it thumps along. Notice your head as it bobs to the beat without so much as a conscious thought. See the bright lights of the computer screen and feel the clicks and the clacks of the keyboard as you punch the plastic keys.For more by Charley Johnson, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."

He said he would weigh the evidence and announce his verdict in court at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday.Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, two members of the Steubenville High School football team, are charged as juveniles with raping a girl by digital penetration during the early-morning hours of Aug. 12, 2012, while she was passed out from heavy drinking at a party.If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to a juvenile detention facility until they turn 21, and be required to register as sex offenders.Mays and Richmond have denied raping their accuser and say that any sexual contact that occurred was consensual.The case drew national attention to the Ohio steel town of Steubenville, 40 miles (64 km) west of Pittsburgh, after photo and video images, as well as Twitter banter, were posted online appearing to document the alleged assault and its aftermath.In her testimony on Saturday, the accuser recounted drinking vodka mixed with slushy-iced beverages the night of the party, then finding herself sitting on a curb early the next day with her hands between her legs, vomiting into the street.She testified that she otherwise had no recollection of what happened during the time span in between, when witnesses in the case have said she was too drunk to move or talk.Under its policy of keeping the names of accusers in rape cases confidential, Reuters has not identified the girl.Prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter argued that the very things that made the accuser ""an imperfect witness (also) made her, in every sense of the word, a perfect victim.""""She was substantially impaired, and they treated her like a toy,"" the prosecutor said.Defense attorney Walter Madison countered by highlighting inconsistencies in the accounts of various witnesses, one of whom he accused of taking part in assaulting the girl, then cooperating with prosecutors under a grant of immunity.

Kimani Gray, 16, was shot by two police officers late on Saturday in Brooklyn's East Flatbush neighborhood after police said he pointed a handgun at them. Gray's family has denied the teen was armed. An autopsy revealed that Gray had been shot seven times, including three times in the back. Although the report did not detail the order in which the bullets struck Gray, the revelations increased tensions among the already furious community. AFP PHOTO/DON EMMERT (Photo credit should read DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baddae82000009900ff220e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dressed in a puffy black down jacket, gray hoody and indigo-colored jeans belted to expose a four-inch expanse of his plaid boxers, Malik Priestly stood outside the Tilden Educational Campus in the East Flatbush section of Central Brooklyn Saturday afternoon and paced. Priestly stopped and stared at the door. His sister had already gone inside. Even though it was snowing, he frittered with his iPhone, then put it away and took to rubbing his almost coal-colored hands in front of his mouth for heat. Priestly, 16, was trying to decide whether to go inside and do what he called “the good-kid” thing -- talk about the shooting death of another black 16-year-old, Kimani Gray, at the hands of two plain clothes New York City police officers this month. Then listen to impromptu sermons thinly disguised as questions about “youth” and the three nights of protest following the shooting that ended in clashes with police. Or, Priestly could go home, watch cartoons and brood. “My sister wanted to come up here,” said Priestly, who did not know Gray personally but often saw Gray around the neighborhood and even shared some of the same friends. “But I’m kind of like wondering, what good is any of it going to do? I might get stopped, frisked, maybe shot next week.”Young men like Priestly and, before his sudden death, Gray, often live in communities where police and many residents say crime and gangs warrant intense police patrols, scrutiny and the use of confrontational police techniques such as the New York Police Department’s Stop and Frisk program (officially known as Stop, Question and Frisk). Stop and Frisk aims to identify people with illegal guns and those engaged in other criminal activity and take them off the street with a program of surprise contact with those who look suspicious. This contact can involve pat downs, and, when warranted, arrests, according to police. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has repeatedly described the program as a key crime prevention and reduction tool, and said that the program will, at minimum, remain in place through the remainder of his term, which ends at the end of this year. Gray was stopped as a part of the Stop and Frisk program, his family says.Public opinion polls have repeatedly demonstrated a sharp racial divide in the way that the program is viewed. An August 2012 New York Times poll found that 55 percent of whites surveyed about the program describe it as perfectly acceptable while 56 percent of blacks and 44 percent of Latinos described it as excessive. East Flatbush is a community that in some ways exemplifies the kind of neighborhood that is most often heavily policed. In the mostly black neighborhood, unemployment and poverty sit above average. No publicly-financed community centers sit within a 3 mile radius, and many schools in the area rank among the city’s struggling institutions. Gangs, or loosely organized crews, have a real foothold in the area, as do some of their criminal enterprises. In the last two years alone, Gilford Monrose, pastor of Brooklyn’s Mt Zion Church of God 7th Day and president of the 67th police precinct clergy council, has overseen funeral services for 10 people under the age of 25.It is also a community where most of its residents are first, second and third generation Caribbean immigrants, and long-time residents say it is the sort of place they don’t plan to leave.“In East Flatbush, of course, we recognize that we have a gun problem a gang problem,"" Monrose said. ""But we also have honest, hard working citizens who want to be policed in a different way. The perception is they are being targeted unfairly.”Gray was shot and killed March 9 in an incident that has been described in different ways by police and witnesses. Major facts related to the shooting -- whether Gray was carrying a gun at the time of his death or attempting to use it when shot -- remain unclear. The NYPD did not respond to a Huffington Post request for information, but told The New York Times that plain clothes police approached Gray and a group of ""men"" around 11:30 p.m., identified themselves as police and ordered them to stop. Mr. Gray turned and pointed a .38-caliber Rohm revolver at them, the police said; two officers fired, hitting the teenager. He was pronounced dead a short time later at Kings County Hospital Center.The group of “men,” was actually a collection of mostly teenaged boys including Gray and his twin best friends, said Kenneth Montgomery, a lawyer representing Gray’s family and a one-time New York City prosecutor who worked closely with police on gang crimes. The group was headed to a Sweet 16 party. Not far from the twins’ home, police spotted the group, circled the block and then jumped out of their vehicle issuing orders to stop amid a barrage of curse words. Frightened, Gray attempted to flee but also needed to adjust his sagging pants. As he fiddled with his pants or belt, police officers shot the boy, Montgomery said. Witnesses told Montgomery that Gray was not armed.At a press conference last week, Kimani Gray’s mother Carol described her son as a victim of a police slaughter, but nobody’s perfect angel since the sudden death of his brother in a car accident two years ago. He had a short record consisting of a joy riding charge, Montgomery said. But Kimani Gray was not in a gang, and to her knowledge, did not own or have access to a gun, Carol Gray said. “I want to know why,” she said of her son’s death. Kimani, a boy know to his family as Kiki, was the son of a Jamaican immigrant mother and a Guyanese migrant father. ""I don't condone any riots, any looting, any shooting, anything against any police officers ... I only want justice for two police officers to be off the street before they hurt another young kid.”The NYPD has initiated an internal affairs investigation, which is standard procedure after a shooting. Montgomery and Gray’s family plan to meet with the District Attorney’s office this week. Court records do indicate that the two officers involved in the shooting have been accused of using excessive or inappropriate levels of force and violating the rights of people with whom they have come in contact on at least five occasions, leading to more than $100,000 in settlement payouts.On Thursday, the New York Civil Liberties Union announced that the city’s police department is  well on its way to initiating 5 million stop and frisks. Of the 4.4 million stops that have already been recorded, just over 86 percent of those stopped and frisked were black or Latino and 88 percent of these interactions did not lead to an arrest or citation requiring a court appearance. “These paramilitary police tactics, the over policing of communities that in city after city just happen to be black ad brown,” Montgomery said. “They distort the experience of growing up, walking down the street and even the most basic interactions with the police. And it's not just Brooklyn. That's what's happening in almost every city in this country.” Back outside the Tilden building Saturday, Priestly decided to send his sister a text message. It read, “Can't handle it. Going home.”  "

March Madness -- or that time of the year when people fill out brackets and watch basketball games at the office -- is here. An estimated 3 million American workers will spend one to three hours a day during work watching the 2013 NCAA men’s basketball championship tournament, according to a study from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. While 14 percent of employees surveyed said they would spend three to four hours per day watching the tournament, 16 percent said they would spend five hours or more. As workers everywhere glue themselves to their office television screens, Americans companies stand to lose at least $134 million in “lost wages” just in the first two days of the tournament alone. “It is surprising when you see just how big the numbers are and how big the impact can be,” Chief Executive Officer John A. Challenger told The Huffington Post. “We know that because games take place during the work day and with the Internet so widespread now, its easy for workers to get distracted."" Some employees do more than just secretly watch the games in the office. Seven percent of survey respondents said that they would take time off to watch the tournament and 12 percent admitted they had called in sick in the past to ensure they didn't miss their favorite game. Despite the apparent prevalence of tournament watching, Challenger said employers are making a good, albeit expensive, long-term investment by allowing their employees to watch the games. By giving workers the freedom to go online during the workday and do something other than work, employers have the potential to increase their employees' happiness, which could lead to higher worker output. ""It takes managers taking a step back and recognizing that today really we measure people's output in the amount of work people do and the quality of work they do rather than the time they spend actually doing the work itself,"" he said. Of course March Madness isn't the only thing distracting employees. In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that workers get interrupted and distracted every three minutes while on the job. Even the man with one of the most important jobs in the country devotes a considerable amount of attention to March Madness: President Barack Obama . House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) recently made a dig at the President, suggesting he spends more time ""filling out his March Madness brackets"" than ""writing a budget."""

But records reviewed by Reuters show those rights were obtained for free in 2009.The FBI is involved because the payment originated from a Universal subsidiary based in Nevada. Both the FBI and the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) have been looking into a total of $40 million in transfers to Soriano as a possible bribery case since last year.In a closed-door, three-day hearing with the Nevada Gaming Control Board that concluded on Friday, Universal directors, including the company's billionaire founder Kazuo Okada, were questioned about the payment, a source familiar with those proceedings said.In a statement issued to Reuters as that hearing ended, Universal said it now believed the $25 million payment to Soriano should not have been made.Universal said its board had not been aware that the land rights problem had been resolved without any money changing hands between Universal and the owner of those rights in late 2009.It blamed three former employees for the mistaken payment and said one of them had withheld information from the board that could have prevented the transfer.Universal sued the three Japanese men last year, claiming they were to blame for $15 million in payments to Soriano without proper authorization. It offered no evidence to support its additionoal claim they were also responsible for the $25 million it has now disavowed and said its investigation into the matter was still ongoing.The three former employees declined to comment. They have challenged the company's previous claims in filings to the Tokyo District Court.Soriano could not be reached for comment and his whereabouts are unknown. Universal generates the bulk of its profits from pachinko machines - a cross between slots and pinball -- in Japan. The Philippines marks its first independent foray into casino operations and is a key plank of its push to expand overseas.It has said it conducted its business in the Philippines lawfully, and in December announced a defamation suit against Reuters for its reporting on the payments to Soriano.Universal said it was still investigating how the $25 million payment to Soriano was used.""We have no information at this time that this money was used to pay any government officials,"" the company said in a written statement to Reuters. NO-COST DEALWhen Universal paid $300 million for reclaimed land for its Manila Bay casino project in 2008 it failed to secure the rights to develop more than a dozen ""road lots"", representing about a quarter of the site of a luxury complex it hopes to open in 2014. The titles to the lots were held by local developer Asiaworld Properties Philippine Corp, records show.Universal turned to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), the industry regulator, to find a solution to the road problem, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. PAGCOR declined to comment on its involvement.A PAGCOR lawyer assigned to the case helped broker an agreement in November 2009 under which Asiaworld gave Eagle I Landholdings Inc, a Universal affiliate, a free hand to consolidate and develop the road lots as it saw fit.Eagle I agreed to bear the cost of building an equivalent area of roads and open space, after which it would turn the land over to Paranaque City, the local municipality. The move relieved Asiaworld of its legal duty to develop the lots and donate them to Paranaque.There was no financial transaction written into the agreement, a certified copy obtained by Reuters shows.Paranaque Mayor Florencio Bernabe told Reuters that FBI agents visited him in January to ask about the agreement, which he signed, and related documents.Asiaworld did not have the funds to develop the roads and was happy to authorize Eagle I to shoulder that cost, a lawyer for the developer said. ""For us it was a welcome development,"" said Arcel Fetizanan, noting the move also eliminated its tax liabilities. ""It was a simple agreement. No cash involved.""The FBI declined to comment on the existence of a probe into the Soriano payments, citing its media policy. Philippine Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said an investigation by the NBI into the transfers to Soriano had been extended, but did not comment on specifics of the case.ACCOUNTING CHANGESUniversal initially accounted for $35 million paid to Soriano with an invoice and a corresponding contract indicating his firm be paid $28 million for solving the road problem and $7 million as a consultant fee, copies of the documents seen by Reuters show.Last month, Universal determined that $10 million was improperly routed through Soriano and back to the company, and revised its accounting for the payments. At the time it stood by the $25 million outlay as an investment in its Philippine project.A panel of experts hired by Universal to look into the payments determined the $25 million had been properly authorized but it has yet to pass judgment on whether the consulting fee was justified based on the services provided by Soriano.Universal's acknowledgement that the $25 million was unnecessary raises the prospect of another accounting revision. The Osaka Securities Exchange, which oversees its stock listing, had given Universal until Monday to present evidence justifying the payment, people familiar with the exchange's probe said."

The company has been involved in city masterplan projects in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.""In 20 years time you will find stores that sell books and DVDs replaced by sites that give people a reason to go the mall ... art galleries, education centers and health and spa treatments.""Florencio Beccar, fund manager of CBRE Global Investors European shopping centre fund, cited the recent purchase of a mall in Germany, saying the fact it included a large medical centre was ""a big plus"".""I once saw a clinic in a Brazilian mall where you checked in and are buzzed on a device when they are ready. In the meantime you go shopping,"" he said. ""With the ageing population in Europe you can see that happening more and more.""CBRE Investors, which has about 14 billion euros ($18.2 billion) of retail property under management in Europe and 5,000 tenants, also owns a mall in southern Sweden with a library and a local municipal office, he said.""More shopping centre developers will have early talks with these sorts of tenants as well as the big anchor retailers,"" Beccar said.Mall owners like Land Securities, Intu, Westfield and Klepierre have increased the number of restaurants and cinemas to persuade shoppers to stay longer, and offer promotions to reward frequent shoppers who can be tracked via their mobile phones.COMMUNITY CENTRES, ADVENTURE PARKSBut these steps don't go far enough, some experts say, in light of a forecast last month that 90 percent of retail sales growth in Britain, France and Germany between 2012 and 2016, or 91.5 billion euros, is expected to be online, according to the property arm of French insurer AXA, which manages 43 billion euros of assets.As well as changing what's inside, mall owners will need to borrow ideas from developing markets like Dubai and China where centers are part of wider mixed-use developments where people live or include open spaces where they spend leisure time, Roberts said.""Convenience and Internet shopping has created a breakdown in community structures and there's a gap there waiting to be filled,"" he said.""There is a complete lack of vision among many shopping centre owners,"" said Joe Valente, a managing director at JP Morgan Asset Management, who helps manage 7 billion euros of real estate in Europe.""The big thing that's missing is that unlike almost every other industry they haven't caught on to building their own brand. Why not have a bluewater.com?"" he said, referring to the large mall of the same name in southeast England.""Landlords fear cannibalizing sales but in 10 to 15 years they won't have a choice because they will be cannibalized anyway,"" he said. In other words, a growing number of shoppers will move online whatever malls do.""On a mall website you could book a parking space, a restaurant table or your car to be valeted.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist wrote in a blog post Sunday that the proposed bailout of the Cyprus banking system, which requires a tax on bank deposits, will push other Europeans to run to their banks in a panicked race to withdraw their money out of fear they'll face a similar tax. The Cyprus bailout is the first time European leaders have required depositors share the burden of rescuing a crisis-plagued European nation, which could open the door to including the requirement for bailouts of bigger countries like Spain, Italy or Greece. “It’s as if the Europeans are holding up a neon sign, written in Greek and Italian, saying ‘time to stage a run on your banks!’” Krugman wrote in the blog post. Talk of the bank deposit tax has already caused a run on the banks in Cyprus. Nervous account holders ran to the banks on Saturday to empty their accounts after Cyprus’ President Nicos Anastasiades said the country had little choice but to accept the $13 billion deal from the IMF and the country’s eurozone partners. Lawmakers in Cyprus postponed a vote on the proposal, which was scheduled to take place Sunday, until Monday. If lawmakers reject the deal, it could send Cyprus into bankruptcy and perhaps push it off the Euro, according to Reuters. In addition, officials expect Cyprus bank account holders to make a run on the banks Tuesday (Monday is a national holiday) no matter which way the vote turns out. "

And as bankers expressed concern the proposed terms of Cyprus's bailout could unnerve savers elsewhere, some leftist leaders voiced outrage.Euro zone finance ministers want Cypriots to pay up to 9.9 percent of their deposits in return for a 10 billion euro ($13 billion) aid package.

""In Greece, they have found other ways to rob us, more ingenious and sly ways -- with fuel taxes, property poll taxes, you name it."" The chief of Greece's main opposition, anti-bailout Syriza party, leftist Alexis Tsipras, blamed the move on German Chancellor Angela Merkel.""We must all together raise a shield to protect the peoples (of Europe) from Ms Merkel's criminal strategy,"" said Tsipras, who wants a pan-European debt conference to forgive debt.In Lisbon, Joao Semedo, leader of Left Bloc, one of the country's smaller left-wing parties, warned Portuguese deposits would be at risk if European creditors insist on more austerity.""The Portuguese government will not hesitate in resorting to bank deposits,"" said Semedo.Greece and Portugal, like Ireland and Spain, have received European aid to shore up their economies, in return for painful cuts to spending and tax hikes.In northern European countries, concerned at how much they might have to pay for bailing out indebted states, there was little sign of anxiety on Sunday. Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen said the levy was fair.European officials have been at pains to stress that Cyprus is a special case - with terms not applicable to other bailouts because of the size of Cyprus's banking sector and its large foreign deposits. NO SAVINGS TO WITHDRAWBut in Madrid, Ana Garcia, a 62-year-old worker at a mental health centre who was attending a protest against the privatisation of the health service on Sunday, thought Spaniards could also face a hit on their savings.""European countries are very calm thinking it could never happen to them.

Act I is a sendup of Chekhovian tropes with prescient views on real estate and familiar philosophical exclamations like ""I'm in mourning for my life!"" In Durang's whimsical mix master, as directed by Nicholas Martin, the tragic -- and neurotic -- circumstance of everyday life turns to high hilarity.Weaver's character, Masha, a superstar action hero like Weaver herself -- in the Sexy Killer movies -- makes for a most vulnerable Snow White, too tall, her lips too thin, mistaken for Norma Desmond, BoPeep, a Meissen figure.

In addition to Weaver's superb comic Tony worthy performance, and Magnussen's athletic eye candy, the play features a standout ensemble including David Hyde Pierce, as Masha's brother Vanya, Doc in costume, who in Act II delivers a most resonant ode to the past, extolling the virtues of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, where, as here on the tranquil pond, nothing happens.

All with their own hashtagged branding message.If last year was the year of the South by Southwest killer app, this was the year of the aspirational hashtag. Plastered on posts and building wraps all over Austin, hashtags brewed by marketing teams offered the chance to win entrance to not so secret ""secret"" shows.

Industry insiders gather to see what will still sell, whether it be some combination of branded streaming or old-fashioned touring until the wheels fall off. Labels are transitioning from disc to digital, commercials are the new A&R rep, crowdsourcing is the new cash advance and YouTube is the new publicist. In the musical instrument expo center, I saw a No Talent Required banner. Hoping that doesn't catch on.

Now Wonder Days is in rotation on the soundtrack of New Orleans, WWOZ-FM, and CD's are selling briskly at Louisiana Music Factory, on Amazon.com if you're not in New Orleans, and on iTunes.All this proves that as cynical as we can get about the prospect of anyone discovering anyone, it happens. After the Patrons of the Saint CD was released, Ogden Museum After Hours curator Libra LaGrone said she hasn't been so sure a band would make it since hearing Mumford & Sons in a hotel lobby at South by Southwest. When you believe in an album, CD, download, or whatever we're calling them now, that's music to your ears. So if you get a chance, give Wonder Days a spin on Soundcloud below. There's a guitar explosion halfway through. And Chichen Itza with its unique horn mix. And watch for Micah McKee and Little Maker at next year's South By Hashtag, or whatever we're calling it by then. In the meantime, rock on. Giant Grammy at Austin's NARAS Gathering."

On Sunday, it hit 286 on an index maintained by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which described the pollution as ""very unhealthy"".Nationally, environmental complaints have sparked unrest and even riots, to the alarm of the stability-obsessed ruling Communist Party.Beijing will set deadlines to tackle pollution caused by man-made factors, Li said, adding that the government will phase out ""backward production facilities"".""We need to face the situation and punish offenders with no mercy and enforce the law with an iron fist,"" Li said.""We shouldn't pursue economic growth at the expense of the environment. Such growth won't satisfy the people,"" he added.Li also promised a crackdown on fake and substandard food, another persistent problem which has caused widespread alarm, with scandals in recent years including toxic milk powder, and painted stones sold as rice.The government will ""take strong measures to punish the heartless producers of substandard and fake food so they will pay a high price"", Li said.
