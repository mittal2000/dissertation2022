Welcome to Truk Lagoon (also known as Chuuk Lagoon), home to one of the world's largest ship graveyards, courtesy of a surprise Allied attack during World War II on one of Japan's largest naval bases. The attack, known as ""Operation Hailstone,"" sunk more than 70 Japanese ships, planes, and submarines. Thousands of Japanese sailors were killed, and according to the Pacific Daily News, many still remain in their watery graves, undisturbed.Nearly 70 years later, the lagoon has become a major tourist destination. Divers can explore what is now a legally-protected underwater museum. Disturbing or removing any of the underwater relics can draw fines and possible jail time, according to Pacific Wrecks, a non-profit dedicated to preserving the area's history.And if the prospect of swimming through coral-coated sunken submarines doesn't get your adrenaline pumping, there's also this tidbit, via Pacific Wrecks: Caustic substances like high octane aviation fuel, oils, gasoline and acid exist on many of the wrecks. Explosives, mines, munitions, detonators, torpedoes and shells are still ""live"".Surrounding the wreckage, at depths varying from just below the surface to more than 200 feet, lies what The Earthwatch Institute, a nonprofit environmental charity, has termed ""a diverse array of marine life."" Sharks, manta-rays, and turtles all inhabit the area in addition to at least 266 different species of reef fish and a rare coral, Acropora pichoni.The lagoon itself is part of the Federated States of Micronesia, a cluster of more than 600 islands located approximately 1,800 miles northeast of Australia.PHOTOS of the lagoon and some of its wreckage:"

So, I interviewed the owners and wedding managers at five of my favorite locations. In Part 1 of this article, I'll give you a look at each of them with links to their websites and contact information. In Part 2 next week, I'll summarize the inside scoop I gathered from the following five fabulous venues.Onteora Mountain House PO Box 356 | 96 Piney Point Road | Boiceville, NY 12412 | 845-657-6233 Interviewees: Bob McBroom, Proprietor and Jeremy Hudler, Event Manager Photo Credit: Eric Ekroth PhotographyOnteora, located 100 miles north of New York City in the heart of the Catskill State Park, is available for weddings from May to October. They host about 30 weddings each year with an average size of 120 guests and a maximum of 200. Almost all couples who marry here come from the New York City area to have a weekend destination wedding with exclusive use of the facilities, including seven guest rooms, surrounded by family and friends in this private, sophisticated enclave overlooking the breathtaking Esopus Valley. Outdoor ceremonies typically take place on the 90-foot deck overlooking the majesty of the mountains.

To say Mohonk is unique is an understatement -- this legendary Victorian castle built in 1869 on spectacular cliffs above Lake Mohonk is a mountaintop resort just 90 miles north of New York City. It offers 259 guest rooms, awe-inspiring views and encounters with nature's beauty, a family-friendly atmosphere, and an award-winning spa. About half of the 60-70 couples who choose Mohonk for their weddings each year have some tie to the thousands of acres of pristine forest and winding trails it offers. Many have hiked in the area or their families have visited Mohonk for generations. Others are delighted to discover Mohonk for the first time. Vow renewal ceremonies and anniversary celebrations offer another special way to bring family and friends together as the centerpiece of a family reunion.

An hour north of Manhattan, the Garrison's 300 stunning acres offer a spectacular countryside retreat with critically-acclaimed cuisine, impeccable service, Hudson River and mountain views, and sophisticated elegance in a natural setting. The Garrison has an ""eat local philosophy"" -- serving local, organic meats, vegetables, and herbs. Most outdoor weddings take place under the pergola in the Ceremony Garden. Constructed of carefully inter-woven bittersweet vines, the pergola can be left natural or decorated with flowers and greenery. The north-westerly facing garden frequently has unforgettable sunsets. Most indoor ceremonies are now in the new Hudson Room, designed by Sharon Davis Design Studio and offering a panoramic 360-degree view that brings the outdoors inside.Regarding his preferred vendor list, Todd says ""I hand select vendors -- they have to be gracious, gracious people to ensure that all Garrison weddings offer the best expertise from the best officiants, photographers, florists, and other vendors the Hudson Valley has to offer.""

Bill Gates is in Canberra today to lobby the government for increased spending on foreign aid. The Labor government announced it will slow it's growth in foreign aid spending after a $19.4AUD billion budget deficit was revealed in May. (Photo by Stefan Postles/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d36622500003600365e69.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows."" -- BuddhaBill Gates is a rare breed. He defies what most billionaires appear to be: trapped in the hoarding of money with a large dose of poverty mind. While most people are obsessed with getting money, Gates wants to give it away.By the time he was 32, Gates was a billionaire; in May this year he was declared the richest man in the world with a net worth of over $72 billion. He stopped working at Microsoft five years ago in order to focus on using that money to make the world a better place. He and his wife founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with investor Warren Buffett. The primary aims of the foundation are to enhance health care and reduce extreme poverty. To begin, Gates is committed to ending polio by 2018, with tuberculosis and malaria to follow. Although, obviously, few of us have money to spare like Gates or Buffett, and it is easy to applaud them while feeling useless ourselves, it doesn't mean we can't give or help another in need, using whatever means we have. ""A generous heart, kind speech, and a life of service and compassion are the things that renew humanity."" -- BuddhaWe were in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala, in northern India, attending the Dalai Lama's teachings. It was crowded, cold, and very uncomfortable sitting close together on mats on a concrete floor. Deb was longing to go back to our hotel room so she could meditate quietly on her own when the Dalai Lama start talking about the dangers of solitary peace. He spoke of how tempting it can be to want to be on our own, but how easily this can disengage us from the reality around us. That it is vital to be in communication, engaged in giving, sharing and caring for each other. Wise spiritual teachers from all traditions have taught how the path of service is the most important of all, as it means we are less self-obsessed; through caring for others we can step out of indulgence and into big-heartedness, releasing any sense of separateness. ""Just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue."" -- BuddhaThe generosity Gates is sharing is not the stuff many rich people are made of. It can be very difficult to give when you have so much, as it incites tremendous fear of loss. We only have to look at the upper 1 percent of this country to see how greed and selfishness rule the day, as they hide their money in offshore accounts, avoid paying fair taxes, and have little time for the poor or needy. When we feel uncomfortable with generosity we get stuck in our limitations and fear. When we appreciate the joy of kindness our life is transformed. We can both give and receive. Such egoless moments are exquisite!We may think we have little to offer but whether it is a few pennies or a whole bankroll, a cup of tea or a banquet is irrelevant -- it is the act of giving itself that is important. Mahatma Gandhi famously said, ""You must be the change you want to see in the world."" In other words, although life changes are inevitable we can initiate personal change so that we rise to the challenge and become a bigger and better person as a result. As Mahatma Gandhi also said, ""Almost anything we do will seem insignificant, but it is very important that we do it.""""Be generous. Give to those you love; give to those who love you, give to the fortunate, give to the unfortunate -- yes, give especially to those you don't want to give. You will receive abundance for your giving. The more you give, the more you will have!"" -- W. Clement StoneAs one of our teachers, Sri Swami Satchidananda taught: ""Who is the most selfish person? It is the one who is most selfless! Why? Because by being selfless, you will always retain your happiness. A selfish person can never be really happy. So to be happier, be more selfless!""""I slept and dreamt that life was joy I awoke and saw that life was service I acted and behold, service was joy.""-- Rabindranath TagoreWould you rather give or receive?

Sure, they're really healthy. And they make a good gluten-free option. But that's not the reason to eat them. The only reason to eat lettuce wraps is because they taste really good -- and they're the perfect meal for when the heat outside makes the thought of eating unbearable. (Because no matter how hot it gets, we still need to eat.)These lettuce wraps are filled with the spicy Asian chicken salad that also happens to be one of the easiest recipes around. Starting with store-bought rotisserie chicken, you can put this whole meal together without having to turn on one appliance in your kitchen.
