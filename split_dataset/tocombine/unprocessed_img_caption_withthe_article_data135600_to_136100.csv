Each was accompanied by a text by the chef and a detailed recipe; they are all linked at the end of Mr. Bittman's own, very non-cheffy, contribution. My favorite was the great André Soltner's pumpkin soup, not only because Jackie and I have the fondest memories of the man and his sorely-missed New York restaurant, Lutèce, but because it included two unexpected ingredients: turnips among the vegetables and a thickener of crisp croutons, which were simmered in the soup for 30 minutes before the whole thing was pureed. There's something Alsatian about using toasty wheat as a source of a particular flavor, and as a liaison.But the video that I acted on was of Claudia Fleming making a crumb-topped apple crostata with bacon-toffee sauce. Or at least I sort of acted on it; it's more that it reminded me of a differently flavored, sauce- and crumb-less, but similarly free-form apple tart/pie I hadn't made in some time. Probably twenty-five years ago, this was originally intended to imitate the inimitable tart sold at the Poilâne bakery in Paris; such mimicry was a doomed enterprise, but I did manage to bake a good apple pie that sort of, kind of looked like its model. At least it contained apples piled up in the center of a rough circle of dough whose border was then folded around the fruit.For me at least, it turned out that this method, where a single piece of dough both supports and contains the filling and which is baked right on a paper-lined sheet pan, removed most of the barriers to baking apple pie (rolling the dough to a particular size; laying it into a pan; rolling out more dough for a top crust; creating a seal between top and bottom). It is actually meant to look a little messy, so perfection is easy to achieve. So, for a number of years, I'd make it fairly regularly. Then came Jackie's Polish-style apple pie/cake: her famous Szarlotka. This would eclipse just about any apple dessert in the repertory, and it certainly supplanted my free-form effort.Then, that video reminded me of it. Plus -- and this of course was key -- there was a disc of pastry all ready in the fridge: I'd made it a couple of days earlier thinking I might have the will to make a butternut squash pie. (Ha! I wound up using the squash to make nice gnocchi-like dumplings.) The pastry was made from 6 ounces of all-purpose flour, 4 ounces of butter, salt and simple syrup: For sweet pastry I replace the cold water with simple syrup if I have any in the fridge -- it is much easier to roll out than pastry made with granulated sugar.I heated the oven to 400 degrees F (a little over 200 degrees C) and prepared the apples: Three big ones (I used a mixture of New York State varieties) or four not-so-big ones -- better to have too much than not enough - peeled, halved, cored and cut into quarter-inch slices. As I sliced them I added them to a bowl containing the juice of half a big lemon and the grated zest of the whole lemon. When they were all sliced, I added a small handful of raisins, perhaps a quarter cup of dark brown sugar, a tiny drizzle of vanilla extract, a sprinkling of nutmeg and a couple of teaspoons of good brandy -- use Cognac or Armagnac if you have any, or substitute something like calvados, rum or kirsch (or omit the booze). I tossed to combine.As this macerated, I rolled the pastry out into a twelve-inch circle, or as close to a circle as I could get it, and set it onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper (the paper will help when you remove the finished tart from the pan. I mounded the apples into the center and spread them, leaving a border of about two inches all around. I topped the fruit with a few thin slices of butter (I could have added melted or cubed butter to the mixture too), then folded the pastry border over the fruit, pleating and pressing with my hands as needed. This can be as messy as it wants to be, so long as the apples are contained and the outermost edge of the mound is covered, leaving six inches or so uncovered at the center of the tart.The fruit will have left some juice in the bowl, brown with sugar, tart with lemon and aromatic with brandy. Use your fingers (or a brush if you must) to spread most of this onto the pastry border, then sprinkle with granulated sugar -- this will create some crunch when the tart is baked.Put it into the fully heated oven; if you have a pizza stone, place the sheet pan atop this to speed the crisping of the bottom. After a few minutes, lower the temperature to 375 F (190 F) and bake for about 40 minutes more, shifting it from the pizza stone to a rack about halfway through if you think of it; let it be as brown as possible without charring. Some juice may run, and this may caramelize, but it is unlikely to burn.Let the tart rest for a minute or two, then use the parchment paper to slide it onto a cooling rack -- doing this quickly will help keep the bottom crisp. When it has cooled to tepid, a long spatula will help you move it from the paper to a serving plate.Serve tepid or cool, not hot if timing permits. Next day, I love the leftovers straight out of the fridge, and Jackie is slowly coming round to that preference too.Once you've got the pastry made (four times out of five, I do it in a food processor) this is probably the easiest of all apple pies/tarts to assemble and bake. It is also one of the half dozen best."

The National Transportation Safety Board reported Monday that the train Rockefeller was driving was going 82 mph around a 30-mph curve when it derailed killing four people and injuring more than 60. (AP Photo/Robert Stolarik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db1a53c000066000a3ff0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Reports are not yet conclusive on what caused a speeding Metro-North train to derail early Sunday morning in the Bronx, killing four passengers and injuring more than 60. But what is certain is that the crash forever changed the lives of the train’s engineer and hundreds of its passengers.The accident has also launched a conversation about the consequences of sleep deprivation and fatigue, since various reports claim that the Metro-North engineer, William Rockefeller Jr., was not fully at attention -- and possibly asleep -- in the moments before, or during, the accident.The train was reportedly traveling 82 miles per hour when it crashed, more than twice the 30 mph speed limit of the curve where the derailment occurred, just north of Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx. An unnamed law enforcement source told Newsday that Rockefeller may have zoned out in the fateful moments before the crash, waking up too late to stop the train from speeding off the tracks. Anthony Bottalico, executive director of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees, the union representing Metro-North crew members, said that Rockefeller told him he ""basically nodded [off].""""Employees are required to have at least eight hours of rest or off time before a shift,"" Metro-North spokesman Aaron Donovan told The Huffington Post. ""If an employee has worked a 12-hour shift at any point within the last 24 hours, they must take at least 10 hours of rest before reporting to another shift."" Metro-North's policies regarding sleep deprivation on the job are mandated by the Federal Railroad Administration. According to the National Transportation and Safety Board, Rockefeller was well-rested and had not been drinking at the time of the accident. The engineer was injured but conscious after the crash, and was rushed to NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center to be treated for injuries that remain undisclosed. He has been cooperating fully with investigators, DNAinfo New York reported. For now, there is no concrete evidence that Rockefeller had been overworked or had not gotten enough sleep the night before the deadly crash, sources told DNAinfo New York. Rockefeller's work schedule and runs are currently being investigated to determine if he was overworked, and investigators are looking into when he last slept before Sunday's trip, sources told Newsday. While the conversation around sleep deprivation in the transportation industry has never attained the prominence of those around driving while drunk or texting while driving, the hazards are well documented. One in four train operators say that fatigue affects their job performance at least once a week, according to a 2012 National Sleep Foundation poll. Other industries have instituted regulations including blood tests, extra hours between shifts, sleep disorder screening and shift limitations to prevent sleep deprivation-related accidents from occurring. The Railroaders' Guide to Healthy Sleep, a resource provided by the Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine, is also working to bring awareness to sleep deprivation issues in the industry and provide information and help for transportation workers. Investigations into the deadly derailment are ongoing, but while some details about the circumstances of the crash are emerging, little is known about the engineer driving the train, whose life has also been irrevocably changed by the accident. Bottalico of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees told The Journal News that Rockefeller is ""totally traumatized"" by the tragedy.Though Rockefeller has yet to speak with the media, it is known he was an experienced engineer with a""good reputation,"" as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at a news conference Monday. Rockefeller also has no documented history of work-related issues or infractions. “He’s a sincere human being with an impeccable record, that I know of,” Bottalico added. “He’s diligent and competent.”The 46-year-old resident of Germantown in upstate New York is a veteran employee of Metro-North Railroads. Rockefeller has worked with the company for the past 20 years, and has been employed in his current role as an engineer for the past 11 years. Rockefeller grew up in Rhinebeck, N.Y., where his father owned a construction business, Rockefeller Builders. Rhinebeck Mayor James Reardon told The Journal News that he's known ""Billy"" since he was a child, and that he is a ""conscientious and dedicated guy.""“[Rockefeller] is a great guy, humble and very caring,"" Reardon said. ""My thoughts and prayers are with him.” Rockefeller also serves as a volunteer rescue worker and fire fighter, according to his uncle, 49-year-old Jan Timothy Rockefeller, New York Daily News reported. The engineer's uncle told the Daily News that his nephew always put safety first. “Everything he did, he did in a safe manner,"" the elder Rockefeller said. “Everything with him was safety.” "

The storm, which threatens 50 million people in the eastern third of the U.S., is expected to bring days of rain, high winds and possibly heavy snow. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the closure of all New York City's bus, subway and commuter rail service as of Sunday evening. (Photo by Allison Joyce/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9daa0f2400005000952a84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rates of clinically diagnosed depression are going down in the areas hardest hit by Superstorm Sandy, according to a new Gallup report. Before Sandy hit, the percentage of residents with clinical depression in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ZIP codes hardest hit by Sandy was 12 percent (between Sept. 15 and Oct. 28, 2012). Right after Sandy -- between Nov. 1 and Dec. 15 -- that number increased to 15 percent. But a year later, Gallup researchers found that the percentage has gone down to 10 percent. This same trend was seen for the other areas of the tri-state area that were not as affected by the storm: 16 percent of these people had clinical depression between Sept. 15 and Oct. 28, and the number grew to 18 percent between Nov. 1 and Dec. 15. But between Sept. 1 and Nov. 6 of this year, 15 percent reported clinical depression. Similarly, feelings of worry seem to have dissipated in the most hard-hit areas; before Sandy, 32 percent of people in these areas reported daily worry, and that number rose to 37 percent after Sandy. But a year later, the percentage of people experiencing daily worry went back down to 28 percent. However, it's not all good news; Gallup researchers also found that daily feelings of anger have increased a year post-Sandy in these hard-hit regions. Before Sandy, 12 percent of people in these regions reported daily anger, with that number rising slightly to 13 percent right after Sandy. But a year later, the number is now 16 percent. ""As FEMA indicates in their National Disaster Recovery Framework, recovery means much more than removing debris and ensuring housing for those displaced. The emotional toll of the event on a massive scale can be difficult to address, and changing emotional responses are likely to persist beyond the immediate aftermath,"" the Gallup researchers wrote in the report. The findings are based on 6,414 phone interviews conducted throughout 2012 and 2013 in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, as well as 2,995 interviews conducted between Sept. 1 and Nov. 6 of this year.
