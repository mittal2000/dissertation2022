For the first time ever, their children ceased to become economic assets capable of contributing to the family's prosperity and started to become a financial burden. And yet, in spite of this daunting reality, Americans continued to produce offspring at nearly historic rates for the next 50 to 75 years. What was their motivation? Surely it was more than just a desire to accumulate mountains of fingerpaint art. Come along as we explore 6 of the top 10 hidden benefits of having children.Children Lower Your Blood Pressure A recent study conducted at Brigham Young University found that parenthood may actually help lower your blood pressure. Researchers at the school hooked up 200 married men and women to blood pressure monitors for 24 hours and found that couples with children had significantly lower blood-pressure readings than those without offspring. ""While caring for children may include daily hassles, deriving a sense of meaning and purpose from life's stress has been shown to be associated with better health outcomes,"" says Julianne Holt-Lunstad, the lead researcher. ""This doesn't mean the more kids you have, the better your blood pressure. The findings are simply tied to parenthood, no matter the number of children or employment status.""Children Entitle You To Major Tax Savings It used to be the only way you could make money off of your children was by sending them into the coal mines. But now, thanks to the IRS, your children allow you to qualify for some very valuable tax savings -- a notable hidden benefit of having children. According to one recently published study, the average family can save $3,500 per year simply by claiming child tax credits, education credits, and child- and dependent-care credits. ""These tax credits shouldn't spur you to have a child,"" says U.S. tax attorney Roni Deutch, ""but since the projected cost of raising a child to the age of 18 is just shy of $200,000, parents need all the help they can get.""Children Get You Better Parking  Shopping with children is seldom easy, but there is one enormous perk to taking your rug rat to the mall: better parking. Many shopping centers, grocery stores and factory outlets now have parking spaces reserved especially for families and pregnant women. Not only are these spots conveniently located, but they're also usually vacant. As an added bonus, you can also drive in the HOV lane on your way to the store since even the smallest newborn legally counts as a full-fledged passenger.Children Keep You Sane Contrary to popular belief, children don't always drive their parents crazy. In fact, researchers at Taiwan's Mental Health Foundation claim they may even keep their parents sane well beyond their years. The organization recently interviewed 1,084 randomly selected senior citizens and found that seniors with no children scored 6.4 points lower on a mental health questionnaire than elderly subjects with children. ""The results shows that people who have children are happier and have greater satisfaction and emotional well-being than those without children,"" says Tom Yang, the study's lead researcher.Children Renew Your Thirst For Knowledge Anyone who has children can attest that their child's favorite word is ""why."" Kids constantly want to know the answer to a variety of head-scratching questions like, ""Why do a cat's eyes shine in the dark?"", ""Why does it smell so fresh after it rains?"" and ""Why do Mommy and Daddy always lock their bedroom door on Tuesday nights?"" You may not have the answer to all of these queries (well, two-thirds of them anyhow), but they're sure to get your wheels turning as you attempt to formulate a plausible-sounding response. As your children get older, you'll also get to brush up on your education by relearning your multiplication tables, the names of every state bird and the capital of Liechtenstein (it's Vaduz, in case you were wondering).Children Make You Sexier Think puppies are the ultimate chick magnet? Think again. Any father will tell you there's no better way of attracting attention from the fairer sex than by strolling through a park with an adorable baby. Heck, even an ugly baby will do the trick, since most women are responding more to the father's sense of dedication and maturity than they are to the fruit of his loins. Who knew that a $200 stroller could elicit more oohs and aahs than a $200,000 sports car?Curious to see if there are really four more benefits to having children? We swear we're not lying.

4,FIFTY,Mother's Day Carved a Hole in My Heart: A Noisy Spirit Speaks Out,"Kathy Eldon, ContributorFounder and President, Creative Visions Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/noisy-spirits-on-mothers-_b_5302197.html,"This year, I didn't dread Mother's Day, because I found an antidote to the deep sorrow it used to trigger within me. I hope by sharing my story that I can help others find peace -- and even joy -- after the loss of a child.",2014-05-14,2014-05-10-1381454_10151880163936201_1012500939_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-10-1381454_10151880163936201_1012500939_n-thumb.jpg,"Whew, I made it through Mother's Day intact this year. Mothers who have lost a child know that a holiday which should be joyous can literally suck the life-force out of you. Regardless whether your child died in utero, or was pushing 65, it's not right to have a child die before a mother. It's supposed to be the other way around. Amy Eldon Turteltaub and Kathy Eldon launch the Noisy Spirits Club: Julie Ellerton PhotographyFor years, I dreaded the day when the glaring absence of my son Dan, a Reuters photojournalist killed in Somalia at the age of 22, carved an even deeper hole in my soul. Despite the efforts of my daughter, Amy, four years younger than Dan, to make it feel happy, I resented Hallmark for foisting the holiday on me, and, to be honest, I also unfairly resented other mothers who still had their full quotient of offspring.This year, I didn't dread Mother's Day, because I found an antidote to the deep sorrow it used to trigger within me. I hope by sharing my story that I can help others find peace -- and even joy -- after the loss of a child.Soon after Dan was killed, I recall myself on the floor, sobbing and writhing, when I heard a little voice in my head say, ""Don't worry, everything's going to be all right."" Startled, I sat up and looked around me, for the voice seemed to be my son's. I leaned forward and listened inside, aware that I was being urged to do something to transform Dan's death, something that would help me get through the intense pain that I was feeling. I had no idea what I might do, but I knew I had to do something. The prompt was to lead me on a healing journey that continues to this day.Curiously enough, just making the commitment to finding purpose seemed to help me get through the difficult weeks and months that followed. Suddenly I had a reason to get out of bed and engage in the world around me. I started simply, tending a potted plant that I bought in honor of Dan, then I helped create an exhibit of his photographs and those of the three young men who died with him. Feeling the deep loss of my son in my life, I decided to unofficially adopt what I called my ""fairy godchildren,"" young people whose energy stirred new life in me. Over time, those wonderful individuals, scattered around the world, have brought me love and joy beyond my wildest imaginings.As I made my way through the dark tunnel that engulfed me, I often felt as though Dan was guiding me, nudging, cajoling, urging; an often noisy, sometimes annoying spirit who wouldn't let me rest until I found my way to the light -- and to new meaning in my life. Whether that ""noisy spirit"" was just a figment of my imagination or real doesn't really matter, because just having a way to celebrate and commemorate my son has helped me heal.In 1998, my daughter Amy and I launched Creative Visions Foundation to support 'creative activists' like Dan, who use media and the arts to catalyze change. It's a global organization now, offering a home for more than 200 projects and productions that create awareness and ignite action. As we have traveled around the world for the foundation, we have met many other individuals who have lost loved ones, and like us, have found new purpose and meaning in their lives by creating projects, organizations -- even movies or movements as a result of that loss.Their stories have inspired us to start the ""Noisy Spirits Club,"" an informal gathering of people who have done something to commemorate and celebrate the person who is no longer physically present. This week, we'll celebrate the noisy spirits of other mothers who have lost a child: Julie Garner, who turned the loss of her son, Hunter, into a national movement against texting while driving and Ellen Shane, who has founded a vital organization after the death of her daughter, Emily, killed by a reckless driver. Each of these ""Noisy Spirits"" is a vital - and inspiring - force for good.You can read their stories -- and more -- on Sanctri.com, a Facebook app that provides a safe place for you to commemorate and celebrate someone who has died -- and to find new purpose and meaning in your life. Please share stories about others who have found new meaning after death on Sanctri -- and tell us who else should join our Noisy Spirits Club!Kathy Eldon is co-founder of Sanctri. Her memoir, ""In the Heart of Life,"" (Harper One) describes her journey from the loss of her son Dan to launch the creative activist movement."
5,TASTE,Cooking Off The Cuff: Still Waiting For Spring -- Pasta With Sausage And Cabbage,"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-stil_b_5297696.html,Put it in the oven for a few minutes and you've got the kind of baked pasta that everyone adores.,2014-05-14,Browning Italian sausage meat with a little onion and a little garlic,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e10f2250000350036b2eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The other week I said I wouldn't whine about the late arrival of spring produce at New York City farmers' markets, so I'll merely observe that what I found in my refrigerator the other day was the remains of a head of cabbage. It was still crisp and sweet, so there'd really have been nothing to complain about even if I hadn't promised to keep my mouth shut. I used it to make an easy pasta dish that may sound wintry but in fact is pleasing at any time of year: Penne with sausage and cabbage. More often than not, when Jackie and I eat pasta with cabbage, its broad, sturdy homemade noodles incorporating buckwheat flour and no eggs, as in this variation on northern Italian pizzoccheri. There, the balance between cabbage and buckwheat is maintained by keeping other ingredients to a minimum: Bacon and leeks are used more as a seasoning than as a center of attention.But with regular dried durum wheat pasta (any short shape would work for this dish, not just penne), the accompaniment can be more assertive -- off-the-shelf pasta has nothing to prove. For two portions, I sliced cored cabbage into 1/2-inch (10 or 12 mm) strips, enough to make a good double handful, rinsed it and left it in a sieve to drain. Then, while half an onion, thinly sliced, was sweating in olive oil with just one clove of garlic, sliced likewise, I extracted the meat from a couple of sweet Italian-style sausages with fennel seed (you can use any kind you like) and added it to the skillet in blobs, breaking it up into smaller blobs with a spoon as it browned. When it was brown but not entirely cooked, I deglazed with white wine, let it reduce, then added around 2/3 cup (160 ml) chicken stock (vegetable stock or water would have been fine) and just a third of a cup tomato sauce -- a squirt of tomato paste would be viable too. I also added salt, pepper and some herbs: sage would have been ideal, but I didn't have any so used slivered parsley and a few needles of rosemary, chopped. I set more of these herbs aside for later. If I'd felt like it, I could have added a sprinkle of dried hot chilies as well.When the mixture came to the simmer, I stirred in the cabbage and cooked it over medium heat, partially covered (so the liquid would reduce and get more flavorful) until tender.Remarkably, I'd had the foresight to bring a big pot of salted water to the boil, and a couple of minutes after the cabbage went into the sausage mixture the penne went into the water. The cabbage was tender before the pasta was done, so I left it uncovered off the heat for the few minutes it took the penne to catch up. Then I turned the heat under the skillet back to medium-high and stirred in the drained pasta. I'd saved some of the pasta water to loosen the sauce, but between the wine, the stock and the tomatoes it was fine the way it was. I checked for salt and pepper; it needed pepper and it also needed the rest of the parsley and rosemary to perk up the herb flavors. In the serving bowl, I topped it with grated pecorino cheese (heartier than parmesan).The sausage and tomato part of this dish is entirely familiar -- omit the greens, add more tomatoes, top it with mozzarella, put it in the oven for a few minutes and you've got the kind of baked pasta that everyone adores. But the cabbage -- an everyday vegetable if ever there was one -- makes it seem surprisingly exotic. We expect broccoli di rape or Swiss chard in these dishes, not big strips of a vegetable we associate more with northern climes.And, let we forget, we are in northern climes for at least a few more weeks. Not that I'm complaining."

Some rehab,"" says Jim Eggleston, an attorney who represents Sid's owners, Jamie and Marian Harris, in a $1 million lawsuit against the veterinarian and his practice, the now-closed Camp Bowie Animal Clinic in Fort Worth.The veterinarian is 71-year-old Millard ""Lou"" Tierce, who told the Texas State Veterinary Board of Medical Examiners at a hearing last week that he was ""too busy"" to euthanize and then bury Sid and a handful of other animals whose owners thought their pets were dead. Tierce reportedly said that he didn't have enough room in his freezer for the pets' bodies.""Thank God he didn't have room,"" says Eggleston.  The Harris family, including Jamie, from left, Cole, Case and Marian, pose with their dog Sid at their home in Aledo, Texas, April 26, 2014. Photo credit: Richard W. Rodriguez/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/MCT via Getty ImagesIn their petition filed in state court, the Harrises say that Tierce -- their trusted, longtime veterinarian -- kept Sid at the clinic for several months over the summer of 2013 while treating the dog for a ""minor, anal-gland issue."" That fall, when the family went to collect their pet, they found him unable to walk. ""He could not lift his hind quarters at all and simply slid himself across the floor to get to Mr. Harris,"" reads the complaint. Tierce allegedly first told the Harrises that Sid was having a reaction to some medicine, then said X-rays had revealed a congenital spinal defect that was ""degenerative and incurable."" (The family now believes that Sid was injured when a clinic employee flipped the dog onto his back.) The Harrises say the veterinarian advised them to euthanize Sid. They agreed, after being told the procedure would be painless and Sid would be buried on the Tierce family farm.On April 22, 2014, Mary Brewer, a veterinary technician formerly with the clinic, contacted the Harrises to tell them that Sid ""(a) was still alive; (b) was being confined in a cage almost 24 hours a day in unsanitary conditions (typically being removed from his cage only once each day and for not more than 15 minutes); and (c) was being used for blood extraction,"" according to the complaint. Brewer has also said that Sid and other animals had been used for medical experimentation, though no details have emerged, Eggleston tells HuffPost.“We trusted the vet. We said our goodbyes,” Marian Harris told ABC News. “We had even talked about burial arrangements, and then six months later I get a call that he’s still alive.”The family went to the clinic and recovered their dog. Another vet examined Sid, and concluded he'd been ""abusively kenneled,"" resulting in various ailments -- mange and muscle atrophy among them. The new vet said it also appeared Sid had been used as a ""regular blood donor"" and determined the dog ""definitively had no congenital spine defect,"" according to the Harris' complaint.Tierce was arrested at the end of April and charged with animal cruelty. The arrest warrant didn't mention Sid. Instead, it detailed Tierce's alleged cruelty to his own dog -- a border collie police found in obvious pain with a missing foot, a dislocated leg and two dislocated shoulders. The dog was lying in a box on the floor of Camp Bowie, in what was described in the warrant as a ""deplorable"" environment, with animal organs in jars ""throughout the clinic,"" as well as ""stacks of drugs, trash, laundry, paperwork"" and insects in exam rooms.The border collie was euthanized after being taken away from Tierce, as were two other dogs. One of those dogs had been caged for as many as three years after the dog's owners were told their pet was put down, Tierce reportedly said in a statement to the veterinary board. ""The only criminal charges so far,"" says Eggleston, ""have been about his own dog."" Fort Worth veterinarian Dr. Millard Tierce. Photo credit: AP Photo/Tarrant County Sheriff's OfficeThe Fort Worth Star Telegram reports that Tierce's attorney, in his opening statement at the veterinary board hearing last week, claimed his client had been wrongly characterized as a ""vampire running a shop of horror"":He asked Tierce why he kept jars of animal organs throughout the clinic. Tierce said he kept them around in case he needed more biopsies from them, but he knew he kept them too long.Tierce also told the board he had used Sid's blood for a transfusion -- though claimed he'd only done it once, to save a client's Brittany spaniel. He said he now understood what he'd done was wrong.“If I’m not M.L. Tierce, veterinarian, I am nothing,” he reportedly said. “I’m asking for the opportunity to continue to be a veterinarian.""The hearing ended with Tierce's temporary suspension still in effect. A full board will review Tierce's license again, possibly in October, a spokesperson told the Star-Telegram. HuffPost couldn't reach Tierce's lawyer for further comment.Despite the shocking details that Tierce has admitted to, the veterinarian still has supporters. Some 50 of them came to his hearing, and more than 100 have been sharing strategies on the ""Support Dr. Lou Tierce, Camp Bowie Animal Clinic"" Facebook page to help the man they say has done so much for them and their animals.""I'm sure you are all aware of the hoarding tendencies, disorganization and overall general mess of the place... I know that even without seeing patients the staff will still have a hard time getting things in order,"" wrote one. ""My idea to help Dr. Tierce is to volunteer to help get the place up to code and organized."""

Reutestrong/AFPAt the time of this writing, Jarba was scheduled to meet with National Security Advisor Susan Rice, with the hope that President Barack Obama would eventually drop by and participate. If in fact this plan holds, it will provide Jarba with the best opportunity to lobby the White House for a change in policy. Or, more specifically, enough of a change in policy that would provide the Syrian opposition with the capability needed to combat Assad's biggest military advantage: air power. If press reports are any indication, Jarba will not utilize that opening. In an interview last Sunday with The Wall Street Journal, Jarba did not mince words about what he hoped to accomplish before leaving town:""Our mission,"" Jarba said, ""is to convince the U.S. to give us those [anti-aircraft] weapons, or to convince them to allow our friends to provide us with those weapons."" Gen. Bashir picked up on the same theme in nearly the exact same language in comments to The Daily Beast: ""The main purpose for our visit is to get anti-aircraft weapons to protect innocent civilians inside Syria, and we are hoping the United States is going to help us push aside Assad's air force.""The question, however, has always been whether the administration will accede to those wishes. A spokeswoman for the National Security Council responded to the WSJ and Beast by saying that the Obama administration's policy on the MANPAD issue will continue as is:We [the White House] have not changed our position. We have made very clear publicly our concerns about this particular system because it has a proliferation risk that does not serve our interests.The challenge for Jarba and Bashir when they visit the White House is to break through a status-quo that the administration views as a wise play in what has turned out to be an unpredictable, seesaw-like battle between and among proxies and sectarian militias in the heart of the Middle East. If I were a betting man, I would wager on the side of the status-quo. Unfortunately, the prime losers are the Syrian people -- men, women and children -- deliberately targeted by a regime that long ago exhibited its true colors. It also happens to be a type of caution that does not serve the Obama administration's overall policy well, for without stiff resistance from the armed opposition, it will be impossible to get Bashar al-Assad to engage in the type of substantive political negotiations that is the best mechanism to end the conflict.UPDATE as of May 14, 2014: The White House has released this readout to the public about National Security Adviser Susan Rice's meeting with SNC President Ahmad al-Jarba. As expected, President Obama ""dropped by"" the meeting and spoke with Jarba about the need for the political opposition to incorporate as many Syrians of different ethnicities and sectarian affiliations as possible. No mention of additional weapons shipments to the moderate rebels. The statement can be read in full here."

11,POLITICS,What I Realized When I Finally Decided To Sign Up For Food Stamps,"Dennis Powers, ContributorInternet technologist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/middle-class-food-stamps_b_5307489.html,"These were not the dregs of society looking for a handout. These were working people, just
like me, who just needed some help. This was a shocking reminder of what
has become of the middle class.",2014-05-14,"NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 11: Harlem residents choose free groceries at the Food Bank For New York City on December 11, 2013 in New York City. The food bank distributes dry, canned and fresh food to needy residents and works with community based member programs to provide some 400,000 free meals per day throughout the city. Need increased in November when 47 million low-income people nationwide saw their food stamps cut as the federal SNAP program expired. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c8662400005100576e79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I have previously written how three days before my 60th birthday I came to a decision that I once considered unthinkable. On that day, I gathered up my financial information, took my book, entered the Social Services office in Waterbury, Connecticut, and asked if there was someone I could see to obtain some assistance. I pretty much already knew for what I was eligible, and had known for the past year, but since I was self employed I needed help to complete the forms that are designed for those on an hourly pay. I needed to talk to someone.The receptionist behind the glass partition took my name and social security number and directed me to the waiting room informing me someone would call me. I had gotten there at around 11:30 a.m. and took the last of the available seats, opened my book and steeled myself for a long wait.There were over 50 people in the waiting room. Mothers with children some with infants, middle age couples, young men and woman by themselves, some in work clothing -- guard uniforms, medical scrubs, fast food outfits, business suit or tie. This was not what I had expected.The Social Services department is directly on a bus route and not located in the best part of town. I am ashamed to say that I expected to find the unemployable or the lazy or the addicted or handicapped. I expected something different, something else. I expected to be surrounded by... by ""them.""I pride myself on not succumbing to prejudice so it was with a wash of embarrassment and shame that I realized that ""them"" were in fact me. The people in that waiting room could have been my neighbors or co-workers. They were people I interact with every day. One of them I recognized as an ex-employee of one of my clients who is now out of business. These were not the dregs of society looking for a handout. These were working people, just like me, who just needed some help. This was a shocking reminder of what has become of the middle class.I was the last person to sign in so as names were called, I did a mental calculation and knew I would be there for several hours. Three hours later a lightly graying woman, still younger than I, with a light but professional demeanor, showed me to a clean, well organized cubical and asked how she could help. She made conversation easy as I reluctantly explained my situation, answered her questions and presented my documentation. The forms were completed, printed and signed and the lengthiest part of the process was making copies of my documents. Because as anyone who has worked in an office knows, there is never enough paper in the copy machine and the refills are always kept on the other side of the building. An observation we both joked about.She explained what I qualified for. That I was eligible for $178 a month in SNAP benefits, the maximum for a single household, and that once I supplied a bank statement of my monthly mortgage amount she could process the paperwork. It was the one document I neglected to bring. She then told me that if there were funds still available I would most likely qualify for the state energy assistance program but would need to apply at a different state office. (The funds had already been used.) She also offered me a flyer, appropriately titled ""Help for People in Need,"" that listed contact information about 17 other programs and organizations from the United Way to school breakfasts to food banks.The following day I dropped off the mortgage information and she informed me that I would receive an EBT card in the mail within 10 working days. I thanked her for her help. She smiled almost sadly and told me that she was now seeing a lot of people like me. That it was tough out there since the crash.Even with two holidays in between, by the end of the first week in January I received the card with instructions on how to activate it online or at a bank location -- a simple matter of entering a code and selecting a PIN.I sat there staring at this gray plastic card with mixed emotions. On the one hand it was a constant reminder of my situation and on the other a relief that I would no longer need to decide whether to purchase food or medicine.It has been nearly four months now that I have been using my EBT card to purchase food. Because regardless of what you may hear you can ONLY purchase food with it. No toilet paper, no toothpaste, no cleaning or paper supplies or laundry detergent: Just food. And while I could purchase filet mignon or Alaskan crab legs or truffles I would have to do without something else to make the money last for the month.What it has let me do is purchase better quality foods. Low sodium canned products, more fruit and fresh vegetables and slightly better cuts of meat instead of just the cheapest. I still need to be frugal but I no longer need to defer a food purchase in order to fill my gas tank, pay my phone bill or buy medication.There is still a lot of stress from my financial situation but I never realized how much of it or how insidious it was to maintain the balancing act of paying bills or buying food. I have always been good at budgeting, which is why I knew I was in trouble a year before I sought help, but there is no robbing Peter to pay Paul with this. My food budget is $178 a month and while my pantry is not fully stocked I have enough to eat. And that's big; both physically and mentally.They say you can't make good decisions if you're hungry. While I never got to that, making decisions when you are worried about going hungry is just as bad. Knowing that an essential need has been met by having the SNAP benefits has allowed me to better concentrate on re-building my business, to make better decisions and not constantly worry. The relief from that alone cannot be overstated.This is a different country from the time of my parents. There were no safety nets for them. I remember the look on my mother's face when the cupboards were bare and there were seven of us to feed. I saw it in the mirror the day before I signed up for assistance. Back then, 60-year-old men devastated by the economy had no chance of starting over. While I may or may not succeed I at least have a fighting chance thanks to this benefit. This is what it looks like to be the working poor.Dennis' story is part of a Huffington Post series profiling Americans who work hard and yet still struggle to make ends meet.

The tea party, outside conservative groups and two of the right's heroes — Sarah Palin and Sen. Ted Cruz — have rallied behind Ben Sasse, the president of Midland University. For months, Sasse has been locked in an increasingly negative race with former state treasurer Shane Osborn, who has the backing of the Washington establishment and allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.In recent weeks, Sid Dinsdale, the president of Pinnacle Bank, has sought to capitalize on the Sasse-Osborn fight and produce a surprise outcome similar to Republican Sen.

""He wants to destroy it,"" says one daughter. ""He despises it,"" says the other.Outside groups and the candidates have spent millions on the race in which the GOP winner is widely expected to prevail in November in a state where Obama won just 38 percent of the vote in 2012.Trial lawyer Dave Domina faces Larry Marvin in the Democratic primary.The tea party has struggled this year as candidates have lost to establishment favorites in Texas, North Carolina and Ohio, and Nebraska stands as the insurgent movement's best remaining shot. Looking ahead to upcoming primaries, the tea party's chances to upset incumbents have been diminishing in Kentucky, Kansas, Idaho and Mississippi.The Republican establishment has a love-hate relationship with the tea party. It welcomed the movement's energy that propelled the GOP to control of the House in the 2010 elections, but it blames tea partyers for less-than-viable general election candidates in 2010 and 2012 Senate races in Indiana, Colorado, Nevada and Delaware.Republicans in the capital remain convinced they could have won control of the Senate if only their establishment candidates had won more primaries, and some in the party have been determined to defeat the movement's candidates this election."

Time to accept everyone for who they are. Time to accept the rainbow of sexuality that exists in human society 100 percent -- no ifs, ands or buts. Transgendered and queer people are not only part of the human family, but they are often among our most gifted artistically and otherwise, as they are used to seeing things in a different light. Wurst means both ""sausage"" and ""it's all the same"" in German, and stands for acceptance, according to Wurst, whose non-drag name is Tom Neuwirth: ""It's all the same how you look or where you come from, because the only thing that counts is the person you are."" While Wurst received a standing ovation, Russia's entry, two blonde twins touted as virgins, were practically booed off the stage. I felt bad for the twins, but it seemed as if a new epoch of tolerance and pro-LGBT support had dawned. Let it also be said that Conchita won fair and square: her entry ""Rise Like a Phoenix"" is a great song, head and shoulders above the tepid entries from other countries. I have to say that I, like others, have a hard time taking Eurovision seriously, but I am happy someone with guts and talent won. It is also a tribute to contemporary Austria that they nominated Wurst in the first place, shedding the nation's sometimes unfortunate associations with World War II and Kurt Waldheim-type politics. Wurst's victory was a clear victory for queer and LGBT people everywhere. But it was also a victory for humanity in its broadest sense and a rebuff not just to homophobes but to racists, anti-semites, Islamophobes and anyone else who hates another group for the sake of hatred. I will let Wurst have the last word, and quote from her eloquent victory speech: ""This night is dedicated to everyone who believes in a future of peace and freedom. You know who you are. We are unity. And we are unstoppable.""PS: Thank God that Aram Mp3, Armenia's fourth-place finisher, apologized to Wurst for his bigoted statements which are not worth repeating here. As an Armenian, he should feel doubly ashamed for having uttered such words against another persecuted minority.Videos of Wurst are available at: http://www.buzzfeed.com/kellyoakes/ways-conchita-wurst-absolutely-won-eurovision."

She is the founder of Roots Tribe Yoga, a non-profit organization that brings yoga to children and young adults within Sub Saharan Africa, thus empowering individuals to create the changes that they wish to see in their lives and in their communities.Rob: What originally motivated you to do this work, and what continues to motivate you? How, if at all, has that motivation changed over time?After serving in the US Peace Corps in The Gambia, West Africa, I knew that I wanted to continue to work in international development. I studied for my MA in International Affairs and Development at The New School, and, during a yoga teacher training course I took shortly thereafter, it struck me that yoga could be a very powerful tool for international (and individual) development. Africa, yoga, and working with children are all things I am very interested in, as well as international development. What motivates me still today is the fact that I can combine and streamline all of these interests of mine into one line of work, while being of service to--and having a significant impact on the lives of children and young adults. Is there a standout moment from your work with Roots Tribe Yoga?At the end of every class I leave time for relaxation. During this time the children lie on their backs and rest and acknowledge the work they've done by quietly connecting with themselves. During this time I always play the same song, a mantra sung by Deva Premal. On one of my last days teaching this particular group, I invited everyone to lie on their backs while I started the song. About half-way through the relaxation time some of the kids started singing along, more joined, and soon everyone was softly singing: ""May all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and that freedom for all."" What did you know about the population you are working with before you began teaching? What were some of the assumptions you had about this population and how have those assumptions changed?I had had more than two years of experience working with children in Africa from my service in the Peace Corps. Children are children no matter where in the world they happen to be. An assumption I used to harbor was that certain concepts, such as interconnectedness or mindfulness, were too lofty or complex for young people to grasp. I've learned, however, that it's simply a matter of how the concept is presented. Frequently I see children picking up on these notions quite naturally, because it is natural. All that is needed is someone or something to foster and value these ideas; to allow them to evolve as the child grows into an adult.  What are two distinct ways that your teaching style differs from the way you might teach in a studio, and what are the reasons for these differences?I find that teaching adults in a studio class is a relatively predictable experience; you can have a plan, or an idea of what you would like to teach, and carry out that plan without extreme amounts of fluctuation. With children, however, you never really know what might happen, and its best to be prepared to forget your plans entirely and devise a whole new plan on the spot, depending on what the group needs. Spontaneity and creativity are essential to working with children.   What has been the greatest challenge in your teaching experience and what tools have you developed for addressing that challenge?I find the language barrier to be difficult. However, it is a challenge that I find intriguing and rewarding as it compels me to constantly discover new ways of delivering what I want to communicate. For example, from learning to speak Wolof (a West African tribal language) I came to realize that much of the yoga jargon, and the way I articulate certain concepts and instructions, are abstract and not easily translated into tribal languages which tend to be more concrete in diction. Hence, when working with children who's first language is not English, I try not only to tailor my explanations, but also to create ways in which the class may embody and experience the themes first-hand. Certain group poses, for instance, are a good way to demonstrate that each person plays a significant role, as everyone must work together--sometimes literally leaning upon one another--in order to achieve the pose. What advice would you give to anyone who is going to teach in the population you work with?   The best advice I could give to someone working with a similar population is keep a sense of humor. Of course, the end goal remains in sight, and it is important, but when you become too fixated on attaining the goal--on the outcome of the practice, rather than on the practice itself--the magic of the yoga disappears. When this happens, the benefits of the practice decrease dramatically. Working with children, and working in Africa, both take a fair amount of patience simply because plans often unfold in a way that is utterly unexpected. Learning to cope with this is in itself a practice--it is the practice. It means learning non-attachment, and working with what you have been given, rather than what you expected. It may be 100 children when you expected only 20, it may be a soccer field to practice on as opposed to a cleared out classroom, there may be no translator, and so on, the possibilities are endless. This is yoga--it is the kind of practice that starts on the mat, and soon leaks out into life--and it all begins with keeping a sense of humor. What are some of your ideas about, or hopes for, the future of yoga in South Africa in the next decade?Yoga offers an enormous array of benefits such as: individual empowerment, physical and emotional health, heightened self awareness, increased mindfulness, and a plethora of educational benefits--too many to list here. My hope, therefore, is that yoga will continue to spread beyond the major cities, and into the far reaches of the rest of the population, including every interested person of the townships, suburbs, and rural areas. Moreover, I hope that yoga will bring a deeper sense of unity to the people of South Africa, Africa, and the world at large. How has this work changed your definition of service? Your definition of yoga? Your practice?This work has made me realize that, for me, service, yoga, and practice, are all closely intertwined. People often define yoga as asanas or physical exercise, but there are many forms of yoga that can be practiced both on and off the mat. My definitions have changed in that I no longer see them as separate notions: the work is my yoga, the yoga is my work, and all of it is done in service to others, including myself, and, ideally, everyone I come into contact with.Editor: Alice TrembourStay connected with Give Back Yoga Foundation as we share the gift of yoga with the world, one person at a time, by following us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ and by subscribing to our newsletter.
