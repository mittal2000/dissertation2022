As a whole, animals are largely a promiscuous group, with only a very select species choosing to mate with only one partner over a lifetime. As a matter of fact, more than 90 percent of the animal kingdom mates with multiple partners. Most animals do not actually choose one mate for a long time — or even a short time, for that matter. Most animals just mate with each other and move on.  Some interesting ones to note: Bees, for example. Queen bees can mate with anywhere from one to more than 40 partners. Worker bees actually prefer a more promiscuous queen. And by mating with so many partners, the queen increases the genetic diversity of her offspring. (This is one of the main reasons that animals choose multiple partners to begin with.) Oddly enough, after a male bee mates with the queen, he dies.  Another promiscuous animal is the bonobo chimpanzee, which mates in all sorts of positions, with multiple partners, both male and female. Bonobo chimpanzees are famous for the frequency of their mating, as well as the many creative ways in which they do the deed.  But there are a few animals that mate with each other for life, or at least a very long time. One such animal is the wolf, with a typical wolf pack consisting of a father, a mother, and their young, similar to a human family.  Others on the short list of animals that are (mostly) monogamous: Swans, black vultures, prairie voles, termites, turtle doves, and a parasitic worm with a name that I can’t spell or pronounce.  So do the animals that choose a lifelong partner ever say sayonara to that mate? It seems that they do. Just last year, in the Reptilian Zoo Happ in Austria, the world’s oldest married animal couple, a pair of giant tortoises, started fighting with each other – 115 years after their first date! Now some of you might be saying, ""It’s about time!"" but scientists told zoo staff that animals splitting up after that long of a union is rare.  How did they know something was up? The female tortoise began attacking the male tortoise for no apparent reason (no surprise there). They have since been split up into different habitats, and last I checked the zoo staff was hoping for reconciliation (since tortoises can live up to 150 years). One trick they tried to get them back together was to get another female tortoise to live with Poldi (the male) to make Bibi (the female) jealous. No dice though. She didn’t seem to care all that much.  Another species that typically mates for life is the gibbon, which forms very strong pair bonds. These animals often spend much of their time together, grooming each other, and hanging out in the trees. Alas, recent gibbon research has shown that the home life of these primates is not as idyllic as it seems, with mates occasionally cheating on each other.  So there you have it folks, animals can indeed get divorced, though not many animals get ""married"" to one partner in the first place. Except for a few species, monogamy — and divorce — is mostly a human thing."

""Can I help you?"" asks this green-shirted store employee with a New York-flavored voice. I tell him what I'm looking for and he takes me over and shows me the one model they carry. It's nice but very expensive. ""Do you have any other models costing less?"" ""We used to, but now this is the only one we carry."" ""Where are you from?"" I ask. ""Originally Cuba, but I've lived here most of my life."" He goes to his car to get me his business card and I tell him I'm a photographer, which turns out to be like opening a long-sealed flood gate. He tells me how he used to have a photography business, and talks about the equipment he still has -- cameras, lights and more, and how he used to spool his own film, and the love he had for photography, that I can hear in his voice is still there. By now he's followed me outside the store, where our conversation continues. ""So what happened? Why aren't you still doing it?"" I ask. ""Well, I'm taking care of my wife, who's not doing so well..."" ""And?"" I say, sensing there's more. ""Years ago I was in business with a partner. Then I got sick and was laid up for over a year. When I came back, he had screwed me over, and after that, I got a bad taste in my mouth for it."" But to me, the way he's speaking about it, so lovingly and longingly, and about all the equipment he still has, gives me a different sense than what he's saying. I don't feel as though I'm talking with Luis the medical supply store employee, but instead, more as though I'm speaking with Luis, a fellow photographer, and inside I just know it would be a great blessing if he were to pick up his camera and reconnect with his passion. The final sign for now is that when I ask to make a photograph with him, without my saying a word he positions himself perfectly in relation to me so that the warm glow of the late afternoon sun bathes his face with radiance.info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.com"

Live on January 8, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

She realized that she wanted to be healthier for her son -- to be a more active mom and to make sure she had healthy habits that her son could copy as he grew up. But she knew that diets hadn't been working for her, so she wasn't sure how to start.""I'm a real girl -- I love to eat and indulge in the things I love to have,"" Hudson said.She knew enough about herself to know that a diet that deprived her of her favorite foods wasn't going to work for her. Hudson compared a restrictive diet to holding your breath. ""Eventually you're going to be gasping for air,"" she said. Similarly, in a diet, ""eventually you're going to break, and then overindulge.""She said she decided to try out Weight Watchers for just one week, because she had heard that it was easier to follow and wouldn't make her cut her favorite things out of her diet. Over the next couple years, she dropped 80 pounds and became a spokesperson for the company.""It taught me how to eat, how to measure my portions, and know what I was putting in my body,"" she said of the program. She said that throughout the program she kept herself accountable, even though she had realistic expectations. For example, immediately after you give birth, it might be unlikely that you'll get right up and work out, but you can start to pay attention to what you're eating.""Take baby steps, and let it work for you,"" she said. ""Think 'I can't run, but I can walk.'""She found her motivation in her desire to be the best possible mom for her son. ""Your baby's going to eat what you're going to eat,"" she said.Not only did she lose the weight, she's kept it off for the three years since. ""It's just as hard to maintain it as it is to lose weight,"" she said. She's continued as a spokesperson for the company, and wrote a book about her weight loss venture, titled I Got This.Now, Hudson's channeling her success into another venture, working with Weight Watchers as they award a Healthy Communities Grant to Baltimore residents. The grant will provide weight loss support to locals with a body mass index over 25 who also receives and assistance from the local, state or federal government. Hudson will serve as a mentor to new mothers who are trying to get healthy.Around 36 percent of Baltimore's population is obese, even higher than the country's average. Furthermore, while recent data suggests a plateau in American obesity levels, research has shown that obesity and the diseases that come with it are still growing in lower-income communities, according to a recent study from Harvard University.""It's pretty parallel to my story and my journey,"" Hudson said. She understands the women's struggles, having grown up without access to healthy foods and habits.""Often as a new mom, people can feel overwhelmed and they can feel alone,"" said Karen Miller-Kovach, chief scientific officer for Weight Watchers. She stressed, however, that it's important to start thinking about getting healthy early. ""The motivation to get the baby weight off after a year is a little less -- you're used to it,"" she said. But it's perfectly healthy for new moms to start losing weight, and Miller-Kovach said that two pounds a week is healthy for non-breastfeeding moms, while breast-feeding moms should aim for a pound a week.""There's a belief that to eat healthily requires a lot more money, but many people don't know how to make use of the lower-cost things that are available,"" said Miller-Kovach. She suggested learning to cook simple, low-cost, healthy meals as a viable skill participants might take away from the program.Hudson said that through her weight-loss journey, she's learned ""anything can be good for you and anything can be bad for you."" Due to her busy schedule, Hudson said she sometimes finds herself in a situation without healthy options, and she's learned how to make the best of it. If the only food available is a hamburger, she makes sure to control her portion size.""It's about making the smartest decision and the right decision,"" she said. ""Outsmart food, don't let it outsmart you.""More from Everyday Health: The Mediterranean Diet Wins Against Peripheral Arterial Disease The Fast Food Meal Cameron Diaz Ate Every Day for 3 Years 8 Subtle Signs Your Child Is DepressedJennifer Hudson's Weight Loss Secrets originally appeared on Everyday Health"
