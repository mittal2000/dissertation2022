0,SPORTS,Banning Sepp Blatter May Finally Give FIFA The Chance To Reform Itself. But Does It Want To?,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sepp-blatter-ban-fifa-corruption_us_567abf96e4b0b958f658d3e8,"FIFA ""proved incapable"" of making real change when Blatter was in charge.",2015-12-23,"FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a press conference in July. On Monday, the FIFA ethics committee suspended Blatter and Michel Platini, the head of European soccer, for eight years for their roles in an improper payment.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567ac081190000e50078a93f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FIFA gave soccer fans around the world an early holiday present on Monday when it banned Sepp Blatter, the organization's president, and Michel Platini, the head of the European soccer federation, from the sport for eight years due to internal ethics violations.Blatter approved a $2 million payment to Platini that FIFA's ethics committee deemed improper. The long-term bans followed provisional suspensions issued in October.Compared to the larger corruption charges facing global soccer officials and others affiliated with the sport, Blatter and Platini's actions may seem relatively minor. And as plenty of observers have noted, removing two of soccer's most powerful men won't be enough to address the broader issues plaguing global soccer's governing body and its federations and the deep-rooted corruption in FIFA's core structure.""This would have been unthinkable a year ago, so you can't really overstate the magnitude of what has happened symbolically,"" said Roger Pielke Jr., a professor and sports governance expert at the University of Colorado. ""But in terms of the nuts and bolts of FIFA reform, it isn't a big deal. Because what needs to happen to improve FIFA governance is far more than getting a new president.""“Sepp Blatter,” he added, “was always beside the point.”Symbolism aside, however, what the bans could also do is remove two top officials who perpetuated FIFA's status quo and make room for a new vision. When Blatter was still standing and Platini, once considered the favorite to ascend to the presidency, was potentially poised to take over, it was unclear whether proposals to eliminate corrupt practices within the sport would ever be ambitious enough.In announcing his resignation, Blatter himself unveiled a series of proposed reforms that he said would reshape FIFA amid the corruption probes that have ensnared top soccer officials -- most of whom are from CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean, and CONMEBOL, the South American body. (The attorney general of Switzerland, where FIFA is based, is also investigating whether corruption influenced the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively.)But Blatter and Platini's removal opens the door to true reform -- if that is actually something FIFA wants. The organization's next president or reform-minded officials within FIFA, if there are any, have the chance to tackle actual governance issues that have fostered abuses in global soccer, including the lack of both outside oversight and internal controls that could theoretically provide an incentive for preventing corruption.“The rot that is inside FIFA is pretty endemic,” Pielke said. “One of the worst situations would be for FIFA to put a Band-Aid or two on its wounds and try to limp forward without engaging in reform, because we could find ourselves in this position with the next guy.”Corruption in global soccer has already caused major damage, raising questions not only about how future World Cup hosts are determined, but also about past events like the 2006 World Cup in Germany. And, as organizations that have challenged FIFA's practices have noted, if corruption helped drive the World Cup to Qatar, it also contributed to the massive human rights abuses that the country has yet to address.Repairing the structures of soccer to eliminate most, if not all, of the corruption in the sport may not be easy, since FIFA comprises 209 national federations and six regional confederations that manage lucrative events across the world. But the United States and Switzerland, which are conducting the most widespread investigations into FIFA, seem hell-bent on rooting out the people and practices they've uncovered thus far.""The message from this announcement should be clear to every culpable individual who remains in the shadows, hoping to evade our investigation: You will not wait us out. You will not escape our focus,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in announcing a second round of indictments earlier this month.Outside governance organizations have also laid out plans for reshaping FIFA and its federations in a way that will improve its practices and limit, if not eliminate, corruption. For example, a coalition that includes the global anti-corruption organization Transparency International has called for a series of changes led by an independent reform commission.Pielke, meanwhile, suggests some sensible ways to reshape the organization, such as closely regulating FIFA as a business or enlisting the help of national governments to improve its governance standards.With Blatter and Platini in such influential roles, FIFA ""proved incapable of reforming itself,"" Pielke said. The question is whether FIFA can now commit itself to real change, whether it's initiated from outside or within.“The challenge for FIFA is not so much knowing what needs to be done, it's doing it,” Pielke said. “It's not rocket science. It really isn't.” Also on HuffPost:"

4,BLACK VOICES,Grand Jury Could Still Snare Trooper Who Arrested Sandra Bland,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandra-bland-brian-encinia-grand-jury_us_567ac7e2e4b0b958f658dba3,Bland's family is calling for a federal prosecution.,2015-12-23,"Texas state trooper Brian Encinia points a Taser, in this still image captured from the police dash camera video from the traffic stop of Sandra Bland's vehicle in Prairie View, Texas on July 10, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58616e3f1500002300915efa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"​A Texas grand jury next month may consider whether the state trooper who threatened Sandra Bland with a stun gun during a routine traffic stop last July should face charges related to the incident.After the same grand jury chose this week not to indict any officials from the sheriff's department or county jail where Bland died, her family's attorney, Cannon Lambert, called on federal prosecutors Tuesday to seek charges against the trooper.The special prosecutor handling the case said that trooper Brian Encinia's conduct during the violent altercation could be the focus of the grand jury when it meets again next month. Encinia, who is white, was filmed on his patrol car's dashcam threatening Bland, an African American, with a stun gun during her arrest on July 10.Bland's family and supporters called Tuesday for federal charges against Encinia. A lawyer for Bland's family told The New York Times that federal prosecutors should launch a case against Encinia because he used excessive force and had no reason to arrest Bland in the first place. Lambert told the Associated Press he plans to file a motion to force Texas authorities to hand over a report by the Texas Rangers into Bland's death.Protesters have vowed to stage demonstrations until the grand jury reconvenes, according to NBC News.Bland was found dead on July 13 in her cell after her arrest. A medical examiner ruled the 28-year-old's death a suicide, and grand jurors announced Monday that no law enforcement officials had committed a crime while Bland was in custody. Bland's family has maintained that they do not believe her death was a suicide, and filed a federal lawsuit in August over Bland's arrest and incarceration. The 52-minute video of Bland's arrest was a major factor in making her story one of the biggest law enforcement scandals in a year filled with policing controversies. Outrage over Bland's case fed into the Black Lives Matter movement and popularized the use of #SayHerName as a rallying cry for women mistreated by police. Encinia arrested Bland for allegedly assaulting him during the traffic stop. In the video, he is seen brandishing a stun gun, yelling ""I will light you up"" after she refused to put out a cigarette and get out of her car, and reaching in through the driver's side door. At another point, she and Encinia are out of camera frame, but she can be heard complaining that the trooper had slammed her head and is ""about to break my wrist.""Bland, who lived in a Chicago suburb, had just completed a job interview at Prairie State A&M University, her alma mater, before being pulled over by Encinia. Soon after the video was released, the Texas Department of Public Safety said that Encinia violated ""procedures regarding traffic stops and the department’s courtesy policy."" Encinia was put on administrative duty in July."

Kansas didn't release those documents to the public until the law was changed last year, with lobbying help from the Hartes.When they read the flimsy evidence that had prompted the botched raid, the Hartes were outraged.The initial tipoff to police had come in 2011, when a Missouri state trooper witnessed Robert Harte exiting a gardening store with a bag of supplies. Many such businesses in Kansas and Missouri were staked out over 2011 and 2012 as part of a controversial anti-drug effort called ""Operation Constant Gardener.""Police then worked to gather more evidence against the Hartes, and months after the initial tip, they believed they'd found it hiding at the bottom of the family's trash.

One deputy would state that based on his experience, it looked as though the substance had been processed through the ""extraction of ...

Police conducted a field test on the material, and shortly after it tested positive for marijuana, the raid was green-lighted.But field testing for drugs is notoriously unreliable.In their lawsuit, the Hartes argued that using dubious drug tests to build upon a single additional piece of dubious evidence -- a trip to a garden store, no less -- shouldn't be enough to launch a police raid. But a federal judge ruled last Friday that no constitutional violations had occurred and the officers had sufficient probable cause for the search.The judge was apparently not moved by the Hartes' argument that field drug tests are notoriously unreliable and that field testing the substance found in their trash -- tea leaves, according to the Hartes -- would have been even less likely to produce accurate results.""The deputy did not acknowledge in the affidavit that the field tests are not to be used with saturated or liquid samples and that the 'false positive' rate of the test used is 70 percent,"" the Hartes' complaint read.

The Johnson County sheriff's office now requires lab confirmation of suspected drug material, so perhaps there's one small victory to come out of the Hartes' misfortune.The Hartes also argued that police displayed ""excessive"" force during the raid, opting to use a ""heavily armed SWAT-type team"" and even accusing their son, then 13, of having a ""drug problem."" But the judge found that the officers had conducted themselves in a lawful and reasonable manner.The Hartes were seeking $5 million in compensatory damages and $2 million in punitive damages for violations of their Fourth and 14th Amendment rights.The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution states that search warrants may be issued only ""upon probable cause."" Over at Reason, Jacob Sullum neatly sums up why probable cause often rests on improbable evidence:[T]he Supreme Court has said it need amount to no more than a ""substantial chance"" or a ""fair probability"" that evidence of a crime will be discovered. It's clear that a probability substantially lower than 50 percent will do, which is why courts continue to treat highly unreliable indicators such as drug field tests and dog alerts as sufficient to justify a search.The Hartes' case also offers another sad commentary on the ineffectiveness of the drug war.

The eight guests sat for two hours over a hodgepodge meal that included homemade hearty tomato soup, fresh popcorn and chocolate-dipped strawberries to tell stories and glean wisdom from the one thing each had in common. Strangers just months ago before the monthly meals again, they had come together to support each other in a way few others in their lives could.During a time of the year full of diverse family reunions and Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's traditions, these city transplants each had experienced a painful family death in recent years. Many were like 26-year-old Riffkin, whose 53-year-old father Matthew suddenly died a year ago from a heart condition. The foods that evening were favorites of their loved ones. The tales shared were of holiday traditions, like Riffkin’s of bargain shopping for a Christmas tree each year with her father and sister on the night of Christmas Eve before coming home to decorate it. Some conversations turned to strategizing what to do this time of year without their loved ones.“We can be vulnerable on grief and loss,” said Riffkin, who works as a writer at the Gallup polling organization and is spending Christmas with her mother and sister at home in Salt Lake City. She hosts the meals as part of The Dinner Party, a network of young people who have experienced death and come together over food in more than 50 cities cities from Anchorage to Sydney. “The people at my table know me better than some coworkers and friends,” Riffkin said.As the season peaks this week with family get-togethers, vacations, parties and New Year's celebrations, it’s a time of joy for many. For those whose loved ones have died, it can also be a painful reminder.The holiday time is “the moment when the world reminds us that we should be curled up with the ones we love. It’s when the onslaught of emails hits our inbox reminding us to buy a present for Mom,” said Carla Fernandez, 27, who launched The Dinner Party two years ago in Los Angeles with her friends, Lennon Flowers and Dara Kosberg, after her dad’s death.“It’s when water cooler conversation at the office focuses on who we’re heading home to, and when the streets empty because most of us are kicking back with people we love. If one of your core people isn’t around, that empty place by the fire, or the phone number that won’t connect you anymore, becomes hard to ignore.”The group is just one community addressing and thinking of what is for some the best times of year and, for others, the worst. In recent years, a host of resources and communities have come together online and offline around grief during the holidays. During a time of tradition, these Americans are forming new ones and rethinking old ones.“Honestly, this time of year, the phone rings off the hook with emergencies and tragedies,” said the Rev. Nancy Taylor, senior minister of Old South Church in Boston.Last week, the congregation held a Blue Christmas Service, following an Advent tradition of prayer on the longest night of the year, when many churches observe the lives of those who have departed or are suffering.It was “a reminder that the season is not all festive reds and greens. Blue, too, is a true color of the season,” said Taylor. “We sang carols in bluesy, jazzy tones. We prayed our sad prayers and wrapped an aching earth in all the hope and love we could muster. We lit our four Advent candles to pierce the world’s darkness with brave flames of peace, hope, joy and love. We gave thanks to God for coming into the world as it is, imperfect and bruised.”For grief counselors, too, the holidays are a busy season.“I see more people raw than any other time this time of year,” said David Kessler, who runs HolidayGrief.com and is the co-author of You Can Heal Your Heart: Finding Peace After a Breakup, Divorce, or Death. “I tell them there’s no right way to handle it. Your loved one’s life was unique, their death is unique, so grief will be unique.”Kessler noted that while there’s a popular view that more people die during the holidays, it’s actually a myth with roots in grief and the longer nights of cold and darkness. “Death is more prevalent in our psyche this time of year. A loved one that dies around the holidays can send a bigger shock wave.”That’s been much of the focus recently for Litsa Williams, a clinical social worker in Baltimore who is the co-founder and program director of “What’s Your Grief?” a three-year-old website that’s seen an uptick in visitors this month. “We have very specific ideas of what holidays should look like,"" said Williams, 35, whose father died when she was 19. ""Some are just from our culture or media, others are from our real experiences. But it’s different when people realize their holidays don’t look like that anymore,” On What's Your Grief, the current top article is titled, “10 Times Grief Made You Cry This Holiday Season.” No. 5: “When you heard their least favorite holiday song.” No. 7: “When you found a gift they would have loved.”“It’s not going to be the same. How do we get into that? What are we going to do?,” said Williams, echoing some of the questions addressed on her latest podcast with website co-founder Eleanor Haley.In Salt Lake City, where Riffkin will see her mom and younger sister for Christmas, she’ll attempt continuing family traditions without her dad.“I tried to go buy a tree this year without him, but was really nervous,” said Riffkin, who said she’ll try again with her sister to “carry the torch” and bargain hunt, hoping to score a fir for less than $20. “We’d always kick Dad out of the house and do a cookie exchange party, just for the girls and my mom’s friends. It will be different this year, but we’re going to try. We’ll do our best.”Also on HuffPost:"

Credit Downgrades, Economic Woes",Scott Conroy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-chris-christie_us_56798cc3e4b06fa6887edb0d,"“I’m a reform-minded conservative that got to do big things. He didn’t,” Bush said.",2015-12-22,"Presidential candidate Jeb Bush shops at Zeb's General Store in North Conway, New Hampshire. He thinks his mom will like her Christmas present this year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56798e601600000001eb970d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NORTH CONWAY, N.H. -- For the first time in the 2016 campaign, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) set his sights directly on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), criticizing Christie's economic record in an interview with The Huffington Post on Tuesday.Asked to explain to New Hampshire primary voters how he's different from the New Jersey governor, Bush noted that Christie is “a great guy” and a friend before he panned New Jersey's economy.“I would say it's the record of accomplishment -- my record in Florida compared to his,” Bush said. “When people look at it, I'm a reform-minded conservative that got to do big things. He didn't. He hasn't. We were AAA bond rated. He's had credit downgrades. We led the nation in job growth. New Jersey hasn't done as well.”Two days before Bush made his remarks, Christie had challenged his GOP rivals to “bring it on,” citing economic successes in his state after years of lagging job growth and multiple bond rating downgrades. “With a Democratic controlled legislature fighting him every step of the way, not only has Governor Christie been a leader in securing landmark reforms to the pension, tenure and bail systems, but New Jersey just reported the strongest private sector job growth the state has seen in 15 years with the unemployment dropping nearly in half since Christie came into office to 5.3%,"" Christie spokeswoman Samantha Smith said in a statement. ""We’ll defend that record any day of the week.""With their similar bases of support, Bush and Christie appear to be on a collision course before New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary. Both candidates are relying on especially strong showings in the state to propel them back into contention nationally.Christie is locked in a five-way battle for second place with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) and Bush -- who all trail front-runner Donald Trump by a wide margin. Yet Christie's poll numbers here have been trending upward recently, and he recently locked up several endorsements from major local Republican players, as well as the New Hampshire Union-Leader, the state’s largest newspaper.Meanwhile, Bush announced over the weekend that he'd received the support of influential New Hampshire GOP activist Beverly Bruce.As the former Florida governor touts his own executive experience, he appears to be entering a new stage in his campaign, when efforts to contrast his own record with Christie's will become more overt. “In a difficult legislature, of course,” Bush said of the Democratic legislative majority in New Jersey. “But I can point to a record of accomplishment that's unmatched by anyone on that stage.”Bush spoke with HuffPost after completing some last-minute Christmas shopping at Zeb’s General Store -- a whimsical tourist shop that's a favorite presidential candidate haunt in this northern hamlet. Among the candidate's purchases was a bottle of “Slap Your Mama” brand hot sauce, which he bought as a gift for his 90-year-old mother.“This, without the pearls, looks like Barbara Bush,” he said of the matronly character who appears on the hot sauce brand's label. “This will be funny in the Bush family in Houston, Texas.”Asked if the former first lady would appreciate the joke as much as the rest of the family, Bush admitted that he was “taking a risk” but expected she would like the cheeky Christmas present. “If she doesn't, I won't be there to see,” he added.Video produced by Ben Teitelbaum.This article was updated after publication with a comment from the Christie campaign."
12,POLITICS,GOP Lawmaker Says Armed Citizens Should 'Clean Our Society Of Scum Bags',Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bob-gannon-guns_us_56799343e4b014efe0d6fd24,"Democrats say he's calling for a ""vigilante uprising.""",2015-12-22,1981: The Attempted Assassination Of President Ronald Reagan,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a8abe1200002d00ad7981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Following a shooting at a local shopping mall in Madison, Wisconsin, a state lawmaker is calling for citizens to arm themselves and ""clean our society of these scum bags.""Republican state Rep. Bob Gannon issued the blistering statement on Monday, in the wake of Saturday's East Towne Mall shooting that police say began as an argument between a group of teenagers but ended with gunfire and one of those teenagers left wounded. He argues that more armed citizens with concealed carry weapons and fewer public places that ban carrying firearms, like the shopping mall, would create a safer environment. ""Wisconsin does not have a death penalty law, but with significant practice and careful aim, law abiding citizens can help clean our society of these scum bags,"" Gannon said in a statement. The Republican went on to say that he believes because criminals no longer have ""any fear of our courts and prisons,"" it's time that armed citizens ""stand up and fight back"" by being ""fully prepared to shoot center mass."" ""Center mass"" is law enforcement language for the trunk of the human body, which when shot is likely to produce lethal wounds because of the multiple vital organs and systems running through it. Essentially, Gannon is calling for citizens to be prepared to shoot to kill.He also said that he refuses to shop at any business that bars him from carrying a weapon.State Democrats blasted Gannon's statement, saying what he was calling for amounted to a ""vigilante uprising.""""I am appalled by the dangerous rhetoric Representative Gannon chose to use in his press release,"" state Rep. Chris Taylor (D) said in a statement Monday. ""Representative Gannon is living in a James Bond dream world. If more guns made us safer, we would be the safest country in the world.""State Rep. Jonathan Brostoff (D), who called Gannon's statement ""a terrible idea,"" told local Fox affiliate WITI that public spaces, like malls, would be safer if a universal background check law was in place. ""This is just another example of my Republican colleagues being more scared of the NRA than of mass shootings, unfortunately,"" Brostoff said.When asked by WITI if he'd gone too far with his statement, Gannon pushed back, saying that what he's describing is not vigilantism but self-defense.“Representative Gannon should recognize that it is possible to keep our communities safe while respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,"" Taylor said, adding that she's personally relieved that the lawmaker refuses to shop at retailers that ban firearms. ""I think we’re all a little bit safer because of it,"" Taylor said."

But there were other individuals who deserve some time in the spotlight. For example, model Maria Borges opting out of wearing super-long hair extensions to rock her natural hair at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

The youngest (and arguably most famous) Jenner debuted the Kylie Lip Kit line this November, and the products sold out unsurprisingly. But that wasn't the only lipstick to sell out super fast.

And we have to acknowledge singer-actress-style icon Zoë Kravitz, who walked in Alexander Wang's finale Balenciaga show with her waist-long box braids. Social Media Campaigns Prove It's Time To Change Beauty StandardsThanks to Twitter and Instagram, anyone with a message had platforms to make an impact. Amy Schumer used her candid humor to produce a ""Girl, You Don’t Need Makeup"" parody which reminded women that they are beautiful without makeup. The powerful movement took off thanks to a hash tag with the same name, and it even encouraged men to bare their faces in support. Meanwhile, YouTube star NikkieTutorials' #ThePowerofMakeup campaign reassured us all that there is absolutely no shame in getting glammed up either. Beauty brand Dove continued it's #LoveYourCurls mission by launching an emoji keyboard complete with 27 curly hair designs that represent various skin tones and hair colors. FINALLY!Hair Color Got Trippy We said bye-bye to ombré and hey, what's up, to a new hair color trend: tortoiseshell hair. Bronde, a natural-looking dye job, was a favorite among celebs like Gisele Bündchen and Blake Lively. Instead of a clear contrast from root to tip, the tortoiseshell look combines warm colors like golden blonde and chocolates to form a beautiful combination of hues. Holographic hair came in the form of a new technique called ""hand-pressed color,"" which uses sheets of glass and large brushes to create. Check out colorist Chiala Marvici's very cool process here.On the other end of the spectrum, guys were embracing the Manic Panic-like colors that we thought were a thing of the past.

Popular black hairstyles like bantu knots and the Afro were showcased in mainstream media, leading many to believe that these ""trends"" were new to 2015. Just to name a few instances, baby hair was a ""wild"" new trend, according to Elle UK and now defunct Lucky Magazine.
