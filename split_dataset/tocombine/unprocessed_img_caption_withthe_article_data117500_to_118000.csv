The winner would avoid a likely second-round matchup against Brazil. With the Selecao looming, the Netherlands defeated Chile, 2-0, at Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo on Monday to win Group B. The match was scoreless deep into the second half as both teams were without key players. Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli held midfielder Arturo Vidal out of the lineup and the Netherlands were without striker Robin Van Persie due to suspension. As those dynamic players watched, it was a pair of reserves called on by Dutch coach Luis van Gaal who made the difference.

While the secretary gushed about his department's accomplishments for LGBTI people and reminded us to be active instead of alarmed at the growing global anti-LGBTI trend, the embassies he leads were turning down visas for LGBTI Africans to attend San Francisco Pride 2014, whose theme is ""Color Our World With Pride.""Kerry said that he joins the world in celebrating Pride Month and ""reaffirms its commitment to the promotion and protection of the human rights of LGBT persons around the globe.""And yet the State Department was not willing to support the LGBTI visa applicants whom I'd invited to march with me in my San Francisco Pride community grand marshal contingent. The State Department denied seven people a platform to speak about the persecution in their countries, presumably for fear that they might not return home to the countries that persecute them. And after they were denied, a clear pattern emerged, and I pulled 11 of the remaining 14 applicants.While the Obama administration and this secretary of state have supported the LGBT movement like none before, there is no excuse for this flagrant snub and the homophobic attitude expressed by some of the consular officials who did the interviewing. The State Department has refused to allow the African LGBTI community to participate in one of the most significant LGBTI events in the world. Thus the U.S. is exacerbating their victimization by extending the domestic persecution of these LGBTI persons into the global arena. Recently President Obama announced blacklist measures against Ugandans who persecuted LGBTI persons. It seems, in effect, that by denying these Pride visas, we may as well have added the victims of the persecution to the blacklist too.Thirty-four countries in Africa penalize homosexuality, with life imprisonment or even capital punishment for some. In this past year draconian penal codes have given way to harsher anti-LGBTI legislation in Uganda and Nigeria. We have not done enough to directly assist the criminalized LGBTI community members who have been directly impacted by state-sanctioned homophobia and transphobia, many of whom need urgent humanitarian assistance. Members of these communities should be permitted to come to the United States to bear witness, especially those whose voices are silenced by countries that criminalize so-called ""promotion"" of homosexuality.""No matter where you are, no matter who you love, we stand with you,"" noted Kerry in that Pride-affirming speech. ""And that's what pride means, and that's what drives us today.""And he further assured, ""The journey isn't complete. The march isn't over. The promise isn't perfected. But we will march on together.""The consular officials, working under the leadership of Secretary Kerry, have failed to abide by this promise, doing the exact opposite, rendering his words mere lip service. No, Mr. Secretary, it seems that in fact we are not marching together. You have denied us all that privilege."

7,POLITICS,Why Conservatives Should Want to End the Drug War,"James Carli, ContributorDrug Policy and Sustainability Consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-drug-policy_b_5523116.html,Drug policy reform is an issue that conservatives should rally behind. There are three overwhelming and compelling reasons why this is so.,2014-06-23,"A police officer and his dog stand guard by seized marijuana at the Baja California state police headquarters in Tijuana, Mexico, Monday Nov. 1, 2010. According to state police, 12,976 kilograms (28,606 pounds) of marijuana were seized and one person arrested in an operation early Monday. (AP Photo/Guillermo Arias)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cddb2100002501c9622d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The issue of drug policy reform is well-understood among commentators and activists on the left. The stark facts that drug use is roughly equal among all racial groups yet brown and black people bear the brunt of drug law arrests and incarceration is a glaring violation of civil rights and social justice, two buzzwords common among the progressive set.  But drug policy reform is also a very conservative issue, and an issue that conservatives should rally behind. There are three overwhelming and compelling reasons why this is so.  1: Economics. First and foremost, to fight the war on drugs, U.S. government bureaucrats, in all of their infinite wisdom, have thrown literally a trillion (trillion, with a T) dollars of taxpayer money at the issue over the last 40 years, and have had no productive or demonstrable benefits as a result. Drugs are still easily available, cheap, and potent, levels of drug production worldwide have arguably not decreased, and nothing of value has been created. There have been no conventional measures of success achieved, yet drug war zealots at the DEA and some within the halls of Congress seem to think that if we only threw just a few more (millions? billions?) of your tax dollars at the problem that maybe we might actually achieve the dream of a ""drug-free world."" But this has proven out of reach, for there has always been, for the history of humanity, and will more than likely always remain until the end of time, the desire to achieve altered perception. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, the desire to experience altered perception may be as innate and natural of a human drive as the sex drive or even hunger. Throwing taxpayer money at fighting a natural urge makes as much sense as when Victorian England persecuted people for masturbating (spoiler: it didn't work). Where there is a demand, there will be a supply, and no amount of taxpayer-funded intervention can dissuade, subvert, or otherwise halt these fundamental laws of economics.  2. Liberty. The notion that the state can deprive you of your freedom because of personal choices you make about your body has no place in a free society. It is a slippery slope, for if the state can knock down your door to take your drugs, what is to stop them from knocking down your door to take your guns, or to put you in a cage for expressing a contrarian opinion? People who choose to use drugs arrive at that decision for an infinitely wide spectrum of reasons, and nobody on earth (especially government bureaucrats) can possibly understand the factors in your life that make you want to achieve an altered state. Some people use drugs when they feel good, some to help them manage stress. Some people use drugs to help them wake up in the morning, and some to help them get to sleep at night. Some people use drugs and have no problem with them, and some people use drugs and get addicted. All of these points are health and psychological issues, so having the state step in to judge you as a criminal because of how you address variables in your life that only you understand is a fundamental violation of our liberty and principles as a free society.  3. Community and family values. You know what's best for you, your family, and your community. When there is disharmony in your home, you need to do what is best to address the problem. What you don't need is some outsider interfering and telling you what the problem is, how to fix it, and possibly sending someone from your home to jail for a long time, just because he or she is from ""the government."" That does not fix the disharmony. In fact it sews even more discord, and breeds an unhealthy and destructive resentment for the authority which interfered. The criminalization of drug use has waged immeasurable harm to the fundamental fabric of families and communities, harm which has the result of increasing community distrust and engendering an environment more susceptible to crime, poverty, and despair.  A number of prominent conservative thinkers and leaders share this assessment of the failure of the war on drugs, including, but not limited to, Milton Friedman, William Buckley, Grover Norquist, George Shultz, Frank Carlucci, and Rand Paul. Furthermore, faith leaders and clergy are now starting to come out in support of ending the drug war. Once primarily concerned with reintegrating parishioners into society after a prison stint, faith leaders are now beginning to question why otherwise good members of their flock are being incarcerated in the first place.  The drug war is terrible economics, violates fundamental liberties, and destroys families and communities, and that is why ending the drug war is a conservative position.

A final vote is expected on a resolution which calls on the church to divest from three companies, Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola Solutions, with operations in Israel. Divestment supporters say the targeted companies are profiting from Palestinian suffering. The American Jewish Committee, a public policy group, has said the proposal demonizes Israel and threatens Christian-Jewish relations. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cddb3c000066000df676.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When there is a just resolution to the Israel/Palestine conflict, I will claim that June 20, 2014 marked a turning point. That was the day that the Presbyterian Church, USA voted to divest from Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions as a result of these companies' continued involvement in the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and these companies' continued refusal to change their policies.Many people are fond of saying that the Israel/Palestine conflict is complicated. Of course it's a truism: all interesting things in human affairs are complicated. But frequently the intent of saying that the Israel/Palestine conflict is complicated is to imply that the listener should refrain from trying to do something about it. It's complicated, so don't worry your pretty little head about it. Of course, if we accept the idea that we shouldn't try to do anything because ""it's complicated,"" we're not being neutral. If we do nothing when there is a good opportunity for an ethical and helpful action, we take the side of the status quo. What's going on Iraq is complicated. But we don't need to know and understand every detail of Iraq's political history to understand that U.S. military force is not going to solve Iraq's political problems and that demands for direct U.S. military intervention in Iraq are a bad idea that we should oppose. Telling your Member of Congress to oppose U.S. airstrikes in Iraq is an ethical and helpful action. You don't need a degree in Iraqi history to take the action with a good conscience. The basic idea of divesting from the Israeli occupation is quite simple. It is generally understood that at the end of the day a just resolution to the conflict is going to be a resolution that's negotiated. But right now the Palestinian victims of occupation do not have enough political power to negotiate a just resolution. The U.S.-led (so-called) ""peace process"" has failed, fundamentally, to produce a resolution because the U.S. and its allies have been unable or unwilling to stop the Israeli government from confiscating and building on Palestinian territory in the West Bank that any representative group of Palestinians would insist would have to be part of a Palestinian state in order for a two state resolution to the conflict to be a just resolution. If there is to be a just resolution, some sufficiently potent other groups of people will have to effectively weigh in on the side of the Palestinian victims of occupation. In this context, the Presbyterian vote to divest from the Israeli occupation could be the ""end of the beginning"" of efforts to bring about a just resolution of the conflict.Until now, supporters of the occupation have effectively used threats and intimidation to block effective action to help redress the power imbalance so that Palestinians can negotiate a just resolution. But when the Presbyterians voted to divest, it was a decisive repudiation of these threats. And in the future, if these threats are deployed to try to block action to redress the power imbalance, the power of these threats is going to be greatly diminished. Suppose that another American Protestant church now contemplates divesting from the Israeli occupation. Suppose that supporters of the occupation try to block this action by accusing the supporters of divestment of being people who hate Jews. Will any significant group of mainstream American Protestants see this as a credible threat?After June 20, 2014, to assert in the United States that people who support divestment from the Israeli occupation hate Jews you must also assert that 1.8 million Presbyterians in the United States hate Jews. No significant group of mainstream Protestants in the United States will see this as a credible threat, after the Presbyterians succeeded in staring it down. The Presbyterians stood tall in the face of threats and lived to tell the tale, people will say. Why should we be cowards?This turning point in our national discourse about the Israel-Palestine conflict is a significant political achievement, and the lion's share of the credit goes to the Presbyterians who have been slogging away on this front for 10 years. But it is beyond reasonable dispute that Jewish Voice for Peace played a decisive role. I was at the Presbyterian general assembly, following the debate. The argument that was most invoked by the opponents of divestment amounted to this: if we divest from the Israeli occupation, the Jewish community will be mad at us.The presence -- or the ""witness,"" as some Christians might say - of Jewish Voice for Peace at the Presbyterian assembly undermined this argument. It did not stop this argument from being made; it did not stop this argument from having weight. It undermined this argument just enough to prevent it from carrying the day. Here's how the New York Times told the story:Of more influence was the presence at the church's convention all week of Jewish activists, many of them young, in black T-shirts with the slogan ""Another Jew Supporting Divestment."" Many of them were with Jewish Voice for Peace, a small but growing organization that promotes divestment and works with Palestinian and Christian groups on the left.Now, given that the Presbyterians were told that the main reason to vote against divestment was that Jews who support the Israeli occupation were going to be mad, what do you suppose is happening now? Jews who support the Israeli occupation are denouncing the Presbyterians.Of course, Jewish Voice for Peace is pushing back against the people who are attacking the Presbyterians. You can add your voice here."

But the ever-constant popularity of these iconic symbols of the American wild masks a disturbing reality about the bear's continued precarious status in the continental United States.With the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service moving toward dropping Endangered Species Act protections for grizzly bears that live in and around Yellowstone National Park, few Americans likely realize the bears occupy a mere 4 percent of their historic range in the lower 48 states.And that's simply not good enough to make sure grizzly bears are around for centuries to come.With their small, isolated populations in Yellowstone and elsewhere in the northern Rockies increasingly threatened by inbreeding, climate change and ongoing human population growth, grizzlies face an uncertain future at best. To make sure the bears are given a fair chance of surviving these relentless pressures, I filed a legal petition last week on behalf of the organization I work for, the Center for Biological Diversity, calling on the Fish and Wildlife Service to greatly expand its plans for recovering grizzly bears. The petition identifies 110,000 square miles of potential grizzly habitat in places like California's Sierra Nevada, the Gila/Mogollon complex in Arizona and New Mexico, Utah's Uinta Mountains, and the Grand Canyon in Arizona -- areas that have the potential to triple the bear's population to 6,000. As many as 100,000 grizzly bears once ranged most of western North America, from the high Arctic to the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico and from the coast of California across most of the Great Plains. Within 200 years of European settlement, wanton slaughter had reduced populations to perhaps several hundred bears, mostly found in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho. With protection under the Endangered Species Act, grizzly bears have seen some recovery, now numbering between 1,500 and 1,800 bears, but this recovery has been limited to Yellowstone and Glacier national parks and surrounding areas. In the other areas where bears survive, parts of northern Idaho, Montana and Washington, small bear populations continue to struggle on the brink of extinction, and nothing has been done to expand bears to the many areas in which they once occurred. In 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledged its 1993 recovery plan for the bear was out of date and that there was a need to consider additional areas in the West for recovery. But rather than moving to develop a new plan, the agency has been working to remove protections for Yellowstone's bears and let states allow hunting of bears. Such a fragmented approach to recovery in which protections are removed for parts of a species' range before the species as a whole has recovered has been a disaster for wolves, leading to aggressive hunting and trapping that has caused the death of thousands of wolves and is reversing decades of hard work towards recovery. The reality is that bears are in too few places and in too little numbers to be moving toward removing protections and allowing hunting. Instead, we need a larger vision of grizzly bear recovery that gets these amazing animals into as many places with sufficient habitat in their historic range as possible. Such an approach would benefit the many places that once had bears, which play a critical role in balancing ecosystems by regulating deer and elk populations that are their prey, by spreading seeds of many plants and by tilling soil when they dig for insects and roots. More bears in more places would benefit people, too, through opportunities to view an animal with no equal as a symbol of America's wild past.We have a legal and moral duty to make sure grizzlies are part of America's future.To make sure that's the case, we must right a historic wrong and restore bears across the West in sustainable numbers to make sure this stunning animal is emblematic, not of who we once were, as a country, but of who we are, right now."

To the delight of the crowd in Brasilia, the 22-year-old opened the scoring in the host's final Group A match in the 17th minute when he sent a right-footed shot past goalkeeper Charles Itandje after Luis Gustavo delivered a cross that found him just steps from the penalty spot.Cameroon, already eliminated from contention before kickoff, equalized in the 26th minute but Neymar quickly reinstated the Brazil lead. Slicing through the Cameroon defense, Neymar scored his second goal of the match with another right-footed shot that Itandje couldn't track in the 34th minute.(GIF via @PeteBlackburn)Brazil would add a third goal shortly after halftime when Fred, possibly offside, got his head to a cross from David Luiz. In the 84th minute, Fernandinho tallied the final score of the game to ensure that Brazil topped Group A. Both Brazil and Mexico finished the group stage with seven points after wins on Monday. The hosts advanced as the group winner thanks to a superior goal differential. "

Allegedly. A zig-zag pattern shaved on the side of the star striker's head has many speculating the hairdo is a tribute to young boy whose brain surgery Ronaldo paid for himself. Even for those who revile Ronaldo, this possible twist is too good of a story to resist. Ronaldo hasn't confirmed anything about his hairdo, but in an attempt to separate fact from fiction, Deadspin casts a skeptical eye on the story by pointing out there's just one social media post from that's been re-shared (with new facts appearing in different iterations) to serve as ""proof"": Ronaldo cut his hair to match the scar of a young fan who had surgery to remove a brain tumor last week. #respect pic.twitter.com/weaTKPNG5nEven if it turns out the questionable hairdo is not a touching tribute to a sick boy but rather a piece of fiction spun up by a Ronaldo fan or social media prankster, credit where it's due:Ronaldo did indeed pay the medical costs for Erik Ortiz Cruz, a 10-month-old Spanish boy (Ronaldo plays professionally for Spain's Real Madrid) suffering from an epilepsy-causing congenital abnormality in the brain called cortical dysplasia. In March Ronaldo ""quietly wrote a personal check for $83,000"" to cover Cruz' medical costs after he was asked to donate items for a charity auction benefitting the child, the LA Times reports. Ronaldo reportedly even offered to pay for follow-up treatments which cost roughly $8,000 a visit.Frustrating as it may be for Ronaldo's detractors, his reputation as a preening footballer -- one so vain he opened a museum dedicated to his own achievements -- can't negate his quiet acts of charity.After all, it makes sense that the sport's best villain is also intriguingly complex.

It could have been the many times his father struck him as a child, or it could have been from the times the ""coyotes,"" as human smugglers are known in Latin America, punched him for speaking out loud and revealing his Honduran accent as he traveled illegally through Mexico on his way to the United States.""I don't know, it could've been a combination of a lot of things,"" Zelaya, a Ph.D. student in urban education at Texas A&M University, told The Huffington Post. ""I remember that journey, and every day I live with this. I remember those things."" Zelaya made his journey in 2000, when he was 13 years old. Around that time, U.S. authorities were apprehending roughly 6,775 unaccompanied minors a year for crossing the border illegally. This year, immigration authorities expect a surge of more than 70,000 unaccompanied minors to cross illegally into the United States, the majority of them from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Unlike Mexican minors, most of whom are repatriated immediately through a special process the U.S. only applies to Mexican and Canadian citizens, minors from Central America must be handed off to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Once a child is given to the ORR, the office shelters him or her and usually locates a parent or guardian to whom he or she can be released while deportation proceedings are initiated. But the sudden surge of unaccompanied minors has overwhelmed a system designed to handle a capacity closer to 8,000 than 70,000.The sharp increase of teenagers and preteens showing up at the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America has prompted conservatives to blame the White House for its 2012 Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals policy, which exempts many undocumented immigrants brought here as children from deportation for a renewable two-year period. U.S. Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) called on President Barack Obama Friday to send National Guard troops to deal with the crisis. Conservatives have also blasted the Latin-American media, accusing reporters of spreading the false idea that newly arrived immigrants will benefit from DACA. In fact, only immigrants who were living in the U.S. before the policy was enacted may apply. The White House denies the Republicans' allegations, contending that worsening conditions in Central America have led to what it calls an ""urgent humanitarian situation"" at the border. On Friday, the Obama administration announced it would ""surge"" its immigration enforcement at the Texas border to speed the deportations of recent arrivals. The administration also said it will open facilities to detain families that cross illegally, and will coordinate with Central American governments to spread the message that new arrivals crossing illegally will be returned. But interviews with law enforcement officials, advocates and experts suggest that the DACA theory is inaccurate and the White House story is incomplete. Like Zelaya, most of those coming to the United States are fleeing poverty and widespread violence at home, and seeking a relative here. At the same time, conditions in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have opened an opportunity for smugglers to exploit the inefficiency of a U.S. immigration system universally denounced as ""broken."" Desperate families, often operating on the flawed premise that unaccompanied minors won't be deported if they make it across the border, are more than willing to take advantage of the situation if it means sheltering their children from war-like murder rates and grinding poverty.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCEGang activity, growing involvement in the drug war and a history of political instability make Central America one of the most violent regions in the world. With a homicide rate of 90.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012, according to the most recent available data from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, Honduras is the world's most violent country outside of a war zone. El Salvador and Guatemala aren't far behind, with the world's fourth- and fifth-highest homicide rates, respectively. The already impoverished countries, whose economies are closely tied to the U.S. export market, saw poverty rates climb in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, according to World Bank data. Masked members of the 18th Street gang give a press conference inside the San Pedro Sula prison in Honduras, Tuesday, May 28, 2013.Adam Isacson at the Washington Office on Latin America, a non-governmental organization based in Washington, D.C., recently visited Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, where he said migrants invariably cited the need for money and security as the reasons driving them to leave their homes. ""The conversation with migrants is always economic,"" Isacson told HuffPost. ""Then you scratch the surface for five minutes and it's problems with violence.""The United States, ironically enough, has played a major role in creating the messes in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Under the pretext of containing communism during the Cold War, the U.S. government ushered in decades of violent misrule and civil conflict in Guatemala by helping to overthrow the elected government of Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. Under similar justifications, the U.S. poured billions of dollars into the Salvadoran and Honduran militaries, even as they committed atrocities against civilians. ""We funded civil wars, which created enormous refugee problems,"" Isacson said. ""We deported anyone who was in those communities that had a criminal record, which started the gang problem. And after the civil wars ended, we slashed our aid programs for almost anything besides drug war policies. To this day, you still can't significantly fund any of those priorities in Congress unless it's going through a counter-narcotics program."" Political instability has created a favorable environment for lawlessness. The region's recent spike in crime owes to the rise of hyperviolent gangs and drug cartels. Many unaccompanied minors interviewed by researchers said they left due to threats to their lives or their families from gangs attempting to recruit them, according to Mother Jones. The violence and poverty isn't causing people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to come just to the United States. Since 2009, asylum applications from those three countries have skyrocketed 712 percent in the neighboring nations of Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Belize, according to WOLA. But most of the migrants wind up in the United States, for the simple reason that Central American migratory flows are long established, and many young people have family members here. HUMAN EXPLOITATIONThe children making this journey from Central America to the United States, crossing multiple borders illegally along the way, aren't doing it alone. Generally speaking, they are guided by human smugglers, known in Spanish as ""coyotes,"" who charge the children's families thousands of dollars for the service. Despite frequent exhortations from U.S. lawmakers to ramp up border security, illegal immigration from Mexico has in reality plummeted since the economic crisis of 2008, largely due to an improving Mexican economy and slackening demographic pressure on the Mexican labor market. With their primary market drying up, smugglers are pushing into Central America to find new clients, according to David Aguilar, former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. ""This is an opportunity they're looking to exploit,"" Aguilar told HuffPost. Meagan McKenna, the communications director for Kids in Need of Defense, an organization that represents unaccompanied minors facing deportation, echoed Aguilar's thoughts, though she emphasized that problems in Central America have done more to cause the crisis than the actions of smugglers. ""There's no question that smugglers are taking advantage of the situation, and the push factors and the desperation of their families,"" McKenna told HuffPost. ""More girls are coming than ever before. And they're coming despite the fact that it's well known that many of these girls are sexually abused along the trip. I think that speaks to the desperation driving this."" A HOLE IN THE SYSTEMIf migrants believe that unaccompanied minors from Central America will be allowed to stay, it likely has little to do with DACA and a lot to do with the way those children are handled by the immigration system once they arrive.Boys wait in line to make a phone call at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center on June 18, 2014, in Nogales, Arizona.The White House has repeatedly tried to dispel the idea that Central American minors who make it to the United States can stay here. But in practice, many do just that. Unlike Mexican minors who cross the border illegally, unaccompanied minors from Central America are not immediately repatriated. Instead, they are often given a notice to appear in immigration court and released to the custody of a family member residing in the United States. At the same time, U.S. immigration courts are hopelessly backlogged. Depending on the jurisdiction, it could take years for someone who crosses illegally today to have his or her case decided in court, and many people never appear in court at all. Word of the hole in the immigration enforcement system has spread to Central America, according to The New York Times: Central American migrants interviewed by Times reporter Julia Preston in Texas referred to the notice they received to appear in immigration court as a ""permiso,"" Spanish for ""permit.""Republicans have tried to foist the blame for the problem on the White House, calling Obama lax on enforcement, despite the fact that his administration didn't invent the policy and has, indeed, carried out more deportations in six years than the George W. Bush administration did in eight. But simple enforcement won't solve the unaccompanied minors crisis anyway, says Aguilar, given the intractable root of problems in Central America and the issues facing the overloaded U.S. immigration system. ""Enforcement is a critical part of the solution to this problem, but it's not the sole solution,"" Aguilar told HuffPost. ""What we'd be doing by sending more enforcement resources -- if that's all we do -- is creating a larger glove to catch more unaccompanied children.""The plan the Obama administration announced Friday includes making more immigration judges available to process deportation cases and asylum claims, in order to speed the removal of new arrivals.In the meantime, children and teenagers lie cramped in overcrowded quarters as the federal government tries to find bed space for them. Zelaya says he's been losing sleep since photos began to surface this month of Central American minors packed into U.S. facilities too small to house them.He asked why Central American undocumented minors can't be treated the same way the U.S. government treats Cuban nationals, who are allowed to become legal residents and apply for citizenship if they make it to U.S. soil under a policy known as ""wet foot/dry foot."" ""These kids made it, and now they're here,"" Zelaya said. ""Why can't these children also be treated as refugees? That's what they're migrating for ... Think how much these children would really appreciate and love a country that would give them the opportunity to spend their lives here and help them. I am grateful to this country."""
