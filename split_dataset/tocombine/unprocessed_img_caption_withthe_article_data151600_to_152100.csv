Does the woman even own a white tee?There was an awesome printed Lela Rose vest, an on-trend Burberry trench coat and a covetable utility jacket (seriously, we'd like to steal it). While we didn't love the oversized tunic she chose for a Riverdance performance, Michelle generally maintained a strong enough fashion game to compete with her increasingly-trendy daughters.

Using a MakerBot 3D printer, a popular model available to consumers, Nelson calculated the amount of time it would take to build a standard house made up of 27,735 bricks -- all by determining the amount of time it took the printer to create a single brick (which measured 8 inches by 3.5 inches by 2.75 inches.)""A typical 2,500-square-foot, two-story house would take 220 years to print out and use more than $330,000 in plastics. I ran the numbers on my own home and it would only take 120 years and $182,000 to make it with a MakerBot printer. That doesn't even include extras, like windows, wood flooring, or heating.""Yikes! But don't get us wrong -- the prospect of creating architecture with this method isn't news to us. DUS Architects, for example, are slated to complete one of these ambitious projects along the bank of the Buiksloter-canal in Amsterdam. But unlike Nelson's experiment, the firm is using a much bigger machine called the Kamer Maker (which they've put to work on a series of other structures before.) With this technology, the odds of finishing full-scale dwellings in a more manageable timeframe aren't totally unbelievable.Needless to say, for now the process remains too time-consuming and costly for the typical homeowner.

However, you should know that you're not riding this emotional roller coaster by yourself. Oh, no. There are plenty of us out there who know exactly what it's like to spend an entire Saturday at IKEA. It usually goes a little something like this... You start your day with trepidation realizing you have to go.Once you get there, it's straight to the restaurant -- you'll need your energy. After some meatballs and Lingonberry juice, you plan your route to find what you came for (AKA follow those big arrows on the floor.)All the while, you get distracted by trying to pronounce the name of the piece to a store employee. (Good thing for those yellow shirts.)And of course, you have to take a break to try out that new chair/ bed/ fuzzy rug.Finally, you've found what you came for.

Take that Meat Fruit, which seems to have become the restaurant's signature dish.",2013-06-18,Dinner by Heston Blumenthal: The Dining Room With A View Of Hyde Park And Of The Kitchen,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d44c42000003100fde6a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Soon after it opened in 2011, Jackie and I had a post-theater supper at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal in the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park hotel. Between the newness of the restaurant and the lateness of the hour, there was cause for disappointment: Our meal was marred by imprecise cooking and unfocused service. But Mr. Blumenthal and Dinner's head chef Ashley Palmer-Watts are the most precise of cooks and know what attentive service means, so I looked forward to a return visit. This took place in late May and was delightful. The conceit of the restaurant is that its chefs have pored over old English cookbooks to discern the outlines of the dishes they serve, and the menu lists the putative date for each, such as ""Meat Fruit (c. 1500)."" Hmmm.... Anyway, the cooking is so modern and fresh that links to the medieval or Victorian or WWII-era sources are hardly to be detected. Take that Meat Fruit, which seems to have become the restaurant's signature dish: It is a perfectly seasoned, rich-but-not-cloying sphere of 21st century chicken liver and foie gras parfait enrobed in a 21st century mandarin orange gel that has been impressed with the texture of the fruit's rind. With a (genuine) mandarin stem and leaves stuck into it, it really, truly looks like something out of the fruit bowl, even more so than you'd think from the photo that accompanies this story. But it is not just a visual joke, though it made us laugh with delight: That gel has lots of flavor and is a perfect foil for the mousse. Yes, Blumenthal-style science and technology underlie the recipes here, but (except for the tableside liquid-nitrogen ice cream service) the diner can ignore them -- which is as it should be. The produce is stunningly fresh and flavorful (such fennelly fennel!) and is cooked to maximize its quality; the colors, textures and flavors are all enticing, the combinations unimpeachable. And, boy oh boy, what french fries (""triple cooked chips"")!Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, 66 Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7LA; +44 (0)20 7201 3833; http://www.dinnerbyheston.com/. Open for lunch and dinner every day. Dinner for two with a modest wine - and a side of fries - about £190 ($300).Shoreditch, north of the hopping Spitalfields area, is becoming a destination for restaurant-seekers, with new places cropping up every week, or so it seems. The Clove Club opened three months ago in what used to be Shoreditch Town Hall; the front room offers a short à la carte and bar menu, and in the evening a more ambitious multi-course £47 ($74) prix-fixe is served in the back room. We were there for lunch with a friend (who used to live around the corner and who gave us a walking tour of the neighborhood), and ate several small dishes: quartered heads of crisp Belgian endive dressed with crunchy hazelnuts; home-made rye crackers with smoked-cod-roe dip; pigeon sausage with the restaurant's own ketchup; boneless fried chicken scented with pine; and braised kid served warm over a cool vegetable salad with fresh curd cheese. The pigeon sausage had a grainy texture that didn't appeal to me, but everything else was spot-on, especially the chicken ""nuggets,"" of which our friend wisely insisted we order two portions. They were enhanced by that rosemary-like hint of pine and by the fact that the coating never, ever stopped being crunchy. We should have ordered three, plus one more to go.The Clove Club. Shoreditch Town Hall, 380 Old Street, London EC1V 9LT; +44 (0) 20 7729 6496; www.thecloveclub.com. Lunch for two with a cocktail apiece, then wine by the glass, would be around £63 ($100).It isn't all that long since I wrote about Green Man & French Horn, which specializes in the wine and food of the Loire Valley, but the two dishes we had there late one evening in June are worth mentioning. The first was an appetizer (which Jackie found easily big enough to suffice as a one-dish meal with the restaurant's good bread and butter) of crab and celeriac remoulade: thin strands of both ingredients -- which turn out to be entirely complementary - bound with a sharp, mustardy dressing: a nice variation on the celeriac-only classic. The moment that celery root appears in our New York farmers' markets, I'll be making a version of this at home and probably reporting on it over at Huffington Post Taste. The other was a thick bone-in slice of turbot cut from the nicely gelatinous ""collar"" end and served with capers and crisp fried artichokes. I often order turbot when on the other side of the Atlantic, where it is fished, and I've never had it more perfectly cooked than it was here -- and with such a noble fish, not much more is needed. With half a liter of a Loire Valley white, this was about as good as a quick after-theater supper gets.Green Man & French Horn. 54 Saint Martin's Lane, London WC2N 4EA, +44 (0) 207 836-2645, http://www.greenmanfrenchhorn.co.

Not since Miss Teen South Carolina contestant Caitlin Upton has someone botched an answer during a live pageant so badly. But Powell isn't blaming her brains -- she's blaming her nerves. ""What was going through your mind?"" asked Matt Lauer. ""Oh my gosh, so much,"" she said. ""I can't even tell you. I was so excited and I was so nervous. I got up to this Top Five question and I was the first one. And I got up and the question was a little bit confusing to me and I just started speaking without even processing. I just started going."" TMZ reported Miss Utah is telling those close to her that she is humiliated she ""spaced out"" during the live show. Supposedly she never really even heard the question asked to her. Instead of asking judge NeNe Leakes to repeat it, she just decided to blurt out whatever came to mind, all while becoming more and more flustered. Sian Beilock, professor of psychology at the University of Chicago, had a similar theory regarding the very public mishap. “People start worrying and that eats up their brainpower,” she told NBC News, adding that when too many thoughts are swimming around the brain processing becomes sluggish. “When all eyes are on us, it makes us stumble on our words. It disrupts the things that [usually] work on autopilot.”Powell, who wound up finishing as third runner-up, seems to be trying to take it all in stride.

9,WELLNESS,Meditation In Action: 5 Tips For Mindful Cooking (PHOTOS),,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meditation-in-action-mindful-cooking_us_5b9d4319e4b03a1dcc860ca4,"Fast Cooking (Lots To Do) 1. Begin from the very first moment you place the water on the heat, or pour the oil in the pan",2013-06-17,"Young woman on kitchen table, in yoga position with candles",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d431924000031005384a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By HeadspaceWhere is your mind when you’re cooking? Is it busy planning tomorrow’s schedule as the knife moves closer and closer towards your fingers along the length of a carrot? Is the mind still wrapped up in some excitement from earlier in the day, replaying a conversation over and over again as you put the rice or pasta on to cook? When we are looking forward to the future or back to the past, then by definition we cannot be in the present.Cooking provides a wonderful opportunity to be present, mindful and aware, as opposed to being distracted, stressed or overwhelmed. It's an opportunity to train the mind, to understand what it means to be in the here and now, with a healthy sense of appreciation, patience. It’s also an opportunity to get back in touch with the food that you eat.So here are two short exercises in mindful cooking from the meditation experts at Headspace to help you find some ""me time"" in what is sometimes considered a monotonous task.The two exercises are aimed to suit the different types of food you might be making. If it's an oven baked dish, for example, then you have nothing to do but sit back and remain alert to your senses as you gently focus on the breath. But, if you are boiling, grilling or frying then you’re going to need to remain somewhat active and involved, as you stir, shake, flip or fry. Remember, to get the most from these exercises, it's a good idea to switch off your phone and remove any other potential distraction from the kitchen. Slow Cooking (Little To Do) 1. Placing the food in the oven, grill or casserole, set the heat, the timer, and make sure there is nothing else you need to think about. 2. Sit in a chair not too far from the oven and relax into it. You have nothing to do but to stay alert to the changing sounds, smells, sensations and thoughts as you gently focus your attention on the breath. Try it just for a few minutes at a time to begin with, perhaps returning to the kitchen every 10–15 minutes or so to repeat the exercise and notice the changes. 3. There’s no need to worry if your mind wanders off while you’re doing this, but as soon as you realize it has, just bring your attention back to the breath. Then shift your attention to the other senses, such as the smell, the increasingly warm temperature in the room or the rumbling in your stomach as the digestive juices begin to flow in preparation for the meal.  4. Be as accurate as you can in recognizing the different smells, fragrances, flavors and foods as they cook. Imagine you are trying to pick up every last scent, every last nuance. It's surprising just how much you can recognize when you really put your mind to it. 5. As you become aware of these things, notice where your mind wants to travel. Does it drift off to memories past, perhaps associating the smells with previous meals? Or does it race ahead to the future, perhaps imagining what the food is going to taste like? This doesn’t require any analysis or thinking, it is simply a matter of being aware. Fast Cooking (Lots To Do) 1. Begin from the very first moment you place the water on the heat, or pour the oil in the pan. Listen to the sounds, the smells and the sensations that the heat immediately gives rise to.  2. As you begin to cook the various foods, notice how the addition of each new ingredient affects the overall fragrance of the dish. Allow yourself to be 100 percent present with the different senses, rather than being lost in thought. Each time the mind wanders, just gently bring the attention back to these sounds and smells.  3. Try to be aware of how your mood and your thinking changes throughout the cooking process. Do you find the heat oppressive? Do you find yourself getting anxious trying to keep all the different things going at once, or confident and in control? Don’t try and change any of these things for now –- simply building up a picture is enough. 4. As you observe the mind, use the physical senses as a safe place to come back to when you feel the emotions running off. For example, rather than feeling anxious about feeling anxious, come back to the smell of the food.

Is it a mind that’s comfortable being in the moment? Or does it tend to race off to plan things for the future, or drift off to memories of the past? Being aware of the thoughts in this way will help you to get much better at the exercise, which, for most people, means enjoying a more serene experience in the kitchen.Want more tips on how to make meditation part of your day?
