Last year's winning bid was $3.46 million, which topped the previous year's $2.63 million top bid from fund manager Ted Weschler, who was later hired as an investment manager at Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.This year's anonymous winner, who paid the lowest amount in six years at exactly $1,000,100, will have lunch with the Nebraska billionaire and up to seven friends at Smith & Wollensky in New York City. The five-day auction on eBay, which closed on Friday evening, received 106 bids.Buffett, 82, who was introduced to GLIDE by his late first wife Susan, has held 14 auctions raising more than $15 million for the organization, which was founded 50 years ago.The San Francisco Business Times reported the Rev. Cecil Williams, GLIDE's founder, as saying budget cuts were likely due to the surprisingly low auction results.Williams, speaking to Reuters on Saturday, said the quote was inaccurate, and GLIDE would continue its fundraising efforts to meet its $17 million annual budget. He expressed gratitude for Buffett's longtime support and for the winning bid, calling it an important gift.""We never know what will come. So we are very proud about what has taken place last night, and we feel we are on the right direction, doing the right thing, and making it count,"" Williams said. "

Greece's negotiations with international lenders for desperately needed rescue funds some two weeks before bankruptcy looms are stuck, the IMF said on November 1, sending Greek stocks plunging.

But adaptable animals — both wild and domestic — are learning to navigate our cities, and many are even boarding buses and trains to do so.  Here’s a look at some headline-making animal ""commuters"" from around the world.  Pigeon passengers In New York, pigeons are known to catch a ride on the city subway, boarding trains at outdoor terminals and exiting at stops farther down the line. Subway workers say the birds are motivated by hunger. They enter in search of food crumbs and unwittingly find themselves riding public transportation.  Russia's rail-riding dogs Moscow’s 35,000 stray dogs have developed many tactics to surviving in the city. They’ve been observed obeying traffic lights, and witnesses say they’re notorious for the “bark-and-grab,” a ploy that involves startling people into dropping their snacks. They also ride the subway.  After a day of scavenging on the streets, the dogs board the train — choosing the quiet carriages at the front and back — and return to the suburbs. Experts say the canines have learned to judge the length of time to spend on the train and even work together to make sure they get off at the right stop.  Scientists believe the strays’ behavior can be traced back to the Soviet Union’s collapse, when Russia’s new capitalists moved industrial complexes to the suburbs.  Pub-frequenting pup Ratty, a 10-year-old Jack Russell terrier in North Yorkshire, England, became a celebrity in 2006 when the media discovered that he had hopped rides on the local bus. The dog would ride 5 miles to the Black Bull Pub, where he was a welcome regular and he would snack on sausages. Unfortunately, Ratty was hit by a car and killed in 2010 as he sat at the bus stop.  Commuting cats England certainly seems to have its share of bus-frequenting felines. The first cat to make headlines for riding public transportation was Casper, a rescue who started queuing with people at the bus stop across from his house in 2002. Soon he was taking daily bus rides and curling up in warm seats. His public transportation habit made him a celebrity and a book was even written about his travels called “Casper the Commuting Cat.” Unfortunately, Casper was hit by a car and killed in 2010.  In 2007, a white cat with one blue eye and one green started boarding the Walsall to Wolverhampton bus at the same time each morning and getting off at a stop farther down the road. Drivers nicknamed him “Macavity” and suspected he that he chose his stop because it’s located next to a fish-and-chips stop.  A 15-year-old ginger cat named Dodger made headlines in 2011 for hopping onto buses at the stop behind his U.K. home. He’s such a regular rider that he curls up in commuters’ laps and drivers bring him tins of cat food and remind him to get off at his stop.  Goat on the go In 2008, a 35-pound goat somehow hitched a ride on a Portland, Ore., bus, and Multnomah County Animal Control took the animal into custody for “lack of proper fare.” The goat’s owners didn’t even realize he was missing until they saw the story on TV.  Coyote commute That same year, a coyote hopped on the light rail at the Portland airport and got comfortable on a seat. Before the train took off, wildlife specialists were called in to remove the critter.  Monkeys on the metro In India, monkeys are considered representatives of the Hindu god Hanuman, and tradition dictates that the animals be fed on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Because of this, Delhi’s monkey population has grown to the point that city officials have petitioned the Supreme Court to relieve them of the task of monkey control.  The monkeys, which are often aggressive, have stolen clothes, invaded the prime minister’s office and taken to riding buses and trains. In the video below, a monkey rides the Delhi metro and even responsibly holds onto the banister."

My husband would tag along and, once business had been taken care of, we'd escape to the hills of Tuscany for a few restorative days. The place we headed for was a remote, enchanting medieval hamlet called Borgo Pretale, now an exquisite hotel.Before long, Borgo Pretale and the charming people who run the place had become good friends and even part of our ""summer"" family. One evening, Daniele Rizzardini, the brilliant and endearing manager of the hotel, joined us for dinner on the lavender-lined terrace. On the menu that night were trofie, handmade little pasta squiggles.""Do you know about 'sexy pasta'?"" Daniele asked. I looked at him, incredulous, wondering if he was pulling my leg. ""Let me tell you a story,"" he went on. ""In the old days, the women of sea villages would get together in the afternoon. They would gather near the port, bringing with them a bowl of pasta dough and a chair, and casually roll trofie while waiting for their husbands to return from their fishing trips. The best part is that they rolled the pasta on the side of their knees... Sexy pasta!""I thought the story was enchanting. Suddenly my bowl of trofie had acquired a glow and I dove right in. Sexy or not, the pasta was sublime.A few weeks later, I found myself in my own kitchen, with a beautiful pasta dough I'd just made, trying to roll trofie on the side of my knee and feeling more than a bit ridiculous. It took a few tries for me to figure out that you had to be a fisherman's wife for this to work.Nowadays, I'm more inclined to buy my trofie already made, but every time I take a bite of the enticing squiggles, I can't help but think of Daniele and of the sexy knees of the fishermen's wives.Wine pairing: Ravines Wine Cellars, Pinot NoirTrofie with Arugula Pesto and Flash-Sautéed Cherry Tomatoes with Garlic ScapesServes 4 Active time: 30 minFor the pesto 4 oz (115 g) arugula - rinsed and spun dry 1 large garlic clove - skinned 1/3 cup blanched, sliced almonds 1/4 cup freshly grated Reggiano Parmesan 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano 1/2 teaspoon sea salt or to taste freshly ground black pepper to taste 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oilFor the pasta sea salt for the pasta water (about 1 tablespoon) 1 lb (455 g) Trofie or Gemelli 1 recipe Flash-Sautéed Cherry Tomatoes with Garlic Scapes and Chives chive tips as garnishStep 1: To make the pesto - Place all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor.

3,FOOD & DRINK,Why Can't We Regulate Restaurant Olive Oil?,"Zester Daily, Contributor
Zester Daily: The culture of food and drink.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restaurant-olive-oil-regulation_us_5b9d3a85e4b03a1dcc85be15,"Olive oil fraud: If we truly want to be sure that the oil in that bottle or on that table is what it says it is, then we must expect a lot more regulation.",2013-06-07,2013-06-06-OliveOilFromFaucet.CreditNancyJenkins.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-06-06-OliveOilFromFaucet.CreditNancyJenkins.jpg,"By Nancy Harmon JenkinsThe European Commission has shown customary timidity in abruptly withdrawing a proposal made last week to exert minimal control over the quality of olive oil served in restaurants. The idea behind the proposal was admirable -- that olive oil be served in original, tamper-proof bottles that state the oil's credentials on the label, rather than poured from an anonymous jug into cruets or bowls on the table. In that way, consumers would be certain of what they're being served and there would be no easy way of substituting bad oil for good. Restaurants, in the commission's words, should be ""obliged to use oil bottles equipped with an opening system which cannot be resealed after the first time it is opened, together with a protection system preventing them from being reused once the contents indicated on the label have been finished.""This was not a sudden decision. It had been discussed for at least a year. And to those of us who have encountered, over and over again, rancid, fusty, smelly, old oil in those colorful little bowls or cruets on restaurant tables -- even in some very fine establishments -- it made good sense. But the proposal evoked an outcry from journalists, chefs, restaurateurs and the public at large such that you might think the EC had proposed reinstating capital punishment.Related: Olive oil scam? Maybe not.Consumer protection? No way! This was out-and-out interference in commerce, the naysayers cried, especially commerce that involved ""little guys"" -- small-scale restaurateurs and café owners and small-farm producers of olive oil. This was Brussels interfering with time-honored traditions, forcing out modest concerns in favor of big industrial-sized multinationals that promote commodity olive oil. The virtue of this argument is difficult to understand because large producers would have very little to gain from the proposal. But in the end, the EC, bowing to pressure on all sides, withdrew the regulation.Much of the uproar came from sources with nothing on the table. I cannot speak for the German press, but British journalists suddenly had, as they themselves might say, their knickers in a twist over the proposal. Silly Europeans, the Brits snickered, there they go again, fussing over trivia, imposing ridiculous rules on innocent restaurateurs, as if they didn't have anything else to worry about in Brussels. Why don't they do something about the economy instead?Related: Does cooking kill extra virgin olive oil?Elsewhere, however, the outcry was even more difficult to understand and I got the impression that most people simply had not read the proposal. It is not a hardship for restaurateurs to provide tamper-proof bottles of olive oil since that is the way most small quantities of olive oil are sold. I buy oil in half-liter bottles or tins in local shops where I live in Tuscany. These containers almost uniformly have a plastic pour spout inside that is difficult to remove, and through which it would be difficult to refill the bottle. Furthermore, bottles such as these are the product of many different olive oil purveyors, from small, local farmers to substantial wineries that also produce oil for large, supra-national concerns. Disposing of the bottles once the contents are gone is also an easy task -- they simply go into the glass-product recycling bins that are universal in most of Europe.Check out the following excerpt from Public Radio International's ""The World,"" a daily NPR news program:At a little café in a Spanish village. . . the owner, a guy named Aris, says he's indignant [about the new regulations]. Aris drives to his favorite olive orchard . . . to buy his oil right out of the presses. He tops up his big five-gallon jugs, and each morning at the café he fills his oil flasks by hand, then sets one on each table. . . . He says he doesn't understand how Europe can have a problem with this.The problem, simply stated, is that all over Europe, thousands of restaurateurs, large and small, top off oil flasks or cruets or bowls with what is most likely not extra virgin at all but a much lesser grade of olive oil -- if, in fact, it is even olive oil and not some cheap substitute. And if it is extra virgin, it will most likely be rancid, fusty and several years out of date -- just a few of the most common faults in extra virgin olive oil that not only give bad flavors and aromas to the food served, but also ultimately are bad for diners' health. And even if it happens to be good olive oil when it goes into the flasks that are filled, day after day over the years without being cleaned, it's inevitable that the ""fresh"" oil added will be thoroughly contaminated by the nastiness at the bottom of the flask.I would hazard a conservative guess, based on long years of experience, that at least 70 percent of the oil on tables in European restaurants, and at least 85 percent of the oil on tables in American restaurants, would not pass muster if the research team at UC Davis' Olive Center were to take up the challenge and test them for their extra virginity. When they tested imported extra virgin oils available in California retail shops a couple of years ago, of the top five best-selling imported ""extra virgin"" olive oil brands in the United States, 73 percent failed to meet sensory standards.Related: What's the issue with setting olive oil standards?Which is why, when I go to an ordinary restaurant, and even sometimes to extraordinary ones, even in the olive oil-producing regions of Spain, Greece, Italy and California, I carry with me a small, discreet tin of high-quality extra virgin to adorn my dishes when necessary in order to avoid what's in those cute glass, or rustic terracotta, or other type of cruets that sit on every restaurant table. (Of course, that doesn't save me from the fact that they've been cooking my food with that junk, does it?)Essentially, the problem the EC was trying to address was consumer fraud, a serious concern with olive oil, in Europe as everywhere else in the world -- as many of these same journalists have been whining about for years. The new requirement would have prevented unscrupulous restaurateurs from filling their cruets with questionable oil. It was a tiny step forward in government efforts to combat fraud and to prevent what is all too often nasty, out-of-date, fake, unacceptable oil from being served up as if it were something genuine and special.One simply cannot have it both ways. We cannot moan over fraudulent olive oil masquerading as fine extra virgin, and then gripe and sneer when the government takes a first, tentative step toward rectifying the situation. If we truly want reform, if we truly want to be sure that the oil in that bottle or on that table is what it says it is, then we must expect a lot more similar, and quite possibly even more stringent regulation in the years ahead. And welcome to it!Top photo: Fresh pressed extra virgin olive oil in Italy.
