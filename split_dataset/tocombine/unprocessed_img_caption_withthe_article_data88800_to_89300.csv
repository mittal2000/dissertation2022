0,FIFTY,5 Things Baby Boomers Miss Most Part 5,"Jay Lickus, ContributorFounder, Survive55.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-things-baby-boomers-miss-most-part-5_b_7274464.html,"I have come to notice over the past few years that my ""little dancing friend"" doesn't show up as often in the mornings.",2015-05-18,2015-05-13-1431525526-2829124-brunettewifetestinghusbandsstandingcock.gif,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-13-1431525526-2829124-brunettewifetestinghusbandsstandingcock-thumb.gif,"5 Things Baby Boomers Miss Most - Part 5Baby Boomers,Today, as promised, I bring you the final episode of my five-part series where we've talked about those thing we took for granted in our youth that we miss and wish we could have back now. To recap, thus far, the four that baby boomers miss the most are:1. Playing competitive sports 2. Having the eyesight of a young person 3. Drinking without lasting side effects 4. Eating your favorite foodsToday's thing that I will talk about will probably be the ""hardest"" of the five to discuss.I am ""hard-headed"" yet ""firm"" believer in maintaining the most ""rigid"" standards of writing quality and I have always""held"" myself to ""hardened"" and ""unbending"" principles on dispensing only ""upstanding"" and ""elevated"" levels of content that is then ""exposed"" to my followers.After today, you will probably no longer believe that about me.But I beg of you to remain ""hard and fast"" in your convictions and keep a ""stiff"" upper lip and see this blog through to it's ""climax.""Any idea what the fifth ""thingy"" I miss the most from my youth is?Well, as embarrassing as it is to admit, the fifth thing I miss the most from my youth is ""morning wood.""That's right, I said it aloud.The ""erection,"" ""boner,""""stiffy,"" ""chubby,"" ""woody"" or whatever you call it that I used to get all the time when I was younger.But it's true. I have come to notice over the past few years that my ""little dancing friend"" doesn't show up as often in the mornings.As a youngster, I grew accustomed to lying in bed a few extra minutes waiting for the blood to rush back to my ""other"" head. Now, not so much.I really miss this.The morning erection, or as the scientific community refers to it ""nocturnal penile tumescence"" has always ""stood"" as a ""big"" symbol of my manhood. My research shows that I am definitely not the only man concerned about it. But, my objective here today is not to construct a complete scientific explanation of the physical and psychological causes of this phenomenon. There have been plenty of expert and not-so-expert studies on why men experience erections when they wake but nothing conclusive has yet to be proven.Some researchers say it is caused by having a full bladder and the dire need to urinate after a long night sleep. That makes sense.Since I often find myself doing the ""nighttime tango"" multiple times during the night, it's only logical that I wouldn't wake up erect with a penis full of pee pee.Other's seem to think that men experience a series of multiple nighttime erections due to vivid, lifelike dreams and that we wake up ""standing tall ""b on the tail end of one of those dreams.I can relate to this, too.In my younger days, I had re-occurring dreams that were incredibly animated, graphic and sexy.I would often find myself floating effortlessly; face up on a smooth flowing stream under a canopy of naked women. Kind of like the erotic dream sequence in the classic movie  ""The Big Lebowski.""Or at other times my dreams involved large groups of nubile participants on beaches or warm pastures frolicking with each other in pairs and triplets and groups.And these dreams involved friends and neighbors and women I met on the street and my high school math teacher, Ms. French.But I digress. I don't think my dreams nowadays are as provocative. Unfortunately, most of the time I am dreaming about work, things I need to do or the next day's blog topic.However, I can tell you that ""morning wood"" is perfectly normal, natural and common throughout the male kingdom.If you are not experiencing it on a regular basis anymore, there are hundreds of expert and scientific websites with intricate explanations of how and why the issue arises for you to research if you are interested.My goal today is just to point out the angst I feel because this is no longer a daily event. My ""morning wood"" was like an old friend.I really do miss it and even more than I miss the other four ""things"" we discussed earlier in my blogs.It is unfortunate that we have all taken these ""things"" for granted in our youth.I don't know about you, but I hate the fact that I have to grow physically old. There's no stopping it.So, why not fight to keep what you got and enjoy every minute like it's your last?I pose this challenge to each and every Baby Boomer that is reading this blog: Tomorrow, we should all throw away our reading glasses, get drunk and play some baseball, football or something; eat a couple of hot dogs loaded with chili and onions and cucumbers; and go to bed dreaming about having sex with Sophia Vergara (for the women, that would be George Clooney or Brad Pitt).The hell with missing things from our youth.Hopefully, tomorrow morning the sun will rise right along with your ""morning wood."""

Marketing is an essential part of doing business. Unless you increase your brand's visibility and raise customer awareness, you'll never gain enough momentum to build a recurring stream of revenue. But in order to be successful in marketing, you need to yield a positive ROI, and all too often these seven fatal mistakes get in the way:1. Not Putting the Brand First. Your brand is your company's core identity, and if it isn't at the heart of your campaign, you're doing yourself a disservice. 2. Not Doing the Research. While some of the most successful marketing campaigns have been built on intuition and inspiration, the most practical ones have been built on raw data. Do the research up front to know what you're getting into. 3. Targeting the Wrong Audience. Know exactly who your audience is and create advertising and messaging that truly speaks to them. Get the audience wrong, and your campaign won't stand a chance. 4. Putting All Your Eggs in One Basket. It's a cliché, but it's a popular phrase for a reason. In marketing, there are no guarantees--even if the data supports the success of your campaign, random factors can interfere with your results. It's best to pursue multiple strategies across multiple channels, hedging your bets against the worst-case scenarios. 5. Failing to Proofread. This may seem like a small misstep, but in the wrong context it can ruin your brand's reputation. Countless major brands have tweeted with an inappropriate hashtag, circulated an unintentionally offensive ad, or grossly misspelled a word in a major publication--and the events are catastrophic. 6. Forgetting to Measure. Without data, you'll never know whether your campaign was successful. Forgetting to set up tracking and analytics means you've essentially stripped your campaign of any objective value--and you've forgone the ability to learn a lesson from your approach. 7. Not Making Adjustments. Nobody is successful in marketing immediately. Only through an ongoing process of revision and improvement can you eventually find a selection of strategies that work for you. Be sure to avoid these mistakes at all costs when planning your first few marketing campaigns. With experience, you'll gain a feel for the right way to do things, and you'll be able to improve on your previous efforts. In the meantime, focus on what's in front of you and avoid these critical pitfalls.

2,HEALTHY LIVING,A Slice of Nutrition,"Gina Keatley, ContributorDietitian and television host",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healthy-pizza_b_7181170.html,"Pizza, like all great foods, can be nutritious if we choose for it to be healthful. With a few small modifications both to nutrition and lifestyle, we truly can transform the menu with all of the passion and none of the pounds.",2015-05-18,2015-04-30-1430406613-3624220-GinaKeatley_Pizza.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-30-1430406613-3624220-GinaKeatley_Pizza-thumb.jpg,"Get ready people -- the pizza takeover is about to begin. As a dietitian and foodie in NYC, I tend to see the waves of food trends crest from tiny shops in Bushwick, Brooklyn to large corporate restaurants all over the country. Luckily this next wave is one of America's cheesy favorites and, believe it or not, it can be a part of a healthy diet. Pizza itself can be a great base for fresh and healthy ingredients. Like all things in nutrition, it's about choice. In fact, we know Italians love their pizza but tend to have a lower BMI than most Americans. According to the World Health Organization, Italy has 23 percent less obesity than the United States. When we look at nutritional breakdowns of pizza from national chains here in the States, we can see that pizza has a broad scope, from a whopping 1,705 calories and 115 grams of fat for half of a regular-sized deep dish Chicago Classic from Uno Pizzeria and Grill, to roasted artichoke and spinach pizza with chicken from California Pizza Kitchen with a more manageable 625 calories and 22 grams of fat for half a pie. So, here are three things you can do to keep your pies on the nourishing side:1. Make it a meal by adding lean protein and vegetables. This is by far my favorite rule for all food, not just pizza. When you are ordering your pizza, remember to add fiber and protein to each slice. As always, chose lower saturated-fat meats. According to the American Heart Association, eating foods that contain saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in your blood. High levels of LDL cholesterol in your blood increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. That means you should try lean(er) proteins like sliced chicken breast or even Canadian bacon over regular bacon to cut your fat by 60 percent. Then add complex carbohydrates like spinach. Luckily for you, a large part of this new pie revival is that restaurants will be offering tons of topping options.2. Think Thin. Choosing thin crust can cut off tons of carbohydrates and calories from your menu. Additionally, eating the thinner slices can actually make you feel fuller because we perceive the felling of quantity to being satisfied with the meal. Having three thin slices may make you feel as satiated as one large slice. 3. Memories and Moderation. Make pizza meals fun and special but eat it in moderation. Most of us remember pizza parties from our youth or a great first date that started over a piping hot pie. These memories are special not just because of the food, but also the company. Head out for a pie no more then a few times a month and try not to mindlessly grab a slice between errands. Sit down, eat, and give the pie the time and respect this mouthwatering meal really deserves. Pizza, like all great foods, can be nutritious if we choose for it to be healthful. With a few small modifications both to nutrition and lifestyle, we truly can transform the menu with all of the passion and none of the pounds."

Her cancer was detected via routine mammogram. Twenty years ago, it's unlikely Lee would have announced her diagnosis and surgery, or knew to get annual mammograms. Thanks to the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Breast Cancer Walks, the pink ribbon and free mammograms, breast cancer awareness has reached mass proliferation. This week, to coincide with National Women's Lung Health Week, the American Lung Association's Lung Force initiative is raising awareness about an even bigger, deadlier health concern for women. Lung cancer is the number one killer of women. Twice as many women die of lung cancer than all other cancers, and yet only one percent of women have this disease on their radar. The long-held belief is that only smokers get lung cancer and that getting sick is just a consequence of that choice. Not true. Two-thirds of new cases are in women who quit many years or never smoked. Valerie Harper is among them. She was diagnosed with the disease in 2009, and had surgery to remove a two centimeter tumor in her lung. She went public with her condition in 2013 when a recurrence appeared in the meninges membrane around her brain. Her oncologists gave her three months to live. Harper decided to use what time she had left to share her story and raise awareness about lung cancer. Two years and four months later, she's still doing the good work.Harper spoke about her cancer fight at a Lung Force event in New York City yesterday. She looks fabulous and told the audience she feels great. Tarceva is keeping her disease at bay. During a panel discussion, she was vibrant and laughing, full of energy and warmth. You'd never think this seventy-six year old has cancer. After the event, we talked about her health and goals. VF: Breast cancer uses a pink ribbon. Lung Force uses a turquoise swirl. Why? VH: Turquoise is the color of air, of breath. The swirl is like the movement of air. We want people to breath freely, and to blow away cancer. More women are dying of the disease than all other cancers, including breast. How were you originally diagnosed? I needed an operation on my wrist, but before they let me on the table, they said, ""You have to get a chest X-ray."" When my doctor saw it, he said, ""It could be nothing. I could be something horrible."" I was shown the X-ray and saw a little round moon on the top lobe of my lung. I thought, What are you doing there? I had surgery and that was it. No chemo, no radiation. Four years later, I was at rehearsal one day, and I got a headache and couldn't remember my lines. It felt like Novocain on my head. It turned out to be a tumor in the meninges, a recurrence of the original cancer. People have asked me, ""Aren't you mad at your doctor for not doing chemo the first time?"" I'm not. I was cancer free for four years and I'm doing fine now. I do yoga and get acupuncture. I listen to my brilliant doctors. I've been lucky.Had you been getting regular scans?Yes! The initial lung X-ray saved my life. Since then, I get scanned every six months. That the tumor turned up in my meninges was totally random. I think everyone, rich or poor, with insurance or without, should get scanned. The importance of annual mammograms is ingrained. People should think the same way about annual lung screenings. Use your intuition. If you feel something isn't right, get checked.According to the American Lung Association, a woman dies of lung cancer every eight minutes. In 2015, 71,000 U.S. woman will die of the disease. It's almost an epidemic. I think it's due to the environment. Poor eating habits, not exercising enough. There's also a genetic factor. I never smoked and I got it. My mother never smoked and she died of it. My mother was diagnosed in her seventies, around the same age I was.There are breast cancer genes, and colon cancer genes . . . It's entirely possible there's a lung cancer gene, too. We need more money for research to find out. That's the goal of the Lung Force campaign. Also to spread the word far and wide, coast to coast, so awareness is as common as pizza. Women are dying in alarming number but only one percent are concerned. We can't let this be. No one deserves cancer. If anyone tries to blame a patient for getting sick, screw them. Stigmatizing an illness keeps people and organizations from donating to find a cure. All three of my mothers had lung cancer. My mother, my father's wife Angelica, and Nancy Walker, Rhoda's mother. I've been surrounded by it. I realized the other day that I should have been getting screenings earlier. I should have known better. But people are ashamed and afraid to talk about lung cancer. That has to change.

Along with co-chef Nick Balla, the pair has garnered all sorts of critical acclaim for melding the food of Balla's Hungarian ancestry with ingredients and techniques from a mishmash of other cultures, from Asia to Scandinavia. She was in New York recently and stopped by the Epicurious Test Kitchen to do a little cooking from her and Balla's new book, Bar Tartine: Techniques & Recipes.""I don't know the last time I've made French Onion dip,"" says Burns. ""But it's the first thing that popped into my head when we were talking.""What we'd been talking about is the many flavored powders Bar Tartine delves into--stuff like making powders out of yogurt, burnt bread, and rice. It's the kind of stuff a high-end restaurant like Bar Tartine is built upon, but not something home cooks get into very often. But when we were talking, Burns suggested garlic and onion powder. Which, truthfully, I avoid. While it can be a potent flavor bomb, the store-bought stuff is doctored up with preservatives, extra salt, and artificial additives. Burns assured me that trying homemade garlic and onion powders would convert me: ""They're just so concentrated in flavor, a little bit sweet, and incredibly versatile--you can fold them into breads, use them in marinades, or just about anything else.""And, as it turns out, they make for one hell of a dip.Luckily, making your own garlic and onion powders is a heck of a lot easier than it sounds. Sure, you could use a dehydrator to do it, but there's an easier way--one with zero special equipment necessary. All you need is a gas oven. Don't turn it on, don't even look at it--the warmth of your oven's pilot light is enough to do the trick. The key to killer at-home powders is doing absolutely nothing. Photo: Chelsea KyleStart by prepping the green onions and garlic. For the green onions, trim the roots and halve the onions lengthwise from the white bottom all the way to the green top. Cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces and cook in a cast iron skillet over high heat until charred and blackened, about 10 minutes. For the garlic, peel the cloves, remove the hard stem end, and cut into very thin slices.From there, the process is the same for either powder: Place the ingredients on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper and leave it in a gas oven overnight. After 12 hours, remove the tray from the oven and grind the large dried pieces in a food processor to coarse flakes. Move the flakes back to a parchment-lined sheet tray and place in the oven for 8 more hours, until all the moisture is dried out. Process the results in a spice grinder and pass the powder through a fine mesh sieve.That's it. Active time where you're actually doing something? Oh, maybe 15 minutes.Don't have a gas oven? No problem, you've still got options. Of course, there's always a food dehydrator (set it to 125°F and follow the same time guidelines above). Following the same process with an electric oven set to its lowest setting (ideally below 170 °F) and the door ajar works well too.With the super-concentrated flavor of garlic and charred green onions at your finger tips, assembling the best ever French onion dip is a breeze. Burns turns to rich, creamy ricotta cheese over the more conventional mayo for a dip that packs a lighter mouthfeel. Combine 1 1/2 cups high-quality ricotta cheese and sour cream with 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives, 1 cup caramelized onions, 2 tbsp charred green onion powder, 2 tbsp garlic powder, and 2 tbsp sweet paprika. Fold with a rubber spatula until fully incorporated. Photo: Chelsea KyleThe resulting dip tastes nothing like the stuff you had growing up as a kid. It's rich, creamy, slightly sweet, a little bit salty, and full of multi-layered, big flavors. And it's all because we put a few ingredients in an oven. ""It's one of those simple things that sounds complicated at first,"" explains Burns, ""but then you do it and you realize, oh wait, this is the easiest thing ever.""The hardest thing ever?

Process the results in a spice grinder and pass the powder through a fine mesh sieve.That's it. Active time where you're actually doing something? Oh, maybe 15 minutes.Don't have a gas oven? No problem, you've still got options. Of course, there's always a food dehydrator (set it to 125°F and follow the same time guidelines above). Following the same process with an electric oven set to its lowest setting (ideally below 170 °F) and the door ajar works well too.With the super-concentrated flavor of garlic and charred green onions at your finger tips, assembling the best ever French onion dip is a breeze. Burns turns to rich, creamy ricotta cheese over the more conventional mayo for a dip that packs a lighter mouthfeel. Combine 1 1/2 cups high-quality ricotta cheese and sour cream with 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives, 1 cup caramelized onions, 2 tbsp charred green onion powder, 2 tbsp garlic powder, and 2 tbsp sweet paprika. Fold with a rubber spatula until fully incorporated. Photo: Chelsea KyleThe resulting dip tastes nothing like the stuff you had growing up as a kid. It's rich, creamy, slightly sweet, a little bit salty, and full of multi-layered, big flavors. And it's all because we put a few ingredients in an oven.

Jeffrey refers to it as ""minding your own business."" Hayzlett is also a top rated international keynote speaker, a best-selling author and a regular contributor on Bloomberg TV. He is the former Chief Marketing Officer of Eastman Kodak and today is the Chairman of the C-Suite Network, the world's most powerful network of C-Suite leaders. Jeffrey has a massive amount of experience minding businesses...his own and others. He's the kind of guy that makes you feel lazy no matter what you've accomplished in life. Hard working...yup! Tough as nails... you bet! A fearless risk taker... no question! If you want to build an empire, this is the guy that knows how to build it from ground up. Here are 6 lessons to minding your own business the Jeffrey Hayzlett way:Move to Where the Food Is:  Jeffrey Hayzlett is a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. He divides his time between Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where he lives on a ranch and enjoys riding his horses, and New York City where he builds empires by day and networks with celebrities and the Manhattan business affluent by night. How did a cowboy like Hayzlett end up in The Big Apple? ""You must move to where the food is,"" said Hayzlett. Hayzlett says that when you have massive dreams you need to figure out where it is you need to be to build accomplish them. He wanted to have a business TV show and needed it be in New York City to make that happen. It took three years to pitch and develop, C-Suite with Jeffrey Hayzlett, to networks. As much as he loves Sioux Falls, he realized that building a strong television program was going to be all but impossible to do from there. Success required that he uproot and move to where the food is, NYC. Fire Fast:  I asked Jeffrey what it's like managing so many people both in his current businesses and when he was leading the marketing team at Eastman Kodak. Jeffrey said the key to managing people is in making sure the employees know what the conditions of satisfaction are to successfully carry out their role in the company. In other words, if the employee is clear as to what success looks like within their job, then they will know when they are not cutting it. As far as firing people, Hayzlett said that no business owner has ever made the mistake of letting someone go too soon. Furthermore, he says that the point in which you should let an employee go is right when you first suspect it. When you feel in your gut that an employee is not the right fit, it's time to move on.What Would The Big Dogs Do?:  Hayzlett lives by a simple motto, ""If you want to run with the big dogs, you need to learn to piss in the tall grass."" The problem with most business owners and entrepreneurs as Jeffrey sees it is that they think too small. They have self-imposed limiting beliefs about what their possibilities are, and they are forever confined by those beliefs. Hayzlett constantly re-examines his personal goals and the goals of each of his companies to determine if he's thinking too small. As well, he surrounds himself with a team who is unafraid to call him out when they see that he's missing out on reaching for something bigger or seizing an opportunity that he has missed. Big thinking takes practice but it's the foundation of all the biggest empires in the world. Big Risks - No Regrets: When asked what his biggest regrets were in life, Hayzlett says he has none. This is one of the benefits of being a major risk taker. Hayzlett has taken massive risks in his career. Such risks lead him to his position as Chief Marketing Officer of a Fortune 100 company, Eastman Kodak, in 2006 and those same risk taking proclivities lead him to resign in 2009, at 49 years old, so that he could pursue some of his own massive career goals, all of which are coming to fruition. Hayzlett says that when things start to get comfortable, they are also becoming stagnant. Therefore he pushes himself constantly to get outside his comfort zone and to take risks that the outside world may see as unreasonable. In business, says Hayzlett, greatness is in doing things that nobody else has the guts to do. The upside of taking such risks is that he lives a ""No Regrets"" life. He says that most people have some regrets because they don't take the risks required to go after their big dreams, but for Hayzlett, he will always bet on himself. He will always take the risk knowing that he will absolutely land on his feet and in a position that is far superior than the one he was in before taking the leap.Stupid Business Rules: One of Hayzlett's pet peeves is when he comes across really stupid business rules. He says when he runs across a stupid rule it forces him to re-evaluate his own business systems to see if there are any really useless processes that he's overlooked because sometimes there are opportunities hidden within those stupid rules. For example, Hayzlett talked about how he recently had a business meeting at a local restaurant. He arrived before his guest. The restaurant had a rule in which he couldn't be seated until the guest arrived. As a master empire builder, Hayzlett said to himself, ""How stupid is that?"" If they had seated him he would have ordered a drink, which would have grossed up the cost of the dinner. Instead, they made him wait. When his guest arrived, he decided to take the meeting to another restaurant. The lesson, says Hayzlett, is to re-evaluate your own business and make sure there are no stupid, archaic, un-opportunistic rules that are costing you money and customers.What the Hell did I Hire You For?:  Take authority. Take initiative. Whether you are an employee serving your company or a business serving a client, be willing to have authority and take initiative. Jeffrey shared a story about an employee at his firm. As they were preparing for a big meeting she came to Jeffrey and asked him if she should replace her black and white copies of their marketing materials with colored copies. Jeffrey asked the girl, ""If you could only ask me 10 questions a month in the course of working here, would that be one of your questions?"" The girl said, no, that she'd make sure the questions were important ones. This is the point that Jeffrey was trying to explain to his employee. He said to himself, ""What the hell did I hire you for if I'm going to have to make the decision anyway?""  Whether you are building a career, a small business, or a massive empire, success favors those who make decisions and own them.I've interviewed hundreds of empire builders in my quest to build my own massive real estate empire, including the likes of Barbara Corcoran, Robin Roberts, and Darren Hardy...but none of them were quite like Jeffrey Hayzlett. He's the Napoleon Hill of the 21st Century, with a twist. Not only is he meeting and interviewing the biggest and best business leaders in the world, he is one. He's in the trenches building massive empires while visiting the trenches of other leaders who are doing the same. The best part for entrepreneurs like me is that he's curating the content that he learns and sharing it with the world so that we can all become better at minding our own business.Learn more about Jeffrey Hayzlett at www.hayzlett.com."

Hebert/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b8fc2600003500827018.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I never saw B.B. King perform live or ever met him in person, yet I carry with me a lesson that he taught me many years ago.Fifteen years back, I was both freaked out and flattered, stepping out of my car onto the red carpet and into the press gauntlet for that year's Grammys. As strange, wonderful and rare such experiences are for we ""less grand"" artists, it was a moment that crept into my confidence and left me saying: ""Yes, I have and can accomplish great things."" From that moment on I would be forever tagged as ""Grammy-nominated"" and that's a pretty cool thing. For a moment in time, I got to be in, around and have my name in the mix of some the most widely recognizable names in the history of music. That year, U2 delivered ""Beautiful Day"", Eminem and Elton John shared the stage together, and Madonna schooled us all about what it means to be a modern day pop star. It was overwhelming to witness, to be able to pretend I was a peer in some weird way, but I couldn't help but recognize that I was obviously not whatever they were.Nominated, as I was, for a Christian record, my portion of the ceremonies were off-camera, during the light of day, and celebrated with much less enthusiasm than that of the televised broadcast. There are the much less sexy categories like Christian contemporary, spoken word and jazz that are recognized before the real party begins. After getting all gussied up, walking the red carpet, then sitting in the rafters of the Staples Center both fearing and praying of what might happen if my name was called I experienced a bit of a let down coming to understanding my place in the world. Compared to all that I saw around me, I was simple, far from grand, and was left feeling decidedly not special. Even if I had picked up a golden gramophone, I still think I would have been just as humbled. While I was sitting in one of the most expensive dresses I had ever worn and starting to wonder why I bothered... B.B. King's name was called (pre-telecast) to receive one of the 15 Grammys he would amass over the course of his storied career. One could argue that it would have been acceptable for an old man to send someone in his stead, but he came, sat through all the drooling madness of aspirational stardom and accepted his distinction. His seats were better than mine, but still he had a long way to walk up to the stage and give his speech. Here was a man, who none could debate, was and forever will be among the historical figures of modern American music and yet, there was little more than the momentary applause and another a small statue. There was little grandeur, just a token of appreciation, leaving me to wonder if he spent any time grumbling about having to brave the circus event or if he held any enthusiasm for gaining the recognition yet again. He'd done this more times than any Madonna or Eminem will most likely ever do. I thought, in comparing his achievements to those in the coming broadcast, if any of those artists even held a candle to this man in terms of talent, or whatever measure of judgment I could think up. To my reckoning, it was B.B. King who deserved the prime time lights and celebration. Yet, he was there, in the pre-broadcast, stuck with the likes of aspiring artists and hundreds of also-rans like myself who wrestled with conflicting feelings of admiration and disappointment. Despite any indignity or slight I might have imagined he could have rightly experienced, he seemed secure in his own skin. He accepted his award with dignity and honor, behaving very much as the man one hopes he would be -- soulful, humble and the embodiment of an extraordinary artist who has revealed life through music.He accepted his award with a quiet pride Kanye West could hardly dream of. He was applauded and deeply appreciated by all, but his reception would be nothing like the coming spectacle. He was unhurried, humble and yet grateful. His speech, though unremarkable in terms of being quotable, gave me a glimpse into a talented man who was more servant than an entrepreneur. His presence and his contributions, though world-changing, are astonishing not merely because of his talent, but because of the humility and earnestness at which he embraced the journey he was called to. For whatever achievements he might be credited, his life seemed to be the act of living the experience rather than accomplishing some sort of musical world domination.Throughout all of my Grammy experience, I was left feeling shaken. If the award couldn't be the measure of talent or if recognition isn't the mark of success, what then was I after? What was the point of my playing, creating or any career ambition knowing that even B.B. King, in all his greatness, is still just a man, who, at best, on occasion was thanked for his work?I find myself, many years later, reminded, thanks to B.B., that it's not the awards that I should aspire to, but rather prepare myself for a life of gratitude. The pursuit of any of our callings and the willingness to share our unique gifts with the world will never be fully satisfied by a trophy or a spotlight, but, perhaps upon occasion make for legendary moments all the same. If we are ever lucky enough to find our passions and be safely surrendered to them, may we all be so blessed by recognizing what a gift it is to know that we have received it. What B.B. taught me is that it is not so much talent that lifts us up, but rather it is the story of our ""inner man"" and character that ultimately defines us.Thank you B.B. It's not a Grammy, but sincerely, thank you for showing up that weird day and encouraging me from so far away. Thank you for having lived an example of what I hope at the end of my days will be: having pursued my own calling with abandon, honor and excellence.R.I.P. Mr. King"

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdc2f250000320037fd93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If Dana Beyer's refusal to acknowledge Utah's recently passed nondiscrimination protections as progress for the LGBT movement is any indication, our nation's path toward the balance of religious liberty and freedom for LGBT Americans is going to be unnecessarily drawn out and hard fought.In her Huffington Post piece, ""The 'Utah Compromise' as Seen After the Indiana Tipping Point,"" (4/20/15), Beyer argues that Utah's S.B. 296, which bans discrimination against gay and transgender Utahns in employment and housing, should not be used as a model for the rest of the country because: (a) Utah is unique, and (b) the exemptions in S.B. 296 are too broad. As a sponsor of this legislation, I was proud to see it pass the state legislature with resounding Republican support, and I would like to point out how Beyer misses the extraordinary respect, compromise and good will it took from those on both sides of the issue to see this historic accomplishment through in Utah.In her piece, Beyer says that my home state of Utah is ""a unique entity,"" and I can agree with her there. But Beyer neglects to point out something that I think makes Utah especially unique: Utah is now the only red state to offer employment and housing protections to LGBT individuals. Instead, Beyer chooses to focus on Utah's robust religious protections, which reflect the unique religious makeup of our state (about three-fifths of Utahns are Mormon).Every state in our union grapples with issues -- including LGBT freedom and religious liberty -- flavored by that state's unique historical, political, religious and demographic contexts. Quite often, state legislatures look to other states (yes, even Utah) for solutions. It would be a mistake for national LGBT advocates to dismiss the respectful compromise that allowed one of the most conservative states in the country to become only the 19th state in the country to adopt trans-inclusive LGBT protections.If doubters need a measuring stick to gauge how far we were able to move the conversation among conservatives in Utah, compare our approach to that of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who in his recent New York Times op-ed, ""Bobby Jindal: I'm Holding Firm Against Gay Marriage,"" (4/23/15), slammed Indiana and Arkansas for cowering ""to the shrieks of big business and the radical left,"" once the consequences of their religious freedom laws garnered national attention.The narrative playing out in the media and in state capitals across the country is that LGBT freedom advances only at the detriment of religious liberties, and vice versa. That doesn't have to be the case. By bringing both sides together with mutual respect and willingness to compromise, we were able to move Utah in the right direction while so many other red states were taking a giant step back. If that's not a model for the rest of the nation, then I don't know what is.Religion informs the beliefs and actions of most Americans -- as well as the votes of their legislators. For many, continued protection of their religious liberties is every bit as important as marriage and nondiscrimination rights are to the LGBT community. If LGBT advocates meet attempts to craft religious exemptions with a stubborn insistence on purity, rather than progress, the Governor Jindals of the world will be handed the culture war that they seek, progress on LGBT rights will be stalled, and those on the right who would like to impede the advancement of LGBT freedom will continue to win, especially in deep red states. A better approach -- the Utah approach -- is for LGBT and religious advocates to reason together, rather than war against each other. The Utah Compromise will instruct participants to (1) agree to advance LGBT rights and religious liberties simultaneously, (2) agree to take a step forward, no matter how small, to get the ball rolling, (3) agree that each party will correct misrepresentations from their side of the issue (which is why I'm addressing Dana Beyer's argument that Utah's historic step just wasn't big enough), (4) agree that all citizens are equal under the law, and (5) agree that some disputes already are resolved.I'm proud of the progress we made in Utah. We destroyed the false dichotomy that LGBT rights and religious liberties are adverse; we saw these two important issues advance together. No longer will Pastor Drew Reese, a military veteran with PTSD, face eviction just for being gay. No longer will Eric Moutsos, a motorcycle cop and devout Christian, risk losing his job for declining to celebrate gay pride. Utah was unique in doing this. It is a path to victory, peace and progress that other red states should follow."

Staab/CBS via Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b8fc1f000039012428fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dropping various objects off of buildings as high as the sky is tall just might be the very definition of stupid.But it's so much fun, too.Ever witnessed a melon explode into a million pieces, dropped onto the concrete sidewalk from a balcony several stories above ground? The sound is spectacular. Unique even. Like Johnny Cash's singing. Or Prince Charles' ears. But the mushroom cloud of red and green watermelon bits -- interspersed by speckled black seeds -- that creates a radial symmetry of organic beauty is something only Van Gogh or Picasso could dream up. It's perhaps the first real example of sidewalk art. Take that buskers!David Letterman taught me that. I know, most of you might think it's an immature, disrespectful and utterly foolish act to drop items off of a roof or balcony, solely for entertainment purposes.And you're probably right. In hindsight, it is rather dumb.And that's how many of you will remember David Letterman. He was Late Night's buffoon. He was ""that guy"" who used to drop buckets of paint, oversized rocks, or televisions off the roofs of various New York building to see what might happen. He adorned a velcro suit, hurled himself onto a wall to see if he might stick. He terrorized patrons at fast food restaurant drive-thrus just to make fun of their orders. You thought he was obnoxious. ""What an idiot,"" you may have muttered when hearing of his antics. You vouched never to watch him again.He was ""that guy"" who might otherwise have been coined a curmudgeon. Cantankerous, perhaps. You had heard of the way he interacted and interviewed some of his guests. ""Why is he so mad,"" you asked a friend. Dave had an edge, for certain. In fact, it was his sharp, intense and at times pointed questioning and conversations that also sent you fleeing for the remote control. Just ask Paris Hilton. ""I like the other guy,"" you exclaimed to your spouse. ""You know, the friendlier one with the big chin.""He was ""that guy"" who rather famously -- or should it be infamously -- started off the 1995 Oscars telecast with the Oprah-Uma joke. I found it hilarious, but they didn't.But ""that guy"" -- in his final week as a late night television host -- deserves more than your scorn and scrapheap castoff. I'm here to say ""Thank You, David Letterman."" More importantly perhaps, I want you (David) to know how much I've learned from you over the many years of watching your late night zaniness.1) Self-DeprecationOver the course of 6,028 shows and interviews with some 19,932 guests, you never once made it about ""David Letterman."" In fact, the most enduring and endearing characteristic was an unending swarm of self-deprecation. Whether for the show itself, or your own self-described foibles and idiosyncrasies, the predominant portion of guests were put at ease by your goof-ball, aw shucks, I'm an idiot demeanor. This sort of behavior puts people at ease. I've learned to use a self-deprecating style in many of my interactions, most notably as a leader of people.2) HonestyThere's a certain element to being a late night television talk show host where honesty is expected. It's not as though you could have lied about attending the Department of Radio and Television at Ball State University. But when you opened up to a live audience (and millions of viewers on television) about extortion attempts and acts of infidelity, well ... that's about as honest as things can get. In the same vain, you never faked your way through an interview or comedy bit. If the guest wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer -- hello Justin Bieber -- you wouldn't mince words, nor play down to their lack of intelligence. You were honest, you remained you, and that's how I learned to remain comfortable in my own skin.3) Public LoveAlthough I'm 25 years younger than you, we had our first child at the same time. You're a late night television talk show host. I'm not. But that didn't stop you from demonstrating how proud you were -- how much love you had developed -- when your son, Harry, was born. Subsequently, Harry's name, pictures and even appearances on the show surfaced over the years. It was PDAs (public displays of affection) non-stop. The best? Publicly quizzing your guests on parenthood tips, so you could become a better parent. (At least that's how you masked the questions.) The public affection you showed for your precious mother was also infectious. As a result, I've learned not to be afraid to say in public, ""I love my kids and wife and family.""4) Involving OthersI feel as though you might have been a part of the 'math club' or some other high school team that often (and inappropriately) gets made fun of during the teenage years. Your penchant for involving others -- particularly the regular people of society -- was first-class. Stagehands like Biff, Pat, Kenny, Tony and Harold always had a role to play on your shows. In the neighbouring community, you'd involve 'normal' citizens like Rupert, Mujibur or Sirajul as part of the show. I learned that community is important, and much like in sports it's the crest on the front not the name on the back that we all play for.5) SincerityYou ran a comedy show. That didn't stop you from being sincere. You presented flowers for Julia Roberts and other guests. You showed deep concern for peace when discussing political and worldly issues with former or current Presidents and elected officials. After 9/11 -- arguably your sincerest shows ever -- you were the capstone of emotional unity. When you returned from quintuple bypass heart surgery, you invited the doctors and nurses that both saved your life, and took care of your recovery. You taught me to never forget those that assist you in life.I'm 43 years old, and am blessed to have ""married up"", now co-parenting a 12-, 10- and 8-year-old. I met you -- David Letterman -- well before I ever met my infinitely better half. I've known you for more than half of my life, and through this one-sided relationship, I've learned to laugh, love, loathe, lead and live.We'll never meet. But I wanted you to know that although I was only one of the millions of people who learned from your zaniness and your love of life, it has meant a great deal to many of us.Thank you, David Letterman.Your only mistake? You really should have dropped Howard Stern off of those buildings instead of the melons. In fact, you picked the wrong melon."

Being mindful of the way our lifestyle choices at home impact habitat and wildlife is a great first step. Reducing water use, limiting the use of pesticides and herbicides in our yards, limiting our use of plastics, and making every effort to recycle as much of our household waste stream as possible are just some of the small but meaningful changes we can make in our day-to-day lives. Together our small steps can make great strides, and our collective efforts can result in reduced pressure on threatened habitats and endangered species. Microbeads, the tiny plastics found in beauty products and toothpaste, harm the environment.

Look for ways to join and encourage those efforts on the job: join your company's green team, suggest new products or processes that are better for the environment, participate in company-wide recycling efforts and programs. I feel fortunate to be working at the Wildlife Conservation Society's New York Aquarium because we are involved directly in work with endangered species around the globe and right here in the waters of New York. Our local waterways help generate oxygen and regulate climate and the health of these waters is intimately tied to the health of our city. Scientists at the aquarium work tirelessly to understand the ecosystems in our seascape.  A blue shark in the Atlantic Ocean being tagged by New York Aquarium scientists. Photo by Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.As an example, our work with sand tiger sharks and other fishes and marine mammals allows us to understand the way coastal species use the complex habitats of bays, nearshore areas, and open water during various seasons and life stages. This research guides us when we're working with local communities, state governments, and our partners in shipping and recreational and commercial fishing industries to minimize by-catch, maximize protection, and protect key habitats.By working with these partners, our goal is to restore healthy populations of local marine species and protect waters in and around our city. New York's waters serve as a nursery, feeding ground and migratory corridor for hundreds of species of aquatic life, many of which are threatened or endangered. The New York Bight is also home to the Hudson Canyon, an offshore submarine formation the size of the Grand Canyon, whose walls rise three-quarters of a mile from the ocean floor. We hope to work with all stakeholders from science, government, and industry on the nomination of a National Marine Sanctuary offshore from New York that will protect deep sea corals and the unique ecosystems found in this marvelous place. At the New York Aquarium's summer camp, educators offer age-appropriate experiences, including explorations of marine life on the beach and interactions with animals.

Through this program, the entire AZA-accredited zoo and aquarium community will focus their conservation science and wildlife expertise toward the goal of engaging 180 million visitors in saving species in the wild.Across the 229 AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums, there are more wildlife care experts, more animals, and a greater opportunity to engage the public than any other entity. AZA-accredited facilities have three-quarters of a million animals representing 6,000 species, with close to 1,000 of them endangered in the wild. AZA institutions are already investing over $160 million annually towards field conservation to help save animals in the wild. With the new SAFE initiative, AZA has now identified 10 priority species and is developing conservation action plans for each.  AZA SAFE: Saving Animals From Extinction will join together the 180 million annual zoo and aquarium visitors with the resources and collective expertise of AZA members and partners to save the most vulnerable wildlife species from extinction. We know that efforts to explore and educate the public about our local waterways can engage New Yorkers in their protection. For 120 years, WCS has harnessed the expertise in its zoos and aquarium with its global conservation programs in the name of saving wildlife. Now, in partnership with AZA and the SAFE initiative, we know our collective efforts will make an even bigger difference for endangered species around the world. Endangered Species Day serves as a great opportunity to observe that we are stewards of this Earth and we should do all we can to protect our magnificent wildlife - both in our lands and our seas."

And unlike the single-distance, climate-controlled environments of indoor archery, outdoor archery offers an unpredictable mix of terrain and weather at varying distances to challenge your shooting skills.Target ArcheryThe Olympic and Paralympic Games are probably the best-known example of outdoor target archery, but archers compete outdoors at everything from local to national events.Outdoor target archery offers two main competitions. Recurve archers compete at a distance of 70 meters, shooting at a 122 centimeter target face with multicolored rings. (For kids, the distances are shorter; there are opportunities for everyone to try target archery!). Compound archers shoot an 80 centimeter target face that's placed 50 meters away. Many of these tournaments end with elimination rounds that pit archers in head-to-head matchups to determine the winner.Outdoor archers face all sorts of weather-related challenges. Only lightning and tornados halt outdoor tournaments. Archers judge the wind by feel and by watching indicator socks above the targets and alongside the range. Some 144-arrow tournaments start and finish in one day, requiring archers to have enough stamina to maintain their shooting form throughout.To find outdoor target archery opportunities, visit USA Archery's events page.Paralympic archer Lee Ford knows where she prefers to shoot.

She also advises everyone to have fun!Field ArcheryPhoto Credit: World ArcheryWhen combining target archery with a hike in the woods, what do you get? Field archery. As with outdoor target shooters, field archers deal with varying terrains and weather, and shoot in varying lighting conditions. Field archers usually shoot in groups of four, and then hike a course to shoot targets at varying distances.In World Archery field tournaments, the course is ""unmarked"" on the first day of competition. Archers are expected to judge the distance and take their shots in three-arrow ends; that is, each archer shoots three times before walking to the target to score their shots. Field archers shooting World Archery events -- also called ""FITA Field events"" must develop a system for estimating distances and practice it while honing their form to prepare for tournaments. If you aren't ready for that challenge, try National Field Archery Association tournaments, where distances are marked.Heather Koehl, a U.S. field champion and 2014 Olympic team alternate, thinks field archery is special because archers connect with each other. ""Sometimes your group must wait for a target to open up, and that's when they talk, share snacks and discuss how they felt about that last target,"" she said. ""It strengthens your bonds with fellow archers.""Koehl also likes this style because she ""feels like Robin Hood out there"" as she goes through the woods from target to target, shooting great scores at varying targets. ""Field archery is never the same course, so it's always fun and exciting,"" she said.Photo Credit: World ArcheryKoehl said new field archers must work on their system for gauging distances and controlling their torso for shots that angle up or down on these demanding field courses.Photo Credits: Texas State Archery Association/Ron Carmichael; World ArcheryHunter Jackson, a compound archer and 2010 silver medalist at the World Archery Field Championships, tells new field archers that once they shoot a field tournament, other forms of archery fall short of their expectations.

Even if you don't want to hunt some day, 3-D archery provides a fun, challenging test. Dee Falks, a USA Archery coach and National Federation director of the Archery Shooters Association (ASA), said 3-D competition distances are much shorter than those for target or field archery, so it's accessible to more people. ""It's just plain fun,"" Falks said.To prepare for 3-D archery, you must practice judging distances, develop stamina to carry your equipment, and learn the scoring rings for different animal targets. Check the target manufacturer's website for photos of the different models, and carry binoculars to verify where you need to aim.Coach Falks thinks 3-D archery is special because you're shooting a course set in a natural setting. Plus, it features varied terrain and you're shooting with people you might not know. ""It provides exercise, fresh air and a chance to make new friends,"" Falks said. ""This is a family sport. A family can shoot together in the same group and enjoy a day of sporting competition or recreation.""Falks also notes that archers on a 3-D course are helpful. To start, just show up.

Well, not requires it, but that's how it's always been. And if I don't come to him, he will take a shorter nap and probably be cranky. So when he stirs, I come. I check Facebook, maybe try to write something (thank God for the Notes app on my phone), close my eyes for a bit.At this point in my life as a parent (8.5 years!), I don't really think about my parenting choices, at least not in the way I used to when my first child was a baby. I obviously err on the side of crunchy/attachment parenting. But what I do or don't do is just... whatever. Part of life. Nothing to be analyzed. It basically works, and if it doesn't, I'm too tired to question it.But it occurred to me this afternoon that there are a ton of parents out there who don't or wouldn't or simply can't spend half of naptime lying there with their children. Some are working mothers, some have other kids to be with during naptime. Some of their kids have teddy bears, pacifiers or blankets to cuddle with. Some kids just don't need as much sleep assistance as my kid does. I totally get that. Every mom and kid does what works for them.It was recently Pajama Day at my older son's school. He was supposed to come dressed in PJ's with a favorite stuffed animal. Like his brother, he never had a teddy bear or another security object.My son said, laughing, ""I guess I'd have to bring you to school that day, Mom.""He doesn't sleep in our bed anymore (yes, they do eventually stop), but we lie together each night before he falls asleep and his dad or I (usually me) stay with him until he's out.My 2-year-old requires much more of me still. Naps, all night his body next to mine. I realize this level of need, sleep interruption and closeness is not for everyone. I forget how strange it is to some people only because I have been parenting this way for so long and it feels like second nature to me.Can I tell you why I do it? Yes, it started partly because I'm lazy, and going to my babies anytime they cried was easier than figuring out a different way to soothe them. Yes, it was just my instinct to do it, and I'm pretty good about tuning out the naysayers and just doing what feels right to me.But I also do it because I'm holding on. I'm holding on to their childhoods by holding onto them. I won't hold forever. Independence comes on its own, and time with kids just keeps speeding on, whether you want it to or not. My 8-year-old barely even wants to cuddle before bed anymore. I'm lucky if I get a second of it. Before I know it, he won't even want me to lie near him. He'll just go into his room, shut the door and collapse into bed.My 2-year-old, though. He lets me hold him. He wants that. He's small enough to still curl into me. His damp head in the May night still smells a little like a baby. OK, a lot. And I just don't want to rush it. I can't. It hurts my heart to think it will end. I know it will. I'm certain of it.So, even though I sometimes get frustrated when my ""off"" time is interrupted; even though I sometimes feel touched out; even though I sometimes wish I could sleep alone, I go to him anyway. I lie there in the dark, mostly just waiting, sometimes just resting, often zoning out on my phone.I'm taking him in. I'm stopping time for a second. I'm holding on.A version of this post originally appeared on wendywisner.com.Wendy Wisner is a mom, writer, and lactation consultant (IBCLC). Follow Wendy on Facebook and Twitter."

This seemingly small change was a mammoth one in an almost-6-year-old's life.",2015-05-18,2015-05-15-1431713690-826682-mohawkeraserhead2014.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-15-1431713690-826682-mohawkeraserhead2014-thumb.jpg,"By Catherine Gigante-BrownKids are constantly being told what to do and when to do it; what to eat and how to chew (mouth closed, please!); when to go to bed; what to read... I'm a firm believer that hair should be the one thing kids have control over. Sure, it's got to be clean and not a health hazard (can you say lice?), but beyond that, the choice should be theirs.I'll never forget my mom telling me how horrified she'd been when her mother forced her to wear childish banana curls at age 13, refusing to let her get a trendy bob. Aunt Rose flew to Mom's defense and convinced my grandmother to consent to a more stylish 'do. It made all the difference. A Brooklyn version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story ""Bernice Bobs Her Hair,"" but with a happy ending.I vowed not to press that kind of coiffeur stigma onto my child.Flash back 10 years. My 5-year-old son, David, had been lobbying for a Mohawk since the previous summer. But as a brand-new kindergartener, my husband Peter and I didn't want him to begin his school years labeled as the wild boy with the wild haircut. We hoped he would forget about it, but to David, summer meant one thing: Mohawk.David was to be ring-bearer at his cousin's wedding. I saw the horror in the bride-to-be's face when she pictured a tuxed tyke with a savage haircut clashing with her gorgeous Vera Wang gown. We sagely decided to wait until after Vanessa and Louis tied the knot. Then it was straight to Bill Brooks' barbershop on Main Street in Rosendale.Although he'd buzzed heads for more than 40 years, Bill confessed that he'd never done a Mohawk before. He seriously considered the task at hand, firmly gripping David's head in his palm like a golden brown coconut. My son's hair began falling away onto his shoulders and the worn linoleum.When Bill was done, somebody else smiled back at me from the chair. Where was my angelic little son? Instead, there was a pint-sized punk rocker in his place, the tiny scar where the fetal monitor had nicked his scalp clearly visible. David had swagger. David has sass. David had a Mohawk.At first, I didn't realize the full significance of David's Mohawk, but it quickly became clear. This seemingly small change was a mammoth one in an almost-6-year-old's life -- he finally had say over something, even if it were just his own head. For David, the freedom to decide how to wear his hair was monumental. Choosing such an unconventional style was a declaration of his individuality, which was alive and well, even as a first-grader.Maybe it was my imagination, but I could swear that David was strutting around like a proud mini-peacock. He had always been an energetic kid with an irrepressible joie de vivre. Now he had a new haircut to compliment his unique personality.When a tattooed biker in McDonald's gave David a thumbs-up, my boy beamed. But the rest of the world didn't seem to agree. ""I'm going to smack you when I see you!"" my mother-in-law said when she heard about the Mohawk.""It's only hair,"" I told her. ""It'll grow back.""But few seemed to understand. At the playground, parents of ringlet-topped toddlers flashed me looks of disapproval when they saw David zipping around the jungle gym. ""How could you give your son a Mohawk?"" one even gasped, as though I was encouraging him to play with matches.""Why not?"" I shrugged. ""It's his hair.""Peter and I didn't let David get a Mohawk for the biker boys' nods or to shock soccer moms. We let him do it for himself. Long after the Mohawk was gone, one important thing would remain: the self-confidence that comes with having made an independent decision. And that tiny sliver of freedom of expression would make all the difference.Sometimes David wore his hair spiked like a cockscomb. Others, he wore it feathery like a baby chick. He wore his Mohawk to summer camp (exchanging encouraging head chucks with another older camper who sported one, too) and even to Vacation Bible School -- no judgment there.David's Mohawk said he was a free spirit, that he'd made an unconventional choice which he'd thought through, petitioned for and stood by. It told me that when my son grew up, he would be solid, distinctive and determined -- and would do just fine for himself. He was well on his way.So, it was with a twinge of regret that I said farewell to the sun-kissed fringe running down the center of David's scalp when he chose to get a more traditional school haircut that autumn. During the summer of 2005, David learned to read and taught himself to swim and to ride a two-wheeler. It was also what I fondly refer to as our Mohawk Summer. There will never be another one quite like it.Since then, David has gone long and scruffy, military-style crew cut and back to a Mohawk. There was even an unfortunate choice of a thick, brushy stripe which made Peter and me cringe, especially when David decided to keep it for his school picture. (It was secretly a relief when he had it buzzed off.) But we'll think back on his Eraserhead look in a couple of years and laugh. Hopefully.Some like it cropped. Some like it braided, bouncy, bold, free. Some boys like it shaggy, trailing past their shoulders, some girls opt for a crew cut or bright blue highlights. And you know what? It's all good.This story by Catherine Gigante-Brown first appeared at ravishly.com, an alternative news+culture women's website.

There is a real sense of sisterhood and collective-nodding amongst a supportive breastfeeding community.But occasionally, one of these articles will go viral and amid the wave of support and nodding comes The Backlash.The Backlash brings comments that are often very difficult to understand (see here for examples), but even with this confusion, it's easy to translate the prevailing message that breastfeeding is something these people would rather not have on their radar.(Note to participants of The Backlash: You may want to stop reading here.)Recently, this one comment really stuck out for me:""What? You think you're the only woman to breastfeed? Get over yourself -- you're not special!""Right.Here's the thing: For me, breastfeeding has become a part of my identity. It's an integral part of how I see myself, and, of course, it's also an integral part of how my daughter sees me. I think this portrait of Mama, which my daughter happily sketched when she was 2 years old, pretty much sums it up:You see, where there is mommy, there are breasts. And where there are breasts, there is milk.And I'm not alone -- there are countless numbers of women who feel empowered by this defining act.Before my daughter was born, I never imagined that I'd be sharing the stories and images of mothers from across the globe in a bid to unite and empower others to trust their bodies and their babies. My lactation consultant didn't think I'd make it to a week... and here I am, three years in, writing about breast milk and spreading the word that this is normal.Normal.And special.Yes, I am special. Because this is my journey, and much the same as any journey of significance -- it defines me.And sometimes on this journey, time moves quickly. Just as we've got the hang of babyhood, we're feeding walking, talking toddlers instead.And sometimes on this journey, time moves slowly... particularly in the darkness that I once termed 'night'. Because at 3 a.m., this journey can feel like climbing a mountain... it can feel like our own Everest.And still we climb, still we wake and still we feed.So, a little word to The Backlash: Breastfeeding mothers are very likely to be proud of breastfeeding their children. They have worked for it and have earned that right.Because here we stand -- at the top of our own Everest. We have faced the struggle and will not be shamed or belittled for experiencing the reward.I breastfeed my daughter. Of course I'm special. Of course it defines me. And of course my portrait includes my breasts... although the fact that my tummy button looks more like a tummy crater is an entirely different post...Like what you read?

In my head, I have fantasies of walking the streets of Berlin speaking fluently with citizens and fitting in seamlessly.Unfortunately, fluency on day seven of a new language isn't likely. In fact, I wasn't close to being fluent two months later. This fantasy I had in my head is a lot harder than I realized. I just want to get on with the speaking already.However, just as a child has to start off learning his ABCs -- I have to start off by learning the everyday grammar rules of German. Is this part sexy, not exactly. But, neither is sitting through pointless college 101-level courses.You can't build a house without a solid foundation. You can't learn a new language without learning grammar rules. You can't immediately flock to the gym without some preparation.So, let's pretend we're going back into lecture hall and this time, no sleeping through lecture.Here are the essential eight core principles to start strength training.1. Start smallWork piles up. Projects are late. Kids have numerous sport practices. Your friends need your attention. Next thing you know, you haven't made it to the gym this week.Anytime you're adding a new habit into your existing life, it's essential that you ease the habit into your life as seamlessly as possible.Take it slow and give yourself time to adjust to your new habit. The main objective at the beginning is to get into the habit of strength training. Everything else in life isn't going to slow down or vanish just because you want to start lifting weights.2. Be patientNeed to look up some random fact or spelling? Easy, pull out your phone and find the results in 15 seconds.In our instantaneous world, the concept of showing patience is almost as obsolete as the flip phone.However, strength training isn't a skill that is mastered over a day, a week, or even a month. It's a skill that requires consistent practice. Approach your strength training just as an artist approaches his paintings -- with a growth mindset, appreciation of the journey and a commitment to consistently improve their craft (think 1 percent a day).Small daily improvements leads to large results (aka the body you want) over the long haul.3. Start with bodyweight movementsWhen it comes time to buy a house -- you wouldn't buy one without a sturdy foundation. You wouldn't go to a surgeon who hasn't went to medical school.Building a foundation is essential before moving on to anything else. Your body is no different with strength training.Practicing bodyweight exercises before attempting weighted movements allows you to learn the basic biomechanics of how your body moves and feels.Practicing with bodyweight movements allows you to fail and experiment in a safer setting. It's better to squat poorly using your own bodyweight than to have 100 pounds on your back while squatting poorly.4. Think compound movements over isolation movementsThe majority of individuals don't have hours to waste in the gym, therefore exercise selection needs to be precise.Compound exercises such as squats, dead lifts, chin ups, and hip thrust are going to work multiple muscle groups simultaneously while creating a greater metabolic response (aka helping burn calories) within the body than isolation exercises such as bicep curls, tricep kick backs, and the hip abductor machine.Not only are compound exercises saving time, but you're positively affecting hormones, improving joint stability, and improving your cardiovascular system.5. Focus on getting strongerIf you're a guy or gal who wants to add some lean muscle, working out with the goal of increasing your strength should be the main priority initially.Lifting with light reps for an endless amount of sets isn't going to build the body you want. Lifting challenging weights is the catalyst to shaping our bodies up and provides a solid foundation to workout from.It might be frightening initially for women to be told to lift more challenging weights, but women don't carry enough of the hormone testosterone to build muscles as us men.Besides improved stability, pain management, and bone health (preventing osteoporosis), lifting challenging weights is a stress relief and feels empowering.6. Think quality over quantityLifting for marathon sessions that exceed an hour aren't better than lifting for only 30-40 minutes. Eventually, you run into the law of diminishing returns.Think quality of exercise selections over quantity of exercises selected. A full body workout consisting of compound lifts for 30 minutes trumps a 90-minute workout that is filled with isolation exercises and long rest periods.Get in and get out should be your motto.7. Prioritize form above everything elseLifting challenging weights is encouraged, but that doesn't mean you lift the weights up by any means necessary. In addition to increasing your chances of injury, lifting with bad form teaches you bad habits and doesn't train the muscle properly.If you're squatting and you feel only your back working, take a timeout, lower the weights, and reevaluate your form.Whatever exercise you're performing, you should feel that particular target muscle working. Leave the ego at the door and focus on your form and technique for optimal results.8. Place a priority on rest and recoveryStrength training is vital to a successful transformation, but growth doesn't take place in the gym. Instead, it's determined by your actions outside of it.Lifting weights merely tears our muscle fibers down, while proper nutrition and rest helps our bodies recover, grow, and become stronger for the next time we enter the weight room.Always place rest over an extra workout session. Plus, it's nice to relax and treat our bodies well, we deserve it, life can be a grind at times.To learn more about Julian and how to build the body you want while making your dent in the universe, visit''The Art of Fitness and Life'and receive your free starter kit to get started toward remarkability."

To showcase the trend's adaptability, of course.Classic striped designs were highlighted by brands Calvin Klein and Blackspade, both of which veer towards more classic looks, regardless of trend. Blackspade interprets stripe width in new and interesting ways, and the Calvin Klein boxer brief looks purple, but it's actually an optical illusion - it is, in fact, a weave of cobalt and red orange stripes.British underwear brands, James Tudor and Aware Soho, play with red and black stripes, contrasting them with white waistbands. The three-button fly, however, are the real stand-out aspect to the James Tudor's. The Jor and Agacio brands are the sportiest by far - these two utilize pastels and white.But our favorite pair - which is, of course, the sexiest - is from the Male Power Radial Sport Collection. It is zippered with dual tone, zigzag stripes.

Working in my closet is not a job I enjoy, most likely because I am a sentimental fool. Every season I go through each piece of clothing and ask myself if it's a keeper or if I should give it away. After all, if you haven't worn something for a year or two it's time to get it out of your closet. Over the years I have gotten better about giving things away, but I still struggle. Our children were in high school before I was able to get rid of their baby clothes.High Class HoarderI heard my teenage nephew call my sister-in-law a ""high class hoarder."" I asked him what he meant and he said every Saturday his mother goes to yard sales in nice neighborhoods and brings home ""bargains"" that she just can't live without. I got a chuckle out of that and the word ""hoarder"" made me think of my grandmother. If you have ever known anyone who lived through the Great Depression you will understand why my grandmother kept the wrapping off of Christmas presents, folded it neatly and stuck it in a drawer to use the next year. She also kept every scrap of food that wasn't eaten at each meal. It didn't matter if it was two bites of beans, it went in an empty margarine tub and into the refrigerator. Maybe not being able to get rid of things is just a genetic trait I inherited, I don't know. What I do know for sure is that there are four things in my closet that I will never give away. Grandma's Blue Flannel Bath RobeMy grandmother was an amazing woman. When she married my grandfather they moved into a little white farm house with his mother, who I called Ma. Ma was wheelchair bound and my grandparents had to lift her from the bed to her chair, to the toilet and then back. It had to be hard to be a full-time caregiver and a new bride. Grandma took care of Ma until Ma's death at the age of 96. By the time Ma died Grandma had bore three babies in the little white house and raised them to adulthood in addition to everything else she did.Farm life back then was much harder than it is now. My grandparent had a few milk cows and lots of chickens. They grew a huge garden that hoed and kept weeded. After harvest time Grandma canned vegetables and kept them in the cellar where it was cool. There was no air conditioning in the house and the only source of heat in the winter came from two wood stoves.Grandma lived to be 89 and up until she was 85 she could work circles around me. She looked like a soft, fluffy marshmallow on the outside, but inside she was made of steel. Grandma's mother died when she was only three years old, so she had no memories of her mother. Her husband, my grandfather, died in 1976. Grandma's only daughter (my mother) died in 1990 of colon cancer and a year later my mother's older brother died. Grandma's heart was broken with each passing but she found strength from within and from her faith and she continued on.She lived with us the last several years of her life and helped me raise my children. One of my most vivid memories of her is when our twins were about two years old. They slept upstairs and Grandma knew that carrying them down the stairs would be too dangerous so the three of them would sit on the stairs and scoot all the way down. Grandma would be in the middle with the twins on either side of her.A few years before Grandma died I took her picture sitting on her porch reading her Bible. She wasn't too happy about it because she was wearing her blue bathrobe. It was early morning and she hadn't gotten dressed yet. I loved the picture and took it to a lady I knew whose hobby was painting. She painted a watercolor from the snapshot I made and today it hangs in my house and Grandma's blue bathrobe has a permanent place in my closet.The Silver Disco DressI graduated from high school in 1974 and my college years were filled with disco parties. I wasn't the best dancer, but I wasn't the worst either. I had enough rhythm to do the Bump and the Electric Slide but that was about it. My friends and I went to the movies and fell in love with John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. We listened (and danced) to the Bee Gees hits, Stayin Alive, How Deep Is Your Love, and Night Fever over and over again.I'm not sure when I bought the silver disco dress with the slits up the sides but I know I wore it to lots of dances. I took it with me on a trip to New York when I tagged along with my mother and her friends. And when my dad won a trip to Hawaii (he was a Ford tractor salesman) my brother and I went too, and so did the dress. I wore it to a night club in Honolulu that our parents took us to because my mother was a Don Ho fan. The only song I remember him singing was Tiny Bubbles. Don Ho sang like I danced; without much talent but with a whole lot of enthusiasm.My mother spoiled me while I was in college and I always had nice clothes. My girlfriends loved to borrow my things and I was more than willing to share. One of the most popular items in my closet was my silver disco dress. That dress went to more parties than any other piece of clothing I ever owned. Just for old times sake I took it off the hanger and tried it on today. No one but the dog saw me and he wasn't impressed.""I sure had a lot of fun in this dress,"" I said to the dog. He yawned, closed his eyes and went back to sleep.The Mom ShirtOne year for Mother's Day my husband surprised me with a tee-shirt. What made this shirt so special was that a lady had embroidered our children's faces and names on it. Even their eyes were the right color! I wore the shirt proudly and would probably still be wearing it had a drop of bleach not been spilled on it and eaten through the material. The faces on the shirt were little, just like our children were at the time. To me, that shirt symbolizes their childhood and how proud I was (and still am) to be their mom. There's no way in the world I'm ever getting rid of it.The Basketball ShirtOur twin boys are our babies because they were born last but they grew to be 6 ft. 8 inches tall. From the time they were old enough to play sports basketball was a part of their life and ours. My husband and I spent countless hours taking them to practices and games. My husband coached their little league teams and drove them to different states when they played on travel teams. We hardly ever missed a game and when their high school team made it to the State Class A Tournament we couldn't have been more excited. They were known locally as The Twin Towers and watching them dunk was more fun than dancing in my disco dress. I have a good friend who owned a tee-shirt shop and she made me a special shirt to wear to the twins games. Looking at it reminds me of all the joy our boys brought us during their basketball career.  Sentimental FoolI told you at the beginning of this story that I was a sentimental fool. I know it's silly to keep an old bath robe, a disco dress, a shirt with a hole in it and a basketball tee shirt that I will never wear to another ballgame, but the fact of the matter is that in a way they tell the story of my life. Looking at them I remember my grandmother's love and the powerful influence she had on my life. I reflect on the youthful exuberance and freedom of my teen and college years. The shirts bring back happy memories of when our children were young.I just can't, or I won't, get rid of them. I suspect the sentimental things a person can't bear to part with says more about them than the items they give away.So tell me, what's in your closet?Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

I love reading about simple things we can do to elevate mood and boost contentment. Mindfulness meditation, adequate sleep, laughing, volunteering, and spending time with pets (as well as with happy people) all help. And believe it or not, science shows you can also eat your way happier!If you’re in need of a little more glee, here are six research-backed “better mood foods” to build into your eating repertoire.Probiotic-rich foodsIn a recent Dutch study, 20 healthy volunteers received either a probiotic supplement or a placebo for four weeks. Those who received the real deal showed a significantly reduced reactivity to sad mood, which was largely due to a reduction in aggressive thoughts and rumination (you know, when you over-think or obsess on the negative). The conclusion: the type and amount of bacteria in your digestive tract impacts your mood. Scientists even have a name for it: the gut-brain axis, or the communication highway between the GI tract and the brain, and it’s fascinating.In an animal a study conducted at McMaster University in Ontario, gut bacteria from mice with different personalities were swapped. Fearless mice became timid after receiving gut bacteria from anxious counterparts, and the reverse was also true -- fearful rodents became more expressive and less apprehensive. The researchers also found that aggressive mice became calm when scientists changed their gut microbes by health-ing up their diets. All of this means that, for all intents and purposes, your gut bacteria can literally be mind-altering. To reap the benefits, stock up on probiotic-rich fermented foods, including kimchi, sauerkraut and kefir, or consider popping a probiotic supplement.Fruits and veggiesIn a study published in the British Journal of Health Psychology, nearly 300 young adults kept daily food journals for three consecutive weeks, in addition to completing psychological and mood-related ratings. Researchers found that a higher intake of produce resulted in more energy, calm and a greater sense of happiness. They also noted that the effects were seen not only on the days more veggies and fruits were consumed, but also throughout the following day. Another study, published in the journal Social Indicators Research, which tracked 80,000 adults, found that consuming a higher amount of produce boosted mental well-being, with the magic number for happiness being seven daily servings. To use produce to elevate your mood, choose fruits and veggies first and build each meal around them. For tips on how, check out my previous posts 5 Veggies That Make Perfect Pasta Alternatives and 5 Reasons to Eat More Fruit.CoffeeCoffee drinkers can be thought of as curmudgeons, but research has actually linked regular java consumption to positivity. In one study, researchers found that coffee consumed in the morning was linked to energy, kindness and pleasure. Coffee enjoyed socially was tied to affection, friendship, satisfaction, and good nature; and when sipped leisurely, cups of Joe induced calm, happiness and tranquility. Another study, published in the JAMA Internal Medicine, found that women who drank two to three cups of coffee a day were 15 percent less likely to develop depression over a 10-year span, compared to those who consumed one cup or less each day. Now that doesn’t mean a pot a day is a recipe for bliss, but if you enjoy coffee there are other health benefits to making it a daily habit. Check out my previous posts 6 Reasons to Keep Loving Coffee and 5 Reasons to Drink Coffee Before a Workout.Dark chocolateEven thinking about dark chocolate brings a smile to my face, but research backs its happiness benefits. The antioxidants in dark chocolate can trigger the walls of your blood vessels to relax, lowering blood pressure and improving circulation. That may be why one study found that eating about an ounce and a half of dark chocolate daily for two weeks reduced levels of stress hormones in people who rated themselves as highly stressed. Dark chocolate also contains magnesium, a mineral that has been shown to help alleviate PMS symptoms, including fatigue, depression and irritability. Finally, dark chocolate’s unique natural substances trigger a sense of euphoria that’s similar in to the feeling of being in love! For more check out my 5 Healthy Ways to Eat More Chocolate.MushroomsI adore mushrooms. In a previous post I wrote about five surprising benefits of this underrated superfood, and due to their unique nutrients, mood regulation may be a sixth. Shrooms are rich in selenium and research has linked a deficiency of this mineral (which doubles as an antioxidant) to a higher risk of depression, anxiety and fatigue. Mushrooms are also the only plant source of natural vitamin D, a key nutrient of us aren’t getting enough of. In a study of people with seasonal affective disorder, which affects 11 million Americans, scientists found that those who upped their vitamin D intake experienced an enhanced mood. To bolster your intake, incorporate mushrooms into omelets or quiche at breakfast, salads at lunch and sauté, grill, or oven roast them at dinner.Green teaA Japanese study, conducted with more than 40,000 people, found that levels of psychological stress were 20 percent lower in people who drank five or more cups of green tea per day compared to those who drank less than one. The results held true even after other factors were accounted for, including age, sex, medical history, body mass index, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and diet. Reach for green tea as a beverage, or incorporate loose tea leaves or brewed green tea into cooking. It’s fantastic in smoothies, marinades, soups and sauces.

Indeed, Woody Allen's Irrational Man, which just premiered at Cannes, is a sunny joy to watch, despite its sinister subject: a philosopher named Abe who cannot find meaning in life - -until he commits a radical act. Perhaps -- I suspect -- it is the abundance of sun in each scene and the jazzy soundtrack by the Ramsay Lewis Trio that makes the film so jaunty. Woody Allen privileges outdoor shots, each in a pleasant upper-class locale in Newport, Rhode Island, where the professor has come to teach. Two lovely women become enamored of the professor: a college student, played by the beauteous Emma Stone with the bright calm hazel eyes, and a wiry attractive married chemistry professor, played by the quirky Parker Posey, who is herself unsatisfied with life and wants the elsewhere signified by Abe. But our charismatic existentially despondent professor cannot get it up, with either woman. In desultory fashion, he carries a flask of whiskey, philosophizes, and plays (a highlight in the film) at Russian Roulette. Emma Stone The film becomes amusingly strange with a typical Woody Allen moment: an overheard conversation at a local diner. It is this chance banal conversation -- this sidetrack from the main story -- that becomes the main story. Inspired by his eavesdropping, our spiritless professor makes a radical ""choice"", takes on a sense of responsibility and, for the first time, embraces manhood, in all its virile senses. The film is engagingly light in humorous conversation, and the acting of Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone enchantingly seductive, so much so that the curious choice that becomes the climax of this film takes on whimsical charm. And yet the choice the professor makes is one that crosses the limit of Good and Evil. Allen's erudition in the subject of Evil--from Dostoyevsky to Hannah Arendt--is (as per course) apparent in this film: we are to ponder about right and wrong. However, there is a twist. While the director's recent films end on a cynical, if not nihilistic, note, this film has a cheery resolution, and indeed, for the first time, seems to make a plea for ""moral"" meaning. Although, on reflection, I did come up with a second reading of the ending lines, that may very well lead back to cynicism, the more expected outcome of a Woody Allen film. The director, at the press conference, corrected me on my cynical reading. ""No,"" he said. ""This ending is a deep moment for the character. The character has grown through this experience, with this brush with --- . It is something that will make [the character] reflect in the years to come.....""He was so earnest in his conviction in ""character growth"" that I wondered if the director has been pulling our legs all these years when he argues for the meaninglessness of existence.However, he went on, with great passion, to expound on ""meaninglessness"": the pessimistic philosophy that, in his view, is at the heart of his film. ""If you read the newspapers, you see that in every corner of the world, there are horrible things happening. You are living in a random universe. Everything you do is going to vanish, everything is going to be over, the sun is going to burst, everything that Beethoven and Mozart created will disappear."" In this context, any meaning we give our lives is an act of delusion. ""A majority of the people who survived the concentration camps did so because they believed in a false thing. The Communists were able to better cope with the stress because they were dedicated Communists, even if Communism eventually fell apart. Religion is another choice [of something to believe in]. The fact that it does not really work doesn't matter. It does make your life better if at least you believe in it.""Shedding light on the title of his film, the director added that, in fact, anything we choose to believe in is irrational: whether it is to be a good person or to do evil.""People need something to believe in their lives. They have to choose if life is going to be meaningful or meaningless for them. They will choose an irrational life. Some people think that if they make sure to lead a good life they will go to heaven. That's no more crazy than the act my character Joaquin makes. The choice that he makes is irrational, but it is not any more irrational than any of the choices we all make in our lives.""One might think that Woody Allen finds--at least---""meaning"" in his phenomenal creativity and success as a filmmaker. Doesn't art put a stopper in the waste of time? No. The director responded that even his gifts are but a distraction from the reality of annihilation.""Life has it own agenda and it runs us right over. We are all going to wind up in the same position, one way or another, one day or another. The only way out of it as an artist is to try to come up with something to explain to people why life has some meaning . It's a matter of conning your audience: selling them a bill of goods that there is any good to this. The only possible way you can beat [the meaningless of life] in any way is through distraction. You can distract people. [You distract yourself] through baseball, through watching Frank Sinatra. What distracts me is when I make my films is, for example, thinking about how I can get Emma and Parker to do such and such a scene together. It's a trivial problem, I won't die. I distract myself. Making movies is a wonderful distraction : a nice thing to keep you busy like basket weaving in an institution.....He leaned animatedly into the microphone:""There is no positive answer to the grim realities of life. All of the great thinkers, from Freud to O'Neill, thought that too much reality is too much to bear. So I go into a movie house and watch Fred Astaire dance. Then I get out of the movie house and I am hit with the problem once more.."" The nearly 80 year-old director quipped: ""For I will be old one day in the very distant future."" I could not help feeling that despite that ""very distant future"" that awaits us all, and the eventual explosion of the sun, this pleasurable moment of distraction with Woody was, in the meantime, meaningful."
27,BLACK VOICES,"61 Years After Brown v. Board Of Education, Many Schools Remain Separate And Unequal",Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brown-v-board-61-anniversary_n_7293344.html,,2015-05-17,"FILE - This Aug. 22, 1958 file photo shows Thurgood Marshall outside the Supreme Court in Washington. Saturday marks the 60th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. Many inequities in education still exist for black students and for Hispanics, a population that has grown exponentially since the 1954 ruling. Marshall, the head of the NAACP's legal arm who argued part of the case, went on to become the Supreme Court's first African-American justice in 1967. (AP Photo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0cb1210000e700c6c36c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Decades after the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling declared segregated schooling of black students unconstitutional, many American schools with high minority populations continue to receive fewer resources and provide an education that's inferior to schools with large white populations. For Sunday's 61st anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, which proclaimed ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,"" The Huffington Post takes a look at the state of education for black students in 2015. In many states, there continues to be stark disparities in resources provided to black students and white students. In Nevada, for example, high-minority school districts receive significantly less state and local funding per pupil than low-minority districts. These six graphs show the disparities.1.  High-minority districts typically received less funding per pupil from states and localities than low-minority districts during the 2011-2012 school year, according to the latest data from the National Center for Education Statistics. 2. Black students are significantly more likely to attend high-poverty schools than white students, according to the Urban Institute. ""In some metropolitan areas, the racial concentration of school poverty is so severe that black and white students effectively attend two different school systems: one for middle- and upper-middle-income white students, and the other for poor students and students of color,"" says an Urban Institute feature on the subject. 3. Students who attend high-minority schools often receive instruction from the least-qualified teachers. The Obama administration is trying to change this. In 2014, the White House announced the Excellent Educators for All initiative, which calls on states to develop plans that would more equitably distribute the best teachers. 4. White students and black students graduate high school at different rates. In 2013, 71 percent of African-American students graduated. Eighty-seven percent of white students did. 5. American classrooms are getting more diverse. But the teaching force remains overwhelmingly white. Data from the National Center for Education Information reveals that in 2011, about 84 percent of America's teachers identified as white. Department of Education research shows a similar trend. In a 2011-2012 Department of Education survey of teachers, more than 80 percent identified as white.""Teachers of color can serve as role models for students of color,"" says a 2014 report from the Center for American Progress on the subject. ""When students see teachers who share their racial or ethnic backgrounds, they often view schools as more welcoming places.""6. Black students are expelled or suspended from school nearly three times more than their white counterparts, according to the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. Unfortunately, these disparities start as early as preschool. Data from 2011-2012 shows that black toddlers are more likely to be suspended from preschool than their white peers. "
28,GOOD NEWS,How Laramie's LGBT Decision Awakens Us,"Rev. Stephen V. Sprinkle, Ph.D., ContributorAuthor, 'Unfinished Lives: Reviving the Memories of LGBTQ Hate...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-laramies-lgbt-decisio_b_7294170.html,"After 17 years of dogmatic slumber and denial over the grisly murder of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard, Laramie's City Council passed the state's first broad LGBT protection ordinance.",2015-05-17,2015-05-15-1431718441-2396356-Matthew_ShepardARTSM.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-15-1431718441-2396356-Matthew_ShepardARTSM-thumb.jpg,"After 17 years of dogmatic slumber and denial over the grisly murder of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard, Laramie's City Council passed the state's first broad LGBT protection ordinance. Council members voted 7-2 to prohibit discrimination in the city limits against persons based on sexual orientation and gender identity in matters of housing, employment, and access to public facilities such as cafés. Like Rip Van Winkle rousing from a long sleep, the city that still only memorializes Matt with a plaque on a park bench awakened and finally addressed its phobias head-on. What took place in Laramie on May 12 was not just a one-off decision. It has implications for the rest of the nation, too. Like Laramie, no town wants to admit that a bias-driven hate crime took place there. Locales loathe bad publicity. They fear being labeled. So, they deny the problem in a variety of ways. They indulge in blaming the victim. Or sweep the killing under the rug. Or blame ""outside agitators"" and ""other mitigating factors."" The common refrain is ""Things like that just don't happen here."" But they do happen in American hometowns everywhere, all the time. The only healthy, sane thing for a city or town to do when a murder marks a place forever is to own up to it squarely, and do something to address the root causes that allowed prejudice to take root in the first place. Ask Dallas. Or Memphis. Or Birmingham. You surely can't make the facts go away. You can and you must rebuild your civic reputation by ensuring that justice and equality for all your citizens take the place of dehumanization and denial. Laramie started that painful process by doing the right thing last Wednesday night. For seventeen long years, local townsfolk and university students of conscience lobbied Laramie's elected officials, tried to reason with them, and stood up to their xenophobic neighbors. They opposed the powerful anti-human rights forces that were invested in re-writing the story of the nighttime abduction and brutal beating of slim, slight Matt Shepard by two local men gone bad that unfolded before the world in the Albany County Courthouse. Too many gay people saw no evidence that anything would ever change in Laramie, so they packed up their talent and their verve for living, and left town one or two at a time. Though LGBT people and their allies lost the argument year after year, those who remained persisted in pointing out that the perpetrators, Henderson and McKinney, weren't ""outsiders."" They were homegrown products of Laramie public schools, men who grew up in the same city as Pioneer Days and UW Cowboy Pride. Matt Shepard was not to blame for his own death, no matter what deniers contended, they argued. After losing a close vote to enact a similar statewide discrimination law in February, Wyoming Equality and local advocates mounted the effort that finally passed the first broadly inclusive anti-discrimination ordinance in the ""Equality State."" Its provisions will go into effect before the end of the month. No victim of hate crime ever ""had it coming."" No family ever deserves the horror and grief Judy, Dennis, and Logan Shepard have suffered. The public outcry raised by Matt's death roused other states and municipalities long before Laramie woke up to what happened at the Fireside Lounge and on that cold, high ridge with the buck fence above town. In October 2009, President Obama signed The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law, saying, ""We must stand against crimes that are meant not only to break bones, but to break spirits - not only to inflict harm, but to instill fear."" Now, Laramie transgender high school student Rihanna Kelver can more confidently go about her life, relieved that she will not lose her job because of how she identifies, one of the first practical results of this ordinance. Throughout the rest of the country, however, hate crime violence against LGBT Americans is hitting historic highs. With widespread publicity concerning the cause célèbre of the day, Marriage Equality, attacks on vulnerable persons, especially gay men and transgender people of color, are alarmingly on the rise. Thinly veiled efforts to turn back the clock on equality cloaked in the garb of ""religious freedom,"" the RFRAs, are proliferating around the nation. Seeking to stall justice, retrogrades like Texas are trying to enact pre-emptive laws inoculating the states against a possible Supreme Court decision striking down the bans against same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, like Laramie prior to Wednesday night's anti-discrimination victory, the rest of the nation seems to have drifted back into a Rip Van Winkle coma while innocent LGBT people by their thousands face brutalization and harm in towns and cities every succeeding year. Laramie, the longtime hold out for LGBT protections, has awakened to its responsibility for its most vulnerable residents. If Laramie can do it, after so many years of misdirection, denial, and historical revisionism, surely the rest of us must wake up to our responsibilities, as well. Justice must bloom in the thousands of urban and rural settings where everyday Americans live and work. It is high time for all forms of heterosexism and homophobia to be put on notice that hate is not an American value. Local advocates must press their elected officials to pass anti-discrimination laws and make them stick. One of the most encouraging signs of this awakened determination to do right by everybody is the Golden Rule attitude of Laramie resident Mike Sumner who said during public speak out time before the City Council vote, ""As a Christian I do sin when I fail to follow the loving and compassionate example of Jesus Christ,"" he said. ""And I believe that a vote against this ordinance is the same as throwing the first stone."" Drop the stones in your hand, America. Laramie has shown us how to do it."

At least that was the image that emerged from the Hill this week, as lawmakers, vanguards, pundits and top aides harangued over granting President Obama the executive authority to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). When the vote came to the floor, Senate Democrats shot down the bill, an act of defiance that landed them a private meeting in the White House to smooth things over with the embattled President. So buckle your seat belts, because it's going to be a hot summer on Capitol Hill.Whereas Senate Democrats held the bill hostage with pork barreling tactics and vowed to throw all the procedural spanners in the works to undermine the measure, firebrand leftist Elizabeth Warren struck a different tone. In a highly cited op-ed in the Washington Post, the Massachusetts Senator riled up spirits by attacking a somewhat arcane provision hidden in the fine print of the TPP: the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). On paper, the ISDS sounds as if it was made to pander to greedy corporate interests. And that's because it was. Under the ISDS, corporations can basically sue foreign governments for potential revenue lost because of new regulations enacted by the respective state. The dispute is not settled in sovereign courts or under the banner of international organizations, but in special, ad-hoc arbitration panels whose decisions cannot be appealed. But what's all the fuss about, especially since the ISDS has been around for more than half a century? Well, in recent years, faced with a ballooning number of cases, scholars have argued that companies are increasingly abusing the policy: ""investor-state arbitration has shifted from being a shield of last resort to a sword of first resort in many disputes ... between governments and foreign investors."" In other words, companies are turning to the laxer ISDS to fight their battles instead of going through national courts where they stand less chances of winning.Indeed, as I wrote in a previous post, even if ISDS tribunals cannot order the government to change the contentious law, they disproportionately target Latin American countries that oftentimes lack the financial means to take on corporations whose quarterly profits exceed their GDP. In her op-ed, Warren cites several high profile cases that have sought to weaken labor or environmental rules: a French company sued Egypt over Cairo's decision to raise the minimum wage, or the case of a Swedish company that sued Germany because Berlin had decided to phase out nuclear reactors in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. In another egregious example of manipulating what was supposed to be an insurance policy against corrupt governments, Philip Morris challenged a tough tobacco regulation in Australia, prompting New Zeeland to scrap its similar law over fears of costly litigation.Senator Warren is right that the system is in dire need of reform and Democrats are right to express concern over handing the White House a blank check to negotiate the TPP. After all, if the fast-track measure is approved, Congress will only get to decide in thumbs up/thumbs down fashion over the entire text of the bill. And who could say no to a deal that promises billions in extra growth, countless jobs and increased cooperation between Washington and Asia's Eastern seaboard? Advocates also argue that the TPP is not just a 12-country trade deal but, thanks to its requirements of raising democratic standards in signatory nations, an essential part in making sure China won't write the playbook on Asian governanceHowever, all the potential perks stemming from the TPP's approval do not mean that lawmakers should simply pay lip service to the White House's version of the bill - the ISDS is a case in point. But here's a thought - instead of twiddling her fingers in the media, what if Warren joins hands with another like-minded vanguard: Cecilia Malmström.Cecilia who?Cecilia Malmström is the European Union's Trade Commissioner, charged with negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between Washington and Brussels. The world's biggest trade deal, it would create a huge market of 850 million consumers and link 60% of global output. The talks were progressing at a steady pace - that is until lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic opened the chapter on ISDS. Thereafter, harried by strong opposition from France, Germany, and the public opinion, negotiations were suspended last year. After intense internal negotiations, the European Commission (a diluted version of our own federal government) cobbled together a list of proposals to overcome the ISDS snafu. Similar to the White House's own TPP head ache, the Europeans need to secure unanimous support from member states to pass the deal and the ISDS is the main sticking point.Bemoaning the erosion of national sovereignty, Commissioner Malmström noted that the ISDS system ""is not fit for purpose in the 21st century"". ""I want the rule of law, not the rule of lawyers"", she added in what reads like an Elizabeth Warren sound bite. Indeed, just like Warren, Malmström is aiming for the same goal: arbitration tribunals should operate like traditional courts, should allow the right to appeal, and should be endowed with a clear code of conduct for arbitrators in order to minimize conflicts of interests. Malmström went even a step further, calling for the establishment of a permanent global arbitration court to hear ISDS disputes, instead of the current inchoate system of ad-hoc panels. As expected, Washington outright rejected the EU's offer through the voice of Undersecretary for International Trade, Stefan Selig. So why doesn't Warren team up with Malmström? Sure, the European proposal isn't perfect, but it strikes a good middle ground between supporters and opponents of the ISDS. As things stand now, only a compromise will secure the votes both on Capital Hill and in the byzantine corridors of the European Union. Therefore, instead of spending political capital in rhetorical battles with the Obama administration in the media - a debate that got reduced to whether the President was sexist or not in his remarks - Warren should use her considerable political capital and push for Malmström's plan. Just saying ""NO ISDS"" and filibustering like Ted Cruz taking on Obamacare does not a good policy make, and certainly this is not what Warren's constituents expect from a US Senator."

How was I ever going to skateboard in my 60s like I did in the '60s? As it turned out, the production of Skateboarding's First Wave was a delightful experience for all involved which resulted in a high-quality, very entertaining film contribution to the history of skateboarding.In 2013, Tim Keller, the former 14-year-old leader of the Palisades Skateboard Team in Los Angeles, California (one of the top teams in the country in the '60s), wrote an article about the team and the beginnings of skateboarding called Skateboarding's First Wave: A Palisades Story. This led then 9-year-old Donny of the team -- now Don Burgess, not so little, a grandfather, and an Academy Award-nominated cinematographer (Forrest Gump) -- to look for some vintage skateboarding footage that his father had taken of the group. When he found it, Tim and Don called for a reunion to do a short documentary comparing the ""back in the day"" shoots with footage and interviews of us fifty to sixty somethings on our skateboards today.Come ""game day"" for the filming, I showed up with all of my safety gear, but none of the other team members were wearing any. I'd already made one trip to the emergency room during my first practice session and was determined not to have to go back. Although no one told me not to use the protective gear, unfortunately, I let myself feel peer-pressured into leaving it in my car. Most cautiously, I decided to take the hill sideways in the slowest possible way. Yet within seconds, my board flew out from under me, and I was flat on the asphalt with a horrific-looking bloody elbow. I refused to go to the emergency room even though I probably needed at least five stitches and had some kind of minor fracture. My injuries would heal, but when would I ever get another chance to be in a skateboarding movie? Director Don compassionately had his crew film me doing simple kick turns on a flat surface so I could still appear in the movie. Fearing another tumble and in pain, I was so cautious that I looked positively geriatric. The exhales of onlookers were audible when I finished without incident. ""That's a wrap!"" never sounded so good. Why, oh why had I stopped going to yoga class? It did so much for my balance.Looking back, it's hard to believe what we did on those boards as kids. What was exhilarating then now looks downright scary to me. We didn't realize at the time that we were being pioneers. We just loved skateboarding, and the more difficult the challenge, the more we liked it! Palisades Skateboard Team c. 1965The reunion party was a hoot! We shared all of the old stories -- at least, what we senior citizens could still remember. We had a lot to catch up on, since most of us hadn't seen each other since high school. I learned a number of important details from the others that I had forgotten from my youth -- some of which I didn't want to remember -- and a lot about the twists and turns of our lives. There were those who didn't make it, who had died or succumbed to drug abuse and other life challenges. We knew we were the lucky ones.Not only did the documentary juxtapose the old and modern footage of our team effectively, but it also creatively incorporated skateboarding cuts from other films, television commercials, and popular shows at the time like What's My Line?, Shindig!, and ABC's Wide World of Sports. The musical soundtrack was even composed by one of the team members, singer and songwriter Peter Burg. My children and in-laws joined me at the premiere, and we were very impressed with how well it turned out. It is now being shown at various forums like the Newport Film Festival, and the feedback has been wonderful! Without exaggeration, I was the worst current-day skater of the bunch. That 50-year break took quite a toll on me. I could not skateboard in my sixties like I did in the Sixties, at least not without more preparation, but the others could. I don't know how they managed to hop back on their boards so skillfully with little practice and end up with no more than one skinned knee in the bunch. Yet despite the cuts and bruises, I am very glad I participated. The ordeal also gave me a jump-start for my new fitness program of pedometer-motivated walking, weight training, and swimming. I've even gone back to yoga. Maybe one day I'll provide a comeback story for septuagenarians (if I can remember how to spell it)!Most importantly, our team came to appreciate the bond we had from those days. We helped to invent a sport -- no small challenge and contribution. And girls had so few sporting options then. Skateboarding represented a way to compete when other avenues were closed. We gave each other the courage to reject the idea that girls didn't belong on a skateboard as there were so few of us in our community. And this courage about where we belonged transferred to other arenas throughout our lives. Thankfully, the boys encouraged us, and they grew up to be rather impressive gentlemen -- hardly the skateboarder stereotype. While I have no interest in ever doing a half-pipe (a modern skateboarding ramp), when it comes time to autograph the vintage skateboarding cards that have yet to be invented, I'll be ready. And getting back in shape has become my top priority of late. After all, who else will teach my granddaughter how to skateboard if I don't?Skateboarding's First Wave is showing at Dances With Films in Hollywood, California, on June 2, 2015, at 2:45 p.m. and at Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, California, on June 13 at 2 p.m."

We experienced some amazing moments in Hawaii, such as getting engaged on Waimanalo beach. However at the time, Megan wasn't legally allowed to move to Hawaii due the lack of gay rights. That being the case, after 4 years of battling the distance, I packed up my life and moved to the UK to bridge the gaps in geography and to ultimately start my life with the one I loveWhat I didn't really think through, or prepare for, is that in moving to join the love of my life, I had to leave everything and everyone else behind. I conquered one long distance to only find myself in another one! I'm now left being in a long distance relationship with my Mother, Father, family and friends. Being my mother's only child naturally made us extremely close growing up; she was a wonderful mother and made me the person I am today. I knew I had to leave in order to start a family with my now wife, but I didn't realise I was essentially leaving her to join another family. Megan's family have been amazing and have truly accepted and made me apart of the family, however it's incredibly hard to have to spend birthdays, mother's day, Christmas', Thanksgivings, etc away from my own family. Guilt starts to set in. It's one thing moving states, which I have done several times, but moving countries with completely different time zones is another matter entirely.Having visited the UK many times, I thought I knew all there was to a British life. There was a massive novelty at first when I moved to the UK with its thriving culture, the London city life, fantastic work balance, the charming accents and the beautiful English countryside. Life simply couldn't be better. However, that soon faded away and then I encountered culture shock. I found myself seeing things differently- ""the roads are too small, I have no space, I can't understand that person, what did they say? What do you mean no refills? Rain again? Why do all the shops close at 17:30, what is 17:30? Why is it a shop and not a store? You call this a road trip, it's only 2 hours?"" Luckily, the love I have for my wife outweighed the negatives and I began to accept the things I couldn't change and adjust to life here in the UK. Then comes the time I get to visit 'home', America, and excitement takes over- ""I love America, free refills all the way, road trips, space, ample parking, convenience!' A week later, ""no one is available because they are working, the roads are too busy, you have to drive everywhere, American accents become overpowering, this is way too much food. I need a cup of tea."" I find myself wanting to go 'home', to England.It's a vicious cycle and a figure eight. My heart is constantly torn between two countries and two cultures. How in the world does one overcome this? Why do I have to be torn with the filling of sadness and missing a loved one ALL of the time? Does it get easier?I've found that there is light at the end of the tunnel. After near 3 years of permanently living in the UK with my beautiful wife and the happy life we created, I've come to the understanding that yes, my heart will always be torn, but it does get easier. Rather than feeling guilty and seeing this as a bad thing, I have come to find that when you are in a unique situation like mine, you have to fully embrace it and accept that your life is different to your friends and family. I've learnt that living in another country and being in a long distance relationship with loved ones provides you with such an amazing perspective and opportunity in life, not only for myself but my mother and friends have been able to visit and experience life in the UK. Culture shock has been a surprising encounter and one that will continue to happen throughout life. I've realised that you never actually escape being in a long distance relationship with someone you love. It will never end but it makes you appreciate and treasure the time that you do get to spend with your family and friends. There are also a few perks and positives to take away, it enables you to not only accept change, but welcome change and adapt to different cultures and people. You will definitely be a jet-setter for the rest of your life! You will find that your heart toughens up and starts preparing you for life's challenges.

33,WORLDPOST,Why Venezuela Has Shortages Of Everything From Corn To Condoms,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/venezuela-shortages-explained_n_7298426.html,,2015-05-17,"Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro applauds during the closing of the ""Cumbre de los Pueblos"" or ""People's Summit"" in Panama City, Saturday, April 11, 2015. (AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14cc52400003300382c0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Chris Sabatini about the politics behind Venezuela's unusual economic policies and why the Obama administration is facing a backlash for sanctioning Venezuelan officials accused of abusing human rights.Venezuela's socialist government has long been one of the region's most controversial. Former President Hugo Chávez, who died in March 2013, launched a left-wing, nationalist political movement that defined itself in opposition to U.S. influence in Latin America, which he derided as ""Yankee imperialism."" Since Chávez's successor Nicolás Maduro has taken the reins of government, however, Venezuela's economy has spiraled out of control -- partly due to the declining price of oil, its most important export, and partly due to unusual economic policies first put in place by Chávez. Shortages of food and other consumer products, and the gaming of a complex currency control system have become common. The country's ever-contentious relationship with the U.S. government has continued to slide, with the Obama administration announcing in March that it would sanction seven military and elected officials over human rights abuse allegations. To understand what's driving Venezuela's unique economic problems and their political significance, we spoke with Chris Sabatini, a foreign policy expert with two decades of experience focusing on Latin American affairs both in government and as the former policy director for the Americas Society, a New York-based think tank. Sabatini, who teaches at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, will officially launch a new digital publication covering the region called Latin America Goes Global on May 21. We read a lot in the press about Venezuela's unusual currency system, which can be confusing to outsiders. What is the Venezuelan government trying to do? Basically there's a three-tiered system and a black market system. At the top tier, the rate is about seven [Venezuelan] bolívares to the dollar, while on the black market it's about 300 bolívares to the dollar -- so you can see the huge level of overvaluation of the bolívar. One reason they do it is they give food imports a generous rate. Venezuela imports almost all of its food. It imports a lot of things because the oil-based economy has squeezed out other sources of production. So they ensure favorable rates to hopefully make food available and cheaper for Venezuelan citizens.How is it working out for them?It's working horribly for them. First of all, they have to spend a lot of dollars to keep that rate up. Consequently, their central bank is really strapped for hard currency. Second, it's created a whole system of corruption -- a three-tiered rate and a black market in which people, often times close to the government, are arbitraging these different rates. So people will claim they're going to import, say, foodstuffs and get dollars at the official rate, the best rate, and then they'll turn around and sell the dollars on the black market for 300 bolívares to the dollar. It's a huge windfall, as you can imagine. There are huge opportunities for corruption. We also see a lot of reporting about shortages of everything from corn flour to condoms. Why does Venezuela keep running out of things?The preferential rates they're giving to people allow importers to game the system. They're not actually importing those things or not in the quantities they're claiming because they're then turning around and making a much better profit by doing currency arbitrage than by importing condoms or diapers or what-have-you. The second reason though is that the government, first under Chávez and then under Maduro, has expropriated [taken control of] a number of production facilities -- everything from soda and beverage companies to dairy farms to supermarkets, food production, and they've basically created all these bottlenecks. It creates inefficiencies. And because of different price controls ... particularly in the public markets, it actually isn't profitable for some people to produce these things. Inputs are sometimes as expensive or more than the prices they could charge for the product on the market. The government likes to claim that the elite are hoarding goods and to a certain extent they are, in the sense that they're not producing to their full capacity. But largely that's because of the price controls that [the government] has created. The Obama administration imposed sanctions in March on seven Venezuelan military and elected officials over allegations of human rights abuses. Obama's faced a lot of criticism in the region for that. In your view, were those sanctions justified?The sanctions were very targeted. There's only seven officials. It only yanks their visas, their ability to enter the United States. And it froze any assets they had in the United States, under the assumption that they may have been ill-gotten gains, from corruption or even narcotics trafficking.Yes, it was likely justified. But was it politically wise to do it when they did it? Probably not. These are only sanctions that limit people who are alleged to have been human rights abusers or to be corrupt to enter the United States. We've done the same thing in Russia, after the crackdown with the annexation of Crimea and the civil war in Ukraine. We did the same thing in Honduras after the coup d'etat of 2009, in which we imposed very similar sanctions on de facto government officials. It's certainly within the scope of a government's rights to be able to say who should enter its borders if it has serious doubts about the moral qualities of these people, these violators of international norms. Now, was it politically wise is another matter and the answer, clearly, is probably not. The Maduro government is on a downward trajectory in terms of its political support, its economic management, its ability to control the country. This provided a very opportune distraction for him. As a result, he didn't get a huge bump in his approval ratings -- about 6 percent probably, [from] about 22 to 28 percent, is what I saw. Still pretty low, but it gave him something else to talk about other than of why people don't have corn flour or don't have condoms. How effective were they?I think it sent a message, but the timing was off. And it probably should have been coordinated better with other countries in the region, because it made it more difficult -- although it shouldn't be an excuse -- for [those countries] to speak out about cases of political prisoners, detentions, violations of freedom of expression. The Maduro administration has faced strong criticisms over its handling of the economy. How will that translate politically? Does Maduro face serious opposition in the Venezuelan legislature?Economically, this government has been a disaster. People are talking now about inflation maybe by the end of this year reaching 200 percent, reaching hyperinflation proportions. There are questions about whether it can make its external sovereign debt payments over the next few years. There's going to be a serious fiscal shortfall. And of course, there are shortages in the supermarkets. And that's clearly taken a political toll on this government. Its approval rating is in the 20s -- very low. But that hasn't necessarily translated into a direct groundswell of opposition to them in the way one would expect. The political opposition has for a long time made its opposition to the Chávez government, the Maduro government, about the political, about ""la salida,"" the exit. It was much more of a partisan effort. So it's been difficult for them to now capture this economic distress, which includes former supporters of this government but who are not as comfortable with the overtly partisan nature of what the political opposition has traditionally been selling as an alternative. Because of some electoral shenanigans, some gaming of the electoral rules, chavistas [supporters] maintain a majority in the National Assembly despite the opposition gaining a majority of votes in the last election, and they've removed several opposition legislators. So, typical of this government, they have manipulated institutions to marginalize opponents and to consolidate power in way that has really weakened what could be, potentially, a mediating space between the opposition and the government.
