Article by Robert Firpo-Cappiello.Have you ever had a conversation where moments -- or even days -- later you realize, ""I wish I'd said that""? Travel booking and airline and hotel check-ins can often feel like that, with so many questions, options, and price points to juggle. The travel experts at Budget Travel have been there and back. We've assembled a 12-point cheat sheet with 12 phrases to help make your next travel booking easier, nab you some upgrades, and save you money.""Can I get an upgrade?""Well, that question seems a little on-the-nose, doesn't it? But most airline passengers never ask, and it can pay off. Ask politely, and if you're met with silence, be willing to wait for an answer instead of backing down. Last-minute first and business class seat availability can mean you pay an ""up-sell"" fee (typically $50 and up) to get out of coach. The same question can work at a hotel, especially if it's a hotel that caters to business travelers and you're checking in over the weekend.""Bump me!""Airline crews deal with a lot of tired, anxious and sometimes just plain cranky passengers all day every day. Letting them know that you're willing to get bumped to another flight solves some major problems for them -- and can result in your being moved up to first class just because you were willing to be accommodating. Note: It might also get you bumped, so use this phrase only if you mean it.""I serve in the military.""We can't guarantee it, but first-class passengers have been known to trade seats with military personnel as a way of saying ""thank you"" for their service. On a more predictable note, cruise lines will often offer a discount if you tell them about your military service.""Would you like some chocolate?""This may sound a little precious, but as Budget Travel's Trip Coach Fran Golden reported last year, handing out one-pound chocolate bars to the gate agents and flight crew gets John E. DiScala, founder of travel advice site johnnyjet.com, a better coach seat or upgrade about half the time.""We're on our honeymoon!""Our evidence here is anecdotal, but Budget Travel readers have reported that telling airline personnel at check-in that you're newlyweds can get you moved to first or business class. Hotels, of course, will almost always respond with an indulgence or two. But don't say it if it's not true -- apart from the fact that lying is wrong, you may have a difficult time answering questions about your alleged recent nuptials!""I have kids.""Hotels may be willing to upgrade you to a suite at no charge, and if you ask for a later check-out to accommodate the little ones you'll almost always get a thumbs-up.""I'm flying alone.""When airlines try to accommodate families who want to sit together, it helps if they know they can move your seat, and there's a chance they'll move you to first or business class, where single empty seats are more common.""Give me the cheapest car you have.""We know, we know. When renting a car, you don't really want to cram yourself into the cheapest model in the company's garage. But if you're willing to take the chance, booking the lowest-priced car available and showing up super-early in the morning (before most people have returned their rental cars) can garner you a free upgrade to a bigger car.""Has the price gone down?""Yeah, airline seats and hotel room prices fluctuate, and there's a chance that the price has dropped since you made your reservation. Call the airline or hotel regularly as your trip approaches and, if the price goes down, ask for a refund or re-book. (But make sure there's no significant re-booking fee!)""Is that 'free' newspaper going to cost me $25?""Resorts are notorious for tacking on fees up to $25 per night for goodies you might assume were free -- including pool towels, Wi-Fi, newspaper delivery, gym access, and even access to the resort's casino. Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Las Vegas are especially known for these non-negotiable surprises. Your best bet it to ask about extra fees up front when making a reservation.""I'm a return customer.""When booking a cruise, mentioning that you've sailed with the line before can nab you a five to 15 percent discount on your fare.""I'm 55+.""Yup, just remembering the 1960s should get you a five percent discount from most cruise lines.More From Budget Travel:5 Credit Cards Every Traveler Should Consider 6 Smart Ways to Save on a Cruise How to Pay for Your Vacation 8 Ways to Save Big on Summer TravelWant the inside scoop on the hottest travel deals?

2,TRAVEL,TSA To Use Electronic 'Randomizers' To Create Security Lines,Emi Boscamp,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tsa-randomizers-screening-security-lines_us_5b9d57c5e4b03a1dcc86e067,TSA has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to prospective vendors who could procure such devices. In a statement to Today,2013-07-12,"DENVER - NOVEMBER 22: Air travelers move through a main security checkpoint at the Denver International Airport on November 22, 2010 in Denver, Colorado. The TSA is bracing for heavy traffic the day before Thanksgiving, as two separate internet campaigns are promoting a 'National Opt-Out Day' protest during which travelers are urged to 'opt out' of the new body scanners because of concerns over privacy and possible exposure to radiation. Those passengers who refuse the scans must instead undergo an enhanced pat down by TSA agents, which could further slow down security lines on the busiest air travel day of the year.

TSA is now planning to use electronic 'randomizers' to randomly route passengers to a conveyor belt.Aside from the obvious motive of creating a bias-free way of assigning passengers to lines, the randomizer would eliminate the option for potential terrorists to choose which line to go through based on the explosive detection devices or screening procedures. Last year, TSA officers at Boston's Logan Airport said that their colleagues were racially profiling passengers in response to pressure from managers.TSA has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to prospective vendors who could procure such devices. In a statement to Today in the Sky on its motivation for the randomizers, TSA said that it ""employs a multilayer approach to security, utilizing measures that are both seen and unseen, and will always incorporate random and unpredictable security measures.""This device would allow TSA to control the security lines without the worry of profiling or selecting passengers based on physical appearance. The RFI spells out the very specific and necessary characteristics of the randomizer that would ensure its success. For example, it notes that “the system shall display user defined percentage ratios only when the ratios are being configured,” allowing the TSA to be in control of the ratio of passengers assigned to each line.As for the actual randomizer device, it must be visible to both the passenger and the document checker, but we shouldn't be expecting an obtrusive piece of machinery. The RFI states, ""smaller is better."""
3,PARENTING,U.K. Moms Awaiting Kate Middleton's Baby Name Choice Leave Own Newborns Nameless,Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moms-kate-middleton-baby-name_us_5b9d56ede4b03a1dcc86d6f1,"Netvouchercodes.co.uk, a U.K. discount shopping website, found that new U.K. moms are willing to leave their own newborns",2013-07-11,"LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 15: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge during the annual Trooping The Colour ceremony at Buckingham Palace on June 15, 2013 in London, England. (Photo by Mark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d56ed2000002d00fded2c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hopefully Kate Middleton has put a lot of thought into the name of her royal baby, because the choice could affect lots of other United Kingdom mothers. Netvouchercodes.co.uk, a U.K. discount shopping website, found that new U.K. moms are willing to leave their own newborns nameless in order to find out what Middleton and husband Prince William name their baby. The company surveyed 400 new moms and found that more than 10 percent are hoping to postpone naming their children until Clarence House announces the royal baby's name, according to a press release obtained by The Huffington Post. Moms can wait up to six weeks before they have to legally decide on a name. Meanwhile, Middleton is due any day now and Britain is currently on royal baby watch.While some would like the royal couple to give their first child a unique name (one survey respondent said she'd be happy to see a Princess Angel or a Prince Dolphin), it is likely the prince and duchess will stick with something more traditional. Coral Bookmakers, a U.K. bookmaking firm, revealed to People magazine the odds are stacked for a baby girl with the name Charlotte. Other top picks for a little princess include Alexandra, Elizabeth and Diane. If it's a boy, bettors think the couple will go with George or Frances. “My husband and I have decided to wait to see what the royal baby is called before naming ours,"" one pregnant survey respondent told Netvouchercodes. “We have thought of quite a few names but we both decided it would be lovely to see what Will and Kate choose first. I love the name Alexandra so if we have a girl then it may well be the most straight forward decision we have to make.""Another mom-to-be said, “My baby is due before the royal baby, but I already know I definitely want it to have the same name. The birth of Will and Kate’s baby is such a monumental event that is going to be remembered forever, just like the royal wedding. Giving my baby the same name is my personal way of celebrating.”""The birth of the royal baby is hugely exciting; when someone famous has a baby the naming of it can be important to many people,"" a spokesperson for Netvouchercodes.co.uk said in a statement sent to HuffPost. ""Whatever name the royal couple choose there is no doubt that there will be thousands of babies who will also share the same name.""Media are camped outside St. Mary's Hospital in London, where Prince William was born 31 years ago, Reuters notes. The baby, who is third in line to the throne, will be delivered by Marcus Setchell, the Queen's former gynecologist. The gender of the child remains a mystery. "
