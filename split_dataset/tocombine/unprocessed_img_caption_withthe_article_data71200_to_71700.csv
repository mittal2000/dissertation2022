Bill Gates is in Ghana to meet with government and health officials on ways to combat global health problems. Bill Gates Foundation donates at least five percent of its asset each year to fight Polio Myelitis, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and other global infectious diseases across the globe.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565f7f2a170000f900e1afdc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mark Zuckerberg took a page out of his ""hero"" Bill Gates' book on Tuesday when he unveiled his new philanthropic group, but the Facebook CEO is adding his own twist to the initiative.When Zuckerberg introduced his daughter, Max, on Tuesday, he also revealed his, and his wife’s plan to launch the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The couple plans on eventually donating 99 percent of their Facebook shares, valued at $45 billion, to the effort, but the initiative is a little different than what Zuckerberg’s mentors have heralded.The tech mogul has said he’s long admired Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates who, together with his wife Melinda, have devoted a sizable portion of their wealth to solving global crises. But unlike Gates, Zuckerberg's eponymous foundation will have more leeway in how it allocates its funds. Unlike the Gates Foundation, which is a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is a limited-liability company (LLC). Part of what distinguishes the two is that Zuckerberg’s group has more wiggle room in the way it doles out money. The group can make political donations, for example. And it also isn’t required to give 5 percent of its value away every year, according to Fast Company.That piece may play into Zuckerberg’s overarching strategy to gradually find long-term solutions, instead of rushing to pour money into an issue.""We must make long term investments over 25, 50, or even 100 years,” the Facebook CEO wrote in the letter to his daughter. ""The greatest challenges require very long time horizons and cannot be solved by short term thinking.""While Zuckerberg has come under fire for not launching an outright charitable endeavor, his approach may actually enable him and wife, Priscilla Chan, to more effectively execute their mission. “The beauty of having an LLC in today’s world is No. 1, you have the ability to act and react as nimbly as need be to create change,” Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, a philanthropy expert, told The New York Times. “You have the ability to invest politically, in the for-profit sector and the nonprofit sector simultaneously.” The organization, though, will likely be an acceleration of the philanthropic work Chan and Zuckerberg have already accomplished. The pair said the organization will initially focus on personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities, Facebook said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post.Chan and Zuckerberg have already demonstrated their commitment to supporting these causes.In 2010, Zuckerberg donated $100 million to improve the education system in Newark, New Jersey and gave $120 million to California schools last year. During the Ebola crisis last year, the pair donated $25 million to fighting the epidemic. And Facebook has committed to providing free Internet to U.N. refugee camps around the world. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative plans to further address these causes by supporting nonprofits and participating in policy debates, with the goal of “generating positive impact in areas of great need.” The group will also make private investments and use the profits to fund additional work for the group’s mission. And while Zuckerberg may have deviated somewhat from Gates’ charity model, he still earned his approval.“Community for Mark and Priscilla isn’t just a word, it’s a core value,” Gates said in a statement. “I can’t wait to see what they achieve, not just with their wealth, but by their example and with their ingenuity, creativity and vision applied to some of the biggest challenges -- and opportunities -- of our time.”"
3,POLITICS,Senate Republicans Just Blocked A Bunch Of Gun Control Measures,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-gun-control_us_56608755e4b08e945fee73e5,Even one that would have stopped suspected terrorists from purchasing a gun.,2015-12-03,"Senate Democrats pushed to strengthen gun control laws, but to no avail.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566093c5210000dd005ac372.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- One day after 14 people were killed in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Senate Democrats pushed through votes on measures to strengthen gun control laws. Republicans succeeded in blocking every single one.In an effort to apply pressure on their GOP colleagues, Senate Democrats tried to change the focus of legislation aimed at repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood on the Senate floor Thursday. Their package attempted to strip out the text of the underlying bill and replace it with three measures that would have blocked individuals on terrorist watch lists from purchasing guns, expanded existing gun background checks, and increased funding for mental health services and treatment for substance abuse disorders. ""Our thoughts and prayers are not even close to enough. This country is dangerously close to falling into a new normal,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate's third-ranking Democrat. ""Is this the kind of country we want to be? Senate Democrats are not waiting one more day.""Democrats offered the package during a vote-a-rama on the GOP Obamacare bill. While every amendment failed -- they each needed to secure 60 votes -- Schumer said earlier in the day that the point of it all was to ensure the entire country knows where every senator stands on the issue. He predicted a ""good number"" of Republicans were ""dreading"" the votes. Regardless, the amendment meant to improve funding for services treating mental illness and substance abuse disorders failed in a 47-52 vote. The measure blocking individuals suspected of terrorism from purchasing guns and explosives failed 45-54. In what was primarily a party-line vote, a couple of senators defected. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) voted with Republicans against the amendment, while Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) joined Democrats in supporting it. The final gun control-related measure pushed by Democrats failed in a 48-50 vote. The amendment, offered by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), would have expanded background checks for people purchasing firearms at gun shows and on the Internet. It was the same bill Manchin introduced with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) in 2013 in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. Four Republicans, including Toomey, joined Democrats in voting for the measure on Thursday: Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), John McCain (R-Ariz.), and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) didn't vote.The attack in San Bernardino is the second mass shooting in the U.S. in the span of five days, and has drawn stronger cries from Democrats for Congress to act on meaty gun control legislation. Republicans in the House are taking a different tack. Many have been vowing to pursue legislation to reform the nation's mental health system after the deadly shooting at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado over Thanksgiving weekend. The political realities in Congress have made passage of expansive gun control legislation seemingly impossible. After reforms failed to pass in the aftermath of a devastating 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 children and six adults dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School, lawmakers have considered attempts to tighten the nation's guns laws a herculean task. ""Members of Congress don't get elected in order to send out sympathy tweets. Members of Congress get paid to change policy to make people safer,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said earlier Thursday. ""And what is so offensive, to those of us particularly who have lived through Sandy Hook, is it's not bad enough that we haven't passed any legislation to try to address these epidemic rates of gun violence, but in this Congress we are not even trying.""Admitting Senate Democrats may not have the votes to pass the legislation, Murphy said at least the amendments would show the public some senators are ""plugged into this disbelief"" over Congress' inaction. Wednesday's shooting at a social services center in San Bernardino is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. since Sandy Hook. In 2015 alone, there have been more mass shootings than there have been days, according to a count compiled by the Guns Are Cool community on Reddit. Questioned on the point of offering the amendments, given the division between the two parties in Congress, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) shot back.""You are basically saying, 'Why bother?'"" Boxer told reporters. ""That is not what leaders do. They don’t just hide because you may not win the vote. You keep doing it.""With success unlikely, Schumer hinted that Democrats would look to the year-end government spending bill, known as the omnibus, to try again. ""We are prepared to fight this in every place where we can make a difference and succeed,"" he said. This story updates an earlier version published prior to the Senate votes.Also on HuffPost:"
4,POLITICS,Democratic Senators Dare GOP To Vote Against Middle-Class Tax Breaks,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-middle-class_us_565f1a3ce4b079b2818cbb4b,The symbolic move will accompany the GOP's symbolic move to repeal Obamacare.,2015-12-03,"Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), along with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), proposed an amendment to enact two types of tax breaks for the middle class on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_99_5184_2814%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats will dare Republicans to vote against an expansion of tax credits for the middle class with an amendment that's intended to help married couples and people burdened by the high cost of child care. Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) are the lead co-sponsors for the amendment, first shared with The Huffington Post and introduced on Thursday. Senators will consider the measure alongside a broader spending bill Republicans are using to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act. The Democrats' amendment is almost guaranteed to face GOP opposition, so it's largely a symbolic move. That's fitting, since the Senate's Republican leadership has already admitted that the entire exercise of passing a bill to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement is itself symbolic.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday that he expects Democrats to offer a “very small” number of amendments, so this amendment is one of the few that will get consideration. Congress must pass a spending bill by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown.“If we enact these policies we will guarantee that these middle class families see their incomes go up, and we can do it in a fiscally responsible way that pays for these tax cuts by closing the most egregious tax loopholes,” Casey said in a statement. “Republicans, on the other hand, propose a number of steps that will make it harder for families to make ends meet, like gutting the ACA.”According to Casey’s office, the amendment would aid families by providing a 7 percent tax credit on up to $10,000 of the secondary earner’s income. Qualifying families would be able to directly reduce their income tax bill by up to $700. This new credit would also reduce earned income for purposes of calculating the Earned Income Tax Credit.Currently, parents are eligible to receive a credit of just $3,000 per child, and many low-income families don’t even qualify for the credit, so the second provision of Casey and Baldwin’s amendment would increase the maximum allowable expense limit for child care to $8,000, extend the maximum credit rate of 35 percent to all households making up to $110,000 a year, and make the credit fully refundable.The Democrats propose to pay for the tax credits by enacting the so-called “Buffett rule” to raise taxes on the wealthy, by closing an executive compensation loophole that enables corporations to claim outsized tax breaks by paying their executives in stock options, and by making it harder for companies to incorporate abroad to avoid paying U.S. taxes.Democrats have long sought such measures. Obama called on Congress to pass the Buffett rule in 2012, a year after billionaire investor Warren Buffett pointed out in a New York Times op-ed that rich people like him pay a smaller share of their income in federal taxes than middle-class taxpayers. The legislation would impose a 30 percent minimum tax on adjusted gross income for individuals making more than $1 million a year.Republican leaders have derided past incarnations of the Buffett rule as ""class warfare.""The second way the amendment would pay for the tax breaks would be by targeting a tax loophole passed in 1993 that allows corporations to deduct the value of stock options or other rewards for CEOs and executives from the company's taxable income, as long as the pay is “performance-based."" In practice, this means that the more the companies pay their executives, the less they pay in federal taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that closing the CEO pay loophole would save taxpayers $50 billion over 10 years. Democrats have proposed various bills to close the loophole, but none have gained traction.The final measure to pay for the tax credits would echo legislation that Democrats have already introduced, designed to reduce U.S. companies' incentives to buy foreign companies and transfer their main business operations abroad to avoid U.S. taxes. Burger King announced it would do so last year by taking over the Canadian coffee and doughnuts chain Tim Hortons. Such “inversions” cost taxpayers billions of dollars.Casey and Baldwin’s amendment would tighten rules for inverted companies, requiring that they be at least 50 percent foreign-owned, going beyond the current 20 percent rule. A company looking to invert by merging with a foreign company would have to merge with one at least as large as itself.The Democrats’ amendment is meant to test Republicans' sincerity when it comes to helping the middle class. During October's economy-focused Republican primary debate, the candidates brought up the middle class and workers repeatedly, even uttering the phrase “income inequality.” Democrats have argued that the GOP isn’t actually committed to helping the middle class, since many of the leading presidential candidates’ tax plans would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.In contrast, the leading Democratic presidential candidates -- former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- are debating progressive priorities like health care, child care and college, and how to pay for them. Clinton has proposed a new tax credit for families caring for aging parents and grandparents or people with disabilities, promising that she would only impose new taxes on the wealthiest Americans as president. Her campaign has criticized Sanders for proposing legislation that would provide universal, single-payer health care financed by a payroll tax increase, arguing that any tax increase on the middle class is unacceptable.Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The two Cleveland police officers involved in the November 2014 shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice had told investigators they believed he was a grown man with a gun, when in fact he was an adolescent with a replica gun. Summaries of what officers Timothy Loehman and Frank Garmback said happened in the moments before Loehman fired two shots that killed Tamir at a playground have been heard before, but this is the first time the public has seen their complete statements to the Cuyahoga County sheriff's office. The Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office shared the brief statements on Tuesday as part of an ongoing release of files from the controversial shooting. Each statement is a little more than a page long. In numerous points, Loehman, a rookie officer on probation, connects his actions with the training he'd received.""The suspect had a gun, had been threatening others with the weapon and had not obeyed our commands to show us his hands,"" Loehman wrote. ""This was an active shooter situation.""Many critics previously dismissed the officers' accounts and concluded that Tamir didn't appear threatening in a widely seen video of the shooting. Loehman claimed in his statement that he and Garmback repeatedly yelled at Tamir to ""show me your hands."" But the video showed the officer open fire within two seconds of emerging from the police cruiser driven by Garmback. Neither officer mentioned discovering that what appeared to them like a true firearm was an airsoft-type gun. Normally, pellet guns like this have brightly colored tips to distinguish them from real weapons, but Tamir's lacked the marking. Garmback, meanwhile, provided a terse recollection that didn't explicitly say that his partner shot Tamir. ""I saw the gun loose on the ground, a few feet from the male after he was shot. I moved it further away from him,"" he wrote. The two cops had rushed to Cudell Recreation Center after they heard on a broadcast that there was a black male there waving and pointing a gun at people.

7,BLACK VOICES,"In Brief Statement, Cleveland Cop Said He Thought Tamir Rice Was 'Active Shooter'",Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/statements-cleveland-cops-tamir-rice_us_565e2c01e4b072e9d1c3ee98,Statements from the two cops involved are so short that one doesn't even mention Tamir was shot.,2015-12-02,"A person holds up a sign for justice for Tamir Rice during a news conference on Dec. 8, 2014, in Cleveland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The two Cleveland police officers involved in the November 2014 shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice had told investigators they believed he was a grown man with a gun, when in fact he was an adolescent with a replica gun. Summaries of what officers Timothy Loehman and Frank Garmback said happened in the moments before Loehman fired two shots that killed Tamir at a playground have been heard before, but this is the first time the public has seen their complete statements to the Cuyahoga County sheriff's office. The Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office shared the brief statements on Tuesday as part of an ongoing release of files from the controversial shooting. Each statement is a little more than a page long. In numerous points, Loehman, a rookie officer on probation, connects his actions with the training he'd received.""The suspect had a gun, had been threatening others with the weapon and had not obeyed our commands to show us his hands,"" Loehman wrote. ""This was an active shooter situation.""Many critics previously dismissed the officers' accounts and concluded that Tamir didn't appear threatening in a widely seen video of the shooting. Loehman claimed in his statement that he and Garmback repeatedly yelled at Tamir to ""show me your hands."" But the video showed the officer open fire within two seconds of emerging from the police cruiser driven by Garmback. Neither officer mentioned discovering that what appeared to them like a true firearm was an airsoft-type gun. Normally, pellet guns like this have brightly colored tips to distinguish them from real weapons, but Tamir's lacked the marking. Garmback, meanwhile, provided a terse recollection that didn't explicitly say that his partner shot Tamir. ""I saw the gun loose on the ground, a few feet from the male after he was shot. I moved it further away from him,"" he wrote. The two cops had rushed to Cudell Recreation Center after they heard on a broadcast that there was a black male there waving and pointing a gun at people. Both officers said they believed that the 12-year-old was at least 18. Loehman said he saw Tamir pick up an object and stuff it into his waistband.

8,COLLEGE,National Fraternity Group Plans To Keep Up Lobbying Efforts,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nic-continue-lobbying_us_565e1bb8e4b079b2818c4e68,"Following ""constant media scrutiny,"" fraternities are plotting to launch a ""sophisticated"" public relations effort in the coming years.",2015-12-02,"Pictured: A Beta Theta Pi fraternity house. Judson Horras, a Beta Theta Pi member, is the current interim president of the North American Inter-fraternity Conference. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565e2db8170000b700e1adf3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The North American Inter-fraternity Conference will continue to make lobbying Congress ""an important aspect"" of the organization, and is plotting how to launch ""sophisticated public relations efforts"" on behalf of fraternities in the coming years, according to documents obtained by The Huffington Post. The NIC, an umbrella group for 73 men's fraternities, is scheduled to meet this week in Texas to discuss the NIC 2.0 Commission, an ongoing reform effort launched this fall. The commission was made up of fraternity executives from 30 organizations, and is set to recommend changes to the bylaws and standards of the conference, and to establish its key priorities this week. NIC's House of Delegates meeting, which starts Wednesday, plans to provide members with a full briefing on its current governmental relations strategy. Following deliberations at the meeting, NIC officials will set the ""conference's future governmental and legal affairs positions, policies, and resource allocations,"" according to the documents. A top NIC executive said Tuesday night that it would be premature to comment, because revisions have been made since paperwork was sent to members in early November. Further revisions are likely during the meeting in Texas, the executive said. Nevertheless, the documents offer insight into NIC workings. The materials obtained by HuffPost reveal a number of anxieties the groups face. The NIC in particular has received scrutiny in 2015 for a lobbying effort it helped lead in favor of controversial campus rape legislation from which it ultimately withdrew support after hundreds of sexual assault victims advocacy organizations protested it. One group, Lambda Chi Alpha, resigned its membership from NIC in October, citing ""counterproductive tactics."" The NIC prepared a white paper laying out challenges fraternities face and what they should do to overcome them. At the top, the white paper blames current fraternity woes on ""lack of human and financial resources,"" ""popularized social media platforms that damage the industry by glorifying 'frat' culture,"" ""intense and constant media scrutiny"" and increased regulation from both colleges and the government. These are ""drowning out the NIC's message and diminishing the NIC's ability to speak with a unified, powerful voice,"" the paper states.""We recognize that the problems fraternities face today cannot be blamed on the performance of the NIC,"" the NIC white paper adds. ""We acknowledge that these problems are often caused by some of our members' inability to self-govern and adhere to basic membership expectations."" The paper says the NIC will advocate for ""fraternity and student rights at the local, state and federal level."" The NIC also plans to consider a proposed ""Legal Advocacy Fund"" to recommend financial support of ""either pending or recommended litigation"" that supports the interests of fraternities. One of the big things the NIC says it needs to fix is a ""lack of a campus ground game,"" according to the documents. It has plans to create ""focus campuses"" where staff would be assigned from NIC to help coordinate efforts to ""build healthier fraternity communities."" Fraternities with chapters on focus campuses would have surcharges for this, starting at around $7,538 per member fraternity in 2016-17, and rising considerably in the coming years. According to the documents, the NIC plans to establish a staff for carrying out focus campus efforts. Focus campuses have not yet been determined, but could start with around five in 2016, and double in number each year after that. Increased educational programming, ""sophisticated public relations efforts to advance the 'Fraternity' brand"" and ""effective advocacy programs"" are needed to strengthen relationships with colleges and lawmakers, the NIC materials say. The documents note that fraternities' standards will change, though not dramatically from current NIC rules. One proposal stipulates members must carry commercial general liability insurance, and includes yet-to-be-determined changes to GPA standards.The NIC will also move toward a ""proportional voting model,"" essentially letting larger fraternities have more say, but additional details about the plan were not included in documents distributed to member organizations.

But advocates of full employment on Tuesday once again warned that higher rates will inflict unnecessary economic pain on working Americans.If, as expected, Fed officials raise the influential federal funds rate on Dec. 16, it will put downward pressure on economic demand, reducing potential job and wage growth. The central bank will have concluded, in such a scenario, that it must begin to put the brakes on the economy in order to prevent inflation from getting too high later.Several Democratic members of Congress, along with low-income workers, community activists and economists associated with the progressive Fed Up campaign, held a briefing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, arguing that a Fed interest rate hike next month would be premature. The event, attended by dozens of people -- most of them congressional aides -- was convened to promote a bill introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) in September, but it became a kind of public teach-in and rally in favor of expansionary monetary policy ahead of the Fed decision.“America needs a raise,” Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) said at the briefing, referring to a raise in pay, not interest rates. “That cannot happen without economic activity and a specific goal that we want unemployment down and wages up.”Sherman, who told Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen in November that God did not want interest rates to rise in the winter, explained his argument in more worldly terms on Tuesday. He insisted that the Fed should at least wait for the economy to grow enough that employers begin competing for workers by raising wages.“I look forward to hearing from the businesses in my community saying, ‘Oh my God, we can’t find the people we need.’ Then I’ll tell them, ‘Pay them more money,’” Sherman said.Sherman is one of 13 co-sponsors of Conyers' bill, which would prohibit the Fed from raising rates until the official unemployment rate is 4 percent or lower. Currently, the Fed has a dual mandate to maintain full employment and price stability through its adjustment of interest rates. The law permits the central bank to decide how it will achieve those goals.Progressive critics of the Fed, including Conyers and Sherman, say the broad discretion enjoyed by the central bank has enabled it to prioritize concerns about inflation over full employment. A decision to raise rates now would show too much sensitivity to the risks of future inflation, rather than the present sluggish wage growth, they say.While the official unemployment rate is down to 5 percent, wages grew at just 2.5 percent in the 12 months ending in October. Meanwhile, the consumer price index the Fed uses to assess inflation increased 1.3 percent over the same period -- well below the Fed’s 2 percent target.Many otherwise optimistic economists have wondered why wages have not grown faster, given the low unemployment.For Josh Bivens, the Economic Policy Institute’s research and policy director, however, the discrepancy is not a mystery. The low official unemployment rate conceals the degree to which workers have settled for part-time work when they want to work full time, or those who have given up looking for a job altogether.“This is not a puzzle,” Bivens said at the briefing on Tuesday. “It is the evidence for why it is too soon to start putting the brakes on the economy.”Top Fed officials do not appear to share those worries. Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee in November that she believed the economy was “performing well,” making a rate hike in December a “live possibility.” That was just days before October jobs numbers showed unusually high job growth, prompting a series of hints from other Fed decision-makers that a rate hike would be imminent, barring unforeseen economic changes.One reason Yellen has said the Fed is willing to raise interest rates before inflation reaches the 2-percent target is that the central bank wants to preempt its inflation target. She said she does not want the central bank to “slam on the brakes” by raising rates dramatically when inflation does cross a key threshold.The movement to lobby the Fed has yet to gain much traction in Congress. Still, Tuesday’s briefing shows activists' success in advancing the Federal Reserve as a key progressive battleground -- an accomplishment that would have been unthinkable just two years ago.The Fed Up campaign has, for example, made Fed policy a front in the fight for racial equality. Several economists and activists noted on Tuesday that people of color stand to lose the most if the Fed raises rates. African-Americans have an unemployment rate that is typically twice that of whites, making them especially sensitive to policies that allow unemployment to decline -- or prevent it from doing so.William Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO, prefaced a presentation on the role of discrimination in black unemployment by asking the audience to consider whether “black lives matter to the Federal Reserve.”But at bottom, briefing participants made clear that the progressive Federal Reserve movement was born out of circumstances not of their choosing. Setbacks in other areas -- lopsided trade deals, the decline of unions, the stagnation of the minimum wage and political resistance to fiscal stimulus -- have converged to stack the deck against workers, making it all the more essential that the Fed permit the economy to expand unhindered, they argued.“We are left with an economy that only generates wage growth when the economy is really, really tight,” Bivens said.Also on HuffPost:"

Wade decision, raising new questions about his commitment to opposing abortion rights.At a campaign rally here on Tuesday night, a man in the audience cited the infamous Kermit Gosnell case to question Trump about his abortion views. “You can see how when a bill is enacted as the Roe v. Wade thing, all of these things tend to decay, decay, decay and just devolve in this butchering we see now,” the man said. “Will you try to --""“Defund,” Trump said, referring to his position in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.The man in the crowd, however, wasn’t satisfied with Trump’s initial attempt to deflect the question. “Defund that, and repeal Roe v. Wade?” he asked the candidate.“Well, the answer is yes, defund,” Trump said. “The other, you need a lot of Supreme Court justices. But we’re gonna be looking at that also very, very carefully. But you need a lot of Supreme Court judges. But defund, yes, we’re going to be doing that.” Trump’s ambiguous comments on abortion stand in stark contrast to the hard-line declarations from the three GOP contenders who have been polling closest to Trump in recent national surveys -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). During an appearance on “Meet the Press” in October, Carson said that he would “love” to see Roe v. Wade overturned.Rubio has said that he does not support abortion rights, even in cases of rape or incest, and Cruz recently lauded an endorsement he'd received from Troy Newman, who has called for the execution of doctors who provide abortions.Trump’s own position on abortion has shifted dramatically over the years, even as it remains nebulous to this day.During his early decades in public life, Trump supported abortion rights, writing in his 2000 book The America We Deserve about his own “pro-choice instincts.”“I support a woman’s right to choose, for example, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures,” Trump wrote.Then, as he flirted with a Republican presidential run in advance of the 2012 election, Trump changed his position, characterizing himself as “pro-life” at the 2011 CPAC conference.But last summer, Trump said that his sister, Maryanne Trump Barry -- a federal appellate judge whom abortion rights opponents regard unfavorably -- would be a ""phenomenal"" Supreme Court justice. The GOP front-runner’s refusal on Tuesday to say whether he would take steps toward overturning Roe v. Wade drew a rebuke from the campaign of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R).“That is the answer a pro-choice politician who is pretending to be pro-life gives,” Bush’s communications director, Tim Miller, told The Huffington Post. “Jeb has a consistent, proven commitment to promoting legislation that would advance the pro-life cause and appointing reliably conservative justices.” Watch the video above to see Trump’s full remarks on whether he supports overturning Roe v. Wade. Also on HuffPost:"
12,POLITICS,Abortion Providers Are Too Scared To Even Talk About Security,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abortion-providers-security_us_565f2b2ae4b072e9d1c44f59,"""I won't say exactly what precautions our doctors take, because we do keep that pretty private.""",2015-12-02,"Colorado Springs shooting suspect Robert Lewis Dear Jr. appears via video for this first court appearance on Nov. 30, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- After a gunman opened fire at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs last week, killing three people, I wondered what new steps clinics would take to prevent similar attacks. So I asked Shannon Brewer, director of the Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only abortion clinic left in Mississippi, whether her doctors wanted to don bulletproof vests. She wouldn't say.""We do keep that pretty private,"" Brewer said. ""But every precaution that we can take, we are taking."" She also declined to say whether any staff members have concealed carry permits. ""That's part of our security, so I'd rather not answer that.”Brewer said her staff is accustomed to following safety precautions. But across the country, other abortion clinics are taking a closer look at their security measures, which have long been more stringent than other healthcare providers. The details of these plans are still largely top-secret, because staff members fear that revealing them could enable future attackers. Kathaleen Pittman, administrator of the Hope Medical Group for Women, an abortion clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, said the situation in Colorado was heartbreaking, but ""also heartbreaking is the amount of time and money spent on security rather than direct patient care."" ""I am angry I cannot speak candidly about our security measures, but I have to consider our patients and staff,"" she added. The risk is so substantial that in June, the medical director for Pittman's clinic had to hide behind a black curtain to testify on an admitting privileges law, and was referred to only as ""John Doe No. 3."" The precautions in place at the Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs may have saved lives. When alleged shooter Robert Lewis Dear Jr. attacked the clinic and entered into a lengthy standoff with law enforcement, employees moved patients through a secure door to a separate room, The New York Times reported. The clinic also reportedly had bulletproof vests and internal cameras that officers could access.Abortion clinics are prepared to deal with emergencies, said Vicki Saporta, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers. Prior to last week, there had been 8 murders, 17 attempted murders, 42 bombings, and 186 arsons at abortion clinics, Saporta said. ""Many clinics have bulletproof glass, and cameras and lighting and metal detectors and security entrance systems that are not common for other medical facilities,"" she said. (Saporta had not heard of staff having concealed-carry permits.) But the scope of the Colorado shooting, she said, ""takes things to a different level."" On Monday, Saporta's organization was sending out a security alert to clinics. ""Of course we don't want to give those specific details out, so anybody who wants to do them harm can figure out how to get around them,"" she said. Some clinics started ramping up security after the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, released heavily edited videos over the summer that purportedly showed that Planned Parenthood profits from the illegal sale of fetal issue. (The women's healthcare organization has strongly denied the claims.) Dear, the alleged Colorado shooter, may have referenced those videos when he was arrested. A law enforcement official reported that he said, ""No more baby parts."" The anti-abortion group has condemned the shooting.Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota began to review security this summer in wake of the videos ""because our opposition has become more emboldened than we've seen in the past,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Aulwes. In light of the Colorado shooting, she said, ""We are expediting any security enhancements and doing full security audits of all our sites.""Accessing health care ""should not mean bulletproof glass, safe rooms and bulletproof vests,"" said Mary Kogut, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri. But recognizing that extreme anti-abortion rhetoric may fuel violence, she added, ""We have security procedures and precautions.""When The Huffington Post called one abortion clinic to ask about security measures, the person who answered the phone said news of the shooting was ""very scary"" for staff, and that they had changed their security measures. The employee, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, also said that staff members have access to bulletproof vests, but declined to elaborate further. ""I'm afraid to,"" she said.Also on HuffPost:"
13,POLITICS,Here's What Cities Need To Do When Mass Killers Are On The Loose,Nick Baumann and Ryan J.

But unlike many mass shooters, the perpetrator or perpetrators of this crime weren't immediately caught. So what do San Bernardino police and other law enforcement agencies do now?San Bernardino County's emergency operations plan allows for ""curfew orders"" and other ""emergency regulations"" in the event of terrorism or other ""man-made hazards."" But before they take any drastic measures, officials first need to calm a scared public, says Leonard J. Marcus, who co-authored a white paper that examined the police response to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing as part of Harvard’s National Preparedness Leadership Initiative.“What they need right now is a lot of cooperation from a public that’s very frightened,” Marcus said.Constitutional restrictions mean that lockdowns in terrorist or active shooter situations are generally voluntary. ""Generally speaking the police will request -- and they do quite often when you have an active shooter -- that people stay in their homes,"" explained Scott Silliman, director emeritus of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke University. In these situations, police are asking the public for a favor -- and need the public's trust.Police in Boston did not face much resistance from civilians in the aftermath of the marathon bombing because of their proactive approach, Marcus said. “Because of the way that the leaders communicated through the media, the confidence that they established with the public, that people in the area where the manhunt was going on were very, very cooperative,” he said.Law enforcement officers also need to effectively use social media to distribute reliable information, especially because false reports will inevitably surface in such a chaotic situation. Senior law enforcement agencies that work in the area need to coordinate their activities quickly and set aside any rivalries.“It’s hard to know if you’re at the beginning of the event, the middle of the event, or at the end of the event,” Marcus said. “It’s going to be very difficult for them to assure the public about when it is going to be over, and it turns out time is a source of stress in a situation like this.”Sometimes officials turn to bizarre measures to keep the public out of harm's way. After the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968, Boston politicians used city funds to pay for a televised James Brown concert in hopes of preventing riots by keeping people at home, watching the tube.Even if the public cooperates with police measures, police themselves can create problems. ""More than 2,500 officers from New England and New York arrived in Watertown,"" Massachusetts, in response to the Boston bombing, ""many without orders to do so,"" the Boston Globe reported in April. The alleged perpetrator or perpetrators of Wednesday's crime may prove hard to track. Cops are looking for whoever supposedly left the scene in a black SUV. But there are many black SUVs in the greater Los Angeles area. Law enforcement can fairly easily track cell phone signals, but for that, they need to know which number or numbers to track, explained Ross McNutt, who runs Persistent Surveillance Systems, a company that uses aerial surveillance to help law enforcement solve crimes. There's no indication that cops know which cell phone signals belong to the attackers in this case -- or whether the attackers used cell phones at all. ""You'd need to have some cell phone record or some sort of item of interest"" to track, McNutt said. ""Otherwise you're in the same place, unfortunately, everyone else is."""

Tuesday marked the fourth annual charity event, which gives holiday revelers the chance to give back after feasting on Thanksgiving and nabbing up deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Supporters proved to be even more generous this season. Donors gave $39.6 million in online donations on Tuesday alone, up 52 percent from last year, Blackbaud, the technology provider that processes the majority of online donations on Giving Tuesday, told The Huffington Post.The firm waived administrative fees for any U.S. donations made through its crowdfunding platformBut those figures may tip closer to over $70 million as other groups continue publish the donations they processed, according to The NonProfit Times. Founded by the 92nd Street Y, in partnership with the United Nations, the charity day has become an international affair. The event boasted more than 30,000 partners in 68 countries. That included small businesses, nonprofits, government agencies and major corporations The event happened to have coincided with World AIDS Day, which aims to honor those who’ve lost their lives to the disease, and to help groups that are working to find a cure and provide medication and support. Supporters didn’t even necessarily have to give money to make an impact, though.(RED), a group that raises funds to fight AIDS, donated 10 days of lifesaving treatment each time supporters tweeted a video about the group. A number of organizations were pleased to have exceeded their Giving Tuesday goals.My Friend’s Place, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that serves homeless youth, surpassed its goal of raising $5,000, the group tweeted on Wednesday.The Innocence Project, a group that works to exonerate prisoners through DNA testing, doubled its fundraising goal on Tuesday and raised $20,000, the organization tweeted. Social media continued to serve as a means of galvanizing supporters, and thanking them for getting involved.“#GivingTuesday harnesses the potential of social media and the generosity of people around the world to bring about real change in their communities,” the organization said in a statement, “it provides a platform for them to encourage the donation of time, resources and talents to address local challenges. It also brings together the collective power of a unique blend of partners— nonprofits, civic organizations, businesses and corporations, as well as families and individuals—to encourage and amplify small acts of kindness.”"

17,POLITICS,9/11 Responders Crash Mitch McConnell's Office,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/911-responders-crash-mitch-mcconnells-office_us_565f182ce4b079b2818cb868,"The heroes called the Senate majority leader ""deplorable"" for stalling Sept. 11 legislation.",2015-12-02,"Paul Iannizzotto, a former New York firefighter, visited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office with two dozen other 9/11 responders.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565f4bfc170000ed00e1af29.jpeg?cache=55PmJDRQPl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The American flag outside the office of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) in the Russell Senate Office Building was hanging a little off-kilter Wednesday morning.So Paul Iannizzotto, a former New York City firefighter who was inside the north tower of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, when the south tower collapsed, didn't like the way it looked.""The pole was a little crooked, so I straightened it up,"" said Iannizzotto, 51, who also took care to make sure the folds of the nation's symbol draped properly after his rejiggering.Iannizzotto, whose lungs no longer fully function and who now lives in South Florida, was among two dozen 9/11 responders who paid an uninvited visit to McConnell's office, a day after learning the Kentucky senator was being blamed for stalling legislation to reauthorize the expiring James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.He didn't like what he heard from McConnell's staff, and the meeting was among the angriest that the cops, firefighters and construction workers can remember in years of pushing Congress to pay attention to the people who sacrificed themselves after the terrorist attacks.But Iannizzotto still felt the need to neaten McConnell's flag.""It's what you do. You see something that needs doing, you just do it,"" he said.The 2010 Zadroga legislation that created a treatment program for Americans sickened by the 2001 attacks expired in September, and the program is slated to close in 2016. That same law funded a compensation program that can only pay about half of what is required, and is set to expire next year as well.The responders want a permanent replacement. Bills that would give them one are backed by 66 senators and more than 250 members of the House, but neither has been allowed to advance. Still, it appeared Monday that a semi-permanent version extending health care and adding five years to the compensation program was about to be attached to the highway bill moving through Congress.But McConnell balked. Multiple sources told The Huffington Post he wanted to use the 9/11 provisions as leverage to get other items added to the bill, including a measure to lift the U.S. ban on oil exports.McConnell's office insists he did not block anything because there was no final 9/11 legislation written down on paper for him to accept. His spokesman also says that there are still negotiations going on across Capitol Hill over how to pay for it, although sources familiar with the talks said that funding streams were clearly identified and agreed to by relevant committee leaders.The situation infuriated the responders. And they think McConnell and many lawmakers are not doing the right thing, the thing Iannizzotti and his colleagues would do.""He wants to hold up our bill, and hijack it,"" said John Feal, a construction worker who lost half his foot at ground zero and launched the FealGood Foundation to advocate for 9/11 responders. ""It's deplorable. It's disgusting.""""It's sheer delay, delay, delay. They say they're for us -- the staff says they're for us -- then get it done,"" said Anthony Flammia, a former NYPD officer. ""We were here hoping to get a bill done. I mean, we're upset, we're visibly upset. It's typical, typical Washington, D.C., gridlock.""Richard Harmon, 59, has post-traumatic stress and a rare form of thyroid cancer that forced him to leave his job at Verizon. He was part of a crew that answered former President George W. Bush's demand to fix the wires in lower Manhattan and get Wall Street back online. Four other members of his crew also have cancer.He's ready to stop fighting.""I wanna go home. I've been doing this for months now. I want to just go home, be with my family, and live out whatever life God wants to give,"" Harmon said.Former NYPD Officer Kenneth Anderson can recite the names of his friends and colleagues killed by 9/11's toxins. He needs a wheelchair because his lung capacity is down to 30 percent. He's also ready to rest, but he said he can't until he knows his family is taken care of.""I don't need to bankrupt my family on my way out of this world,"" he said. For Iannizzotto, who lost five members of his lower Manhattan engine company on Sept. 11, the idea that a 9/11 bill has been trapped in a round of Capitol Hill horse trading is especially hard to take.It says to him, that in spite of the annual exhortations by politicians to never forget Sept. 11, they have.""I've got stickers on my truck that say 'Never forget.' I sign everything, 'Never forget.' Ya can't forget, but they do. That's why we're here. That's why we're here today,"" he said, tears welling in his eyes.He turned back toward McConnell's flag to get control of his emotions.""I'm sorry,"" he said, as if he were the one who needed to apologize.Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, came out later Wednesday in favor of permanently extending the health care program, which is in the jurisdiction of his committee.“The first responders who selflessly answered the call on 9/11 and their loved ones have gone through enough and the last thing they need to worry about is Congress playing games with vital health benefits they have duly earned by their sacrifice,” said Upton in a statement announcing his plan. “Let’s end the uncertainty by permanently and responsibly extending this critical program.""Democrats in the House took his position as a positive sign, but were concerned about how it would be paid for, absent the funding sources that would have been in the highway bill. Upton's new proposal calls for cuts to Medicaid, including ferreting out abuse and taxing millionaires, to raise the money.Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.

18,POLITICS,Congress Is About To Hand This Bank A Ridiculous Gift,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emigrant-savings-bank-highway-bill_us_565e1967e4b072e9d1c3d10a,Billionaire donors were involved.,2015-12-02,"The Emigrant Savings Bank on East 43rd Street April 6, 2009 in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565f15241b0000d80029ef81.jpeg?cache=7xvSqFvLUg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The biggest winner from a bipartisan highway funding deal hammered out by congressional negotiators on Tuesday isn't a Republican, a Democrat, or even the nation's roadways. It's Emigrant Savings Bank.A single line slipped into the package will help the Manhattan-based lender dodge a rule from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law designed to prevent large and mid-sized banks from relying too heavily on borrowed cash. Emigrant is literally the only firm affected by the change.The provision has nothing to do with repairing roads and bridges, of course. It doesn't even help lawmakers come up with money to pay for that construction. It only helps Emigrant boost its profit ratios by operating with more borrowed money.The Emigrant bank aid won't damage the economy. The bank holds less than 1 percent of the assets owned by multi-trillion-dollar behemoths like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America. But Congress could grant multimillion-dollar favors to just about anyone without risking a banking panic. There's a reason why legislators granted it to a bank controlled by a billionaire family.Emigrant is owned by the Milsteins -- real estate kingpins who have been power players in New York state politics for decades. Bank Chairman Howard Milstein bundled funds for President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, and convinced then-Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) to introduce an earlier version of the one-sentence bill in 2012 after making a $2,500 contribution to his campaign. The bill faded away after garnering a host of bad press, and lost its chief advocate when Grimm pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud and resigned his office in January.But the Emigrant largesse didn't stop with Grimm. Bank vice chairman Harriet Edelman has given $3,000 to Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) since the 2014 elections. Over the same time period, Howard Milstein, his wife Abby and their son Michael have given $16,200 to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and $5,400 to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). In the 2012 cycle, Howard and Abby gave $10,000 to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).Such campaign finance figures are typically associated with shepherding a bill through a committee -- not ensuring that they actually become law. But Shelby, Wyden, Schumer and Brown all were all part of the highway bill negotiating team. After Democrats fought off GOP efforts to defang broader Dodd-Frank policies, they let the Emigrant provision slide.Highway bill negotiators are betting their colleagues in Congress won't jeopardize a bipartisan infrastructure project over a policy change that happens to help Emigrant juice its capital without creating other problems.Potentially more destructive efforts at targeted, opportunistic sleaze almost made it into the highway bill. As recently as Monday night, the bipartisan deal included a major change to the Franklin D. Roosevelt-era Trust Indenture Act that would have rewritten bankruptcy standards to help Education Management Corp. -- one of the nation's largest for-profit college operators that just agreed to pay $95.5 million to settle a fraud case with the Department of Justice. The change would have altered bondholder rights in order to help EDMC slough off debt outside of bankruptcy court. The for-profit school is desperate to avoid a formal bankruptcy filing, which would strip it of the federal funding that constitutes a significant portion of its revenue -- thanks to government-backed student loans.Those changes could have had repercussions well beyond a single student lender -- potentially hammering pension funds and investors in other distressed firms.""One basic rule of thumb is, don't fuck with laws passed in the 1930s,"" said a Democratic Senate aide. ""They were usually passed to fix a problem that led to the Great Depression.""The EDMC bailout failed. But a few other changes to consumer law survived.The final highway bill authorizes banks to barrage the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with applications to be exempted from key mortgage standards adopted after the financial crisis. The CFPB already allows rural lenders leeway on the rules, but as a result of the highway bill, any bank that does not operate in a region the agency designates as rural can apply for rural status anyway. That allows bank lobbying groups to coordinate application drives to inundate the agency with paperwork, eating up its resources and hamstringing its enforcement efforts. Money for federal highway funding typically comes from a gas tax. But inflation has gradually eroded the power of that tax, which hasn't been increased since 1993. Instead of raising that tax to pay for new highway work, the bill raids other programs, and embarks on at least one pointless new revenue-generation project.Private debt collectors will soon be haranguing people with delinquent IRS bills thanks to another provision. IRS agents don't currently expend much energy pursuing many overdue tax accounts, because an agency analysis of 2013 tax data found that 79 percent of such cases involved people essentially too poor to pay. So while private debt collectors will get a slew of contracts with the federal government, consumer advocates say the project will result in lots of harassment, but little revenue.The highway bill also raids a fund that the Federal Reserve uses to help it conduct ordinary monetary policy operations. The legislation saps two-thirds of the fund in order to come up with about $20 billion in funding. But as ex-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has noted, the move is really just an accounting trick that makes the central bank's job harder without actually saving the government any money. The Fed tapped its surplus fund 158 times between 1989 and 2001, according to a 2002 GAO report on the fund.None of these riders are going to create the next financial panic, or force thousands of kids to go hungry. That's why they're unlikely to impede the highway bill's progress to enactment.Hey, at least it's bipartisan.Zach Carter is the Huffington Post's Senior Political Economy Reporter and a co-host of the politics podcast 'So That Happened.'

The final text was released to the public this fall, after being treated as classified information.Supporters of the pact say it will expand U.S. exports and check China's growing global economic influence, pointing to enforceable labor and environmental standards included in the deal.But the U.S., including the Obama administration, has never effectively enforced labor or environmental standards in trade pacts, and the Sierra Club report concludes that the broader effects of the deal will overwhelm the narrow environmental language intended to deter illegal wildlife and timber trading.Much of TPP's negative impact on climate change will come from outside the chapter dedicated to the environment. The Sierra Club said the deal will encourage fracking by expanding natural gas exports, eliminate tariffs on coal, shift industrial manufacturing activity to countries with poor pollution controls and empower corporations to challenge environmental regulations before an international tribunal.""The TPP poses a panoply of threats to our climate and environment,"" the report reads, calling TPP a ""polluter-friendly model"" for international trade.The report comes as Obama has been pressing for bold, coordinated international action to combat climate change at a major conference of world leaders in Paris, serving as a reminder that many environmental groups believe Obama's trade platform may undercut his other efforts.The Sierra Club has been one of the most persistent critics of the trade pact through years of negotiations, along with Doctors Without Borders, Public Citizen and American labor unions. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been among the TPP's supporters, although some corporate interests, including the pharmaceutical industry and Big Tobacco, have been disappointed in the final text. Congressional Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have generally opposed TPP, as have many tea party Republicans. Obama and GOP leaders have strongly backed the deal.During negotiations over the text, the Obama administration frequently vowed to include unprecedented labor and environmental protections in the final deal. But the administration raised hackles among human rights watchdogs when it upgraded Malaysia's human trafficking rating in order to include the country in the deal -- despite the discovery of a mass grave for human trafficking victims in Malaysia earlier this year. While most environmental groups had opposed the pact, a few, including Defenders of Wildlife, have supported the deal on the grounds that it would curb illegal trafficking in endangered species. Defenders of Wildlife switched its position after the text was released.""It is disappointingly clear that this is not the tougher language we had hoped for,"" said Defenders of Wildlife President and CEO Jamie Rappaport Clark. ""The environment chapter is weak."" TPP's fate lies not with environmental groups, but rather with congressional Republicans, who control both the House and the Senate. Over the summer, Congress granted TPP fast-track status, barring lawmakers from amending or filibustering the final agreement.Read the full Sierra Club report here."
