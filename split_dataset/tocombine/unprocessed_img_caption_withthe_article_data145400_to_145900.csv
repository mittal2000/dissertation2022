That's the question that,2013-08-23,"This photo provided by Food and Drug Administration shows Arena Pharmaceutical's anti-obesity pill Belviq. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Belviq, the first new prescription drug for long-term weight loss to enter the U.S. market in over a decade. The agency cleared the pill Wednesday for adults who are obese or are overweight with at least one medical complication, such as diabetes or high cholesterol.

That's the question that senior doctor Sidney M. Wolfe, MD, founder of the health research group Public Citizen, is asking in a new paper published in the journal BMJ after the FDA approved two weight-loss drugs that the European Medicine Agency (EMA), the European equivalent of the FDA, rejected due to concerns over side effects.The drugs, Belviq and Qsymia, were both approved in the United States last summer, despite the concerns over side effects, including heart disease and depression, which led to both drugs being repeatedly denied by the EMA. More from Everyday Health: 10 Cognitive Distortions 8 Ways to Avoid Anaphylactic Shock 8 Unexpected Times You Could Get Sick""Are Americans more resistant to the risks and more likely to benefit from certain drugs than Europeans?"" Dr. Wolfe asks in the paper, ""Or, on the contrary, is the European Medicines Agency more resistant than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to the drug industry's desire to get approval for drugs with unique risks but without compensating benefits?""Belviq showed a 16 percent increased risk of heart failure compared to a placebo, and resulted in 3 percent more weight loss, according to the paper. Similarly, 4.2 percent of patients on Qsymia experienced heart arrhythmia, compared to only 1.8 percent of patients on a placebo. The FDA noted these risks when they approved the drugs.""There's probably not sufficient data at this time to rule out a clinically meaningful increase in the risk for valvular heart disease,"" the FDA said in their report when they approved Belviq.Although the FDA approved the drugs, they did not push them through blindly. The FDA mandated further research on the negative heart effects of the drugs, but only after the drug hit the market. However, Gopal Chopra, MD, an associate professor of health sector management at Duke University in North Carolina, said those studies should have been performed first, even with the obesity rate rising rapidly.""Obesity doesn't need an urgent solution, because it's not going to kill you in the next hour,"" Dr. Chopra said. ""If we stop eating, we lose weight. The FDA should have been more judicious in approving these drugs.""But just because the drugs require further research doesn't mean that doctors shouldn't prescribe them, Chopra said.""Every prescription needs to be tailored to the patient,"" he said. ""Physicians need to balance the risks and benefits and figure out what's best for the patient.""Unfortunately, Chopra added, most doctors are unable to effectively understand all of the risks.""I would prescribe the drugs, but I would prescribe them with a team,"" he said. ""It needs more than just a prescribing physician. It needs a dietitian, an obesity specialist and other doctors all working together. If we all agree that the patient needs the drug, I would prescribe it.""The FDA did not respond to a request for comment.""Anti-Obesity Drugs Should Not Have Been Approved, Expert Says"" originally appeared on Everyday Health."

The financial stress that comes with having children home for the summer. Forty-six percent of people surveyed said they experience an increase in financial pressure during summer, which stems from paying for childcare and taking pricey family vacations, among other causes.Marilyn Stowe, the senior partner at Stowe Family Law, said that another reason parents consider splitting up more frequently after summer vacation is that they don't want to ruin their kids' school breaks with a divorce.“Our experience, based on the clients we see at our offices across the country, is that parents may give their marriages 'one final go' over the holidays, or delay any proceedings until the children are back at school because they don’t wish to spoil the family’s break,"" Stowe said. “The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. I suspect that a relationship in trouble may be too damaged to be rescued by a holiday -– but can easily be broken by it.”It's not the first time a study has looked at what drives people to split. Earlier this month, a Swedish study found that people who commute to work at least 45 minutes each way are more likely to divorce then people with shorter commutes. And a recent study out of Kansas State University found that couples who argue about finances, particularly early in their partnerships, face a greater risk of divorce.Click through the slideshow below to see even more fascinating divorce research.Keep in touch!

6,FOOD & DRINK,Award-Winning Mixologist Charlotte Voisey Talks Dinner Cocktails,"Quia Querisma, Contributor
I'm just a nice lady who likes cocktails and traveling.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/awardwinning-mixologist-c_us_5b9d739fe4b03a1dcc8828a7,"The idea of being paid to travel the world and speak to the masses about the delights of alcohol brands like Henrick's Gin, Glenfiddich, Balvenie and Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum sounds like the stuff a lush's dreams are made of, but it's serious business.",2013-08-22,2013-08-21-WGSPortfolioAmbassadorCharlotteVoisey21.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-21-WGSPortfolioAmbassadorCharlotteVoisey21.JPG," William Grant & Sons Brand Ambassador, Charlotte VoiseyThe idea of being paid to travel the world and speak to the masses about the delights of alcohol brands like Henrick's Gin, Glenfiddich, Balvenie and Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum sounds like the stuff a lush's dreams are made of, but it's serious business. Charlotte Voisey, an award-winning British mixologist was snapped up by William Grant & Sons to do exactly that. A leader in her field, Voisey was recognized by the James Beard Foundation for her contributions to mixology, and is currently one of the key brand ambassadors William Grant & Sons has tapped for an exciting partnership with Ruth's Chris Steakhouse that is bringing cocktails back to the dinner table.What would you say would separates a mixologist from a traditional bartender?There's a couple of things. I think the age that we're living now, with the resurgence of the cocktail, mixologist has come to represent somebody who takes a bit more care in the drink itself. It's someone who researches, attends seminars, actually locks into favorite combinations, tries around drinks at home or at the bar and creates some cocktails, whereas a bartender traditionally is somebody that works in a bar.I was a bartender for many years and then seven years ago I stopped being a bartender and began working for William Grant & Sons, the company I work for now, to educate by opinions, to teach seminars, to promote the spirits of William Grant. I see myself now as a mixologist because I still create drinks, I still research, I still learn, but what I don't have any more is the element of serving people in one fixed bar.Tell me a little bit more about how you happened into that role and what it entails?It was seven years ago that I was hired and it was when I was still running a cocktail bar in London, in the UK where I'm from. At the time, London had just gone through a cocktail resurgence, meaning that people got more into mixology, started learning more about better mixing drinks and the whole scene kind of completely revamped itself. That had not happened yet in America, so the company that I work for now approached me with the idea that by hiring a bartender they could try and bridge the gap between a traditional supplier relationship and the bartender community.That's really how it all came about and the role has developed into brand ambassador which really means, education, promoting the brand so that it makes sense to the audience, whether it's the bartender audience or general public audience, so essentially my role is to educate, promote the brands and essentially make people fall in love with them as much as I love them.I haven't yet seen the video showing at the Ruth's Chris Steak House dinner, so what should guests anticipate?It's really awesome what they've done at Ruth's Chris. It's a great restaurant company that has its roots in New Orleans, which is also very important for cocktail culture. It's a great partnership, so for the first time then over 70 locations in the country people will sit down to a cocktail dinner, to rather than fill a table with wine. We've actually had five courses with different cocktails, which for most people is a bit of a stretch. They're not used to drinking cocktails with food, especially throughout the meal.What people can expect is looking at drinks and seeing how styles of drinks as well as intensity of how strong they are and the intensity of flavor actually compare with food. When you craft a cocktail, you have the opportunity to absolutely match it with the food dish because there's no rules, there's no limits, there's no ingredients that you must use or can't use. With wine, the wine is already made, so you just have to find the best fit, whereas if it's cocktails, you can actually create the exact fit, so it's kind of exciting.I imagine people that study mixology and craft cocktails on their own, they're foodies in their own way, would you agree?Yes, absolutely. Of course, both have appreciation of flavor and I think that's the exciting part right now. People are understanding that the drinks that we used to have before dinner were actually too strong or too sweet and they're killing our pallets before sitting down for a nice meal. When you understand that cocktails play an important part in the dining experience, it gets more fun.If someone wanted try to prepare cocktails at home which are some of the easiest recipes to start with?You probably want to look at some aperitifs like the Negroni [which] is a classic gin aperitif. It's a cocktail from Italy from the 1930s. It's really simple because it's three ingredients -- gin, Campari or Aperol and sweetener -- and it's literally those three ingredients in equal proportions, one ounce of each and then stir it over ice with a slice of orange. That's a neat one because there's little room for error, but as long you stir it properly with ice you get a little dilution and it's actually quite a soft beautiful aperitif for food.Quia Querisma is a digital marketer by day, freelance writer by night, and a traveler by nature.

You?",2013-08-22,Little 4 years old girl embarrassed while eating her chocolate fudge,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d742f2000002d00fdf8d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Someone once told me that shame isn't something we're born with, it's something we learn. This was never more true for me than the first time I pulled a matzah, peanut butter and jelly sandwich out of my lunchbox in the school cafeteria. My school, Puesta del Sol, located on a dusty mesa called Rio Rancho, New Mexico, was predominantly Catholic, as is much of the rest of my home state. I wasn't quite prepared for the fact that that ""crackers sandwich,"" as my friends called it, would lead me to have to explain for the first time that I didn't celebrate Christmas. Have you ever seen a seven-year-old try to explain the nuances of Judaism's perspective on Jesus to other seven-year-olds? The next day, I requested that the matzah be left out of my lunch. This conversation about food shame isn't unique to me, to Passover, to dusty mesas -- it happens to all of us at some point. We spend a lot of time here reflecting on the strength, the clarity, the memories that our food culture affords us. It's probably time we talked about the ways it embarrasses the hell out of us. A recent Texas Monthly article, ""The Most Important Taco of the Day,"" discusses the inevitability of the breakfast taco's rise to breakfast and brunch fame, and how crazy it is that it hasn't already happened. We're talking about a taco (arguably one of the human race's best edible creations), stuffed with eggs, bacon, cheese, occasionally potatoes and usually salsa. Even for the most culturally cautious palate, that's a pretty familiar collage. What could possibly be contributing to the fact that every diner in America doesn't list breakfast tacos on their menu? Robert Vasquez, of the Tamale House in Austin, says maybe food shame.You wanna know what it was like as a kid eating tacos? If I took tacos to school, everyone would say shame on you. There was a lot of shame eating a taco back then. You had to hide them. You couldn’t eat them in front of nobody. And this was among a school that was 80 to 90 percent Anglo and very few Mexicans. So I had to hide my food. But now, 80 to 90 percent of Anglos eat tacos! I would say 80 to 90 percent of my customers are Anglo. And they eat tacos like they’ve never had anything before in their life! So things have changed. I think to myself, I remember a time when I would get made fun of. And now everybody’s eating tacos. It’s not just Mexicans anymore.I found this article via Slate, via a friend on Facebook, Matt Pennington, who posted it because it reminded him of his childhood. His mother was ashamed of tortillas, while he was always proud.My mother was the oldest of five in a blue collar family with one special needs child. There wasn't a lot of extra cash around. So, for her, there weren't any options for lunch except tortillas. In her mind, they marked her as poor or impoverished. I, on the other hand, was a latchkey kid in a middle class family. I'd steal tortillas out of the fridge every chance I got. Especially the homemade ones. Those tasted like my grandmother' s kitchen and too much was never enough. Especially the more middle class we became.I already know that this is not specific to the southwestern US. I know that, in part, because of Francis Lam. At 2013's Southern Food Writing Conference, Lam told a story about a pork chop. Not just any pork chop -- a Chinese-style pork chop with pickles that he'd procured on a much-desired, fondly-recalled lunch with his father. The next day, he'd excitedly warmed up leftovers in the microwave at his parents' New Jersey business. Just as he was about to tuck in, a business-man, dressed in a suit, with what may have been an English accent walked in. Abruptly, he said, ""What is that dreadful smell?"" He knew it was the pork chop. He threw it away without eating it. ""I realized -- that's what shame was,"" Lam told us.I've been thinking about what he meant ever since. I knew that I'd felt this food shame before, but until that moment didn't really consider whether it was universal. I asked around the office, the answers were nearly immediate. ""Steak Tartare,"" said Julie Thomson, Associate Editor at HuffPost Taste. ""My parents are from Belgium where this dish is as common as fries. We ate it about once a week at my house. It was always horrifying when my mom decided to make it when a friend was over for dinner. (She did this of course because she considered it a treat.) But how do you explain to a 10-year-old that they have to eat raw meat for dinner?"" It isn't only our own culture that occasionally makes us wish we could turn inside-out, sometimes it's our appropriations of the other ones. Kristen Aiken, Senior Editor at HuffPost Taste is head-over-heels in love with a cake her mother makes -- as long as you don't ask what it's called.I come from a VERY churchgoing family, and my mother is basically the Protestant Mother Teresa. And though she's generally a horrible cook, she has mastered a few things -- one of them being something called Jewish Apple Cake. I eat it like a maniac because it's so insanely good, but whenever someone asks me what I'm eating, saying ""Jewish Apple Cake"" makes me feel like a complete fraud and I get weirdly self-conscious.Even I had to grill her on what made it ""Jewish."" So far we've determined that it has apples in it? Who knows how these things get translated over the years. I'd begun to notice a pattern, the shame we feel surrounding food also has to do with our desire to protect our culture and our family traditions. Nearly all of these stories originate in the storyteller's youth. We have to learn as kids to defend the soft shell of who we are against the prods of the outside world. That was, until our Editorial Fellow, Nile Cappello, spoke up. ""This has more to do with what I didn't eat,"" she began. ""Since my entire family is Sicilian and proud, my relatives were always stunned by my eating habits. I didn't eat marinara sauce growing up and don't drink coffee, while my cousins were begging for it before the age of five. I ate a ton of rice cakes and vegetables (as an infant my mom used to spoon-feed me fresh avocados), and my extended family could be hard on my parents because we were the 'healthy California' part of the family.""Guys, this means that even our own families can be enemy combatants in the food shame war. But it also means that the cultural integrity we're protecting is our own, individual of our family's preferences, our education, what our parents had or didn't have. That means that along with being born with our own sense of taste, we're also born with the desire to protect that taste. It's why picky eaters hate getting called out at the dinner table and why someone will avoid trying something for decades because they're afraid they won't like it. Am I saying we're all onions? Yes, I guess I am saying we're all onions. But I'm also starting to believe that we're all singularly equipped to teach one another something about food -- which, of course, has the inevitable flip-side that we can all learn something, food-wise, from one another. And although these stories of food shame clearly carry some pretty heavy psychic weight for all of us, maybe they exist to teach us what we think, as individuals, is worth standing up for about ourselves. I can tell you now, without question, that I'm prepared to lobby for the integrity of breakfast tacos, tortillas, Chinese pork chops, steak tartare and avocados from a spoon. Matzah? Maybe still not so much.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "

His latest endeavor isn't quite as groundbreaking as all that -- but it's still pretty epic.This week, the chef opened a new restaurant called Burke's Bacon Bar in Chicago's River North neighborhood, which is as close to an all-bacon restaurant as ever opened in the United States. (Prior to Burke's Bacon Bacon, the only ""plans"" for an all-bacon restaurant came in the form of a news story about one such restaurant that was allegedly supposed to open up in Atlanta back in '09. But since this restaurant never actually opened, and the news story in question was published on April 1st, we're guessing that this idea remained laughably implausible until very recently. Canada, however, got the first all-bacon restaurant in North America, a sandwich place called Rashers, last year. In addition, several all-bacon food trucks have roamed the streets of various cities around America at various points, but that's not really the same thing.)The restaurant's menu includes nine mini-sandwiches, eight of which contain bacon. The last one, Smoked Eggplant Meatball Parmesan is vegetarian by default... but you can add bacon for $1. It also serves a few sides, desserts and salads, about half of which contain bacon. In other, not unrelated news, the price of bacon hit an all-time high, even adjusted for inflation, this past July. The average price of a pound of cured pork belly was more than $5 for the first time in history. Will the madness ever end?Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

CORRECTION: This post has been amended to note the fact that the news story about ""Bacon-alia,"" the all-bacon restaurant in Atlanta, was published on April Fool's Day, and so was only, in all likelihood, a clever prank. We're sorry to have missed the joke the first time around! It was funny!"

But in a new interview with The Border Mail, an Australian newspaper, she revealed that she has found happiness again.When a reporter for the paper asked the actress if she is happier now post-split, Kidman hesitated for a moment before answering in the affirmative.""Yes,"" said. ""Happy in the sense that I have my girls and my husband and I have a very, very strong real life to counter-balance my fantasy life now. My fantasy life used to outweigh that more and now I've kind of balanced it, which is a lot healthier."" And although The Border Mail reports that Kidman's PR person whisked her out of the room after that question, the actress turned back to assure the reporter of her happiness: ""I smile now!"" she said.Kidman has been married to country star Keith Urban since June 2006, and the couple has two daughters together. Kidman and Cruise married in 1990 and divorced in 2001.
