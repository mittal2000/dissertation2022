Or plan for a few small meals to fend off inevitable meltdowns? For my kids and me, I've found it's best to snack -- with a caveat. When we snack, we choose high protein snacks.The list of healthy, high protein snacks is long, but we have a few favorites that regularly appear at our family table (and in our lunchboxes). They share four basic characteristics: Snacks have to be healthy, easy to make, portable, and packed with protein.Beans Beans are my best friends when it comes to high protein snack satisfaction. Edamame comes in its own perfectly portable package. It doesn't get much easier than that. Chickpeas are another high protein bean on our list of snack favorites. Blended into a healthy homemade hummus, they are a delicious complement to fresh cut veggies and fruits.Nuts and Seeds Nuts can get a bad rap because they are high in calories, but they are a good source of protein. Even better, they're packed with omega-3 fats--the kind of fat that healthy bodies need. Although it's better to source your omega-3 fats from fish, nuts provide another helpful source according to Walter Willett, Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology at Harvard's School of Public Health. Walnuts top our list, and we usually enjoy them with something equally crunchy like an apple. Simple and easy. For kids with nut allergies, seeds can offer similar benefits. Our school is nut free, so our healthy protein snack of choice is an easy no bake cookie made with sunflower seeds, honey and oats. Greek Yogurt One simple switch we made was to replace regular yogurt with Greek yogurt. This shift boosted our protein intake without much effort at all. Greek yogurt offers nearly double the protein per serving as it's regular yogurt counterpart. For example, a one-cup serving of Straus non-fat Greek yogurt offers 20g of protein. A same size serving of Straus non-fat plain yogurt offers 14g of protein. Serve it up with homemade granola and a drizzle of maple syrup, or blended into a fruity pineapple smoothie, reminiscent of a Piña Colada.   What are your favorite high protein snacks? I'd love to hear your suggestions.A mother of two, Jennifer Tyler Lee is the creator of the award-winning healthy eating game, Crunch a Color®, and author of the upcoming book tentatively titled, The 52 New Foods Challenge (Penguin/Avery 2014), a week-by-week playbook to get your family eating healthy, one new food at a time."

2,PARENTING,The Sound of Silence: Parenting As an Introvert,"Kristen Levithan, Contributor
Writer and blogger, Motherese",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-sound-of-silence-parenting-as-an-introvert_us_5b9d8812e4b03a1dcc892f4c,I've done my best to plan at least a few minutes alone in every day -- even if they don't come until the kids are asleep and the dishes are done. And it helps. Knowing what you need and asking for it often does.,2013-10-15,<strong>2. Introverts don't like to be around people. </strong>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d88112500003300367f82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"About 10 minutes ago, I bent down once, twice, three times to pay out hugs to three small people. I stood on my tiptoes to offer a kiss to my husband. He opened the door then and pushed the magic button on his car key that opens the doors of the minivan. The kids -- their backpacks (blue, pink, Star Wars Lego) nearly eclipsing them -- shuffled off to their seats.""Bye, Mommy!"" they called.""Bye, babe,"" my husband smiled as he shut the door from the house to the garage.Click, click, click. Sliding door closed, sliding door closed. Driver's door open, driver's door closed. Automatic garage door up. Ignition on. Van easing down the driveway. Automatic garage door closed.Quiet.It's 8:19 a.m. and I am alone in my house for the first time in months.I head for the kitchen and wrap up the rest of a tomato I'd sliced for sandwiches. I empty the remains of a bowl of Cheerios into the sink and sip my now-cold green tea. I open the window and welcome the crisp breeze, the chirping birds hidden in the trees. I breathe in the babble of the creek that runs next to my house.All of a sudden, my life has become a spa soundtrack. Bliss.---Until I read Susan Cain's brilliant Quiet, I did not realize just how strongly introverted I am and how much more introverted I have become as I've gotten older. (Indeed, on the quiz that Cain includes in her book, I answered 11.5 of the 12 questions as an introvert would.) I knew that I increasingly thought of cocktail parties as one of Dante's lower circles of Hell. I knew that I almost always preferred communicating in writing to talking on the phone. But I didn't recognize how deeply I valued quiet, how much I needed a daily infusion of silence to stay sane.The trick, of course, is that I have little kids, now 6, 4 and 2. And they have a drum set. And a giant bin of Legos that they rifle through to find just the right piece. And their job at this moment of their lives is to play and to explore, and making noise is an essential part of that process of discovery. Children are meant to be seen and heard.As much as it helps to understand that I am an introvert, after reading Cain's book, I knew I needed to find a way to reconcile my need for quiet with the realities of my days. (Those quiet mornings alone at home? Few and far between.) So, the last few years have been an exercise in making my kid-filled life more introversion-friendly. I've traded in teaching for writing. I've bought a white noise machine to keep on my desk to drown out drumbeats and Lego crashing when I'm working and my husband is watching the little ones. I've pursued exercise that's either solitary or quiet or both (running and yoga top the list). I've done my best to plan at least a few minutes alone in every day -- even if they don't come until the kids are asleep and the dishes are done.And it helps. Knowing what you need and asking for it often does.---I carry my tea mug over to the kitchen island and open my laptop. I reply to a few emails and jot down a list of things to do until preschool pickup at 12:30: edit query letter, work on book review, email client, send invoice. I open up a Word document and start typing, but soon find my index finger creeping toward the mouse pad. It finds the Picasa icon and clicks on it and I smile at the pictures from my son's birthday party this past weekend. I play a video of my children -- joined by their grandfather -- chanting, ""We want cake! We want cake!"" I turn the volume up a little.I think I might just miss the noise.

I don't know. I'm not really a ring person, I guess. And I plan to eat a lot, so...To be fair, we've been married eight years, and she was recently engaged. I totally recall being newly engaged and beginning all my conversations with a subtle face touch and giggle as my hand caught the sunlight coming through the window.But how will people know you're married?I guess I don't care if they do?Is that horrible? I love being married, and I adore being in love. But, somewhere along the line, the ring stopped meaning married, and it just meant pretty ring.I had more tangible definitions. Like the three small kids who wander around our house. Or the familial melting pot on our Holiday Party invitation guest list. Or the ugly f*cking couches I let inhabit my home.I remember when I was pregnant with Wyatt and the day before baby Jude's baptism, about 80 lbs. too big for my ring, I went out and bought a fake cheap wedding band, because in my head, the thought of showing up in church without it was out of the question. I was pregnant and holding a baby. For some reason, at that point in my life, I needed that ring. Now, it sits in Gigi's jewelry box full of shiny play baubles.We don't need to show people we're in a committed relationship by some ring, but rather by the way he rests his hand on my back in line at the theater without thinking, or the way we automatically put the armrest up between our airplane seats, or from the respective scars we carry on our bodies from moments of love; like the burn scar on his arm from when I accidentally shut the grill lid on it when a bee came to close to me while we were making kabobs, and the gash on my labia because he's horrible at romantic shaving.When I was younger and saw Andy without his ring, I became insecure. Now, whenever I worry he doesn't love me like he used to, which is especially rare because we just had sex for a year and neither of us are great at faking it, instead of reaching for his ring, he kisses me and says buried together. Which is apparently his morbid form of ""I love you.""But, I take it to mean that should I go first, he'll poison himself so that we can share a giant love coffin with nothing between us but our box of wedding rings and a body pillow because I'm a horrible back sleeper."

The historic and stylish landmark midtown Manhattan hotel was originally opened in 1929 and re-opened after a $46 million renovation. The Lexington is rich in history and was once recognized as the place to be for Hollywood royalty, jazz aficionados, including Arthur Godfrey and Dorothy Lamour. At one time it was also the private residence of Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio after they married and she filmed, The Seven Year Itch. Nearby is where she stood above a subway grate in a white dress and created one of the most iconic images of the 20th century. A night of jazz and champagne-filled elegance christened a new era at the hotel with special performances by the cast of the highly anticipated Broadway musical, After Midnight.The hotel features a new collection of art with pieces by Alba Clemente and Ruben Toledo. Toledo and his wife have created Jazz Age costumes for After Midnight in their first Broadway show collaboration. Isabel Toledo also designed Michelle Obama's historic sparkling lemongrass-yellow Inauguration dress and coat ensemble that the First Lady wore as her husband was sworn into office.Holding a red balloon, Dulé Hill, widely known for his role on The West Wing, performed the legendary Frank Sinatra song ""I've Got the World on a String"" to the crowd of art and fashion influencers. Isabel Toledo also celebrated Mickey Boardman's birthday with vegan cupcakes. It was a swanky party that honored the ""Old New York"" and ushered in a ""New New York"" at this classic hotel.Attendees included: Ruben Toledo, Alba Clemente, Isabel Toledo, Chiara Clemente, Francesco Clemente, Dulé Hill, Mickey Boardman, Paige Powell, René Ricard, David Hershkovits, Kim Hastreiter, Gus Van Sant, Bevy Smith, Stephanie Hirsch, Fern Mallis, Jamee and Peter Gregory, Kipton Cronkite, Sante D'Orazio, Elizabeth Kurpis, Sophie Elgort, Fran Lebowitz, Sylvia Martins-Niarchos, Tanya Selvaratnam, Desmond Richardson, Adriane Lenox, T.
