I looked at universities, training programs and talked to lots of experts in the field.I was so impressed with the people and my findings that I decided to become a professional coach and went back to school.Coaching is an accredited, well-established and respected profession.• It's profoundly useful to people. • It presents diverse, thought-provoking knowledge, skills and results. • The ethical and professional standards are high. • And... it works! Masterful coaching involves helping people ... transform themselves, their communities, and their world. It involves impacting people's visions and values as well as helping them reshape their way of being, thinking, and actions. It involves challenging and supporting people in achieving higher levels of performance while allowing them to bring out the best in themselves and those around them. -- Robert Hargrove -- Masterful Coaching Coaching is related to other modalities like therapy, consulting, and mentoring and incorporates some facets of each.Here are five simple ways to define coaching and why it is immensely valuable. 1. Coaching is not therapyTherapy traditionally is treatment to cure behavioral or emotional problems such as trauma, depression, anxiety, even serious mental illness, so people can live functional, good lives. The word literally means, ""curing, healing.""In therapy, the healing may require fixing problems, dealing with issues in the past, analyzing behavior to resolve a specific problematic feeling or belief... focusing on ""why"" something happened.Like therapy, coaching acknowledges the past, but more importantly, coaching is always about moving the client forward, from where they are presently, to where they want to be in the future. Contrary to therapy, coaches see opportunities to be developed, not problems to be fixed. It's an active, invigorating process assisting you to reach your potential, challenging and supporting you, seeing what is working well for you and promoting that success so you can achieve miraculous and logical results. With a trained coach, you get personal assistance from someone who has your best interest in mind. Someone creative, non-judgmental, a good listener whose purpose is to help you manage and enjoy your life. Coaching ... brings out the potential in a client, be it a person, couple, family or corporation. This process is done by emotionally connecting the client's inner purpose and passion to outer goals and strategies to bring about extraordinary and sustainable results. --  Bruce D. Schneider -- Institute for Professional Excellence in Coaching (iPEC)2. Coaching is not consultingA consultant is hired to identify a problem and comes up with a plan to solve that specific problem. When they do, they turn the plan for success over to you -- ""Here you go. This should work. Job complete.""Coaches work with you every step of the way, creating and implementing a plan together. That's the partnership. How galvanizing is it for you to work on an idea you helped create rather than being told what to do? Trained coaches enable you to find answers and then take action. We're experts on the coaching process -- asking questions, utilizing tools, principles and methods to help you produce exactly what you want.Clearing for change is what I call it. Just as you would clear a runway for a plane to take off, or clear land to build something, coaching helps you make sure nothing is blocking your progress and aspirations.Coaching is a healthy, positive, and enabling process that develops the capacity of people to solve today's business problems. Touching people's spirits and rekindling what deeply matters to them. -- Thomas G. Crane -- The Heart of coaching3. Coaching is not mentoringMentors have a certain experience and ask you to follow their know-how and success. They teach you what they lived through. They've been in your shoes.What works for me as a person and coach may be different for you. Coaches never impose their beliefs on you.You'll learn to know yourself -- discovering what works for you; applying it to your full benefit. Coaching creates a context where people regularly work on the most important issues of their lives. Coaching functions on a process level to help people understand who and where they are in their lives. -- Co-Active coaching by Laura Whitmore, Henry Kimsey-House and Phil Sandahl4. Coaching is not advicePeople love to give advice, but they're not a trained professional coach, and the ""here's what you do"" approach doesn't get to the heart of change. It's their answer for you. Your personal coach listens deeply without judging you or giving advice. All the answers are in you. Coaches help people set better goals and then reach those goals ... ask their clients to do more than they would have done on their own ... help their clients to focus better so as to produce results more quickly ... provide clients with tools, support, and structure to accomplish more. -- Thomas Leonard -- Founder, Coach University and the ICF5. Coaching is not professional sports coaching It's not about ego, the ""I"" win competition mindset of beating out someone else, but rather to have everyone win, all the way around and always to do your best. You'll gain fortitude through coaching. The more you know yourself and your purpose in life, the more stable, resilient and confident you'll be.Coaches anchor people to their own internal strengths; they inspire organizations to dream beyond their plans. They apply emotional and intellectual intelligence to the long haul of life and work. Coaches facilitate the change that clients need as they prepare to face the future with strength and optimism. -- Frederic Hudson -- Founder: The Hudson InstituteNow tell me: How weird does all this sound to you?"

He's indoors--at what will soon be the home of an art installation featuring some of his avant-garde fashion designs--but he longs to be outside in the park across the street. It's by traversing the city's public spaces in his sartorial splendor (most notably throughout Harlem) that Headley has become a local legend. He's been content with existing on the periphery for years but the release of a new book, Where's Wendell? and collaborative installation New York, Naturally may be the beginning of bringing his name to a national stage.  Wendell Headley and park visitors/Credit: Felicia M. Gordon  Details on Headley's background are scarce and in an interview he was not forthcoming about the past. The only information provided is that he grew up in and around New York, was a painter in the 1980s mentioned in art periodicals with the likes of Keith Haring and started sewing to overcome substance abuse issues. The result of the latter has been the creation of colorful flamboyant designs where he repurposes materials, sometimes tearing apart and reworking one completed design into something entirely new. It gives the garments an ephemeral quality that is not exactly in line with the fashion world's business model. But Headley could care less. He creates not to sell but to promote a spirit of creativity and childhood innocence, even if he knows many may never understand. Where's Wendell?/Credit: Felicia M. Gordon  ""I am the working class heroes hero,"" he said. ""I am saving middleclass and rich people from their own self-destruction. What makes my clothes a fantasy is nobody could wear them anywhere 'cause they are outside of people's causal imagination. My clothes are about childhood playtime and people grow out of that style altogether.""  Where's Wendell? documents Headley's style and outlook on life through photographs taken by Felicia M. Gordon, founder of the art collective Sugar Hill Culture Club (SHCC). The limited edition book will be released July 2 with a private celebration as part of the exhibition ""If You Build It"" presented by No Longer Empty in partnership with Broadway Housing Communities. [Full disclosure: writer is creative director of the project's programming]. In addition Headley plans to lead interactive art and fashion workshops as part of  ""New York Naturally"", which also features additional work by Gordon and Imani Razat.   New streaming service for African content  It's being dubbed the ""Hulu"" of Africa to United States viewers but the new platform, Africa Magic GO, has a little more on its agenda than just offering access to the latest in African films and television series. The site, which allows U.S. viewers to stream original content from the continent online for only $8 a month, also hopes to foster a greater cross-cultural exchange.   Tinsel/Courtesy: Africa Magic GO  ""Africa is a diverse continent and people living in the U.S. will now have access to stories told from an African perspective. This is an opportunity for Americans in general to see that our cultures enjoy great overlaps,"" said Wangi Mba-Uzoukwu, regional director at Africa Magic.  53 Extra/Courtesy: Africa Magic GOHighlights include Nigeria's popular soap opera, Tinsel that focuses on the scandal and romance of the film production world. 53 Extra is a weekly West African entertainment magazine show. And Blue Flames, is the tale of three families vying for wealth and fulfillment.  Mba-Uzoukwu believes that content focused on themes with universal appeal will demonstrate that Africa Magic GO's programming is not just for a ""niche"" market.  ""African content tells life stories and the underlying themes of love, deception, betrayal, jealousy and so on resonate with people from all walks of life. There is growing interest in stories from Africa told from the African perspective.""  Danny Simmons has the best of both worlds in new poetry book  The relationship between poetry and visual art may not be immediate for some but for Danny Simmons the two are inextricably linked thanks to his childhood.  ""My father was an amazing influence with his poetry. Everyday he'd recite poetry around the house and ask us what we felt about it. And my mother would be painting,"" Simmons recalled. ""For neither of them was that their job but these were their passions. It steeped in and was something I picked up and I am now a painter and writer."" Courtesy KMW Studio Publishing  He's taken that inspiration and applied it to is new book, The Brown Beatnik Tomes which features his poems juxtaposed with his neo-African Abstract Expressionist paintings. The effect is a conversation between two artistic disciplines that broadens the scope and impact of each.  In looking back on his career, Simmons admitted to placing his poetry career on-hold for several years. While helping spoken word poetry reach a new mainstream audience through his work in co-creating the hit television series Def Poetry Jam he decided it'd be a conflict of interest to simultaneously pursue a career as a poet. But now he is catching up on that time that has gone by. And for him there is no better time than the present to be a poet.  ""People are seeking something more cerebral. As rap music gets more ratchet people look for meaning in the words they listen to,"" he said. ""The world has become a little more intense and people need ways to vent and talk about what is going on.""   ****  The weekly column, On the ""A"" w/Souleo, covers the intersection of the arts, culture entertainment and philanthropy in Harlem and beyond and is written by Souleo, founder and president of event/media content production company, Souleo Enterprises, LLC."

Watch the premiere on June 27th. Louriza's Twitter: @LourizaTronco. Photo by Westley Olson.Louriza Tronco sure knows how to enjoy life! She embraces everything with a smile, high energy and positive outlook.Some quick tidbits about Louriza before we delve into the interview: She almost applied to massage therapy school before getting into performing arts school. When she was a kid, she wanted to be Baby Spice from The Spice Girls. She always sleeps on one side of the bed, never the middle!You play the ""not too bright"" Yuki in the upcoming Disney Channel original movie Zapped. Tell us about your audition.I got the audition with the help of my amazing manager, Deb. I was originally up for the part of Taylor Dean and was living in Victoria, BC at the time so I self-taped. I didn't really think anything of it -- I didn't even know it was Disney at that stage! I was away on vacation when I had an inbox full of messages from my manager saying they wanted to bring me in for a callback. The next day I hopped on a boat and then a plane to Vancouver. I read for the director, Peter DeLuise, that day. A couple of days went by and I got another call saying that they wanted to see me for another role, Yuki. I went in for a second callback. They wanted to make sure I could dance so they asked me to do a couple of turns on the spot -- so I literally kicked off my heels and danced a hip-hop solo that I happened to remember from when I used to compete in dance. They were playing the Janet Jackson song off my iPhone and I was dancing on the carpet in a small room -- it was so fun! Do you think when you're 30 years old you'll remember all the lines from Princess Diaries 1 & 2?I will definitely still remember all the lines then! I think I loved watching the story of a young lady finding out that she was born a princess. I mean, what little girl wouldn't love to be in her shoes?! What's your family background? Who named you? Are you named after anyone?Both my parents are Filipino -- they moved from the Philippines to Winnipeg, Manitoba in their mid-twenties and that's where I grew up. My parents named me using my Lolas' (Grandmas in Filipino). My mom's mom is Lourdes and my dad's mom is Rizalina. They took half from each name and got Louriza! Both of my Lolas are super hard working, so I'm definitely proud to be named after them. Give us a behind the scenes story from Zapped.Our director, Peter DeLuise has this theory of never asking his actors to do something he can't do. Since Zapped has a lot of comedic parts, there is definitely a lot of physicality involved. He asked the jock guys to do something called ""locker swimming"" which is basically using your own arm strength to push your body from locker to wall while laying down... and before they shot the scene he did it! He also wanted to give me more sass as Yuki, so he would pose his body in a ""S"" shape using his hands on his hips and asked me to copy. What was it like growing up with two older brothers?I was always into Barbies and playing dress up as a kid and they wanted to play Nintendo and action figures, so it got lonely sometimes. I always got my own room, because they didn't really like my ruffled curtains or pink sheets. RJ is almost two years older and Emmanuel is four years older than me. They were super helpful with my pre-cal and chemistry homework which is awesome. Not so great with asking them to come watch my three hour dance recitals; we would have to drag them to sit in the audience. I guess that's payback for them not letting my Barbies have a play-date with their Power Rangers. You play Andrea in the upcoming star-studded film ""Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb."" Describe your character.Andrea is known to be the cool, popular senior at Nick Daley's high school who is played by Skyler Gisondo. He is absolutely fantastic -- great energy on set and just a cool guy all around. What beauty and hair products do you use?I use a lot of Sephora and Mac products. When I see a hairstylist I usually ask what their opinion is on what hair curler or hair crème to use -- it changes consistently. As long as I feel good wearing it and I have no allergic reactions it's all good. What's the most valuable acting lesson you've learned so far?I've had a lot of fantastic coaches and teachers who continue to support and push me as an actor. One of them is Andrew Mcilroy who I take classes with consistently. I always believe training is very important. It keeps me sharp and on my game especially in a competitive field. Andrew has always reminded me to put story before anything else. The story of a script is the most important; when in doubt while building a character he always asks, what helps the story? Go back to the story! Thank you Andrew.What's your dream house look like?No clue. I haven't really thought of that. I just know I want a couple of dogs running around.If you had to shave your head for a part, would you do it or have to think about it? If shaving my head helps tell the story of the character I'm playing then absolutely yes! I love having long hair but, it'll grow back so it's all good!What's it like being at a press photo shoot?Oh, it's so fun. If I could, I'd do it more often! It's all based on personal preference on how you'd like to prep for it and how you'd like to present yourself. I love being hands on and love getting involved as much as possible with whatever project I'm doing. I love blasting music during shoots. It definitely brings out energy with you and it takes the pressure off of trying to make things ""perfect"". It also makes me dance in between takes so that's sweet. What's your favorite dog breed?Oh my goodness. My favorite breed changes like every week! It's kind of ridiculous. Growing up I loved Shih tzus. Then I saw one with really long hair and a bow and I wasn't really into that. Then I started to print out pictures of golden retrievers but I know they shed a lot and they're also almost bigger than me, so that's a thing. Recently, I've been getting really excited every time I see a French Bulldog walking down the street so that's this week's fave. Anything else you'd like to say?I'm so excited for this movie, Zapped, to come out! The cast and crew have all worked so hard and I hope that everyone who catches it will have as much fun watching it as we had making it."
5,POLITICS,Where Was God When Israel Deported African Refugees?,"David Sheen, ContributorIndependent journalist and filmmaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/where-was-god-during-isra_b_5500889.html,"While the government works to sweep asylum-seekers off its streets and decant them back into the interior of the African continent, the vast majority of Jewish religious institutions and lay leaders in Israel have not made any attempt to aid the Africans.",2014-06-19,"African asylum seekers, who entered Israel illegally via Egypt, lean at the fence of the Holot detention centre in Israel's southern Negev Desert, on February 17, 2014 as they join other migrants who came to protest outside the detention facility. The Israeli government has opened last year the sprawling Holot detention facility to house both new entrants and immigrants already in the country deemed to have disturbed public order. Tens of thousands of migrants, mostly Eritrean and Sudanese, have been staging mass demonstrations in the country against moves by the Israeli authorities to track them down and deport them, or throw them into detention facilities without trial. AFP PHOTO/JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cd4c2100004502c961fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How should religious institutions respond when the regimes that rule the territories they inhabit incite racism and carry out ethnic cleanings?Seventy-five years after Pius XII became pontiff on the eve of World War Two, his successor Francis is still wrestling with this question. In an interview last week with La Vanguardia following a visit to Israel, the reigning pope admitted that Pius made mistakes, but defended his record, as well. Although the wartime pope didn't speak out against anti-Semitic crimes committed by the fascists, he did hide dozens of Jewish babies from them, Francis insisted, and holding his tongue may have saved the lives of those infants. Was that enough?In Israel itself, the question of how institutions of faith should respond to a state-sponsored drive for racial-religious purity is also of great relevance today.While it is Palestinian Christians and Muslims who have traditionally borne the brunt of efforts to Judaize, or de-Gentile-ize the country, another ethnic out-group has competed with them in recent years for the wrath of Israeli ultra-nationalists: African asylum-seekers. After 60,000 sub-Saharan Africans, Christian and Muslim, sought refuge in Israel from political persecution and ethnic cleansing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a multi-pronged campaign to expel them all.After building a fence on Israel's border with the African continent to prevent any further entry by asylum-seekers, the government began rounding up those already living in Israel and sticking them in containment centers, to be detained there indefinitely. The stated intention of these spartan camps is to sap the Africans of any hope of achieving freedom in Israel, so that they will give up and grudgingly agree to go back to the horrors they fled from. Netanyahu's justification for their draconian treatment: the Africans' non-Jewishness ""threatens the social fabric... and our national identity.""While the government works to sweep asylum-seekers off its streets and decant them back into the interior of the African continent, the vast majority of Jewish religious institutions and lay leaders in Israel have not made any attempt to aid the Africans. Rather, many have drummed up support for the government's actions, and more have riled up their constituents to demand even more extreme action against them. Hundreds of rabbis on the state payroll signed edicts forbidding Jews from renting apartments to the asylum-seekers, and some even issued verdicts of ""rodef"", or death sentences, on those Jews who dare to do so.In other Western countries, the main complaint lobbed at immigrants by the reactionary right-wing is that they cling too much to their traditional customs and resist assimilation. In Israel, tellingly, it is exactly the opposite: the chief grievance of those who want all the Africans gone is that they do assimilate. Signs of successful absorption -- learning the language, intermingling with the local population -- trigger panic among many Jewish Israelis, and among religious Jews, even more so.Even when they want to convert to Judaism, every single African applicant is outright rejected. Just last week the cleric responsible for all conversions explained Israel's policy thus: ""The government built a fence... on the state's border, and we built one here, at the entrance gate to the Jewish people.""Surrounded by near-unanimous demands for the de-Africanization of Israel, Bracha Shapiro stands out as one of the few religious voices of dissent. Raised in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, she continues to live her life based on halacha, Talmudic law. Yet unlike the vast majority of her co-religionists, she believes that non-Jewish Africans should be treated with compassion and allowed to stay in Israel and make a living legally. Shapiro served the asylum-seeker community as the first social worker hired by the refugee aid organization Assaf.In a 3-part interview that is equal parts heart-breaking and hope-inspiring, Shapiro told me how she, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish woman, came to work with African refugees in Israel, and how news of her work with the asylum-seekers has been received by her religious peers."

As the commentators were talking about Bubba, they said he came in 50th place last year having won it the year before in 2012. A 2013 sports page headline read, ""Bubba Watson takes 10 on Number 12 after hitting 3 balls into Ree's Creek."" It seems that for Bubba, success was never final. Perhaps his victory in 2012 made him pretty sure he would do well in '13 -- but that was not to be. However, he didn't give up or let up, but came charging back to win the Masters for the second time this year. He learned ""the hard way"" that success is never final. Maybe the second Masters victory was even sweeter than the first. So no matter how satisfied we may be with our success, we must keep moving ahead. And like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill, we should never rest on our laurels, but continue to race to the top, realizing it is a race that we can never stop running.I'm Bill Marriott and thanks for helping me keep Marriott on the move.This post first appeared on MarriottOnTheMove.com."

I had two months off and was getting paid for it. I had made so many plans for this day. Of course I was going to eat healthy, exercise and read, but the highlight was... I was going to watch so much TV!!!! I usually don't get to do that while I'm working, as I'm so busy with my corrections and all the other things that teachers do. With two boys and one girl, we are either watching sports or Mythbusters during the school year.So today was the day I would watch uninterrupted television for hours. I warned my kids and told them that the TV belonged to me for the next couple of hours, so they should find something else to do. Of course they went back to their cell phones and iPods. I made myself a hot cup of coffee with my special french vanilla creamer and I sat on the couch with the remote in my hand. I was so excited!As I turned on the TV, the first thing that came on was Adam Levine talking about his acne issues. I tried to figure out what that was about, then realized it was an infomercial for Proactive. I really didn't feel like watching close up pictures of zits so I changed the channel. The next channel had this little girl who had an interesting family, to say the least. The show was called, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. It was absolutely ridiculous. The girl was very cute, but the show was just horrific.So I changed the channel again and came across a show called Naked and Afraid! People were walking around and trying to survive while they are butt naked, do I need to say more? So I really want to ask the producers of the show, does the camera man have food and clothes while the people in front of the camera are sick, naked and hungry??I was disappointed by this time, so I got up to get some chocolate ice cream with chocolate syrup. I then decided to turn the TV on again, and guess what was on? Keeping Up With the Kardashians. I actually sat there with my mouth open while I watched it for a few minutes. Many questions came in my mind while watching that show. Do people today really talk like that? Do normal people wake up looking like those girls? Why are these girls so famous? They are gorgeous women don't get me wrong, but they seem so unreal. Obviously underneath all that makeup and gifts from plastic surgeons, they are really smart girls and know what sells. I was sure that OWN network would have something meaningful on, and I saw that Iyanla was on. I love her, so I decided to watch Iyanla - Fix My Life. It was actually disturbing to watch couples being humiliated by one another and Iyanla in order to solve their problems. After watching for a few minutes, I started to think, What is wrong with us as a society? Why are most of our ""Reality Shows"" showing people that are willing to make a fool of themselves? Do we watch them because we are fascinated by their fearlessness when it comes to letting it all hang out, or is it because we can laugh and make fun of them? I am not sitting here and being judgmental about anyone. I'm just giving my opinion. When I asked around, my friends confessed that they mostly watched reality shows. With shows like Duck Dynasty, Life With Latoya, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Return to Amish, My Five Wives, etc. what are we saying to the next generation? Are we telling them to laugh and ridicule other people because they choose to live differently than us?What is our fascination with realty television? Why can't we watch documentaries or shows that teach us something like America with Lisa Ling, instead of finding satisfaction in seeing other people's dysfunctional lives? I feel like it's not even reality TV; these people seem so well-rehearsed, they know what they will be saying and wearing. These on-screen reality stars obviously understand that they can make money not by working hard or gaining an education, but by becoming an unreal reality star. The formula to a good reality show is real life people trying to act like themselves, and the sillier they look the better. After thinking for a while I decided to stick with what I knew -- I watched reruns of I Love Lucy!!!"
