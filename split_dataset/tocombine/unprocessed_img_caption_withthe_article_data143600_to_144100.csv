All of this interconnectedness has created a meanness in us, or maybe it has simply revealed a mean spirit that was there all along, but I wish it would go away. Even kind, loving people I know are susceptible to it, and my hope is that this post will get folks to reconsider before hitting return.I'm talking about the Mean Photo. You know, the snapshot of someone grocery shopping, or going to the prom, or on the subway who probably thinks she looks perfectly okay, but some stranger (or worse, a friend) takes a picture and posts it on the Internet for the rest of us to share and ""like"" and write snide, superior comments.If I see one more picture with the caption, ""Oh. Dear. God!"" I may just lose it.That is a human being in that picture. A person who got up that day, got dressed and left the house without ever thinking it would make her the subject of public ridicule, simply because her shorts are too tight. Maybe she's gained a lot of weight recently due to a medical condition and can't afford new clothes, or doesn't want to buy things in a size she intends to reduce. Maybe it's a single mom who had to choose between doing the laundry and going to her son's baseball game, so here she is, cheering him on, making the better choice, even though this outfit is all she had to put on.Did you come up with the cleverest caption for the balding guy with glasses waiting for the bus? Congratulations! Yes, I'm sure he chose to lose his hair, be nearsighted and not own a car. You are so much bigger and better than he is, so by all means, make as nasty a comment as you can think of. He won't mind, since his life is already so perfect.I've posted this kind of thing before and almost always, someone chimes in that the people on the mean picture sites are asking for it, since they went to Walmart dressed that way to get attention. Someone else once said to me, ""Anytime you're in public, you're fair game."" Are you kidding me? You are not fair game to be ridiculed on a national level simply because you left your house in an outfit others would find weird or inappropriate. I've seen a lot of these pictures (sadly, because they are constantly being posted online and forwarded), and most of those people did not leave the house to get attention. They left the house to get milk. And they have the right to do that without being called a ""plain ol' white trash nasty HEFFA"" (yes, an actual comment at one such mockery site).I know that writing this will subject me to all kinds of ""lighten up"" responses, and I don't care. I'm putting it out there, so I'm willing to weather whatever ridicule it generates. That's my choice.But to degrade, insult, mock, malign, humiliate and probably hurt someone because their appearance amuses you is not funny. It's cruel. You're better than that.Truly happy people treat everyone with respect. Show the world how happy you are. Delete the mean photo and go give a total stranger a nice compliment.

3,PARENTING,From the Runway to Preschool,"Shannon Sutherland, Contributor
mother, blogger, comedy club owner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/from-the-runway-to-preschool_us_5b9d7fe2e4b03a1dcc88cc8c,I walked the runway with a kind of joy and excitement in my heart I have never felt before.  I spotted my daughter in the audience clapping for me.,2013-09-11,2013-09-10-602875_511693295584975_1493535160_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-10-602875_511693295584975_1493535160_n-thumb.jpg,"Most of the parenting choices my husband and I make are discussed, considered and obsessed about for much longer than either of us would like to admit. If we feed her that ""bad"" food, will it hurt her chances of getting into a good college? If we let her cry it out, will she spend the rest of her life in therapy? Will she never grow up to be an independent woman because we let her play with princess toys?So, when I was asked to walk the runway at Strut: The Fashionable Mom Show, as a Whirlpool Ambassador, you would have thought that I would have contemplated the decision for years. But I didn't. I said yes in a matter of seconds.I love clothes and in my early twenties pretended to be a college student majoring in fashion just so I could attend fashion week. As I organized the chairs and got the makeup tables ready, I always dreamed about how fabulous it would be to get invited to a fashion show, but never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would walk in a fashion show. So, when I was asked, I said yes without thinking. When I arrived at Mercedes Benz Fashion week for hair and makeup, I was asked if how I felt about hair extensions. I said they sounded like fun. I joked around with the hairstylist while he turned my short bob into a mane that even Barbie herself would be jealous of. Next, it was time for makeup. I was given smoky eyes with tons of eye shadow. I barely recognized myself and for a second, thought about the message all this primping was going to send to my 2-year-old daughter, but then I became distracted by how nice it felt to be the center of attention and oh, did I mention I got to put fake eyelashes on, too?I wore a bright red dress, coat, purse and leopard shoes. I loved the ensemble, but would never wear it in my day-to-day life. I mean, I could barely even walk in the shoes. I peeked into the audience to look for my daughter and all the sudden I heard her scream, ""Mommy!"" The look on her face was one of excitement and pride. I waved to her and took my place in the line. For the first time, I became nervous. What if I fell? What if I fainted? What if the sight of me in extensions, fake eyelashes and high heels made my daughter insecure about her looks for the rest of her life?By walking in a runway show, was I destroying the strong girl my husband and I had worked so hard to create?But then the hairstylist made last minute touch-ups to my hair, I was told I was gorgeous, given the OK to walk, and the second I hit the runway, none of those previous thoughts mattered because I was having too much fun to care.I walked the runway with a kind of joy and excitement in my heart I have never felt before. I spotted my daughter in the audience clapping for me. During the finale, I spotted her again and she was dancing in her grandparents' laps while holding her daddy's hand and that's when it hit me; all of the well thought out parenting choices won't make a difference if we aren't having fun. Yes, we need to give our kids healthy foods. Yes, we need to think about the toys we buy for them and what they are exposed to on TV. Yes, we need to carefully consider how we discipline them. But we also need to show our kids that life should be enjoyed and what better way to do that than by having fun in front of our kids?It's been a day since I walked the runway at fashion week and as I write this, my mind keeps wavering back and forth between different parenting decisions. Tomorrow is my daughter's first day of preschool and I am worried about how she will do with separating. If she does well is that because we never formed a close bond? If she cries when I leave, is it because I raised her to be insecure and unsure of herself?  Then my mind wanders back to how I felt when I walked the runway and my daughter's face lit up when she saw me having the time of my life and I decide that since I have no idea how she will react to her first day of school, there's no point in obsessing about it. It's out of my control. But I can get her excited about school. So, I help her with her brand new backpack, we hold hands and walk out the door like we are back at fashion week, because while I may have no idea what the day may bring, I can control how I react to it, so we may as well have fun!"

MAC Cosmetics lead makeup artist Lucia Pica gave the models ""futuristic skin"" by mixing Strobe Cream (a hydrating luminator) with creamy foundations to match their skin. Then Luna Cream Colour Base (a frosty white shimmer) was applied to light-reflecting spots on the face (i.e. down the bridge of the nose and cupid's bow). Pica intensified the effect by brushing on Dual Jewel Pressed Pigment (a brick red hue), starting from the crease of the eye and working down to the cheekbones. Brushed-up brows and clear mascara were the finishing makeup touches.Playing off this iridescent glow, Priti NYC manicurists used three different metallic nail polishes on the fingers and toes: Pewter Veil (a grayish-blue), Chrysanthos (a shimmery gold) and Old Man Cactus (a silver with a chrome finish).

8,FOOD & DRINK,Weird Produce: Why We Hate To Confuse Grocery Store Cashiers,Rebecca Orchant,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weird-produce-grocery-check-out_us_5b9d7fa7e4b03a1dcc88c928,"That thing where you buy the vegetable that earns a ""WTF?"" at check-out time.",2013-09-10,A woman puts groceries into a reusable grocery bag in the bagging area of the checkout line. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d7fa726000036007fe615.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Food nerds: this is a cry for help. There is an entire segment of people in my life who I respect, appreciate and spend a lot of time with, who I appear to be alienating left and right. I make them frustrated, confused and I'm never sure when I should help them and when I should leave them to their own devices. I am talking about grocery store cashiers. I developed a freakishly early affinity for the grocery store. I liked looking at all the food, especially in the produce section. I liked the smells, the changes in temperature and knowing that we were gathering snacks. We were a pretty weird produce-heavy family, and always seemed to grab something that would raise an eyebrow upon checkout. Sometimes it was artichokes (this was a suburb of Albuquerque in the late 1980s, so), sometimes it was my fault, requesting that my treat from the grocery store be a starfruit, rather than a cookie or cupcake. The routine was pretty much the same every time. The cashier would pick up the offending fruit or vegetable, consider it, look for a sticker and finally look to one of my parents with an air of slight exasperation. My mom or dad would make a joke about importing it from an alien planet, I would giggle, it would get rung up and we'd go about our day. Pretty inconsequential in the grand scheme of human relations. But then it kept happening. Everywhere. Nearly every time. In every city. And now, I'm just looking for a little commiseration -- is it happening to all of us? A few months ago, I was in a Whole Foods in New York City (a pretty far cry from the Safeway in 1980s New Mexico). I unloaded my basket onto the conveyor belt and the familiar beep-beep-beep began. I was digging for my wallet when it stopped. ""What is this,"" the cashier asked me, ""parsley or cilantro?"" It was parsley, the beeps continued. Then stopped again.""What is this?"" It was a parsnip. Beep. Beep. Then, the final straw. Wordlessly, he held up a huge, knobby horseradish root. The look on his face was somewhere between revulsion and sleep. ""It's a horseradish root,"" I said. He sighed a big sigh, and put it into the basket, without ringing it up, so eager to end our transaction that he'd just given me the thing free of charge. I giggled nervously, ""Sorry that I bought all the weirdest produce in your store.""""Total is $18.99.""I want to be 100 percent clear about this straight away: I felt really bad. There are hundreds of produce SKUs in a store of that size, no one should be expected to memorize them all. And I have served time in customer service, and I know how it can feel to be at the end of a long shift full of people who need you to do things for them. But also, you work in Whole Foods, man. In New York City. This happens to me a lot. Not usually with the gravity of that Whole Food's cashier's exasperation, but probably once every trip to the grocery store. Does it happen to you guys? Does it bother you? I've been trying to pin-point exactly what it is about this experience that really gets to me, and I think I may have hit it, finally. I try really, really hard to be nice to people when they're working, no matter what job they're doing. I pay a lot of attention to being spatially aware in crowded places, especially grocery stores. I try to stay out of the way. I try to put things on the conveyor belt in an arrangement that makes it easy to pack into bags. This is just a part of who I am and how I grew up. So, when someone doesn't know something about their job, like whether that's cilantro or parsley, I never want to act like a know-it-all or a jerk. I never want to assume that they don't know. But then, because I'm also who I am and the difference between cilantro and parsley is just very, very close to being the only thing I care about deeply on this earth, I also want to explain how you can tell which is which by smell, or by the width of the stems, or the shape of the leaves. A thing, I am quite sure, no grocery cashier on the tail end of an eight-hour day really gives a shit about, quite frankly. All of this takes place in my head until someone says, ""Total is $18.99."" I pay, say ""Thank you very much, have a great day/night,"" and go on my way. Here's the thing: I'm never going to stop buying the weirdest thing in the produce section. And it will never stop being annoying for a customer to hand you something that proves there are things you don't know about your job. So I suppose, what I'm wondering, is if any other carambola-eating, artichoke-steaming, watercress-garnishing food nerds out there have found a social salve to this particular irritation. Or should I just move on with my life and go grate my horseradish?Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "
9,WELLNESS,How Climate Change May Affect West Nile Spread,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-west-nile-spread-mosquitoes_us_5b9d7face4b03a1dcc88c96a,"Researchers found that mosquito populations are likely to vary depending on the part of the U.S. For instance, assuming the",2013-09-10,"A mosquito is sorted according to species and gender before testing at the Dallas County mosquito lab in Dallas, Friday, May 11, 2007. With the arrival of spring rainstorms and steamy weather, mosquito-control workers in Texas and across the nation are gearing up for another round in their battle against West Nile Virus. The mosquito-borne virus, which killed 177 people in the United States last year, has prompted health departments to revamp the way they fight mosquitoes and monitor viruses. Last year, Dallas confirmed 59 human cases of neuroinvasive West Nile, the form of the disease that can cause meningitis or encephalitis. (AP Photo/LM Otero)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d7fac26000036007fe619.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Climate change may have effects on the spread of West Nile virus by mosquitoes, but they're not likely to be the same throughout the United States, according to a new study from University of Arizona researchers. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined the effects of current climate condition predictions on mosquito populations throughout the United States. Researchers found that the effects on mosquito populations are likely to vary depending on the region of country, with mosquito populations actually dropping in the South, but not in the northern part of the U.S.""One assumption was that with rising temperatures, mosquitoes would thrive across the board,"" study researcher Cory Morin, who conducted the study as part of his doctoral dissertation at the university, said in a statement. ""Our study shows this is unlikely. Rather, the effects of climate change are different depending on the region and because of that, the response of West Nile virus transmitting mosquito populations will be different as well.""The Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito species, which is known to transmit West Nile virus, was examined for the study; it lays eggs in standing water. However, researchers noted that there are other mosquito species that were not examined in the study that also spread West Nile. In addition, birds can spread West Nile virus, though they were not examined in the study. Researchers found that mosquito populations are likely to vary depending on the part of the U.S. For instance, assuming the southwestern part of the country can expect hotter and drier summers from climate change, the mosquito season will likely be later because of rain in the late summer and fall. However, this could also lead to a longer mosquito season.In the south and central parts of the United States, on the other hand, climate models show there is likely to be less rain during the summer and early fall seasons. This means there will likely be fewer mosquito days. The northern parts of the United States will likely still have enough rain and not as extreme of temperatures to decrease summer mosquito breeding. ""'Which locations are likely to experience epidemics in the future?'-- those are the kinds of questions studies like ours may help prepare for,"" Morin said in the statement. ""We don't model the actual virus, we only look at the vector, but our study informs at least one part of the ecology of the virus. It is unique in projecting the impacts of climate change on a West Nile vector.""Last year, the number of people who died in the U.S. from West Nile virus hit record levels, at 286. Nearly a third of serious cases and deaths were in Texas alone, the Associated Press reported. While most people infected with West Nile won't experience symptoms, the approximately 20 percent of people who do can expect have symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, head and body aches and rash. Rarely, the virus can cause encephalitis or meningitis, which can lead to more serious symptoms and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This isn't the first time climate change has been linked to disease spread. A recent study in the journal Science examined the numerous ways warmer weather is having an impact on ecosystems by affecting biodiversity loss -- and what that could mean for disease spread. ""Biodiversity loss is a well-established consequence of climate change,"" study researcher Richard Ostfeld, of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, said in a statement. ""In a number of infectious disease systems, such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus, biodiversity loss is tied to greater pathogen transmission and increased human risk. Moving forward, we need models that are sensitive to both direct and indirect effects of climate change on infectious disease.""For a more in-depth look at how climate change might have affected last year's West Nile outbreak, click over to Scientific American's piece here.

""Overall, it is the quality of the calorie that counts rather than the calorie itself when it comes to fighting off disease and maintaining health."" And it could help you drop a few pounds, too. ""While it hasn't been studied, the theory is that if your body doesn't get the nutrients it needs, it holds onto to whatever it gets, making it harder to lose weight."" Plus, if the extra calories are from fat, protein, or fiber, they'll keep you satisfied -- and away from the candy bowl.Whether your goal is better health or slimmer thighs, make the following food swaps for more nutritious, satisfying snacks and meals.Low-Calorie Trap: Crackers  Better Bet: Nuts When you compare 120 calories for six whole-grain crackers to 185 calories for an ounce of unsalted walnuts (that's 14 halves), the first option seems best. But think again: ""The nuts provide omega-3 fatty acids, which help turn off hunger messages in the brain, while the carbs in the crackers may do the opposite,"" Albert says. And while both have about the same amount of protein and fiber, the walnuts have zero sodium -- something we all need to cut back on anyway, for our health and to banish bloating.Low-Calorie Trap: Chicken Breast  Better Bet: Chicken Thigh Come to the dark side! For a measly 34 additional calories, 3 ounces of dark meat will give you more anemia-preventing iron and immunity-boosting zinc than 3 ounces of chicken breast. And don't worry about the saturated fat -- there's only one more gram in dark meat than white, and that's a good thing, Albert says: A little sat fat can be more satisfying and prevent hunger later.Low-Calorie Trap: Low-Fat Frozen Yogurt  Better Bet: Coconut Milk Ice Cream Fro-yo isn't as virtuous as many dieters think: ""Most frozen yogurts' high-sugar, lower-fat content leaves you feeling unsatisfied,"" says Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD, SHAPE contributing editor and author of S.A.S.S! Yourself Slim: Conquer Cravings, Drop Pounds and Lose Inches. ""You may end up polishing off the entire pint -- nearly 700 calories!"" Instead of diving into a tub of potentially chemical-laden frozen yogurt, Sass recommends satisfying your sweet craving with coconut milk ice cream. The saturated fat is healthy medium chain triglycerides, which will fill you up with a half-cup serving (about 250 calories) so you don't go back for more, Sass says. The benefits don't stop there, though. ""Research shows that these fats boost ‘good’ HDL cholesterol, lower ‘bad’ LDL, and help reduce waist circumference,"" she adds. ""And coconut provides antioxidants similar to those in berries, grapes, and dark chocolate.""Low-Calorie Trap: Low-Fat Sour Cream  Better Bet: Guacamole Topping your fajita with reduced-fat sour cream may seem like the better choice, but in reality, it offers little nutrition other than about 12 percent of your daily recommended calcium, Sass says. ""For an extra 40 calories and 6 grams of fat per quarter-cup, guacamole comes with the bonus of antioxidants, 4 grams of fiber, and 340 milligrams of potassium, a mineral that helps control blood pressure by sweeping excess sodium and fluid out of the body."" And you'll get more antioxidants from your meal's veggies: In an Ohio State study, men and women who ate salads with avocado in them absorbed more than eight times more alpha-carotene and 13 times more beta-carotene, both of which help fight cancer and heart disease.Low-Calorie Trap: Puffed Veggie Snacks  Photo from Amazon.com Better Bet: Popcorn Don't be fooled by the name -- those vegetable versions of cheese puffs are made with very little produce and have up to twice the sodium of potato chips for only about 30 fewer calories. Air-popped popcorn gives you the same crunchy goodness and loads more. Three cups counts as a serving of whole grains and packs more antioxidants than a serving of fruit or vegetables, a recent University of Scranton study reported. ""That's because the antioxidants are more concentrated in popcorn due to its lower water content compared to fluid-rich produce,"" Sass explains. And while three cups of plain air-popped popcorn has only 93 calories compared to veggie snacks' 140, who really wants a flavorless snack? Add some oil and herbs, and both your body and your taste buds will enjoy the 160 to 220 calories.Low-Calorie Trap: Jam  Better Bet: Nut Butter Something made of rapidly-absorbed starch and sugar and little protein, which will spike your blood sugar and leave you feeling hungry and fatigued, doesn't sound like a healthy choice, right? So put down the jam or jelly and spread some nut butter on your toast, pancakes, or waffles instead, says Lauren Harris-Pincus, R.D. cofounder of NutritionBabes.com. ""Even though nut butter can contain nearly twice the calories of jelly, the protein and healthy oils will fuel your body and sustain your energy levels much longer."" Perfect whether you work out post-breakfast or simply want a morning meal that will tide you over until lunch.Low-Calorie Trap: Egg Beaters  Better Bet: Eggs The nutrition facts on a carton of Egg Beaters list no fat, no cholesterol, and less than half the calories of a large egg. But direct your eyes to the ingredients list, says Lauren O'Connor, RD, owner of Nutri-Savvy in Los Angeles. ""They add sugar and fillers, including gums and 'natural flavors,' for taste and texture consistency,"" she says. They also fortify the formula since the nutrient-rich yolk is removed, but why go for something created in a lab when you can get the same nutrition naturally? ""Not only do real eggs offer plenty of protein, their yolks contain carotenoids; vitamins A, D, E, and K; a host of B vitamins, and DHA (an essential omega 3 fatty acid), all important nutrients for your vision, heart, brain, and bones,"" O'Connor says. And if recent headlines have you are worried that eating eggs could be as bad for you as smoking, don’t be. They’re not!Low-Calorie Trap: Low-Fat Cheese  Better Bet: Full-Fat Cheese Yes, an ounce of real cheddar has 65 more calories and 7.5 more grams of fat per ounce compared to reduced-fat cheddar. But if you still haven't gotten the memo: Fat is not the enemy! Cheese is about equal parts protein and fat, the perfect hunger-fighting combo, says Rania Batayneh, MPH, a certified nutritionist and owner of Essential Nutrition for You. Have a low-fat string cheese with grapes, and chances are you'll be pressing E4 on the vending machine a few hours later; have an ounce of the real stuff with your fruit instead, and your stomach won't make any noise. But what about the saturated fat, you say? A Danish study found no change in the LDL (bad) cholesterol of men who ate 10 ounces of full-fat cheese daily for three weeks. Though more research needs to be done, it's likely women would be fine, too -- though we don't recommend eating 10 servings of cheese a day! "
