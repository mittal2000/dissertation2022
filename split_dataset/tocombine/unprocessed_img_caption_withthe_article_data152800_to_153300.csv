But its findings may help revive the credibility of the British drugmaker's original research and shed light on the current U.S. regulatory approach to the health risks posed by new medicines.Avandia was once the world's best-selling treatment for type 2 diabetes, with annual sales of $3.2 billion. Its use was heavily restricted in 2010 because of the possibility of increased risk of heart attack and stroke. It was withdrawn from the market in Europe in 2010, and only 3,000 people in the United States take it today.Glaxo has said it has no plans to promote Avandia again, even if the FDA panel recommends lifting restrictions on sales of the drug, whose generic name is rosiglitazone.The advisory panel session focused on a debate over the value of a Duke University ""readjudication"" of Glaxo's Record safety study that forms the basis for the expert panel's deliberations over the next two days. FDA staff said in briefing documents this week that the Duke analysis backed Glaxo's safety findings for Avandia but also found that scores of smaller trials raised questions over whether the pill increases heart risks.Dr. Thomas Marciniak, medical team leader of FDA's Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products, warned panelists that the readjudication by the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) cannot be considered independent. The effort was financed by and conducted in collaboration with the drugmaker, which has also paid thousands of dollars in consulting fees to Duke's lead investigator, he said.""They got it right for what they were allowed to say,"" said Marciniak. Some Record documents were redacted, he said, and original records of potential adverse events were deleted.""The readjudication was limited because it relies largely on the original database and source documents in collaboration with GSK,"" he added.He offered to treat Glaxo Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty and five of the CEO's colleagues to dinner at an expensive London restaurant if his views prove wrong.Marciniak said it would have been better for FDA to handle all the data on Avandia with company authorization, pointing to concerns that the regulatory agency has less data on Avandia than the Duke researchers. That prompted panel members to express concern about how much proprietary data Glaxo has agreed to share with the agency. NO AVANDIA PROMOTIONResearchers for Glaxo and DCRI defended Duke's reexamination of the Record study as comprehensive and independent and said that it showed no statistically important risk for heart-related deaths from the use of Avandia.But members of the panel still questioned whether the reevaluation of Record offered an adequate assessment of the drug's safety profile.""I'm not aware of any evidence definitively establishing cv (cardiovascular) safety,"" said Dr. Sanjay Kaul of Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in California.""I believe that based on the data that we have been provided, that we have identified all of the events that were reported,"" replied the Duke institute's associate director, Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey.But Mahaffey acknowledged a potential bias in the underlying data and said the Duke team did not systematically investigate the information it received from Glaxo to ensure it was complete: ""We just didn't have the ability to do that.""The panel's patient representative, Rebecca Killion of Washington, D.C., asked FDA officials whether they had received assurances from Glaxo that the information the company provided to Duke researchers had not been altered.""Do we have evidence that there has been willful redaction and withholding of information? That's a very good question,"" replied Dr. Mary Parks, director of FDA's division of metabolism and endocrinology products.But FDA officials pointed out that the data remains the property of Glaxo and is not subject to outside scrutiny. A Glaxo official later told the meeting that the company provided all the data it had to Duke.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover predicted only a slight chance that the meeting will prompt the FDA to ease Avandia sales restrictions significantly.""But if they do, that could signal that the FDA is a little more willing to accept more side effects than it has in the past,"" Conover said.Glaxo has settled lawsuits filed by tens of thousands of U.S. patients who had taken Avandia and claimed the company failed to inform them about risks. Several thousand other cases remain pending. The company last July agreed to pay $3 billion to settle allegations that it failed to provide the FDA with safety data on Avandia and marketed other drugs improperly.European regulators required the Record safety trial over concerns that drugs in Avandia's class - called thiazolidinediones, or TZDs - may increase the risk of heart failure.The FDA clamped down on Avandia's use in September 2010 after an FDA advisory panel voted that the Record data raised significant concerns of a greater risk of heart attack and stroke than other treatments, including Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's Actos, another TZD.Although the FDA allowed Avandia to remain on the U.S. market, it commissioned Duke to analyze results of the Record trial to better assess the drug's safety and to examine criticisms over trial design and how the data was handled.In a briefing document released ahead of the two-day meeting, the FDA said the study's methods and analyses passed muster with the Duke group and that it appeared to agree that Avandia was not associated in the Record trial with increased risk of heart attacks and stroke.Avandia sales had been on a downhill slide since 2007, when Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, said a pooled analysis of 42 studies showed Avandia increased the risk of a heart attack by 43 percent. Sales of Avandia, which was approved in 1999, plunged after the negative publicity.The FDA now requires heart-safety data before approving new diabetes drugs."

2,TRAVEL,London Dining: A Restaurant Is Revived at One Leicester Street,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/london-dining-a-restauran_us_5b9d3529e4b03a1dcc858a2d,One of our favorites restaurants was reborn under the name of One Leicester Street.,2013-06-04,The Facade With Signs From A Previous Existence As Manzi's Seafood Restaurant,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d35282500003600365deb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Some time last year, I read that financial miscalculations -- nothing more sinister than that, I believe -- had sent London's St. John Hotel and Restaurant (a.k.a. St. John Chinatown) into administration, a term of UK legal art that I gather indicates some form of bankruptcy. I was saddened by the prospect of losing a favorite place for a stylish, reasonably simple, delicious meal after the theater but was pretty quickly heartened by the news that the business (separate from the other St. John restaurants, which continue to thrive) would be reborn under the name of One Leicester Street, once the trademark St. John d√©cor (white and plain) had been expunged. The head chef, Tom Harris, would remain along with quite a few of the kitchen, dining room and administrative team, but under the management of the Unlisted Collection hotel-restaurant group.Recently, having traveled to London on a very convenient morning flight (BA's 178 from JFK -- worth getting up early for), Jackie and I arrived in good time for a 10 p.m. reservation to find a friendly welcome and a warm, placid environment -- a pleasant and more normal restaurant d√©cor, to be sure, though without the quirkiness of the old St. John white-box look (and without the St. John conceit of pouring wine and water into identical glasses: perilous if you're drinking a pale white wine). The ever-changing menu is recognizable but isn't a slavish reproduction of the previous regime's: Mr. Harris is running his own show now. If you like St. John-style food -- straightforward but canny, with interesting but not bizarre combinations of good, carefully selected ingredients -- you will certainly feel at home with this menu. And if you were sometimes frustrated by the previous too-idiosyncratic, very French wine selection, as I was, you will rejoice to see a broader range of bottles on the new and evolving list. We started with razor clams, peas and mint: tender, flavorful slices of clam; no-less-flavorful peas (though perhaps a little undercooked); lots of bright mint; herby, slightly garlicky butter to soak up in a piece of the good bread. Another starter was a dish from the old regime: puffed fried pig skins (think of a firmer, porky, spicier version of prawn/shrimp crackers) with a smoked cod-roe dip, which I couldn't have stopped eating if I'd tried, which I didn't. Our substantial main courses were braised broad (fava) beans and wild garlic finished with Berkswell, a sheep's-milk cheese from the West Midlands of England; and cured smoked beef chuck, from the Dexter breed of cattle, served with raw beets, lightly pickled beets and horseradish. Favas can be fresh and springlike -- especially when skinned, a laborious task -- or they can taste a little muddy, which is how lots of people like to eat them. These were the latter; the dish was akin to a stew or thick soup and might have been more successful in a first-course portion a third of the size. The beef was of excellent texture -- tender but with just the right amount of chew -- and full of flavor, though, to my mind, too much of that flavor came from the brine and the smoke. I was interested to see that the same meat is served as a sandwich in the upstairs bar: that would be fabulous, and I mean to have one some day. Desserts -- a honey and brown butter tart and an assemblage of apple, hazelnuts and salty caramel that hit every flavor and texture note on the pastry chef's keyboard -- were of mind-bending deliciousness. Our meal, including service and a bottle of nice (Catalunyan) wine, added up to ¬£110 ($165). One Leicester Street, London WC2H 7BL, +44 (0)20 3301 8020, info@oneleicesterstreet.com. Open every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Despite what the website says, reservations are taken till about 10:30 - not late enough considering the restaurant's proximity to the theaters, but it must be said that the place was winding down by around that hour, so I guess they know what they're doing."

In my first post, here, I offered a reality check on the cheating craze both in K-12 and higher education. It has involved both students and faculty/administrators. You've probably read -- cheating in both high schools and universities has reached an epidemic level. Recently, 125 students at Harvard were investigated for cheating on an exam. Most got suspended. It was the highest number of students punished for cheating to date. But it's likely just the beginning of such penalties. One survey revealed that about three fourths of 1,800 students at nine universities admitted to cheating on tests or assignments. But, is cheating a lost cause? Is it so rampant, all we can hope for is to punish offenders? I sure hope not. Today, I will offer five big action steps I believe we can take to turn the tide. 1. Talk about cheating -- define clearly what it is and why it's wrong. Most kids know it's wrong; after all they try to hide it when they do it. But I have actually met students who are clueless. They only hide cheating so the teacher won't catch them. They don't know it's wrong. So, we must take time, perhaps over coffee, to talk over the moral implications. We don't like it when others cheat us out of something -- a business deal, marriage, finances, etc. Talk about the ""golden rule."" 2. Help them establish their values and illustrate how they look in behavior. No doubt, many students will say we just live in a new day -- everyone is doing it. So why shouldn't they grab what they can? It's important to acknowledge this reality, but explain that all cultures have dynamic values and timeless values. Dynamic ones change over time, like clothing fashions, music styles, hairstyles, and even humor. But each culture must ask themselves: What is timeless? Some morals and values are timeless if a civilization is going to last: honesty, trust, mutual respect, empathy, agreement upon laws and enforcement, etc. Those are the ones we must embrace.3. Create scenarios and test how they do. Depending on the age of your students, create experiences for them to practice their ethics. For instance, one leader took his students to a shopping mall, secretly left a one hundred dollar bill on the floor outside a store and watched if his students returned it to a clerk when they saw it. Another passed out an exam, and four of them had all the answers on the pages. She wanted to see if those four students brought it to her attention. You can get very creative, but it sets up a way to discuss timeless values.4. Discuss ethical alternatives that will give them an advantage. Today, there are plenty of alternatives to cheating, if students will apply themselves to learn them. (In fact, sometimes kids work so hard at cheating, I am sure if they made half the effort to study, they'd get an A on their test). Websites, from the Khan Academy (K-12 education)  to sites that enable college students to study and retain what they've learned in a community are available now to minimize the need to cheat to get a good score. Our brains are incredible instruments if we use them well.5. Discuss cultural realities and how they can use them honestly. As you address this issue with students, keep in mind that they are growing up in a new day, run by Google not Gutenberg. Digital content is much easier to steal; social media makes it quick and simple to plagiarize. So, I believe we need to teach the new ""meta competency"" so many are talking about today: resourcefulness. The art of searching and finding valuable content and solutions. This is certainly the world they will graduate into as adults. Along with cultivating good memories so they can cite dates, wars and eras of history -- we must teach them to use the new age they live in now. Creating and finding solutions are both valuable, honest work.Tell me. What would you add to this list above?"
