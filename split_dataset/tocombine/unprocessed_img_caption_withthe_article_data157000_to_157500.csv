Last week the FAA warned of delays up to 3-1/2 hours at some airports as the agency cuts spending to meet reductions required under federal budget cuts.New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports reported delays of more than an hour, and Philadelphia international airport also reported delays due to furloughs, the FAA said.Los Angeles International reported nearly a two-hour delay at 10 pm ET, and Newark Liberty International reported 28-minute delays, though the FAA could not confirm whether those were related to the staff cuts. Delays of up to 58 minutes in San Francisco and 29 minutes in Orlando, Florida, were due to construction and weather, the FAA said.""Relatively good weather throughout the country and light traffic helped minimize air traffic delays,"" FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said.The delays come as the FAA furloughs its 47,000 employees, including nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers who manage the nation's airspace.The furloughs are set to last through September, the end of the U.S. fiscal year, and are expected to save about $200 million of the $637 million the agency must cut from its $16 billion budget, the FAA said last week.Paul Rinaldi, president of the Air Traffic Controllers Association, said about 1,200 to 1,500 controllers will be staying home each day, on average, and that some airports might be able to shift staffing to reduce the effect of the furloughs. U.S. airports handle about 25,000 flights a day, he said. (Editing by Mary Milliken and Stacey Joyce)"

The news of the week has been overwhelming. Devastating. And it's been tough for me personally not because I know anyone who was impacted directly by the attack in Boston, but because I had to process it alone. Away from my husband and kids and the hugs I so desperately want to give and receive. I was supposed to be away for a three-day business trip. That ballooned into five days, thanks to some nasty weather and hundreds of cancelled flights in the Midwest. When I left on Monday, the world was a different place; I was in a different place. On Sunday, I crossed the finish line at the More/Fitness Women's Â½ Marathon in Central Park; on Monday, when my plane took off, I was still on a runner's high. After running 13.1 miles and then planning dinners and play dates for the brood I was leaving behind, I felt accomplished. I felt good. Really good.And then, as I sat in a hotel room in Chicago, finalizing the presentation I was to give on Tuesday, I heard the news. First, a text from my sister: ""Bomb at Boston Marathon. Not sure what happened."" Then some vague Facebook posts with a common theme about ""sending love to Boston."" Finally, the news. CNN. It was true. There were two bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. That's when the horror started to sink in along with a sadness that has only grown as the days have passed.I feel sad for the victims -- the deceased, the injured and maimed. I feel sad for their families, the survivors, the eye-witnesses. And I feel sad for the runners. Yes, the runners. Having just experienced the elation of crossing the finish line and the pain of getting there, I can't imagine what it would feel like to run so many miles and then, with the finish line in sight, to have to turn around and run for your life. I can't imagine that fear. Although, having been in New York on September 11th, I can relate to what Bostonians have been feeling since Monday.It's not just sadness and fear. It's anger. Uncertainty. Anxiety. There's a sense of guilt you can't quite comprehend. But beyond that, there's pride. Major pride. Pride in your city, your people, your ability to come together. Pride in humanity, in goodness and compassion. And finally, there is hope. A hope that one day might lead us back to optimism, giving the people of Boston -- and all of us -- the strength to live with this new normal. A normal where a major U.S. city goes on lockdown. Where social media helps to find the bad guys. A normal where the rules of society change once again as the sadness and fear subside. Maybe this new normal will mean more bag checks at stadiums or removing our shoes at concerts. Whatever the new normal is, I hope it doesn't stop us from running, from living, from seeing the good in people. I hope the new normal will allow my five kids to be there when I cross my next finish line. And I hope for hugs. For me, for Boston, for all us."

A series of new devices aimed at disabling text capabilities while driving offer sensible options for preventing text messaging in the driver seat. The mobile app, Detext, relies on GPS technology to prevent texting while driving, and the Cellcontrol device utilizes vehicle electronics to recognize the state of the vehicle in coordination with mobile device linkage to restrict texting and driving. Thoughtful drivers and concerned parents may also utilize a series of apps to lower the temptation of texting and driving. DriveMode, from AT&T, silences incoming texts, calls and emails while activated. A similar app, DriveScribe, offers a jamming function to block texts and calls in driving mode.

Although I saw she had left me messages, I immediately called her and was so relieved to simply hear her voice as she told me she was safe, but that bombs had gone off at the marathon and people were dead. I wanted to reach through the phone and pull her back home. I am 3,000 miles away, and each mile has never felt so long. That same evening, my son was flying back from a trip to Ireland. He was on his way to a client meeting in Chicago and changing planes in Washington, D.C. before ultimately heading back to New York City -- all cities considered potential targets. My son is 23 and my daughter is turning 21. That doesn't make me worry about them any less.On Tuesday, I watched Katie Couric interviewing victims and witnesses, including runner Rebecca Roche and her mother, Beth, who was in the hospital with severe leg injuries.What struck me so deeply was when Beth tearfully interrupted her daughter to say, ""You know what was sad? What's sad is that her moment, her dream, was ruined by these people. She worked so long to make this dream come true."" Rebecca looked at her mother and shook her head, disbelieving that this what she was worried about while she had bones sticking out of her leg. But, as a mother, I totally got it.All we want for our children -- universally -- is for them to be happy, healthy and safe. I'm sorry, but I'm sure that's all the mother of these boys -- and they are boys, not men -- wanted, too.Last Thursday night, Sara called to tell us that a police officer had been shot and killed at MIT, which meant that, although she sounded OK, I wasn't going to be getting to sleep anytime soon. I went online to learn more, and posted a link to the story on Facebook. The link was shared by Patti Digh, and a mutual friend sent me good wishes, hoping my daughter was far away from what was happening.Then a true guardian angel came along and sent me a message that made me cry. Melissa Martin -- a woman I have never met before -- wrote, ""Lois, I am here, a few miles North of Boston, in a safe suburb. If she wants/needs a reprieve, please give her my name. She and her friends are welcome to retreat with us."" When I told her how much this meant to me, she wrote, ""Oh, Lois, as the mother of five (with two already in college), I cannot imagine how difficult this week must have been for you. I feel that mothers have a universal protectiveness, whether the child is their own or not. I am on call for any of my kids and 'bonus kids.' Feel free to reach me anytime.""You can bet I will be reaching out to meet this remarkable woman next time I'm visiting my daughter in Boston. Meanwhile, her profound message needs to be shared -- and heeded. Mothers do have a universal protectiveness, and it's up to all of us to be on call for all kids, whether they need something to eat, someplace to stay or someone to just listen to them. I had lunch with my own mom and dad today, and we called Sara together so everyone could hear her voice, even if by that point, she was rolling her eyes. I shared all my feelings about this week with my parents and told them I felt I had to write something. ""You work so hard,"" sighed my mother. ""Don't stay up all night. You need to rest and take care of yourself.""""Ma,"" I whined, closing her car door and waving good-bye.I shook my head but, inside, I was smiling."

How do you live in a world where that is taken away?  You have been profiles in courage. And it saddens me that your courage could not be honored by the passage of sensible gun control legislation.  But if the politicians could not honor and support your courage, then we parents must do it. Because we understand, viscerally, that to parent is to submit to a wrenching vulnerability. Because we have nursed our babies, watched them take their first steps and eagerly listened for their first words -- each of these sacred moments deeply etched into our hearts. Because we understand that to lose our children is an unbearable thought.

Throughout the history of our young science, psychologists have gotten caught up in heated debates over questions like this one. Is intelligence a product of nature, or nurture? Is our personality stable, or does it change? Are our cognitive processes -- like making decisions or forming impressions -- rational, or biased? The answer, of course, always ends up being some version of ""it's both."" Intelligence is clearly influenced by both the genes our parents bequeath to us, and the environment in which those genes express themselves. Personality is somewhat stable -- most of us can see aspects of who we are now in the children we once were -- but people can and do change with experience. And our decisions can be fairly rational, or remarkably biased, depending in part on how much effort and attention we pay to the problem at hand.So it shouldn't surprise you that the answer to the question ""Should I choose a partner that is similar to me, or different?"" is... choose someone who is both. The trick is understanding where similarity matters, and what kinds of differences will benefit you most.Let's start with the differences -- and here, it basically boils down to a particular kind of talent sharing. Research we have conducted with other members of Columbia's Motivation Science Center has shown that people tend to see their goals in one of two ways -- ways that determine their relative strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they work best. If you think about your goals in terms of the potential advancement, accomplishments and rewards they might bring -- in terms of what you would gain if you are successful -- you have what's called a ""promotion focus."" Consequently, your strengths (relative to those who aren't as strongly promotion-focused) include creativity, openness, and the ability to identify and seize new opportunities.If, instead, successfully reaching your goals is about staying safe and secure, and ensuring against any losses -- you have a ""prevention focus."" Prevention-focused people want fulfill their responsibilities, make no mistakes, and keep things running smoothly. Your strengths are careful planning, thoroughness, and solid, realistic reasoning.  Promotion-prevention pairings in relationships might, at first glance, seem like a disaster waiting to happen. He is willing to take a chance on something new, she wants to stick with what has worked before. He is an optimist, she is a skeptic. He is spontaneous, she lives by her daily planner. He speeds, she's quick to put on the brakes to make sure they are heading in the right direction. The opportunities for conflict are endless.But new research that will appear in the journal Social Cognition by MSC Fellow and University of Waterloo psychologist Vanessa Bohns and her colleagues suggests that the best relationships (and by ""best,"" I mean something like ""most adaptive and mutually satisfying"") may in fact be these odd couples. Bohns and colleagues studied both dating and married couples, and found those with mixed-motivations enjoyed greater relationship satisfaction than all-promotion or all-prevention pairings. They argued that this was because of the clear advantages of being able to ""divide and conquer"" your various activities. After all, couples usually have goals related to both advancement and security -- they need to help each other in order to both reach their dreams and fulfill their responsibilities. So each person can take on the tasks that they are best suited for, knowing that their partner has got the rest covered. (He can come up with the plan for a great vacation, she can make sure they actually get there with passports and clean underwear.) With mixed-motivation couples, family life has the potential to be more balanced -- children know how to be optimistic and realistic -- because the partnership contains both the promotion and prevention points of view. But there is one very important caveat, and this is where similarity becomes essential. The couple in question must have shared goals. They need to feel that they are on the same page in terms of what they want in life, and differ only in terms of their preferred ways of getting it.

""With Earth Day upon us I think we might think about what locally grown means and remember that nothing is more local than what grows in your own garden,"" says Rose Marie Nichols McGee of Nichols Garden Nursery in Albany, Ore.Whether you're growing a few herbs on the windowsill of your studio apartment or putting in rows of veggies in your multi-acre backyard, cultivating your own grub is a great way to cut down on your carbon footprint, reduce pesticide load and encourage a produce-heavy diet, full of easy-to-grow, healthy-to-eat crops like microgreens, tomatoes and herbs. ""You can grow a lot of tasty produce in a small space if you're careful about picking the right crops and giving them the right conditions,"" says Roger Doiron, founder of Kitchen Gardens International. ""A good rule of thumb is that you can grow about a half-pound of vegetables in a 1' x 1' space. My wife and I managed to do a lot more than this a few years back when we did the garden math."" Intrigued? Read on for our top tips on growing the healthiest and most successful kitchen garden yet:Use Organic Soil And Fertilizer  ""What you put in your soil goes into your food and eventually your body,"" says Robynne Heymans of Sprout Home, a garden and plant store in New York. ""Fertilizing helps keep the plant healthy and encourages it to produce more food -- it's especially important in containers because the soil is not being traveled by earthworms and beneficial bacteria the way the earth is. You can also use a micrconutrient rich fish or seaweed emulsion each time or every other time you water.""  Mulch  Use at least one inch of mulch in any containers to help keep the soil moist and to add nutrients, which is especially important during the summer and on a rooftop.   Know Your Sun ""Fruiting plants need direct sunlight to produce fruit -- at least six to eight hours every day,"" says Heymans, although she adds that the more sun, the better. Part-sun plants need between four and five hours. But if you're planting inside, consider obstructions to the sun: tress outside the window can curb sun exposure, for instance.Water And Fruit Think about the fruit you eat -- it's mostly water, right? That means you've got to keep your fruiting plants especially well watered. Fruiting plants will need water every day, although they might need it twice a day during the height of summer. ""A plant stressed for water will not have the energy to produce,"" Heymans says. ""Checking the soil daily is the best way to know if your plant is getting enough water. The soil should feel like a well wrung out sponge -- soft and slightly moist.""Live In A City? Try Containers -- And Steer Clear Of Space-Hogs ""In New York City we recommend using raised beds or containers for planting edibles due to the trace amounts of lead, construction debris, chemicals in the ground,"" Heymans says. ""For an urban yard, you'll want to start first with a soil test to make sure there's no lead,"" Doiron says. ""If you get a clean bill of soil health, you can plant pretty much anything although you might want to steer clear of the most space-hungry crops like zucchini, melons and potatoes.""Think Outside The (Garden) Box""In a former life when I was living in Brussels, I grew tomatoes, herbs and salad greens on a rooftop and on windowsills. All of them will grow happily in containers if they have enough sun, water and fertile soil,"" Doiron says. ""For a window box or sill, I would recommend herbs and possibly salad greens. For a balcony that gets at least six hours of sun, you can do all the above plus tomatoes and peppers.""  Grow Leafy Greens ""I think gardeners get a tremendous benefit from growing kale and other vegetable greens,"" says McGee. ""If you grow kale and other mustard greens you harvest from the same plant over and over again. What's more, McGee says, ""Greens are often sprayed for insects and by growing yourself you can take control. Often all that's needed to get rid of aphids is a hard spray of water from the hose. Also the home gardener is in a position to encourage beneficial insects and avoiding the monoculture so prevalent in commercial farming."" Choose Foods You Can Preserve Foods that make good jam, pickles or freeze well are great options to help feed you all year round. And it's easy to find varietals that produce in large amounts. Take for example, strawberries: ""Fresh fully ripened strawberries are incredibly delicious and fragrant. Today we can can select from varieties that put out a big crop at once for making jam or freezing or perhaps a day length neutral variety like Tri-Star or Seascape, which produce small amounts through the season are more to your needs. You can walk out to the garden every summer morning a drizzle and drop a few berries into your breakfast bowl."""
11,WELLNESS,8 Mindful Strategies to Release the Need to Control,"Ronald Alexander, Contributor
Ronald Alexander, PhD is a mind/body psychotherapist, internat...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mindful-control_us_5b9d1047e4b03a1dcc84306b,"Whenever we're facing an unpleasant or alarming situation, we're likely to become anxious and try to figure out what we can do instead of becoming quiet and seeking new ideas or revisiting what worked in the past.",2013-04-21,A woman's outstretched hand gently releases a monarch butterfly into the sky,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1047240000510094edb7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few years ago, in my capacity as a mindfulness-based business coach I was brought into a record company to help resolve a crisis that was plaguing the marketing team. I asked to sit in on their strategy meeting and, within minutes, noticed that they were all fighting for control of the situation. What I observed was that the word ""no"" was used over 75 times in 45 minutes and the word ""yes"" was only used seven times. All were driven by the same fear: that their current number-one recording artist's latest CD wasn't selling as well as expected. Panic had set in, and the shouting and accusations had begun. I knew they could never reverse this situation with such a negative attitude in the room.I asked if I could interrupt and work with them for a few minutes. By taking 12 minutes to practice what was once an ancient meditation practice but is now very mainstream we applied the basic principles of intention setting the mind on a positive outcome coupled with focusing on the breath. After about 15 minutes the group entered what I call in my book Wise Mind, Open Mind the practice of mindful meditative inquiry, and it didn't take long for the group to recognize that they were all experiencing similar fears and concerns. They realized that they all saw the core problem and wanted to solve it, whereas before, all they perceived was a power struggle -- each one determined to win. Now the marketing team was able to find common ground and get to the heart of what had worked for this recording artist in the past. This time I noticed ""no"" was used approximately 16 times and ""YES"" was the predominate word of choice. They finally worked out a solution that the star agreed to and soon after the new marketing push, the recording shot to the top of the charts. Whenever we're facing an unpleasant or alarming situation, we're likely to become anxious and try to figure out what we can do instead of becoming quiet and seeking new ideas or revisiting what worked in the past. We quickly make a decision about our course and focus on getting others to agree to go along with the program. This desire to take control can lead to great suffering.Twenty-five hundred years ago the Buddha understood how to accept the impermanent nature of things, stop clinging and grasping, and let go of the need to control the situation that one can find themselves in. He developed an eightfold path of wise view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration to find balance between acceptance and doing what needs to be done to positively affect your circumstances. Here is a brief synopsis of these strategies from my book, Wise Mind, Open Mind where I give additional practical advice on accepting change.The Eightfold Path to Letting Go of the Need to ControlFirst Path: Wise View In wise view, you recognize that it's not your job, nor is it in your power, to control what happens outside of you. You understand that instead, you can only control what happens within your own mind. Second Path: Wise Intention To exercise wise intention, you must be mindful of any propensity toward allowing your fear to rule you. When operating from a primitive, fearful state, everything seems to be a threat to survival, and the mind begins to justify actions it otherwise would recognize as domineering and manipulative. Third Path: Wise Speech The greater our facility with language, the more tempting it can be to try to control situations through our words. Insults and sarcasm can intimidate others. Gossip and left-handed compliments are also common weapons in the arsenal of one who doesn't exercise wise speech.Fourth Path: Wise Action Wise action means not acting in controlling, manipulative, or coercive ways. It means not being vengeful, regardless of how badly you've been hurt. The thirst for revenge comes from clinging to the past and to the lost opportunity to prevent suffering. People can obsess over what they should've done differently, and sometimes that obsession turns into vengefulness as they try to ""right"" a wrong. Fifth Path: Wise Livelihood Livelihood refers not just to what you do for a living but your purpose, which weaves meaning into every action. Whatever you spend your time doing, whatever it is that gives you a sense of purpose, Buddhist tradition says that you must do it mindfully, giving it the focus and effort it deserves. Sixth Path: Wise Effort To exercise wise effort is to focus and discipline your mind to align it with your wise intention. It's very easy to resort to controlling behavior in a difficult situation, even if you intend not to. Wise effort requires letting go of what no longer works and engaging in courageous new actions that leads to transformation.Seventh Path: Wise Mindfulness Mindfulness is what grounds you in the present so that when you start to drift off into obsessing about the past, or start making plans to wrest control of a situation, you instead stop and look deeply at your negative and controlling patterns. Being fully focused on what's happening in the moment, experiencing your unwholesome and painful feelings, requires what I call ""mindstrength,"" the ability to very quickly and easily shift out of a reactive mode and become fully present in the moment. Eighth Path: Wise Concentration By exercising wise concentration, you remain present in your awareness of a situation exactly as it is, and instead of being reactive, you'll find that you suddenly know how to respond to it in a wholesome, productive way. You'll be able to focus on what's going on inside you instead of what's going on outside of you. So take a deep breath inhale and exhale, set your mind on what you wish, and await a more positive outcome.

The new 180,000 square feet facility is triple the size of the previous delivery center.

And that's great news for those of us who fly, especially in the back of the plane.   Photo Credit: (cc) Flickr.com/Kentaro Iemoto A lot has been made of the fuel efficiency and the 30% larger, electronically-dimming windows, but the real advance for travelers is the air quality. You might not appreciate it on a short flight, as veteran travel reporter Stephanie Rosenbloom at the New York Times observed on her test flight, but flying across the Pacific to Japan as we did shortly before the flights were grounded, the difference was striking.The strength of the Dreamliner's carbon-fiber frame allows it to be pressurized to the equivalent of 6,000 feet, not the 8,000 foot level of conventional aircraft, allowing more oxygen in the cabin air. Less metal in the plane's construction means the plane can be humidified up to a 15% moisture level instead of the typically desert-like 4% in a conventional plane. And the Dreamliner has an additional air filtration system that ""removes odors, irritants and gaseous contaminants"" from the cabin (the latter refers, i think, to the air-pressure equalizing emanations from your fellow passengers). Say goodbye to that dry, scratchy throat and vague headachy feeling that inevitably accompany long-haul flights. The significant air quality improvement of the Dreamliner is a major advance for travelers. Of course, these new planes are outfitted with the latest in ergonomically-designed seats, electronic connectivity (like USB-charging at your seats), mood lighting, great headroom and spacious overhead bins. As for the problematic lithium batteries, they have been re-engineered to prevent the kind of cascading meltdown that led to the grounding. And as soon as the FAA signs off, Dreamliners will take to the skies once more. I can't wait to fly it again.We flew the Dreamliner on Japan Airlines from Boston to Tokyo using an American AAdvantage 25,000 mile one-way, off-peak award -- one of the best mileage redemption options available.

In honor of National Stress Awareness Month, our goal is to use these two weeks to focus on becoming less stressed and more calm. Today's expert is Drew Ramsey, M.D., an assistant clinical professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and author of ""The Happiness Diet"" and the forthcoming ""50 Shades of Kale,"" who will be focusing on the connection between foods, eating behaviors and increased stress. Read through today's challenge, then tell us -- either in the comments, on Facebook or @HealthyLiving -- how it's going. Just joining us? Catch up on what you've missed here and sign up to receive newsletters for the rest of the challenge here.Earlier in the challenge, Ramsey talked about foods that increase stress, but there are just as many foods -- and ways of eating -- that can actually improve stress response and mood. ""Stress is bad, but one reason why stress is bad is it increases inflammation,"" said Ramsey. ""There's really interesting data on omega-3 fats, which mediate stress response. One study looked at medical students, who are obviously chronically stressed, chronically sleep deprived. They found that students who took fish oil pills containing omega-3s reduced their symptoms of anxiety by 20 percent and also reduced blood markers of inflammation.""What's more, how you eat can play a role in the way food affects your feelings of stress or well-being. ""Beyond its nutrients, food is experientially valuable. Make sure during meal times you sit down, that you chew your food, that you become mindful. The same qualities that make yoga and meditation healthy for us and reduce stress can be applied to meal times,"" said Ramsey.Eat Thankfully: ""Every night when we eat dinner, we have a moment of silence for 30 seconds, try to center down and focus on the food in front of us,"" Ramsey said. ""It's a way to practice things that are good for mental health. I focus intently on what Iâm eating, I give gratitude for the food, thankful in a non-denominational way and I try to really pay attention to the food: its color, texture, smell. Itâs a way of trying to pivot away from the stressors of my day.""Keep ""Stress"" Foods On-Hand: ""We all stress eat, so why not make it productive? Food is soothing, but use that to really battle the stress. If youâre having a horrible day in the office, taking a handful of almonds and sitting in a quiet room and eat them slowly, one at a time. Focus on their taste, their mouthfeel. Some dark chocolate and almonds from your desk is way better and just as stress-relieving as going to the vending machine and getting a candy bar.""Go Probiotic: The probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to decrease anxiety in mice, according to the latest research. ""This probiotic alters the mRNA expression of both GABAA and GABAB receptors in the central nervous system. Alterations in these receptors are associated with anxious and depressive-like behaviors in animal models,"" explains Ramsey.What bad eating habit can you change in the name of de-stressing?
