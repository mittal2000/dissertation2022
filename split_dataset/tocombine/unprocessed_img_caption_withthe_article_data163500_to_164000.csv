Scientists from the national park, the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) and the Charles Darwin Foundation, as well as WellMed Foundation sponsors, have launched an investigation to unravel the mysteries of the whale shark, a species believed to be present in the oceans for at least 60 million years. The first stage of the study involves placing transmitters on the sharks, said marine biologist Eduardo Espinosa. (AP Photo/The Galapagos National Park of Ecuador)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd20625000035003638de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new study conducted at Imperial College London used a collection of tourist snapshots to identify migratory sharks in the Maldives using the fingerprint-like spots on their massive backs.The study, by Tim Davies, is big news not just because it will allow shark scientists the world over to track a mysterious if photogenic species but also because it finally puts tourist snapshots to good use. If vacation photos become more than a way to make Facebook friends green with envy, the relationship between visitors and places might just deepen.The whale shark study is a reversal of the more traditional crowdsourcing model in which large numbers of people sort through impossibly large sets of data, like the SnapshotSerengeti.org project, which has asked armchair trekkers to classify animals caught on remote cameras in Kenya. A closer cousin to the whale shark project might be the efforts by the Max-Planck-Institut fur Astronomie to use thousands of images on the Internet to track the flight of the Holmes comet.What does all this mean for travelers? That, finally, the records of their experiences can have immense value. The study is a call to arms as well as an invitation to rethink the classic stereotype of the bewildered tourist taking casual photos. Rather than seeing tourism as an act of ignorance, scientists can now use a shared curiosity to help save the places and animals people want to visit.Instead of paging through troves of Instragram pictures of the Santa Monica Pier or Disney World, scientists can now look further afield for tremendous opportunities. Tourists are no longer simply seeing places, but helping us all understand them better."
1,DIVORCE,5 Tips On How To Fall In Love On Valentine's Day,"Marina Pearson, Contributor

It's disheartening to see couples coming together to show their love for each other when you are sitting home alone, eating chocolates -- and lonely.I've found that the best way to attract new love into your life is to start by doing loving things for yourself.  Why not start on Valentine's Day? Below, I've compiled a list of 5 things that you can do for yourself on this day.  1) Buy yourself something really nice  Valentines Day is about love. However no one ever said that you couldn't buy something nice for you. Rather than waiting for someone else to buy you what you want, why not go do it yourself? Think about what you would want to be gifted by your ideal date and go buy it!  So what will it be? Flowers, chocolates, some nice negligee?  It may feel uncomfortable at first, but the first step in attracting a new relationship in your life is to become whom you want to attract. Loving yourself harder is a sure way to find someone to love you more quickly.  2) Do something you haven't done before  Use the day to do something really nice for yourself that you have never done on your own before. Just like with the gift, spoil yourself with going for a massage, sauna or even take yourself out for dinner. Why expect someone else to take you out for dinner, when you won't?  3) Get together with other single friends  If having dinner on your own is too daunting, then make a date of it with single friends. If most of your friends are still in relationships, see if spending time with them is a option. If you have been single for a while, take this opportunity to join groups where you can meet people who are single and who can becomes friends. Sometimes when a relationship ends, your social circle will change and it is important to venture out and attract a new social circle if you want to truly move on.  4) Create a love nest at home  If you don't want to go out or cannot, then create a love nest at home. Turn your environment into a place that makes you feel loved and gives you at feeling that love is in the air (with yourself). Light some candles, decorate the house with flowers, surround yourself with some loving music and immerse yourself in the beauty around you.  5) Do something nice for someone else  The power of giving is so powerful. Even though you may not feel your best, there are people who are worse off. People who are homeless or sick may need your help. Wouldn't it be amazing to give back to those that need it most on a day that represents love? Not only will it make you feel amazing, but you will be making a massive difference to those who you decide to volunteer the help for.  In short, Valentines Day can turn into a day of self-love and giving. Celebrate who you are and what you have got! As you do have a lot.

Pellegrino Worlds 50 Best Restaurants Award, which was awarded in London last night. AFP PHOTO/ Casper Christoffersen/SCANPIX DANMARK (Photo credit should read Casper Christoffersen/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd1872100003100c54701.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells reviewed Aska, a Scandinavian restaurant in Brooklyn, in the newspaper's Dining section this week. It's a positive review -- two stars -- but it's actually less important as a signpost toward one good restaurant than as a herald of changes in the way American diners think of Scandinavian food.Until recently, in-the-know diners were dimly aware of a renaissance in the upscale dining scenes in Scandinavian cities, including Stockholm and Copenhagen. They had probably heard of Noma restaurant in Denmark and its famous chef Rene Redzepi, at least if they had a subscription to The New York Times or The New Yorker. Some especially devout gastronauts were perhaps also aware that Scandinavian techniques and methods had started to influence the way American cooks of other cuisines approached their own food. Of course, Americans didn't think of Scandinavian food at all five or 10 years ago, so even this was remarkable. But many people in this last category had never tasted the new Scandinavian cuisine for themselves, at least if they didn't travel to the Baltic region, because there just weren't many Scandinavian restaurants around. And those that did open weren't necessarily successful. Vandaag in the East Village, for example, served Scandinavian-inflected Dutch food to glowing reviews, but small crowds, for less than two years before it closed in May.But today, an increasing number of diners take Scandinavian cooking seriously as an option for Friday night dinner in their own backyards. There are now at least three successful Scandinavian restaurants in New York in addition to Aska: Aquavit in Midtown, Atera in Tribeca and Acme in NoHo. (I'm going to go ahead and chalk up to coincidence the fact that the names of all four start with the letter ""A."") Meanwhile, San Francisco's Plaj has gotten plenty of press, and Minneapolis, which has a large Scandinavian American population, has apparently developed a thriving community of Nordic cuisine.Still, Scandinavian cuisine is likely to remain a hard sell to many American diners. It's not rich like French, Italian or Southern food, and it's not spicy like Chinese, Thai or Indian. And many of its ingredients, especially fresh fish, are on the pricey side. Then again, the same could be said of Japanese food, which hasn't been considered exotic in parts of the U.S. since at least 1985. "

Your anger is all about guns, about media, about income equality. You begin by thinking, I'm a dad. What are the things I can control to make sure that my boy doesn't grow up to be a man, in fatigues, walking into a school with a gun? You hope that other parents think the same. In past generations, the business of being a dad wasn't much easier, but it was certainly less complex. Dad was expected to be the primary income earner and to serve as mom's ""nuclear option"" on the discipline front. Mothers maintained the homestead, making sure the kids had manners and that they would never be accused of things like being raised in a barn.Today the silent majority of dads are adjusting to a blended role: part breadwinner and part homemaker, IT support, repairers-of-all and doers of disgusting jobs. Most importantly, dads are now on the frontlines of discipline. We are no longer getting the call up in the box. We are on the field with Mom, calling the penalties. The world outside our homes has also changed. Media is a much bigger part of our children's lives (just look at how many babies can work a touchscreen before they know how to use a fork). More than any other generation, they're exposed to a never-ending flow of information that is almost impossible to monitor. And they have greater access to TV shows, movies and video games than ever.Welcome to modern fatherhood, where changing dirty diapers is the least of your concerns. You are up for a battle against media -- a Daddy David against a media Goliath that is not only funnier but a whole lot cooler. This isn't an anti-gun control argument, or an argument that exclusively lays the blame for gun violence on media, but rather a reminder that good dads need to first take stock of the things that they control. Certainly you can make sure that assault rifles aren't in your house, though it's less easy to ensure that they aren't in the houses of your neighbors. You can make sure that you control your child's exposure to violent movies or video games that glorify or desensitize violence. Because even if you aren't absolutely sure that violent media leads to violent acts, you've likely had that same needling feeling that I've had after my sons see something too violent for their ages.Part of our reluctance to be a filter for our children is the fact that many of us are happy consumers of violent media. Perfectly functioning young fathers play Grand Theft Auto or Modern Warfare and are huge Tarantino fans, but we should remember that many of us lived at least part of our lives in a time when most media violence was more laughable than graphic, and video games consisted of making sure that Pac-Man was well fed rather than calling in air strikes. Our kids haven't had this life experience as a counterbalance to the media they consume. The world around us is the world they know.Another source of reluctance is the new role of parent-as-friend rather than authority figure. We are willing to do everything necessary to be a good parent, so long as it doesn't make us uncool in our children's eyes. Managing our children's media consumption definitely falls in the category of uncool, so we cede a critical part of our parenting duties to commercial forces.But when you look at a list of dead children your own child's age, being a cool dad is the least of your concerns. You've had your time as cool, and you'll trade coolness for a world at least as good -- or better than -- the one you were a child in. One where children can go to school without the fear of being harmed. This means actively monitoring, restricting or discussing the media your children consume.No one said it would be easy. Welcome to filterhood."

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd1582200005700d963d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Pope underwent surgery a few months ago to install a pacemaker in his body, according to news reports. The Vatican said that the pacemaker did not play a role in 85-year-old Pope Benedict's decision to resign, Reuters reported There were not many details released as to why Pope Benedict had the pacemaker installed, but most people get them because of an abnormal heart rhythm, a condition called arrhythmia. The Mayo Clinic reported that the heart may beat abnormally because of aging, damage from a heart attack, medications or a genetic condition. It's important to address an abnormal heartbeat -- whether it's too fast, a condition called tachycardia, or too slow, a condition called bradycardia -- because it can affect how much blood the body receives from the heart, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. A pacemaker works by sending electrical pulses to the heart muscle, The Cleveland Clinic explained. Different types work in different ways, depending on the condition a person has, but generally it's implanted underneath the skin and then hooked up to the heart with wires. The American Heart Association reported that the pacemaker only sends out the electric pulses when necessary, like when the heart is beating abnormally. The battery that powers a pacemaker usually lasts sometime between five and eight years before it needs to be replaced. People who have a pacemaker installed can usually lead full, active lives, according to the American Heart Association, though doctors encourage some precautions (such as seeing how much exercise is safe).

Professor & Founder of Fashion Law Institute",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fashion-week-sustainability_us_5b9ccdb6e4b03a1dcc8202cb,"As the fashion world incorporates environmental and other ethical concerns into brand identity, sustainability is becoming the new normal. In other words, eco-chic is going mainstream.",2013-02-12,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 05: A model walks in the Organic by John Patrick Spring 2013 presentation during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week on September 5, 2012 in New York City. (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ccdb61f00005100215ed3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pantone's color of the year for 2013 may be emerald, but the collections at New York Fashion Week are lush with many shades of green. From linden to deep lichen, designers are using the colors of nature to make fashion come to life.The literal abundance of green on the runways is also a fashion statement that reflects a deeper trend within the industry. As the fashion world incorporates environmental and other ethical concerns into brand identity, sustainability is becoming the new normal. In other words, eco-chic is going mainstream.How did green fashion go from being associated with shapeless, colorless, scratchy garments made for a niche anti-fashion customer to being a paragon of luxurious fabrication, cutting-edge style and steady market growth? Part of the answer lies in changes in regulation, but other factors have been on display at Fashion Week itself.Blending into the mainstreamPerhaps the most important reason for green's growth throughout the fashion scene is a deliberate shift toward presenting sustainable fashion as not separate and unique, but simply fashion at its best. The Organic by John Patrick line exemplifies this trend -- other than the reference to organic in the name, the clothes stand on their own as wearable commercial looks apart from any environmental claims. Other eco-friendly lines are also presenting themselves as equals in the Fashion Week milieu; notable examples include the Dolphin Organic skin care line and VOZ, which pursues ""change through beauty"" by working with skilled artisans to create sustainable style. Maria Cornejo (left) with model wearing her recycled cassette tape suitBranding green fashion as the new normal is likewise becoming a common practice within the broader fashion world. Designer Stella McCartney and prominent influencers such as Livia Firth and Vogue have long promoted the integration of sustainability into luxury style. American Apparel and Footwear Association Maverick Award-winning designer Yeohlee Teng has made local, zero-waste production an invisible but omnipresent part of her signature style, from using manufacturers in New York's Garment District to reusing pins from her studio floor. The same goes for Diane von Furstenburg and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, who have helped mainstream green design through the CFDA/Lexus Eco-Fashion Challenge. One of the designers to win the inaugural award, Maria Cornejo, quietly uses environmentally friendly materials in her signature line, which has been worn by First Lady Michelle Obama -- without a single mention of kale.TransparencyThe styles shown at Fashion Week appear online within seconds of coming down the runway. This same immediacy also applies to information about the supply chain. Production in a foreign country no longer hides environmental harm from view -- carbon dioxide output, photographs of water pollution, waste disposal practices and even micro-analysis of the chemical composition of textile treatments are often just a URL away.The resulting transparency has helped promote environmental consciousness throughout the image-conscious fashion business. Among designers and retailers, integrating stronger standards has become essential if they want to avoid becoming part of a negative news item themselves. Knowing more about the fashion industry has also affected consumers, for whom fashion is an extension of their personal identity.Meaningful standardsBoth government regulators and the industry itself have taken steps to make sure that environmental consciousness is not simply a marketing gimmick. Late last year the Federal Trade Commission issued a revised, more rigorous version of its Green Guides, which provide standards to keep claims about eco-friendliness from being deceptive. Designers, retailers and nonprofits are also working together to develop new environmental impact standards. The most high-profile example of this is the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, an initiative spearheaded by such companies as Levi's, Burberry, Nike and Patagonia.Technological innovationAttendees at Fashion Week are used to reading descriptions of the styles coming down the runway. However, technology chic is becoming an equally important part of the fashion scene, as designers pursuing sustainable fashion describe in detail the how their creations are produced. Techniques for repurposing vintage clothes, new methods for producing carbon-neutral yarn, advanced technology for waterproofing, strategies for zero-waste production -- designers have begun using Fashion Week to explain the science behind the style.Creative energy Green goes pink at Organic by John PatrickFor years, sustainable fashion had a reputation for dull colors and drab designs. That is rapidly changing, and not only because of such eco-conscious fashion celebrities as Stella McCartney. For instance, Organic by John Patrick's fall 2013 show generated buzz with eco-friendly looks that included hot pink, cropped sweaters, and on-trend longer hemlines. Similarly, Vaute Couture, the first all-vegan line to show at Fashion Week, won kudos for its ""faux meets fabulous"" collection inspired by anime heroine Sailor Moon.Social brandingBeyond online social media such as Twitter and Facebook, creating real-world connections has also proven to be an effective way of making eco-chic more than a niche market. Vaute Couture offers a stellar example of a brand that is a building a community that associates green fashion with celebration rather than sacrifice. Vaute's fashion show was held in a Meatpacking district warehouse designed to feel like a club, complete with a DJ, open space and creative lighting. While people waited for the show to begin, staff joined in conversations and passed out brownies. The Humane Society, a show's nonprofit co-sponsor, served as an equally integral part of the show. Models carried puppies available for adoption, and afterwards Humane Society volunteers were available to help make those adoptions happen. The result was an event that made people feel that they are more than nameless customers -- they are part of the Vaute Couture family. Electric blue Vaute Couture  All in all, Fashion Week's embrace of environmental awareness illustrates how green fashion and the broader fashion world are starting to converge. While following fashion can never be truly thrifty -- as Shakespeare noted, fashion does indeed wear out more apparel than the man -- sustainable style is a lifestyle trend that's here to stay.With contributions by Jeff Trexler, attorney and professor of Fashion Ethics, Sustainability, and Development for the nonprofit Fashion Law Institute, located at Fordham Law School."

Kids, the elderly, CEOs, celebrities, housewives and politicians all do it. It can be done in schools, hospitals, boardrooms, town halls, or your own living room. Meditation is now written into TV dramas. Cross-legged yogis and monks can be seen in computer and credit card ads, while newspapers and magazines publish meditation tips from famous film stars. In our local post office, fliers advertising meditation and yoga classes hang next to overseas postal prices.Meditation doesn't belong to anyone, nor is it exclusive to any particular religion, belief, or doctrine. There are as many forms of meditation as there are people who practice, and it's of value to all. It's as simple and normal as breathing. The Dalai Lama, probably the world's most famous meditator, says that meditation is like cookery: ""You wouldn't merely read recipes with approval, you'd try them out. Some you'd like and would use again. Like cookery, meditation only makes sense if you put it into practice.""We have both been doing it, writing about it, and teaching it for more than 40 years and couldn't image how we could survive without it. In that time, we've seen how easily people get confused or miss the point, believing meditation means having to stop their thinking (which is as pointless as trying to catch the wind) or do complicated techniques to reach an unrealistic place of perfect bliss. But remember, saints get headaches, the Buddha had a stomachache, Oprah has bad hair days. We're all ordinary, and meditation is no big deal -- it's just being quiet with ourselves, as we are. It is more of an undoing than a doing. It enables us to witness how our mind jumps from one drama to another, it dissolves mental clutter, frees us of habitual patterns, helps release stress, and feels wonderfully peaceful. The type or method of meditation is not the point, as it is simply an aide. It's not the experience itself. Everyone is different, what works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another. A hammer can help build a house, but it is not the house. No one practice is better than another; they are simply methods that give our chattering minds something to do other than drive us crazy, thereby allowing us to be still. Meditation is waking up from the misconception that the intellectual and rational mind is the whole picture. It is the realization of the brilliance of who we truly are. Someone once asked Ed if he had ever experienced another dimension. Ed replied: ""Have you ever experienced this one?"" As a result of meditation, our mind becomes clear of obscuration, our heart as big as the universe. We are awake, free, spontaneous, and in the moment.

The coincidence of the 15th highest tide in the history of the city and a heavy snowfall has left travelers and locals alike a little bit chilly and damp even as it accomplished the impossible, making Europe’s most romantic city even more photogenic.The Piazza San Marco looked like the North Sea Monday as crews hustled to bring chairs and bandstands inside. Masks and waders quickly became the styles du jour as revelers refused to have their good time dampened. According to Corriere Del Veneto, a local paper, the water level in much of the city was well over a meter.Images released by The Daily Mail showed fancy hotels being flooded.Fortunately, photographers were on hand to capture the beauty of the sinking city and the joy of the people who refused to stay indoors.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd02724000050005358f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama's high-speed rail plans may have hit a few major snags over the years, but that hasn't stopped some people from keeping the vision alive, and graphic artist Alfred Twu is among them. Twu's map, as Slate points out, is more ambitious than Obama's $8 billion plan. Unlike Obama's proposed plan to draw trains down the East Coast and better connect cities in California, Twu's map would easily connect New York and Los Angeles, with Chicago acting as a major hub of all high-speed rail throughout the country. The map is a visionary's dream; could high-speed rail be as successful in America as it is in, say, Europe or even China? Departing Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood told HuffPost at the end of January that America ""is behind"" on high-speed rail and that as long as Obama is in the White House, his Transportation Secretary should make rail a priority. What do you think? Are you impressed by the map? Would you travel from Los Angeles to New York via train?

12,DIVORCE,It's Valentine's Day. Now What?,"Claire N. Barnes, MA, Contributor
Claire is an international educator, published author and nonp...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-valentines-day-now-wh_us_5b9cca9de4b03a1dcc81e509,It was bound to happen -- you are facing Valentine's Day as a newly separated adult and you don't quite know what to do with yourself.,2013-02-12,Charming Woman eating lunch and drinking wine in a kitchen,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cca9d2500003500363591.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was bound to happen -- you are facing Valentine's Day as a newly separated adult and you don't quite know what to do with yourself. The good thing is that you no longer have to stand in front of the display of Valentine cards and try to find one expressing how you really feel, like you did last year and the year before. That's always a sign the relationship is winding down -- when you can no longer find a card expressing your true feelings.It's amazing how much focus we give to commemorate a celebration created in the Middle Ages. English writer Geoffrey Chaucer first mentioned Valentine's Day in a poem written to celebrate the engagement of two royals who were just fifteen years old. From this simple beginning has emerged a multi-million dollar industry that encourages us to buy cards, candy, flowers, restaurant dinners and red clothing. Now that you are transitioning into your newly separated life, maybe it's time to rethink Valentine's Day. Find an alternative for the twenty-four hours approaching on February 14. Here are some ideas to get you started:Throw a small, intimate dinner party for adults. Invite only close friends who know about the changes in your life and ask each of them to bring their specialty dish. You can keep the Valentine's theme of red or, like Alice in Wonderland's UnBirthday celebration, you can make it an Un-Valentine's Day celebration. Be creative and start your own, new tradition.Go to or rent a movie you have been dying to see. One caveat: you might want to avoid those with romantic themes. The movie options now are terrific as the Oscar race heats up and there must be one on your list you haven't seen.If your children are home, plan to do something nice together for a neighbor or elderly person. Research shows that helping others or volunteering your time and energy protects you against stress and depression when you're going through challenging times. Focusing on others may help you avoid feeling sorry for yourself.Take a long weekend. Since Valentine's Day falls on a Thursday this year, maybe you want to plan a small getaway or even a staycation at home. Spend the money you're saving on cards, candy and flowers on a mini vacation. Use this time to write in your journal and memorialize how you are easing through this time of transition. Meditate and imagine what your life will be like in 2014. Chart your life course for this year. Write down your goals in small increments so you can track your achievement. Turn off and tune out by taking a vacation from electronics. You might be pleasantly surprised at the thoughts and ideas you create free from external stimulation. Celebrate what you love. There must be something you love to do that your former partner didn't appreciate. Whether it's watching silent movies, cooking with garlic, watching on-demand reruns of your favorite television show or planning a dream vacation, set aside time on February 14 to do it and validate your own interests.Make no mistake, getting through this holiday early in a split can be challenging. If you are a newly separated parent, how you conduct yourself during challenging times will be remembered and modeled by your children. These suggestions may seem like common sense and easy, but when your emotions are charged and you are upset, using common sense suggestions as an anchor can be a comfort.It's a new life, a new you and a new beginning. Seize it!"
