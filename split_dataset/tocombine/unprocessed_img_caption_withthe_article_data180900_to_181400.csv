Having been warned about a potential let-down period once all the excitement dies down, I was grateful, when we arrived at Maroma Resort the following day, that our marital bliss would continue.We promised each other on the plane ride over that now that we were married, wife and wife, we would never, to other people, be anything less. From that point on, when asked by anyone about our relationship, we would answer with the truth. We had occassionally skirted this area in the past; sometimes it was just easier, more comfortable, to go along with whichever label we were given. But this was the beginning of a new life for us and there would be no shame or fear.So when our driver asked us on the way to the resort if we were sisters...Susan said, “No she’s my esposa.”The driver laughed and said “Esposa? No, no.”Susan said “Yes, esposa.”“Esposa means wife” he said, laughing.“I know.”“Ohhhhhhh” he replied, with a huge grin. This kicked off a crazy Spanglish conversation that lasted the entire 45-minute ride.We were greeted with margaritas upon arrival. One of the beautiful (all bronze and stunning) hostesses provided us with details about the resort while we took in the ocean, the candlelit walkways, the lizards sitting beneath us, and our incredibly strong cocktails. Once we finished our conversation we stumbled to our villa, the quintessential honeymoon suite, with rose petals leading to the bed, hand-painted tile, French doors to our private patio, and a huge sunken tub that would be our oasis every afternoon.Seven days of pure luxury. Having provided our names to the staff the first night at dinner, we were never asked again -- only greeted at each meal with a charming “Hola! Brandy and Susan!” We sat under the moonlight, waves crashing below as the band sang Besame Mucho to (it felt like) only us. It seemed all the staff knew we were newlyweds. When Susan got to the restaurant before I did they asked, “Where’s your wife?”It felt good to be honest, to be accepted, to be celebrated.After a few days of bliss at Maroma we decided to venture out to Playa Del Carmen, which was a 15-minute drive from our slice of heaven. I actually debated stepping foot out of the resort, but since we hadn’t done one touristy thing (our preferred method of travel) we figured we might as well do something other than eat, drink, and have sex.Gorgeous Hostess #3 called us a cab and off we went. “Esposa” came up again. Same thing, same reaction, same “ohhhhh” followed by another Spanglish exchange to entertain us the entire way.It was hot and stuffy and there were people everywhere. We devised a fast plan to pick up gifts for our friends back home, eat, and get the hell out of there. We roamed in and out of shops empty handed. We went into one store and a machismo clerk began following us around the store asking how he could help, what we were looking for, and then, “Are you sisters?” I put my head down and walked in the other direction, leaving Susan to do the deed.“No, she’s my esposa,” Susan said, with confidence. I was proud.In one instant his voice went from that of a tough, Latino man to the highest pitched gay voice you could imagine.“Oh, really?! This is my boyfriend right here!” he said, grabbing the other sales clerk lingering in the aisle. “We can tell you where all the gay bars are!”They congratulated us on our recent matrimony and mapped out a bunch of bars that we never stepped foot in. We left with a great deal of stuff that I’m sure our friends threw away and reassurance once again that the truth really does set you free.Brandy Black is Editor-in-Chief and Founder of The Next Family, she lives in Los Angeles with her wife and three children.Click through the slideshow below for the latest findings on same-sex weddings.Also On The Next FamilyAlone with you in the Supply Closet Honeymoon in Maroma: Pure Bliss Turned to Total FearMarriage and Kids: Sticking It Out "
1,WELLNESS,How to Train Like an Olympic Gymnast,"Ben Greenfield, Contributor

China's Deng Linlin won gold while Sui Lu won the silver medal, with Alexandra Raisman of the United States taking the bronze medal. AFP PHOTO / EMMANUEL DUNAND (Photo credit should read EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c169e1f00002d0021168e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ever wonder how Olympic gymnasts achieve that ultimate combination of lean muscle, incredible flexibility, and impressive bodyweight-to-strength ratio? Well, training for years and years from a very young age certainly plays a significant role. But there are training moves that you can learn from Olympic gymnasts to give you some of their enviable physical features.The Floor When gymnasts take to the floor, you'll witness a series of tumbling passes that demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. Floor routines typically last just a little over a minute, and require a combination of cardiovascular endurance and explosiveness. Two exercises that can get you tumbling like a gymnast are squat-thrust jumps and somersault pushups. Challenge yourself by trying 60 seconds of each exercise.The HorseA pommel horse routine involves single leg and double leg swings, scissors, and other intense moves, while supporting the body with the arms. The amount of core strength and skill required for this routine is incredible, but you can start to build horse-ready abs by beginning with a more simple exercise: lying scissors. Try kicking in and out for 25 repetitions, then rest 30 seconds and repeat for three to five sets. The RingsRings are suspended on cables, and the gymnast must hang from the rings for his routine, while preventing the rings themselves from swinging. The rings require extremely solid and well-balanced shoulder muscles, combined with lower abdominal strength. A hanging leg raise is a great exercise to simulate the strain of the rings. If you're just getting started, try a single hanging leg raise (in which you raise one leg instead of two), or if your legs and abs need more of a challenge, try a double. Be sure not to let your shoulders ""slouch"" as you do this exercise. If you can do 10 controlled hanging double leg raises, you're well on your way to trying out the rings.The VaultTo do the vault, a gymnast sprints 20-25 meters down a runway and then hurdles onto a spring board, often throwing multiple twists and somersaults before landing. This routine requires a combination of leg speed, hip power, and extreme body awareness in the air. While sprinting followed by hurdling may not be possible in your particular exercise setting, you can try one of my favorite quick and explosive exercise routines: a 10 by 10 on the treadmill. To perform this, simply set the treadmill on as high an incline and speed as possible, then run explosively for 15 seconds. Rest 30-60 seconds, and then repeat, for a total of 10 treadmill sprints.The Parallel BarsFor the parallel bars, the gymnast suspends himself with his hands slightly further than a shoulder's width apart on each bar, and then executes a series of swings, balances, and releases that, similar to the rings, require great amounts of shoulder and core strength. To get a feel for the kind of burn a gymnast will experience during this routine, try performing as many body weight dips as you can in 60 seconds, trying to get your elbows down to 90 degree angle with each dip. If you can get to 15, you're off to a great start!The High BarThe high bar is a thick bar that the gymnast must hold onto as he performs circles around the bar with multiple twists, releases, and changes of direction. While gymnasts use leather grips, chalks, and even honey to get a better grip on the bar, they must also have extremely strong hands and forearms. If you want to get a grip like a gymnast, try the one-two combo of the deadlift to the pull-up. It will not only give you a strong grip, but also work your arm and upper back muscles. If you can perform 10 body weight deadlifts followed by 10 body weight pull-ups, you may want to send in your application for the Olympic gymnastics team -- just as soon as you perfect that landing.Do you have other favorite exercises that would make for a great Olympic gymnast training routine?

When you're in the thick of it, it's hard to imagine you'll ever come out the other side alive -- let alone smiling.",2012-08-09,"NEW YORK, NY - MARCH 03: Cat Ommanney attends Cat Ommanney's 'Inbox Full' book party at Ted Gibson Salon on March 3, 2011 in New York City. (Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1c581f000050002118b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Breaking up is never easy. When you're in the thick of it, it's hard to imagine you'll ever come out the other side alive -- let alone smiling. A few months ago, I got in touch with Cat Ommanney, star of the popular reality show ""Real Housewives of DC"". She'd tweeted about my website, neverlikeditanyway.com, and I thought I'd see if she'd be interested in working together. Cat jumped at the suggestion and offered to sell her wedding dress on my site and donate all proceeds to charity. It was a brilliant idea and I was truly thrilled at the suggestion. While chatting with Cat, I wanted to get her take on divorce and see if she had any pearls of wisdom to pass on to other people in her position. It turns out that she did. Cat told me that she acrimoniously divorced in April 2011 and was left with next to nothing. She hit rock bottom and was forced to send her daughters to the UK to be with their father while she focused on getting back on her feet. Flash-forward to today and she's happily moved on, in love and expecting a baby!Why did you decide to sell your wedding dress? Two reasons -- first, it was the last memory I had left of the wedding and the marriage. I had no desire to see it again. Secondly, I knew that the money raised could all go to Humane Society -- the fantastic charity that rehoused our two year old Labradors sisters and do such great work. I came across neverlikeditanyway.com and loved the name and concept so much that I knew it was the perfect choice.What was the hardest part about getting divorced and how did you overcome it? I can't kid myself, all of it was hard. No particular times were any easier, but for me, the toughest part had to be the fallout. The crumbling of my perfect new family in less than two years. I had never been so low and disillusioned with life. As you get older, you are supposed to be a better judge of character, but in that department, I couldn't have failed myself more.I was foolish for thinking I was qualified to deal with issues in our marriage and I found myself in a hole so damn deep, I couldn't see any glimmer of hope! I lost my home, my family and my anonymity overnight. The day I had to put my daughters on the plane back to their father in England while I tied up the ends of our life, I walked back through the airport absolutely broken. Fans wanted pictures and I didn't even have a dollar in my pocket to buy a bottle of water; it was totally surreal. I sat in the car for hours, just crying and crying. I had definitely hit rock bottom. Divorce without any kind of settlement is hard, and being on national TV at the same time was the icing on the cake for me!I was saved ultimately by the massive support and love all around me. It's as simple as that. I also wrote in my diary, which was the best therapy of all. Releasing my thoughts and feelings on paper was so important to do to help me let go.Tell us about some of the best things that have happened since your divorce I'm free! I'm free to be me again. I found my inner confidence that I seemed to have lost along the way. I got back in touch with myself. The mind is so powerful, that I think once you let go of the sadness, disappointment, fear and all the emotions that go along with divorce, then you allow yourself to remember your dreams and aspirations. That is the most important lesson I have learned. Life is just too short to not focus on our goals of happiness and feeling complete. I was so sure I would never let anyone into my heart again, but thankfully I was wrong about that too. Now I'm the happiest and most fulfilled I have been for as long as I can remember!  What advice would you give to recent divorcees? One of the hardest things to do is to reprogram yourself -- and that takes time. For some, it takes months and for others, its years before you can stop looking back. You need to move forward and let go of that failure. I think it's really important to start trying to shed the past and get excited about your new life ahead!Start by sorting out your home and surroundings. Clear out the crap and remove the bad memories. Revamp your wardrobe. Have your hair done. Spoil yourself with a massage. Take time for you. Write down your thoughts down and goals. Make sure you get enough sleep, as a lack of it takes its toll on your emotions and rationality. Take up a new class. Get out and meet new people, but don't go out and drink too much that life feels even worse the next day! If you haven't been laid for a long time, or laid properly, then I would get that checked off your list as soon as you are ready. Don't waste hour upon hour of your newfound freedom talking about what's gone wrong and feeling sorry for yourself, because nobody else can pick you up and get you back on track but yourself. I know it's a cliché, but everything happens for a reason. There are no mistakes in life -- you just have to keep going!In my new book, Inbox Full Part II (coming soon!), I write all about how I did and didn't cope. If I could survive the hell on earth I went through and reach the other side to happiness, then anyone can!Cat's auction on Never Liked It Anyway closes on August 10th."

Demonstrate that you are an adult. If you have yet to become somewhat of an ""equal",2012-08-09,Photo of pretty woman looking at her teenage daughter during argument,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1d5126000033007f5c5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dr. LaKeasha Sullivan for YourTango.comMothers all over the world have been taking control of weddings since weddings began. Oftentimes, it is one of the last ""parenting"" roles that mothers provide. As a result, some mothers take everything a bit too far and end up hijacking the wedding planning process. Although it seems like a daunting task, there are several effective strategies for dealing with this sensitive issue. First, identify possible causes. Your mother controlling the wedding may be due to one of three problems: Either you have not been successful in asserting yourself as a fully competent adult; you have an overly close (or enmeshed) relationship with your mother; or your mother is simply providing much of the funding for this wedding, therefore she wants to control how her money is being spent.Here are the corresponding solutions:1. Demonstrate that you are an adult. If you have yet to become somewhat of an ""equal"" in your mother's eyes (within reason, of course), now is the perfect time to work on this rather confining dynamic. Essentially, your task will involve gently but firmly asserting yourself with your mother and demonstrating that you are a competent adult.Asserting yourself will take some practice and work. Demonstrating that you are a competent adult means not reverting back to child when you are interacting with your mother (easier said than done at times) and garnering her respect by making sound decisions and following through with your promises.2. Work on having a separate identity. If you have an overly close relationship with your mother, you may want to re-evaluate your relationship with her at this time. Now, no one is suggesting that you become distant with your mother. After all it's clear that you've worked hard to have a close relationship with her. However, now is the time to separate yourself from her enough so that you can have enough confidence to appropriately assert yourself with her so that you can be the one making the decisions that are important to you. 3. Pay for the wedding yourself, or suck it up. If your mother is overly involved and/or controlling because she is paying for the wedding, then you have two choices: suck it up because you need the money (try asserting yourself as well) or forego the funding so that you can have more control.If you choose to keep the money, you can engage in some self-talk surrounding keeping the wedding in perspective. If you choose to give up the strings-attached money so that you can have more control, know that this will likely upset your mother greatly, but it is a perfect opportunity to develop a more authentic relationship with her and demonstrate that you are a competent adult if you manage this conflict appropriately. Your wedding can truly be an emotional minefield! But it is also a perfect opportunity for you to build a more authentic and mature relationship with your mother.
