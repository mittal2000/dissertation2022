2,ENVIRONMENT,What Obama Said: The Optimist's Translation,"William S. Becker, Contributor
Energy & Climate Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-obama-said-the-optim_us_5bb13d83e4b09bbe9a5d09f4,"For those optimists among us who want to believe President Obama is finally ready to tackle the climate issue, it sounded as though some very important precedents might be taking shape in the White House.",2013-07-06,"CUSHING, OK - MARCH 22: U.S. President Barack Obama speaks at the southern site of the Keystone XL pipeline on March 22, 2012 in Cushing, Oklahoma. Obama is pressing federal agencies to expedite the section of the Keystone XL pipeline between Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast. (Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb13d832200003501db3f31.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ever since President Obama made his statement about the Keystone XL pipeline on June 25, editorial writers, climate-action activists and Canadian officials have been speculating about the significance of what he said. We are picking through his words like tealeaf readers.The President's staff reportedly feels that the President's statement was straightforward and that all the speculation is fascinating. But for those optimists among us who want to believe President Obama is finally ready to tackle the climate issue, it sounded as though some very important precedents might be taking shape in the White House. Here's what the President said:Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nation's interest. And our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution. The net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward. Here is what we might read between the lines: Carbon pollution is now a threshold issue. The President's criteria for Keystone focused solely on the climate problem. President Obama has often said that the national climate conversation cannot ignore jobs and the economy. But his speech wasn't about jobs or North American energy independence or our relations with our neighbor to the North. It sounded as though climate change has become the dominant concern -- a pass/fail test -- in decisions that have carbon impacts. Given the sweeping implications of climate disruption, that's exactly as it should be. The Administration is ""doing the math.' In their separate assessments of the pipeline's environmental impacts, the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency both used life-cycle costs. EPA advised State to go even farther by including the social costs of carbon in its impact assessment.That's important for three reasons. First, it demonstrates that the Administration recognizes its decisions should be based on carbon impacts far beyond the United States. Second, its assessment of carbon impacts involves not only the pipeline, but also the well-to-weather impacts of the oil it would carry. That presumably includes the carbon intensity of how the oil is extracted and processed in Canada, the carbon pollution that would be created wherever the oil is burned and the consequences of destroying part of Canada's boreal forest, one of the most important carbon sinks in the world. The third reason the Administration's methodology is important is that the social cost of carbon analysis counts things we haven't counted in the past, such as agricultural productivity, human health and property damages from the increased risks of extreme weather. The Administration's use of these analyses shows it understands that greenhouse gas emissions don't recognize borders, that anyone's pollution is everyone's problem and that carbon emissions have widespread, multifaceted consequences that must be included in benefit-cost analyses of public policy decisions. Tar sands oil is not inevitable.  The dominant ethic of the carbon age has been simple: If a resource exists, we must find a way to use it. The State Department assumed that ethic would prevail -- that if the Keystone pipeline weren't approved, Canada would find other ways to get the oil to market. Based on that assumption, State concluded that the environmental impacts of Keystone didn't count because they would occur no matter what the Administration decided.To his credit, the President gave no legitimacy to this argument. Perhaps he has concluded that no matter how Canada responds to the rejection of Keystone, the United States should not be an accessory to the production and sale of this especially carbon-intensive fuel. As the State Department finishes its analyses of Keystone's impact, it should assume that Canada's alternatives to the pipeline are by no means certain. While the President has no authority over what happens in Canada, the Canadian people do. British Columbia's recent rejection of a proposed pipeline through its territory signaled that finding options to move the oil might not be easy. In fact, the Obama Administration's rejection of Keystone could encourage more opposition to taking tar sands oil to market. The global interest is the national interest: The President's national-interest test has several dimensions, ranging from the selfish to the moral. The selfish dimension has to do with the world's ""carbon budget"" calculated by climate scientists and made famous by Bill McKibben: If we want to avoid catastrophic climate disruption, we'll have to leave 80 percent of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves in the ground.President Obama will have to figure out what the diminishing carbon budget means for his all-of-the-above energy policy and for the prospect of the United States becoming the world's leading oil producer in the next few years. What's already clear is that Canada's production of carbon-rich oil would reduce the amount of fossil energy the United States and other nations could produce within the budget. If we believe that domestic oil and gas will remain important to our economy for the foreseeable future, then helping Canada hog the carbon budget is not in our national interest.Touching on the moral dimension, the President said, ""The final part of our (climate) plan calls on America to lead -- lead international efforts to combat a changing climate. And make no mistake -- the world still looks to America to lead."" What the world is looking for is an America that has the political courage and moral authority to lead. Neither can be found in Congress, where there are more climate skeptics, deniers and sell-outs than the entire membership of the U.S. Senate. Our contemporary Congress has become the branch of government where moral leadership and political courage go to die. As Obama recognizes, leadership must come from him and his Administration. His decision on the Keystone pipeline is a highly visible and symbolic example of how he will use his executive authority. Approving the pipeline would signal business as usual in America. We'd be Canada's mule, moving its drug to market. Deciding not to permit the pipeline would show that when it comes to carbon emissions, Obama's ""all of the above"" energy policy does not mean ""anything goes."" It would show that in the interest of abating climate disruption, a ""yes we can"" President is willing to say ""no you can't,"" even to one of its allies.In sum, those of us whose hopes have been reignited that President Obama will fight the climate fight are inclined to interpret the tea leaves this way: carbon emissions are now a pass-fail test in the Administration; the Administration is doing the math made necessary by the world's carbon budget; the President intends to do what's right for the future of the global community rather than what the current Canadian government believes is right for Canada; and Obama may yet emerge as a leader for the Anthropocene era. Maybe the Keystone project will force our political leaders to confront questions we should have confronted long ago. What are the limits of sovereignty in the age of climate change? What legal and moral obligations do nations have to protect the atmospheric commons for future generations? How should those obligations be enforced? When should carbon-cutting trump free trade? When will industrialized nations accept that whatever remains of the carbon budget, developing countries deserve most of it? When will the American people elect a Congress that believes ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" are intergenerational rights, not the privileges of one generation at the expense of those to come? The White House staff may believe we're over thinking the speech, and it's probably correct. Nevertheless, it's tempting to conclude that President Obama understands that finding answers to questions like these will be the most important part of his legacy, and time is running out."

(photo by Sarah Baker)It's strange, because there in the sun, just a few hundred feet from where the decisions were being read, we actually found out quite a bit later than many of you at home reading SCOTUSblog. Phone service was sparse and in the bright, direct sunlight, I couldn't see a thing on my screen. Not to mention, I was busy hosting streaming coverage and interviews for WeActRadio. While talking with Congressman Mark Takano (D-CA), the decision striking down Section 3 of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) came out.I wanted to scream and hug the Congress member, but we didn't quite have that kind of relationship yet. I continued covering the day's events and followed up with several other interviews on radio stations around the country and finished up the day on SiriusXM Radio with my husband and another friend and her wife... and a bottle of champagne. What a day!My husband Sean and I had helped to organize rallies that happened outside the Supreme Court back in March while the DOMA and Prop 8 arguments were being heard. So much of our time was spent considering what ""the other side"" would be planning while we rallied. Partly we wanted to know so that we could respond courteously and effectively to the things they said. But the other reason we wanted to be prepared for them was so we could protect the families we knew would be standing with us, from the hateful, toxic things the anti-gay right seems to spew when they're angry. Our kids don't need to hear that.Last week in front of the court was different though. Despite hate groups like the National Organization for Marriage and Family Research Council calling for ""days of prayer"" and for their followers to stand with them that morning on the steps of the court, no one came. I could count on one hand the number of people standing their with anti-gay signs. The rest was a sea of rainbows and love. Maybe despite their screams to the press that they would win, they knew what was coming, what was inevitable.What followed that amazing day when my husband and I woke up without equality and went to bed with 1,100 more rights, was truly dumbfounding.The National Organization immediately began attacking the court for making an ""Illegitimate"" decision. In their first email/blog post, they asked for money and linked to their fundraising page 8 TIMES. As a person who works in digital media for a living, I can tell you with some certainty that 3-4 times is excessive when asking for money in one email, but 8?!? Not even street canvassers will bother you that many times.NOM President Brian Brown's initial response to the court's decision was scathing:""There is a stench coming from this case that has now stained the Supreme Court. They've allowed corrupt politicians and judges to betray the voters, rewarding them for their betrayal. It's an illegitimate decision. We and millions of other Americans will refuse to accept this rogue decision rewarding corruption. ""Then came the emails. The angry, angry emails. NOM's emails accused California lawmakers of participating in ""lawlessness"" when they began issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples (which was now legal following Prop 8 being struck down). Another email was filled with vitriol and borderline racist comments about CA Attorney General Kamala Harris. In this message, they refer to Harris' ""arrogance,"" a term usually reserved for those we think don't deserve a place in leadership. Additionally, they use the email to twist and misquote remarks made by the President about Harris a few months ago.They followed with a tweet that said ""Polygamists are actually celebrating the Supreme Court's decisions this week as a personal victory for them"" and linked to a blog post which of course, said nothing of the sort.In other posts, they continued their usual outdated theme claiming that marriage equality is bad for children somehow. Yet they continue to ignore the fact that their argument completely discounts the millions of kids being raised by LGBT parents.NOM wrapped up the week with a patriotic 4th of July email claiming that a person cannot be gay or a supporter of equality for gay people and an American at the same time. Graphic from NOM's most recent emailThe anti-gay Right is disintegrating before our eyes and the desperation with which they are clinging onto life has never been more apparent. They will never be gone forever, though. Just as we've seen with groups that fought integration and some in the South who are still fighting the Civil War, they're never gone for good.Happily though, with support for marriage equality in this country hitting all time highs and a Gallup poll following last week's rulings finding support at 55 percent for and 40 percent against legalizing same-sex marriages, these hate groups will continue to lose funding and support.The fight is far from over, and as NOM is only too quick to recognize, there are still 37 states which do not recognize marriage equality. I think this number will drop quickly, but not without our work."

The disturbances began on the night of June 28, 1969 as a protest by gays against police harassment and helped trigger the modern US gay rights movement. AFP PHOTO/Stan Honda (Photo credit should read STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb7d83c000066000b9b7c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Martin Luther King, Jr., famously observed, ""The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards Justice."" The American civil rights movement has made slow progress since May 17, 1954, when the Supreme Court struck down the ""separate but equal doctrine"" in  Brown vs. Board of Education. Nonetheless, few anticipated the rapidity of acceptance of same-sex marriage.The American civil rights era began on Dec. 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks launched the Montgomery Bus Boycott by refusing to give up her seat to a white man. As the African-American civil rights campaign began to produce results, it was joined by the women's liberation movement, the campaign for Hispanic-American civil rights, and the gay pride movement.The first many of us heard of what came to be termed the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) rights movement was the Stonewall Inn riots that began on June 28, 1969. There were similar incidents in isolated parts of the U.S., but for most progressives the LGBT concerns seemed a tiny part of the total civil-rights movement. We thought we didn't know homosexuals.In 1971 I was attending a service at the San Francisco Unitarian church when the minister invited a LGBT advocate to discuss their concerns. He made three points: Gays were coming out of the closet. They were our friends and family members. And they demanded to be treated as equals, to have rights equal to straights.Within several years, I realized that I knew gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. Some I had suspected but many came as a surprise. Having them come out didn't change our relationship but it did make me aware of their concerns and the barriers they encountered that didn't impact me, a straight white man.The larger community slowly began to change. On Dec. 15, 1973, the American Psychiatric Association voted to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. On Nov. 8, 1977, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. (One year late he was assassinated.)In 1980 the Democratic Party declared that it would not discriminate against homosexuals and worked LGBT rights into the Democratic platform. In 1981 famous tennis player, Billy Jean King, came out as a lesbian. In 1982 Americans became aware that many of our friends were suffering from HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). In 1983 movie star Rock Hudson died of AIDS. In 1986 a lesbian couple was allowed to adopt a child. In 1987 Congressman Barney Frank came out as gay.In 1992 the World Health Organization declared that homosexuality was not an illness -- the AMA agreed in 1994. In 1993 musician Melissa Etheridge came out as a lesbian. In 1998 Tammy Baldwin became the first open lesbian elected to the House of Representatives. In 1999 California passed a civil union/registered partner law.By 2003 most states had passed laws banning LGBT discrimination. In 2003 the Supreme Court struck down Sodomy laws (Lawrence vs. Texas). In 2004 the battleground became same-sex marriage when San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsome permitted same-sex couples to obtain marriage licenses. However these marriages were annulled. In 2008, The California Supreme Court again granted same-sex couples the right to marry. My wife and I held a reception to celebrate the weddings of several of our lesbian friends. Nonetheless, in November of 2008 Californians narrowly approved a ballot initiative -- Proposition 8 -- that once again banned same-sex marriage. The battle moved into the court system.In 2011 the US Military ended the ban on openly LGBT service personnel. In 2012 President Barack Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage and Tammy Baldwin became the first open lesbian elected to the US Senate. On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled against the ""Defense of Marriage Act"" and let California's Proposition 8 be struck down. (13 states have legalized same-sex marriage.)Looking back on the 44 years since the Stonewall Inn riots, it's clear enormous progress has been made affirming LGBT rights. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Americans have come out of the closet and in many places been allowed to live normal lives. It's a tribute to the leadership of the LGBT movement that so much has been accomplished in such a (relatively) short amount of time.Nonetheless, there is much work to be done. Thirty-five states have banned same-sex marriage and many of these treat LGBT individuals as pariahs.Indeed, the civil rights movement in general has more work to do. The same Supreme Court session that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act also eviscerated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And it's clear that many of the states that continue to discriminate against LGBT individuals also look down upon women, African- and Hispanic-Americans.Each of the ""identity"" groups has their unique challenges: for women it's access to comprehensive healthcare; for the LGBT caucus it's marriage equality; for Hispanics it's immigration; and for blacks it's access to the ballot box. But, as Washington Post columnist Harold Meyerson notes, what cuts across all these groups is economic inequality. The United States is now more accepting of the LGBT community than it was 44 years ago, and more accepting of women, blacks, and Hispanics. But we are less accepting of the poor. In that sense the arc of the moral universe has not bent towards justice."
