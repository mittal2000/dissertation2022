1,WELLNESS,Opinion Stew,"David L. Katz, M.D., M.P.H., Contributor
Founder, True Health Initiative",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nutrition-advice_us_5b9d08c4e4b03a1dcc83eb6a,"We have created a seething stew of opinion about everything to do with nutrition, including, presumably, stew.  That leaves us with far too many cooks, many lacking credentials to be in the kitchen in the first place.",2013-04-12,"UNITED STATES - MARCH 16: A customer in a New York book store walks past a wall of diet books, March 16, 2006. The low-carbohydrate Atkins diet, which experienced a peak of popularity two years ago, isn't safe and shouldn't be recommended for weight loss, according to doctors writing in The Lancet. (Photo by Adam Rountree/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d08c42200008300d9785b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everyone has opinions. You probably know what they say about that. But leaving aside the olfactory qualities of all the opinions to which we are entitled, we at least tend to know when our opinions are just opinions. But not with nutrition*, where not only does everyone have an opinion, but everyone seems to think theirs is an expert opinion. And our culture seems to be okay with that. I'm not. By the same token, I'm not convinced that someone who happens to live through a bad car crash to drive again is automatically qualified to take over NHTSA, or set up shop as a motor vehicle safety expert, and dispense advice accordingly. Call me crazy.I am not at all sure that someone who inadvertently sets fire to his kitchen, and manages to put out the fire before burning everything entirely down, is a shoe-in as fire commissioner, or qualifies as a fire safety expert. I am not sure that he should go on to establish a cottage industry in fire safety, selling expert advice in books, blogs, and programs.I would have my doubts if someone who has driven for 10 years without ever having an airbag deploy writes a book, starts an organization and launches a social movement to oppose airbags as a government conspiracy. She might be convinced that airbags are a ploy by the ""Big Auto"" industry to dupe the public and drive up prices, but that wouldn't make it so. I'm not entirely persuaded that someone who happens to have gone hiking in Alaska once without being eaten by a bear is de facto a leading authority on bears, and qualified to dispense expert guidance on how to handle them.I don't think someone who has been a passenger on a plane is automatically a credible source about how to fly one. I don't think anyone who has driven over a suspension bridge necessarily knows how best to build one. I don't think someone treated once by a neurosurgeon gets to offer expert commentary on the nuances of brain surgery.I trust these examples all seem pretty silly. We would never allow for claims of expertise, and cottage industries based on them, to be established on such flighty nonsense.Unless, of course, the claims of expertise and cottage industries pertained to nutrition and weight loss -- in which case, that's exactly what we would do. It's exactly what we are doing.Everyone who has ever gotten fat and then lost weight is embraced as an expert, fully authorized by our culture to dispense advice and sell books advising others on how to succeed. For the most part, every one of these makes a case different from every other -- and yet every one is convinced they have found the universal formula. And over and over again, the faithful, or hopeful, line up and reach for their credit cards.Don't get me wrong -- I am delighted for very individual who figures out how to lose weight, and more importantly, find health. I am delighted each time someone finds a path they can follow to lasting vitality. But the notion that this automatically registers as expertise is exactly analogous to the car crash and kitchen fire examples above. In any area other than nutrition and weight control, we would either laugh or roll our eyes.Everyone who has ever eaten seems to be granted an equally authoritative opinion about nutrition.This is not just nonsense. It's dangerous nonsense.I am not arguing that nutrition is special and should be treated differently simply because it is one of the most profound influences on human health (it is). I am not arguing that nutrition should be treated with particular respect because it makes the list of top three causes of premature death and chronic disease, and can exert a positive influence just as great (it does). I am not suggesting that nutrition should be shown unique deference because it represents the construction material for the growing bodies of children and grandchildren we love.Quite the contrary; I am saying we need to stop treating nutrition differently. We simply need to treat it as we do any other subject that matters, and a whole lot of harm and confusion would go away. We need to stop treating nutrition with unique disdain. What harm ensues from that disdain? Every silly diet to come down the pike gets the same treatment. I know this, because I do multiple media interviews every week about whatever the fad diet du jour happens to be (the latest theme is intermittent fasting, by the way). These diets are then featured on television and in print in a way that gives them all comparable credibility. And we are all kept in a state of perpetual confusion about what's what.The result? We already have far too many silly diets than any one of us could try in a lifetime, and we just keep getting fatter and sicker all the while. Competing versions of dogma are a catalyst for nothing but dissent and quagmire.The recurrent promise of magic from sources given credibility they don't deserve forestalls the unified, culture-wide commitment to eating well and being active that really could add years to our lives, and life to our years. And yes -- we really do know what eating well means. We are not by any means clueless about the basic care and feeding of Homo sapiens, and how bizarre it would be if we were! Our knowledge of optimal nutrition is by no means perfect, but it is genuine knowledge -- and there is no need to make perfect the enemy of good.Admittedly, there are differences of opinion among even legitimate experts in nutrition. To some extent, this is the inevitable parsing of details that occurs among experts in any field; it's about the icing, not the cake. To some extent, this is a byproduct of our incomplete and evolving knowledge of nutrition and health. But I do believe it is compounded by our tendency to treat any opinion on nutrition as an expert opinion. To get noticed at all in such context, some otherwise legitimate experts wind up exaggerating their perspectives to the point of disfigurement. I see this as the very unfortunate result of collusion among a culture that fails to require true expertise as a basis for expert opinion; a news media that profits from the perpetual uncertainty of their audience, and thus their receptivity to the next false promise; and experts willing to do whatever it takes to be heard above this din. Alas.All it would take to fix this stultifying mess is to treat nutrition and weight management like every other legitimate field of inquiry. With no more respect than all the others, but no less either.We don't care what people not trained to do neurosurgery think about neurosurgical technique. They are not qualified to opine. When it comes to building airplanes or suspension bridges, we want to hear from the right kinds of highly-trained engineers, not some character who happened to ride in a plane once, or drive across a bridge. When it comes to flying those planes, we want things in the hands of trained pilots -- not some guy with a lot of frequent-flyer miles and strong convictions. And I'm confident we want special military operations delegated to our elite troops, and not someone who saw Zero Dark Thirty and came out convinced he could have done a better job.For now, anyone who shares opinions about nutrition or weight loudly and often enough -- or cleverly enough -- is embraced as an authority, with no one generally even asking what if any training they've had. This is compounded by the fact that, in the famous words of Bertrand Russell, ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts."" It is the least substantiated, most uninformed opinions about how to eat that will come at you with the greatest conviction. That's your first clue that something is awry, because true expertise always allows for doubt.We have created a seething stew of opinion about everything to do with nutrition, including, presumably, stew. That leaves us with far too many cooks, many lacking credentials to be in the kitchen in the first place. I trust everyone knows what that means.-fin*I am by no means suggesting readers buy this textbook! Rather, I cite it simply to show I've done my homework.

3,WELLNESS,The Anatomy of Hope,"Roberta Gately, Contributor

And with a little effort, and a practiced approach, we can find our way past our own stumbling blocks and make our way to the possibilities that hope offers.",2013-04-12,"Highway sign illustrating the concept of 'Hope is just around the corner,' or 'this way for Hope'",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d07da2100003300c55b4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What exactly is it, that little kernel, that tiny bud of something, that allows people who possess it to move beyond the immediacy of their troubles and to focus instead on the barely discernible sparkle of light, the promise that misery is only fleeting and that better days lay just ahead? Surely that tiny bubble of optimism lives in each of us, and for some, it seems an easy task to summon up the courage to focus on the light. But for others, the quicksand of misfortune and disappointment is all-encompassing, a suffocating handicap on the road to happiness. In many ways, the acquiescence to hopelessness is the lazy man's route. No effort is required to let inertia overtake you, to let yourself be mired in melancholy, to feel first your shoulders and then your heart and finally your dreams slump and fade away. But there are no rewards to hopelessness, no rainbows, no wishes fulfilled. Without hope, we are no more than cogs in a spinning wheel. But with it, we are the wind that makes the wheel turn.So how do we tap into our fountain of optimism and hope? Just how do some of us see through the pain of a broken heart or an endless wad of worries to the possibilities that lay just ahead? On those days when nothing seems possible, we have to believe in ourselves and ultimately in the temporary nature of our discontent. And with a little effort, and a practiced approach, we can find our way past our own stumbling blocks and make our way to the possibilities that hope offers.How do we conceive and imagine and finally grasp the positive outcome? The first step goes beyond believing in our own worthiness, although we surely must believe in that. Finding hope is finding the confidence to know with absolute certainty that there is light at the end of our tunnels, and that light will guide us through whatever storms we face. To move forward, believe in yourself, in your innate goodness, and allow yourself to be open to the world's possibilities. Know too that your trials are transient, a tiny blip on the screen that is your life.Once you've imagined the hope-filled outcomes, open your eyes and your heart to the potential and promise we all too often miss as we struggle to just get by -- the singular beauty of a perfect sunrise, the sound of children's laughter, the sudden twinkle of an evening star -- and know too that the universe wants you to sparkle as brightly as that star, to laugh as raucously as that child and to glow as brilliantly as that sunrise.We've all seen the examples of hope at its best -- the patient who despite the odds and the devastating prognosis, outlives his terminal cancer, the stroke victim who learns to speak again, the heartbroken woman who finds the love of her life. The common denominator is hope, that ability to believe in the power of your own wishes and dreams and imagination, and to know that whatever trial you face, hope is, if not the cure, then the first antidote to what ails you.Everything that we do or touch is impacted by hope. It puts the smile on your face, the spring in your step, the dream in your heart. Without it we are left to our own often insubstantial devices, but with it, we are able to rise above and see beyond the minutiae and melancholy that might otherwise define us. Hope is not an elusive or intangible quality as so many academics would have us believe. It is our own reality at its very best, and it exists in each of us. Find yours, exercise it daily, imagine, dream and then take the necessary steps -- baby steps to be sure at first, to finding your bliss and creating your new reality.For more on happiness, click here.For more by Roberta Gately, click here.

6,TRAVEL,$3 Million Treasure Still Waiting To Be Found,"Margie Goldsmith, Contributor
Has traveled to 130 countries and written about them all",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-million-treasure-still_us_5b9d02a1e4b03a1dcc83c143,Forrest Fenn an almost 82-year-old millionaire art collector and former Santa Fe gallery owner hid a treasure worth $3 million (though it might be worth more now) and the treasure is still out there waiting to be found.,2013-04-11,"a staghorn cholla cactus is silhouetted against the bright burning golden yellow sun turning the landscape intense reds and oranges underneath a cloud filled sky. such beautiful nature scenery can be found in the sandia mountains of albuquerque, new mexico. square composition.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d02a12100003300c559b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," The 42-pound treasure chest that Forrest Fenn hidForrest Fenn an almost 82-year-old millionaire art collector and former Santa Fe gallery owner hid a treasure worth $3 million (though it might be worth more now) and the treasure is still out there waiting to be found. The story, reported recently on both The Today Show and on NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams, has gone viral and has created a run on Fenn's book, The Thrill of the Chase (with nine clues to the treasure). The Thrill of the Chase, is now one of the bestselling books in America and reached number 15 on Amazon's Top 100 List. It is selling on ebay for $500. The book started selling at four per minute and rapidly went out of print. (There have now been a third printing of 7,700 copies and a fourth of 7,700 ten days later). Fenn is not making anything from the book -- he has donated them all to Collected Works bookstore.Over spring break, 6,000 people came into Santa Fe to treasure hunt. No wonder. The treasure includes 265 gold coins, hundreds of gold nuggets, some weighing more than a troy pound each, prehistoric gold fetishes, a 2000 year old necklace made of carved quartz crystals and other semi-precious stones, hundreds of rubies, diamonds, emeralds, two Ceylon sapphires, and two ancient Chinese carved jade figures. (There are 20.2 troy pounds of gold in the chest and the price varies every hour. Some of the coins have numismatic value beyond the value of spot gold). The treasure chest also includes a 20,000 word autobiography in a glass jar, protected from the elements and printed so small that a magnifying glass is needed to read it.Why did he hide a treasure? Diagnosed with cancer and losing a kidney in 1988, Fenn was given a 20 percent chance of living three years so he decided that if he had to go, he would just take it with him.The cancer went into remission, but Fenn went ahead and hid the treasure somewhere in the mountains north of Santa Fe.  Forrest Fenn in Santa Fe (photo by: Margie Goldsmith)The chase was on and thousands emailed Forest Fenn searching for additional clues. One searcher got lost and ended up spending the night in Bandolier National Park (she was rescued the next day). But the world is full of naysayers and Fenn is being accused of being irresponsible -- as if it were his fault a seeker was lost or that someone dug a hole in a national park. This is his response to the criticism:This is going to get me in trouble but I have to say it. The following words have nothing to do with the treasure chest I hid, and they will give no hints or associations to its location.  Searching for hidden treasures in the mountains is enjoyable. It brings families together, it promotes bonding and it gets kids off the streets, out of the game rooms and away from their texting machines. During rough economic times, it provides hopes and dreams where otherwise they might be lacking. It is both healthy and mind expanding. And it utilizes the great outside for the purpose it was intended. I have 14,442 emails that have told me those things.  I am sorry that someone was arrested for digging a small hole in the ground. In the scope of world events, surely it should not have made the front page and NBC news. It is beyond me why anyone would want to prosecute that man. If I were his judge, I would fine him ten bucks and tell him not to do it again. What has happened to our basic senses? There are those who will tell me that I do not understand the problem, and they will be right, I don't.  Let us put things in perspective and look at them from a different slant. There are 654,885,389 acres of land in the United States that are owned by the American people. That is what the federal government admits is ""public property."" And the population of this great country is 313,914,040. After doing the math I learn that my allotment is exactly 2.086 acres.  Now, what if I wanted to secret a can of Dr. Pepper under a rock in the cooling waters of a rivulet somewhere in my allotted public acreage? If I did, I would not need to use all of my area, I would need just 7.5 fluid ounces and 90 calories of space. And I would still have about 2.08555 acres remaining. Seems fair to me but would I have broken the law? Yes or No? If yes, then let us change the law because who knows where that nonsense could end. If no, then why are we getting so excited about the little things?"

The 7-year-old Barron uses Melania's Caviar Complex C6 moisturizer every night after his bath. ""It smells very, very fresh,"" Melania, who launched the skincare line exclusively in Lord & Taylor this week, told ABC News. ""I put it on him from head to toe.

She imports the caviar from a cultured sturgeon farm in the South of France, where it is harvested at optimal ripeness to maintain the nutrients, according to a press release. It might come as no surprise that the Slovenian beauty is eager to pamper her boy. Barron is her only son and Donald's youngest. She gave birth to him in 2006, one year after marrying Donald. Melania has said being a mother is her top priority. ""I am a full time mom; that is my first job,"" she told Parenting magazine in September. ""The most important job ever. I started my business when he started school. When he is in school I do my meetings, my sketches, and everything else. I cook him breakfast. Bring him to school. Pick him up. Prepare his lunch. I spend the afternoon with him."" But she also allows for some flexibility in her parenting philosophy. ""I don’t push my thoughts or likes or dislikes. I want him to grow to be his own person. I think is important to give a child room to make mistakes in order to learn,"" she said. ""Mistakes build wings so later in life they can fly and go on their own. Let them fall once in awhile ... Be their friend and parent as well. When they’re in trouble they will come to you first. Don’t try to change their opinion."" The Donald himself even has a list of tips on how to ""raise kick ass kids"". One of his pearls of parenting wisdom: Let them know they are exceptional, so exceptional results are expected. "

I polled a wide swath of family, friends, acquaintances, and co-workers to come up with these 10 secret spots.1. Bottom Shelf of the Refrigerator: This might not sound like a hiding place at first, but it's got all the right qualities: it's dark and not easily visible unless you bend way over or get down on one knee, which is much more effort than most people exert when looking in the fridge for something to eat. My vice is chocolate -- bittersweet bars, brownies, and chocolate chip cookies -- and that's where I stash it. Unfortunately for me, chocolate also happens to be a favorite of my husband and daughters. When our girls were tots, I hid my hoard in the freezer out of their reach. That worked until my husband found the goodies. So I switched to the very back of the bottom shelf of the fridge because, let's face it, who besides mom sticks her hand back there?2. Cleaning Supplies Cabinet: It holds the same level of attraction as the bottom shelf of the fridge, but the food had better be well sealed. ""I have to hide food all the time from my husband,"" wrote a colleague. ""The cleaning supplies cabinet is a place he's sure never to look.""3. Dishwasher: Several pals swear by the dishwasher. The males in their households don't make use of that appliance. A mum with several sons thought she was getting away with it until one child happened to open the dishwasher and found a box of cookies there. He whispered worriedly to his father, ""I think Mum is going crazy. She put cookies in the dishwasher!""4. Empty Bran Flakes Boxes: If you're a kid, bran flakes are totally out of the question when you come home from school, ravenous for a snack. That's what one mother figured, and she's been happily sneaking cookies from those boxes for years.5. Trompe L'Oeil Book Boxes: Talk about hiding in plain sight! A friend married to an art collector keeps a couple of antique-looking books on her night table. Open them up, and they're perfect hiding places. Note the chocolate stashed in the open box at the right. The book boxes actually arrived as a gift filled with handmade chocolate bonbons. The art collector has yet to inquire why he never sees her reading the books! 6. Empty Shampoo Bottles: A former camp counselor reported that she was ordered to do random candy searches in the bunkhouse she shared with a gaggle of 13-year olds, and discovered just how creative the kids could be. A rattling shampoo bottle hid a mother lode of M&M's. Of course the counselor had to sample them to make sure the camper hadn't been poisoning herself with shampoo!7. Mattress Covers: It turns out that campers are a rich source of ideas for hiding places. The aforementioned camp counselor also found candy tucked away between the mattress and zipped-on mattress cover. Need a sugar fix? Just unzip your mattress cover!8. Kleenex Box: The mother of a camper was reminded by her daughter that the mother herself made sure to stuff Skittles underneath the tissues in a Kleenex box packed in the top of the duffle. When the camper unpacked, she transferred the candy to the front pouch of a folded sweatshirt into which she dipped daily until, oops, the ants found it, too. 9. Underneath Garden Dirt: A very resourceful mother hid packets of M&M's in strategic spots under rocks and dirt in the garden as an incentive for this colleague and, he suspects, for his mother as well, to keep them both on track with gardening projects when he was younger.10. The Snow Boot Chest: Another friend's grandmother kept freshly made Christmas cookies in tins she stuffed in what he described as the ""weird snow boot chest"" in the pantry. She did such a good job of hiding them that they often weren't found until she was spring-cleaning for Easter. Despite being a tad stale, her grandchildren devoured them.Other Priceless Reactions: One colleague admitted she used to hide food, but then forgot where she hid it, so she gave up on that idea. Another colleague said, ""I wish I could say that I actually devour my treats slowly enough to hide them anywhere but for the most part I just eat them. All. At once.""Where do you hide your foodie booty?More from Epicurious:5 Common Recipe Mistakes Best Burger Recipes Make a Better Roast Chicken Easy Family Dinners 25 Sandwich Makeovers How to Eat Your Spring Veggies"

April is turning out to be the cruelest month in a while for sniffles and scratchy throats here in the office. No serious suffering, mind you, just low-grade discomfort, and perhaps worse in a bevy of food editors, the woolly deadening of the palate.I have yet to find a chicken soup I truly love (so much for my soul). And having missed my annual ritual dram of Irish Coffee last month, I'm seriously considering compensating with a double Hot Toddy tonight. But first I'm going to take a tip from my colleagues, who kindly shared their time-tested cold remedies and personal picks for health-promoting foods:Honey and more honey: ""I believe pretty strongly in the power of raw local honey to fight colds. I can only speak anecdotally, of course, but it usually works for me,"" Lauren Salkeld advises. Kerry Acker and Esther Sung echo the benefits of the sweet amber stuff, especially in Ginger Tea--laced with loads of lemon juice chez Acker.Ginger: Speaking of ginger, Siobhan Adcock relies on drinking ""a good amount of ginger ale on ice.... The fizziness and the ginger soothe my stomach, the coolness feels good on a scratchy throat, and there's just enough sugar to give me a little energy boost without the crash or the dehydrating effects of caffeine.""Spicy soups and sauce: ""For me, a bowl of pasta with a lot of garlicky tomato sauce--and, if I can stomach it, hot red pepper--seems to fix me up,"" says editorial production manager Michele Zotos. ""I'm not sure if the ingredients have to do with it, or that it's something my mom would have cooked and I feel psychologically nurtured. If I'm badly congested and have a bad cough, I have miso soup and sushi with a lot of wasabi or whatever they are using that poses as wasabi, as long as it's hot."" Acker concurs: ""I'm all about hot and spicy soups, especially pho.""Tincture tip: ""I swear by Quantum Cold & Flu tincture. I keep a bottle on me at all times,"" confides ""Ask Kemp"" Minifie. ""The minute I notice the slightest tickle in my throat, a sneeze, or if I'm feeling particularly cold, I take it. I think it's telling that my daughters swear by it, too..... Some people find it too unpleasant a taste, but I've come to like it. You put two or three eyedroppers full of the stuff in a glass of water and drink it down.""Armed with all these suggestions, I think I'm feeling better--and hungrier--already. Ginger, honey, lemon, garlic, and hot peppers are all appealing ingredients.

Since the drama's inception on AMC, Michael Kors has cited Mad Men as a runway inspiration, Prada has taken a sartorial cue from the series, and the Tennessee-raised designer has collaborated on three collections with Banana Republic, making Sterling Cooper's vintage office-wear accessible to contemporary consumers.In anticipation of the show's sixth season VF.com phoned Bryant earlier this week to discuss the many character transformations that the Emmy winner has assisted with her indelible costumes.Julie Miller: Matthew Weiner is notoriously tight-lipped about upcoming seasons of Mad Men. At what point does he tell you what will be happening during the season so that you can start preparing?Janie Bryant: What happens is I usually get a five- or six-week period for prep time, and that's when I start doing the costume designs. During that time, I have my creative discussions with Matt, and we talk about what's going to happen for the upcoming season. At that point, I'll know the time line, sort of. [Laughs.] It's an ongoing process, but at the beginning, that's where I start doing my research for whatever year it is. I'll start by watching old movies of the period. I do a lot of research. I have a lot of costume- history books. I look at a lot of catalogues, like Montgomery Ward, Sears, and J.C. Penney, that are really about everyday living during that period. That is really important, because Mad Men is about portraying the lives of all of these different characters. It is not about a cat walk or trends of the 1960s. . . . It's about developing characters through costume design that are real and natural to those specific people.Some characters do experiment with trends, as we saw last season with Megan and Harry, for example. As the trends of the era approach more synthetic and Lurex, how do you toe the line of acknowledging the time period's styles without veering into cheesy territory?For me, it's always by being inspired by the script and being really inspired by the characters. It's so much about the mood of Mad Men as well. I always think of it as being very sophisticated and extremely intelligent. The tone can be dark and a little humorous. It's never cheesy. I always keep that in mind for the costume design.What's the most difficult aspect of designing for the show?For me, it's always about going from season to season and gently moving forward. And making sure that the seasons are tied together, but to show that time has passed as well. That always seems to be the biggest challenge. Going back to real life, it's understanding that in our real life we know that the styles and the trends may change. Not all of us keep up with them. And not all of the trends may be best for our figure. There are certain characters that have changed. Megan is a character that could definitely change her style, between being an actress and leaving the office. There were all of these different roles for her to play. She was Don's new wife and had a whole new income from that. She was able to afford very stylish clothing (left). So that was fun, to think about how her character could really change and grow.Harry is another character who has really changed throughout all five seasons. I was just looking at some of Harry's Season One and Season Two costumes. To look at him in Season Five and to see how his character has changed and grown from this newbie, insecure guy at the agency with the nerdy glasses and bow ties to . . . if there's one character that is kind of cheesy and douchey [now], it's Harry. In Season Five, we see him as Mr. Hollywood, getting into that modern style for men's wear.Read the rest of the interview here!More from Vanity Fair:25 Years in the Life of Model Kate MossLady Gaga, Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston: Vanity Fair's Classic Nude PortraitsRed-Carpet Looks: Modern vs. Classic Hollywood Styles Kissing Celebs: Candid Moments from 2013 "

The restaurant, long a standby of mall food courts and cafeterias, has moved to rebrand its image with a sleeker new look and a revamped menu shifted toward ""taste, quality, health, and sustainability,"" Panda Express Chief Marketing Officer Glenn Lunde told Bloomberg Businessweek.This week, one of those changes takes effect: Fried rice across the chain's 1,500-plus locations will be made with brown rice instead of long-grain white rice. The switch up is healthier, the chain says.But is it? ""If you add fiber to a candy bar -- it's still a candy bar,"" registered dietician and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson Bethany Thayer told The Huffington Post. ""You've got a whole grain, which is great,"" she allowed, but frying it up defeats the purpose of eating healthier.Panda Express did not return calls to comment on the switch to brown rice. In theory, the new grain is healthier than white rice. ""Brown rice does have more fiber than white rice,"" Thayer explained. ""It also has more of ... other nutrients like magnesium, zinc and iron, and other micronutrients.""According to Panda Express's website, one serving of fried rice packs 19g of fat and 830mg of sodium. In contrast, plain, white rice (not fried) -- another side option at Panda Express -- doesn't contain fat or sodium, according to nutrition facts on the chain's website.Based on a 2,000-calorie diet, the FDA recommends that people consume no more than 65 grams of fat a day and 2,400 mg of sodium; one serving of Panda Express fried rice accounts for 30 percent of an individual's daily fat allowance and nearly 35 percent of his or her sodium allowance. These numbers are especially striking considering that the fried rice is marketed as a side dish.Plain white rice is a healthier choice than fried brown rice, Thayer said, but she worries that consumers won't pick up on this subtlety. ""I do think that we need to be careful of the 'health halos' that sometimes end up on foods,"" she warned. They ""can sometimes lead people to think, 'Oh, I can have as much of this as I want.'""But, Thayer conceded, the substitution of brown rice for white would benefit those who would have ordered fried rice regardless. The ""stealth approach,"" as Thayer described it, has the potential to impact consumers without them ever realizing it. Indeed, Panda Express's Lunde told Bloomberg Businessweek that fried rice made with white rice is, in fact, brown -- so the side dish's ""new"" appearance shouldn't startle consumers.""It's healthier, and they don't even know it,"" Thayer mused."
