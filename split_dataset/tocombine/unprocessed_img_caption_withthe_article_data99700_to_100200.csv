6,BUSINESS,Corporate Violence as Crime: Anniversary of the West Virginia Chemical Spill,"Rena Steinzor, ContributorProfessor, University of Maryland School of Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corporate-violence-as-cri_b_6437950.html,"Under American law, criminal prosecutions serve dual, mutually reinforcing purposes: they both punish and deter. Yet until recently, prosecutors have been excessively cautious about defining routine industrial behavior as a guilty act that triggers criminal culpability.",2015-01-12,"In this Jan. 13, 2014, photo, workers, left, inspect an area outside a retaining wall around storage tanks where a chemical leaked into the Elk River at Freedom Industries storage facility in Charleston, W.Va. The chemical spill that contaminated water for hundreds of thousands of West Virginians is just the latest and most high-profile case of coal polluting the nationâs waters. An Associated Press analysis of federal environmental data found chemicals and waste from the coal industry have tainted hundreds of waterways and groundwater supplies for decades, spoiling private wells, shutting down fishing and rendering streams virtually lifeless. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3191a24000031009740b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A year ago, about 300,000 people in and around Charleston, West Virginia, lost their drinking water source when thousands of gallons of a toxic chemical known as MCHM (4-methylcyclohexanemethanol) leaked into the nearby Elk River through a hole in a rusted-out storage tank. Last month, the wheels of justice began to catch up with the owners of the responsible company when they were indicted by U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin. Coincidentally, the West Virginia indictments came down on the same day that the Justice Department charged 14 people in Massachusetts for their role in producing and distributing meningitis-tainted steroid injections that killed 64 people.The same-day indictments framed a question business leaders would do well to contemplate: When do corporations and their executives cross the line between unavoidable human error and preventable criminal misconduct? Prosecutors seem increasingly ready to push reckless management to the criminal side of the line as one corporate fiasco after another claims lives and causes hugely expensive damage to communities and local economies.Under American law, criminal prosecutions serve dual, mutually reinforcing purposes: they both punish and deter. Yet until recently, prosecutors have been excessively cautious about defining routine industrial behavior as a guilty act that triggers criminal culpability. Defense lawyers work hard to preserve this status quo, arguing that drugs are contaminated inadvertently, chemical spills are unavoidable, and in cases of deadly but preventable defects in automobiles, cars sometimes don't work. In other words, the high living standards we enjoy in the developed world depend on the occasional disaster.Increasingly, such arguments fall on deaf ears among those sworn to prosecute criminal violations. In the past few years, federal prosecutors in five states have indicted corporations and their executives for particularly abhorrent practices. In Georgia, the owners and operators of a plant that shipped peanut paste that tested positive for salmonella, taking nine lives, were convicted of felonies. In West Virginia, Don Blankenship, known as the ""dark lord of coal country,"" awaits trial after he allegedly threatened to fire supervisors who tried to comply with safety standards and the violations caused a mine explosion that killed 29.These cases share similar management practices at their core: relentless cost-cutting, gross neglect of maintenance, systematic erosion of safety culture, and an obsession with doing work too quickly to save money. Senior executives consciously ignore warnings that safety failures are rampant. The pharmacy that made the steroid injections operated a supposedly sterile clean room, but shut down the air conditioner at night to save on electricity costs, allowing fungi and bacteria to grow. When employees complained about unsanitary conditions, managers said, ""This line is worth more than all your lives combined, so don't stop it."" (That's an actual quote!)Even after the resulting catastrophe -- the worst prescription drug tragedy in recent memory -- Congress buckled to the pharmacy industry and enacted a pitifully weak law that allows individual companies to decide for themselves whether they want to register with the Food and Drug Administration and be subject to regulation. Hospitals will want their suppliers to step up, went the rationale. But because small pharmacies undercut big ones on price, it's anyone's guess if this theory will pan out in practice. Meanwhile, regulators found serious problems at every one of the two dozen facilities they audited after the Massachusetts incident.State criminal laws incorporate the principle that corporate executives, who act recklessly, without the intent to cause a specific bad outcome but with the knowledge that it is very likely to occur, can be held culpable. And for good reason: When people die as a result of such wanton behavior, state prosecutors can and should prosecute senior executives for manslaughter. Alternatively, federal prosecutors may not be able to file manslaughter charges, but they have ample tools to punish such wrongdoing, including statutes that require reporting of adverse events and outlaw false statements to the government.Conservative commentators argue that corporations are abstract paper entities that cannot go to jail and therefore should not be charged, and that if large criminal fines are imposed, innocent shareholders will end up as ""collateral damage."" These arguments ignore profits unfairly collected and distributed to shareholders as a result of criminal acts, as well as the crucial deterrence established by such cases. The vast majority of investors have little interest in allowing short-sighted managers to run companies into situations where they lose billions in damages, cleanup costs, and plummeting stock prices. These recent prosecutions are a reminder to executives and boards of directors that when reckless behavior costs lives, there should be consequences for the company, its bottom line, and its leadership.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC), talks during a news conference on NSA terrorist surveillance programs on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC Thursday, March 16, 2006. (Photo by Chuck Kennedy/MCT/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e36b3c000066000dfd23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The operation was as quick as it was shocking: three French nationals, Said Kouachi, Cherif Kouachi, and Haymd Mourad, burst into the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in downtown Paris with Kalashnikov rifles and methodically killed the journalists inside who were in the middle of an editorial meeting. One witness counted over 50 bullets over a span of five minutes, and other witnesses who were in the immediate area ducked for cover with their cellphone cameras and recorded two individuals dressed in black challenging any police officer who got in their way. CNN, Fox News, and BBC, in addition to many others around the world, rolled the same footage of the assault over and over again in what seemed like an endless loop throughout the day -- two heavily armed men, shooting and wounding a police officer outside of the Charlie Hebdo building before calmly walking towards the man and executing him. Only a few miles away, on the other side of Paris, two assailants barged into a kosher supermarket, killed four people inside, and took hostages before being killed by French police a few hours later. One of the suspects in the supermarket shooting claimed allegiance to the Islamic State before being killed, and called the assault on the market was reportedly timed and coordinated with the Kouachi brothers' shooting of the Charlie Hebdo offices. One suspect, a woman, remains on the run from French authorities.Unfortunately, Europeans and Americans have witnessed this type of terrorist attack in the past. Whether it was the 2009 shooting at Ford Hood by an Army Seargent-turned-jihadist, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three individuals, the killing of three innocent people at a Jewish museum in Brussels last year, or the killing of three hostages in Sydney, Australia only several weeks ago, the incident that Parisians experienced on January 7, 2014 is a graphic illustration of what terrorism has become in the 21st Century. Groups like al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Pakistani Taliban, or the Islamic State no longer need to plan and execute an operation that kills hundreds at a time and knocks down buildings 110 stories high. Today, it only takes a single individual with a weapon, an intent to kill, and a willingness to die to terrorize an entire nation.France is a country in a complete state of alert, having suffered its worst terrorist attack in half a century. But, in the globalized world that we live in, even an attack as far away as Paris can have an impact here in the United States, where a security-conscience Republican Party newly resurgent after sweeping the midterm elections last November now has a chance to strengthen an argument that the party has been repeating for most of the past year: anything that limits what the U.S. intelligence community can do is a bone-headed move nearly identical to shooting yourself in the foot.  Getty ImagesIndeed, hours after the Paris shooting occurred, Republican lawmakers took to the airwaves to not only publicly pledge support to the French during their time of need, but to make the point that the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency need all of the authority and flexibility available in order to stop a similar ambush from happening on American soil. Some, like Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, used the occasion to take a personal swipe at President Barack Obama and his record on terrorism.The politics of national security and the struggle between the principles of security and liberty are, and will remain, constant battles in the United States. Periods of calm in the homeland tend to have a calming effect on the American public, and when Americans are fortunate enough to escape the violence that afflicts so many others around the globe, it becomes a nuisance or inconvenience to take one's shoes off at the airport or ignoring. The NSA, instead of being of an intelligence agency protecting the lives of Americans at home and abroad, resembles something closer to a suspicious and unaccountable second-government snooping on our phone calls and watching what we spend, what we buy, and who we email. Yet, when an act of terrorism occurs, either against Americans, an American facility, or a close American partner like the French, the balance between security and liberty begins to shift in the other direction. Sure, you may want to carry a water bottle on the plane with you, but if getting rid of that bottle helps make the flight more secure for everyone, then why not throw it away in the trash?Just as the gruesome beheadings of three Americans in Syria rallied a once war-weary public to support the deployment of U.S. troops and combat aircraft against Islamic State targets in both Iraq and Syria, the mercilessly brutal assault on the editors and cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo could have the effect of convincing more Americans that the U.S. intelligence community should at the very least keep the power and authority they have in order to detect a similar act of violence. Senators Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker, Richard Burr, and retired congressman Mike Rogers went on television throughout the day to lobby for precisely that belief: namely, that the intelligence community must be fully functional, fully funded, and must have all the surveillance powers it needs to ""connect the dots"" before a similar, Charlie Hebdo-like assault happens around the confines of a major U.S. newspaper, building, or landmark. Or, as Sen. Graham's own words, ""we must use this horrific attack as an opportunity to reevaluate our own national security posture. I fear our intelligence capabilities, those designed to prevent such an attack from taking place on our shores, are quickly eroding.""Remember last November, when Democrats and a few Republicans were getting ready to pass legislation that would have made it more difficult for the NSA to acquire the metadata of Americans' telephone calls? Well, in a post-Charlie Hebdo world, that legislation no longer looks as appetizing."

Great book, OK movie. The book left me feeling that I need to find my passion, set new goals, get out there and explore. The movie left me feeling that I want blonde hair and skinny legs just like Reese Witherspoon. It left me longing for the days when I too, could leave the house without applying make up and drawing on my eyebrows. Kudos to Cheryl Strayed though, an amazing accomplishment on all fronts.Cheryl decided to hike the Pacific Coast Trail after the death of her beloved mother sent her into a downward spiral of drugs and infidelities, until she finally hit rock bottom. Rock bottom is a hideous place and at some point in our lives we have all been there. Some of us face it sooner as in Cheryl's case, and some a little later in life. Midlife rock bottoms can be REALLY devastating. Perhaps it is the death of a parent, a financial tragedy, a cancer diagnosis, a troubled child, or, as in my case: a divorce.After 27 years of marriage, my husband decided it was time to move on, greener pastures, younger ass, blonder hair, you get it. I hit MY rock bottom. My children lived on McDonalds and Velveeta Microwave Mac and Cheese, as I holed up in my room, cloaked in my blue Snuggie unable to fathom a life beyond those days. And then finally, finally -- I pulled myself up and out and began to live again.Hitting rock bottom at 47 is much different than hitting it in your twenties. In your twenties, you can disappear, go find yourself, climb mountains, accomplish major feats of strength. There was no way I could hike the PCT -- me -- a person who brings a gel seat and a clip on fan to spin class. My knees are pretty much chalk dust now. Plus, I would need an extra pack just for my various meds, anti anxiety, anti-diarrheal, anti-aging, anti-hunger, anti-heart disease, anti high cholesterol, well, I mean the list goes on. Plus, at this time in our lives, it may not be possible to just take off for three months and leave our jobs, our children, our significant other, our Tivo. It begs the question, where can those of us midlife folks find OUR wild?  Here are some of the ways I found MY Wild, perhaps they may work for you as well:1. Go back to school: When I was half way through my junior year of college I made a life changing decision: I was on my way to a Spanish test that I didn't study for, I mean really, like THAT would ever come in handy. I turned around, headed to the admissions office where I dropped out. I then called my boyfriend, told him I wanted to get married and three weeks later was an Army wife. Fast forward almost 30 years later -- I went back to college and I loved it. Sure I was the oldest one in the class and no one wanted to be my project partner, but so what? My mind opened up and I found my voice. It changed my life.2. Take a trip--alone: Now don't go all ""Easy for you to say!"" on me. I am not talking about pulling an Eat Pray Love, traveling the world eating pasta and meditating. I'm talking about a journey where you go someplace that intrigues you or offers you a sense of peace and happiness. It could mean just a long weekend at a nearby beach, or city. There's something about the planning, anticipating and then living it that is very freeing and makes you feel competent and alive.3. Get a job: This of course pertains to those of us who up until now were not working. When I had my final meeting with my divorce attorney she suggested that, ""Hey, you may want to think about finding employment,"" because for some reason, during mediation I had agreed to temporary alimony. It's easy to be lulled into an agreeable mood when being plied with Keurig espressos and free Tootsie Rolls at a glass conference table. I freaked. The last time I held a job, I was wearing Bonnie Bell Lip Smackers and stepping all over my bell-bottoms. But I did it. I found a job at a local holistic spa for $8 an hour, greeting customers and folding linens. Guess what? I loved it, and met some great people while mastering folding the fitted sheet. It also brought me new opportunities and fodder for my writing.4. Downsize: At this point in life we have accumulated a lot of stuff. Has that little glass ashtray been sitting on your coffee table since the early 80's? Do you even smoke anymore? Are you REALLY going to re-read all those books that line your shelves, coffee tables, and night stands? You can download them on Kindle, you know. Purge. Maybe even think of selling your home where most of the bedrooms are now guestrooms, and that Wolfe gas range where you created hundreds of family dinners, is now basically used to boil your tea water. A condo in the city may be a huge leap, but a whole new way of living, with an exciting dynamic. Something to think about? A small home by the beach? A back yard of sand and ocean? How bad could that be?5. Stop saying ""I could never do that""--YOU CAN: ""I could never write a book,"" ""I could never run a marathon,"" ""I could never learn to make home made pasta."" Yes you can. It's now or never folks. We ain't getting any younger.Finding your WILD in midlife doesn't mean walking hundreds of miles alone with a tent. It means finding peace, confidence, a sense of self and happiness. It means finding YOU. Dig deep. Figure it out and then...go wild.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Amid the masses, it can feel like your hilarious commentary is not getting you the thousands of followers you deserve. With the fleeting glory of favorites and retweets in mind, HuffPost Entertainment spoke with Lara Cohen, Twitter Head of Talent, to figure out the best ways to build your numbers during the show on Sunday night.Tweet at your favorite famous people. Don't be scared, maybe Uzo Aduba will finally respond to you! ""Tweet at your favorite nominees,"" Cohen said. ""They're all on their phones, they're all checking Twitter while they're there. A lot of stars will even do things like answer questions during the limo ride to the show.""Tweet at other not even remotely famous people. Interaction is a great way to both build your following and find more people to follow. Engage with other people during the event. And don't just favorite things you enjoy, actually respond to them. Cohen recommended spending more time actually tweeting back and forth with others. Curate your newsfeed by making or subscribing to a list ... A list provides a fine-tuned feed, without revamping your account. ""It's good to do this in advance for the [specific] show you're watching,"" Cohen said. ""Include a healthy mix of friends, comedians, entertainment writers, nominees and presenters who are on Twitter."" (Pro-tip: Retta and Billy Eichner are A+ to follow during awards shows / all the time.) ... And / or by muting annoying accounts. Muting is a great way to not have to see people who are either not tweeting about the awards or just not being as hilarious as you. And it's easier than throwing shade with an un-follow. ""If there's, say, annoying 'Modern Family' fans, you can always un-mute them when the show is over,"" Cohen said.Search for things that happen during the show. If something funny happens and you have a really funny thing to say about that thing, it's likely other people do too. Use the search function to find a specific event or observation (i.e. ""Jacqueline Bisset drunk"") throughout the night.Use the official hashtag: #GoldenGlobes. This is good for finding other folks tweeting about the show (and can help them to find you). Also, pay attention to what's trending. ""Both the hash tag and trending terms are a good way to find bigger names who you may not even know are on Twitter, because all of the verified accounts will surface to the top of that conversation,"" Cohen said. Finally: Cohen says, ""be authentic."" Always best to just be yourself -- kind of like in real life!The Golden Globe Awards air Sunday at 8:00 p.m. ET on NBC."

They have yet to begin construction several years later, according to India's Department of Atomic Energy. (Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Douglas Busvine and Raissa Kasolowsky)"
