Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-business-of-isis_b_11142954.html,,2016-07-24,2016-07-22-1469217212-5802143-ISISOilalomaroilfieldalalam_635830290788870072_25f_4x3.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-22-1469217212-5802143-ISISOilalomaroilfieldalalam_635830290788870072_25f_4x3-thumb.jpg,"Islamic State controlled Omar oil field in Syria on fire following an attack by US Air Force planes Photograph courtesy Al-AlamThe Islamic State (IS) has been described as being either one of the world's richest terrorist organization or as one of its poorest countries. In reality neither is quite true. Although it has many of the attributes of a sovereign nation state, including its own passports (which no other country recognizes) and currency, and controls a specific geographic area, albeit one with amorphous borders, it falls sort of being an independent nation state. Conversely, it is more than just a subversive or terrorist organization since it possesses capabilities and assets that go well beyond the typical terrorist group. Instead it is a sort of hybrid, half destitute quasi-nation state and half wealthy militant jihadist organization.What it does have, however, are considerable financial assets, a combination of war booty from its lightening conquests in eastern Syria and western Iraq, as well as its profits from a variety of legal and illegal ""businesses"" in which it is engaged. As enterprises go it is extremely well diversified, with multiple sources of revenue from a range of disparate activities. Moreover, it has been successful in organizing these activities so that they are not dependent on the international financial system, and are not affected by the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies.At its low point from roughly 2007-2009, during the rise of the U.S. sponsored Awakening Councils, the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), the predecessor ""state"" to the Islamic State, had revenues of approximately one million to two million dollars per month. The principal sources of funds were donations from wealthy supporters in the Gulf, as well as proceeds from kidnappings and extortion. At its peak in late 2014 and early 2015, the recently announced Islamic State had revenues estimated at around four million to five million dollars a day, roughly 1.5 billion per year. Some estimates were as high as two billion dollars. Since then it's estimated that its revenues have dropped by half.Taxation and extortion, it's hard to tell the difference between them in the Islamic State, are the organization's biggest sources of revenue. Technically, IS charges a tax of 10 percent on income although there are plenty of other taxes and fees. Services, for example, are subject to an additional 20 percent surcharge. Withdrawals from bank accounts are penalized by a 10 percent tax. Non-Muslims are subject to the jizya tax of 50 percent of earnings. Muslims that violate Sharia law are required to pay a ""repentance tax"" of approximately $2,500. In addition, IS sells permission to leave the Islamic State to those not considered essential, in return for a payment of around $2,000 and forfeiture of any assets left behind. Islamic State issued passportsIn total, at its peak IS earned between $300 million and $400 million yearly from such activities. Paradoxically, one of its most lucrative sources of revenue was the roughly $170 million a month that the Iraqi government payed to its government employees in areas controlled by the Islamic State. Many of those employees continued working at their jobs under IS supervision and their salaries were subject to additional taxation. The Iraqi government suspended these payments in September 2015. Combined with its loss of territory, IS's ""tax revenues"" are believed to have dropped by half. This is a hard number of calculate since the distinctions between taxation, extortion and outright expropriation in the Islamic State are not always clear cut. Oil had been Islamic State's most profitable activity. At its peak it controlled about 50,000 barrels of production a day (BOPD). In fact, it was al-Nusra Front's, a jihadist organization that IS had sponsored and funded, seizure of an oil field in central Syria that had prompted Abu Bakr al Baghdadi to announce the merger of al-Nusra and ISI to create the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). IS does not control any refineries. It briefly contested control of the Bajii refinery, Iraq's largest, during late 2014 and 2015, but was never able to achieve sufficient control to actually operate it. Instead it has relied on rudimentary mobile refineries that are capable of refining about 1,000 liters of oil a day. Both crude oil and refined products are smuggled to Turkey where they are resold on the black market. The oil smuggling network dates back to the days when the UN mandated sanctions against Saddam Hussein's oil exports. IS did not create the oil smuggling network, it simply took advantage of the one that already existed. In addition, there have been numerous reports that IS has frequently sold oil and natural gas to the Assad government or swapped it for electricity.The smugglers themselves are independent operators and are not part of IS. They typically purchase the oil from IS and resell it in Turkey. Initially, the U.S. and its allies targeted Islamic State's mobile refineries and its oil infrastructure, but ignored the smugglers. About six months ago, U.S. planes began dropping leaflets advising the smugglers that their tankers would be subject to attack if they persisted in smuggling petroleum. To date, hundreds of oil tanker trucks have been destroyed by coalition air strikes.Islamic State mobile/modular oil refinery destroyed by coalition air strikes  Picture courtesy US Dept. of Defense.On average its believed that IS receives between 35 percent and 50 percent of the market price for its oil. At its peak, its oil smuggling was generating between $500 million and $750 million in revenues. Since then, declining production and the fall in oil prices has cut its revenue from oil to between $150 million and $200 million. Oil production is believed to have fallen to between 20,000 and 25,000 BOPD, as a result of the loss of some oil fields and a decline in production caused by a shortage of spare parts and qualified personnel to maintain oil field equipment. The illegal sale of antiquities is estimated to generate around $50 to $100 million in revenues for Islamic State. There are approximately 4,500 identified archeological sites in IS controlled territory. The Islamic State awards sites to local villagers on condition it receives a portion of whatever antiquities are discovered. The smuggling of antiquities has existed in this region for generations. Once again, IS did not create the smuggling activity or the network, it simply expanded the supply and took advantage of the activity for its own ends. Most items are smuggled into Turkey, and to a lesser extent Lebanon, from where they are resold to dealers and collectors around the world. IS has also looted museums, the Mosul museum being the most notable, in cities it controls. Some of the publicized destruction of archeological sites, like Palmyra in Syria and Nineveh in Iraq, may have been staged to hide the looting of those sites. Kidnappings generate between $25 million and $50 million a year for the Islamic State. The United States, Great Britain and Japan have publically refused to ransom any of their nationals held by the Islamic State. Other countries, including notably France and Italy, however, have in the past payed such ransoms. IS has also generated revenues from holding hostage some of its own constituents, especially members of non-Muslim groups, like the Yazidi and the Assyrian Christians. Wealthy donors still figure prominently in the Islamic State's source of cash. In the early days of the organization, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi would publish metrics demonstrating that al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), IS's predecessor, was responsible for a majority of the killings and bombings taking place in Iraq as a way of demonstrating the organization's effectiveness to donors. The practice of quantifying the scope of its activity and its ""market share"" of terrorist acts has continued under the Islamic State. The Temple of Bel in Palmyra before it was largely destroyed by Islamic State jihadists It is difficult to estimate the financial contribution of private donors to IS. Billions of dollars have flowed from the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf to fund various Sunni rebel groups in Syria. In addition, money often moves from charity to charity so that by the time it is given out its source is not readily apparent. The definition of ""humanitarian aid"" is pretty loose. Moreover, jihadists often move around between different organizations taking their supplies with them. It's believed that the Islamic State is still receiving between $20 million and $40 million in contributions from wealthy supporters, but it is possible that the number could be much larger. Finally, ""loot"" is a significant source of funding for the Islamic State. War booty is not an ongoing business; not unless the Islamic State was relentlessly expanding. Nonetheless, the groups initial conquests proved to be particularly lucrative. It's believed that IS acquired between 500 million and 800 million in U.S. currency from various banks in its domain. The Mosul branch of the Iraqi Central Bank had cash reserves of around $400-500 million when it was seized by IS militants.In addition, the Islamic State has resold real estate, equipment and military hardware that it seized during its 2014 conquest. There have been reports, so far unconfirmed, that IS has resold arms to jihadist groups in the Caucasus. It's impossible to know what the total value of these assets are, which ones still exist, what has been destroyed and what proceeds were obtained from those that were sold. On January 11, 2016, for example, the U.S. bombed a depot where IS was storing some of its cash reserves. Subsequent reports from the Pentagon claimed that upwards of $600 million had been destroyed. It's difficult to verify such reports however. There have also been reports of other, grislier, sources of funding for Islamic State. On February 17, 2015, Iraq's ambassador to the UN, Mohammed al-Hakim, claimed that IS was harvesting organs from dead jihadist fighters and civilians. A similar charge was later made by Iranian news sources and publicized by Russian media. There is no proof of such activities, however, and it is unlikely that IS has the necessary medical infrastructure to ""harvest"" viable organs and transport them. As of June 2016, it is estimated that Islamic State is generating between $40 million to $80 million a month in revenues. Roughly half of that amount is coming from taxes and fees it levies on its constituents, as well as expropriations and the balance from a variety of illegal activities. Its military operations are believed to cost it somewhere between $20 million and $30 million a month, although the exact number is difficult to fix. Likewise, it is unclear what IS spends on administration and services. Islamic State Annual Report with an executive summary of its terrorist activitiesWhat is likely, however, is that Islamic State is not generating enough revenues to fund its operations. The salaries of its militants have been cut in half - from around $400 per month to about $200. Services have been cut back even further, prices on food and gasoline have been increased. There are consistent reports of shortages of medicines and other essential items, although it's not clear if those shortages are the result off insufficient cash or a Turkish crackdown on smuggling. There are also reports that Islamic State is becoming involved in other criminal activities, specifically the smuggling of marijuana from the Balkans into Western Europe. The Islamic State has a lot of assets under its control. Its ability to liquefy them, however, is limited by what it can smuggle into Turkey and elsewhere. Many of its assets can only be sold to its increasingly impoverished citizens. Outside of cash, their multi-billion dollar value is largely theoretical. Moreover, lacking access to a port and landlocked by hostile neighbors, its ability to import critical items is constrained by what it can smuggle across its borders, regardless of whether it has the cash to pay for them. From the United State's standpoint, the most effective way to shut down the Islamic State's financing is to target those activities that generate cash like the smuggling of oil and antiquities and the organization's existing cash reserves. The U.S. and its allies are now finally focusing on precisely this objective, pity it didn't start sooner."

Many of its assets can only be sold to its increasingly impoverished citizens. Outside of cash, their multi-billion dollar value is largely theoretical. Moreover, lacking access to a port and landlocked by hostile neighbors, its ability to import critical items is constrained by what it can smuggle across its borders, regardless of whether it has the cash to pay for them. From the United State's standpoint, the most effective way to shut down the Islamic State's financing is to target those activities that generate cash like the smuggling of oil and antiquities and the organization's existing cash reserves. The U.S. and its allies are now finally focusing on precisely this objective, pity it didn't start sooner."

But how much time do you spend working on YOU and your mindset? I heard a story recently that will help you answer that exact question. There was a man sitting at the kitchen table, having a morning cup of coffee and reading the Sunday paper. His son came sprinting down the stairs, buzzing for a day out with his dad and ready to go out and play. The previous night, his dad had promised that they would spend the whole day together so he kept his diary free so that he could spend quality time with his son. However, he needed just a few more minutes to finish his morning routine, so he had an idea to buy himself a little bit more time. He ripped out a picture of the world, a few pages back in his newspaper, and tore it in to about 30 tiny pieces. He placed them on to the table in front of his son and said:'Let's play a game. Here's a puzzle; as soon as you can put this picture of the world back together, we will go out and start our day together.' The dad picked up the paper and continued reading and less than a couple of minutes went by and his son excitedly pulled the paper to one side and said, 'Dad, I'm done!' The dad was astonished to see that his son was able to do that so quickly. Obviously, he asked him how he managed to do it. The son explained that a piece of paper fell on to the floor and when he bent over to pick it up he could see through the bottom of the glass table that there was a picture of a man on the back of all the little pieces. So he turned all the pieces over and put the man together. Once he did that, the world just fell in to place. So often we see the world as the ruler of our destiny when, in reality, we are the vehicle to our own destiny. We get from the world what we invest in ourselves. Piecing together the world you want is an impossible task if you haven't created your ideal self first. #EachOneTeachOne"
6,BUSINESS,Obstacles to Creative Disruption,"Ira Kalb, ContributorAssistant Professor of Clinical Marketing, Marshall School of ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obstacles-to-creative-dis_b_11171194.html,,2016-07-24,2016-07-24-1469395725-3439471-ObstaclesCreatDisrupt.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-24-1469395725-3439471-ObstaclesCreatDisrupt-thumb.jpg,"This is the second post in my Creative Disruption trilogy. The first one provided strategies to protect your company from disruption. In this one, I would like to focus on the obstacles that companies need to overcome if their product or business is likely to disrupt the marketplace. Companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Tesla, and Amazon have had to overcome a sufficient number of these obstacles to put their companies on the path to success. Perhaps they could have had smoother sailing or greater success quicker if they had anticipated some of these obstacles and developed strategies to overcome them. Overcoming them will be the subject of my third post in this trilogy. For now, lets look at the obstacles you are likely to face if you disrupt the marketplace.HabitsFrom a marketing viewpoint, habits are perhaps the biggest obstacle for a disruptive technology, company or product to overcome. Why? Habits are ingrained in the brain. They are similar to ""grooves"" that humans fall back into even when they try to break habits such as changing eating patterns to lose weight.The human brain is designed to protect us from harm. Habits are shortcuts our brains take (with less conscious thought) so we can be available for emergencies and more important things that come along. People try products. If they work sufficiently well, there is no compelling reason to seek alternatives. In fact, it takes conscious work and effort to change habits. Since people are busy or lazy, they fall into these habits. They say that to avoid arguments, you should avoid discussing religion and politics. One reason is they tend to be deeply-ingrained in the belief system of the human brain, and people get very emotional when a company does or says something that goes against their belief system.Branding is a powerful marketing tool that companies employ to get buyers to select their products without much conscious thought. The stronger the brand relationship, the more difficult it will be for another brand to break that habit.Push back from the disruptedCompanies and people that work for them will see their livelihoods threatened when a disruptive product or technology comes along to threaten their continued success. They will ""fight like hell"" to extinguish the threat - making it all the more difficult for the disruptive force to succeed.Government regulationsPeople have different views about government regulations - depending on whether they perceive them to be a protective or threatening. Speed limits are set to protect lives. Those in a hurry drive over the speed limit, and believe speed limits are for the other drivers that do not drive as well. Companies that are regulated do not like regulations because they tend to slow down product development and raise costs. A new drug may take 7 to 10 long years for FDA approval even if it could save lives. The reason for these regulations is some drugs that were sold, such as Thalidomide, caused birth defects and other serious health problems. When that happens, victims sue the companies and the Government. To protect health and avoid lawsuits, the Government takes its time to reduce the risk to the public of new products that could cause harm and trigger litigation. After all, when the Government pays, taxpayers foot the bill.Uneducated buyers Disruptive products and technologies have capabilities that are often unknown to buyers. For buyers to desire these products, they need to first be educated as to what they are and what they can do for them. This takes time. Marketing strategies can shorten the time, but they have to be sufficiently good to be effective. Inadequately educated sellers The more innovative companies tend to be run by technical people that diminish the importance of marketing, think inside-out, and believe the buyer will understand the benefits of the disruptive product as well as they do. This creates an obstacle as big, or sometimes even bigger, than buyer habits. If the decision makers in the company do not even know the importance of branding and communications, how will they teach the public the benefits? This is why Peter Drucker, considered the father of management consulting, said... ""Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two-and only two-basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.""PoliticsWhile related to Government regulations, politics is much broader and a huge obstacle to disruption. People that feel their companies and jobs will be threatened by disruption will exert their political power to try to stop the disruptive companies and products. Ever since they started, Uber and Airbnb have been under attack by the disrupted for all sorts of reasons. Tesla and Solar City have targets on their backs because they disrupt the automotive and energy industries as they are presently constituted.Financing sourcesOn the one hand, smart and confident finance people know that the risks are proportional to the gains. The bigger the risk, the bigger the potential gain. However, because of their responsibilities to their constituents (that naively want upside gain without downside risk) most financing sources tend be risk averse. They think the bigger the risk, the bigger the potential losses. To get financing in early stages, therefore, disruptive companies have to use their own funds, get financing from friends and family, or find angel investors online and off. Since money is the mother's milk of business, this can be a huge obstacle to disruption.Change avoidanceWhile somewhat related to habits, change avoidance is broader. The primitive part of the human brain that seeks to protect us will resist change. There is a great fear of the unknown since the vast majority of people only seek change if they are sufficiently uncomfortable with the status quo or brilliant marketing forces effectively communicate the benefits of change.Disruption is not easyBecause of the obstacles above, and others I did not cover, disruption may sound great to inventors, but is rarely easy. To help insure the success of any disruption, step one is to be aware of the obstacles. The worst thing a new business can do is to be unaware. Once the obstacles and pitfalls are identified the next step is to develop strategies to overcome them. That is the subject of my next post in this trilogy."

In a Legislature which, at the time in the mid-1990s, still was controlled by Democrats, the young Democrat from South Florida succeeded at a personal agenda in which few freshman-or-woman lawmakers ever succeed at winning.For this, the Tallahassee press corps fondly dubbed her ""Rep. Debbie Wasserperson.""As the Florida Legislature was turning Republican, she served several years in the House and then some in the state Senate. By 2004, she won election to Congress in Florida's 23rd District -- the first Jewish congresswoman elected from Florida.Married to Steve Schultz, and as a mother of twins, the congressperson revealed her battle with breast cancer in 2009. She is a survivor of a double mastectomy.As chair of the Democratic National Committee, mother and member of Congress at the same time, Wasserman Schultz has been a passionate spokesperson for both the party and its causes. It was also difficult for anyone who knew her to see how she could support anyone but the candidate who has a strong chance of becoming the first woman elected president of the United States.It turns out, from the recently revealed email record in a party which has been bedeviled by emails this year, that the party's chair was working just a little too hard for one of the party's candidates, the woman, Hillary Clinton. It only fulfilled Sen. Bernie Sanders' complaint that the party -- of which he really wasn't even a member -- had ""rigged"" its primaries and caucuses.So this riven party will convene in Philadelphia this week, and at week's end Wasserman Schultz will step down as chair. She'll still be a member of Congress.And she'll still be Debbie Wasserperson."

It is crucially important that they unite to defeat Donald Trump -- and then work together to win progressive change for all Americans.A huge impediment to unity has been removed: Debbie Wasserman-Schultze announced on Sunday she is resigning as Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Bernie Sanders and supporters had long complained she undermined him in setting primary rules. And leaked DNC emails showed DNC staffers conspiring to sabotage his campaign. Only hours after Sanders renewed his call for her to resign, saying the emails confirmed their long-time complaints DNC bias, Wasserman-Schultze was gone -- and unlikely to even speak at the convention. Long-time Democratic leader, Donna Brazille, who stayed authentically neutral in the primaries, will lead the DNC through the general election.The Sanders Democratic Party complained, and Hillary Clinton, the leader of the other Democratic Party responded -- because she wants the support of his new insurgent movement. And Bernie Sanders once again made it clear he wants his supporters to support Clinton -- to defeat Donald Trump and because he thinks his new progressive movement will continue to transform Democratic politics. And, now that this problem has been dealt with, he will make this case in his convention speech Monday night.But there are still two parties. The Democratic Party of Hillary Clinton and her just-announced Vice-Presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, was led early in their careers by ""New Democrats"" who believed their party could be ""progressive"" only as long as they did not challenge the political power of corporate America. The Democratic Leadership Council, founded by Bill Clinton, argued that Democrats needed to finance their campaigns with money from at least a portion of the corporate elite and the richest one percent. But they also argued that Democrats had to be ""pro-business"" in order to win the support of middle-American voters. Early on, these ""New Democrats"" even argued that Democrats needed to keep civil rights advocates at arm's length in order to win elections.To his great credit, Kaine has demonstrated, as mayor of Richmond and as a state-wide candidate in Virginia, that inter-racial coalitions can win in the South by being strong on civil rights and sensible gun laws. Hillary, of course has evolved from her New Dem roots -- and she has always inspired considerable support from women, African-Americans, and Hispanics -- key parts of the ""rising American electorate.""But there is a new force in the Democratic Party, represented by the Bernie Sanders campaign, with a very different strategy for winning elections -- a strategy built on an economic agenda for the people, not the wealthy -- and a fundraising strategy which can give Democrats the freedom to attack the growing problems of inequality, declining wages and economic stagnation. The Bernie Sanders movement pushed and educated Hillary Clinton and many other Democrats during the presidential campaign. And the result was considerable unity around a Platform shaped by the Sanders movement for change. Tim Kaine, her choice for Vice President, is having to catch up quickly to make sure that the Clinton-Kaine campaign doesn't alienate Sanders voters Clinton is counting on to win.Kaine's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal was immediately criticized by progressives and Sanders supporters. Hillary Clinton has felt the pressure of TPP critics on the campaign trail and declared her opposition months ago. On Friday, when Kaine's new role was announced, Clinton staffers immediately told MSNBC's Kristen Welker that Kaine would now oppose the TPP. On Saturday came the announcement from a Kaine spokesperson that ""He agreed with [Clinton's] judgment that it fell short"" when it came to protecting wages and national security. Now Clinton and Kaine need to take their opposition to TPP into the campaign, showing Sanders voters -- and voters in industrial states tempted to go for Trump -- that they really mean it when they say they will stop the TPP.Kaine's recent letters to Senate colleagues, lobbying to weaken public oversight of banks, could throw into question Hillary's public commitment to tough financial reform and oversight. The Clinton campaign needs to clarify where he stands -- perhaps at a Tim Kaine-Elizabeth Warren rally on the dangers of an unregulated banking system. The sooner the better.Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine come from an older, more cautious wing of the Democratic party -- a wing that been slowly evolving since the days when Governor Tim Kaine also had the job of begging big-money donors to finance Democratic political campaigns. Today that old Democratic Party is quickly being transformed from the grassroots up -- and we will see that transformation in progress this week.At the Convention in Philadelphia close to half of the delegates -- almost 1,900 -- are pledged to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders. They are there as the result of an incredibly successful campaign that won in 22 states, 43 percent of the popular vote. And the ""Sanders Party"" came so close to winning the national election without taking a penny of support from corporate America, including the big banks. This new Sanders progressive party operating within the Democratic party raised over $230 million through average donations of $27 from millions of supporters to finance its amazing volunteer organizer network.Bernie Sanders generated incredible enthusiasm among voters not just because he refused to take big corporate money. Young voters, progressive voters, working people and independent voters rallied to Sanders precisely because he boldly declared that irresponsible corporate power and the influence of wealthy Americans was a big part of the cause of America's growing inequality, joblessness and a dysfunctional government unable to grapple with obvious problems like global warming and racial injustice.In order to win the nomination, Hillary Clinton had to learn from Sanders. She quickly moved to oppose the Keystone XL Pipeline and the TPP. She quickly started talking about big public investments to create jobs and retool America's energy economy to dramatically reduce carbon pollution. And she tried to match Sanders with primary voters by declaring her opposition to the TPP and claimed she would strengthen and go beyond the Dodd-Frank bank reform law to regulate the banking system.Because Hillary needs to win the general election support of Sanders voters, the Clinton team allowed the Bernie supporters to write much of the Democratic Platform. The result was a progressive victory. Here's what Bernie had to say about the outcome in an email to supporters:You should know that in the weeks since the last primary, both campaigns have worked together in good faith to bridge some of the policy issues that divided us during the election. Did we come to agreement on everything? Of course not. But we made important steps forward.As Sanders says, the new populists and the old Democrats did not agree on everything - and, assuming we help Hillary win, the battle over issues will continue, even on issues where the 2016 platform says the two Democratic Parties agree.But all progressives must ask themselves: is there any way that this productive debate on issues will continue if we pretend the November election is not that important - and the crazy, intolerant, opportunistic and irresponsible Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.As the Democratic Convention opens on Monday, the issue fights and primary debates and Platform discussions have allowed us to air our differences, demand (and get) leadership changes. In the process we have discovered a lot of points of agreement and respect between the two Democratic Parties. Now is the time to work together to defeat Trump and win control of the White House, the US Senate - and even, if we reach out to our fellow Americans voters, to win back the House of Representatives.And that's when the interesting politics really begin. But first we work for the victory over Trump."

The police car’s muddy tracks are gone. There’s a colorful new garden. Kids play at a water park around the corner, a few dozens teens are playing basketball inside the gym and some children watch adults wearing tie-die lab coats conduct an experiment with liquid nitrogen. A toy red Nerf Rival Apollo Blaster that shoots small yellow foam balls lays in the grass near the pavilion, a few feet from some wooden crosses. A pile of stuffed animals ― teddy bears, Snoopy, a turtle ― sit on a table near the spot where a Cleveland police office shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice less than two seconds after he encountered him at a playground on Nov. 22, 2014.A short car ride away, at the Quicken Loans Arena, Donald Trump became the Republican presidential nominee on Thursday. People in militia gear carrying semi-automatic rifles posed for photos with onlookers near the arena this week, as police on bikes focused on keeping the religious extremists and the anarchists apart. Inside, a massive crowd chanted “All Lives Matter,” a guy in a Trump hat carried around a sign that said “ISIS Lives Don’t Matter,” and a sheriff who has become a fixture in the conservative media drew thunderous applause by declaring that “Blue Lives Matter.” This is amid one of the safest times to be a police officer in recorded history in a country where the government pours billions of dollars into supporting cops and protecting their valued lives. Trump’s message of safety seemed aimed at a particular audience and not necessarily families that look like look like Tamir’s, as Charles M. Blow pointed out in The New York Times this week.During his lengthy acceptance speech, the former reality TV personality painted a picture of an America in crisis, where violent crime was spiking (it isn’t) and proclaimed himself to be the only man who could fix it.Those I spoke with on the floor of the Republican National Convention were convinced that America was getting more dangerous. This is despite violent crime rate data showing that every year of the Obama administration has been safer than any year during the presidency of George W. Bush. But people didn’t feel that fact was true. Trump’s own campaign manager even suggested that the FBI ― currently run by a former Bush administration official who had been registered as Republican and donated to GOP campaigns ― must be cooking the books on crime to make President Barack Obama look better. When I sat down at the bench under the pavilion at the Cudell Recreation Center that appeared in the video of Tamir’s death, I realized I too may have created a false narrative in my own mind based on, videos and media reports. Much like the violent country Trump created before an audience of millions on Thursday night, the tough neighborhood I’d created in my head to fill in the world outside the limited scope of the surveillance camera that captured Tamir’s final moments did not exist. Take away the handful of reporters and cameras that stopped by and the members of the communist Progressive Labor Party who came to recruit and the park where Tamir was killed looked a lot like one I would visit with my own young daughter. It’s tough for an out-of-town journalist to drop into a neighborhood in a city he’s never visited before for a few hours and walk away with anything meaningful to say, and I won’t pretend to do so here. But nearly two years ago, when I arrived in Ferguson, Missouri, a few days after the police shooting death of Michael Brown, I was struck by how little the area and the situation resembled the narrative I had formed in my mind based on what I had pieced together from news coverage and social media. When I saw heavily armored officers pointing weapons during demonstrations ― a part of me assumed there had to be some sort of legitimate threat behind the camera, when that was often not the case. This time, however, working with The Huffington Post’s RYOT team, I had the ability to allow readers to see a fuller, 360-degree picture of what I saw when I visited the park where Tamir was shot. It gives a much fuller view of the location beyond grainy surveillance footage.Among those I met was Robert Hargrove, a 66-year-old man who lives in the neighborhood. He was watching his grandchildren play in the park and told me he often went there. (Indeed, he spoke with a reporter from Gawker at the park the previous day). After his four-year-old grandson pointed to the location where Tamir was shot (or at least the spot where he knew something significant had happened), Hargrove told me he knew from the beginning that nothing would happen to the officers involved in the boy’s shooting. Indeed, a grand jury declined to indict an officer for Tamir’s death in December. After the City of Cleveland agreed in April to pay his family more than $6 million while admitting no wrongdoing, a police union official then suggested the money should go toward educating children on the dangers of real and replica weapons. “I knew they wasn’t gonna do nothing to him. But after looking at the film, they should’ve did something. I don’t know what they see that I didn’t see,” Hargrove said. “I don’t trust them,” he said, referring to police officers. “I don’t trust them around my kids, I don’t trust them near my kids.”Hargrove said he’s no Trump supporter, calling him a “trickster” who was dividing the country. “He’s being very, very honest, and its scares me,” Hargrove said. “It should scare a lot of us.”He pointed out that the former reality TV personality is “talking about alienating Mexicans, blacks, Hispanics.” “Until they do something about the racism, and this country finally really does something, it’s going to be the same,” Hargrove added. He’s “hopeful” that the presumptive Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton ― who has earned the endorsement of parents whose children police have killed, though not Tamir’s mother ― can bring about some change.“I’m so hopeful, I’m not even listening to the Republican convention,” Hargrove said. “I’m not going to play off into that rhetoric. What does he know about being president? About as much as I know about being president. He’s a billionaire, but that don’t mean he knows how to run a country.”"

But many GOP voters at the Republican National Convention this week saw the real estate mogul quite differently: as the man who could save the Republican Party by making it more socially liberal and inclusive.“It’s a great thing,” said Kris Beach, 63, of Port Charlotte, Florida, referring to Trump moving the party in a more socially liberal direction. “Don’t forget the Republicans are the ones that voted for the Civil Rights Act of ‘64,” Beach told The Huffington Post.Jim Wood, a lifelong Republican, noted that Trump is less focused on social issues than past GOP candidates, but he said, “There’s nothing wrong with that.”His wife Cindy wants to see the party welcome more minorities and thinks Trump will make progress in the coming months. “I saw Omarosa yesterday. She’s hopeful. I’m hopeful,” Cindy Wood said, referring to the former “Apprentice” contestant who is now director of African-American outreach for the Trump campaign.“I mean there’s a lot that still needs to change,” Wood said. “We’ll see how it goes.” That these hopes don’t seem to match with their presidential nominee’s much more negative image is something Trump supporters blame on the media.“They’re painting him as the king of all racists,” said James Davis, a 46-year-old African-American pastor from Cleveland. But Davis said he knows Trump personally and has never “heard him say one thing that is remotely directly racist.” Davis and another Cleveland area pastor, Darrell Scott, helped organize the meeting between Trump and 100 or so black religious leaders back in November, and Davis at least came away favorably impressed by Trump’s talk of rebuilding inner cities.Scott, who also spoke at the convention, told HuffPost, “We know he’s not a racist, we know he’s not a xenophobe.”Jim Wood doesn’t give much weight to some of the extreme things that Trump has said, like his proposal to deport 11 million undocumented people. “It’s like how every other politician says things that aren’t going to happen,” Wood said.Others view Trump’s inflammatory remarks as evidence that he’s a straight-talker who speaks his mind bluntly ― and then gets misinterpreted.“This political correctness has got us so messed up,” said one supporter.“Every time a politician [says] something that is interpreted as being wrong, the second they find out, they have to come out and make an apology,” said 20-year-old Louis Rockefeller, a scion of the politically active Arkansas branch of the Rockefeller family. “With Trump, he just doubles down. ... He just doesn’t give a damn.” After having lunch and speaking with Trump at an event his family hosted recently, Rockefeller said he now thinks that Trump could steer the party in a positive direction ― pushed along by the younger generation, perhaps.“We no longer live in Reagan’s America where pot is still bad, gays are still evil and the whole world just goes round and round by Jesus,” he said.But not everyone is buying that view. Julie Williams, a flutist who performed with the Cleveland Orchestra at a convention event on Monday, doesn’t consider Trump to be a positive figure within the GOP and doesn’t believe he’s moving the party to the left on social issues.“He’s trying to exclude a lot of people. I don’t think that’s liberal at all,” the 42-year-old said.Though a registered Republican, Williams will not be voting for Trump.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.), a candidate for the U.S. Senate, suggested that President Barack Obama is backing her opponent, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, because the president and Harris are both black.In an interview in Spanish on a Sacramento affiliate of Univision on Friday, Sanchez was asked to explain why Obama endorsed Harris.“I think they have, what he said they have, is a friendship of many years. She is African American, as is he. They know each other through meetings,” Sanchez said, according to a translation by the Los Angeles Times.Harris’ father is of Jamaican extraction and her mother is from India. Sanchez said in a statement to the Times that the remarks were not meant “to imply that President Obama endorsed Kamala Harris for racial reasons.” “I was stating the fact that the endorsement was based on their long-term political relationship,” Sanchez added.But Harris’ campaign used the comments to attack Sanchez, with Juan Rodriguez, Harris’ campaign manager, telling the Times it was “especially disappointing to see a Democratic member of Congress make those comments.”Some Californians were not impressed with Sanchez’s explanation of her remarks.It also garnered criticism from progressive activists and observers outside the state:Sanchez has gotten in trouble before over remarks that were perceived as insensitive to particular ethnic groups. In March 2015, the Orange County congresswoman made a stereotypical Native American chanting gesture when joking about her confusion ahead of a meeting with Indian Americans. Harris currently leads Sanchez in the Senate race by a 15-point margin, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average. California has a so-called jungle primary system in which candidates from all parties compete in one open race. The two candidates who perform best go on to the general election, even if they identify with the same party, as is the case with Harris and Sanchez.Harris has picked up the support of top Democratic elected officials, labor unions and progressive groups, while Sanchez has positioned herself as the more moderate choice. For example, Sanchez, unlike Harris, has refused to rule out support for cuts in Social Security benefits.In a state as liberal as California, Sanchez is expected to pick up the votes of Republicans who view her as the least bad option. Hugh Hewitt, a popular conservative talk radio host from Orange County, endorsed Sanchez for that very reason earlier this month."
15,POLITICS,Progressives Mount Fight To Abolish Superdelegates Ahead Of DNC,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fight-to-abolish-super-delegates-dnc_us_57938d06e4b01180b52f309c,"They lost in the rules committee, but they'll get another shot on the convention floor.",2016-07-23,Florida congresswoman and Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has elicited the ire of activists who believe party rules are undemocratic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57938dfb2400002700b32ac4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of Democratic officials proposed an amendment at a party Rules Committee meeting in Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon, ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which begins there on Monday.The effort suggests that while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, the grassroots anger at the party establishment that fueled his rise remains strong. The battle over reforming an unpopular party rule that allows for superdelegates ― or party officials and insiders ― to support a presidential candidate regardless of state voters’ wishes will be a key test of the strength of this ascendant progressive faction.The amendment failed in a 108 to 58 vote. But since at least 25 percent of the Democratic National Convention Rules Committee voted for the amendment, its backers can file a “minority report” that will allow it to come for a full vote among all the convention delegates.Rhode Island State Rep. Aaron Regunberg (D-Providence), the Rules Committee member who introduced the amendment, said at a press conference on Saturday morning that supporters were “not going to be satisfied until we’re able to bring this for a national vote.” A subsequent compromise amendment that would have curbed the power of superdelegates and precluded lobbyists from becoming unpledged delegates was defeated by a similar margin.Rep. Sheila Jackson (D-Texas) argued against abolishing superdelegates on the grounds that it would hamper diversity among the party’s delegates. The superdelegate process helped guarantee a voice for even the lowest-level Democratic officials across the country, she said. “That is opportunity, that is diversity,” Jackson added.Activists opposed to superdelegates argued that the opposite was true. Lillian Sharpley of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, claimed at Saturday’s committee meeting that the pool of pledged delegates is actually more diverse than the superdelegates.Other opponents of the amendments argued that the superdelegate process might be flawed, but it was not the time or the place to enact major reforms.“Rushing to judgment, especially at a time when emotions are running high, is not the right way to” reform the nominating process, said former Delegate Donna Christian-Christensen (D-U.S.V.I.) .As speakers on both sides of the issue came forward to make their case, dozens of activists who support ending superdelegates could be heard chanting outside the meeting door. “One person, one vote, superdelegates have got to go!” they said.Former Sanders supporters ― including his delegates ― have clearly played an influential role in organizing the effort to abolish superdelegates.Sanders often complained about the undemocratic role that superdelegates played in the nominating process, even if they did not ultimately overturn the will of rank-and-file voters. He noted, for example, that hundreds of superdelegates endorsed Clinton before the Vermont progressive had even announced his candidacy.But the organizers made clear on Saturday that their initiative had broad support among party activists and bigwigs alike. Groups including MoveOn.org, Daily Kos and Demand Progress collected some 750,000 petition signatures in favor of eliminating superdelegates.And the progressive coalition is even touting the support of Clinton supporters typically considered members of the party’s pro-business wing, like Simon Rosenberg, president of the NDN Network, and Joe Trippi, former campaign manager for former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.The proponents of eliminating superdelegates may have gotten a boost on Friday when leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee show party officials openly mocking the Sanders campaign, including his backers’ efforts to eliminate superdelegates. Donna Brazile, DNC vice chair for civic engagement and voter participation, called a resolution by the Maine Democratic delegation in favor of getting rid of superdelegates “another lunacy.”The revelations have bolstered a perception among Democratic activists that party officials and elites tried to rig the outcome of the nominating process.Maine State Rep. Diane Russell (D-Portland), a Sanders delegate who led the Maine effort mentioned in Brazile’s email, insisted at Saturday’s press conference that reforming the process need not be about backing a particular candidate.“This isn’t about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, this is about the nominating process,” Russell said.“One person should have one vote. This is creating an unnecessary class divide in our party.”Democratic Party officials and Clinton supporters reached compromises with Sanders backers on many provisions on the official platform, resulting in more progressive language on Social Security expansion, support for the $15 minimum wage and creating a public health care option.But when asked whether reform advocates would accept a similar compromise on super delegates, Regunberg said the change was not up for negotiation.“We want to make sure in future nominating processes that it is one person, one vote,” he said.He dismissed concerns that a national floor flight would taint the convention with the kind of discord that marred the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week.“I can’t think of a better step as far as uniting our party … than passing this resolution,” Regunberg said. “Having this conversation on the floor is a good thing.”This story has been updated to include new details and comments, including the process and outcome of the amendment vote."

Trump backers at the Republican National Convention this week told HuffPost that they love Mexican food, though some expressed concerns that it might be prepared by undocumented immigrants.Vietnam War veteran Arthur Jones, 70, traveled from Chicago to wave a banner at Public Square near the convention site reading “President Trump, Build The Wall.” He said he feared losing his country to a “Third-World invasion.” Jones added that he had “nothing against Mexicans, per se,” and that his wife “works with a lady of Hispanic descent.” Asked to describe Mexican-Americans’ greatest contributions to the United States, Jones said: “Drugs, crime, illegitimacy.” Pressed to think of something positive, Jones added: “I like tacos.” Hispanic politicians and immigrant rights activists have lashed out at Trump since last summer, when he launched his presidential campaign by painting Mexican immigrants in broad strokes as “rapists” who are “bringing crime” and drugs. He promised to build a “big, beautiful wall” along the length of the U.S. southern border and make Mexico pay for it.All the Trump supporters interviewed in Cleveland said they had immigration concerns, though most offered more sympathetic views of Mexican immigrants than Jones.Some 34.6 million people of Mexican heritage live in the U.S. Roughly two-thirds of them are U.S. citizens, and only about 16 percent are undocumented. Immigration from Mexico has declined since the 2008 economic crisis to the point that more Mexicans are leaving the U.S. than are coming here, according to the Pew Research Center.No matter how hardened their position against immigration, interviews with Trump supporters consistently revealed a soft spot for Mexican cuisine. Some viewed Mexican food as part of their regional identity.Many cities along the U.S.-Mexico border are among the safest in the nation. But Hoss Winters, a truck driver from Phoenix, said he’d been told at times by local law enforcement to stay out of some areas near the border because of cartel activity. During stops along the border, he’d walked into the neighboring Mexican cities of Juárez, Nuevo Laredo and Tijuana. He said he disliked them all, describing them as mired by corruption and crime. “The border towns [in Mexico] are garbage, just like on our side,” Winters, 37, said.But he did like one thing about those travels. “I love Mexican food,” Winters said. “How can I live in the Southwest and not?” Don Manen, a GOP alternate delegate from Texas who lives in the Rio Grande Valley, likewise viewed Mexican cuisine as part of his heritage. As a border resident, he said he favored Trump’s wall idea because he was concerned about security. “I’ve got nothing against Mexicans,” Manen said, noting that he had several undocumented friends, whom he described as “hard-working.”One of Manen’s favorite dishes is beef fajitas. “I love it,” he said. “I’m a Texan.” Bob and Marion Auray, retirees who split their time between Scottsdale, Arizona, and Pittsburgh, showed their support of Trump with baseball caps bearing his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”But having lived in Arizona among immigrants, some of whom lacked legal status, they sympathized more with undocumented folk than with the candidate they’re backing. They described Trump’s hard-line stance on immigration as “tough” and indelicately communicated.“That’s not to say that we agree how the message was said, but we agree with the message,” Marion Auray said. “We eat a lot of nachos and stuff,” she added. “A little bit of everything.” Asked to say the first three words that come to his mind when he hears the word “Mexico,” college student Devin Conway, 21, said: “Cartels. Oppression. Culture.” But Conway, waving a blue flag bearing Trump’s campaign slogan, described his experience with undocumented immigrants as largely positive. He especially admired his editor at the school paper ― who is undocumented and criticizes Conway’s support of Trump ― as exceptionally industrious. “Not to stereotype them, but I think they actually are very hard workers,” Conway said of undocumented immigrants. “They have a sort of quiet dignity. They’re more willing to work with their hands to support their families.” “We love their food,” Conway went on. “It’s become a huge part of our culture.” Enjoying Mexican food allows people who might otherwise feel prejudiced against Mexicans to rationalize their aversion as something other than racism, said O.C. Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano, the author of Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America. “Everyone hates Mexicans, but everyone at the same time loves Mexican food,” Arellano said. “When they’re eating it, they’re able to disassociate it from the people who made it, or who picked it or slaughtered those cows.”Still, Arellano welcomed the gustatory enthusiasm. “They’re sowing the seeds of their own destruction,” Arellano said. “We’ve already conquered your stomach. That’s the beachfront we just won. Next step, we’re going after your heart. That’s been a long, arduous process, but hopefully it will happen as well.”Trump himself appears to share a fondness for Mexican food. He tweeted a widely shared photo of himself eating a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo.Some Trump supporters, like Robert Bigelow of Cincinnati, do think about who makes their food. Authentic Mexican dishes are hard to find in Ohio, but Bigelow got a taste for it when his truck routes sent him through the Texas border zone.“That’s good food, because they got Mexicans cooking it,” Bigelow said. “The legal ones.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

In addition, he was a Black Hawk crew chief, a corporal in the United States Marines and also completed three tours of duties in Iraq. Matt relentlessly showed others good through his own actions ... The love of his life, however, was his family. Matt was an amazing husband, son, father and a friend.”Gerard’s funeral was held five days after a gunman opened fire in Baton Rouge, killing Gerard, Baton Rouge Officer Montrell Jackson, 32, and Brad Garafola, 45, of the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office. Three other officers were wounded.The gunman, identified by police as Gavin Long, a former Marine from Missouri who authorities say targeted the officers, was fatally shot by a SWAT team.“There is no doubt whatsoever that these officers were intentionally targeted and assassinated,” Col. Michael Edmonson, superintendent of the Louisiana State Police, said Monday. “It was a calculated act.”Garafola will be buried on Saturday. Jackson’s funeral is set for Monday.In the days before the Louisiana shootings, demonstrators had been demanding justice for victims of police brutality, particularly Alton Sterling, who was killed here on July 5.Two days later, a sniper killed five law enforcement officers at a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas, citing revenge for recent police shootings as a motive.The day after police killed Sterling, a 37-year-old father of five, an officer shot and killed Philando Castile, 32, during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. The shootings of both black men were caught on videos that were widely shared, and sparked renewed calls for reforming police use of force and the criminal justice system.During Gerard’s funeral, Chief Dabadie expressed frustration at media reports critical of his agency’s handling of protestors.“The media has blasted us for what we do and how we do it,” Dabadie said. “Basically, portraying law enforcement as these bunch of bullies who go around and beat people up … We’re not bullies. We’re protecting our communities and they’re throwing us under the bus for it and that’s wrong.”Also speaking at Friday’s service was Kip Holden, mayor-president of East Baton Rouge Parish, who asked everyone to set aside their differences and join together.“A community in mourning should evaluate itself and say, ‘What else can I do to make my community better,’” Holden said. “The men and women who don that uniform are here for all of us.”Gerald’s wife, Dechia, who attended the funeral with daughters Dawclyn and Fynleigh, did not speak at the funeral. However, she did write a letter, which was distributed to mourners. In it, she said her husband was driven to become a police officer, something she supported and felt made their marriage stronger.“Ultimately, the only thing stronger than his love for the red, white and blue was his love for us,” she wrote."

The girl remained in the back seat until 3:30 p.m. on a day when temperatures outside reached 97 degrees.By the time the woman came back to the vehicle, the girl was unconscious. She later died in the hospital.The relationship between the woman and the girl is unclear. The Williamsport police could not be reached for comment.An excessive heat warning is in effect over the weekend for much of the country, including parts of Pennsylvania.Temperatures inside cars can skyrocket faster than many people realize. This chart from the American Veterinary Medical Association (since hot cars are also a major hazard to pets) shows that even when the outside air temperature is only 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature inside a car can reach nearly 90 degrees within 10 minutes, and nearly 100 degrees within 20 minutes.And hot temperatures are riskier for kids than adults, since a child’s smaller body can heat up three to five times faster than an adult’s, Kate Carr, CEO of the nonprofit Safe Kids Worldwide, told Parents.com. Once a child’s body temperature reaches 104 degrees, major organs can begin to shut down.“Deaths from heatstroke in cars have occurred 11 months of the year in nearly every state in the country,” Carr told the outlet."
28,POLITICS,The Feds Almost Used A Pesticide That's Harmful To Pregnant Women To Combat Zika In Puerto Rico,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-zika-pesticide_us_5792af47e4b01180b52f1b94,Oops.,2016-07-23,Top U.S. officials were urging Puerto Rico earlier this week to strongly consider aerial spraying to prevent further spread of mosquito-borne Zika. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In an effort to combat the spreading Zika virus, the federal government came close to spraying a pesticide across Puerto Rico that is highly toxic and presents the most danger to pregnant women.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went so far as to ship the insecticide called Naled, which belongs to the organophosphate family, to Puerto Rico without notifying the commonwealth. Documented cases of the virus increase weekly; the island now has 5,582 Zika cases, and 662 women pregnant women are infected, according to the Puerto Rican Health Department. In May, the island reported the first microcephaly case to be acquired in the U.S. Despite the growing concerns over Zika ― and Congress leaving for the summer without funding the nation’s response ― Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla decided on Friday against using Naled. Padilla confronted the CDC earlier in the week, questioning why he was not alerted to the shipment, and sent a team to ensure the pesticide was secure once he discovered where it was being stored on the island. It was a hard decision for the governor, but opposition to the use of the pesticide was widespread in the commonwealth, and the incident reminded many residents of when the federal government used Puerto Ricans as unwitting participants in contraceptive testing in the 1950s, and when in 1992 the U.S. Navy dropped napalm on part of the island. With Zika spreading rapidly in Puerto Rico, the CDC and EPA backed the use of Naled to kill mosquitoes carrying the virus, warning that it’s only a matter of time before the commonwealth sees more babies born with birth defects. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist with environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, warned that Naled is a neurotoxin and “among the class of the most toxic pesticides.” Those most at risk to its effects are pregnant women, Sass said, meaning Naled would damage the neurological development of fetuses. Sass added that recent studies have shown spraying pesticides in the same chemical class as Naled, even at “legally allowed exposure” levels, is “definitely not safe during early brain development.”“The bottom line is that drenching our homes and communities with harmful pesticides will not address Zika,” Sass said. Using Naled too freely, Sass said, would also build up resistance, which would be detrimental in the long run in the fight against the virus. Currently, Puerto Rico is using a multi-pronged approach, including traps to capture and kill adult female mosquitoes. The island is also weighing the introduction of genetically modified male sterile mosquitoes to curb the population.After Padilla announced he would not give the OK to use Naled, opting for the organic larvicide Bti instead, the CDC said it would respect his decision. “CDC respects the decision of the Governor of Puerto Rico to not pursue aerial spraying with the insecticide Naled,” the agency said in a statement. “We regret that the shipment of Naled arrived in Puerto Rico without appropriate levels of awareness. We moved too quickly in our urgency to do all that we could to be responsive and prepared in the event officials in Puerto Rico decided to use Naled.”The CDC added that under no circumstances would it have started aerial spraying of the pesticide without authorization from the Puerto Rican government, and it will continue to support the commonwealth with “comprehensive vector control.”"

Within the red circle is a huge bulge, or X-shaped mass of stars, at the center of the galaxy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579284142a00002d004f6128.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What started out as a map of the galaxy that an astronomer shared on Twitter led to a collaboration that found strong evidence of a huge X-shaped structure formed by stars at the core of the Milky Way, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Dustin Lang, an astronomer at the University of Toronto’s Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, tweeted an image from a website he created last year using data obtained by NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer space telescope, or WISE, which surveyed the entire sky in 2010. The following image shows, at left, the WISE space telescope during its 2009 assembly at the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Logan, Utah. At right, an illustration of the telescope as it surveyed the entire sky in infrared.Lang’s tweet showing an image of the WISE sky was spotted by Melissa Ness of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.“Scientists on Twitter often share sneak peeks of interesting results or pretty pictures,” Lang said, according to CNN. When Ness saw Lang’s sky view on Twitter, she noticed something special about a group of stars at the center of the galaxy that form a bulge shape.“It was simply the most fantastic image of the Milky Way bulge that I had seen,” Ness said. “I studied the bulge for my Ph.D. and so was well aware that there are numerous works and data that demonstrate that there is an underlying X-shape in the bulge. But with that image that Dustin had made, we were clearly seeing this X-shape directly in a real image of the inner region of the galaxy for the first time.” A few weeks after they shared emails about the significance of the X-spot, Lang and Ness met at a conference in the U.S. and embarked on a real study of the X grouping of stars.Their collaborative results are in the July issue of The Astronomical Journal.In order to reveal the actual X shape at the galaxy’s center, the scientists used original WISE imagery “and subtracted a model of how stars would be distributed in a symmetrical bulge,” according to NASA.

The following image shows, at left, the WISE space telescope during its 2009 assembly at the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Logan, Utah. At right, an illustration of the telescope as it surveyed the entire sky in infrared.Lang’s tweet showing an image of the WISE sky was spotted by Melissa Ness of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.“Scientists on Twitter often share sneak peeks of interesting results or pretty pictures,” Lang said, according to CNN. When Ness saw Lang’s sky view on Twitter, she noticed something special about a group of stars at the center of the galaxy that form a bulge shape.“It was simply the most fantastic image of the Milky Way bulge that I had seen,” Ness said. “I studied the bulge for my Ph.D. and so was well aware that there are numerous works and data that demonstrate that there is an underlying X-shape in the bulge. But with that image that Dustin had made, we were clearly seeing this X-shape directly in a real image of the inner region of the galaxy for the first time.” A few weeks after they shared emails about the significance of the X-spot, Lang and Ness met at a conference in the U.S. and embarked on a real study of the X grouping of stars.Their collaborative results are in the July issue of The Astronomical Journal.In order to reveal the actual X shape at the galaxy’s center, the scientists used original WISE imagery “and subtracted a model of how stars would be distributed in a symmetrical bulge,” according to NASA. The remaining X leftovers are seen in the following image:“There was controversy about whether the X-shaped structure existed,” Lang said in a University of Toronto statement. “But our paper gives a good view of the core of our own galaxy.

Drumpf is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Canadians entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out exactly what the hell is going on. It is clear there is a great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Canadian population. On Wednesday July 20, for example, a Canadian by the name of Rafael “Canada Ted” Cruz, Jr. entered the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland and unloaded what many witnesses described as a “huge dump on the stage.”How the Republican Party allowed the notorious “Canada Ted” into the arena is a mystery—especially as this is the same America-hater who had previously cost the US economy $24 billion when he successfully shut down the entire government following a similar stunt in Washington DC.The failing New York Times will criticize me for saying this, but I’ll say it anyway: CANADA IS NOT SENDING US THEIR BEST! THEY’RE BIEBERS. THEY’RE ROGENS. And once they get here, we have no effective way to track or identify them, unless they inadvertently say “eh” at the end of a sentence. Once they are in this country, Canadians are notorious for disappearing off the radar screen and just when you wonder what they might be up to, they spring a terrifying surprise on the nation, like Ryan Reynolds did with “Deadpool.”We simply cannot allow Political Correctness to prevent us from speaking out against the harmful activities of Canadians lurking in our midst. They may look like us. They may seem to blend in. For example, I know either Edward Norton or Ryan Gosling is Canadian, but I always forget which one.Even in God-fearing Indiana, where my running mate Mike Pence has dedicated himself to waging war on the rights of women and the LGBT and Q community, the “Secretly Canadian” record label continues to operate openly.And here’s a hypothetical: What would happen if a judge with Canadian parents were ever to try a case in which a prominent billionaire and reality TV star was alleged to have scammed a few Canadians out of their life savings?No way could you trust a hater Canadian judge to give the defendant a fair trial!Maybe it’s just me, but I can’t help believing that Canadians are starting to hate us. For that reason, until we can determine and understand the Canadian problem and the dangerous threat it poses WE MUST IMMEDIATELY BAN CANADIANS FROM ENTERING THIS COUNTRY! – Donald J. Drumpf (with no help from Meredith McIver!)"

34,FIFTY,Why I'm Reluctant To Wear A Bikini Now That I'm Older,"Iris Ruth Pastor, ContributorSlice-of-life columnist, motivational speaker and pod caster, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/older-women-bikini_b_11016378.html,I really think I've got enough to worry about as the number of birthday candles on my cake soon reaches 69.

First it's adjusting to the sagging pouches of skin adorning each side of my mouth -- then it's the dark circles under my eyes. Add to that, cocoa brown age spots on my checks and slight loss of hair follicles on the right side of my forehead and more significant loss on the crown of my head. And that's only from the neck up.I really think I've got enough to worry about: Terrorist attacks. Airport security. The upcoming conventions. The Zika virus. Freak thunderstorms killing campers. But here's another little tidbit to stress about in the summer months: BIKINIS.Bikinis didn't hit American shores until the 1960's -- about the same time I was a teenager. I admit I bought my share of gingham, velour, and wildly printed skimpy tops and bottoms. But somehow, over the years, childbearing and child rearing relegated my bikinis to the Goodwill Box. And even though I pride myself on keeping up with trends, I never realized the ubiquitous bikini was still a viable option for my age-banded group. Apparently not all us aging baby boomers are embracing more modest swim attire -- many are still wrapping themselves in strings and things. Shocking.After all, I reason, what woman over 50 would even have a strong enough streak of masochism to propel her to the bathing suit rack in the first place -- much less into the dressing room? In the privacy of my own bedroom, I peruse catalogs showcasing models with flawless bodies flaunting the newest abbreviated staple in swimwear. It's hard to take. And who are these people kidding? What sane, functioning woman over 50 would expose herself to the shocking reality of seeing her tush, midriff, back of thighs, front of thighs, upper arms and shoulders fully exposed in front of the mirror? And how about the public scrutiny of actually wearing a garment the size of a Cracker Jack box outside the confines of her home? It seems I am in the minority. Not only is the bare-it-all bathing suit embraced by young women my nieces' ages, but it's being embraced by those women who were in junior high school when The Beatles debuted on the Ed Sullivan Show. My contemporaries.Okay, I understand that liposuction, breast implants and the fitness trend has sculpted many middle-aged female bodies so they appear more trim and slim than their mothers and grandmothers did at their same age. But a bikini?I have a creeping reluctance to expose my body to the world. I want a little cover. A little mystery. A little protection. A little help. A little skirt.But I'm not turning away from all trendy apparel. Tummy-tucking, oversized undies are making a ubiquitous entrance into the undergarment fashion scene. Sarah Thomkins, of British retailer Marks and Spencer, called these briefs ""flattering for the tums and buns."" And I intend to buy those little buggers by the truck full.Too bad I can't wear one under a leopard print bikini or even under an orange crocheted one. Come to think of it, maybe I can. I could call is ""a girdled bikini brief"" and the brief itself could come in different flesh tones. Perhaps it will start a hot, new trend among the baby-boomers-who-think-they-will-never-get-old group.PS: A French engineer invented the bikini in 1946 while running his mother's lingerie business. He named his new swimsuit design the bikini, in hopes that its revealing style would create an ""explosive commercial and cultural reaction"" similar to the 1946 nuclear explosion at Bikini Atoll -- an island that is part of the Marshall Islands. When I learned this fact, I almost lost my cookies. In light of today's ever mounting terrorist attacks and escalating worldwide violence, it's hard to imagine any designer capitalizing on nuclear bombing power to sell an article of clothing.

This city on the Tagus, one of the oldest in Western Europe, was originally settled as a Phoenician trading post. It was in the 15th and 16th centuries, though, that Lisbon flourished. Awe-inspiring landmarks were constructed during this Golden Age of Discovery -- the Jerónimos Monastery and the Tower of Belém, for example, and, on the waterfront, the Praca do Comercio.Stepping through the triumphal arch onto this immense plaza, Lief and I paused without meaning to. The enormity of the space and the height and grandeur of the structures on three sides around you almost take your breath away when you face them for the first time.""Imagine what it must have been like to be here, standing on this spot, 500 years ago,"" Lief said, looking slowly up, then down the waterfront before us.""Imagine the activity ... the trade ... the money ..."" he trailed off.From that spot, 500 years ago, Lisbon carried its culture to the four corners of the globe, colonizing Asia, South America, Africa, and the Atlantic islands, and then it carried back from these far-flung territories great wealth, much of which was invested in the betterment of what became one of the most glorious cities of its age.Lisbon became Lisbon thanks to its strategic geographic position at the mouth of the Tagus River. According to a popular fado, Lisbon has always been in love with her river ... because the river is the city's lifeline to the sea... and Portugal very much identifies herself with the sea.""We have a word in Portuguese,"" a new friend here, Miguel, told me today, ""that doesn't exist in any other language as far as I know.""The word is saudade.

It comes with the territory.""Most of the world looks at Portugal as the edge of Europe,"" Miguel continued. ""We Portuguese look at the world map and see ourselves right at the center ... at the heart.""For us, the sea is part of our territory ... a continuation of our domain ... so, for us, Portugal is quite expansive ...""As I'm getting to know it better, I'm realizing that Portugal is a small country with a colorful history and a big romantic heart.Lisbon, which I'm becoming acquainted with for the first time this trip, is a noble and elegant city whose centuries-old, pastel-colored stone structures are bordered by jacaranda trees and set off by formal gardens and parks with elaborate fountains. Roads, walkways, and pavements are laid with small cobblestones in contrasting colors to create elaborate patterns and sea scenes that are like works of art, almost mosaics.From her early-morning rainbow on my bedroom wall to her winding patterned cobblestoned streets, Lisbon is getting under my skin. I feel an attachment starting.Lisbon has a lot to offer the visitor but hasn't historically been a major tourist destination compared with other European capitals. This appears to be changing. In 2015 Lisbon saw more than 3 million tourists.With parks, gardens, museums, palaces, significant architectural landmarks, the river, the ocean, and all that history, Lisbon should be on everyone's Grand Tour list. All those amenities also make this city a great option for living, which is why it is attracting more and more expats and retirees, not only from the U.K., whose pensioners have recognized the appeals for decades, but also from across Europe and increasingly from across the world, including China and, most recently, North America.While I've been entranced by Lisbon's romantic history, Lief has been focused on understanding the city's present-day real estate market. Values are up 20 percent over the past year in certain districts ... and they continue up.""As a result,"" Joao told us, ""some sections of the city are over-priced in my opinion. These are the areas where everyone has been focused. There is only so much inventory, and now buyers are fighting over it. I say leave those areas alone for now.""The opportunities for real estate investment in central Lisbon right now are many, varied, and compelling. This is a big area made up of many distinct neighborhoods.The heart of downtown and a key tourist zone is the area inland from the Praça do Comércio. Just west of here is Chiado, a high-end neighborhood. Baixa is a commercial district with shop-lined streets.Lief and I particularly enjoyed the area around Jardim do Principe Real, which we found charming, a place we could see ourselves spending time long-term.Distinct neighborhoods, each with its own look, feel, and character, but all interesting as locations for investment, both short and long-term. With so many areas of opportunity, your challenge as a property investor is narrowing your search zone. If you're looking for a great value, focus on areas outside the ""best"" neighborhoods -- though it is still possible to find a decent renovation project for a great-undervalued price, even in those top districts. I don't think this will be true for too much longer. Real estate in Lisbon continues to build momentum.""I know one section of the city, for example, on the river that has a great deal to offer but where values are still very low because so far no one has been paying any attention,"" Joao asserts, ""I'll take you there tonight for drinks...""Original feature: The Romantic Past And Promising Future Of Lisbon, PortugalRelated Articles:Portugal Is The Total Package For Retirement and MoreHistory And Culture In Lisbon, PortugalHere's Why Tourism In Portugal Is On The RiseEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

In 2015 Lisbon saw more than 3 million tourists.With parks, gardens, museums, palaces, significant architectural landmarks, the river, the ocean, and all that history, Lisbon should be on everyone's Grand Tour list. All those amenities also make this city a great option for living, which is why it is attracting more and more expats and retirees, not only from the U.K., whose pensioners have recognized the appeals for decades, but also from across Europe and increasingly from across the world, including China and, most recently, North America.While I've been entranced by Lisbon's romantic history, Lief has been focused on understanding the city's present-day real estate market. Values are up 20 percent over the past year in certain districts ... and they continue up.""As a result,"" Joao told us, ""some sections of the city are over-priced in my opinion. These are the areas where everyone has been focused. There is only so much inventory, and now buyers are fighting over it. I say leave those areas alone for now.""The opportunities for real estate investment in central Lisbon right now are many, varied, and compelling. This is a big area made up of many distinct neighborhoods.The heart of downtown and a key tourist zone is the area inland from the Praça do Comércio. Just west of here is Chiado, a high-end neighborhood. Baixa is a commercial district with shop-lined streets.Lief and I particularly enjoyed the area around Jardim do Principe Real, which we found charming, a place we could see ourselves spending time long-term.Distinct neighborhoods, each with its own look, feel, and character, but all interesting as locations for investment, both short and long-term. With so many areas of opportunity, your challenge as a property investor is narrowing your search zone. If you're looking for a great value, focus on areas outside the ""best"" neighborhoods -- though it is still possible to find a decent renovation project for a great-undervalued price, even in those top districts. I don't think this will be true for too much longer. Real estate in Lisbon continues to build momentum.""I know one section of the city, for example, on the river that has a great deal to offer but where values are still very low because so far no one has been paying any attention,"" Joao asserts, ""I'll take you there tonight for drinks...""Original feature: The Romantic Past And Promising Future Of Lisbon, PortugalRelated Articles:Portugal Is The Total Package For Retirement and MoreHistory And Culture In Lisbon, PortugalHere's Why Tourism In Portugal Is On The RiseEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

REUTERS/Mike Segar",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8219a2500008e013a17d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The political task for everyone on the left (and a lot of other people) is to defeat Trump. But how? Now ""how"" as in ""which tactics will beat him"" - though that's important! - but ""how"" as in: What kind of country will we have if we defeat him? How will we, the people who won, find a way to live with his supporters in the aftermath? Here are a few opening thoughts about the political ethics of fighting Trump.1. Don't Identify his Supporters with him.Trump - Trump the candidate; who knows or cares about the man, if he's in there? - is a liar, bigot, xenophobe, strong man, and bully who plays on anti-elitist resentment, economic abandonment, and wounded white privilege like a maestro. He is putting a white, nationalist, populist identity politics at the heart of the presidential election.Opponents of Trump should struggle to avoid calling his supporters racists, xenophobes, etc., to avoid addressing them as members of a white identity movement. No doubt some of them at the core of his support already are these things, and need to be fought as such; but many are not, really, or only a little bit and usually in private. But in politics people tend to become what they are addressed as being. That is what makes Trump's rancid populism so dangerous: it starts from the multifarious stew of political sentiment and brews up something specific and especially toxic. The hope has to be that, when he is gone, most of his supporters will become something else, not double down on this season's Trumpist themes. The alternative is to find a way to live with a generation of open white identity movements in American politics. That's not a problem anyone should want. Attacks that identify Trump supporters with his ugly qualities tend to ratify his claim that he is their voice, as he put it in his RNC speech. If people believe that, we fact a long and nasty fight against Trumpism, even if he loses in November. The less they believe he is their voice, the sooner the air can clear and something different can happen.2. Don't Blame Democracy.Some elite commentators have argued that Trump's success shows the problems inherent in democracy: self-indulgent voters susceptible to flattery, irrational passions and prejudices sweeping the public square. There are many reasons not to accept this diagnosis of Trump, but here's the simplest. Trump himself palpably has no regard for democracy. He sees it as just another marketing medium, a chance to collect votes and applause as he collects cash and publicity in his other enterprises. Trump regards voters as customers, not citizens, and his business record gives plenty of evidence that he regards customers as suckers.Trump is not democracy's harvest. He's the rotten fruit of oligarchy. Our hyper-capitalist and celebrity-happy culture cultivates the fantasy that rich people are our betters, natural rulers, brilliant and inherently interesting. Trump is the extreme version of that money-culture deformation of democracy. His version fills the populist wing of the Republicans, while the big-donor Citizens United version fills the Jeb Bush wing.If we beat Trump, there's going to be plenty of temptation to recoil from the democracy that gave him his votes. Pundits will say that populism as such is a threat to political decency, and that democracy is a problem for wise elites to manage, not a source of legitimacy and an ethical imperative. We need to resist this. Trump is fundamentally an anti-democratic figure, with no respect for ideas of civic equality or responsible self-rule. His ""I am your voice"" is self-branding, self-marketing narcissist's version of strongman politics. If we defeat him but allow him to define what democracy means around here, democratic principles will be the losers.3. Hold the Left.Trump name-checked Bernie Sanders during his RNC speech. Of course he did: Trump has the bully's instinct for dividing his opponents. He would love to collect some Sanders supporters in November; but even more, he would love to turn Sanders's principled social-democratic campaign, which was opposed to every part of the oligarchic and exclusionary America Trump celebrates, into a caricature of itself, a bunch of angry people, like the ones at his rallies, but with less beer and more weed. Hillary Clinton's pick of moderate Tim Kaine as her running mate confirms that she and the rest of the Democratic establishment have no interest in keeping alive Sanders's drive for economic security, stronger democracy, and a society where solidarity has a fighting chance against anxious self-interest. They would like his voters, but, as was abundantly clear all along, his politics is not theirs, and will not be. They will run as responsible managers of the economy, stewards of a familiar liberal-hawk American foreign policy, and people who believe in government, but not in ways that would threaten their donors.It's important to remember what the Sanders campaign was for: an economy that is less divided and frightening to navigate, a government more responsive and accountable - in short, a country that is more democratic and less alienating. Defeating Trump shouldn't turn into defending the system he is attacking. His attacks are opportunistic, and a Trump victory would make things worse, especially for the most vulnerable. But he is succeeding, in part, because there is so much that should be better. The left should emerge from this fight with a program that speaks to the young people who went overwhelmingly for Sanders, the older and non-white voters who tended to Clinton, and those of Trump's supporters who are not essentially misogynists and bigots, and really do hope to see a better country. Better or worse, we will all be sharing it. No political victory can change the difficult fact of being stuck here together, which is why we have politics in the first place."

The last gasp of Atatürk has breathed new life into Erdoğan's troubled and troubling tenure.Oxford scholar Azeem Ibrahim credits the development of Turkey's vibrant civil society and economy to the secular Kemalist vision and the stability secured over the years by the military and judiciary. ""But the failed coup ... marks an end to all that,"" he writes. ""And this may very well be the end of the Kemalist Turkish Republic.""In an interview, Yusuf Muftuoglu, a top advisor to former Turkish President Abdullah Gül, explains the forces behind the coup and the resistance to it. He notes the critical importance of social media, of Istanbul as a new power center for Islamists and the key role of the police in fighting the armed forces. ""Erdoğan is the biggest victor"" of the coup ""and quite deservedly,"" he concludes. ""Honestly, had there been another person at the same post, the coup might have succeeded. Erdoğan not only has shown the strong leadership to mobilize the masses against the coup plotters, which is unprecedented in Turkish history, but also, and more importantly, did so while he himself was physically targeted. ... This whole process also confirmed once again Erdoğan's seamless contact with his constituency and beyond."" In another interview, one of Turkey's leading novelists, Elif Shafak, sees her country ""heading into a Kafkaesque world"" in the wake of the coup, where everyone is suspect. ""The question hovering in the air,"" she writes, is, ""Are you one of us or are you one of them?"" She also worries that her country is now on the path to becoming an ""illiberal democracy."" ""A true democracy,"" she argues, ""needs separation of powers, rule of law, freedom of speech, women's rights, LGBT rights, free and diverse media and independent academia. Without all these institutions and values you can only have 'majoritarianism.' And majoritarianism is not the same thing as democracy."" Another Turkish novelist, Kaya Genc, describes a night of both high anxiety and relief as he roamed the streets of Istanbul with anti-coup protesters. Writing from the Menemen District far from Istanbul, Ilgin Yorulmaz talks to people about the failed coup and says her, ""pro-democracy friends support neither the coup nor autocracy.""Reporting from Istanbul, WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones takes the pulse of everyday life on the streets among the city's unsettled residents. Some are angry at the military, some at Erdoğan, she writes. ""Anything can happen at any time,"" one resident tells her. She also reports on the choice Greece faces over whether to extradite eight alleged Turkish coup plotters seeking exile in that neighboring country. Also writing from Istanbul, Behlül Özkan slams the ""kamikaze coup attempt"" that he thinks was bound to fail, but says, ""Turkey is now in the midst of a national security crisis"" and that Erdogan's tactics for holding on to power by, ""forming temporary, strategic alliances cannot solve"" it. In an interview, Can Dündar, the persecuted editor-in-chief of the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet, fears the post-coup backlash. Speaking of Erdoğan's comment that the coup was ""a gift from God,"" Dündar says, ""He will make good use of this 'gift' and start a witch hunt against all opposition by accusing them of being coup perpetrators and thereby increasing his oppression.""Turkish authorities have blamed the cleric Fethullah Gülen and his followers for fomenting the coup and demanded his extradition from exile in the U.S. James Dorsey tries to answer the question of whether Gülen is an Islamist modernizer or ""a wolf in sheep's clothing."" Graham Fuller, a former vice chairman of the CIA's National Intelligence Council once stationed in Istanbul, and whose security assessment (written in a personal capacity) helped Gülen to obtain status as a permanent resident in the U.S., offers his take on the Gulenist movement. He sees the political battle in Turkey between the AKP ruling party and Gulenists as a power struggle among two of the Muslim world's more moderate movements. And he seriously doubts Gülen had anything to do with the coup attempt. Fuller concludes that, ""Erdogan is planting the seeds of his own destruction"" through the ongoing purges aimed at the Gulenist and liberal forces. ""The country itself,"" he writes, ""is now his primary victim."" Writing from Germany, Christoph Asche says that the restoration of the death penalty in Turkey ""could kill relations"" between the two countries since European Union nations reject executions on a human rights basis. Foreign Affairs Reporter Akbar Shahid Ahmed and others explore the complex history of relations between NATO and the various democratic and military governments in Turkey over recent decades. Ahmed also writes on Donald Trump's recent NATO controversy. Referring to the backlash against Trump's remarks that Europe should share more of NATO's burden, he says, ""key anti-Trump forces are offering evidence for the Republican standard-bearer's argument ― that U.S. elites are so hung up on past commitments that they can't embrace fresh thinking."" Tunisian blogger Ramzi Houidi compares the failed coup in Turkey to the successful military coup in Egypt in 2013. The difference, he says, is that ""in Turkey, the opposition chose to democratically stand against the coup, putting the interests of the country before the party's.""France is once again reeling, this time after the Nice attack by a Tunisian immigrant that killed scores of people on Bastille Day. Former Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey argues that many ""losers"" in society, like the Tunisian attacker, turn to terrorism so they can become ""heroes."" Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed argues that more attacks on the self-proclaimed Islamic State won't end terrorism in France or Europe as a whole. Only an affirmative policy of integration of Muslims will make a difference, he says. Writing from Stuttgart, Germany, Daniel Koehler brings common sense to the fight against terrorism. ""Mothers may be the first, last and best approach to stopping militant recruiters,"" he writes. Turning to the political drama in the U.S., the Republican Party convened in Cleveland this week to nominate Donald Trump as its presidential candidate. Dean Obeidallah writes that a recent proposal by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a key speaker at the convention, to vet American Muslims over whether they believe in Sharia is a glimpse into the ""inquisition"" to come if Trump wins the presidency. Reflecting on the theme of Trump's acceptance speech Thursday that ""we should be afraid, very afraid,"" Obeidallah also lends skepticism to the nominee's credentials on security issues. ""For Trump to justify scaring us, he needs to be able to deliver on his promise to keep us safe,"" he writes.In his own assessment of Trump's speech from Cleveland, Howard Fineman thinks the American Founding Fathers would be turning in their grave. He writes that, ""they knew the history of Rome, where tribunes ― in the name of the people but often for their own purposes ― wielded vast power. They didn't think anyone had a direct pipeline to the voice of the people except the people themselves. The founders feared both the mob and the monarchy, but most of all feared an alliance of the two."" Turning to Asia, Helen Clark looks at what the recent ruling by a U.N. tribunal against China and for the Philippines means for Vietnam, which has similar territorial claims against China. Vietnam is being cautious and not celebratory, she writes, because, ""what happens next in the South China Sea won't change: it is still up to China."" Looking into the not-too-distant future when robots will be creating new wealth, but displacing jobs, Moises Naim argues we should be open to the idea of a guaranteed minimum income for all.Some things in the world are working. Google is using its DeepMind computing capacity to more efficiently regulate the flow of energy to its servers, which constitute 5 percent of the cloud.As Saudi Arabia's top clerical body renewed its fatwa against Pokemon, our Singularity series this week reports that the ""Pokemon Go"" craze is only a foretaste of our augmented reality future. But not everyone loves ""Pokemon Go."" Cavan Sieczkowski reports on what director Oliver Stone said about the game at Comic-Con this week. ""It's everywhere,"" she quotes Stone as saying. ""It's what some people call surveillance capitalism ... You'll see a new form of, frankly, a robot society where they will know how you want to behave, and they will make the mock-up that matches how you behave. It's what they call totalitarianism."" Nathalia Ramos disagrees, arguing that ""Pokemon Go"" nostalgically takes millennials back to an ""innocent"" era before 9/11 when they played a similar game as children. In yet another twist, some Syrian children are tapping in to the ""Pokemon Go"" craze to ask the world to help rescue them.MISSION STATEMENTThe WorldPost is a global media bridge that seeks to connect the world and connect the dots.

Rudy Giuliani's quadrennial temper tantrum was even more animated than during previous conventions. Ben Carson gave a speech that married his own bizarre brand of evangelical Christianity with reasoning that one might expect on a child's playground to imply that Hillary Clinton was a worshipper of Lucifer. The candidate himself painted a frightening, if based in fantasy, picture of an America under siege by roving bands of cop-killing criminals and Isis operatives. Perhaps most disturbingly of all, the Quicken Loans Arena echoed with calls to lock Hillary Clinton up and, even more appallingly, some supporters of the Republican candidate have suggested executing her for treason. This was not Ronald Reagan's morning in America, George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism or even Mitt Romney's ""We built it."" Rather, this was a convention that presented a level of vitriol, hatred, intolerance and division that we have not seen in a long time. It was very difficult to watch that convention and conclude that in the likely event of a Clinton victory in November, the people in that arena and the millions of Americans they represent, will accept defeat easily. Americans have always been proud of our ability to accept political defeat and move to fight another day. There is, however, real reason to think that will not happen this time if Clinton wins. The people in that room do not see the coming election as a hard fought campaign between two loyal Americans, but as a battle between a crooked, dishonest, criminal who should not be allowed to live freely, let alone serve as President of the United States, and a heroic figure who is the only person able to save the country. This is a dynamic that threatens the very core of our democracy. Simply put, people who call for their opponents to be arrested or killed, while imbuing their own candidate with messianic powers, do not accept political defeat easily. Moreover, the alleged more mature voices within the Republican Party who have stood by and said nothing while this all occurred are clearly unwilling or unable to moderate what could charitably be described as the angry, unhinged mob formerly known as the Republican base. It has been evident for many months now, and was made more apparent last week in Cleveland, that a Trump presidency would damage the already weak social fabric of American democracy. His enthusiasm for divisive and hateful rhetoric, tenuous understanding of key principles of American democracy such as, for example, the First Amendment, and deep-seeded megalomania are all reason that a Trump presidency would threaten our democracy and what is left of our national cohesion. However, it is now increasingly likely that a Trump defeat, even by a resounding margin, would not be met with acceptance from Trump and his supporters.The possibility that Trump would encourage his supporters not to accept this defeat, perhaps by claiming that the vote was rigged or that undocumented workers voted in droves in key southwestern states, must be gravely considered at this point. This conclusion is not simply the product of progressive paranoia, but it is a reaction to what we have seen and heard from Trump and his supporters for the last year, but even more so during the last week. Speculating about what a candidate might do if he loses is a strange exercise, and one that should have no place in a consolidated and stable democracy, if flawed, democracy like ours. However, it is something that based on the behavior of Trump and his supporters, must be considered. Throughout this long campaign we have seen Trump encourage and even advocate violent behavior, stand by while his Democratic opponent is accused of treason and murder, and evince little understanding of democratic processes or mores. The question of what this man will do if, as is still likely, he loses on November 8th, cannot be ignored given this context. Trump, should he be defeated, could easily eschew the traditional gracious concession, mobilize his supporters to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the outcome and their disbelief in his Democratic vanquisher's victory. Ultimately, however, it would be very difficult for him to stop Clinton from becoming President. Trump controls no security forces, has little institutional support and has few concrete resources other than his Twitter account, but he clearly has the enthusiastic support of enough people to create problems in the immediate aftermath of his possible defeat. Those people could easily protest for a few weeks and continue a lower level campaign of failing to recognize Clinton's presidency for years.It should also be remembered that Trump a man with a loyal following of angry citizens with an extraordinarily exaggerated sense of their own victimhood and suffering, and that he has the temperament of an acutely narcissistic middle school student. He also has built a presidential campaign heavily around overreacting, often viciously and with prejudice towards almost all, to every real, or more frequently, imagined, insult or slight he has experienced. This is not the temperament of somebody who will accept an electoral defeat move on and urge his followers to do the same. In a very real way, while seeing this man elected President of the United States should, and does, strike fear in the hearts of millions, even his defeat could create enduring problems for American democracy."
