The series spurns out a lot of interesting character portrayals, like Ron Swanson who eats an alarming amount of bacon, but Tom is easily the most unique. What really cemented our love for Tom Haverford was the episode when he shared his food slang words. (Forks are food rakes!) We know we're not the only ones who felt this way because four individuals (Elizabeth Lauren, Alyssa DeHayes, Brian Moore and Sami Promisloff) took the time to create Tom Haverfoods as a tribute. Their website, which we will warn you is insanely addictive, comes up with new Tom Haverford's food slangs. And they're spot on. If you have a good Tom Haverford creation in mind, check out the site and submit your idea. If you don't, check out the site anyway, it'll make your day a little better.

But",2012-10-24,"An Ohio Democratic Party volunteer displays a placard to encourage public for early voting in front of an early voting center in Columbus, Ohio, on October 15, 2012. Three weeks before election day, the White House race between US president Barack Obama and his Republican foe Mitt Romney remains statistically tied, with Obama maintaining just a slight advantage, a new opinion poll found Monday. AFP PHOTO/Jewel Samad (Photo credit should read JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c719c2500003200361151.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans are hoping for the best, but very much preparing for the worst come election day. Fearful of how the outcome of the presidential election will impact their wallets, 40 percent of Americans have already cut back on spending, according to a survey released today by NetCredit. The personal loan provider discovered that only about 5 percent of the 1,000 Americans polled think their paychecks will be positively impacted by the election.About 49 percent of NetCredit respondents said they're worried that their taxes will increase after the election, a reasonable concern considering that millions of Americans stand to see their paychecks cut regardless of who becomes the next president.Neither President Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney are talking about extending payroll tax cut, a temporary tax reduction that is due to quietly expire next year. Without the cut, an American making $50,000  stands to lose about $1,000 in annual pay, according to the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities. The payroll tax cut is one of a handful of tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of the year.This is unwelcome news for middle-class Americans who are struggling to rebound from the financial crisis. All middle-income earners stand to pay more under Romney's plan, according to the Tax Policy Center, a non-partistan tax think tank. Furthermore, in last week's presidential debate, Romney discussed his plan to put a cap on mortgage deductions, which could hurt homeowners where cost of living is high. While Obama has claimed that his administration would create ""not just jobs,"" but ""good-paying jobs,” the National Employment Law Project found that the very jobs capable of supporting a middle-class family are disappearing. While three-fifths of jobs lost during the recession paid middle-class wages, about three-fifths of new jobs during the recovery pay low wages. Considering the uncertainty of what's ahead, it's not surprising Americans intend to put money away for a rainy day. But given recent data, it's unlikely that Americans have much extra cash to save. Over two thirds of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, according to a survey by the American Payroll Association. A recent study by CredityDonkey.com discovered that close to half of Americans don’t have any more than $500 in their savings.Here are 10 ways your paycheck stands to take a hit in 2013:"

(AP Photo/Peter Kramer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c72e91f000050002138e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ann Coulter used only 74 of Twitter’s allotted 140 characters for her brief debate recap on Monday night -- but six of those were enough to awaken intense backlash. For parents of children with special needs, Coulter’s repeated use of the ""r-word"" cut especially close to the bone, CNN reports.The tweet in question -- “I highly approve of Romney’s decision to be kind and gentle to the retard” -- and a next-day followup, “Obama: 'Stage 3 Romneysia' - because cancer references are HILARIOUS. If he's ‘the smartest guy in the room’ it must be one retarded room” -- have been roundly condemned by Twitterers of many backgrounds and political stripes. Even Coulter’s explanation of her remark, offered to Politicker -- “The only people who will be offended are too retarded to understand it” -- is unlikely to endear her to any of them, and special needs parents have been vocal about why.In an open letter to Coulter published Tuesday on the blog ""Undiagnosed, but we are okay with that,"" mom blogger Kerri wrote: “You do not SEE those who are intellectually disabled. You only see your own agenda and how to get your name in the headlines. Doing it by insulting my daughter and others like her, that is heinous.”Actress Holly Robinson Peete -- who wrote an open letter to rapper 50 Cent this summer to protest his use of the words “autistic” and “special ed” on Twitter -- tweeted, “As a mom of a son with autism the words Retard or retarded are like nails on a chalkboard. A lot of people say it benignly esp kids...” (E! Online has rounded up more celebrity reactions to Coulter’s tweets here.)Earlier in October, when Coulter used the word “retarded” in a different election-related tweet, dad blogger Dan Niblock -- whose son Ozzie has Down syndrome -- wrote an impassioned piece for TODAY Moms about how hurtful the word can be.In the post, Niblock articulated his disappointment and anger over the use of the term: “It's a slur that demeans a lot of people who have a hard enough time getting on with the business of life without having to deal with the constant reminder that a great swath of society thinks their existence is the world’s best punch line.”“This isn’t the first time [Ann Coulter] has tweeted the word ‘retarded’ to insult her rivals, and she needs to stop,” he wrote, demanding an apology from the political commentator.Over at Love That Max, HuffPost blogger Ellen Seidman, who writes regularly about raising her son with cerebral palsy, has commented a great deal on use of the “r-word” and conducted Twitter campaigns to stop its thoughtless use.“Many people think that using the word 'retard' to slam someone is fine -- as long as it's not actually directed at a person with disability. ... What people don't understand is that every time someone uses the word 'retard,' they perpetuate the idea that people with intellectual disability, like my son, Max, are stupid or losers,” she told CNN on Tuesday.“If you wouldn't say the word to my child because you know it's offensive,” Seidman wrote on her blog in March, “you should avoid using it elsewhere, too. Either way, it's demeaning. Either way, it hurts my child.” Seidman invited commenters on Love That Max to weigh in about Coulter’s recent remarks -- and they’ve obliged.“As for free speech, of course Coulter has a right to use any word she wants,” one commenter wrote. “And I'm against any law that would forbid or punish her for doing so. But all that Ellen and others are doing is exactly what those who believe in free speech are supposed to do: Challenging speech with more speech.”When one commenter hit back with, “Don't be such a crybaby. She didn't call YOUR kid a retard. She called the retard Obama and retard!” others chimed in: “Yes, she did insult our children. When she said ‘gentle WITH the RETARD’ she was saying that people with intellectual disabilities have to be treated with kid gloves. She linked the President with people who struggle every day just to function. ... We are not crybabies. We are advocates for our children and their siblings.”“We're not trying to ban a word,” yet another commenter wrote. “It certainly is everyone's right to use the word if they wish. ... What we're hoping for as special needs individuals, parents of special needs individuals, and supporters of special needs individuals is that people will use compassion when speaking to and about others, especially those in the spotlight who exert immense power over the impressionable.”"

(Photo by Robert Giroux/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c703026000032007f7a88.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whenever there's a hurricane Katrina, a 2008 market crash, or a Deepwater Horizon oil spill, pundits hammer the point that we can't waste this tragedy. We have to use our collective fear, anger, and hope as motivation to prevent such and such disaster from ever happening again. Social Security was borne of the Great Depression, the United Nations came out of World War II, and the Environmental Protection Agency wouldn't have been created without growing awareness of various environmental crises. But we rarely apply the same principle to our personal lives. When we're at our most scared and vulnerable, we often fall back on old habits. A breakup leads to binge drinking or going back to an old, unhealthy relationship. This is a shame. What I've learned reporting The Fear Project is that fear was designed by evolution as a motivator for change, a catalyst. That change could be freezing up, it could be moving backward to an old habit, or it could be a leap toward realizing a dream. Which direction we change depends on how conscious we are of the fear and whether we decide to consciously harness fear's energy for a positive outcome. If we're not able to observe our patterns with a little objectivity -- which comes with mindfulness practice -- most likely we'll freeze or fall back on an old habit. But if we can simply notice, ""Oh, I'm afraid, this could be an opportunity,"" those terrified moments of vulnerability can be the most powerful moments in our lives, the ones that get us off our butts and move us toward the lives we want.I'm thinking about this today because I'm reading ultra athlete Rich Roll's incredible autobiography, Finding Ultra. When Roll was 40, though he had a beautiful family and a successful career as an entertainment lawyer, he wasn't happy. He was 50 pounds overweight and addicted to junk food and television -- replacements for the drug and alcohol addictions he'd had to kick years earlier. But one night after devouring too many cheeseburgers and too many episodes of Law and Order, fear struck. He checked on his sleeping children then continued upstairs to bed. There were only eight stairs, but Roll was winded, seriously winded. ""This is what I've become,"" Roll thought. It was a thought he'd probably had before, but for whatever reason, this time it triggered the fear that he might not be alive to watch his 2-year-old daughter get married. If he continued down the path he was on, there was no guarantee. Roll had been unhappy for years, but it was this brief moment of fear and the awareness that it could be used as a catalyst that changed Roll's life forever. In that precise moment, I was overcome with the profound knowledge not just that I needed to change, but that I was willing to change. From my adventures in the subculture of addiction recovery, I'd learned that trajectory of one's life often boils down to a few identifiable moments -- decisions that change everything. I knew all too well that moments like these were not to be squandered. Rather, they were to be respected and seized at all costs, for they just didn't come around that often, if ever. Even if you experienced only one powerful moment like this one, you were lucky. Blink or look away for even an instant and the door didn't just close, it literally vanished. In my case, this was the second time I'd been blessed with such an opportunity, the first being that precious moment of clarity that precipitated my sobriety in rehab. Looking into the mirror that night, I could feel that portal opening again. I needed to act.""Within two years, Roll had become one of the fittest ultra athletes on the planet, gone vegan, and, in the process, was beginning to find out who he was and what he was capable of -- as an athlete, as man, as a father.

So far, six states and Washington, D.C., have legalized same-sex marriage, but the coming election may result in a few more states -- like Washington and Maryland -- joining in. Additionally, the Democratic Party now formally supports gay marriage rights for the first time in history. It's clear that the subject of same-sex marriage is vital in this election.When discussing same-sex marriage, however, many neglect to raise the issue of same-sex divorce. Some same-sex couples get married in states where it's legal and then move to states where it's not. What happens if they decide to divorce? What are the legal requirements, and how do they affect gay couples who find themselves in this situation? Because of the variation between states, the legalities are complex.Total Divorce created an infographic to answer these questions. While the topic of marriage is extremely important in today's culture, the legal implications of same-sex divorce must be examined as well. "

Accept that you're going to wobble and fail sometimes. It's okay. The goal here, upon finding out that you've been cheated on, is to take back your power, maintain your dignity and not do anything homicidal. Here are five things you should never do after finding out that you've been cheated on:1. Do not confront the cheater until you've gathered evidence. Most cheaters will lie and gaslight you unless you catch them dead to rights, and even then they usually only cop to what they think you already know. If you confront them before you have the evidence, there's a good chance they'll take the affair more underground. Put all your evidence in a safe place. Never reveal your sources.2. Never accept responsibility for their cheating. She didn't cheat on you because of your penchant for wearing dark socks and sandals in public. He didn't find f**kbuddies on Craigslist because of your post-baby muffin top. Nor did he cheat because you're a bipolar, alcoholic shrew who emasculates him with your rages (although you sound pretty lousy as partners go). People cheat because they feel entitled to. Cheaters are 100 percent responsible for their decision to cheat. If they were unhappy, they could've gotten counseling, filed for divorce, taken up scrapbooking -- really anything other than cheating. They cheat because they value the good feelings they get from ego boosts and affair sex more than their commitment to you and your health and well-being. People cheat because they're selfish escapists. Many of them are quite happy to blame shift their crappy decisions on to you. Don't let that happen. Be very clear on what is yours to own (i.e., dark socks/sandals offenses) and what is not yours to own (i.e., f**king people you aren't married to.)3. Don't give them any time to ""decide."" Have you heard the expression, don't make anyone a priority who only makes you an option? You are not an option. You are their spouse. This is not a contest. They made a commitment to you. They don't get to renegotiate the terms. Stalling for time, acting vague about how they intend to make this right, talking a good game and never coming through on the particulars -- these are all ploys to keep them in the affair. You cannot ""nice"" someone out of an affair. ""Oh, I'll just make my needs smaller and smaller, or I'll be so wonderful I'll win them back!"" are tactics doomed to failure. All you do with appeasement is give the cheater the green light to abuse you further. The cheater needs to decide right then and there -- or you put their crap in Hefty bags and throw it on the lawn for the raccoons.4. Do not beg for your marriage. Do not cry or plead or attempt to win them over. Maintain your dignity. When you do the ""humiliating dance of ""pick me,"" all you do is feed their egos and give them your power. Now is the time to practice detachment and take care of yourself (see a lawyer, protect your assets, get support). Set aside your grief and make room for righteous anger. Let it fuel you forward. You are not anyone's consolation prize.5. Do not waste your time trying to figure them out. Seriously, people, this is a time suck. I call this stage ""Untangling the Skein of F**kupedness."" If you're like most betrayed spouses, you spend a lot of time in pointless arguments yelling at your cheater, ""WTF?! How could you do this?"" or ""Does she have some gravitational pull that you're helpless to resist?!"" or ""That fedora-headed, hipster douchebag? Really?"" You'll posit theories. You'll deconstruct their family of origin issues. You'll order a dozen infidelity books on Amazon. All this does is keep your energy focused on them. Not you. You only get to control yourself. So what do you want? Is this person someone you want to invest in? What is acceptable and unacceptable to you? And what are you going to do about it? If you're so busy trying to uncode them, or predict what they'll do next, or prevent them from doing some awful thing, you will just stay stuck. It doesn't matter why they are how they are. You can't fix it. You just get to fix you."
11,STYLE & BEAUTY,"Interview With Lope Navo, Fashion Photographer","Joseph Sutton, Contributor
Freelance Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lope-navo-fashion-photographer_us_5b9c6f81e4b03a1dcc7e9e1e,"For a man working within the mode of representation, Lope Navo seems interested primarily in the experiential and the tangible as a means for interacting with the world.",2012-10-23,2012-10-21-SupermodelTaylorFuchsforFiascoSweetSixteenbyLopeNavo03.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-10-21-SupermodelTaylorFuchsforFiascoSweetSixteenbyLopeNavo03.jpg,"Lope Navo is a fashion photographer whose credits include Esquire magazine in the Philippines, Geil magazine in Berlin, Playgirl, American Rag and others. Born in Manila, today Navo may call many probable cities his home, or no city in particular. While previously based in New York, today he travels the globe between a myriad of exotic locales.For a man working within the mode of representation, Navo seems interested primarily in the experiential and the tangible as a means for interacting with the world. In this interview, he reveals that he is less interested in what can be explored in a museum or library than those things he can touch or interact with firsthand.But it is a sense of self that Navo has been searching for, from one hemisphere to the other: ""All this time I have been trying to peel the onion to see what's in the middle. I want to know what makes my work unique,"" he says, not sounding unlike the protagonist for the novel he is currently writing, another passion of his.Our being on two opposite ends of the world, Navo and I corresponded via email for this interview.Joe Sutton: How did you get started in photography? Lope Navo: I studied photography in college. I was a fine arts major in advertising in Manila, but I focused more on painting. After college, I had a number of graphic design stints in several cities like Singapore and Dubai, and that eventually gave me the opportunity to travel to Malaysia, Thailand, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Upon my travels, I was able to take so many photos, meet interesting people and engage in different cultures. I was working for a magazine as a graphic designer when my editor noticed my work and gave me a chance to shoot an editorial for DSquared2 for Remix Magazine Dubai (a music magazine in New Zealand), and that was officially my first paid gig as a fashion photographer.So how did you move specifically towards fashion photography? I never really planned it, but then again, who does? Honestly, I just fell into it because of my obsession with the male form. When I was studying fine arts, painting and sketching, the naked torsos of men were the highlights of my college days. In college, I was inspired by the works of Herb Ritts, Nobuyoshi Araki, Helmut Newton, Alair Gomes and Guy Bourdin. Most of them became fashion photographers, but in the beginning I think they also were just as obsessed with the human form, male or female. I love the light, lines and the forms that I see. My very first assignment as a photographer, the shoot involved gorgeous bodies in just swimwear and kaftans. Where did you grow up? I grew up all over, but I was born in Manila. Thus, I see myself as made in the Philippines, assembled in Dubai and presented in New York. Both my parents are Filipinos.How have these wildly different cultures you've immersed yourself into influenced you? Each city gave so many great memories that I try to revisit every time I pass by for work or vacation. One of my favorite things about being a photographer is that it allows you to be a nomad. You can pack up your bags and go to another city, another country -- especially if you're in a fashion hub. The portfolio that you have built all throughout your travels will eventually help you -- it becomes your passport to another country. Like what they say, if you make it in New York, you'll make it anywhere. It's the truth; having a good book and working for a long period in New York gives you some sort of a pass all over the globe and an unspoken invitation to another foreign country with a younger fashion industry. I am really finding my voice by seeing things and experiencing things right in front of me rather than in a museum or library. I see the origins of those ideas and visuals that fill a library or museum. I want to create something personal in my work through travel. Even before I began to travel, I loved reading -- and for me they are the same. Traveling is almost like the 3-D version of reading a good book; they both open your eyes to a lot of things that the media sometimes doesn't show. You're engaged by various opinions wherever you go. The best way to immerse yourself in cultures is to meet different types of people.Is there a favorite city out of all you've been to? What attracts you to where you are currently in? What do you have planned for Paris, for Europe? I believe I have been really fortunate to be able to live and work in the cities that I have fantasized about as a child growing up. I dreamt of living in New York and Rio de Janeiro -- two of the most expensive cities in the world -- as a child, and I supported myself to accomplish that fantasy even before I turned 30. My favorite city that I have lived in is still New York, followed closely by Rio de Janeiro because I can imagine myself living in the Big Apple for the rest of my life. I love both cities as they are both very exotic thus fueling my eagerness to learn more.What is an issue you have with the state of the fashion photo industry today? So many talented ethnic photographers are not given so many opportunities as their white counterparts. If you create a list of 100 top fashion photographers now in 2012, you'll find 98 Caucasians on that list and two token minorities. If you make a list of the 100 most influential photographers of all time (not only fashion, but the whole nine yards) there will be 95 Caucasians, most likely, and five minorities. I wrote on my blog that I was a bit naive on thinking that it's only purely racism. But based on my experiences during my travels, I believe the colonization of the world has something to do with it. The world, at some pivotal point in history, has been divided into two groups: the colonizers and the colonized. Why has photography been a rich man's hobby for the longest time? Why are most white people accustomed to photography so much more than any other races in history when the first surviving mention of the principles behind the pinhole camera or camera obscura belonged to a Chinese philosopher named Mozi in 470 to 390 BCE? An example of blatant exemption of minorities in the fashion industry: never in the history of Vogue U.S. has an Asian, nor other ethnic minority, shone on the cover.Rinko Kikuchi is the first Japanese actress to be nominated for an Academy Award in 50 years for the film Babel. Freida Pinto is an Indian actress best known for her portrayal of Latika in the 2008 Academy Award-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. Both women have appeared in international glossies, except for major American fashion magazines. In the 4,130-plus Vogue U.S. covers, only less than 23 are non-Caucasians and no Asian-Americans can be found on a Vogue U.S. cover from 1892 to the present. Only two non-Caucasian photographers (Walter Chin and Mert Alas) shot five covers from 1892 to the present. Anna Wintour continues the Vogue U.S. tradition of consistently using Caucasians in front of and behind the camera to represent its racially monolithic, aspirational ideals of beauty, wealth and power in United States of America and the rest of the world.Why do you think this kind of racism persists behind the camera and not simply before it? I started blogging at the time when there were less minorities on the runway and less minorities on the covers, you can reference the surveys conducted by Jezebel on the blatant exclusion of minorities on the runway in 2010 and 2011, which is the highest of all time. It is only in the past months that I've noticed that more and more minorities are getting a much-deserved comeback. An example is at models.com, where the top 50 includes so many East Asians now, like Liu Wen, Sui, Fei Fei Sun, Xiao Wen Ju, Tao Okamoto and Wang Xiao. It's possible that aspirational beauty doesn't have to be exclusively white. Like in any form of media, colors other than white are perceived negatively: ""White is good and black is evil"" is a common writer's guide to color coding moralities -- Darth Vader is evil because he is wearing black, Snow White is good because she is ""as white as snow.""Growing up in an industry without heroes that look and talk like you is difficult. There are overwhelmingly more and more white models because there are more white photographers and influential editors running the cycle. They shoot what they think is beautiful for them ever since the first fashion magazine was published during the colonies of the United States and Great Britain were at their all-time high and minorities were just symbols of poverty and slavery.Did you get a ""big break"" when trying to establish yourself and your career? I always bump into someone who is successful in their own industries in strange ways. Incidentally, these off-chance meetings happen to be pivotal periods in my life when I make a major change. I met photographer Robert Polidori in Dubai randomly when he was shooting the Burj Al Arab for Vanity Fair. I saw this guy using a large-format camera in the middle of the desert and I approached him to take a closer look at his camera. My curiosity led to a conversation, the conversation led to coffee and that day I decided I wanted to take a trip to New York and try it out. One of the first people I called in the city was Robert and I was shocked to find out that he had an exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum that same week. Also, I bumped into then-stylist Nicola Formicetti in B Bar in NYC randomly and he told me he saw the first cover I shot in Milan for Rodeo magazine of Seijo Imazaki. He said he loved it and we have been in touch ever since. He gave me so much advice about my work. You're an aspiring novelist as well as a photographer; do you see your photography as a narrative? How do you approach these two mediums differently? I try my best to tell a story with every photo that I take. Of course, some are more successful than others. I feel like I need more maturity to actually master storytelling through photographs. It's not easy to capture a history or story in just one take. I see myself as a minority because most fashion photographers that I know, from the top fashion photographers to the students and hobbyists, are more visual in their learning processes. I want to challenge myself to be different from the norm. I've never met another fashion photographer in my life who also loves reading and writing as much as I do.I want to have fun with my photographs as much as I want to also have substance and a story, from the simple to the more complicated, the obvious to the more subliminal. I think adding layers to your work, whatever your passion is -- dancing, singing, writing, painting or even fashion photography -- is much more challenging for me, engages me more and also inspires me to write.Who are writers you enjoy, are influenced by or look up to? Right now, I don't have any specific writers in general that I love or can see that my work has been influenced by. However, I enjoy Stephen King, Anne Rice, Patricia Highsmith and Harper Lee. It is hard to find time to read a book with my fulltime job as a photographer as so much time goes into it. I still edit my own photos, plan my own trips, network in the industry, research my own concepts and maintain my social media. Writing and reading for me breaks that monotony. You've said you photograph, or treat, your models as though they are skyscrapers. Can you talk about this eye you've developed? I almost always shoot worm's eye view as it makes my subjects appear almost like giants of a fairytale. They look iconic and powerful, whether it's a male model in a skimpy Speedo or a female in haute couture.When I interviewed Hollywood photographer Greg Gorman on my blog a year ago, he commented on my work, ""I felt your images not only grasped the subjects in a bold austere way but presented the subjects in a very good light. Something I can't say about many of today's photographers whose imagery is this strange non-flattering, pseudo-editorial style that in most cases I find rather appalling and terribly forgettable in terms of memorable images. That is one of the things that drew me to your work: your respect for your subjects.""What are you currently working on, and what do you have planned next? I am currently working on a coffee table/monograph photo book about Brazil. Also, I'm busy writing a teen thriller fiction novel.What was the biggest challenge throughout your career so far? The biggest challenge for me is discovering myself through my work. All this time I have been trying to peel the onion to see what's in the middle. I want to know what makes my work unique, and that is very important to me. I need to mature and understand my passions in life: traveling, writing, photography, meeting people, hearing their stories, film. All this time, I was in search of that like the protagonist of the novel I'm working on -- a teenage boy living in New York City in search of himself, his identity, and his place in this world."

Farmers in the Midwest are struggling after a searing heat wave and prolonged drought took a toll on their summer harvests, and farmers say itￂﾒs even more important now for customers to support local growers by continuing to shop at farmers markets. (AP Photo/Dinesh Ramde)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6f6926000035007f7a22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Although I grew up as a city girl, a memorable period of my childhood was spent in the English countryside. Of those days, I recall most fondly the harvest season. Because the local farmers couldn't handle the workload by themselves (we are talking agriculture before heavy machinery came into use), all able bodies in the nearby villages -- including young children -- were enlisted to bring in the crops. Harvesting then was a race against time, and we all had a sense of urgency. Having enough food to get us safely through the winter was not to be taken for granted. Relying on imports from far-flung places around the world was not an option. ""Locally grown"" was not a slogan back then, it was all we had available to us.Having successful harvests is a major concern in all societies, including ours. Thanksgiving is one of our most celebrated holidays. Harvest festivals of all sorts are observed around the globe and they have a similar meaning, namely to commemorate the fact that survival is not guaranteed but depends on hard work as well as the cooperation of forces beyond our control. In a way, as joyful an event as it may be, this should be a rather humbling experience. It shows us that we are ultimately not in command of our fate, at least not at all times and in every regard.When news broke last summer that record heat waves were devastating crops all over the country, dramatic expected increases in food prices were announced almost immediately. That put families on already-tight food budgets further at risk of malnutrition and diet-related diseases. Widespread hunger, in the past only considered a persistent problem in developing countries, is becoming a reality here as well. It is also a sad fact that hunger and obesity often go together, especially among poor children. The most affordable foods are typically highly processed and laden with refined carbohydrates, fat, salt and sugar, all ingredients known to cause weight gain while offering little nutritional value.Buying locally grown fresh foods can offer a better alternative for everyone, including low-income families. ""By focusing your diet on products grown and raised within 100 miles of your home, you will likely end up eating more fruits and vegetables as well,"" says Tara Parker-Pope, a health and nutrition writer and frequent contributor to the New York Times' Well blog. She recommends that consumers shop as often as possible at local farmers' markets, not only because of the higher food quality at lower cost, but also to support food producers who practice more sustainable farming methods. People need to understand that processed, pre-packaged foods like fast foods and frozen dinners may be convenient and readily available throughout the year, regardless of season or choice of ingredients -- but they come at a steep price that is not reflected at the drive-through or checkout counter. To comprehend the real costs of our modern eating styles, we also have to consider the heavy dependency on fossil fuels for fertilizers and pesticides as well as long-distance transportation and refrigeration. For these reasons and others, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends making buying locally grown and harvested foods a priority in every household. Eating nearby grown produce is not only healthier, according to the agency, it also helps the environment and climate by reducing the amounts of energy it takes to put dinner on the table. So, when you and your loved ones get together this coming Thanksgiving to count your blessings, why not discuss some ideas how you can personally make a few smart diet and lifestyle changes. They eventually may add up to significant differences for both you and the world around you.
