I look forward to the glitter and macaroni covered cards and the time spent together as a family. But like most fathers, I worry. I worry about the world my children grow up in and the challenges they will face. This year, I'm thinking of all the veterans out there who are fathers, particularly those who came back injured from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We can't always see their scars. It is estimated that about 30 percent have diagnosable PTSD. More young veterans have  died by their own hand  than were killed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. At present, 22 American veterans kill themselves every day. A lot of these men and women are parents. All of them are someone's child. How do we help keep families together against such heart-wrenching statistics? As an addiction treatment professional, the one thing I can say for certain is that if you do not get care commensurate with the depth of your suffering, you will likely have to self-medicate. That's just how it works. PTSD and substance abuse very often go hand in hand. Try to stick it out without self-medicating and you may end up with suicide.""I also know from working day in and day out with addicts and those suffering from psychological disorders along with their substance abuse that if you don't seek help, your whole family suffers. It is not true that you can only get help for yourself. I have seen hundreds of men and women turn their lives around out of love for their families, particularly their children. You deserve the best treatment you can afford. Your family deserves it too. And believe it or not, there is quality care available at all price points. You may have to work to find it, but it is there. This Father's Day, if you need substance abuse or mental health assistance, ask for it, especially if you are a veteran. Your family needs you and most likely, they love you. There is nothing in your past that should prevent you from having a full and beautiful life with the people you love. This Father's Day - whether you are a father or a mother - think of your children and give them the parent they need and want you to be.

And it is costing them their lives. Last November, Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Cleveland, was gunned down by a police officer responding to a 9-1-1 call reporting ""a guy"" in the park with a ""probably fake gun."" Just one and a half seconds after arriving and without warning over his vehicle's megaphone, police officer Timothy Loehmann shot and killed Tamir. That the gun, a plastic air-soft gun, was probably fake was never communicated to the police. That he was a child was never articulated to or by Loehmann. That he was Black was.As Rice lay dying, his 14-year-old sister rushed to be by her brother. She was tackled to the ground, handcuffed and placed in the back of the police vehicle. Last Saturday, Kalief Browder, a 22-year-old Black man from New York City, died by way of suicide. At 16, Browder was sent to Rikers Island -- New York City's most infamous jail complex -- a facility that holds up to 15,000 people, many unable to make bail, as they await trial.Browder was sent to Rikers for allegedly stealing a backpack, an allegation for which he never stood trial. Instead, he spent three years in jail. Almost two of the years were spent in solitary confinement. Allegedly, he was frequently subjected to psychological and physical abuse at the hands of inmates and guards. Browder refused plea deals on the basis of his innocence. Three years into his terrifying ordeal and amidst increased media scrutiny, the charges were dropped. Once released, Browder had great difficulty recovering from the trauma of his imprisonment, frequently recreating the conditions of his incarceration at home. On June 6, he hung himself out of the back window of his mother's home. Just one day earlier in McKinney, Texas, Dajerria Becton, a 15-year-old, bikini-clad guest at a pool party, was violently thrown to the ground and pinned down by Officer Eric Casebolt. When other teenagers approached their friend, Casebolt unholstered his gun and turned in their direction. Casebolt was responding to a call about an incident at the pool. Upon arriving, the video evidence, filmed by a white teenager, indicates that Casebolt only addressed the Black teenagers, even allowing what appeared to be a white civilian to assist in his detainment of the teens. These seemingly unrelated stories are inextricably linked through the span of American history in the ways in which the bodies of Black children have been exploited, dehumanized and policed through the centuries. This manifests in a justice system, which is supposed to protect the rights and vulnerabilities of children, that is 18 times more likely to sentence a Black child as an adult. It also manifests in a public that accepts institutionalized racism in our formal institutions and reinforces it through the litany of inequalities inherent American society.A 2014 study, published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found that Black boys are widely dehumanized, perceived as older and more likely to face ""police violence if accused of a crime."" The researchers argue that dehumanization is the denial of full ""humanness"" and the subsequent denial of human protections. Historians of genocide assert that dehumanization is a necessary preconditioned for ""culturally... or state-sanctioned violence"" against against any racialized or Othered group. The dehumanization of Black children has been a pervasive, yet underexplored theme in American history. Throughout the slave period, Black children were regularly separated from their parents and sold to other plantations -- both their childhood and humanity were denied in the face of a racial capitalism that valued only their value as a commodity and source of labor. Their productivity on the fields was often held to the exhausting and inhumane standards of Black adults, themselves cruelly and savagely exploited for every ounce of labor their bodies could produce. Under these conditions, questions of justice and punishment were usually settled outside of the court system, by slave-masters, willing to be cruel in their designs but always with a mind to protect their financial investment. The end of the slave period saw the end of the slave-master as police. Two institutions, one social, another state sanctioned filled the void for violence: lynching and the judicial system. Between 1882 and 1927, at least 3,500 Blacks were lynched in the United States. As the renowned historian, Manning Marable wrote in his landmark book, How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America, lynching was not limited to Blacks, but statistics do indicate that between 1918 and 1927, 92 percent of all victims were Black. Women and children were not shielded from such acts of popular violence. When a murdered Black sharecropper's pregnant wife intended to press charges against her husband's killers, an angry mob accosted her, hanged her from a tree, lit her on fire, and with a knife ""ripped open the abdomen in a crude Caesarian operation. Out tumbled the prematurely born child. Two feeble cries it gave -- and received for answer the heel of a stalwart man, as life was ground out of the tiny form."" In this instance, both a woman and child were subject to vicious injustice of a lynch mob. Not even a newborn child was safe or innocent in the eyes of the murderous crowd. By the 1940s, such forms of anti-Black violence began to submerge as anti-lynching campaigns, demographic shifts, and popular opinion made such forms of mob injustice less practical. Still, lynching never completely vanished. The most notable exception was the savage murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old killed in 1955 Mississippi for reportedly whistling at a white woman. As lynching waned ""racists began to rely on the state apparatus to carry out the battle for White Supremacy."" And still, Black children were not shielded from institutionalized racist violence. Take for example that the youngest legally executed American, George Stinney Jr., was a 14-year-old Black boy. Stinney was accused of the murder of two white children in South Carolina. His three-hour trial, held without witnesses or physical evidence, led to his conviction for murder, largely based on a coerced confession. In 2014, Stinney's conviction was overturned. That Stinney was tried as an adult and executed at the hands of the legal system was unprecedented. Unfortunately, Stinney's case would not be an anomaly, but serves as an indication of how deep-rooted racial inequality toward children in the judicial system exists. Decades later, the racial disparities in the criminal justice system remain stark. A 2005 report by the criminal justice think-tank The Sentencing Project, found that Black defendants are afforded less legal assistance and considerably harsher sentences than ""comparably situated"" white defendants. Furthermore, Black defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants for similar offenses, and the severity of their punishment is often increased if the victim is perceived to be white.A 2014 report published by Columbia University indicates that these disparities around punishment exist not just in the criminal justice system, but also in our schools. By examining data from New York City and Boston public schools, the researchers found, for example, that Black girls ""are subject to discipline that is harsher and more frequent than that of their white peers, and are six times more likely to be suspended than white girls."" They also uncovered that ""reported misconduct by Black girls at school prompts a seemingly disproportionate -- and often violent -- response by school and local authorities.""The general criminalization of Black children, extends beyond the courtroom and the reaches of the lynchmob, but into the minds of many Americans. In our nation's classrooms, where children spend most of their time, teachers subjectively interpret misbehavior based on racial stereotypes and are more likely to ""label Black students as troublemakers."" Based on these stereotypes, Black students are more likely to be disciplined harshly by teachers and administrators. These stereotypes endanger Black children in many settings, be it the classroom where they encounter harsh discipline, the judicial system where they are cruelly and unusually sentenced, as they play with toy guns in public parks, or as they attend suburban pool parties where they are aggressively mistreated by officers of the law and civilians alike. That institutional racism exists is not to be denied. That it informs our perceptions of justice is borne out by the data. That it permeates the very social fabric of America is manifest in our attitudes. These problems are to be considered and addressed with the utmost seriousness. There are many costs for these great injustices, not the least being the lives of children. When Dajerria lay, face first in the grass, with a police officer's knee in her back, we witnessed the denial of her childhood. Perhaps Kalief Browder's words belong here: ""I lost my childhood, I lost my happiness."""
2,SCIENCE,Why Are Teens So Moody And Impulsive? This Neuroscientist Has The Answer,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teenage-brain-neuroscience_n_7537188.html,,2015-06-14,"Teenagers use their mobile phones after school time in Vaasa, Finland, on March 30, 2010. AFP PHOTO / OLIVIER MORIN (Photo credit should read OLIVIER MORIN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c2f957e210000dd09caaaa0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Parents often complain their teenagers are moody, impulsive and self-centered -- but it may not be their fault.The secret to understanding teens' behavior may lie in understanding their brain chemistry, says Dr. Frances Jensen, chair of the University of Pennsylvania neurology department and author of The Teenage Brain: A Neuroscientist's Survival Guide to Raising Adolescents and Young Adults. Jensen, a neuroscientist and mother of two teenage boys, describes adolescence as the ""second critical period of development,"" after early childhood. The brain is developing until the mid-20s, she explains, and this has significant implications for young adults' emotional lives and decision-making. In a recent interview with HuffPost Science, Jensen answered some of our questions about the mysteries of the teenage brain.What inspired you to study the teenage brain? I’ve had a career for many years looking at brain development. When I was doing all these experiments in my lab, I didn’t realize that I also had an experiment going on in my house with my sons, who were definitely changing, to say the least.What was going on with my sons was fascinating -- and it was also frustrating. So I decided that I would turn my potential anger and frustration into curiosity, and given that I was already in brain development, I just switched my focus to a different window of development, and I realized that there was a wealth of extremely recent information and a lot of this research just wasn’t getting out to the public.What makes the teen brain so different from the adult brain?It was only recently that scientists realized that the brain is the last organ in the body to reach maturity and that it does not reach maturity during puberty. Development goes on into the mid-20s. That was big news, and people only became aware of it in the early 2000s when it was starting to hit the literature... As a parent and a scientist, it all started to gel for me. In every species that we look at, it's the last organ in the body to reach full maturity. Because the brain is built on experience, and it takes the first two and a half decades of life to sort of ""scaffold"" the brain. During the teenage years, your brain is actually stronger for learning and memory and being imprinted upon than it will be later in life. It’s a carpe diem point. Of course, there are a lot of weaknesses, and that’s what you’re picking up on as a parent -- Why did this smart person do this really stupid thing? What are they thinking? Do they think?  -- And a lot of that has science behind it. It’s made me a more patient parent. In terms of decision-making, would it be accurate to say that teenagers are wired to be risk-takers? Yes, it is absolutely accurate. What we know is that the frontal lobes -- which are the seat of executive function, decision-making, empathy, judgment, insight and impulse control -- are the last places that hook up to the rest of the brain during development. It’s not that teens don’t have frontal lobes -- they can still do really well on their SATs and reason through things. But split-second decision making is a weakness. They don’t involve their frontal lobes and that explains the, “Oh I’ll take a left into oncoming traffic because I think I can get past that truck barreling towards me.” So we think the risk taking is very much biologically based and teens are very impulsive. Their decisions -- especially the split-second decisions, which are more vulnerable -- are also under more emotional influence than they are in an adult. The emotional areas of the brain (the amygdala, the lymbic system), the reward systems and the systems for sexual desire are hooked up to the rest of the brain ahead of the frontal lobes. So they have high emotional responses. And fMRI has shown that the limbic systems light up much faster and much more intensely [in teens] than adults. That’s partly because they don’t have the frontal lobes to say, “There’s a way out of the situation,” or “There are going to be consequences if you get mad at this person.” Their decisions may be under more emotional influence than they will be later in life, because there’s an imbalance between the two systems.Does this also explain why teenagers are so moody? We believe this [imbalance] contributes to the moodiness and can increase the stress response, too. This is a concern because too much stress in the teen years changes the way your brain develops -- it can actually set up neurochemical imbalances that increase your risk for depression in later life. Where do hormones fit into this picture? Hormones causing moodiness is kind of the myth. There’s much more to the story than hormones, and that’s a really important thing to get across. It’s more about the imbalance between your frontal lobe and your limbic system than it is about the hormones that are being produced the testes and ovaries running around in your bloodstream. There’s much more to the story than hormones. However, their brains are seeing levels of hormones that they’ve never seen before, and they have to learn to manage those hormones. It is a learning curve on how to manage the ups and downs of a testosterone surge or the waxing and waning of estrogen and progesterone through the menstrual cycle... Through experience, the brain will dampen the fluctuations in behavior in response to fluctuations in hormones. Teenagers today are more connected to digital devices than any generation before them. Should we be concerned about how this is affecting their brains? There’s a couple things to be said about the digital invasion of our brains at that age. The first is yes, this is a thing of the future -- it’s not going to go away and it’s probably only going to get more intense. The amount of information that's coming at teenage brains is unprecedented compared to any other generation. They’re also going to have to grow up in this world and they have to adapt. Children and teenagers can learn better than adults -- in most cases, they’re learning technology better than us, and they’re probably able to multitask better than adults. But they're not perfect. I cite a study in the book about teens' ability to multitask, which finds that they’re better than other generations simply because they’ve grown up on this. But they still do better when they’re focusing on a single task rather than on multiple tasks. That’s important for teenagers to know because they’ll still suffer the consequences of divided attention for encoding and recall of information. In the book, you talk about some of the particularly negative effects that smoking, drinking, marijuana and other drugs can have on the developing brain. Why might these substances be more dangerous for a teenager? Here’s another myth to be debunked: Teens are not as resilient as we think they are. People say “Oh, they’ll bounce back,” but they don’t. Drugs and alcohol and stress work on, guess what -- brain synapses. They have more [synapses] than we do, and it’s not a stretch to suggest that those drugs will have more of an effect in the moment on those brains than they would in adulthood. With cannabis, the effects last longer for a teenager and the residual impairment of synaptic function from smoking pot can last for days. Likewise, binge drinking can actually cause brain injury in the adolescent with alcohol levels that would just cause severe intoxication in an adult. So there’s the acute effect. But in addition, their brains are growing every day during this period. You give a drug, you put the brain development on hold or set it backwards. After the drug has cleared the system, the brain is not in the place it’s supposed to be three days later. You’ve actually changed the way the brain is developing, and neurochemical systems start to change. A recent study found that helicopter parenting can negatively affect teens by lowering their self-esteem and increasing risky behaviors like binge-drinking and shoplifting. Is there a neurological basis to this? What you’re going to get with helicopter parenting is a kind of learned helplessness. The kids have never had to make a decision. They’re not even aware that there are decisions there to be made because they were denied the awareness of the decisions by the parents. I’ve heard another term people have been using in the past couple years -- “bulldozer parents” -- who are the ones who clear the future for their kids so that they can just walk through.The teenage years are a period where you’re really scaffolding, for the last time, the brain you’re going to live with for the rest of your life. You’re developing experiences, you’re learning from the experiences, you’re creating synaptic pathways. You have to learn from experience -- learning isn’t all in the classroom, you have to learn from your own mistakes. Trial and error will teach you things. I think parents should make sure they stay out of the day-to-day trial and error, because your kid is going to need to use that experience to learn when to take a risk and when not to take a risk. What you’re going to get with helicopter parenting is a kind of learned helplessness. The kids have never had to make a decision, they’re not even aware that there are decisions there to be made. So what should these parents do? Do with this information what you will, but parents should be aware that this is a really important time for development… Helicopter parents are often very well-meaning, but they’d be better off helping their kids with their own introspection, which is something a teenager has a great deal of challenge with as they develop their frontal lobes and their own comfort with themselves. You can help guide them through discussions, making them answer their own questions but structuring it for them. It’s like Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000 hours [of practice at a skill]. If you deny your kid those 10,000 hours, you’re doing irrevocable damage to their future, probably. Any other neuroscientist-approved advice for parents -- or teenagers themselves? Being armed with facts can help you be a more patient parent because you understand the neurobiology. It also helps the kids themselves. When I give talks to kids, they’re really excited to hear that they’re seeking their identities in these years. They can change their fortunes. If you’re not a scholar at 14, it’s important for you to know that the doors aren’t all closed.Their mistakes shouldn’t define them; they have a lot of capacity to change. We have to understand that as a society too -- there’s a huge amount of dynamic change that can happen. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. "

This time, we speak with Michael McFaul, professor of Political Science at Stanford University and former U.S. Ambassador to Russia.President Barack Obama announced on Monday that leaders of the G7 countries have agreed to maintain sanctions against Russia over Moscow's role in the ongoing conflict in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. There's been much debate over the West's decision to impose sanctions. Critics have pointed out that Russia is still refusing to honor the Minsk II cease-fire, despite the heavy economic burden of the sanctions. The WorldPost spoke with former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul about the G7 sanctions policy. McFaul is currently a professor of political science at Stanford University. G7 leaders announced this week that they would be keeping sanctions against Russia in place. What's the general scope of these sanctions and whom are they targeting?The scope of the sanctions are both individuals and Russian companies that are in some way implicated. There are two different rounds of them, first for Crimea and then for what’s happening in eastern Ukraine. If you look at the list, you’ll see these are senior Russian government officials and some of the biggest companies in Russia.How have these sanctions affected the Russian economy?It’s a really hard question. What I see sometimes in the debate is that sanctions aren’t working or sanctions are working, but tracing causality on a dependent variable when there’s multiple independent variables is difficult. So, what percentage of the decline in the Russian economy is due to sanctions versus falling oil prices versus other factors is a very difficult question. I think what’s most interesting is just listening to what Russian government officials are saying. They all say, including Putin, that sanctions have impacted what’s going on there. The fact that Putin is repeatedly looking for sanctions relief, such as on Wednesday when he met with the pope, must mean that they’re having some effect.If they were as ineffective as some people say, why would he keep calling for them to be lifted? That to me is pretty strong evidence that there is an impact, and there’s no doubt in my mind that the Kremlin has a strategy focused on a small set of countries in Europe to try to get the sanctions lifted. If they don’t have any effect then why are they courting the Hungarians and the Greeks and maybe even the Italians to look for sanctions relief?The fact that Putin is repeatedly looking for sanctions relief ... must mean that they’re having some effectSometimes in international relations you have to take measures to demonstrate disapproval. I believe strongly that had there been no response at all to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and now Putin’s support of a proxy war in Ukraine, that it would encourage bad behavior both by Putin and other international actors. Have these sanctions changed Russia’s calculus in eastern Ukraine?Well the cause and effect between sanctions and a change in foreign policy needs to be measured in years and decades rather than weeks and months, because it’s an indirect effect. But sanctions, for instance, have stopped the activities that [Russian state oil producer] Rosneft and Exxon Mobil were planning for the Arctic -- a project that I heard Putin personally say was one of the most important U.S.-Russian projects in the last several years. They just announced they’re not doing that. There’s no doubt in my mind that’s an effect of sanctions. The private capital to support Russian companies has all dried up and that’s a direct effect of sanctions, but to trace those effects onto Putin, that’s a harder thing to do. I would say so far, no he hasn’t withdrawn from eastern Ukraine, but he also hasn’t marched to Kiev. You also have to remember that Novorossiya, which was an idea people were kicking around very seriously a couple months ago, has disappeared from Putin’s lexicon. Maybe that’s because he’s decided that going forward would be too costly. But finally, imagine if you called up [Cold War-era American diplomat] George Kennan a year after they adopted containment and said, ‘Well hey George, it doesn’t seem like your plan is working.’ What would that analysis lead to? That policy took decades to show results, several decades. Yet now we all look at containment as this strategic wisdom, one of the smartest foreign policies of the 20th century. That was a strategy set on patience, staying the course and not rethinking our strategy a couple years into it.Will this then be the status quo of sanctions being continually implemented and there being a degree of instability in the region for the foreseeable future?My hope is that Putin rethinks what’s going on out in eastern Ukraine and adopts the Minsk accords, which in my view are very favorable to Russia and Russia’s proxies, and that could be a new status quo.My worry and my prediction is that the current situation actually benefits Putin’s short-term interests of destabilizing the Ukrainian government and undermining the Ukrainian economy. He wants to see them fail, so having this open, low-level intensity conflict but not a resolution of it adds pressure on the regime. He doesn’t have a lot of short term reasons to change his course, but over the long term and medium term I think that will change. There’s a lot of people I know in Russia -- prominent business people, even some people in the government -- that don’t like this mess that they’re in.Let me be blunt, there’s a lot of people I know in Russia -- prominent business people, even some people in the government -- that don’t like this mess that they’re in. There was a different way, a different worldview to make Russia strong and great that was about integrating with the West, developing markets and increasing foreign investments.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

10,IMPACT,Food Hubs Could Be Revolutionary -- But They're Not As Simple As They Seem,"Kate Danaher, ContributorLending manager for sustainable food and agriculture, RSF Soci...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-hubs-could-be-revolu_b_7539060.html,"Food hubs -- enterprises that actively manage the aggregation, distribution and marketing of source-identified foods from local and regional producers -- could be the key link in a new supply chain that fixes our broken food system.",2015-06-13,"In this Dec. 16, 2014 photo, Sam Rothberg, packing house supervisor for the Intervale Food Hub in Burlington, Vt., packs carrots into weekly deliveries of food produced by area farmers. Food hubs around the country are getting more fresh, locally produced food out to consumers and giving farmers another avenue for expanding their sales. (AP Photo/Lisa Rathke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1db362000009900ffc613.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When we heard Ann Karlen, executive director of Fair Food in Philadelphia, give a talk called ""Wait, Wait -- Don't Start That Food Hub,"" we knew we were looking at a genuine trend. If you're working in the food systems field, it suddenly seems like everyone and their brother is starting a food hub. Even the mainstream media has taken notice (see this recent AP story).On the one hand, that's a great thing. Food hubs -- enterprises that actively manage the aggregation, distribution and marketing of source-identified foods from local and regional producers -- could be the key link in a new supply chain that fixes our broken food system. That's why RSF Social Finance, the organization I work for, has been the country's most active lender to food hubs. On the other hand, the momentum and hype around local food and regional food systems is leading a lot of well-intentioned people to think, ""Let's start a food hub! How hard can it be?"" The answer is: really hard. That's partly because it's not entirely clear which business models perform best in this nascent sector. The Wallace Center has been collecting data on growth trends and effective operational practices with an eye toward creating benchmarks, and its National Good Food Network program maintains a repository of research to date. From our own food hub portfolio, we've learned that at minimum, building these fundamental supply chain businesses requires patience, considerable business skill, and discipline to ensure that farmers benefit. Successful models are out there -- but each hub must find its own pathThe universe of food hubs is still so nascent that the best business model has yet to emerge; there's no road map yet. Every fledging food hub needs to determine its own most favorable operating structure based on what it's trying to achieve, who it wants to serve, the partners and customers it needs to work with, geographic particularities, its distribution plan, and other unique factors.That said, we've yet to see a food hub that fits the venture capital model. These are high-risk, low-margin and typically slow-growth businesses -- generally not an attractive business profile to an equity investor. One food hub we know tried to scale with a for-profit model and ended up near bankruptcy. It did grow quickly, but couldn't survive without a major infusion of equity capital, and that infusion was not forthcoming. Another hub that tried a for-profit strategy is Corbin Hill Food Project in the Hudson River Valley, which aggregates produce from regional farms to supply CSA boxes for families in Harlem and other underserved New York neighborhoods. It too hit a wall: The cost of producing and transporting the food was more than Corbin Hill could charge the target population. As a result, Corbin Hill recently reincorporated as a nonprofit organization so it could meet its capital needs with grant funding. It now receives support from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. For-profit models can work -- they just require patience. Some of our most successful food hubs include Eastern Carolina Organics, a farmer- and employee-owned company founded in 2005, and Ithaca, New York-based Regional Access, which started in 1989 with one truck and is now a multifaceted distribution and logistics company serving 600-plus regional and national grocery stores, restaurants, buying clubs, institutions and small natural food stores. Another example, outside our portfolio, is San Francisco-based Veritable Vegetable, a trailblazer founded in 1974 as part of a collective called the People's Food System. The company now serves a network of over 600 organic farms, grocers, cooperative markets, restaurants and schools.On the nonprofit side, Common Market has become an influential model. The enterprise, which provides a distribution link between threatened Delaware Valley farms and urban communities that lack access to fresh foods, has a nonprofit structure but runs like a business. It focused on reaching its low-income target market through high-volume institutional buyers, such as hospitals and schools, and grew steadily but slowly with support from both loan and grant funds through RSF and others. Today, Common Market's distribution business is profitable and growing with little philanthropic support; philanthropic capital instead supports the enterprise's programmatic work, such as assisting the food hub movement.One thing is clear: if a food hub wants to pay farmers a fair wage and get fresh food to underserved communities (as most of these organizations do), it will need diverse revenue streams, such as a market-priced CSA-type offering or grant support. Working capital challenges loom largeEvery food hub we've looked at has been undercapitalized. That makes the management team's discipline and focus even more important than it is with start-ups in other fields. Start-up food hubs sometimes get so focused on simply moving the food that they struggle to live up to their commitment to changing the food system. Farmers are the core element of that system, and they can't bear the brunt of food hubs' cash flow problems. To provide high-quality food for local populations in a way that's economically sustainable, farmers should be paid within 15 days, at least most of the time. But food hub customers often take 30 or more days to pay (60 to 100 in the case of many institutions), leaving a cash flow gap. And when cash flow won't cover all of a food hub's business obligations, payments to producers are often the first to get delayed.That makes a line of credit -- ideally one with a flexible structure that accounts for seasonal needs -- the most important financial instrument a growing food hub can have. To get one, the hub needs to prove that it can handle tricky finances. Even then, the management team may need to look beyond conventional funding options. Most of our food hub borrowers are financed through program-related investment (PRI) lending -- foundation funds loaned to mission-related enterprises. Often they need several types of funding, an approach we call integrated capital. For example, a recent loan to Hudson Valley Harvest, a for-profit food hub in Kingston, New York, was possible in part because of a $100,000 loan guarantee from our philanthropic Local Initiatives Fund. Such guarantees are important tools for food hubs because many of them lack the collateral assets to meet a lender's underwriting standards.Making food hubs workWe believe that food hubs are the vanguard of rejuvenated regional food systems; we wouldn't be devoting so much attention to them otherwise. We're inspired every day by food hubs across the country that are growing and sharing their knowledge with others. But developing successful models is still a work in progress. Creating food hubs that are enduring solutions -- not just fads -- requires founders and funders with a long-term commitment, a willingness to look beyond conventional approaches, and a clear-eyed view of the challenges.

Such a storm occurs because pertinent fragments of information are often lost in translation through text and email attempts at conveying one's message. The problem is that vocal inflection, vocal volume and facial expressions, among other factors, are all key components in ensuring thorough communication.How we deliver our message is just as crucial as the words contained within the message. Language is only one aspect of communication and is no more important than the others. Even the use of emojis does not do an appropriate job of ensuring we get our energy and intentions across. Everyone knows the girl who inserts a ""smiley face"" emoji after blasting someone with a blatant insult. (Which, for the record, I would like to take a moment to express that inserting a smiley face after an obviously catty comment does not make it any less of a catty comment.)Take Shelter From Your Smartphone...There is so much ""play room"" for passive-aggressive behavior within social media and text communication that people have even begun to analyze and dissect each others' use of emojis. Everything is up for analysis, and is therefore often misread. In this world we live in, we have more means than ever to make new friends and romantic conquests as well as interact with the ones we already have, yet these means bring with them a world of frustrating possibilities. We are simultaneously empowered and crippled by our communication options.Not long ago, I had a nightmare that a freight train was coming straight toward me, absolutely out of nowhere, yet I stood on the track frozen and terrified. I have both received and witnessed others receiving text and email responses, caused by misunderstandings, which produced feelings that immensely similar to the emotion I experienced in my nightmare. We are human beings, driven by our egos, and attempting to interact and convey emotions through technological devices. Therefore, we must understand there is enormous propensity for error.Choose Your Interpretations Wisely...People read their texts, emails or scan through their social media news feeds and process all of the information through whichever filter they may be utilizing on that particular day. Their current circumstances are shaping their mindset at the given moment. Their mindset determines their interpretations. In fact, there have been instances where I have noticed myself reading words incorrectly, especially when in a hurry or in a negative frame of mind. I have quickly read through lengthy texts and even filled in my own versions of some of the sentences, for my brain, so conditioned to be both impatient and defensive, was anticipating what the person was attempting to convey to me. This is classic behavior within our generation.Let's say, for example, you are having a stressful day which becomes compounded by feelings of fear in regards to an argument with a friend. When you receive a text from that friend regarding the issue at hand, you may interpret their message in a dramatically different way than they were attempting to express it to you. Your friend may have been trying to communicate their message to you with a hug, whereas you may have interpreted it as a finger pointing in your face. I actually had someone tell me once that they were not so offended by the content of my text message as they were offended by the ""tone of [my] text,"" however there was no tone to speak of because it was a text message.Thou Shalt Not React & TextThe point of this article is to stress the importance of avoiding communication breakdowns as much as possible. It could cost you a friend, a date, or even a job. I say this because, oftentimes, communication breakdowns seldom end with one or two misunderstood text messages or emails. In the event a person becomes offended by something they have misread or misinterpreted, they may react negatively and therefore respond by saying things that may then offend the person they were originally offended by. Such a situation has the propensity to create circumstances which may shift the dynamic of the relationship, thereby causing it to become damaged or even unsalvageable. Instead of experiencing a knee-jerk reaction to be offended by the content of a text or email someone has sent to you, ask them to clarify it for you. Defensive texting can be as catastrophic as drunk texting.Give others the benefit of the doubt more often than assuming they meant you harm or disrespect. If you are unclear about the nature of or intention behind the communication, communicate further. Being a writer, I often feel more comfortable attempting to articulate my feelings, especially during periods of heightened emotion, through written word rather than spoken word. Sadly, I have endured more than a few unpleasant misunderstandings as a result. It is important to remember that one person's brain does not process information in the same way the next person's does. Interpretation is a powerful word, even without the additional complexity of text and email communication.Oh, and one more thing: I promise that nothing within the body of this article was written in ""that tone of voice""...I'm just being honest.P.S. Also, you may now insert an imaginary smiley face emoji...Read the original and extended version of this article by Lacey Johnson on The Daily Doll."

There are other chapter leaders throughout the country who aren't African-American. Donald Harris is one of them. The 77-year-old white, Jewish Brooklynite took the helm of the Maricopa County chapter of the NAACP in Arizona six months ago. He won the seat with a 19-0 vote of the executive board that he served on for 15 years. Harris weighed in on the controversy stemming from Dolezal's apparently bogus claim that she's African-American, echoing the NAACP's statement that ""One’s racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership.""Harris said more in AZ Central:""There are some people who don't think I'm the favorite flavor. ... I tell them to kiss my ass and I go out and do my job,"" Harris said. ""I love the organization. I want to see everybody treated equally. It ain't gonna happen in my lifetime but I want to see it happen. And that's why we have a NAACP. I believe in that. I fervently believe in it. I'm losing over $100,000 a year not going to my law office every day because I come down here."" ...Harris told AZ Central he had never met Dolezal and said he didn't have enough knowledge about her apparent deception.

Some music even has the power to communicate cosmically, through penetrating frequencies and otherworldy dimensions. Music can act as a conduit to express human emotion in a way that words cannot define. It also has the power to control human emotion with its multitudes of tones and combinations of sounds. In film, music is a highly emotive force that resonates through spectators emotional strings like the plucking of a harp. It can send chills, celebrate triumph, inspire romance and evoke sadness. What is even more powerful than the music itself is its creator.Nature Ganganbaigal is a Mongolian music composer and horse-head fiddle player from China who has recently completed his Masters in Music at New York University with a concentration in Scoring for Film and Multimedia. He has received several accolades and is the winner of New York University's 2014 Film Score Competition. His winning score was performed on Broadway. Becoming a regular in the film festival world, Nature's cosmic sounds are unique and recognizable. He has even dabbled in the world of video game music composition.In addition to his masterful composing abilities, Nature is also an accomplished Mongolian horse-head fiddle player, an ancient string instrument that plays the sounds of Mongolian culture. With one foot rooted in his Chinese past and the other sharing these roots with an American audience, Nature is a well-rounded musician who is even the composer and lead singer of Tengger Cavalry, an internationally recognized rock band.Noisey wrote, ""His tightly-held beliefs in Tibetan Buddhism and shamanism provide a deeper source for the positive message behind his music."" His genre-bending Mongolian folktronica paints beautiful images of sweeping landscapes, surreal vistas and moments of triumph. With so many complex layers of sound, Nature's creations are vast and spellbinding, captivating and magical. Without words, he teaches the listener of an ancient time, rich with color, culture and sensory bliss. In September of 2014 he released his first solo album titled To Where Tengger Leads Me. All 12 tracks tell a sonic story of heroism, ancient culture, animal spirits, adventure, and the majesty of the Chinese landscape. While each track offers its own musical flavor, ""Hymn Of The Earth"" spoke to me the strongest both rhythmically, instrumentally and narratively. An evocative song which transports you into his world, I was able to travel without moving, see without looking, and hear without listening. Organic and inorganic simultaneously, his folktronica flows through your mind in pure, liquid sound. As his bow gallops upon the fiddle, it is easy to hear his film score capabilities. Just listening to his rich compositions sans imagery unfurls an epic film in your mind's eye. Evoking synesthesia, Nature Ganganbaigal blurs the boundaries of the senses causing the listener to hear color, feel smells, and see sound. He has not only achieved success with To Where Tengger Leads Me, but transcendence into a cosmic frequency of sound. Music that is not solely for entertainment, but for ascension to a higher plane. His spirituality is manifested through his music, a gateway from the earthly to the divine. Nature Ganganbaigal brings his voyagers on a sacred odyssey to discover their sonic bliss.Website: http://www.nature-ganganbaigal.com/ Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/nature-ganganbaigal Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nature0ganganbaigal Bandcamp: https://nature0ganganbaigal.bandcamp.com/releases"

I will leave the response to Dolezal to others to parse, but I will take my colleague, Jonathan Capehart's advice and ""move along"" to, once again, school the conservatives in biology.As Richard Pérez-Peña reported in The New York Times:But many conservative commentators accused liberals of hypocrisy for accepting Caitlyn Jenner as a woman, but not Ms. Dolezal as black. 'So, to recap, if Rachel Dolezal says she is a man, we must all agree, on pain of being publicly censured,' Rod Dreher wrote in The American Conservative. 'But if Rachel Dolezal says she is black, it is fair game to challenge her claim.'I have to hand it to the right-wing noise machine to not have missed an opportunity for the trifecta of attacking feminists, trans women and African-Americans all at once. Quite an impressive feat, actually, with little preparation. But it all falls apart if we take the simple tweet Jonathan Capehart sent: FTLOG, Caitlyn Jenner is Not Pretending to Be a Woman.Charles Cook, quoted above, provides a number of explanations for Dolezal's behavior -- lying, delusional behavior or ""good, old-fashioned"" fabrication. I can add confabulation, an old-fashioned ruse, or maybe simply a padding of the résumé which got out of hand years ago and fit so well she even forgot her own truth. They all fit under the umbrella of pretense.Caitlyn Jenner is not pretending. Jenner has been a woman since birth -- or more likely, before birth -- like many, if not most, trans women. The development of transsexualism, the condition of being transgender, is well described by experts in the field as ""atypical gender development."" There is research galore to satisfy anyone's, including an open-minded conservative's, curiosity. And while there are variations in trans biology, many which have yet to be seriously studied due to the general American discomfort with all things sexual, it really is pretty clear cut: your sense of self as a sexual being, your gender identity, is rooted in your brain. We all, as human beings, have a gender identity. For the small proportion of the population, roughly around a half of a percent, whose gender identity doesn't match their genitals, the choice is to either live with the dysphoria, or reassign their gender to fit their gender identity, with or without anatomical and physiological interventions. This isn't, when you get down to it, very complicated.Sean Davis, writing in the Federalist, states:In a 2013 essay for The Atlantic, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates explained the social, not biological, foundation of race in the modern age:I agree with Coates, because regardless of the biological differences among the groups we classify as races, be they the perceived differences in melatonin levels in skin melanocytes or the genetic heritage of Ashkenazi vs. Sephardi Jews, the lived reality of the ""races"" in our modern world is purely a social construct. Where he steps in it is his categorical statement, reminiscent of the recent statement of Archbishop Cordileone about Jenner -- ""The clear biological fact is that a human being is born either male or female"" -- which is utterly false. I've written about this in greater depth the past two weeks, and I won't repeat myself here. Davis doesn't know that the definition of male and female is ""precise,"" because it isn't. That he, like Cordileone, states his cartoonish definition of sex as a simple fact is simply more evidence of the reality of cultural and religious conservatives who have, since the days of Galileo, refused to take the time to understand science or how it works. Ideology trumps reality, and it must be so comforting to be so simple-minded.There is also a particular reason that this analogy of ""transracial"" to ""transgender"" is so hurtful to the trans community. The lead proponent of the effort to repair trans kids, Dr. Ken Zucker of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, once famously concocted a new diagnosis called ""racial identity disorder"" to justify his team's efforts at reparative therapy:Suppose you were a clinician and a 4-year-old black kid came into your office and said he wanted to be white. Would you go with that? ... I don't think we would.In that NPR interview Zucker went on to say:By declaring the child as transgendered at, say, age 3 or age 4 or age 6, and then saying in a sense, 'Go with the flow,' ... that will impact, I believe, on how the kid's gender identity differentiates.The reporter interpreted that comment to mean that Zucker has come to believe that taking the view that kids are born transgender ultimately produces more transgender people. So have a few other holdouts, like Bailey, Blanchard and Vilain, about whom I've recently written. As Vilain and Bailey said about trans girls -"" we would prefer to save Maxine the serious medical interventions and possible side effects,"" which is simply a polite way of saying they'd like to spare the world another trans woman.Finally, to show that not all conservatives are transphobic simpletons, we have this studied response from Nick Gillespie of the libertarian wing:To say that Jenner's very public coming out disturbed social conservatives is an understatement. Between the ritual unwillingness to use female pronouns in relation to Jenner to exhortations that she is clearly deranged, it's fairer to say that cons lost their shit. Once again we have conservatives behaving badly. I hope we all, including the feminists among us, have learned from these past few days, and will choose to discriminate between pretense and truth."

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tells the story that when he first served in Congress, House Speaker Thomas P. ""Tip'' O'Neill, his Massachusetts colleague, urged Markey to vote for a energy bill that was unpopular in New England but important to President Jimmy Carter. The Speaker put his arm around Rep. Markey's shoulder and said, ""Eddie m'boy, I need your vote.'' Markey replied that he didn't think he could support the measure.The Speaker became more insistent. ""Eddie m'boy, I really need your vote.''""I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker,'' Rep. Markey responded. ""I just don't think I can vote for this.'' The Speaker racheted up the pressure. ""You have to understand, I really need your vote.''""Mr. Speaker,'' Markey replied. ""If you were right on this, you would have my vote. I just don't think you're right.''The Speaker pressed on. ""Eddie m'boy, if I were right, I wouldn't need your vote.''More than three quarters of House Democrats on Friday sent a message to President Obama: ""We know you need our votes, but we think you're just plain wrong on this.'' It all crumbled for Obama the moment Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi abandoned him. ""If TAA [Trade Adjustment Assistance] slows down the fast track, I'm prepared to vote against TAA,'' Pelosi said, leading Democrats to cast a solid ""No'' vote, 144 to 40.Democratic dissension on trade is nothing new. Liberals have always had a problem supporting trade deals. Most congressional Democrats voted against NAFTA in 1993. What's different now is that congressional Democrats are more liberal. ""Blue Dog'' and business-oriented Democrats were decimated in the Republican landslides of 2010 and 2014. In 1993, 40 percent of House Democrats voted for NAFTA. Last week, only 22 percent voted for TAA.The nation's growing disparity of wealth has made inequality a huge issue. Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities observed, ""Members from districts where there's nervousness, not just about trade deals, but about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages had a hard time saying yes.'' A lot of economists and businesspeople don't get the fact that trade is not just an economic issue. For most people, it's a moral issue. They understand that the country would probably benefit from free trade. They themselves would benefit from lower prices.But Americans are resolutely opposed to any policy that would throw Americans out of work. I have seen focus group discussions where people acknowledge that, as a result of free trade, they would be able to buy cheaper shoes or cars. But they are still troubled by the prospect of losing American jobs. ""It would just be wrong,'' they say.President Obama acknowledges that many lower-skilled workers will lose their jobs if they are forced to compete in a global marketplace. That's why trade adjustment assistance is needed. But Democrats are horrified by a policy that, whatever the benefits, would end up creating greater inequality. Members of Congress are independent political entrepreneurs. They're in business for themselves. A lame duck President can no longer do them much good. They have to run again, he doesn't. Moreover, congressional Democrats have bitter memories of what happened to them in 2010 and 2014 -- the ""Nobama'' midterms.The President's often disdainful treatment of Congress did not help. When Obama spoke to an emergency meeting of the House Democratic caucus, he accused them of cynicism. They were willing to cut off trade adjustment benefits in order to kill the trade deal.

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tells the story that when he first served in Congress, House Speaker Thomas P. ""Tip'' O'Neill, his Massachusetts colleague, urged Markey to vote for a energy bill that was unpopular in New England but important to President Jimmy Carter. The Speaker put his arm around Rep. Markey's shoulder and said, ""Eddie m'boy, I need your vote.'' Markey replied that he didn't think he could support the measure.The Speaker became more insistent. ""Eddie m'boy, I really need your vote.''""I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker,'' Rep. Markey responded. ""I just don't think I can vote for this.'' The Speaker racheted up the pressure. ""You have to understand, I really need your vote.''""Mr. Speaker,'' Markey replied. ""If you were right on this, you would have my vote. I just don't think you're right.''The Speaker pressed on. ""Eddie m'boy, if I were right, I wouldn't need your vote.''More than three quarters of House Democrats on Friday sent a message to President Obama: ""We know you need our votes, but we think you're just plain wrong on this.'' It all crumbled for Obama the moment Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi abandoned him. ""If TAA [Trade Adjustment Assistance] slows down the fast track, I'm prepared to vote against TAA,'' Pelosi said, leading Democrats to cast a solid ""No'' vote, 144 to 40.Democratic dissension on trade is nothing new. Liberals have always had a problem supporting trade deals. Most congressional Democrats voted against NAFTA in 1993. What's different now is that congressional Democrats are more liberal. ""Blue Dog'' and business-oriented Democrats were decimated in the Republican landslides of 2010 and 2014. In 1993, 40 percent of House Democrats voted for NAFTA. Last week, only 22 percent voted for TAA.The nation's growing disparity of wealth has made inequality a huge issue. Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities observed, ""Members from districts where there's nervousness, not just about trade deals, but about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages had a hard time saying yes.'' A lot of economists and businesspeople don't get the fact that trade is not just an economic issue. For most people, it's a moral issue. They understand that the country would probably benefit from free trade. They themselves would benefit from lower prices.But Americans are resolutely opposed to any policy that would throw Americans out of work. I have seen focus group discussions where people acknowledge that, as a result of free trade, they would be able to buy cheaper shoes or cars. But they are still troubled by the prospect of losing American jobs. ""It would just be wrong,'' they say.President Obama acknowledges that many lower-skilled workers will lose their jobs if they are forced to compete in a global marketplace. That's why trade adjustment assistance is needed. But Democrats are horrified by a policy that, whatever the benefits, would end up creating greater inequality. Members of Congress are independent political entrepreneurs. They're in business for themselves. A lame duck President can no longer do them much good. They have to run again, he doesn't. Moreover, congressional Democrats have bitter memories of what happened to them in 2010 and 2014 -- the ""Nobama'' midterms.The President's often disdainful treatment of Congress did not help. When Obama spoke to an emergency meeting of the House Democratic caucus, he accused them of cynicism. They were willing to cut off trade adjustment benefits in order to kill the trade deal. They were not ""playing it straight.''""Basically, the President tried to both guilt trip people and then impugn their integrity,'' Rep. Peter De Fazio (D-Ore.) said.

The activists were asking for a repeal of the Amendment which defines marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman, becoming the latest state to prevent same-sex marriages. (Photo by Sara D. Davis/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb802f82400003200572d79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) This week, North Carolina's legislature overrode its Republican governor's veto to allow magistrates and clerks to refuse to perform same-sex marriages.This unprecedented move -- never before have state employees been allowed to simply stop doing their jobs -- comes at a time of profound debate regarding same-sex marriage. It is exactly the wrong move.To be sure, same-sex marriage is a contentious moral and political issue. National support for marriage equality is now at 63 percent, but that means 37 percent still have doubts. And while some of that 37 percent may be bigoted or homophobic, a significant portion has sincere religious objections. As same-sex marriage may soon be the law of the land, why not accommodate those sincere believers wherever possible, so that they can enjoy their right to religious liberty?There are two important reasons why.First no constitutional right exists in a vacuum. Rather, rights exist in balance with other rights and other interests.Sometimes, those interests may be easy to set aside. In the 1990s, when a group of Native Americans were held to have violated drug laws because they used peyote in a sacramental ritual, Congress nearly unanimously passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to protect them. In this case, the competing interest was trivial (anti-drug laws were not meant to target religious ritual), no one else was harmed, and Congress took action.Other times, however, the competing interests are profound. In the 1960s, many business owners sincerely believed that whites and blacks should not marry one another, mix with one another, or even sit with one another in restaurants. Like today, some of these people were simply racist. Some, however, had sincere religious objections, and plenty of unambiguous Scripture to back them up.What should courts and legislatures have done? Should they have accommodated those religious objections, passing civil rights laws but exempting those with religious beliefs?Imagine what that would have looked like: separate lunch counters, segregated schools, and all-white neighborhoods. The exemption would have eaten the civil right itself. ""Separate but equal"" would have endured.Flash forward to today. Citing religious freedom, laws have been passed that allow private businesses to turn away gay customers, state-licensed adoption agencies to turn away gay families, and now state employees to turn away gay people who seek to legally marry. Is this real equality? Or is it something less than equality, in which case the exemption has overwhelmed the civil right itself?Some would say that LGBT people can simply find another magistrate to marry them; indeed, the North Carolina law requires that one be made available. This does mitigate some of the harm.But there might be other restaurants down the street, too. Does that make it okay for one to say, ""no blacks allowed""?Of course not. Even when alternative remedies are available, the public refusal violates the right to equal protection under the laws, as interpreted by the Civil Rights Act.And while African-Americans and LGBT people have very different histories and cultural positions, the offense caused by ""no gays allowed"" is basically the same.But what about that magistrate, forced to perform a marriage he or she finds religiously forbidden? Doesn't she have rights too?Yes -- and this brings me to my second main point. In a democracy, civil marriage is not a religious issue.To be clear, no one is saying religious institutions should have to accept, host, or bless gay unions, or any other marriage they may find objectionable.For example, the synagogue I grew up in refused to perform interfaith weddings. Does that violate the civil rights of the couple wishing to be married? Well, it does affect them, but the couple's right to get married wherever they want is trumped by the synagogue members' rights to freely exercise their religion.What goes on among religious people, and in religious spaces, is constitutionally as well as theologically sacred.But the courthouse is not a religious space, and the magistrate is not acting in a religious capacity. She is doing her job, which she took an oath to do.In fact, by obeying the law, she is following Jesus' commandment to ""render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and render unto God what is God's.""Same-sex marriage is only one of many marriages that some clerks may find objectionable. Suppose two divorced people marry one another. Some Catholics may believe that to be against God's law. But a Catholic magistrate is not a Catholic priest. He's not performing the sacrament of marriage. He's acting under secular, state law.Or suppose a 17-year-old girl marries a 60-year-old man. Some may find that religiously or morally problematic, but the state of North Carolina allows it.Or suppose a black man marries a white woman -- illegal in North Carolina until 1967, when the Supreme Court ruled such laws unconstitutional. Was that ruling incorrect? Should marriage clerks with sincere religious objections have been able to opt out?This is why North Carolina's governor, Pat McCrory, vetoed the bill. Not because he endorses same-sex marriage -- he doesn't. But because confusing civil and religious marriage undermines the rule of law.Here's what a believing magistrate in North Carolina should do when that gay couple approaches her window. She should understand that she is not wedding two people before God, but validating their legal marriage under the laws of the United States. She should feel blessed to be able to do so. And she should thank God that in our country, the two are not confused with one another.(Jay Michaelson is a columnist for The Daily Beast and author of the 2013 report ""Redefining Religious Liberty: The Covert Campaign Against Civil Rights."")"

I saw it in 3D, so my comparison is with the previous 2D versions, and it really comes to life in this format. But such dimensional matters aside, the plot is feasible enough to enable even the most skeptical viewer to willing suspend disbelief enough to accept the premise as plausible, which is the genetic engineering of a completely new type of dinosaur that never existed in the Jurassic. This was done under the advisement of the most famous dinosaur digger in the world, paleontologist Jack Horner, who has been the science advisor for the film franchise, including this latest installment.I've known Jack since the early 1990s when I first helped him dig up a dino on a site in Montana (it's much harder work to release the fossil treasure embedded in solid rock using dental picks than it appears in the film, in which workers easily brush away loose dirt with a small brush). When I arrived at Horner's camp I was surprised to come upon a patient historical scientist, sitting cross-legged before a cervical vertebrate from a 140-million year old Apatosaurus (formerly known as Brontosaurus), wondering what to make of it. A reporter from a local paper asked Horner what this discovery meant for the history of dinosaurs. Did it change any of his theories? Where was the head? Was there more than one body at this site? Horner's answers were consistent with those of the cautious scientist: ""I don't know yet."" ""Beats me."" ""We need more evidence."" ""We'll have to wait and see."" Horner's scientific thoroughness comes through on screen as the science behind Jurassic World paralleled that of his work on back-engineering a dinosaur from modern bird DNA because, we now know, there is no viable DNA available from the Jurassic period, not even left over inside Jurassic mosquitos embedded in amber, which was the premise of Michael Crichton's novel and Steven Spielberg's first film in the franchise, Jurassic Park. Instead, as Jack explained to me in an ""in conversation"" we had at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles a few days before the film was released, since we know dinosaurs evolved into birds, that means bird DNA contains the remnants of their dino ancestors. As Horner explained in his 2009 book How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to be Forever (and in his TED talk on de-extinction), you can turn on dormant genes to get them to build body parts, including a dino-like tail, snout and even teeth. Because of their availability, chickens work well, so Jack intends to build what he calls a ""Chickenosaurus."" As he told me, ""If we can reinstate ancestral characteristics in a bird to make a dinosaur, you can't have ancestral characteristics unless you have an ancestor. That is proof of evolution.""As if anyone needs proof of evolution. Unfortunately they do, at least in America, so films like Jurassic World serve another purpose of value to those of us concerned about the state of U.S. science education (we're usually ranked toward the bottom of the most prosperous Western industrialized nations in the world): science education. Subtly, but poignantly, the science of Jurassic World sneaks in evolutionary biology without calling it that. Take Hen's teeth. We've known for decades how to turn on the ancestral genes for teeth in a chicken (see Stephen Jay Gould's 1983 book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes), which would be impossible if all creatures were created in one brief burst of genesis six thousand years ago. Instead, genetic engineering is showing us how to find the genetic fossils of animal ancestry. This is now done through transgenics, as Horner explained to me: ""If you're going to try to make a dinosaur, transgenically is as good a way as finding ancestral genes. Transgenic dinosaurs are what we created in Jurassic World. We have a hybrid dinosaur that's a mixture of several types of dinosaurs, plus mixtures of genes from several types of animals."" The result is one of the most terrifying monsters in monster film history: Indominus Rex, a mix of T-Rex and Velociraptor, with a few other features thrown in for good measure, such as the cuttlefish h ability to create camouflage to match nearly any background environment. Horner continued his explanation as I pressed him for details about how realistic any of this is:We will make the dino-chicken-like animal pretty soon. We're moving pretty quickly, but making a dinosaur that would look like a Velociraptor would take a lot longer. The more genes we learn about, what they do, and how to turn them on and off, the closer we come. Jurassic World adds another feature not seen in the franchise before, and that is how to train a dinosaur. The film's hero employs the techniques used by animal trainers in venues like Sea World, so I asked Jack about this because these training techniques work on mammals. How would they work on reptilian creatures?We also know dinosaurs were social. For years, we've found dinosaur nesting grounds and evidence that they cared for their young. And birds live in social groups. That had to come from somewhere; I don't think they invented it on their own. But would they be intelligent enough to understand trainers' signals, such as the ""click"" system popular among Sea World trainers (as featured in the disturbing film Black Fish, about the training of Killer Whales)? Horner continued by puncturing yet another anthropocentrism:This brings up the whole intelligence thing with dinosaurs and this side of that [evolutionary] tree. We're so mammal-centric. We think we're so smart; we're even mammal-centric about where our brain is located -- in our heads. In the first Jurassic Park film reference is made to a ""blood sucking lawyer,"" so that made me wonder about the legal aspect of a place like Jurassic World, that services 20,000 customers a day. Horner:We know that dinosaurs are not that scary. You could have dinosaurs on the Serengeti. As long as you keep your windows up, you could go on safari and look at them. They're not going to tear open your vehicle to get you. Go see Jurassic World and learn some science, but mostly just have a good adventure because the film delivers that in spades."

25,ENTERTAINMENT,Why You Obviously Wanted To Be A Mary-Kate And Ashley Character Growing Up,Lily Karlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen_n_7573724.html,,2015-06-13,"382088 03: Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are launching a pocket planner designed specifically for girls, November 2000. (Photo by Newsmakers)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4c020240000500097ad7c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you grew up in the '90s/early aughts and ever once attended a sleepover, you are likely familiar with the beauty that is Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen original films. If you grew up in the '90s/early aughts and ever once turned on a television, you are likely also familiar with the joys of the twins' series ""Two of a Kind"" and ""So Little Time.""Basically, if you grew up in the nineties/early aughts, you likely straight up idolized Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen characters because they were the epitome of teen girl cool. (Not to mention the sisters themselves, but like, it's all related.)In honor of the twins' birthday on June 13, 1986, and the recent announcement that much of their content library will air anew on Nickelodeon to inspire a new generation of teen envy, The Huffington Post compiled all the reasons you obviously wanted to be a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen character when you were a youngster. 1. They had the chillest names.   Names have vibes. And Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen characters always had names with vibes that were chill as heck. This is potentially best exemplified by Chloe and Riley -- what we would give to have either one of these names -- which they used both in ""Winning London"" and ""So Little Time."" (And, as Gawker so astutely pointed out, were assigned to a different twin in each project ... possibly so both sisters got to feel the distinct cool vibe of each name?)The chill vibes of these names is not explainable by logic. But it is there -- and you know it's there. 2. They were in touch with their true selves.   Mary-Kate and Ashley characters often had opposite personalities that clashed in ways that inspired true hilarity. In ""New York Minute,"" for example, they played Roxy and Jane -- the former, a rocker, the latter an academic overachiever. Though the different characters often have to learn to understand each another, they don't apologize for being the way they are. As youths, weren't we all just trying to find our authentic identities? (Actually as adults too. Thanks for the guidance, MK and A!)3. Hair game on fleek.   No words necessary.4. They traveled.  ""Passport to Paris,"" ""Winning London,"" ""Our Lips Are Sealed,"" ""Holiday in the Sun,"" etc. The premise of most of the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen adventures had in some way to do with going to a new beautiful city (and probably accidentally getting involved in a weird crime ring by sheer misfortune).5. They always had prime love interests, no matter their locale.    Wherever they traveled, great crush prospects who were always also into the girls just appeared. For most of us humanoids, it's hard enough to find this while living somewhere full time. But in Olsen-character land, successful crushes grow on whatever trees are native to the region.6. They had chicken fights with hot guys.   OK, yes, this was only in ""Holiday in the Sun."" But we call BS if you say recreating this cool nighttime chicken fight wasn't, like, top of your summer goals list every year. (And, realistically, probably never achieved.) The Atlantis pool escapade was also just one of many times the twins' movie characters broke rules in pursuit of adventure, and even if they did get in trouble, they never got in enough to really sabotage their prospects. This kind of balanced rule-breaking that provides adrenaline-rush fun without severe consequences is not usually a possibility in real life. (Unless maybe you're as privileged as the ""Holiday in the Sun"" characters clearly were ...) 7. They always got around pesky-ass adults.   Parents getting in the way of you doing what you want to do is one of the most irritating parts of adolescence. But in Olsen movies and TV shows, parents' rules were basically just a suggestion. (They usually had no idea what was going on with the accidental international crime ring anyway. So it was best to IGNORE.)8. They both had an amazing partner in crime.    SISTERS FOREVER. "

There are wealthy environmentalists like billionaire Tom Steyer and Esprit clothing founder Susie Tompkins Buell; gay and lesbian donors like Fred Eychaner and Laura Ricketts; trial lawyers Arthur Schechter and Ira Leesfield; Hollywood and music industry movers and shakers like Haim Saban and Clarence Avant; and New York City hedge funders like Marc Lasry, Richard Perry and Blair Effron.While Clinton’s old network has stepped up, few of the 800-plus bundlers who helped President Barack Obama break fundraising records in his 2012 re-election campaign have hosted events for Clinton -- at least so far. The Wall Street Journal suggests that many more top Obama bundlers are signed up to raise money for Clinton. Most of those who have already declared themselves for Clinton are either past Clinton bundlers or gave to her 2008 campaign.These include Eychaner, a self-described “retired media executive” who first backed Clinton in 2008 before giving to Obama in the general election. In 2012, the wealthy Chicagoan raised over $500,000 for the president’s re-election campaign. On May 20, he brought Clinton to his Chicago home for a donor event that was expected to net $250,000. ""Everybody working together needs to make Hillary the next president,"" Eychaner told Bloomberg ahead of the fundraiser. David Cohen, the top lobbyist at Comcast and a major Democratic donor, was a $100,000-plus bundler for Clinton’s 2008 campaign and a $500,000-plus fundraiser for Obama’s re-election. He is set to host a fundraiser in Philadelphia for Clinton later this month.Billionaires Steyer and Lasry were bundlers for both Clinton's 2008 campaign and Obama's 2012 campaign. This May, they held separate fundraising events for Clinton in San Francisco and New York, respectively.Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the top Obama fundraisers in 2012, was listed as a host for Clinton at a Los Angeles fundraiser. He was a donor to her last presidential bid.""Hillary Clinton is grateful for the support of so many people who are contributing to the campaign because they know she'd be a great president who would fight to make sure the economy of tomorrow works for everyone,"" Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said in an emailed statement. ""We have made an effort to cultivate a diverse group of donors and bring new people onto the team. Hosts have been a combination of longtime Clinton supporters, Obama supporters and some who have never gotten involved in Presidential politics before.""There are few known big-money Clinton backers at this point who raised funds for Obama’s re-election in 2012 but did not give to or raise money for Clinton’s 2008 campaign.One such donor, Stonyfield Farms owner Gary Hirshberg, will host Clinton for a fundraiser at his New Hampshire home in July, but hasn't forgotten his earlier skepticism about the candidate.In an email to The Boston Globe, Hirshberg explained that he had “crossed the [R]ubicon” to become a Clinton backer. But, he wrote, “I am still counting on a serious conversation with [Clinton] later this month before I am fully and enthusiastically on board.” While Clinton may not be crossing over into the president’s younger and more diverse donor network, she has brought in a few new faces. Actor Tobey Maguire and his wife Jennifer will hold a fundraiser for Clinton at their Los Angeles home on June 19, while 30-year-old Box CEO Aaron Levie has announced his intention to raise money for Clinton in Silicon Valley. Record producer L.A. Reid and his wife Erica, both new to the political money world, hosted Clinton at their New York home for an event in May.Events in Los Angeles and New York have also brought out or will bring out a number of actors and singers, including Beyonce, Meghan Trainor, Stevie Wonder, Beth Behrs, Tony Bennett, Lady Gaga and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.But perhaps more notable is the way Clinton has been able to bring in those Democratic Party donors to her last campaign who kept their wallets closed to Obama’s re-election. In some cases, the return of these donors and their aversion to some of the policies of the Obama era will probably raise eyebrows within the party’s base.Perry, the New York-based hedge fund manager of Perry Capital and owner of the luxury department store Barneys New York, is a longtime Clinton supporter who backed her 2008 bid. He gave to Obama’s general election campaign in 2008, but did not donate to Obama's re-election or to any party committee in 2012.Instead, Perry provided at least $1 million to The Israel Project, a stridently pro-Israel nonprofit that has been one of the most prominent opponents of the president’s negotiations with Iran over the country’s nuclear programs. The Israel Project has not only voiced opposition to a potential deal with Iran, but is calling for new sanctions against the country while the negotiations are underway. For her part, Clinton has voiced support for the nuclear negotiations. Saban, an Israeli-American television producer who in November objected to the Iran deal while sharing a stage with Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, has hinted that Clinton is secretly opposed to them.“I can't reveal to you things that were said behind closed doors,” Saban told a reporter in April. “She has an opinion, a very well-defined opinion. And in any case, everything that she thinks and everything she has done and will do will always be for the good of Israel. We don't need to worry about this.” Two of the newly revived Clinton backers actually opposed Obama’s re-election. Dr. Eva Andersson-Dubin, the founder of a breast cancer clinic and wife of investor Glenn Dubin, contributed $20,000 to support Obama’s Republican opponent Mitt Romney. Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild backed Republican primary candidate Jon Huntsman and has repeatedly denounced the Obama White House.De Rothschild, a wealthy investor, was a leading anti-Obama activist among disaffected Clinton supporters after Clinton's 2008 primary loss. She endorsed the Republican candidate John McCain that year. De Rothschild has accused Obama of waging a “class war” and written that his policies are a “radical departure from the principles of the American dream.” Clinton is now running to continue or expand those policies.There is also a whole category of donors who were sidelined during the Obama era but will be reactivated for the Clinton campaign: lobbyists. Steve Elmendorf, a noted Democratic lobbyist and past Clinton donor who could not give to Obama’s 2008 or 2012 campaigns, reportedly attended a Clinton fundraiser in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn in May.Clinton is also attracting early support from Democratic Party lawmakers and other officeholders. Among those who have already appeared at fundraisers for her are Sens. Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Reps. Joe Crowley (N.Y.), Jim Himes (Conn.), Grace Meng (N.Y.), Ted Lieu (Calif.) and Karen Bass (Calif.) and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel."

(http://on.wsj.com/1HBJVrh)New York FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser declined to comment on the report.A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, New York, which is leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday evening.Nike was not immediately available for comment.Nike, the world's largest footwear maker, said in May that charging documents regarding the FIFA bribery scandal do not allege the company is engaged in criminal conduct. In another statement at the time, it did not confirm or deny that it was the company in the indictment but said it was cooperating with authorities.

Yemen's exiled president, Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi said his government will not negotiate with Iran-backed rebels at UN-sponsored peace talks due to open in Switzerland this weekend, in comments broadcast today. AFP PHOTO / MOHAMMED HUWAIS (Photo credit should read MOHAMMED HUWAIS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14ff4240000330076f5ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SANAA, June 13 (Reuters) - Nine people were killed when Saudi-led coalition warplanes bombed a district in the Yemeni capital Sanaa inhabited by relatives of ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh, residents and medics said.The air raid, which also wounded at least 60 people, came ahead of planned U.N.-sponsored talks in Geneva aimed at ending Yemen's civil war that has drawn in regional powers, including the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia.Residents said the warplanes had targeted vacant houses in Bait Me'yad, a district near the heart of Sanaa that is home to a number of relatives of Saleh, whose loyalists are allied with Houthi forces, the dominant armed faction in the conflict.Mohammed Yahya, an eyewitness, said two missiles struck two Saleh relatives' houses while the third crashed in the middle of the neighborhood, causing several casualties. Another witness said three explosions shook the neighborhood.""We felt as if the house was going to collapse over our heads,"" said the man, identified as Ali Ahmed. ""We ran, with the children, and hid under the stairwell. It was terrifying.""Medical sources said nine people who had suffered severe injuries died on arrival at hospital while 60 others were under care at three hospitals in the capital.The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency said most of the victims were women and children.In the southern port of Aden, residents said a dozen people were killed or wounded by Houthi shells fired into districts in in the north of the city. Residents of Aden's Mansoura district described houses being shaken by overnight explosions.Fighters in the Southern Resistance movement and supporters of Hadi had fended off Houthi efforts to advance from the north, Aden residents added.Saleh remains influential in Yemen through his control of the former ruling party, the General People's Congress, and the loyalty of many in the military, despite having stepped down after mass protests in 2011 against his long authoritarian rule.He subsequently made common cause with the Houthis, members of the Zaydi branch of Shi'ite Islam who seized control of Sanaa last September and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the Arabian Peninsula country.The Saudi-led coalition is trying to restore Hadi to power. The Houthis, who have advanced across wide areas of Yemen, say they are pursuing a revolution against corruption and Sunni Muslim militants, and deny any military or economic links with Iran, which also says it accords them only diplomatic support.Western powers and the Arab alliance fear Iran, via the Houthis, is trying to extend its regional influence into Yemen.The World Health Organization said on Friday that 2,584 people had been killed and 11,065 injured in the conflict, which has wrought a worsening humanitarian crisis.The United Nations said on Friday that talks between Yemen's warring parties scheduled for Sunday has been delayed by one day to Monday as one delegation was arriving late in Geneva.
