We never tire of hearing him gush about his ""perfect"" wife, Lauren Parsekian.But a recent comment the ""Breaking Bad"" star made to People magazine has us rolling our eyes -- just a little! ""It was the greatest experience of my entire life,"" he said of his wedding. ""And she's still with me, which is just fantastic. Four months strong. Marriage is easy."" Now, we're not sure how he meant this exactly. Perhaps he was being facetious? Either way, marriage is a lot of things, but ""easy"" certainly isn't one of them. The couple tied the knot in a Parisian-themed wedding in Malibu, Calif. in May 2013. They met at the Coachella Music Festival and shared their first kiss on a ferris wheel at the festival. And it seems that the couple is still very much basking in the newlywed glow.""I will be in the honeymoon phase until I leave this planet,"" Paul told People magazine in August. ""Getting married to Lauren was the greatest accomplishment of my life. I will be forever grateful.""Click through the slideshow below for photos from the couple's Big Day. Keep in touch!

But apparently, the news about their split didn't get around to everyone -- and that made for a really uncomfortable moment for Arnett at Sunday night's Emmys. While walking the red carpet, one interviewer reportedly asked the 43-year-old actor to dish on how he and his wife prepped for the award ceremony earlier in the day. His response? “I don’t really have a significant other… She doesn’t exist.”  (Via feytal-attraction.tumblr.com)Needless to say, it was a pretty awkward moment. Once the show began, Arnett and Poehler were spotted hanging out backstage in the greenroom while watching the telecast. Cutest divorced couple ever, right? Arnett has two children with Poehler, Archibald and Abel, and told Details magazine in May 2013 that the boys have provided him with happiness since the split. ""I'm 43, and I've found my happiness -- which is my kids,"" he said."
4,DIVORCE,Male Sexuality May Explain Why Men Cheat More Than Women,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/male-sexuality_us_5b9d89a3e4b03a1dcc8943b8,"When it came to self-control, there was no discernible difference between men and women.

And according to a new study out of Texas A&M University, it's males' stronger sexual impulses -- and not their lack of self-control -- that could be to blame.  Researchers conducted two studies, the first of which asked 70 male participants and 149 female participants how they had reacted to real-life sexual temptations in their past.""When men reflected on their past sexual behavior, they reported experiencing relatively stronger impulses and acting on those impulses more than women did,"" Natasha Tidwell, one of the study's authors, said in a press release.When it came to self-control, there was no discernible difference between men and women. Paul Eastwick, the study's co-author, said that cheating most often occurs when men fail to utilize their self-control and give in to their sexual impulses instead.""Men have plenty of self-control -- just as much as women,"" Eastwick said. ""However, if men fail to use self-control, their sexual impulses can be quite strong. This is often the situation when cheating occurs.""In their second study, the researchers used a rapid-response test on 326 men and 274 women in which participants were shown photos of potential romantic partners and asked whether or not they'd like to enter into a romantic relationship with that person. Participants were shown photos of attractive, or ""desirable"" people as well as unattractive, or ""undesirable"" people along with information on whether each person was a good or bad romantic fit. Interestingly, men were more likely to accept attractive people, regardless of whether the computer deemed them a good or bad match. According to the researchers, this indicates that men have a stronger impulse to become romantically involved with desirable individuals even if the relationship would be bad -- like an affair would be.This isn't the first time researchers have examined infidelity. A survey from August 2012 found that 66 percent of people think infidelity is most likely to happen at a work-related event. And a study from July 2013 found that some women carry designer purses as a way to keep their partners from cheating.Click through the slideshow below for even more fascinating divorce findings.
