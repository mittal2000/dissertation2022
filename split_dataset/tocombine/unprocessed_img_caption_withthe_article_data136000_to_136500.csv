Democrats have put pressure on Obama to extend deadlines for signing up.Americans wanting insurance by Jan. 1 have until Dec. 23 to enroll, and other uninsured Americans have to sign up by March 31, or face penalties.Several experts told Reuters it will be hard to independently assess on Saturday whether the site has met the administration's goals of functioning for most users most of the time, including handling 50,000 concurrent users.""There won't be anything you can tell from the outside,"" said Jonathan Wu, an IT expert and co-founder of the consumer financial website ValuePenguin.When the site opened for enrollment on Oct. 1, the widespread failures started with the simple act of trying to create an account. But now, any remaining problems lie much deeper within the site, he said.""We really have no idea what down-the-line-problems still may exist,"" including the system for paying insurers when a consumer enrolls in one of their plans, he said in an interview.

When asked about parallels he sees between Civil War-era America and today, Dylan told the magazine: ""Mmm, I don't know how to put it. It's like . . . the United States burned and destroyed itself for the sake of slavery. The USA wouldn't give it up. It had to be grinded out. The whole system had to be ripped out with force. A lot of killing. What, like, 500,000 people? A lot of destruction to end slavery. And that's what it really was all about.It's those last few words that caused the stir. Harking back to centuries-old religious conflict between the majority Roman Catholic Croats and the Christian Orthodox Serbs as well as further rivalry that sprang up during World War II, Dylan referenced the bad relations that exist between the two groups. Amid lingering memories of the Croatian War of Independence that lasted from 1991 to 1995, the France-based Croatian community group in question has brought a lawsuit after finding Dylan's comments unsettling.Europe's free-speech laws are stricter than those in the U.S., and the suit will move on to the next stages. Slate reports that it could take up to 18 months to settle, and if Dylan is found guilty, he may face a fine and formal sanction. With America's First Amendment rights, it can be hard to see how a comment like this would generate litigation, especially for a musician who instantly became known as a champion of the civil rights movement. Anthems like ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"" were synonymous with anti-war sentiments and the free-love iconoclasm that arose during the 1960s.[via Business Insider]"

Keep reading for Nye's responses to seven not-so-silly ""hypotheticals"" posed by HuffPost Science...1. If you could reengineer the human body, what is one thing you would change? I'd separate the waste disposal outlets from the reproductive systems a little more. Be good to have more durable quadricep tendons, as well--a personal issue, I admit.

I think you mean recreate with all the experiences and intellect of someone, who has already come into existence. I can't think of anyone, really. I am troubled by the notion that since we've discovered cloning, we perhaps could or should try cloning someone. A person is a result of a life lived with other people at a certain time in history. It's not a reproducible product. Cloning a person is a bad idea, because the offspring would be one evolutionary step behind his or her contemporaries. The key feature of sexual reproduction is that we get an offspring that is inherently different from the parents. Germs and parasites, which (or who) reproduce at extraordinary speeds, can't quite deal with the new mixture of genes. My O my…3. Imagine there's an open seat on the first mission to send humans to Mars. Would you sign up? It would depend on who's mounting the mission. A few of the proposals of late seem underfunded, to put it generously, and just unrealistic. This 1989 illustration from NASA shows artist's conception of a Mars outpost.4. If time travel were possible, what day/era would you want to get to? Why? What would you do? Whom would you meet?  I'd go for 250 years from now, after steps have been taken to address climate change and the world's human population has stabilized. I think my English would be intelligible that many years hence. I'd like to meet the human woman with the best smile and the best sense of humor on Earth. I claim that to have a good sense of humor, one has to be smart. A man can dream.5. If you could be any animal but a human, which animal would you be and why? A well cared for dog.6. If scientists were to create a real-life ""invisibility cloak,"" how would you use it? I'd disrupt climate change denier meetings.7. Would sex with a robot be cheating? In my view, we have sex robots already. Sex toys or ""marital aids"" are sold by the millions, to a large extent, as a substitute for cheating.Have any more questions you'd like to pose to Bill Nye?
