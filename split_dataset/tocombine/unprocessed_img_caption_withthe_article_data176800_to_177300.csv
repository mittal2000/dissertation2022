Seems whenever there's an economic downturn, buildings go to new heights. The Empire State Building went up in 1931 during the Depression. Similarly, Burj Khalifa topped out at 2,723 feet in 2010, deep into the Great Recession. When times are tough, nothing says stability like a big, solid structure. These mega-buildings are universally comforting and inspiring.Today's superlatives of architecture trend toward high-tech achievements, and emerging regional powerhouses like Asia dominate the list. The biggest LCD screen in Beijing and the largest tented structure in Kazakhstan reveal a new competitive race that was once measured in height, but is now marked by impressive advances in engineering.Such cutting-edge buildings put new tourism icons on the map, even as age-old examples of grand architecture continue to capture our imaginations. They remind us that the impulse to think and build big isn't a new one. Consider the Great Pyramids--the world's tallest structures for nearly four millennia--or Beijing's Forbidden City, which still holds the record for the world's largest palace complex and lures 12.8 million annual visitors.As architects strive to outdo each other and new cities and structures command recognition, the new motto remains evident: more is more. --Adam H.

To energize its base of evangelical and born again Christians, the Republican National Committee has asked that question. The RNC then answers by providing twelve passages from the New Testament that clearly indicate that Jesus would vote a straight Republican ticket:1. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink... I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me. Therefore I had no incentive to take personal responsibility for my life and I slipped into the 47 percent who believe they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. (Matthew 25:35-40)2. What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his favorite assault weapon? (Mark 8:36)3. And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the government bureaucracy, and began to cast out them that made oppressive rules and job-killing directives, and overthrew the tables of the government regulators. (Mark 11:15)4. So the last shall be last, and the first shall remain first. For redistribution is the greatest of all sins. (Matthew 20:16)5. It is easier for a camel to get through a needle's eye than for an illegal immigrant to enter into God's reign. (Matthew 19:24)6. Consider the hedge fund managers, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. (Mathew 6:28)7. Dire is your plight, you Keynesians, since you... seal up men's access to the heaven's reign... devour the inheritance of widows... scour sea and land to acquire on adherent and then make him twice as fit for hell as you are."" (Matthew 32: 16)8. You cannot serve both God and Planned Parenthood (Luke. 16:13)9. Then he said to them all: ""Whoever wants to be my disciple must pass the Tea party litmus tests on abortion, stem cell research, global warming and repeal of the 16th Amendment."" (Luke 9:23)10. When you pray, be not like the pretenders, who prefer to pray in the synagogues and in the public square, in the sight of others. In truth I tell you, that is all the profit they will have. But you, when you pray, go to nearest public school. That is where prayer belongs. (Matthew 6:5-6). 11. Happy you who are the 1 percent, for heaven's reign is yours... But dire your plight, you who are the 99 percent, for your time of comfort is over. And don't even get me started on the 47 percent who pay no income taxes. (Luke 6:20-24)12. You must love supply side economics with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: 'Love tax cuts as yourself.'

People are making the decision to put those off because the assurance of a return to investment is",2012-09-23,"Statues of unemployed men standing in a unemployment line during the Great Depression at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt(FDR) Memorial September 20, 2012 in Washington, DC. During the first four years of FDR's term, nearly one-third of the American people were unemployed. AFP PHOTO / Karen BLEIER (Photo credit should read KAREN BLEIER/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d4792100002501c79dee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - When Daniel McCune graduated from college three years ago, he was optimistic his good grades would earn him a job as an intelligence analyst with the government.With a Bachelor of Science degree from Liberty University in Virginia, majoring in government service and history, McCune applied for jobs at the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies.But after a long hunt that yielded only two interviews, the 26-year-old threw in the towel last fall, joining millions of frustrated Americans who have given up looking for work.""There's nothing out there and there probably won't be anything for a while,"" said McCune, from New Concord, Ohio. He has moved back home to live with his parents, who are helping him pay off his college debt of about $20,000.""I don't like it, it's embarrassing. I don't want to be a burden to my parents,"" said McCune, adding that he felt like a high school dropout.Economists, analyzing government data, estimate about 4 million fewer people are in the labor force than in December 2007, primarily due to a lack of jobs rather than the normal aging of America's population. The size of the shift underscores the severity of the jobs crisis.If all those so-called discouraged jobseekers had remained in the labor force, August's jobless rate of 8.1 percent would have been 10.5 percent.The jobs crisis spurred the Federal Reserve last week to launch a new bond-buying program and promise to keep it running until the labor market improves. It also poses a challenge to President Barack Obama's re-election bid.The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one has fallen by an unprecedented 2.5 percentage points since December 2007, slumping to a 31-year low of 63.5 percent.""We never had a drop like that before in other recessions. The economy is worse off than people realize when people just look at the unemployment rate,"" said Keith Hall, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia.The participation rate would be expected to hold pretty much steady if the economy was growing at a normal pace. Only about a third of the drop in the participation rate is believed to be the result of the aging U.S. population.SLOW PROGRESSThe economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the 2007-09 recession and has so far recouped a little more than half of them.Economists say jobs growth of around 125,000 per month is normally needed just to hold the jobless rate steady.Given the likelihood that Americans will flood back into the labor market when the recovery gains traction, a pace twice that strong would be needed over a sustained period to make progress reducing the unemployment rate.Last month, employers created just 96,000 jobs.Roslyn Swan lost her job in 2007 as a portfolio associate at a financial firm in New York. After submitting hundreds of applications, the 44-year-old is taking a break.""Maybe after the elections,"" Swan said of her next attempt to get work. ""I know that I will be employed again. I don't know when, but I know it will happen.""Americans of all ages are leaving the workforce, but the problem is most acute in the 20-24 age group, where the participation rate has plunged by 4.4 percentage points since December 2007.Many Americans typically start working in their teens, taking part-time jobs after school and over summer vacations, a tradition that is supposed to instill a work ethic. With many failing to secure jobs after graduating from high school and college, analysts worry about U.S. competitiveness.""Because of delays to their career, the skills set accumulation that normally happens in the first or third job is not happening,"" said Paul Conway, president of Generation Opportunity in Washington, a non-profit, non-partisan organization that works with 18- to 29-year-olds on economic issues. TOUGH ON YOUNG WORKERSLast month, the proportion of 20- to 24-year-olds in the labor force was its lowest since 1972. Other age categories are faring little better. The 25-54 age group has seen a decline of 1.8 percentage points since December 2007.Some, like 27-year-old Casey Potts, have gone back to school. She is studying nursing in Kentucky after losing her medical sales job.""If I had stayed in medical sales, I would be job searching now,"" said Potts.But separate surveys by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and Generation Opportunity found little evidence that young people were going back to school when unable to land a job.One deterrent is the rising cost of education and record levels of student debt. About two-thirds of 2012 college graduates left school in debt, owing on average $28,700 in student loans, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org.""Young people dropping out of the labor force to go back to school would be a silver lining if it were true,"" said Heidi Shierholz, a senior EPI economist, adding that enrollment had gradually been increasing for decades.A Generation Opportunity survey published in August showed a third of young people were putting off additional training and post-graduate studies because of the sour economy.""This is significant. People are making the decision to put those off because the assurance of a return to investment is not there,"" said the non-profit's Conway, a veteran observer of the labor market as a former Department of Labor chief of staff.He said his organization found that young people were doing unpaid internships at nonprofit groups and businesses to prevent their skills from atrophying. Others were joining the military.Some economists say the participation rate does not paint a true picture because people find work in the informal sector, ranging from legal activities such as child care to crime in some cases.""People are picking a buck here and there and not being reported in anybody's payroll,"" said Patrick O'Keefe, head of economic research at J.H. Cohn in Roseland, New Jersey.""They will say they are not doing anything, even as they have a job and are being paid under the table,"" said O'Keefe, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Labor Department. ""We do not know to what extent that is going on."""

This is, as she notes, partially just a fad and partially a fad driven by changing thinking about health, fat, ""superfoods,"" and the like. But it's also a trade policy story.After all, it's long been the case that Californians slap avocados on everything. I remember visiting the Golden State in the mid-'90s having rarely eaten avocados in New York, taken aback to find them on basically every burger and sandwich in sight. The issue is that avocados were grown in California and at that time couldn't be exported from Mexio. After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was ratified in 1994, Mexican avocado growers had high hopes of cracking the American market. But avocado protectionists argued that the importation of Mexican avocados would introduce a particular kind of fruit fly.Over the course of the aughts, some parts of the United States that are too cold for fruit flies were opened to Mexican imports and since 2007 USDA inspectors have been on the ground in Mexico and Mexican avocados are cleared for import everywhere. Not coincidentally, we're experiencing a boom in avocado consumption over the past five years. In the long run, NAFTA worked and now Americans can enjoy this delicious treat. Mexico, meanwhile, has steadily moved up the value chain and now is a major industrial exporter alongside the avocados."

I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could,"" Feige said, before throwing some cold water on the notion. ""We certainly are not even going to attempt that until 'Avengers 2.' So there's a lot of time to think about it.""Prior to ""The Avengers,"" Marvel tried to launch Hulk as a solo franchise in the vein of ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America"" and ""Thor."" However, both the 2003 and 2008 films weren't financial successes, leaving Hulk as a character without a home until ""The Avengers.""Despite Feige's last-second hedge about waiting until after Joss Whedon completes ""The Avengers 2,"" the Marvel chief's comments are actually an indication of some forward progress on a third Hulk film. Back in April, before the record-setting grosses for ""Marvel's The Avengers,"" Feige told HuffPost that no plans were in motion.""This was the other shot, right?"" Feige asked when questioned about Hulk. ""I mean, this was the third appearance of Hulk and everything that we had and were going for, we put in to Hulk's appearance in 'Avengers.' So, I love that people are saying that and are feeling that way about Hulk, but mission accomplished at this point.""For now, however, fans should simply expect to see Hulk in ""The Avengers 2"" and that's all. Ruffalo told Vulture that he had spoken to Whedon about the sequel and is expected to return.For more, head over to MTV.[via MTV]"

I program performances as well as talks and gallery tours at the Met Museum.How long have you been at The Metropolitan Museum of Art?I came to the Met last July -- so just over a year ago. Before that I was the adjunct curator for performance at the Whitney Museum. I would like to express my gratitude for being included in 2012- 13 season of your program. In addition, I think it is wonderful DJ Spooky has taken up residence. How does the artist in residence work? This is a first for the museum correct? First of all, I'd like to express gratitude to you, Kalup, for agreeing to embark on this idea with us, and for introducing Kaye to the world in the amazing setting of the Met's European Sculpture Court! What a perfect setting for the artist Kaye to be introduced to the world! Also, much of the credit for bringing your performance to the Met goes to Ian Alteveer, one of the curators of the Warhol Show (Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years). He was the one who first said ""yes"" to the idea of performance being part of the exhibition, and he was also the one who was enthusiastic about us inviting you to perform. I'm not sure I could have pulled this off without Ian's support. Your performance was not only brilliant, but it also extended the notion of Warhol's relationship to Portraiture, which is a huge theme in the exhibition.   Photo by Eileen TravellThis season we are introducing a new artist residency to the Met: DJ Spooky is an omnivorous artist and thinker. His breadth of knowledge and curiosity is immense and that's why I thought he would be a great artist to invite to be the (yes) first-ever artist-in-residence at the Met Museum, to ""remix"" the museum, and create some new performance works using ideas and objects from our collection and special exhibitions. Over the next year, he will present five multimedia performances, as well as many talks, tours, and workshops both with general museum audiences as well as invited audiences (such as K-12 teachers). This will be a tremendous opportunity for us in the museum to interact with and learn from a living artist, and for the artist to have such an expansive playground to create in. The residency kicks off on October 26 with a performance of Madame Freedom, a multimedia piece that uses an iconic Korean film as its starting point.What are some of the other highlights coming in the next few months? I see plenty in conjunction with the Warhol exhibition.I was really lucky that in my first year at the Met, I got Warhol as a topic! It was fairly easy and loads of fun to develop both gallery tours, talks, lectures and performances with Warhol as the organizing principle. Patti Smith will be performing a program she calls Warhol's World on Sept. 28 and on Oct. 6, we are hosting the band Dean and Britta, who will perform ""13 Most Beautiful: Songs for Andy Warhol's Screen Tests."" On Oct. 2 we are hosting a conversation with Andy Cohen, one of the creators of reality TV, talking about Andy Warhol as the father of reality TV. And the choreographer Miguel Gutierrez will lead a tour of the exhibition, giving his own artistic interpretation of the work.

Can you tell us more about the new direction the museum is taking in regards to contemporary art?I think you will see more living artists interacting with the museum. My department deals with performing artists, and I'm eager to give artists opportunities to interact with the museum and its collections. From Bill T. Jones giving a tour of the new American Paintings Galleries to DJ Spooky developing multimedia work with our curators, this is an exciting new endeavor for us. Is there anything else you would like to add or fill us in on?I am incredibly grateful to you, Kalup, for your willingness to experiment with us, and to create a performance specifically for our space!

Three other pitchers continue to ramp up their rehab from UCL reconstructions performed in 2011 by pitching this month in simulated games, in the instructional league and in the minors. These figures do not include those who returned to major league competition in 2012 following earlier surgeries.The ulnar collateral ligament is the primary stabilizer of the elbow. Pitchers place undue stresses on the medial (inner) elbow, and this excessive loading of the region can impact not only the UCL, but can also create inflammatory conditions in all of the structures in the area. These include the wrist flexor muscles (which are in the forearm but attach at the inner elbow), the forearm pronators (which turn the palm downward), the elbow joint capsule, and the ulnar nerve. The repetitive demands of pitching and the nature of the motion itself -- particularly the acceleration phase -- are the primary culprits. The end result of moderate UCL sprains (Grade 2) is laxity (looseness) of the ligament, which results in joint instability. This instability causes even greater stress on the surrounding tissues. Even after the cumulative trauma of less significant Grade 1 injuries (microtears), ligaments may be weakened and tissues prone to inflammation. At worst, they could tear further. Additionally, other degenerative changes, such as bone spurs may result. A severe sprain (Grade 3) is actually a complete tear of the ligament. These may occur traumatically, as with one pitch as claimed in Stephen Strasburg's case, or in the event of elbow dislocation. However, for many, earlier injuries set the stage.Dr. David Altchek, orthopedic physician for the New York Mets, and co-chief of the Sports Medicine and Shoulder Service at New York's Hospital for Special Surgery, pioneered a radical modification of the Tommy John procedure that is now the gold standard. The original surgery, first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 on Tommy John, then of the L.A. Dodgers, involved using a tendon graft harvested from the patient and weaving it in a figure eight pattern through channels created by drilling three holes into the bone. To do so, muscles were detached and the ulnar nerve had to be moved. The newer technique, known as the docking procedure is less invasive, entails splitting the muscles rather than detaching them, requires that only one hole is drilled and allows the ulnar nerve to remain in place. Success rates exceed that of the traditional approach, though pitchers still are progressed cautiously and on average return to competition just prior to the anniversary of surgery. Success is determined by restoring pre-injury levels of performance rather than time to return. What are your thoughts on Washington's decision to limit Strasburg's innings in his first season back from Tommy John surgery?"

Green. So do NFL cornerbacks.Out of the 169 cornerbacks who were on NFL rosters as of last Tuesday, only 53 of them were 6-0 or taller.It’s not because NFL teams don’t want tall cornerbacks. They do. They just can’t get them.“Those six foot corners are hard to find,” one AFC personnel director said. “Other than quarterback, cornerback has become one of the most important positions on the field, and everybody wants them, especially the tall ones.”Everybody wants them because so many receivers have to duck when they go through doorways. There were 106 receivers on NFL rosters last week who were 6-0 or taller, or exactly twice the number of 6-0 corners.Some teams emphasize height at the cornerback position more than others. The Steelers, for instance, are tall cornerback hogs with four corners who are six footers, and their fifth, Curtis Brown, is a shade under six foot tall. Other teams with multiple tall corners include the Seahawks, Jaguars, Eagles, Packers, Bills, Giants, Rams, Ravens, Bengals and Panthers.When Nick Saban was coaching the Dolphins, he wasn’t interested in a cornerback who wasn’t at least 5-11.Patrick Peterson has height, reach and ball skills--which is why he is the ideal cornerback. An NFC personnel man pointed out that if a corner is tall and has speed, change of direction skills, willingness to tackle and ball skills, he is a top 10 pick—like Patrick Peterson of the Cardinals. But there aren’t many like him.“We’ve been trying, but how many come out every year?” Seahawks general manager John Schneider said. “Guys who can really drive, there’s maybe three or four. There are a lot of taller guys who can’t break on the ball that well.”So teams look for different ways to acquire tall corners. Schneider found Pro Bowler Brandon Browner in the Canadian League. The Eagles tried a varied approach, drafting Curtis Marsh, trading for Domique Rodgers-Cromartie and signing Nnamdi Asomugha as a UFA. The Jaguars drafted Rashean Mathis and Derek Cox from schools that were off the beaten path, Bethune-Cookman and William & Mary.Every team prefers height at the position. But it’s not as necessary for some, depending on the techniques they ask their cornerbacks to play. Teams that press a lot need bigger corners. Zone teams can get away with having quicker, smaller cornerbacks as long as they are tough and can play the ball in the air.Some teams prefer a combination of taller and shorter corners so they can use different coverages and match up with different types of receivers. For all the benefits of taller cornerbacks, the large majority of them can’t mirror, change directions and burst like shorter ones.“You can’t expect a corner who is over 6-0 to move like a 5-8, 5-9 guy,” Jaguars general manager Gene Smith said. “They aren’t going to have the same fast twitch, so there is some give and take. We are looking for bigger corners, but we don’t want to compromise speed in doing so. Sometimes the bigger corners aren’t as fast and are tighter in the hips.”It is no coincidence that four of the five corners who had the most defensive holding penalties in 2011 were tall ones: Stanford Routt (6-1) had eight, Antonio Cromartie (6-2) had five, Browner (6-3) had four and Ike Taylor (6-1) had four. The only cornerback with at least four holdings who is not 6-0 is Orlando Scandrick, at 5-10.Many teams are willing to live with a tall cornerback’s deficiencies because they can neutralize wide receivers. “They force the quarterback to be more accurate because they cover up some of the receivers,” Smith said. “There are some big receivers out there, but in general there is less surface for the quarterback to throw at with a big corner. Bigger players present a bigger obstacle to throw around.”This is particularly beneficial in the red zone. “Shorter corners tend to play fairly well between the 20s, but when you get in the red area, the bigger corners can be more of an asset with jump balls and things of that nature,” Smith said.One front office man said his team is fine with 5-10 corners as long as the player has long arms. Having long arms enable a cornerback to play taller than he is. “They can reach for balls downfield, reach for balls coming back and compete better for contested balls,” Schneider said.Long arms help a corner in press coverage too. It’s difficult for a short-armed corner to get a good jam and then turn and run because he has to get too close to the receiver.A cornerback with 32 inch arms is ideal. Trumaine Johnson is 6-1 ½ and has arms that measured 33.6 inches. That explains why the Rams made him a second round pick in April. He could develop into an ideal matchup corner against big receivers.If he does, Johnson will give the Rams what every team is looking for.Things I Didn’t Used To Know*In August Joe Flacco turned down a big offer from the Ravens and his contract will expire after the season, but that does not mean he will be a former Raven anytime soon. Barring an unexpected flameout from Flacco on the field this year, everyone familiar with his situation expects him to remain a Raven. Agreeing to a new deal remains an option, as does the franchise tag. Flacco is not the type of athlete to get agitated about the contract talks, so there is little consternation about the situation. The Ravens do not have a history of negotiating with players in-season, but they could make an exception for Flacco if Flacco indicates an interest to do a deal.*Kellen Winslow can give the Patriots some of the things Aaron Hernandez gives them, but not all of the things. Front office men who have evaluated Winslow recently say he has lost some speed and can’t get downfield the way he used to, or the way Hernandez can. But Winslow still has the ability to separate in a short area, as Hernandez does. If his knee holds up, Winslow can give Bill Belichick another chess piece.My Sunday Best: Strongest ArmsThe strongest armed passers are not always the best passers. You will notice some of the league’s best quarterbacks, including Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Eli Manning, don’t make the cut on this list. But there is something to be said for pure arm strength. Here, with a little help from some front office men, are my Sunday best arms.1. Jay Cutler, Bears. His throwing motion is inconsistent, but he can put some real mustard on the ball almost any way he gets rid of it. Jets coach Rex Ryan is on record saying he thinks Cutler has the leagues strongest arm. CBS analyst Dan Dierdorf said during a broadcast that Mike Shanahan told him Cutler’s arm was stronger than John Elway’s.2. Joe Flacco, Ravens. He throws the best comeback in the league. The beauty of Flacco’s arm is that he has perfect mechanics and is an easy thrower. There is no strain in his passes. Interesting point: he has a much stronger arm than Matt Ryan, who was chosen 15 spots ahead of him in the 2008 draft.3. Matthew Stafford, Lions. He can be late getting off a throw and still be fine because he puts so much velocity on it. The dropoff begins after Stafford.4. Cam Newton, Panthers. He might win a throwing contest for who can get the ball to land farthest. Drawback: he has a long release.5. Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers. He can throw hard even when he’s on the move. Roethlisberger is a big, strong man who can put his body into his passes.6. Jake Locker, Titans. He can drive it on short to intermediate passes, and he can go deep with a tight spiral.7. Tarvaris Jackson, Bills. If he had as much accuracy as he does arm strength, he would not be on his third team in two years.8. Aaron Rodgers, Packers. He was not regarded as an exceptionally strong-armed QB coming out of Cal, but he has improved his arm strength in the NFL. He has a whipping throwing motion, but he makes all throws. Rodgers’ quick release helps.9. Josh Freeman, Bucs. He has a cannon but he also throws a catchable ball.10. Michael Vick, Eagles. He isn’t the biggest quarterback, but he throws big, and he throws effortlessly.One Man Yelp: Head GamesHead Games is a documentary you don’t want to see but should see. It’s important and it makes you think. And being able to think is not something anyone who has played football should take for granted.The film examines the concussion crisis that has gripped football as well as other sports such as hockey, soccer and lacrosse. It was inspired by the book with the same name written by former Harvard defensive tackle and WWE wrestler Chris Nowinski, who is featured prominently in the movie.Nowinski is a crusader who is helping to make sports safer after 12 months of post concussion syndrome ended his wrestling career. And sports are becoming safer. That’s the good news. The bad news is there are generations of athletes who are going to have life-altering, if not life-ending consequences from head injuries that went undiagnosed and untreated.Some of the most moving segments of the film center on former NFL players Isaiah Kacyvenski and Gene Atkins. Kacyvenski, who suffered two concussions three weeks apart when he played for the Rams, recalls being allowed back in a game 20 minutes after not knowing where he was. Then he suffered another head injury, and was taken off the field on a stretcher.Atkins, the former Saint and Dolphin, has suffered cognitive damage and was filmed struggling to state the months of the year. He has attempted suicide multiple times.All of this can be alarming to a parent of a son playing football. Which, coincidentally, is what I am. “Personally if I had a six year old playing football, I would be freaked out, because you are playing Russian roulette with their future,” Nowinski says in the film.My hope is that a film like this and the discussion and concern it creates will help reduce head injuries in the future.Hot Reads*When Steve Sabol left us, the NFL lost what may have been its greatest ambassador. Thanks, Steve, for memories that will last forever.*In terms of how the Bucs are attacking kneel downs, it’s not just opponents who have to be concerned about injuries—it’s Bucs defensive linemen.*I have no problem with Jeff Ireland telling off an obnoxious fan. Being employed by an NFL team does not mean you should have to accept whatever kind of verbal abuse someone can dream up and have no recourse but to take it.*Not only is RGIII not in the Big 12 anymore, but neither, apparently, are the Rams, Seahawks, Cardinals and 49ers.*Wonder if Randy Moss will find a little surprise in the 49ers’ postgame spread at the Metrodome.*If you are a fan of an 0-2 team, cheer up. It’s not so bad being 0-2 when you are two games behind only six teams in the entire league. It’s a 1-1 world.Dan Pompei covers pro football for the Chicago Tribune at chicagotribune.com."

Just an educated guess.",2012-09-22,Young caucasian woman throwing a clothes from the wardrobe back.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c51453c00004c0009b67d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm no feng shui expert, but I'm pretty sure that holding onto a wedding gown from a failed marriage may keep me from meeting the man of my dreams. Just an educated guess. Over the past couple of months, I've cleaned out every closet, drawer and cupboard in my house. A local handyman built out shelves into two of my closets, and I've hauled four carfulls of stuff to a local charity.My ex-husband had a shopping problem and a spending problem and a hoarding problem and a messy-as-fuck problem. Some of those problems were painfully familiar to me from my childhood. The amount of money being made had little to do with the amount of money being spent. The net result was that I felt out of control of our finances, and by proxy, my life. Equally frustrating: my quality of life overall suffered through my constant battle against a steady inflow of stuff that cluttered our home. Now the apartment is all mine. My income -- all mine (save for the 90 percent that is spent on my kids). My bills are mine and they all get paid on time! And after this cleansing, I have more space than I know what to do with. I also have a grip on how much I have, how much I need to buy, a sense of what I want to buy -- and how much of that I can afford.I'm a spiritual person. I don't answer a religion per se (I like to say that I have no problem with any religion -- just the ones that suck), but I spend a lot of time thinking about a higher being. I also believe that things have power. Whether photographs and travel trinkets physically contain energy, I don't know. But there is power attached to the ideas that things represent. And when things represent bad times or people who make you unhappy, it is time to get them out of your house. Open up space for good things.Cases in point: In recent months I purged my wedding gown (beautiful, but I just can't see myself wearing it on a date anytime soon, and I wouldn't encourage a loved one to re-wear a frock that represents a failed relationship); a folder stuffed full of handwritten lists and clippings from Martha Stewart Weddings that I'd saved from my nuptial planning seven years ago; and a beloved quilted silk coverlet for my bed -- again used for various activities of interest to married people (like fighting before going to sleep).To be clear, I have many, many great memories from my marriage, and I have zero regrets about marrying the man I did. But I'm not married to him anymore. It's time to move on.The cleaning extended to personal items, work-related clutter and sorting the pantry. One huge upside of all this organizing and tossing is that you find out what is lurking in the dark reaches of your home. For example, I found I have six tubes of toothpaste and 23 florescent lightbulbs -- gadgets designed to last half my lifetime. I have a half-dozen lamps in my house.So what good came of all this work? In general, I feel a sense of lightness and control as I look at my kitchen cupboards and know just what selection of grains and spices are at my disposal for dinner. When I needed a certain drill bit the other day, I knew exactly where to find it. In the past I would have clenched up at the thought of slogging through a giant drawer of hardware and left the window blinds uninstalled. There is a serenity that comes with knowing that I have more than enough, and yet am closer to the leaner, more purposeful life that I crave.But there have been other, less tangible changes that I believe are rooted in this house cleanse. On the work front, I launched a blog, which I've been talking about for months and months (thanks to my many friends and family members for putting up with me). And on the personal side, I've been able to step away from a relationship that wasn't right for me. Perhaps I closed some doors to my marriage that I didn't realize needed addressing. And I've found enthusiasm for dating again.You could argue that I was simply ready to make these life changes, and the cleaning just stemmed from those motives -- that could be entirely true. But let me tell you -- there is something truly cathartic about handing over a sangria-soiled silk wedding gown to the less fortunate knowing that you never have to inadvertently catch a glimpse of it -- and all that it represents -- when digging through the linen closet for -- please, please God be there! -- Pedialyte.Now, if anyone in the greater New York City metro area needs a florescent lightbulb, give me a shout. Pick-ups only, please.A version of this post first appeared here. "
