Nonetheless, there are plenty of deserving players who didn’t make it this season because popularity and reputation play a role in the selections. Here’s my team of players snubbed for the Pro Bowl, which will be played on January 25 in Glendale, Arizona.OffenseQB-Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks RB-Justin Forsett, Baltimore Ravens FB-Anthony Sherman, Kansas City Chiefs WR-Odell Beckham, New York Giants WR-Golden Tate, Detroit Lions TE-Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers T-Andrew Whitworth, Cincinnati Bengals T-Sebastian Vollmer, New England Patriots G-Joel Bitonio, Cleveland Browns G-Evan Mathis, Philadelphia Eagles C-Rodney Hudson, Kansas City ChiefsThe unconferenced format really hurt Wilson, as only two NFC quarterbacks were selected. The league’s top dual-threat quarterback is 15th in the NFL in rushing with 842 yards and has a 95.7 passer rating (ninth in the NFL). Forsett leads NFL running backs with 5.3 yards per carry and his 14 runs of over 20 yards tie him with DeMarco Murray for the most in the NFL. The NFL’s sixth-leading rusher (1,147 yards) has also been named AFC Offensive Player of the Week twice this season.Beckham is among the NFL’s most productive wide receivers since recovering from a hamstring injury that kept him out of the Giants’ first four games. During the second half of the season, Beckham leads the NFL with 858 receiving yards and is second in receptions (61) and receiving touchdowns (8). Tate has set career highs with 96 catches and 1,286 receiving yards. The Lions aren’t in the playoffs because they don’t go 3-0 without Calvin Johnson if Tate doesn’t catch 24 passes for 349 yards with two touchdowns in those games Megatron missed. Whitworth anchors the offensive line and hasn’t given up a sack this season.DefenseDE-Michael Bennett, Seattle Seahawks DE-Everson Griffen, Minnesota Vikings DT-Muhammad Wilkerson, New York Jets DT-Sheldon Richardson, New York Jets OLB-Khalil Mack, Oakland Raiders OLB-DeAndre Levy, Detroit Lions ILB-Dont’a Hightower, New England Patriots CB-Sean Smith, Kansas City Chiefs CB-Corey Graham, Buffalo Bills FS-Devin McCourty, New England Patriots SS-Antoine Bethea, San Francisco 49ersStuffing the run was undervalued in this year’s selections. Bennett is Pro Football Focus’ (PFF) top rated 4-3 defensive end against the run and is also second among all defensive ends with 68 quarterback pressures (combined sacks, hurries and hits). 3-4 defensive ends Richardson and Wilkerson were listed on the Pro Bowl ballot at defensive tackle. Wilkerson was PFF’s No. 2 rated 3-4 defensive end this season before being sidelined for three games (Weeks 13-15) with a toe injury, which opened the door for Richardson to move into the slot. Mack quickly established himself as a dominant force against the run. The lack of sacks (only four) contributed to him being overlooked, but the rookie matches Connor Barwin with 54 quarterback pressures and has more than Clay Matthews (48) and Tamba Hali (42).Levy has been a tackling machine (third in NFL with 140 tackles) for the NFL’s second-ranked defense in total yards and points allowed. Patrick Peterson was a reputation pick, as he’s given up eight touchdowns this season. As the NFL’s highest-paid cornerback, Peterson should be limiting quarterbacks to a 48.4 completion percentage for a 56.5 passing rating when targeted like Graham.SpecialistsK-Matt Bryant, Atlanta Falcons P-Johnny Hekker, St. Louis Rams PR-Adam Jones, Cincinnati Bengals ST-Kelcie McCray, Kansas City ChiefsBryant has the most field goals from 50 yards and beyond in the NFL this season, with seven. Overall, he has converted 90.3 percent of his field goal attempts (28 of 31), which is fourth in the league. Jones may have gotten a berth if kickoffs were still a part of the Pro Bowl. He’s leading the NFL with a 33.2-yard kickoff return average and is third in punt returns (11.9 yard average).Follow me on Twitter: @corryjoelJoel Corry is a former sports agent who helped found Premier Sports & Entertainment, a sports management firm that represents professional athletes and coaches.

Organizations will announce over 600 new actions to help more students prepare for and graduate from college during the day action, according to the White House.

The details were sketchy, but the projected plan would institute a rating system of colleges and universities nationwide. The stated purpose of the plan is to hold institutions of higher education accountable to consumers, especially in the areas of access, affordability, and outcomes.The president promised to solicit ample input from all interested constituencies before unveiling the actual plan, and he charged the Department of Education with holding public forums and working out the plan's details. The outline of the plan originally presented by the president drew substantial criticism from university leaders, some public officials, and numerous professional organizations. Nineteen of the nation's most important and influential professional organizations representing higher education (such as the American Council on Education, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities) cosigned a letter to the administration expressing serious reservations about the plan.Despite receiving a huge volume of input on the proposed plan -- the overwhelming amount of it negative -- Department of Education officials apparently have made little change to the proposed plan, judging from the ""framework"" of the final plan released by the administration just this month. The plan still proposes to rate colleges using metrics that are problematic, if not seriously flawed. On the surface, several of the metrics sound reasonable, but a close examination reveals a system with very little nuance or awareness of context. Take completion rates, for example. As I point out in an earlier post, while we all want more college students to earn their degrees and graduate, using a simple statistic of how many of an institution's full-time students graduate in six -- or, worse, four -- years does not account for how the demographics of the college student population has changed in the last several decades. It would be entirely reasonable to expect a high percentage of a college's students to proceed smoothly through four or so years of school and graduate ""on time"" if that population were composed primarily of students from relatively affluent families and who were not the first in their family to attend college -- as was the case 30 or 40 years ago. Such students enjoy significant family and financial support and don't typically need to work while attending college.Today, however, many of our students are the first in their families to attend college; many are people of color, or citizens of other countries; some are single parents or products of them; females outnumber males; and a large number of students are older than traditional age. Given this demographic, many students -- perhaps the majority -- have no choice but to work while they are attending college. Needless to say, holding down a job -- even a part-time job -- while attending college full time significantly decreases a person's likelihood of sailing straight through four years of college to graduation. The recent large influx of military veterans into the ranks of college attendees also makes today's student population nothing like that of the Father Knows Best years. Vets often bring their own challenges to college life, including problems with sustained concentration and struggles with post-traumatic stress, and so this subpopulation needs extra support to help them succeed and to do so in a timely fashion.As currently formulated, the proposed ""reform"" plan will use a stark completion percentage devoid of any accounting for personal, institutional, or demographic context. As such, it is hardly a useful statistic for rating colleges -- not to mention that it could become an incentive for some colleges to lower their standards in order to boost their completion rates.Another misguided metric still included in the plan despite widespread criticism is ""labor market success,"" meaning tracking the salaries of just-graduated students and comparing that average to those of other institutions. The recently published ""framework"" admits that this metric drew the most criticism and states that an attempt will be made in the final plan to devise instead a ""substantial employment"" metric, but even this misses the point. Tracking how much students earn is misleading and will contribute to a skewed ""rating"" of institutions. The students graduating from an institution heavily oriented toward the arts and humanities, for example, will likely be entering relatively low paying professions. In contrast, students graduating from a college with a heavy orientation toward health care professions or engineering will be earning considerably more.  Many of the metrics in the proposed reform plan are equally misguided, but I will not address them here. My larger point is that the architects of the plan need to pay closer attention to the input they receive. The proposed plan at its best will be grossly misleading and at its worse will be actively destructive to the extent that it incentivizes colleges to make poor choices for the wrong reasons.Better yet, perhaps the administration should scrap the proposed plan altogether and instead adopt a version of an already existing system operated by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities called the University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN), a website designed to offer prospective students and their parents ""concise, consumer-friendly information about the nation's private, nonprofit colleges and universities in a common format."" Why reinvent the wheel?"

North Korea has compared Obama to a monkey and blamed the U.S. for shutting down its Internet amid the hacking row over the movie ""The Interview."" (AP Photos)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0462240000500054d0be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The racial taunt by North Korean official's of President Obama as a monkey was no real surprise. The regime has blasted Obama before with border line racial jabs. Obama is the most visible and inviting target for North Korea to single out for blame and vitriol after its bare bones Internet and mobile phone networks were disrupted for a few days. North Korean officials apparently saw this as retaliation for allegedly hacking Sony picture executive's internal emails. It's hardly the first time that some official or official source in North Korea has gotten caught with its racial dirty linen waving. Last May, the Korean Central News Agency drew fire when it lambasted Obama with the admonition to ""live with a group of monkeys in the world's largest African natural zoo."" North Korean officials deny that there is any explicit intent to racially demean Obama. They contend that the criticism is simply part of the ongoing war of words between two countries. The verbal war is the outcrop of the deep suspicion, distrust, antagonism, and confrontation that's characterized relations between the U.S. and North Korea for decades.It is true that North Korea has leveled choice verbal derogatory broadsides on foreign leaders it considers hostile overtly to the regime. A prime example is its attack last August on U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. It called him a ""wolf donning the mask of sheep."" This jab at Kerry was in response to Kerry allegedly calling for peace at the same moment the U.S staged its annual military drills with South Korea. The wolf characterization was harsh but that's an image that's more in keeping with a not uncommon vilification of someone who's seen as predatory. North Korean officials have also called South Korean President Park Geun-hye a prostitute. This too was insulting and demeaning. But that's also a common usage epitaph often hurled at supposedly on the make politicians.These types of insults, no matter how disreputable and loathsome, at least make some political sense. The continual reference to Obama as a monkey is something else. It shouldn't surprise, though, that North Korea would latch onto that image. They are just following playing on the stereotype that the pack of race baiting websites, chat rooms, some college frat parties, and student websites has frequently used in assorted offbeat, crude, vile cartoons to ridicule Obama and First Lady Michelle and African-Americans. The racial tie to that depiction was tested in 2007.Then Penn State researchers conducted six separate studies and found that many Americans still link blacks with apes and monkeys. Many of them were young and had absolutely no knowledge of the vicious stereotyping of blacks of years past. Their findings with the provocative title ""Not Yet Human: Implicit Knowledge, Historical Dehumanization and Contemporary Consequences,"" in the February 2008 issue of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, was published by the American Psychological Association.The overwhelming majority of the participants in the studies bristled at the faintest hint that they had any racial bias. But the animal savagery image and blacks was very much on their minds. The researchers found that participants -- and that included even those with no stated prejudices or knowledge of the historical images -- were quicker to associate blacks with apes than they were to associate whites with apes.This was not simply a dry academic exercise. The animal association and blacks has had devastating real life consequences. In hundreds of news stories from 1979 to 1999, the Philadelphia Inquirer was much more likely to describe African Americans than Whites convicted of capital crimes with ape-relevant language, such as ""barbaric,"" ""beast,"" ""brute,"" ""savage"" and ""wild."" And jurors in criminal cases were far more likely to judge blacks more harshly than whites, and regard them and their crimes as savage, bestial and heinous, and slap them with tougher sentences than whites.North Korea would be especially susceptible to trade in this type of crude race baiting, and name calling given its self-imposed isolation from global discourse and its near paranoid xenophobic view of itself as somehow an ethnically pure nation. This notion is deeply tinged by race and racial chauvinism. This, and the regime's political insularity, inevitably instills in the regime an us versus them fortress wall to keep out anything that sullies its notion of its superiority. North Korean leaders have played hard on this for decades as a political serving mechanism to insure domestic control and compliance with its brutal policies. There was some talk that former NBA player Dennis Rodman's much criticized tour of North Korea earlier in 2014 with a team of mostly black former pro basketball players might dent the regime's racial insularity. There is no evidence it did. It gave the regime a momentary PR boost, but it was passing. An apologetic Rodman got the message and vowed not to return to the country. It wouldn't have mattered. Two months later it branded Obama as a monkey and now it has repeated the slur. For North Korea this is simply racial business as usual.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

Now some of the reported 26 who had been scheduled to travel to Singapore from Surabaya, Indonesia, are sharing their stories.A mother of three told Bloomberg that her family was among the no-shows after a last-minute decision the night before not to travel. They were headed on vacation to a Singapore water park, but nixed the trip after a grandparent fell ill. Chandra Susanto, the father of the family, told the Daily Mail that he only found out about the missing plane after his sister called in a panic after the news broke. While thankful for missing the flight, Susanto expressed deep condolences for those on board. Another report via the Jakarta Post told of an even closer call, as a family of 10 narrowly missed the flight due to a unseen email. The flight, they say, had been originally scheduled for later in the morning but was rescheduled to depart earlier. When the family arrived at the airport, they found they'd missed takeoff by about 10 minutes. Only an hour later they learned that the plane they would have boarded had disappeared. The names of both families correspond with those on a reported passenger manifest, which lists 23 no-shows, along with three children in arms, who did not board Flight QZ8501. The plane, which lost contact at 7:24 a.m. Singapore time, had 155 passengers and seven crew members aboard when it departed. The passengers, from five different nationalities, include 16 children and one infant."

While Smith has had quite a distinguished career with roles in acclaimed films like ""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie,"" for which she won an Oscar, ""A Room With A View,"" and the recent ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" films, perhaps her most memorable role is that of the nosy, pushy, caustic family matriarch at ""Downton Abbey."" While millions of viewers tune in to see the drama unfold, Smith herself says she has never watched the show. She says what she gets out of the role is simply ""the delight of acting."" We're pretty sure the pleasure is all ours, Dame Maggie. Besides seeing what becomes of the Grantham ladies' love lives, the upstairs/downstairs relationships and apparently, a cameo appearance by none other than George Clooney, we're looking forward to seeing what the Dowager Countess has up her sleeve next, whether it's bickering with Mrs. Crawley or battling with new technologies.

I wanted to read stories about the good family men, role models and community leaders they undoubtedly were. Yes, such profiles were written. But it is a different kind of story that is dominating the Internet: the scapegoating of people who did not kill them. The prime target has been Mayor Bill de Blasio. With some NYPD officers turning their back on de Blasio during Officer Ramos' funeral on Saturday, tensions rose to new heights. But why this anger, this personal sense of blame, so pointedly directed to de Blasio? Because he publicly spoke his truth about what a parent feels compelled to tell a Black child. Many resent de Blasio for voicing the need to caution his Black son on the suspicions he may be subject to. We vilify de Blasio for expressing his reality instead of listening to him and working to change why parents need to have ""the talk.""This moment could be a chance to start listening. Only hearing each other's experiences -- as cops, as parents, as young people -- will allow us to find a way forward towards trust. That is the only path that gets us to what all parties want: a better relationship between law enforcement and communities they serve and, of course, less violence. I imagine people of color know all too well what de Blasio just found out: that voicing a personal truth about race in America must be weighed against the potential cost of doing so. How defensively will it be received? What will be the price for expressing it? But how can we solve a challenge as profound as racism if we don't even let each other speak? If we have our backs turned to each other and refuse to listen?What protestors are doing is giving collective voice to their experiences. They are expressing fear that society values their life less because of skin color, that they are more likely to face excessive -- even lethal -- force. And are we going to listen to what it's like to be a cop, a job that could cost you your life at any moment? Police have a hard job with constant danger and they've seen horrible things. They didn't sign up to be seen as racists; they want to be seen as human, as protectors in a perilous job. We can -- and should -- accept hard and conflicted truths from people on both sides of the divide. Let's not be threatened by one or the other. There is no need to choose sides, especially until we have listened, paused, and pondered a bit. What we must not do is use tragedy as an excuse to silence those who just want to be treated equally. Protestors wanted the deaths of Liu and Ramos no more than they wanted the deaths of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice or anyone else.De Blasio has been exceptionally evenhanded in his respect for police while trying to help us grasp the perspectives of people of color. To think otherwise is to dismiss the lived experiences of these communities. He has tried to be a true friend to the NYPD, in the sense of a friend who believes in you enough to be critical when you can be better.New Yorkers elected de Blasio because he was candid about raising his biracial son, and now some want him to resign for doing that very same thing. There is a better way of hearing his truths, and those of so many other people, in order to know the changes we must make.We've progressed to a point where people do not want to be considered racist, but we haven't yet solved the underlying effects of racism in all of our assumptions, fears and resentments. So it becomes challenging to have the candid conversations needed to move us closer to the country we want to be. If we start from an understanding that people on both sides want to reduce violence against innocent people, and that their life matters, we can get somewhere. There are changes that must happen to increase trust and we can get there. Let's support a process based on simple respect for protestors and police, which surely begins with the ability to listen. If we can stop blaming each other for things we are not responsible for, maybe we can work together on solving the things for which we are all responsible."

(AP Photo/Binsar Bakkara)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd3b42200005700db230a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Gayatri Suroyo and Charlotte GreenfieldBANDA ACEH, Indonesia/JAKARTA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Overwhelmed by fear, members of the main gay rights group in the Indonesian town of Banda Aceh started burning piles of documents outside their headquarters in late October, worried that the sharia police would raid them at any moment.Indonesia's northernmost province of Aceh had weeks earlier passed an anti-homosexuality law that punishes anyone caught having gay sex with 100 lashes. Amnesty International criticized it, saying it would add to a climate of homophobia and fear.""We are more afraid, of course,"" said a 31-year-old transgender person who, along with three other members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) group, Violet Grey, burned the pamphlets, group records and other papers.""As an institution, Violet Grey went as far as removing all documents related to LGBT. We burned them all,"" said the group member, who declined to be identified out of fear of being arrested.The province's tight-knit gay community, estimated by some at about 1,000 people, has become increasingly marginalized since Aceh was allowed to adopt Islamic sharia law as its legal code.Aceh was granted special regional autonomy as part of a 2005 peace agreement ending a three-decade old separatist insurgency.After the anti-homosexuality law was passed in September, Violet Grey began warning its 47 members to keep a lower profile and for gay and transgender people to avoid going out together as couples in public.No one has been arrested under the law, which Aceh officials say will not be enforced until the end of 2015 to allow residents time to prepare for it. But this has not eased the fear in the gay community.Even before the law, life was not easy for gay people in the most religiously conservative part of Indonesia, the north of Sumatra island where Islam first arrived in the archipelago.The gay community is a target of regular harassment from sharia police and residents. Transgender people are particularly vulnerable because of the difficulty of concealing themselves in public.In 2011, a transgender make-up artist was stabbed to death in Banda Aceh after she held up a stick in response to a man's taunts. OTHER PROVINCES TO FOLLOW?Aceh authorities defend the law, saying it does not violate human rights because gay people are free to live together but just can not have sex.The law also sets out punishment for various acts apart from gay sex including unmarried people engaging in displays of affection, adultery and underage sex.""It is forbidden because in the sharia context, the act is vile,"" Syahrizal Abbas, the head of Aceh's sharia department, which drew up the law, told Reuters.""It brings unhealthy psychological impact to human development, and it will affect the community.""Outside Aceh, Indonesia is generally tolerant of gay people, particularly in urban areas like Jakarta.Engaging in homosexual acts is not a crime under Indonesia's national criminal code but remains taboo in many conservative parts of the country, which has the world's largest Muslim population.Gay rights groups fear other conservative provinces, such as South Sumatra and East Java could follow Aceh's lead if Indonesia's new president, Joko Widodo, does not step in and overturn the law.Widodo's administration is reviewing the law to see whether it violates human rights but it can only request changes and cannot overturn it, said Teguh Setyabudi, the home ministry's head of regional autonomy.The Violet Grey member hopes the law will eventually be overturned so she can walk home without watching her back in fear.""Being like this is our fate, not a choice,"" she said.""What makes people wearing a jilbab and peci feel so righteous that they can condemn other people as sinful?"" she asked, referring to a woman's veil and a traditional Muslim cap worn by men.(Additional reporting by Reza Munawir in Banda Aceh; Editing by Randy Fabi and Robert Birsel)"

Problem is, many part-time jobs don’t come with benefits. But that’s not true at all companies.Below are five national employers that offer part-time workers competitive starting pay, health insurance, employer-matched retirement benefits, product discounts and industry perks. The health insurance coverage could be an especially desirable benefit until Medicare kicks in at age 65.StarbucksThe ubiquitous coffee chain offers an impressive package of health benefits and incentives that makes part-time employees who meet certain qualifications feel like stakeholders in the business, just as full-timers do.After you put in 240 hours over three consecutive months (the equivalent of four hours a day, five days a week, for example), when you work at least 20 hours a week, you’re eligible for full benefits, including health, dental, vision, life insurance, disability and a 401(k) match.And you don’t need to be a twentysomething to get a part-time job here. We “recruit and hire partners without regard to age,” says Laurel Harper, a Starucks corporate representative.Part-timers who meet the preceding qualifications can contribute 1 to 75 percent of their pay to the Starbucks 401(k), with an annual limit of $23,000 for people 50 or older. Starbucks matches 100 percent on the first 4 percent of pay and all contributions have immediate vesting.Starbucks funds about 70 percent of health-premium costs for employees and covers 100 percent of preventive care services. Policies cover a wide range of non-traditional treatments, including acupuncture, chiropractic care and homeopathic care options. There’s also mental health support and an emergency assistance fund that helps cover expenses after a natural disaster or a family crisis.Starbucks also lets employees buy company stock at a 5 percent discount through payroll deductions and provides a 30 percent in-store discount as well as a weekly pound of free coffee or tea.You can find more details about Starbucks benefits here.UPSSusan Rosenberg, UPS Public Relations Director, says her company employs “many retirees who are looking for the next chapter and seek reduced hours that have benefits.” The primary part-time positions, she notes, are for package handlers who load, unload or sort within the operations.“Age isn’t really an issue; its ability and desire to do the job,” says Rosenberg.Part-time UPS employees must work only 15 hours a week to be eligible for health benefits. Coverage begins on the first day of the first full pay period following 30 days of employment and includes health, dental, vision and life insurance, as well as a discounted prescription drug program.And if you’d like to take college classes when you’re not working at UPS part-time, the company offers $5,250 in annual tuition assistance, up to $25,000 during employment there.The company also has eldercare spending accounts to help reduce your caregiving costs and lets qualifying part-timers buy UPS stock at a discount. Look here for a detailed description of UPS benefits and eligibility requirements.REIIf you enjoy the great outdoors, REI — the outdoor recreation gear, sporting good and clothing giant — might be a good place for your part-time work in retirement.The company subsidizes up to 96 percent of insurance premiums for employees who work 20 hours or more a week, pays the full cost of basic life and disability insurance and offers vision and dental insurance.REI also lets part-timers contribute up to 75 percent of pay to the company’s 401(k), with a match that starts at 3 percent and increases 1 percent per year of employment; maximum employer match: 10 percent. (You need to be in the plan for at least five years to keep the employer match money.) The annual employee contribution amount for people 50 and older tops out at $22,500.If you’re a nature-lover, REI’s 50 percent discount on gear may be motivation enough to work part-time for the company.Another perk: REI offers a 50 percent, pre-tax subsidy for commuting on public transportation.Look here for a detailed description of REI benefits and eligibility requirements.Whole Foods MarketThe popular grocery chain Whole Foods “welcomes people seeking part-time employment,” says Michael Silverman of the company’s public relations department.If you work there 20 hours a week or more, after 800 hours (that’s 10 months of 20 hours a week) you can get health insurance for $0 to $15 a month — the actual cost of your premiums depends on how long you’ve worked at Whole Foods. Part-timers are also eligible for dental, vision, life insurance and paid time off.And you can get up to $1,800 a year to help cover the cost of deductibles and other qualified out-of-pocket health care expenses not covered by insurance through a Whole Foods Personal Wellness Account or Health Savings Account.As a recent Bloomberg BusinessWeek article noted, the Whole Foods 401(k) isn’t especially generous, though. The maximum company match is just $152 a year and you need to work there a year to receive any match.Part-timers also get a 20 percent discount on most in-store purchases and the company shares its wealth through stock options (for part-timers who’ve worked the equivalent of three years full-time) and a “gainsharing” program that rewards teams based on performance.Look here for a detailed description of Whole Foods benefits and eligibility requirements.The Container StoreNext Avenue recently republished an article by Café.com’s Deborah Copaken about getting rejected for a job at The Container Store at 48. But the chain’s spokeswoman Casey Shilling says her company is “always looking for great employees of any age, career background and life experience that can make connections with our time-starved customers and who are eager to be part of a team that delivers exceptional customer service.”The Container Store provides part-time employees with medical, dental, life and vision insurance, as well as short-and long-term disability insurance. (Life insurance coverage is extended to domestic partners and common-law spouses). The company offers discounted pet insurance, too.Employees are eligible to participate in The Container Store’s 401(k) plan after working there 11 months and can contribute between 1 and 80 percent of gross pay. There’s a 4 percent employer match.You can also get a 40 percent discount on merchandise and 30 percent off installation fees.Look here for a detailed description of Container Store benefits and eligibility requirements.

But the truth is, when a new year rolls around, it's nice to take stock and see what you could start doing differently. The usual suspects here are diet and exercise, and often such resolutions are overzealous and set us up or failure. So this year I'm here to help boost you up with some totally doable style-related resolutions that will require very little of your time.Read on for this year's top 10 style resolutions.1. Try one new thing with your wardrobe. It can be easy to find one thing that you're comfortable in and that feels easy to you. But it can also be really boring! Give 2015 a fighting chance and add some sort of new element to your look -- maybe it's starting to wear more color, or swapping out your logo'd/free event t-shirts for something nicer (here's my guide for how your t-shirt should fit).  2. Don't shop without a plan (or on an empty stomach). The last thing you want to do when shopping is make mistake purchases. And shopping without knowing what you're looking for -- or when you're hungry -- will put you on the fast track to a shopping fail.3. Donate anything with holes or stains that won't come out. This one really doesn't need explaining. I'll just say that when you wear torn-up, crappy clothes, the message you send is that you feel torn-up and crappy about yourself. This then becomes an unfortunate vicious cycle which causes you actually to start feeling that way.4. Take your oversized clothes to the tailor. This is an instant, low-cost (at least compared to buying new things) option for upgrading your wardrobe.5. Think before you stink (a.k.a. avoid strong aftershaves). This one was on last year's list, but I had to include it again. I did a lot of traveling in 2014, and one of the biggest conclusions I drew is that there's an Old Spice epidemic in the US. Nearly every morning flight I took, I felt as if I might become asphyxiated by the scent of the man sitting next to me. Trust me, just because you can't smell it doesn't mean others can't either. Ask one or two lady friends with good taste to tell you honestly if any of the product smells you're wearing are offensive. And if the initials for any of said products are O.S., drop it like it's hot.6. Wear a watch. I get it, watches are no longer necessary since we all use our phones these days. But if you're not wearing a watch, you're missing out on an excellent opportunity to distinguish your look. Above is a serious arm party courtesy of one of my clients. You don't need to break the bank when adding a watch to your look, however. There are plenty of good choices under $200 (including this one for $185 from Miansai). Choose something that resonates with you personally and that you'd feel good wearing -- not what others would expect you to wear.7. Make sure you have one suit that fits you like armor. Chances are, sometime in 2015 you'll have a wedding, funeral, or job interview you'll need to attend. And you'll need a great-fitting suit for those situations -- one you don't have to think twice about. Often such events spring up out of nowhere, so it's to your benefit to have a suit ready and waiting in your closet. And if you think you can get by with that old boxy one from ten years ago, think again. There are few things less flattering on a man than an ill-fitting suit, and there's definitely no way to disguise a poor fit.  8. Buy flattering jeans. Most new clients I meet are in need of a jeans refresh. Even if you have a pair that was flattering when you bought them two years ago, chances are at this point they've stretched and faded, and it's time to replace them. If you've never had a pair of jeans you feel great in, it's time to add that to your wardrobe. Here's my guide for how to find flattering jeans.  9. Lose the square-toed shoes. These were cool in the 90's. But the 90's is not now. Do yourself a favor and get them out of your closet so you aren't tempted to wear them.  10. Take your dress shoes to the shoe guy for a cleanup and to be resoled. This is another low-cost way to refresh things, and in fact a good cobbler can make your shoes look almost new. If you don't already have someone you use, look on Yelp or other user-review sites in your area for one with high ratings, or ask any well-dressed guys you encounter where they take theirs.  How many of the tips on this list are you able to implement? I guarantee that even if you do just 3 of them, you'll be in great shape, and you'll feel that much better about yourself. Wishing you a very stylish 2015!"

Fearing further reprisal, Sony decided to cancel the film's Christmas Day release. ""When we were told we couldn't play it, I flipped out,"" recalled Michael Furlinger, the Plaza's owner. Furlinger's sentiments were echoed throughout the country, notably by a programmer at the Alamo Drafthouse theater and the President of the United States, who said, ""We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States."" Consequently, on Tuesday--two days before Christmas--Sony reconsidered, allowing a limited release of the film. Jubilant Plaza employees added big red letters spelling out ""Freedom Prevails"" to their marquee, then took to the Internet to share the news. Or, rather, they would have taken to the Internet. But it hadn't been working for more than a day. ""We heard from AT&T Cares that service was down in the area,"" Furlinger said. The outage precluded the Plaza from selling tickets Tuesday and Wednesday via the Web, or to moviegoers and other First Amendment fans lined up at the box office hoping to pay with credit cards. Nevertheless, the Plaza sold out all 1300 seats. Service remained down yesterday, costing the Plaza between $2,000 and $3,000 at the concession stand, where 80 percent of patrons use credit cards.""These things never happen on slow weekends,"" Furlinger lamented this afternoon.The obvious question is whether North Korea, whose own Internet was reportedly shut down this week by the United States in retaliation for the Sony hack, is behind the Plaza outage. FBI agents present at the Plaza's Christmas Day screenings didn't think so. Nor did Furlinger, who began to explain that the Internet had gone down before he received the go-ahead from Sony. Furlinger had to cut his explanation short, however, upon learning that he had a phone call ""from the office of the president.""It was the president of AT&T.The Plaza Theatre in Atlanta (photo: Plaza Theatre)"
