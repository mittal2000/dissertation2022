The high tops were laced by the lockers with care, In hopes that Carmelo soon would be there.The reserves were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of Jill Martin danced in their heads. And STAT in his street clothes and Woodson his goatee, Had just settled the game plan: defend, shoot the three.When out on 33rd, there arose such a clatter, I sprang from Row G to see what was the matter. Down to the lobby I flew in a hurry, Threw open glass doors, wide enough for Eddy Curry.The moon on the hoods of bright-yellow cabs Gave the lustre of Time Square to Seventh and Eighth Aves. When, what to my eyes should appear, But the Knicks Groove Truck, with eight hoopsters fleet-footed as deer.With a tall, lithe driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Knick. More rapid than Celtics his teammates they rose, And he whistled, and shouted the names sewn to their clothes!""Now Felton! now, Chandler! now, Brewer and Kidd! On, Novak! On, Pablo! on J.R. and Shumpert! To the top of the Atlantic! to the top of the East! Now dash up! Dash up! No longer last, nor least!""Unlike lottery teams that before the young Thunder fly, When they meet with the Heat, these Knicks mount to the sky. So up the standings these 'bockers they flew, With the record full of wins, and Kurt Thomas too.And then, in 24 seconds, I heard trumpeted by Clyde Frazier The posting and toasting of each orange-hued sneaker. As I went to the parquet floor, and was turning around, Down from GardenVision, Melo came with a bound.He was dressed in home whites, positioned on the wing, And his uniform was bulked up by that flak jacket thing. A bundle of shots and points if needed for a comeback, And he looked like Bernard, only the crown did he lack.His eyes how they twinkled! jumpers he did bury! His tattoos tell stories, his grin like a victory! His wide droll mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the thin beard of his lip was as precise as his free throw.On the 25th of December he welcomed Kobe in from the West, With a national audience, each wants to assert he is the best. They had won a gold medal on team with each as a member, As Olympians in London before Training Camp began in September!Melo was long and strong, as sturdy and solid as a tree, And I cheered when I saw him, yelling M - V - P! A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon let others know the Mecca was somewhere to dread.He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And dropped 30 points, then turned with a jerk. He posterized a defender and held, for a moment, a pose,  Giving a nod as up to the rim he rose!He slammed the ball down, to his team gave chest pounds, And away they fast broke, quick as speeding sounds. But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove the lane, ""Happy Knicksmas to all, and to all a good-night!"""

They have",2012-12-25,"San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh walks off the field after the team lost to the Seattle Seahawks in an NFL football game, Sunday, Dec. 23, 2012, in Seattle. The Seahawks won 42-13. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6c802210000d601c8cef0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Jim Harbaugh kept his sentences short and information at a minimum Monday, repeating a phrase he will rely on following the worst loss of his NFL coaching career: ""Regroup, refit and reorganize.""That's all the San Francisco 49ers can do at this point.Beat up and down, San Francisco's 42-13 blowout loss at Seattle cost the 49ers (10-4-1) more than just a game. They have another pair of key starters questionable with injuries, let control of a first-round playoff bye slip away, and head into Sunday's regular-season finale at home against Arizona (5-10) with a half-game lead in the NFC West.""No excuses or justifications,"" an overwhelmingly grim, tight-lipped and humbled Harbaugh said back at 49ers headquarters. ""Our team needs to bounce back.""The only way the 49ers can secure a No. 2 playoff seed — and the first-round bye that comes with it — is a win against the Cardinals coupled with a Green Bay loss at Minnesota. If they lose and Seattle (10-5) wins at home against St. Louis, the Seahawks will steal the division and send San Francisco on the road for the first round.Complicating matters even more, the 49ers enter the finale with their depth depleted.Wide receiver Mario Manningham, bothered by a shoulder injury previously, limped out of the locker room Monday on crutches. He was scheduled to have an MRI exam on his left knee after he was tackled low by Leroy Hill and fumbled in the third quarter.Tight end Vernon Davis must clear the league's NFL concussion protocol after getting knocked off his feet along the sideline by safety Kam Chancellor on a huge hit that looked legal but drew a penalty for thumping a defenseless receiver.And defensive lineman Justin Smith's streak of 185 straight starts ended when he sat out with an elbow injury. Harbaugh remained mum on Smith's status, except for saying ""he has not undergone a procedure."" Asked if Smith will need surgery at some point, Harbaugh would only say ""we'll see.""San Francisco already had lost backup running back Kendall Hunter (lower leg), wide receiver and punt returner Kyle Williams (left knee) and defensive lineman Demarcus Dobbs (right knee) to season-ending injuries. Defensive lineman Will Tukuafu added to Harbaugh's headaches when he hurt his back against the Seahawks and did not return, and backup linebacker Clark Haggans missed the game with a shoulder injury.""I feel our team's leadership, I feel the intellect of the staff, I think the talent of the players, the work ethic of the players will pave the way,"" Harbaugh said.There are still plenty of problems for the 49ers who are healthy.Seattle's loud fans flustered quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the coaching staff from the start, forcing the 49ers to call two timeouts and get two delay-of-game penalties in the first half alone. Kaepernick completed 19 of 36 passes for 244 yards and a touchdown with one interception in the end zone.What do the 49ers have to do offensively to avoid penalties and clock-management problems?""Fix it,"" Harbaugh said.""That's the only option we have,"" left tackle Joe Staley said. ""You learn from the film, you watch it and make the corrections. Our whole team didn't play well.""Frank Gore was held to 28 yards on six carries after rushing for a season-high 131 in San Francisco's 13-6 win against Seattle in Week 7. The loss of Justin Smith seemed to affect the entire defense, and Russell Wilson's slipperiness in the pocket didn't help. Aldon Smith is still stuck on 19 ½ sacks after getting locked up by Seattle's Russell Okung.Red Bryant also blocked David Akers' 21-yard field-goal attempt, Richard Sherman scooped up the ball and sprinted untouched for a 21-0 lead that put the game out of reach.""Rather than go position by position, or any one particular phase, I don't think anybody looks back on this and feels like it was good enough,"" said Harbaugh, handed a miserable loss on his 49th birthday by longtime rival and Seattle coach Pete Carroll.If there's a bright side to San Francisco's setback, Harbaugh is 7-0 after a loss in his two-year tenure and competition will not be nearly as difficult as the last two weeks at Seattle and New England.The 49ers routed the Cardinals 24-3 in the desert on a Monday night in late October, a game Alex Smith completed 18 of 19 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns. Smith has since been replaced by Kaepernick, a high-risk, high-reward, dual-threat quarterback who is 4-2 as the starter.While the 49ers also have looked dominant at times this season, they have yet to put together a winning streak. Five times this season San Francisco has won two consecutive games, and five times they have failed to win the third game, including a 24-24 tie against St. Louis in Week 10.To win the Super Bowl — or even just get there — the 49ers will have to change that.""It was a punch in the face,"" cornerback Carlos Rogers said of the loss in Seattle. ""But the thing about it is we still have a chance to win the division and we're in the playoffs. It's a new season once the playoffs start.""NOTES: The 49ers released LB Alex Hoffman-Ellis from the practice squad. He had been signed on Dec. 4.... Players are off Tuesday for Christmas.___Online: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"

Winter weather continues in Germany with more snowfall forecast and very low temperatures for the next few days.

There is a special energy to this night. This silent night is a doorway into the mystic's heart in all of us. Christmas Eve, there is an opportunity to discover the source of all the giving and receiving. If we can go beyond the rush of the season and especially the rush of our own thoughts, there is a mystery to discover that can change our lives for the holidays, perhaps into the New Year, and much longer.This mystery begins in the silence. The holiday stories are all about miraculous events that came out of a night of profound silence. We all know the stories, but do we know the silence from which the stories emerged? Finding time for silence can lead us to an inner silence where the peace and light at the source of the holidays can be with us. With all the activity, if we can find the opportunity to just be, moments of stillness can be moments of perfect food, feeding some place inside of us that only silence can nourish. Sitting with a fire late at night, the star-filled sky, or watching the sunrise, the sweetness of silence can fill our body and fulfill a part of us that is longing. Snow, wind, rain, nature in its many voices, the music of silence can open and inspire us. In the silence on Christmas Eve is a spirit of giving, unique to this night among all others. There is a stillness that shelters us. The quiet can be our own personal doorway into the mystic's heart, the heart of simple peace. And simple peace can be a path into new life that includes the sacred. The gifts of silence escape most people. We are chained to the noise, the news, and demands of normal life. Meanwhile the special peace found in silence is all around us. Silence can wash our thoughts and feelings, guiding us to the place inside of inner silence. Here is an inner home, a shelter to something beyond words and feelings. It is very beautiful to give silence all of our awareness. There is a great landscape to be found, the landscape of our heart. People who pray and meditate often have views of this inner landscape. But we can just as often be trapped in our mental worlds, occupied with all the chatter of our thoughts. Perhaps this night we can enjoy the joy of no thought, simply be, and receive what comes out of the stillness.   This night we can give ourselves the gift of embracing our hearts in silence. Taking time to enjoy silence is time for the simple beauty of life. When we are talking less, we are being more. In these moments, silence picks us up, wraps around, and holds our awareness. When our awareness is not busy, full of things to do, and seemingly endless thoughts, the heart has its own awareness. This Christmas Eve can be in simple peace and expectation. The mystic's heart is the child's heart in each of us, extremely present and available. What is life going to bring us this moment, this night?  Enjoying silence is learning to listen deeply and receive. Instead of managing all the details of the holiday, silence holds the place inside of us that is wonder, humility, giving. Silence reminds us of being more and doing less, to embrace this moment instead of hurrying to the next. The mystic's heart is a deep well of being inside of us, a well of trust, confidence, and abundance. Let's be quiet and allow our awareness to fall into the brilliant unknown of the night. What better time to receive the touch of silence and begin a new journey of heartfulness. This time of outer and inner silence transforms us. As the quiet grows within, we discover the world around us is different. Our family, friends, life is somehow more present, bright, sacred. Silence has a presence and is a gift for everyone. Sharing silence with our love ones can be sharing the true gift of the season. Maybe the gift of silence is what this year's holiday is really about. The gift of silence can restore the mystic within an unbelieving soul. Given the opportunity, the peace and stillness this Christmas Eve can restore something even more beautiful: our innocence.For more by Bruce Davis, Ph.D., click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

In an age when travelers have to toss bottled water at airport security checkpoints, what may be most striking about the arrest of a passenger from Japan wearing a bulletproof vest and flying with checked luggage loaded with a cache of weapons, shackles and body bags is that most of it wasn't illegal on the flight to the U.S. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9caa32240000300094c560.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been almost three years to the day since Special Agent Robert Flaherty knocked on my front door and handed me a subpoena.The Department of Homeland Security order -- which would have forced me to reveal the name of a source who had sent me a ""secret"" TSA security directive -- was dropped a few days later after I told the feds I'd see them in court. It also turned me from an aviation security skeptic into one of the TSA's most vocal critics. Every week I take the agency to task on my consumer advocacy site.So you'd think that when it comes to the subject of airport safety, I wouldn't have one nice thing to say. But that would be wrong.Actually, I can think of seven things about airport security that I love -- and that I think you will, too. As one of the busiest travel weeks of the year begins today, let's review them.TSA Pre-Check. Wow, I wish we could all use those lines. It's common-sense screening. No invasive scans and you can keep your shoes on. Too bad you have to either be an elite-level flier or a member of the Global Entry, SENTRI or NEXUS programs to qualify. But maybe they'll let everyone into that line soon. After all, the government collects enough pre-flight information about us to ""pre-check"" everyone on the plane, don't they?Families get a pass on scanners. Although it probably won't admit it, the TSA generally doesn't force young kids through its controversial full-body scanners, and -- bonus! -- it also won't make their parents or guardians go through. In my last eight flights, we've never come close to one of those dreaded machines. I like that.Almost no wait to be screened. The TSA is so overstaffed that it's unlikely you'll wait longer than 10 minutes to get screened. Even during the busy holidays. Yeah, that's what $8 billion the TSA cost us this year will buy you. Here are the TSA's self-reported wait numbers, if you're a trusting kind of air traveler. And you know what? This is one of the rare times when I do believe them. At least, most of the time.You can leave your shoes on. If you're under 12 or over 75, that is. But I'll take it. I have three kids under 12, and do you know how hard retrieving three pair of shoes at the end of the conveyor belt is -- plus remembering your own? Thanks, TSA.A little more common sense. Good news: they're allowing snowglobes on the plane this year. Just small ones. But it's progress. Hey TSA, how 'bout those liquids and gels?Private ""enterprise"" is alive and well. Think the TSA isn't entrepreneurial enough? Think again. It sells all those items it confiscates, replenishing the government trough from which it slurps, even if it's done somewhat indirectly. That's gotta count for something, even if technically, those items weren't theirs to sell in the first place.This is just the beginning. Agency critics are getting their act together and pressuring Congress to rein in the TSA. Already, some of the most dangerous full-body scanners have been quietly removed, and some are now collecting dust in a warehouse. Next to go are the rest of the scanners, which will either be decommissioned or reach the end of their intended life-cycle in a few years. It can't happen soon enough.Don't get too excited, because there are plenty of exceptions to the rules. Too many kids and grandmas still get hassled during screening. And if you want to experience a long delay at the screening area, just opt out of the full-body scanners. You could be left waiting, and might even miss your flight, a little trick agents call a retaliatory wait time.But overall, even though there's more than enough for which to criticize the TSA, there's a little to like. And in the future -- if we can keep the pressure on the agency -- there will be even more to love.And what if you don't? Don't worry. I'll be here to write about that."

Why don't you lower your weapon, and I'll put down mine and then we can discuss this issue like rational gun owners. ROBBER Okay.(Carefully, they lay their weapons down on the counter)  ROBBER I am glad you are beginning to show some respect for my sacred Second Amendment rights.

The holidays give us a moment to strengthen our bonds with family and show our thanks for all the blessings we normally take for granted. In the face of continued financial hardship, it's also a reminder to make the most of what we have. Instead of focusing on what we lack, let's examine ways to build upon our blessings. Below are a few important financial lessons we can learn from the holidays: The Joys of a Home-Cooked Meal: The holidays reminds us that a big home-cooked meal can turn any dinner into a special ritual. Taking the time to cook a big meal instead of going to a restaurant is cheaper, healthier and allows families to show off their creativity and skills while spending quality time together in the kitchen. Eating out daily adds up quickly. Down the road, those expenditures may leave you vulnerable and ill-prepared to deal with an unexpected cost or emergency.The Best Things in Life Are Free (or Inexpensive): The holidays also reminds us that our happiest memories don't have to be tied to expensive gifts or fancy outings. Having a good time can be as inexpensive and easy as inviting friends over for a potluck dinner, renting a movie or playing board games with family. If your entertainment spending is putting you in a financial bind, it may be time to reassess your priorities and simplify your outlook. Tying too much of your happiness to expensive brands and gadgets guarantees that you'll remain discontent no matter how much you spend. Focus on cultivating the inner resources you'll always have in abundance, like personal talents, friendship and compassion.Giving Is Its Own Reward: The holidays are a popular time for food drives and gift banks, but even during this season many of us fixate on our own have-nots because we're constantly bombarded by consumerist ads and images. Helping the less fortunate can clear our minds of these distractions and bring our core priorities and values back into focus. Enrich your life and extend the spirit of giving beyond the holidays by taking advantage of year-round volunteer opportunities at charities, animal shelters or other organizations that give back to the community. These volunteer experiences are not only good for the soul but good for the resume.Celebrate Your True Wealth: Finally, the holidays reaffirms the central importance of our relationships with loved ones. Our prosperity and well-being as individuals depend directly on the strength of our personal support network and our community at large. Without their help, none of us would be able to achieve true wealth. Rejoice in your interdependence with others, especially your family and friends -- they're the most important asset you'll ever have.Dedrick Muhammad is the senior director of the NAACP Economic Programs.

The lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of other NYSE Euronext shareholders and aims to block the sale.It is the second such lawsuit filed against the exchange operator since the deal was announced on Thursday. An individual shareholder, Samuel Cohen, filed a proposed class action in Delaware Chancery Court on Friday that also seeks to prevent the buyout from going forward.Under the deal, NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, will sell itself to Atlanta-based ICE. The stock-and-cash deal is expected to close in the second half of 2013.At $33.12 per share, ICE's offer represents a 28 percent premium to NYSE Euronext's closing price last Wednesday.In court papers, the New Jersey pension fund said the deal was based on a ""hopelessly flawed process"" that would favor NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer and several members of its board of directors.The sale was ""designed to ensure the sale of NYSE Euronext to ICE on terms preferential to ICE and designed to benefit NYSE Euronext's insiders,"" the pension fund said.A spokesman for NYSE Euronext declined to comment. A spokeswoman for ICE, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, did not return a call seeking comment.The lawsuit also names as defendants Niederauer, NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels, and other executives and board members.The buyout is expected to help ICE compete in derivatives trading against U.S.-based CME Group, owner of the Chicago Board of Trade. Derivatives trading is highly profitable for the exchanges, and new rules next year will dramatically expand the demand for clearing over-the-counter contracts.NYSE Euronext's stock market businesses are less valuable to ICE, and the company said it will try to spin off the Euronext European stock market businesses in a public offering, generating speculation it may also have little interest in the NYSE trading floor.Profits from stock trading have been significantly eroded by new technology and the rise of other places for investors to trade, including venues known as ""dark pools.""The cases are New Jersey Carpenters Pension Fund et al. v. NYSE Euronext et al., Supreme Court of the State of New York, No. 654496/2012, and Cohen v. NYSE Euronext et al, Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 8136."

Instagram backed down on December 18, 2012 from a planned policy change that appeared to clear the way for the mobile photo sharing service to sell pictures without compensation, after users cried foul.

Facebook representatives could not immediately be reached for a comment.Instagram, which allows people to add filters and effects to photos and share them easily on the Internet, was acquired by Facebook earlier this year for $715 million.In announcing revised terms of service last week, Instagram spurred suspicions that it would sell user photos without compensation. It also announced a mandatory arbitration clause, forcing users to waive their rights to participate in a class action lawsuit except under very limited circumstances.The current terms of service, in effect through mid-January, contain no such liability shield.The backlash prompted Instagram founder and CEO Kevin Systrom to retreat partially a few days later, deleting language about displaying photos without compensation.However, Instagram kept language that gave it the ability to place ads in conjunction with user content, and saying ""that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such."" It also kept the mandatory arbitration clause.The lawsuit, filed by San Diego-based law firm Finkelstein & Krinsk, says customers who do not agree with Instagram's terms can cancel their profile but then forfeit rights to photos they had previously shared on the service.""In short, Instagram declares that 'possession is nine-tenths of the law and if you don't like it, you can't stop us,'"" the lawsuit says.Kurt Opsahl, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation who had criticized Instagram, said he was pleased that the company rolled back some of the advertising terms and agreed to better explain their plans in the future.However, he said the new terms no longer contain language which had explicitly promised that private photos would remain private. Facebook had engendered criticism in the past, Opsahl said, for changing settings so that the ability to keep some information private was no longer available.""Hopefully, Instagram will learn from that experience and refrain from removing privacy settings,"" Opsahl said.The civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Lucy Funes, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated vs. Instagram Inc., 12-cv-6482.

Today, they no longer have to wonder. Children worldwide can track Santa's sleigh as it soars from country to country using only their computers.The North American Aerospace Defense Command, better known as NORAD, is keeping up with its annual holiday tradition of following the process of Santa Claus as he travels around the world delivering gifts. The military agency charged with monitoring the skies above the U.S. and Canada for the other 364 days of the year has turned its attention to Saint Nick on Dec. 24, tracking his progress with an online map updated in realtime.At www.noradsanta.org, kids (and kids at heart) can also see how many billions of gifts have been delivered thus far and which city Santa is headed for next. In addition, NORAD has set up Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google+ accounts to give the up-to-the-minute whereabouts of Kris Kringle. NORAD tracking Santa's sleigh.How did a serious and staright-laced military organization get mixed up with magical reindeer and flying sleighs? As NORAD's website explains, it all started with a typo back when the group was known as CONAD:The tradition began in 1955 after a Colorado Springs-based Sears Roebuck & Co. advertisement misprinted the telephone number for children to call Santa. Instead of reaching Santa, the phone number put kids through to the CONAD Commander-in-Chief's operations ""hotline."" The Director of Operations at the time, Colonel Harry Shoup, had his staff check the radar for indications of Santa making his way south from the North Pole. Children who called were given updates on his location, and a tradition was born.From 2007 to 2011, NORAD had teamed up with Google to help map Santa's journey. But for 2012, the agency chose to partner with rival Microsoft instead. ""NORAD is grateful for the partnership and the resulting success,"" the agency said of Google according to the blog Search Engine Land. ""This year, NTS [NORAD Tracks Santa] and Google mutually agreed to go in new directions."" The agency is using Bing Maps to power the 2D version of NORAD's Santa tracker.But Google isn't entirely on Santa's naughty list. The company has its own Santa tracker online that might outdo NORAD's. It too shows Santa's current location and where he's delivered gifts thus far, but also features a colorful Santa's Village with games and animation. Google also sports an Android app and Chrome browser extension to follow Santa. Google's rival Santa tracker.Those away from their computers can also download NORAD's Santa tracking apps for iPhone, Android and Windows Phone.
