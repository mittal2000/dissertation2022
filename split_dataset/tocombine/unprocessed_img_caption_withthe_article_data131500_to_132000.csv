We've rounded up nine foods that you really need to cook before eating.Click Here to see The Complete List of Foods You Should Never Eat RawThe earliest humans had a specialized organ whose chief purpose was to help digest cellulose (among other things): the appendix. Now that it's vestigial, certain foods that are very high in cellulose, like kale spines, need to be removed and aren't edible at all. But there are a host of reasons why some foods need to be cooked before eating, and the fact that they can't be digested is just one of them. The most obvious food that needs to be cooked is meat. Aside from it being difficult for our stomachs to process a big slab of raw meat, it can also be full of parasites and bacteria that can kill, like salmonella. Other foods contain poisons that need to be cooked off. Also, don't forget that these foods tend to taste pretty bad.Some of these foods might surprise you: yucca, also known as cassava, doesn't just taste bad raw; it can also send you to the hospital if eaten uncooked. Others, like chicken, aren't that surprising at all, but still good to know about. So read on to learn about nine foods that you shouldn't eat raw, and why. -Dan Myers, The Daily MealMore Content from The Daily Meal:The Unhealthiest Foods in the Food Court101 Best Pizzas in AmericaHow to Choose an Avocado"
1,FOOD & DRINK,Beef Stroganoff Is Named for Who Exactly?,"Bon Appetit, Contributor
Bon Appetit",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beef-stroganoff-is-named_us_5b9dcbc0e4b03a1dcc8cfc4f,"This winter, we're fighting back the cold with an old-timey classic, and we mean REALLY old-timey: beef stroganoff.",2014-01-17,2014-01-17-Portrait_of_Count_Pavel_Stroganoff_17721817.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-17-Portrait_of_Count_Pavel_Stroganoff_17721817-thumb.jpg,"Mike LewThis winter, we're fighting back the cold with an old-timey classic, and we mean REALLY old-timey: beef stroganoff. This dish was invented sometime in the early 1800s and had its American heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, but since then has fallen out of favor (and flavor). We, however, aren't quite ready to send beef stroganoff off to pasture, because this dish can be so much more than the standard recipe of ground beef, onions, and cream of mushroom soup. For instance we've got one version that calls for tri-tip, Hungarian sweet paprika, and chanterelles. Another version calls for tenderloin, Cognac, and whipping cream.But who was Stroganoff, exactly? A saint? A playboy? A tyrant?As it turns out, the dish's namesake -- Count Pavel Aleksandrovich Stroganoff -- was kind of a hunk.According to the Stroganoff Foundation, which is dedicated to ""preserving the artistic legacy left to Russia by the Stroganoff family,"" the origins of the Stroganoff clan date back to just before the reign of Ivan the Terrible. In the 1300s, the family swelled its fortunes through trade, land acquisition, and salt mining. Then, as Ivan the Terrible sealed his control over Moscow and all its surrounding states, the Stroganoff family matriarch (Anika Feodorovitch, 1488-1570) made a daring gambit by seizing much of Siberia and allying herself with Ivan, ceding her territory to him in exchange for a long-term land grant. Effectively, this made the Stroganoff family the de facto manager of all of Siberia.Flash-forward to the 17th century and the Stroganoffs were still closely aligned with the czarist government, and much wealthier for it. The family was now part of a Europe-hopping Russian aristocracy, which is why Count Pavel Stroganoff (1774-1817) was actually born in Paris. The son of Count Alexander Sergeyevich Stroganoff and Princess Ekaterina Troubetzkaya, Pavel is largely a footnote to Russian history. Despite being pretty low-key (as low-key as a ridiculously wealthy member of the Russian elite can be), he did serve as a diplomat to Britain and a general in the Napoleonic Wars (for which he earned the St. George Cross, one of Russia's highest military honors).SEE MORE:Ingredients We Can't Cook Without Count Stroganoff's French/Russian split found its way into his diet, as Russian aristocrats would often hire French cooks but retain a palate honed in the homeland. According to the cookbook A Taste of Russia, the original beef Stroganoff recipe derived from a basic French mustard for seasoning beef, combined with a dollop of Russian sour cream, which Stroganoff's chef named after his benefactor.The count himself died of tuberculosis at the age of 43, somewhere near Copenhagen. His clan lived on in luxury well into the 19th century, and today they are survived by a vast art collection as well as a grand estate in St. Petersburg known as the Stroganoff Palace.You can even visit the Stroganoff Palace if you so choose. It was nationalized in 1917 and became a part of the state's Russian Museum in 1990. Just don't arrive looking for any ""authentic family recipe tips"" from real Stroganoff family members. The last heiress to the Stroganoff dynasty, Countess Olga, died in 1837.See more from Bon Appetit: 10 Snacks You Thought Were Healthy But Really Aren't 25 Ways to Use Sriracha 8 Foods That Could Kill You 21 Recipes for Dutch Ovens"

The H7N9 bird",2014-01-17,"This undated handout image provided by Science and the University of Tokyo shows infectious particles of the avian H7N9 virus emerging from a cell. Scientists who sparked an outcry by creating easier-to-spread versions of the bird flu want to try such experiments again using a worrisome new strain. Since it broke out in China in March, the H7N9 bird flu has infected more than 130 people and killed 43. Leading flu researchers say that genetically engineering this virus in the lab could help track whether it?s changing in the wild to become a bigger threat. They announced the pending plans Wednesday in letters to the journals Science and Nature. (AP Photo/Takeshi Noda/University of Tokyo, Science)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dcb2525000033003698da.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate Kelland, Health and Science CorrespondentLONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - A wave of H7N9 bird flu cases and deaths in China since the start of 2014 shows emerging flu strains need constant surveillance if the world is not to be caught off guard by a deadly pandemic.At least 24 H7N9 flu infections and three deaths have been confirmed in the past week by the World Health Organisation (WHO), a big increase on the two cases and one death reported for the four-month period of June to September.China's National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Friday it had seen 28 confirmed human cases of H7N9 in five provinces across the country since the start of the year.""There's now a clear second wave of this virus,"" said Jake Dunning, a researcher at Imperial College London who has been monitoring the outbreak.While the winter flu season means an increase in infections is not unexpected, it raises the risk of the virus mutating and perhaps getting a chance to acquire genetic changes that may allow it to spread easily from one person to another.The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 170 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing around 50 of them.Many, but not all, of those infected had contact with poultry or other birds, so for now this virus has apparently not adapted to easy human-to-human transmission - one of the main features keeping a pandemic emergency response on hold.China's health commission said experts had concluded that H7N9 transmission ""is still from poultry to humans"".Yet the strain does have some worrying features, including a limited capability to spread from one person to another. CLUSTERSSeveral clusters of cases in people who had close contact with an infected person have been reported in China. An analysis of probable H7N9 transmission from person to person, published last August, gave the best proof yet that it can sporadically jump between people.A separate team of researchers in the United States said in December while it is not impossible that H7N9 could become easily transmissible from person to person, it would need to undergo multiple mutations.Another alarm was sounded last month when scientists said they had found that a mutation in the virus can render it resistant to a first-line treatment drug without limiting its ability to spread in mammals.WHO chief spokesman Gregory Hartl said the United Nations health agency had noted the rapid increase in infections in the past few weeks and was keeping a watchful eye.""So far we haven't seen anything that causes us to change our risk assessment,"" he said from WHO's Geneva headquartersThe WHO's stance, based on its Dec. 20 assessment, is that five small family clusters have been reported but ""evidence does not currently support sustained human-to-human transmission of this virus. The current likelihood of community-level spread ... is considered to be low.""That was echoed by the Chinese health commission, which said: ""Up to now, inspections have found no mutations of the virus that are of significance to public health"". MIX AND MINGLEFlu viruses, however, often put on their biggest show of strength in the northern hemisphere's cold winter months of January and February.And with more of the virus circulating in wild birds, poultry and in the larger numbers of people infected, the new strain has more opportunity to adapt and mix with other strains that may give it pandemic potential.Peter Openshaw, director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, said the rising toll of infections and deaths is ""a signal for concern"" because ""historically what has happened in major outbreaks is there are occasional, sporadic cases and then it starts to build"".""But whether it means that there is any change in the virus' behaviour is another important question. If it were changing the way it is behaving, that would be more alarming,"" he said.Early gene analysis work on the emerging H7N9 virus in April last year found it had been circulating widely but went undetected and had acquired significant genetic diversity.Scientists warned then that its genetic diversity showed the H7N9 virus has an ability to mutate repeatedly and was likely to continue doing so.Hartl said: ""Mutations happen all the time. While yes, the more virus there is, the more mutations could happen, it is also true that almost all of these mutations are benign.""

It's not about being negative; it's about being honest. And helping others to know what's coming their way so that they can be prepared. Some things though, you simply can't anticipate. For my husband and me, the unimaginable was a completely inconsolable baby for the first two months of his life. He cried constantly, screamed every time he went to the bathroom and, starting at about six weeks, regularly had blood in his diaper.The doctors -- and we went to many -- all said that nothing was wrong. Lucas had colic; Lucas's digestive system was developing and straightening out. Lucas was ""learning how to poop.""That all may have been true. But we also knew -- we just knew -- that there was more to the story. So we kept asking questions, which were increasingly met with irritation and odd looks. We came to expect eye rolls and even laughter. One pediatric gastrointestinal specialist went so far as to say -- and I'm not making this up -- that he would put a ball gag in my mouth the next time I came in. Fortunately, we were undeterred. We knew something was wrong with our little one beyond ""colic"" and we were determined to figure out what it was. Thanks to some wonderful mothers in our community, we learned that diet could be an issue beyond the dairy, wheat and soy I'd already given up in an effort to help Lucas. Yet how to determine the culprit? Desperate for answers, and devastated by our son's pain, one night my husband and I decided to go for it; to strip down to bare bones and see if we couldn't get to the bottom of things ourselves... and quickly. Starting the next day, I ate nothing but chicken, rice, apples and bananas. That's it. No spices, no cheating. And I did that for two months. At the end of the first day, Lucas's crying and screaming started to subside. By day two, the blood was out of his diaper. By day three, he was a totally different child... happy, laughing and alert. And he's been that way ever since. Thankfully, I've been able to reintegrate many foods in the last couple of weeks, not including chocolate, dairy, and very unfortunately, coffee (which I fantasize about on a regular basis...). Tough as the caffeine and sleep deprivation may be, I wouldn't trade the experience. Or more importantly, what I've learned from it: 1. Trust your instincts. Obviously, it's important to keep an open mind and to remember that as new moms, our emotions can prevent us from seeing things entirely objectively. That said, a mother's intuition is no joke. Listen when it speaks. 2. Take action. Be bold in your choices and brave in carrying them out. As with everything that truly matters to you, don't do them halfway. Some things are worth fighting for, no matter what other people might say or think. Your child is certainly one of them. 3. Be positive. Be willing to learn from your experiences rather that resentful of them. Thanksgiving could have been real bummer, but I was determined to be lighthearted about it. By then I'd been able to add avocado and sweet potato back into my diet, so my plate -- while perhaps not quite as tasty as everyone else's -- was certainly as colorful!4. Keep your eyes on the prize. That's not to say it's been easy (I said be positive, not delusional!). I broke down in tears when my family's Chinese takeout arrived a few weeks ago. And watching other people eat cheese never fails to make my mouth water in embarrassing ways. Yet when the going gets particularly tough -- as it often did in the beginning -- I remember who I am doing this for... who I am fighting for, and why. That reminder not only gets me through every time, it has made me able to keep a smile on my face throughout (most of) the process. At almost five months, we're still getting up twice a night, and my fantasies about coffee are starting to border on the obscene. That said, we also have the most happy and healthy little boy in the world. For that... for him... I would gladly do it all over again.

Of course, there are other wonderful spices in there, too.

Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot and slow-simmer for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pot stand covered for another 30 minutes to let the spices infuse. Strain the mixture through a fine-meshed sieve. Discard the spices and return the strained cider to the stove. Re-heat over medium heat until very warm, but not boiling. Turn off the heat, add the lemon juice and Scotch and stir well. Using tall, narrow glasses, tuck an apple slice inside each glass. Top with the warm mulled cider and serve.Viviane's TipA single chipotle pepper is a tiny bundle of heat! If you want a hint of spice, keep the chipotle pepper whole (as called for in the recipe). But if you want a spicy cocktail, then cut the chipotle in 2 or 3 pieces. The seeds will impart their fieriness to the cider and make for a drink brimming with smoke and heat.* * *Now, how about this Bourbon Sidecar with lemon bitters?"
