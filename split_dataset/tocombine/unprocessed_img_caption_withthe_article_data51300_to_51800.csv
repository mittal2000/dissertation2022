An official said 161 of them were mostly civilians and police officers, while the remaining 104 were coup supporters.But the coup attempt crumbled as Erdogan rushed back to Istanbul from a Mediterranean holiday and urged people to take to the streets to support his government against plotters he accused of trying to kill him.“They will pay a heavy price for this,” said Erdogan, launching a purge of the armed forces, which last used force to stage a successful coup more than 30 years ago. “This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army.”Among those detained were top military commanders, including the head of the Second Army which protects the country’s borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran, state-run Anadolu news agency said.Hundreds of soldiers were held in Ankara for alleged involvement in the coup, leaving police stations overflowing.Some had to be taken under armed police escort in buses to a sports stadium. Reuters footage showed some of the detainees, handcuffed and stripped from the waist up, sitting on the floor of one of the buses.The government declared the situation under control, saying 2,839 people had been rounded up, from foot soldiers to senior officers, including those who formed “the backbone” of the rebellion.Authorities also began a major crackdown in the judiciary over suspected links to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, removing from their posts and ordering the detention of nearly 3,000 prosecutors and judges, including from top courts.Erdogan has blamed the coup on supporters of Gulen, who he has frequently accused of trying to foment uprising in the military, media and judiciary.Ten members of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors and two members of the Constitutional Court have already been detained, officials said.OBAMA’S SUPPORTA successful overthrow of Erdogan, who has ruled the country of about 80 million people since 2003, would have marked another seismic shift in the Middle East, five years after the Arab uprisings erupted and plunged Turkey’s southern neighbor Syria into civil war.However, a failed coup attempt could still destabilize the NATO member and major U.S. ally that lies between the European Union and the chaos of Syria, with Islamic State bombers targeting Turkish cities and the government also at war with Kurdish separatists.U.S. President Barack Obama expressed support for Turkey’s government and urged parties on all sides of the crisis to avoid destabilizing the country and follow the rule of law. But his secretary of state, John Kerry, warned Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu that public suggestions of a U.S. role in the plot were “utterly false” and harmful to relations.Erdogan, who had been holidaying on the southwest coast when the coup was launched, flew into Istanbul before dawn on Saturday and told thousands of flag-waving supporters at the airport that the government remained at the helm.A polarizing figure whose Islamist-rooted ideology lies at odds with supporters of modern Turkey’s secular principles, Erdogan said the plotters had tried to attack him in the resort town of Marmaris.“They bombed places I had departed from right after I was gone,” he said. “They probably thought we were still there.”Erdogan’s AK Party has long had strained relations with the military, which has a history of mounting coups to defend secularism although it has not seized power directly since 1980.His conservative religious vision for Turkey’s future has also alienated many ordinary citizens who accuse him of authoritarianism.

The cleric, who once supported Erdogan but became a leading adversary, condemned the attempted coup and said he played no role in it.SOLDIERS SURRENDERGunfire and explosions had rocked both Istanbul and Ankara through the night after soldiers took up positions in both cities and ordered state television to read out a statement declaring they had taken power. However, by dawn the noise of fighting had died down considerably.About 50 soldiers involved in the coup surrendered on one of the bridges across the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul after dawn on Saturday, abandoning their tanks with their hands raised in the air. Reuters witnesses saw government supporters attack the pro-coup soldiers who had surrendered.By Saturday afternoon, CNN Turk reported that security forces had completed an operation against coup plotters at the headquarters of the military general staff. Security sources also said police detained about 100 military officers at an air base in the southeast.Neighboring Greece arrested eight men aboard a Turkish military helicopter which landed in the northern city of Alexandroupolis on Saturday, the Greek police ministry said, adding that they had requested political asylum.At one stage military commanders were held hostage by the plotters and by Saturday evening ― 24 hours after the coup was launched ― some operations against rebels were continuing.Cavusoglu, the foreign minister, said soldiers at the Incirlik air base, used by the United States to launch air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria, were involved in the attempt. He said Turkey would resume operations with the U.S.-led coalition once the anti-coup operations were completed.LAWMAKERS IN HIDINGThe coup began with warplanes and helicopters roaring over Ankara and troops moving in to seal off the bridges over the Bosphorus, which separates Europe and Asia in Istanbul.Turkish maritime authorities reopened the Bosphorus to transiting tankers after shutting the major trade route from the Black Sea to the Aegean for several hours for security and safety reasons.In the early hours of Saturday, lawmakers hid in shelters inside the parliament building, which was fired on by tanks. An opposition deputy told Reuters that parliament was hit three times and people had been wounded.When parliament convened later in the day, the four main political parties - running the gamut from Erdogan’s right-wing Islamist-rooted AK Party to the left-of-center, pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) - came together in a rare show of unity to condemn the attempted coup.A Turkish military commander also said fighter jets had shot down a helicopter used by the coup plotters over Ankara.Momentum turned against the coup plotters as the night wore on. Crowds defied orders to stay indoors, gathering at major squares in Istanbul and Ankara, waving flags and chanting.“We have a prime minister, we have a chief of command, we’re not going to leave this country to degenerates,” shouted one man, as groups of government supporters climbed onto a tank near Ataturk airport.Kerry said he had phoned the Turkish foreign minister and underlined “absolute support for Turkey’s democratically elected, civilian government and democratic institutions”.FLIGHTS RESUMEFlag carrier Turkish Airlines resumed flights on Saturday, though some foreign carriers canceled weekend flights.At the height of the action, rebel soldiers took control of TRT state television, which announced a countrywide curfew and martial law.

But the coup attempt crumbled as Erdogan rushed back to Istanbul from a Mediterranean holiday and urged people to take to the streets in support of his government against plotters he accused of trying to kill him.The violence shocked the nation of almost 80 million, once seen as a model Muslim democracy, where living standards have grown steadily for more than a decade and where the army last used force to stage a successful coup more than 30 years ago.It also shattered fragile confidence among Turkey’s allies about security in the NATO member country, a leading member of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State which aspires to membership of the European Union. Turkey had already been hit by repeated suicide bombings over the past year and is struggling to contain an insurgency by Kurdish separatists.U.S. President Barack Obama urged parties on all sides of the crisis to avoid destabilizing Turkey and follow the rule of law. U.S. authorities banned all airlines from flying from Turkey to the United States, citing continued security concerns, and urged U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to Turkey.French President Francois Hollande said on Saturday he expected there would be a period of repression in Turkey in the aftermath of the failed coup.“They will pay a heavy price for this,” Erdogan said, launching a purge of the armed forces. “This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army.”He told crowds chanting for a return of the death penalty, which has been abolished, that parliament may consider such a proposal.Hundreds of soldiers were held in Ankara for alleged involvement, leaving police stations overflowing. Among those detained was the head of the Second Army which protects the country’s borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran, state-run Anadolu news agency said.Some had to be taken under armed police escort in buses to a sports stadium.

He said the attempted overthrow may have been staged to justify a crackdown.”As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations,” Gulen said in a statement.Erdogan called on the United States to extradite Gulen. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington was willing to help Turkey as it tries to identify those involved, but made clear it would act only if there was evidence against Gulen.Kerry also warned that public suggestions of a U.S. role were “utterly false” and harmful to relations after Turkey’s labor minister suggested there had been U.S. involvement in the plot.Erdogan, who had been holidaying on the southwest coast when the coup attempt was launched, flew into Istanbul before dawn on Saturday and told thousands of flag-waving supporters at the airport that the government remained at the helm.A polarizing figure whose Islamist-rooted ideology lies at odds with supporters of modern Turkey’s secular principles, Erdogan said the plotters had tried to attack him in the resort town of Marmaris.His AK Party has long had strained relations with the military, which has a history of mounting coups to defend secularism although it has not seized power directly since 1980.His conservative religious vision for Turkey’s future has also alienated many ordinary citizens who accuse him of authoritarianism.

5,WOMEN,Why Women's Magazines Should Unite: The 51 Million,"Brooke Hauser, ContributorMagazine writer, author of Enter Helen: The Invention of Helen...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-womens-magazines-should-unite-the-51-million_us_5789316ae4b0e7c8734ffddf,It’s time to make some noise. The stakes are too high to stay silent.,2016-07-17,Helen Gurley Brown leading a <em>Cosmopolitan</em> editorial meeting in the 1960s.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57894b5319000016008a6809.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the early 1970s, Gloria Steinem and her colleagues at Ms. magazine had a nickname for Cosmopolitan, then edited by Helen Gurley Brown. They called it “the unliberated woman’s survival kit,” an apt description for a magazine that featured cover lines like “Why I Wear My False Eyelashes to Bed” and “How Not to Get Dumped on His Way Up.” Despite being one of Brown’s most outspoken critics, Steinem also saw the advantage of uniting with her to spread the message of women’s liberation to Cosmo’s readers, many of them conservative, small-town girls who might not otherwise get the memo.“We each serve a different purpose with our publications,” Steinem wrote in a letter to Brown. “Ms. has a complementary function as a kind of early warning system on emerging issues that is helpful to other women’s magazines, and vice versa.”In other words, the concept of sisterhood could, and should, extend to women’s magazines.For a brief period in 1976, it did. That year, 32 of the nation’s top magazines for women and girls joined forces to help get the word out about the Equal Rights Amendment (the ERA), which had been ratified by 34 states and needed four more to become law. In addition to Cosmopolitan and Ms., American Girl, Daytime TV, Essence, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies’ Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall’s, Modern Bride, Seventeen, Vogue, and Woman’s Day were some of the other names on the list.Together, the participating magazines reached 60 million readers; if mobilized, those readers could help change the very fabric of American life. The editors committed to a plan: Each magazine would simultaneously publish an article on the ERA in their July 1976 issues, which would hit stands that June. “While each magazine will approach the subject matter in its own way,” the editors wrote in a statement to the press, “we are unanimous in our opinion that discussion is of primary importance.” The ERA failed to achieve ratification. Now, 40 years later, we are facing the possible election of a dangerous presidential candidate: Donald Trump, who could do more damage to the long fight for women’s equality than any other candidate in recent memory ― a candidate who believes that women who have abortions should get “some form of punishment.”Even more ominous than his stance on reproductive rights is the meanness and misogyny built into his brand; he has called women “fat pigs,” “dogs,” and “disgusting animals” in an attempt to mute their voices.Trump, of course, is an equal opportunity offender, attacking freedom of speech across the board. After his ban of Washington Post journalists, columnist Dana Milbank called for a media blackout of Trump. And recently, the Mexican and Latin American edition of Marie Claire unveiled its July issue, featuring a collage portrait of Ivanka Trump on the cover, along with a bold appeal to his influential daughter, in Spanish: “Dear Ivanka: How long will you defend your father?” Inside the issue are emotional pleas to Ivanka written by Latin American scholars, artists, and journalists, including the magazine’s editor-in-chief, Daniela Von Wobeser, who asks her, “Do you think your father would be the leader America deserves?”If anything, it’s a good publicity stunt—Marie Claire en español has been getting a lot of attention. Still, it is not enough to mute Trump or to publish anti-Trump letters. Media outlets should do more to amplify Hillary Clinton’s message. Women’s magazines, in particular, need to speak up. Editor Jann Wenner endorsed Clinton with Rolling Stone, and Lenny Letter co-creator Lena Dunham did it in Time, saying plainly: “I want Hillary Clinton to be President.”Mainstream women’s magazines should be just as direct in expressing support for their candidate of choice. Yes, any political endorsement would alienate some advertisers and anger some readers, but it would attract others. At the very least, editors should inform their readers about what Clinton stands for when it comes to issues such as abortion, equal pay and paid family leave—as Cosmopolitan.com did this past spring with an overview of her platform.Despite all the turmoil in the publishing industry and recently shuttered print titles like Lucky and More (Ladies’ Home Journal is now on newsstands as a quarterly), women’s magazines still have the power to reach tens of millions of readers — including young single women, a potent political force — and they should harness that power for good.Some women’s magazines already have, becoming more political as the elections approach. Ever since Helen Gurley Brown’s day, Cosmopolitan has been telling women how to obtain safe abortions and equal pay.

6,ENTERTAINMENT,How Eric Stonestreet Almost Missed Out On Voicing Duke The Dog For 'The Secret Life of Pets',"Jim Hill, ContributorEntertainment journalist and Walt Disney Company expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-eric-stonestreet-almost-missed-out-on-voicing-duke_us_578c0a4ee4b0cbf01ea022c5,"So what was the most challenging aspect of working on this new Universal Pictures release? To hear Stonestreet talk, it was",2016-07-17,"(L to R) Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet on ABC's ""Modern Family."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578c0ac11900001c008a6af3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Given that Eric Stonestreet has spent the past seven years working on “Modern Family,” this two-time Emmy Award-winner thought he knew how things worked in Hollywood.“Your manager will periodically send you out to do a meet-n-greet with someone. This is one of those go-through-the-motions business things where first the person you’re meeting with tells you about the project they’re developing and then you tell them what your career aspirations are,” Stonestreet explained during a recent phone interview. “After that, you say ‘Well, it was nice to meet you.’ And they say in response that ‘It was nice meeting you as well.’ And then you go your way and they go theirs. And rarely does any real work ever come out of a meeting like that.”Well, a few years back, Eric thought that he was supposed to be having a meet-n-greet with Chris Meledandri. Who’s the founder and CEO of Illumination Entertainment, the animation studio behind such top-grossing Universal Pictures’ releases as “Despicable Me” and “Minions.”“So Chris is pitching me the story of ‘The Secret Life of Pets.’ And I’m sitting there thinking ‘Wow, this is going to be a big, giant hit because everyone loves their pets.’ And then Chris walks me around Illumination and shows me some of the concept art that they’ve created for this project,” Stonestreet continues. “And then I’m out in the lobby with him. And I’m shaking Chris’ hand and telling him that I wish him the best of luck with this project. And as I turn to go out the door to my car, Chris says ‘What do you think?’ Which confuses me, because I had just told him that I thought ‘The Secret Life of Pets’ was a great idea for a movie. So I start to repeat myself. And Chris then interrupts me, saying ‘No. I was wondering if you wanted to do this movie with us or not,’” Eric said.“And I was then like ‘Oh! Are you offering me this? Because – if so – my answer is yes! Absolutely yes!’ I think I actually used a cuss word at that time,” Stonestreet laughed. “I told Chris that I’d get in the car right now and call my manager and then say whatever Illumination wants, my answer is ‘Yes!’ I then apologized again to Chris because I just wasn’t used to going out for a meet-n-greet and then having an actual job offer come out of that meeting.”Though Eric wasn’t entirely up-to-speed on how animated features recruit their voice talent, thanks to the voicework that he’d already done on “Sofia the First” & “American Dad,” Stonestreet knew his way around a recording booth. “Though – that being said – recording a voice for an animated feature is a far more involved process than working on an animated television series is,” Eric explained. “On an animated television series, you pretty much read the script as written. Whereas on an animated feature, you’ll sometimes record the same scene multiple times over the course of a year as the filmmakers continue to tweak that part of the movie. Or they may have you re-record something that your character says because of something that one of the other voice actors came up with while they were in the recording booth.”But the upside of this lengthy production process was that Stonestreet then got to collaborate with the folks at Illumination when it came to deciding what his character Duke looked & sounded like.“I think one of the main reason that Chris hired me for ‘The Secret Life of Pets’ was my background in improv. Which meant that I was always open with the idea of playing around with this character, trying different things whenever I was in the recording booth,” Eric continued. “Mind you, this doesn’t mean that I’d totally disregard what the scriptwriter had written. There were words and things that I would sometime switch around. But I always followed the director’s lead and stayed true to the intent of the material. More to the point, I was perfectly comfortable with the fact that 99% of the stuff that I recorded in that booth was never going to see the light of day. My job was to give ‘The Secret Life of Pets’ production team lots of options when it came to Duke. So that’s what I always tried to do.”So what was the most challenging aspect of working on this new Universal Pictures release? To hear Stonestreet talk, it was “The Secret Life of Pets” more emotional moments. Like when Duke & Max (SPOILERS AHEAD) make their way to Duke’s first home. Only to discover that the old man who had previously owned Duke had since passed away.“That scene was definitely a challenge. Not just because – as an actor working on an animated film – you’re only got your voice to use as you’re trying to express this deeply felt emotion. But also because on an animated feature like ‘Secret Life,’ which is such a fast-paced raucous ride, you don’t really want to spend too much screen time dwelling on personal heart ache & heartbreak,” Eric said. “So that was one of those moments in the recording booth, where – after my first pass at voicing how I thought Duke might sound at this point in the story – Chris Renaud (i.e., the director of ‘The Secret Life of Pets’) said to me ‘That was really great. But on the next take, could you please speed it up a little?’ “In the end, Stonestreet’s initial hunch about this Illumination Entertainment production proved to be correct. “The Secret Life of Pets” was a smash hit when it initially bow-wowed in theaters last weekend, taking in over $104 million domestically. And this past weekend, this Chris Renaud film wound up besting Sony’s highly anticipated “Ghostbusters” reboot, pulling in an estimated additional $50.6 million at the North American box office.So what’s next for Eric? Before he starts back to work on the eighth season of “Modern Family” next month, Stonestreet hopes that he’ll be able to take the kids of a few family friends along to a matinee of “The Secret Life of Pets.”“I can imagine them looking up at the screen and then looking over at me and then looking back up at the screen, recognizing my voice and then looking back at me,” Eric concluded. “But then again, kids are funny. I’ve had friends try to explain to their kids that Uncle Eric is Duke. And they’re just like ‘Uncle Eric is not a dog. Eric is Eric.’ “"
7,POLITICS,What Actually Happens When You 'Throw A Little Gas',"Kimmery Martin, ContributorPhysician, Author, Book Reviewer at kimmerymartin.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-actually-happens-when-you-throw-a-little-gas_us_578969b4e4b0b107a2410149,Having a president afflicted with mental diarrhea is not okay.,2016-07-17,"Diorama of Omer Khawar, a victim of the Halabja chemical attack, cradling a child",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578bdcff19000017008a6ab9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I want to describe what it feels like to suffocate.First, let me acknowledge the obvious. I am writing this piece, so I am clearly still alive. I’ve never been the victim of a near-suffocation, either. I can barely even stand to hold my breath for more than thirty seconds. So why am I writing this?I’ll get to that in a moment. Bear with me, and imagine you are a young woman―let’s say 30 years old―with four children: Jacob, Caroline, Jackson, and the baby, Ellie. It’s a beautiful spring day, and you watch in amazement as out of the clear blue sky a rain of strange metallic objects begins to fall. They hit the ground and a smoke unlike anything you’ve ever seen fills the air. In your neighborhood, people are screaming, running past your house, urging you to flee. You try, but you cannot carry all four children, so you sink to the ground and do the only thing you can: you wrap your arms around them to try to shield them.The first one to die is the baby. Ellie is too young to talk, but desperation is written on her little face as she tries to breathe. Each gasp sucks more poison into her lungs; she kicks frantically, her eyes begging you for help. Her skin turns blue and a green fluid begins to seep from her mouth, but still she is conscious, still she rails against dying. There is nothing you can do except hold her until she stops struggling.In the horror of Ellie’s death, you’ve missed what’s happening to your other children. They are all three on the ground. Jackson is seizing—he must be unconscious—but the older two are awake and the agony on their faces is terrible beyond anything you can endure. Caroline’s skin is covered in bubbles—no, they are blisters—and a raspy croaking sound is coming from her mouth. She’s trying to scream. An unidentifiable scent is everywhere—it’s like apples, or garlic, or maybe rotten eggs. Your throat and eyes begin to burn. Jacob, your three year-old, is clutching his eyes. Caroline stops reaching for you and grabs her throat. There is no air left in her lungs, but her eyes are still open; she is still moving even though it looks like her face is going to explode. She and Jackson die at the same time.Now it is just you and Jacob. Each breathe you take is like inhaling fire. The pain is so intense you lose sight of your remaining child, but in your last glimpse of him you realize he’s been blinded: he’s wailing, with his hands held straight out in front him, trying to feel you. Your last coherent thought is enough to kill you: you worry he will survive. And then the pressure in your chest becomes more than you can stand, and you die.Change the names of the children to Ariya and Liyan and Adar and Rojan, and change the place to Halabja, Kurdistan, and this story is no longer so fictional. In March 1988, 5000 Kurdish civilians were massacred here—reportedly by a mixture of sarin and mustard gas and possibly cyanide—under the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. Why bring this up? Because a few days ago, I read news reports quoting Donald Trump on the subject of genocide.“Then Saddam Hussein throws a little gas, everyone goes crazy, ‘Oh he’s using gas!’” Trump said at a rally last year in which he criticized the invasion of Iraq and praised Hussein―himself a terrorist―because he killed other terrorists. To be sure Trump actually said something so asinine, I watched footage of his rally (fast forward to 1 hour, 8 minutes to hear the exact quote.)Let’s repeat Trump’s words, keeping in mind the context. Saddam Hussein “threw a little gas.”Being even momentarily cavalier about using chemical weapons on innocent people is monstrous. It should disqualify you from being a human being, let alone being the most influential human being on the planet. But Trump seems to respect some of the world’s most reprehensible villains, going out of his way to compliment Moammar Gadhafi and Kim Jong Un even as he acknowledges they’re bad guys. It’s baffling to Republican commentators ― even Rush Limbaugh described Trump as “emotionally incontinent.” Personally, I would prefer the leader of the free world to be continent. A bonus would be getting through a speech without a torrent of straight-up insanity. Do I think Donald Trump is in favor of gassing babies? No. (Except maybe terrorists’ babies—he’s already said he’d “take out” their families.) Do I think it matters what you say, especially if you’re aiming to be POTUS? Yes. After Trump’s comments on “taking out” the families of terrorists, a predictable outcry arouse, in which it was pointed out that intentionally ordering the military to murder civilians is a war crime. Trump’s response: “They won’t refuse. They’re not gonna refuse me. Believe me,” adding: “I’ve always been a leader… If I say do it, they’re going to do it.” Then, in practically the next breath, he insisted he never said he’d kill the families of terrorists. My point is not that it’s wrong to kill people related to terrorists, or that the Middle East is any more or less stable with dictators in charge. My point is that Trump appears unable to appreciate the consequences of words. Having a president afflicted with mental diarrhea is not okay. If you vote for Trump, you are voting for someone who is incapable of controlling himself, assuming he’s not actually stone evil. I’m not endorsing anyone in this election, and no one would care if I did. I am a regular person. I’m a doctor, and I’m a wife and mother. I swing both ways, politically-speaking, and I have friends all across the spectrum of beliefs. (And I hope these friends will visit me in the internment camps if Trump gets elected.)But I don’t think I can stay silent when I think of a presidential candidate describing what Saddam Hussein did as “throwing a little gas.” "
8,EDUCATION,Should Schools Ban Cellphones?,"Alexandre Silberman, ContributorA 19-year-old multimedia journalist and travel enthusiast with...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-schools-ban-cellphones_us_578affe7e4b0cbf01ea0035d,"Mr. MacNeil has taken steps in the past to prevent use, including the purchase of a cell phone jammer.",2016-07-17,"Burlington (Vt.) High School Social Studies teacher Ron MacNeil is one of many staff who are frustrated with cellphone use in class. Mr. MacNeil is pictured holding a cellphone jammer, a device that blocks cell service.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578b00ac130000150005e4da.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ron MacNeil is in total support of a complete cellphone ban.It turns out he is not the only one.Mr. MacNeil, a social studies teacher at Burlington High School in Burlington, Vt., has been dealing with the distraction of cellphones for around ten years. He believes about half of his students are on their phones in class at a given time.His current policy is just to ask students to put them away. Mr. MacNeil said he has not been strict when it comes to enforcement.“I’ve always argued that if a kid has a cellphone in class, you take it, and a parent has to come get it,” he said, although Mr. MacNeil has yet to use this policy.He recalled a time when the high school had a complete cellphone ban, and use was prohibited anywhere on campus.“[Cellphones] weren’t allowed, and then they just kept liberalizing the rules,” Mr. MacNeil explained.As a psychology teacher, Mr. MacNeil is well-informed of the neurological effects of cellphone use. He thinks using them is addictive and compulsive behavior.“This generation is addicted to instant gratification, instant information and instant contact,” he said.“I think the constant need to be connected to something outside of the space that you’re actually occupying is a detriment to your capacity to learn.” Mr. MacNeil then went on to explain how cellphone use overstimulates the brain.He remembered being present at a meeting with an assistant principal, another teacher, a student and his parents. The student had his phone underneath his t-shirt and was texting through the surface of the shirt. While Mr. MacNeil laughed at the situation, it made him well aware of how addictive cellphones can be.Mr. MacNeil thinks the possibility of the school’s administration creating a total cellphone ban is highly unlikely, yet he said many of his colleagues are in favor. At the time of his interview, one of his fellow teachers stepped inside the room to voice his support.“I know that sounds extreme, but a lot of universities have enacted similar policies,” Mr. MacNeil said of the cellphone ban.Mr. MacNeil has taken steps in the past to prevent use, including the purchase of a cell phone jammer, a device that cuts out service. The device is considered illegal, yet no one has been prosecuted in the United States for having one, he said.Mr. MacNeil added that at the time he purchased the jammer, he talked to the teachers in neighboring classrooms about it, who were in full support.The jammer is less effective at this point because it has become outdated. It only blocks up to 3G signal, and students with smartphones can still use WiFi.Beth Fialko Casey, an English teacher, also feels concerned about cellphone use, but is not in favor of the cellphone ban.“I feel like as a teacher we need to be the enforcers of that,” she said.Nonetheless, she did voice her concern for the distraction cellphones are creating.“I think the constant need to be connected to something outside of the space that you’re actually occupying is a detriment to your capacity to learn,” Ms. Fialko Casey said.Ms. Fialko Casey thinks students are stealthy when it comes to hiding phone use, and believes the problem is worse than what she sees.She frequently uses public shaming as a form of punishment for cellphone use, and also will remind students at the start of class to put them away.“I just try to come down pretty hard at the beginning of the year, and I take the phone right away,” Ms. Fialko Casey said.She recalled past years when iPads were provided to students as significantly worse for distraction.Ms. Fialko Casey has her own classroom policies, which include having some students hand in their phones at the door.“I also have some students that I ask to volunteer to put their phone on my desk, and I have some days as many as seven kids who will say, I need to be fully present to learn,” she said.She will take a cellphone immediately upon seeing it, and return it to the student at the end of class.“I’m trying to figure out a way to create a climate where it is a transgression to be on your phone,” Ms. Fialko Casey said."

AKA the most exhausting six months of my life.When family and friends would ask me how this oddly named disease felt, I would share with them think of the worst case of food poisoning that you’ve ever had, combine it with an epic hangover, the worst you ever experienced, then multiply that by about a million and that’s about one second of what it’s like to live with Hyperemesis.During my bed rest stint when many well-meaning family members and friends would call, email or come to visit they would often, unintentionally, make the kind of thoughtless commentary that to a suffering and hormonal pregnant women made you want to lose your mind. Literally. Or at least lose my lunch, oh wait, I already couldn’t keep that down anyway.There are many reasons that soon to be mothers might end up on bed rest, but regardless of why, there are some common remarks guaranteed to upset even the most patient soul. If you have a friend or family member on bed rest here is a helpful guide on what to never say and how to really understand what they need.1. “I WISH I COULD LAY IN BED ALL DAY”Nothing makes a sick pregnant woman feel more misunderstood then when they hear this comment. Bed rest is not an opportunity to lounge around all day and watch Netflix eating yummy snacks like the happily unemployed bliss of winning lotto. Bed rest is the equivalent of carrying the most precious thing you ever had across a high wire spanning sky scrapper. Your pregnancy is hijacked by illness and an assortment of debilitating symptoms and that time is spent filled with doubt and isolation, teetering on the edge and hoping you make it through and that your precious cargo is healthy.Bed rest is feeling removed from the real world, isolated, and giving up all the things you used to do. Basically, there is nothing “restful” about bed rest.Sometimes, a little empathy really goes a long way. A simple, “I know you must be feeling so cooped up inside by now, is there anything I can do to help?” makes all the difference.2. “I HAD A ROUGH PREGNANCY, TOO”This is often relegated to moms on bed rest as an attempt to empathize and let them know you understand what they are going through. While we do appreciate that, but truthfully unless you were severely sick, in the hospital, and/or stuck on bed rest for months, please know that it is just truly not exactly the same.If you were still at work and out doing things when you were pregnant (I wish!) then this attempt at shared empathy doesn’t always come off as understanding and can feel more like a dismissive, “pregnancy is always hard” sentiment. For those of us going through this bed rest ordeal it is waking up each day feeling sick, knowing you are stuck inside, can’t work, see friends, got to the gym, get a coffee, take a walk, pretty much do anything and it can really make a women feel miserable. It often feels like your own private hell, understood by no one except you.When people would say to me while I was on bed rest that they had morning sickness too, I would scream on the inside “this is not morning sickness; this is ALL day, every second sickness.” We do understand that this is just an attempt to share that you also had symptoms while you were pregnant and that you understand how hard pregnancy can be, but at this moment the best thing to really say is just how crappy you know this must feel and you are here to help in any way that you can. And letting us know we are totally kick ass for getting through this is always appreciated.3. “CAN I GET A DRINK?”If you are coming over to visit someone on bed rest please remember that this is not a time where they can really play host. They can’t serve drinks and food and do all the things they normally would. If a women on bed rest is in the thick of her illness, but has to keep getting up to do something and try to be a good host, then they are only reminded even more of what they can no longer easily do, that even the most basic tasks may now be beyond their ability. Instead, offering to bring over lunch, drinks or something we like is always an appreciated gesture. Even if we just end up throwing it up, the thought really goes a long way.4.”IT WILL ALL BE BETTER AFTER THREE MONTHS”For some reason, this theory seems to apply to just about everything when women are in their first trimester. No matter what they are suffering from, everyone always thinks it will magically go away after three months. But truthfully this logic is often based on nothing. The very nature of why we are on bed rest is because the doctors can never actually predict when something may resolve. Just a bunch of guesses and maybe this or maybe that. A large number of women have conditions that place them on bed rest that last well past three months. Since we have no way of knowing how long we are in the waiting game, this statement just reminds us even more that there is no definite date of when we will feel better. Plus, even if it did only last three months, three months is still quite a long time to be sitting in your bed, staring at those four walls. The best way to approach this is to offer to do something to help pass the time. Bring over some movies, music or an amazing book. Anything that helps us get through the day and recognizes the slow crawl of each moment when you are stuck in bed.5.”YOU LOOK GREAT, I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU ARE REALLY THIS SICK”Ahh the compliment hidden under the doubt of “can she really be that sick?”. When women are on bed rest people always assume they must look like night of the living dead, fangs out and all. But many of us feel worse if we are lying around looking like death, so we still try to shower and brush our hair, freshen up, put on clean pajamas and try to feel some semblance of our old selves. I pretty much could only leave the house when I had a Dr.’s appointment and once the doctor remarked “you look nice, are you going to a party after this?” Ha! If only…The kindest thing you can say to a woman at this time is just that despite all that they are going through they are handling it like a super hero, a pregnant superhero who, even with all of these challenges, still manages to look great! During my time on bed rest a friend once brought over some yummy candles and lotion and body scrubs and it was the closest I was going to get to a spa day at that time. Even better? When she painted my nails since I couldn’t go to the nail salon…it was a mini home spa day and cheered me up for the first time in weeks.Pregnancy can be a roller coaster for all of us and for those women living in the confines of their bed, it can just feel endless. Sometimes just hanging out with us, watching a movie, talking, and letting us know you are there can go such a long way in making us feel connected to the outside world.Of course bringing over some delicious chocolates always helps, even if we can’t keep any of them down!This article originally appeared on pregnantchicken.com"
10,POLITICS,This Probably Won’t Be The Craziest Republican National Convention In History,Sara Bondioli,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-national-convention-history_us_5787f49be4b08608d333b1e0,Nomination battles used to be fierce and often resulted in convention surprises.,2016-07-17,A crowd in Chicago's Auditorium Building during the 1888 Republican National Convention.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5789437f2400002700b316dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You can find speculation about what unusual things might occur during the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland all over the internet. But a little convention craziness might be more common than you think.The Republican Party’s first presidential nominating convention was held in Philadelphia on June 17, 1856. The event brought together a diverse group of people with a united focus on preventing the spread of slavery into the nation’s Western territories.Since then, the party has grown and changed ― and quite a few interesting moments have come from the conventions. Here are some of them.1864 (Baltimore): The aim of that year’s event was to preserve the union, so they called it the National Union party convention in hopes of encouraging Democrats, especially those who supported President Abraham Lincoln’s war plans, to participate.1876 (Cincinnati): Abolitionist Frederick Douglass gave the featured speech at the convention, in which he addressed the struggles of freed slaves: “You say you have emancipated us. You have; and I thank you for it. You say you have enfranchised us. You have; and I thank you for it. But what is your emancipation? What is your enfranchisement? What does it all amount to, if the black man, after having been made free by the letter of your law, is unable to exercise that freedom, and, after having been freed from the slaveholder’s lash, he is to be subject to the slaveholder’s shot-gun?”1888 (Chicago): Douglass received one vote, making him the first African-American to win a vote to be the presidential nominee of a major party.1912 (Chicago): President William Taft was ultimately chosen as the nominee, but former President Theodore Roosevelt was gunning for another chance at the White House. The establishment supported Taft, but Roosevelt and his supporters showed up at the convention in hopes of taking the nomination. When Roosevelt realized he wouldn’t succeed, he and his supporters left without voting. The new Progressive “Bull Moose” Party nominated Roosevelt later that summer.1916 (Chicago): The Republican and Progressive parties met concurrently in the Windy City in an attempt to come to a consensus on a candidate and platform. However, the Progressives were intent on nominating Roosevelt again, and the Republicans were set against his nomination. In the end, the parties selected separate candidates, but Roosevelt later withdrew from the presidential contest after meeting with GOP nominee Charles Evans Hughes.1924 (Cleveland): This was the first national party convention broadcast via radio. 1940 (Philadelphia): Wendell L. Willkie, who had never run for public office before, was a relatively unknown candidate just months before the convention. However, he gained momentum and secured the nomination on the sixth ballot.1964 (San Francisco): The top nominees represented the divide in the party: Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater led the conservative wing of the party, while New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller pushed for a more progressive agenda. Rockefeller was booed by conservatives in the audience when he pushed for a platform against extremism. And after he won the nomination, Goldwater fired back in his acceptance speech, saying, “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And...moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!”1976 (Kansas City, Missouri): California Gov. Ronald Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford, who had never been elected vice president or president, for the nomination. Neither candidate had enough support to win the nomination on the first ballot. Reagan, in an attempt to lure liberals and centrists to his side, did something that hadn’t been done before. He announced his vice presidential running mate before the convention: liberal Pennsylvania Sen. Richard Schweiker. His campaign then proposed a rule change to require Ford to name his running mate in advance, too, in hopes that Ford’s choice would send more votes Reagan’s way. The rule change was rejected, and Ford narrowly won the nomination. Ford, however, invited Reagan to the podium, where his poetic speech wowed the crowd and was seen to usher in the new generation of the party.2000 (Philadelphia): The nomination of George W. Bush gave the nation a chance to have its second father-son presidential pair. 2008 (St. Paul, Minnesota): The first day of the convention was held as an abbreviated session because of the threat of Hurricane Gustav, which was expected to hit Louisiana. Once the convention proceeded, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin became the second woman chosen for the presidential ticket of a major party.2012 (Tampa, Florida): For the second consecutive GOP convention, a hurricane derailed the first day. The events were condensed into the remaining three days.2016 (Cleveland): This year’s convention might be another memorable one."

The event brought together a diverse group of people with a united focus on preventing the spread of slavery into the nation’s Western territories.Since then, the party has grown and changed ― and quite a few interesting moments have come from the conventions. Here are some of them.1864 (Baltimore): The aim of that year’s event was to preserve the union, so they called it the National Union party convention in hopes of encouraging Democrats, especially those who supported President Abraham Lincoln’s war plans, to participate.1876 (Cincinnati): Abolitionist Frederick Douglass gave the featured speech at the convention, in which he addressed the struggles of freed slaves: “You say you have emancipated us. You have; and I thank you for it. You say you have enfranchised us. You have; and I thank you for it. But what is your emancipation? What is your enfranchisement? What does it all amount to, if the black man, after having been made free by the letter of your law, is unable to exercise that freedom, and, after having been freed from the slaveholder’s lash, he is to be subject to the slaveholder’s shot-gun?”1888 (Chicago): Douglass received one vote, making him the first African-American to win a vote to be the presidential nominee of a major party.1912 (Chicago): President William Taft was ultimately chosen as the nominee, but former President Theodore Roosevelt was gunning for another chance at the White House. The establishment supported Taft, but Roosevelt and his supporters showed up at the convention in hopes of taking the nomination. When Roosevelt realized he wouldn’t succeed, he and his supporters left without voting. The new Progressive “Bull Moose” Party nominated Roosevelt later that summer.1916 (Chicago): The Republican and Progressive parties met concurrently in the Windy City in an attempt to come to a consensus on a candidate and platform. However, the Progressives were intent on nominating Roosevelt again, and the Republicans were set against his nomination. In the end, the parties selected separate candidates, but Roosevelt later withdrew from the presidential contest after meeting with GOP nominee Charles Evans Hughes.1924 (Cleveland): This was the first national party convention broadcast via radio. 1940 (Philadelphia): Wendell L. Willkie, who had never run for public office before, was a relatively unknown candidate just months before the convention. However, he gained momentum and secured the nomination on the sixth ballot.1964 (San Francisco): The top nominees represented the divide in the party: Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater led the conservative wing of the party, while New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller pushed for a more progressive agenda. Rockefeller was booed by conservatives in the audience when he pushed for a platform against extremism. And after he won the nomination, Goldwater fired back in his acceptance speech, saying, “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And...moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!”1976 (Kansas City, Missouri): California Gov. Ronald Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford, who had never been elected vice president or president, for the nomination. Neither candidate had enough support to win the nomination on the first ballot. Reagan, in an attempt to lure liberals and centrists to his side, did something that hadn’t been done before. He announced his vice presidential running mate before the convention: liberal Pennsylvania Sen. Richard Schweiker. His campaign then proposed a rule change to require Ford to name his running mate in advance, too, in hopes that Ford’s choice would send more votes Reagan’s way. The rule change was rejected, and Ford narrowly won the nomination. Ford, however, invited Reagan to the podium, where his poetic speech wowed the crowd and was seen to usher in the new generation of the party.2000 (Philadelphia): The nomination of George W. Bush gave the nation a chance to have its second father-son presidential pair. 2008 (St. Paul, Minnesota): The first day of the convention was held as an abbreviated session because of the threat of Hurricane Gustav, which was expected to hit Louisiana. Once the convention proceeded, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin became the second woman chosen for the presidential ticket of a major party.2012 (Tampa, Florida): For the second consecutive GOP convention, a hurricane derailed the first day. The events were condensed into the remaining three days.2016 (Cleveland): This year’s convention might be another memorable one."

Though it was the most transparent of the attempts to tie Johnson to black militancy and/or the Black Lives Matter movement, it was only the most extreme expression of a widespread phenomenon.It was also dead wrong.After the shooting spree that lasted for several hours, Johnson was mortally wounded by a robot wielding an explosive. His final act was to write a note in blood ― “RB”. The desire to tie him to a black nationalist movement is so strong that there’s been serious speculation that he was trying to write “RBG,” which stands for “red, black and green,” the colors of the Pan-African flag. But in looking for meaning in the message, the media has missed the meaning in the act. The very act of writing in that moment places Johnson in the tradition not of the black militant, but of the American assassin.While he looked different, both politically and physically, from most well-known assassins, in the pantheon of American assassins, there was nothing unusual about Micah Xavier Johnson.In his book The Anatomy of Motive, FBI profiler John Douglas dissects a variety of crimes and criminals to determine what makes them tick. He pays special attention to what he calls “assassin type” personalities. Isolated, suspicious and armed to the teeth, assassin types have been responsible for some of America’s most iconic and heinous crimes. They are our mass shooters, our anonymous poisoners and our political murderers, but in their imaginations they are acting defensively. They are the victims.Douglas noticed that assassins were not grandiose, like the Charles Mansons of the world, but instead avoided eye contact. They were suspicious. They often had a deep sense of inadequacy. They were followers, not leaders. They were, routinely, domestic abusers to the extent they could maintain domesticity at all.The assassin has a “highly organized system” of paranoia, Douglas wrote. It is a system with causes, effects, enemies, traitors, actions, reactions ― and artillery. Lots of artillery. A peculiar feature of the assassin is that they often want to understand and be understood, so they write.They write journals, like Arthur Bremer. They write manifestos, like Chris Dorner. They write letters, like John Hinckley. They sometimes create detailed plans and schematics for their shootings, like Lee Harvey Oswald. And in some cases, like Charles Whitman, they combine these characteristics. Their writings ultimately reveal lives collapsing into themselves like black holes, absorbing relationships, jobs and opportunities while simultaneously growing more armed and lethal each day. Several days before fatally shooting 14 people and injuring more than 30 others at the University of Texas at Austin, Whitman wrote of his mental state, “I talked with a Doctor for about two hours and tried to convey to him my fears that I felt come [sic] overwhelming violent impulses. After one session I never saw that Doctor again, and since then I have been fighting my mental turmoil alone, and seemingly to no avail.”A journal was found among Johnson’s belongings, but its details have not yet been released.Assassins often document their political views, but they are usually conspiratorial and contradictory, if not incoherent. Because they’re all over the map, that gives partisans on both sides the opportunity to pull out a single quote or two in order to shoehorn the shooter into whatever ideological box is preferable. John Hinckley, Jr., the man who shot Ronald Reagan and three others in March 1981, wrote of a deep love and appreciation for John Lennon’s music. He was devastated by the musician’s death; he called it the “death of the dream.” However, Hinckley saw no contradiction between Lennon’s dreams of love and brotherhood and his own flirtations with white nationalism and later murder.Arthur Bremer’s politics were equally murky. He mocked his fellow Americans and their political disengagement. “A 50% voter turnout. Now THAT’S confidence in America!”, he wrote in his diary. Yet he did not himself vote. He made up for his personal avoidance of the ballot with a commitment to the bullet. In that, he was bipartisan and open-minded. He wrote of his admiration for George McGovern, while planning to assassinate him. He expressed a dislike for Richard Nixon, while preparing to shoot him also. He wrote mostly of indifference to George Wallace. Then he shot Wallace five times.Johnson seemed to be of a similar mindset. Authorities have said that he was probably “planning something bigger” but was moved to act more quickly by the twin police killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. His randomness of targets reflects an impulse that is common among assassins ― the world is the general target, while the specific victims wind up being arbitrary. As rational observers, we look at the victims’ identities and deduce from them a rational worldview that never existed.Johnson, according to the Associated Press, “liked” assorted “black militant groups” on Facebook, including the African American Defense League and the New Black Panther Party. There is a popular photo of him in a dashiki with his fist raised. This is not the person one would expect to shoot into a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters, endangering them and wounding a mother protecting her son ― unless that person is an assassin.The American assassin’s scope is ever-expanding, like the event horizon of the black hole. His “likes” are as unlikely to be targeted as his “dislikes.” The world is a target. It just needs justification and the justifications are endless. Quite often, assassins have been booted from the military (as Johnson was) or the police force, yet they remain drawn to it. They love the power of those institutions but the responsibilities intimidate and enrage them.Chris Dorner declared war on the Los Angeles Police Department in the winter of 2013. In his manifesto, Dorner is the victim of a vast, intersecting conspiracy that begins in his childhood and culminates with a frame-up job by crooked, craven LAPD cops. Yet even in his bitterest passages, one cannot help but notice Dorner’s love for all things military. His prose is an alphabet soup of military and police abbreviations and jargon. He was unjustly terminated in a BOR panel. His anticipated victims are “high value targets.” He knows the LAPD’s TTP’s (techniques, tactics and procedures) because, like John Rambo, they trained him. Yet Dorner’s victims were mostly civilians, not his hated enemies.Whitman, before his rampage, felt himself the victim of a similar betrayal. He was enrolled at the University of Texas and enlisted in the Marines on a special scholarship designed to increase the number of scientists in the military. He was to become an engineer and an officer to help the U.S. recover from the humiliation of the Soviet Union’s victories in the space race. However, Whitman’s habits of gambling, drinking, fighting and brandishing firearms made him a bad student and a worse soldier, so he lost his scholarship and left the military. He remained bitter and hostile toward the Marines until his death, but, like Dorner, spoke of his “mission” in military terms.Johnson expressed a similar sense of betrayal to his parents after having left the Army. It was not what he had “expected,” according to relatives. His mother said that “the ideal that he thought of our government, what he thought the military represented, it just didn’t live up to his expectations.”He had been accused of sexually harassing a fellow soldier, of stalking her and stealing her underwear. He lost his case but ― even to his attorney’s surprise ― somehow won an honorable discharge. His sense of loss and disappointment were profound, but did not mean a wholesale rejection of all things military. He worked out at a gym with local policemen. With his perceived failures his isolation grew. But did he know something was wrong? Charles Whitman and Chris Dorner, despite all of their rage against the machines, knew something was wrong with them personally. Both men requested that their brains be studied after their deaths. Dorner thought his problem might be severe depression. Whitman did not know, but it turned out that he had a lesion on his amygdala that some associate with violence.John Hinckley Jr. certainly knew something was wrong. He marveled at how easily he could acquire handguns. He spent most of his adult life shuttling between the homes of relatives, schools, psychiatrists and gun stores. He once had a cache of weapons seized at an airport in Tennessee. He was detained briefly, hopped on a plane back to Texas, visited his favorite pawn shop and rearmed. No questions asked.Hinckley wrote in his diary “Guns are neat things aren’t they? They can kill extraordinary people with very little effort. But don’t tell the NRA.”His attempted assassination did lead to reforms, though ― but not of gun laws. Hinckley pled not guilty by reason of insanity and won, infuriating many in Congress who then fast-tracked insanity plea reforms. The next Hinckley would have a tougher time proving that he was insane, but no problem arming himself and doing something nuts like Johnson. Johnson bought an AK-47 from someone he met on Facebook. The guy “checked him out,” meaning that he looked at his Facebook profile and thought he seemed like a good guy. So, he sold him the gun.Johnson’s dashiki and “likes” worry many in a way that his cache of weapons does not. His outfits ― and his skin color ― made him an “other” in a way that his isolation, contradictions and penchant for violence did not. America tolerates the assassin and assassinations, but Black Lives Matter… they’re dangerous."

By this point in their story, any dreams of making it big had all but vanished.Lennon and McCartney, in particular, had grown increasingly despondent about the Beatles’ chances of making it in the business. It was, indeed, a far cry from their earlier, halcyon days, as John remembered them in his own words, when “I would yell out, ‘Where are we going, fellows?’ They would say, ‘To the top, Johnny,’ in pseudo-American voices. And I would say, ‘Where is that, fellows?’ And they would say, ‘To the toppermost of the poppermost!’” But those days were long gone. By this point, the band mates had to be wondering about the “real” jobs that would, sooner or later, come calling.But as history well knows, a growing cascade of events would begin to coalesce in November of that year, when Brian Epstein, their future manager, took in one of their Cavern performances and saw his life’s work unfold before him on that dank basement’s tiny stage. By the following June, Brian had parlayed their emergent good fortune into a penny-per-record contract with EMI’s Parlophone label, led by A&R man George Martin.During this period, big changes in the group’s calculus were in the offing. By August, Best had been ejected from the band’s fold after Martin had taken issue with his drumming prowess, or lack thereof, during the band’s June 1962 session at Abbey Road. Enter Ringo Starr, and quite suddenly the Beatles’ braintrust was in place. With Epstein handling their business affairs and Martin acting as their musical director, John, Paul, George, and Ringo were poised to take Great Britain, and later the world, by a very well-choreographed storm.In The Geography of Genius, Eric Weiner contends that game-changing artistic fusions like the Beatles often emerge in precise, historically favorable moments that nurture their inherent talents. With the Beatles, a host of factors involving an advantageous nexus of time and place come into play. For Epstein, Martin, and the band, the “geography of genius” was the postwar British record industry, supercharged by the transistor radio and ready and waiting for the next big thing. But the “genius cluster” that brought them into being was, quite arguably, the collaborative efforts of the band, their manager, and their producer.As it turned out, musical talent and industry know-how were not necessarily their greatest assets, as one might reasonably surmise. No, their most significant advantage—possibly even their secret weapon—was their collective outsider status. Hailing from Liverpool, the Beatles themselves were de facto outsiders in a class-conscious nation dominated by the cultural capital of London. But Epstein and Martin were also outsiders of a sort in their own right, with the former finding his mettle in his family’s North Country record shop and the latter toiling away for more than a dozen years at tiny Parlophone, EMI’s downtrodden “third label.”As Weiner pointed out during an NPR interview, “Someone who is fully invested in the status quo is not going to be a genius.” Simply put, “They’re not going to rock the boat.” By Weiner’s definition, a genius is “almost always an outsider. But I want to say they’re not fully outsiders. They’re what I call insider-outsiders.”In a sense, the Beatles were insider-outsiders themselves. In Weiner’s way of thinking, insider-outsiders possess the requisite skills to compete, yet rarely find acceptance within the mainstream; hence, they have little interest in preserving the industrial status quo.In their own ways, Epstein and Martin afforded the Beatles with the signal ingredient in their future success when they were able to glimpse the band mates’ peculiar form of genius that had, for the most part, gone unrecognized. For Brian, that ingredient was the “star quality” that he observed during that first lunchtime concert by the band back in November 1961. As he later wrote, “I thought their sound was something that an awful lot of people would like. They were fresh and they were honest and they had what I thought was a sort of presence, and—this is a terrible, vague term—‘star quality.’ Whatever that is, they had it—or I sensed that they had it.”Martin experienced a similar reaction after meeting the group at Abbey Road in June 1962. He had approached the entire experience with a sense of reluctance, only to be pleasantly surprised after his first meeting with the Liverpudlians. But as it turned out, it wasn’t their beat band talent that had bowled him over. As Martin later remarked, “It wasn’t their music, it was their charisma, the fact that when I was with them they gave me a sense of well-being, of being happy. The music was almost incidental. I thought, ‘If they have this effect on me, they are going to have that effect on their audiences.’” In short, he was absolutely charmed by them, by their personalities far more than their music at this stage. As George later recalled, “You actually felt diminished when they left.”The striking similarities inherent in both Epstein and Martin’s reactions to the band are vital to understanding the Beatles’ emergent genius, as well as the manager and producer’s own roles in preparing them for mass consumption on the world stage. By the time that Beatlemania had left its imprint on the world, branding the Beatles as geniuses would become the norm.But back in those heady, pre-fame days, Epstein and Martin arrived at a likeminded conclusion about the band’s seemingly limitless potential—even when the rest of the industry wouldn’t so much as turn a blind eye in their direction. By joining forces with the band mates, Epstein and Martin essentially established a kind of “genius cluster” of hardworking outsiders who, individually and collectively, could have cared less about preserving the status quo of an industry that had, at various times, refused to accept them.Decades later, thinkers about culture and creativity like Weiner easily brand the Beatles’ musical fusion as the product of a kind of genius. But in Weiner’s estimation, genius such as theirs isn’t necessarily born or made. “Genius is grown,” he points out. Weiner’s definition of genius also accounts for the key role of consensus in its emergence. “A genius is someone we all agree on is a genius,” he adds. “It’s a social verdict.”While the Beatles’ aspects of genius may have been latent in the early 1960s, in many ways their recognition by Epstein and Martin—and for reasons beyond their musical talent—was the making of them. It was the product of a kind of genius, by Weiner’s definition, in and of itself. Ken Womack is an internationally renowned Beatles authority regarding the band’s enduring artistic influence. His next book, Maximum Volume: The Life of Beatles Producer George Martin (The Early Years: 1926-1966), is forthcoming in 2017.

John Bel Edwards called the assault a “diabolical attack on the very fabric of society” during a press conference that afternoon.“That is not hyperbole,” he added, also vowing to leave “no stone unturned” in the ongoing investigation into the incident.Authorities have identified the gunman as Gavin Eugene Long of Kansas City, Missouri. The New York Times reports that Long appears to have posted a video in which he talks about fighting back against police brutality with violence, rather than peaceful protest. Sunday, the day of the shooting, was his 29th birthday.In an interview with the Times, Louisiana State Police Public Affairs Commander Lt. J.B. Slaton said Long “was targeting officers” and “definitely ambushed” them.“We are still trying to find out what his motive was,” he said, “and that’s going to be part of our investigation. But we believe he was targeting those officers.”Authorities have said Long was the only gunman, but are looking for anyone who may have had advance knowledge of the attack or who may been a co-conspirator.“If there are others out there, we’ll bring them to justice,” Baton Rouge Mayor Kip Holden said during the press conference with Edwards.He closed the event with a quote from the Bible that he said symbolized the city’s resolve: “Yea, though you slay me, I will rise again...”Long killed Baton Rouge Police Officers Montrell Jackson, 32, and Matthew Gerald, 41, as well as East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Deputy Brad Garafola, 45.Another deputy was critically wounded, and two officers suffered injuries that were not life-threatening. The killings come less than two weeks after a Baton Rouge man was shot to death by police in a case that drew national attention.“To me, this is not so much about gun control as it is about what’s in men’s hearts, and until we come together as a nation, as a people, to heal as a people, if we don’t do that and this madness continues, we will surely perish as a people,” East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux said Sunday.“Each one of these individuals, married,” he said. “Each one of these individuals have family.”According to Marine Corps records, Long had a conventional tour in the Marines. He served for five years and retired as a sergeant in August 2010 with an honorable discharge. During that time, he was trained as a data network specialist and attended the Marine School of Infantry, indicating that he received infantry training. He also served as a communications specialist in Iraq from June 2008 to January 2009 and served in Okinawa with the 3rd Marine Air Wing. Nothing in the records indicates any disciplinary actions against him.The Sunday morning shootings happened in less than 10 minutes. Officers were responding to a call about a man dressed in all black and carrying a gun.The Hammond Aire Plaza, where the shootings took place, is about a mile south of police headquarters and about five miles away from where Alton Sterling was shot and killed by local police on July 5.Sterling’s death sparked protests and nationwide outrage after video showed two officers overtaking him before shooting him. Other footage also appears to show that Sterling, who was black, was not holding a gun when he was shot.In the aftermath of Sterling’s death, Jackson wrote on Facebook of the difficulties he faced patrolling the city, the Times reported.“I swear to God I love this city but I wonder if this city loves me. In uniform I get nasty hateful looks and out of uniform some consider me a threat,” he wrote.“This city MUST and WILL get better,” he continued. “I’m working in these streets so any protesters, officers, friends, family or whoever, if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer. I got you.”Sunday’s killings also follow police deaths in Dallas less than two weeks ago. In that case, Micah Xavier Johnson, a 25-year-old Army veteran, shot and killed five police officers and injured seven others as a Black Lives Matter protest was winding down. He had no association with the group.The Dallas shooting claimed the lives of officers Brent Thompson, Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Michael Smith and Lorne Ahrens.Dallas Police Chief David O. Brown tweeted his condolences for Baton Rouge police on Sunday.In a press conference Sunday afternoon, President Barack Obama urged unity among racial and political groups.“Five days ago I traveled to Dallas for a memorial service of the officers that were slain there,” he said. “I said that that killer would not be the last person who tries to make us turn on each other, nor will today’s killer. It remains up to us to make sure that they fail. That decision is all of ours. The decision to make sure our best selves are reflected across America, not our worst.”Earlier Sunday, Obama offered his full support to local, state and federal agencies in a statement, while calling the attacks “the work of cowards who speak for no one.”Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday called the killings a “despicable act ... an attack on our very way of life at home” during a speech in Melbourne, Australia.Ryan Grenoble contributed to this report.

18,TRAVEL,So What's Bali Like?,"Paul La Rosa, ContributorI am a journalist, husband, father and human....",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/so-whats-bali-like_us_578bd73ae4b0cbf01ea0140a,I’ve been asked that question a lot since I returned from a two-week vacation in Bali so let me try and put my thoughts in,2016-07-17,"<strong><em>One of the ubiquitous temples of Bali, this one at Maya Sanur Resort</em></strong>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578bd7e619000016008a6aab.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I’ve been asked that question a lot since I returned from a two-week vacation in Bali so let me try and put my thoughts in order. For openers, Bali is exotic, beautiful and exciting with a fascinating culture and very friendly people. Not bad...I confess to knowing so little about Bali before I went I actually thought it was a city but....no. It’s an island―part of Indonesia―and when one decides to go, one has to pick which cities one will visit. Since I outsource all my travel decisions to my wife, it was her trip. I didn’t focus on the individual cities until we got there.We first went to Ubud which is where the last part of the memoir “Eat, Pray, Love” takes place. Sad to say that the book and the film have done the town in. The rice terraces have been sold off to make room for hotels and restaurants; the whole place feels a bit from the Indonesian version of Lake George. There are still charming parts and it’s still a yoga mecca but overall, the town is very crowded with bad traffic and way too many motorbikes. I’d skip it. But I did love our hotel― the Komaneka Bisma where we had our own private infinity pool facing the jungle. In Ubud―reportedly at the top spa―we paid $12 for one-hour high quality massages and a local told us we were paying the Western price, that locals paid about $4. No matter, it was still a great deal.Lest I make too little of Ubud, it does feature traditional dancing a few times a week, has interesting public temples and nearby towns filled with silver and woods smiths so there is culture to be had. It’s just crowded!Next we made our way to Amed, a tiny fishing village where we had a cottage on the beach. The hotel―Life in Amed―was cute and small; the opposite of our first hotel but it was one-quarter of the price. The beach was packed with local fishing boats and the fishermen families who lived there. We chatted with them constantly whether we wanted to or not. The Balinese are very friendly and will try to sell you pretty much anything to bring in a few rupiah.Speaking of the Indonesian Rupiah, I should mention how jarring it is to routinely be talking in terms of 100,000 rupiah which is all of $7.50. I once withdrew two million rupiah from an ATM. That’s $150 to you Uncle Sam. It’s so weird to hand someone 20,000 rupiah for a tip. I thought it was a handsome sum until I realized I was tipping someone $1.50 for a six hour guided tour!Our last stop was Sanur which, for me, was the best stop. We stayed in the Maya Sanur, only a year old and it was a beautifully designed modern hotel that I embraced. For the first time in our stay, I felt I could actually see things in our hotel room (the others had very poor lighting). The hotel also featured―as part of the cost of the room―a breakfast buffet and there are few things in life I like more than a breakfast buffet. The hotel was also right on the beach which featured a stone boardwalk dotted with dozens of small restaurants where you could sit at the best table right on the beach and get the freshest fish, no problem.Our trip was a mix of sightseeing and relaxing by the pool. We visited ancient holy temples, took a Balinese cooking class, did a lot of yoga at outdoor studios, went snorkeling and swimming but the highlight for me was eating at the home of one of our drivers. (If you’re interested, his name is Gede Mardika)His family was very poor but seemingly quite happy. As the only son, it was his obligation to care for his parents and bring in money. The vast majority of Balinese―no matter how poor―live in family compounds, literally walled spaces that feature a cooking area, a living area, a sleeping area and a temple. Even our very poor driver lived in a compound and had a mini-temple in the northeast corner.Generally, the youngest male cares for the parents and lives with them his entire life. His wife will move into the family compound and she’d better get along with his mother because she’ll be living with her until one of them dies.The Balinese―who don’t often emigrate for reasons stated above―don’t have a concept of meals the way Westerners do. There is no breakfast, lunch and dinner. A pot of food―generally rice and vegetables―is prepared early and it’s enough for the day. When you’re hungry, you grab a plate and that’s that.Our driver’s parents were rice farmers and had never learned to drive a motorized vehicle. They walked each day, every day to the rice fields where they worked about 15 minutes away. They were able to keep 40% of the rice they harvested but received no money. The boss kept 60%. The boss got 60% of everything from the pigs on the compound to the money our driver earned. It was his van after all although the whole thing struck me as very medieval.There was no electricity at this family compound. Food was cooked on two fires, one of which was fed by bamboo and the other fed by coconut husks. EVERYTHING was recyclable. Our plates were the broad leaves of the banana plant and we ate with our hands. The meal was fish satay (mackerel), long beans with coconut, rice of course and watermelon for dessert. It was all delicious and, the entire time, I was just marveling at our driver’s four year old son and nine year old sister. New York City parents would have had multiple heart attacks had they been there and watched as the kids danced around the open fires. At one point, our driver handed a very sharp machete to his nine year old sister who skipped away, holding it gingerly.There is a malady suffered by westerners called Bali belly but, as we winged home (25 hours in the air), we congratulated each other on not getting sick. Well, turns out I got terribly sick the day after I returned. It was a bacterial infection―the most common type of bacteria associated with food poisoning―and for three days it knocked me flat.But at least I didn’t get sick while there or on the plane and for that, I am thankful. It was a eye-opening experience and I would go again. I hope you enjoy these photos."

It was not only all over the Internet, it was also all over the news.Amazing stuff?Of the hunters who were chased by the lion?Incredible.Increasingly, the web and the evening news (for anyone who still watches it) are filled with amazing moments captured on video.And why not? With more than 2 billion smart phones with video cameras, and a seemingly insatiable appetitie to shoot everything that happens to us, and share it, isn't it inevitable that every once in a while someone would get something extraordinary? An infinite number of typewriters and an infinite number of monkeys, and one of them is sure to end up writing King Lear.Well, as it turns out, some (and probably more than some) of these are fakes.The Woolshed Company has been engaged in a two-year project to fake eight viral videos to 'explore the phenomenon of viral videos and shared content.'Experiment over, they now go public and admit that, yes.. they are fake, and yes... we are idiots.This raises two questions:First, if these are fake, how many others are fake? My guess is, a lot more.Second, (and perhaps more interesting) is why do we so readily believe them?Let me answer the second question first.We now have more than 500 years of experience with a 'democratized' free press. That is, it has been more than 500 years since anyone with an idea, no matter what the idea, has been able to get their hands on a printing press (more or less), and print whatever they wanted to.We like this idea so much that we have enshrined it as the very First Amendment in our Constitution.A Free Press.Well, 500 years of exposure to a free press has taught us not to always believe what we read. If you go into a supermarket and you see a tabloid with the headline ""BAT BOY FOUND ON MARS"", you don't go running home to hide in your bomb shelter... nor do you immediately call all your friends and 'share' the news about the Martian Bat Boy.You look at the headline, shrug and say to your self, ""why are those avocados so expensive?'You don't care.Video, on the other hand, occupies a different place in our consciousness.It is somehow more 'real', more to be believed. We don't have the innate discount factor that we instantly apply to text.If we see a woman snowboarding down a mountain being chased by a bear, we immediately go 'holy smokes' (or some other word that begins with an s), and share it with all our friends.That's viral video.But why do we 'believe' video so much more rapidly than we do text?It's because, until yesterday, at least, video was only made by the 'special people'. That is, it was expensive, complicated and difficult to make. It was made by, clearly, only believable people, like CNN or NBC or someone like that. This belief was deeply embeded in us for more than 50 years. It's a visceral response.Video must be real... mustn't it?Clearly not.Not anymore.And it will take us some time to begin to accept the idea that if you saw it, it must be real.It isn'tWhich takes us to the next (or rather first) question. If the bear chasing the woman down the mountain isn't real... well... what if a lot of other stuff that we have seen on video or TV isn't real either?Here's the bad news.Probably... it isn't.And if it isn't fake now, it most likely will be more and more faked in the future.This is no bad thing... this knowledge not to trust everything you see.Right now, you see a video of some atrocity (I will leave the specifics to you) and the whole country (or the whole world) erupts in outrage.No one is outraged about the bear... but there a lot of other things that people see that outrages them.(Did you see the video of that Serbian guy shooting the Archduke??? I am outraged!)As video making (as opposed to viewing) expands and explodes... we are going to have to rapidly develop the same degree of media maturity toward video that we innately have toward print.Maybe it was true.... and maybe it wasn't.Let's find out first.Outrage can wait.And should. originally posted in TheVJ.com"

I can just about manage that in my ninth decade, though doubtless with mighty puffings, mighty complainings and mighty cursings. No, it's the vertigo, that crescendo of panic, that tingling in the thighs, that cowering back balanced with the contradictory urge to inch forward. After all, I'm not an 'It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Superman' person. Far from a soaring eagle, a worm's eye view from down here will do very nicely, thank you very much. Atop Pulpit's Rock - tourist brochureBesides, three years ago a Spanish tourist became the first to fall to his death. He was about to leave the tabletop when he said he was just going to take a few more photos. The next thing his companions heard was a blood-curdling scream as he disappeared over the edge. His smashed body was found the following day.I'm surprised there haven't been many more fatalities. Of course, there's that jokester who in 2011 produced the YouTube 'Myles falls off Preikestolen and dies,' showing the prancing idiot mincing up and down and waving his arms as if afflicted with third stage syphilis, then disappearing to a cry of 'shit shit' as the camera pans down the rock face.That valiant feat elicited such comments as 'his ""oh shit!shit!"" ....It could have been more convincing.' 'WHAT a load of crap!' And 'Theres one site where its only going 1 m down but its still dangerous cause if you slide away from that Meter area youre death.' So when nearly everybody alights from the boat from Stavanger to make the four-hour hike up and back - young, old, babes in arms, a group of Spanish women past middle age, even a dog - I'm quite comfortable in my cowardice. After all I recall that disastrous effort decades ago in Australia to climb Ayers Rock when it was still called that and scaling it was permitted. I got 12 feet off the ground, that's all, a mere 12 feet, when I became completely catatonic. I couldn't take a step either up or down. I was rooted to the rock like an outcropping. It took an eternity for me to finally crab my way back down.Then there was the time we climbed up the Mayan pyramid in Chichen Itza. Well, I got up alright, but then I couldn't get back down again. Our kids, of course, were up and down like the mountain goats that they are, and Rivka wisely stayed put on terra firma. But I just whimpered at the top like a whiney little bitch, cowering, unable to move. After several eternities I managed to side crab-scuttle and bum my way back down.So, on this gloriously sunny mid-June day I'm quite happy to gaze 1,982 feet upwards to the projecting rectangle with the clean cut lines so exquisitely carved out by Nature. The fjord is magnificent, its light grey precipices splendid with trees sprouting out of cracks in the rock and waterfalls tumbling down. Even Edvard Grieg's ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" reaching a crashing crescendo from the ship's loudspeaker at a spot called Vagabonds' Rock, though corny, is not offensively so. Pulpit's Rock is only a quarter of the way up the fjord and it's possible to take a bus tour from Stavanger to Lysebotn at its very end and return by regular ferry. So here I am sitting in splendid isolation on a 47-seater tourist bus. Such is the beauty of off-season, or in this case pre-peak, travel. Today is the first day of the bus tour season, running from June 11 to August 31 only. With just one customer the guide buggers off and leaves me to the mercy of the driver, who speaks good English and is a great guy. It's gloriously sunny and the countryside is, again, spectacular. The first stop is Byrkjedalstunet, a little village with turf-roofed houses built in the style of 100 years ago. Goats are clambering over sheds. As we pass through Sirdalen valley, successive waves of mountains, forested, lichen-covered or bare grey, recede in folds to the horizon, enveloping green V- and U-shaped valleys, farmland, plunging waterfalls, tranquil lakes and rushing rivers. A swathe of rocky destruction down a wooded mountainside bears witness to a landslide that closed the road for two days last week. We climb above the tree line to a boulder-strewn plateau with wide patches of snow and precipitous ravines.At Øygardstøl, the Eagle's Nest, we're literally overhanging Lysebotn, a precipitous 2,700 feet below us. The panorama is stunning; the fjord threads its way between sheer cliffs while a green valley stretches out in the opposite direction, narrowing to massive crag walls. I'm OK here because there are high railings as I gingerly look down. But another thing I will not be doing is hiking 800 feet further up a humongous boulder, where even now I can see ant-like humans pressing onwards and upwards to the Kjerag sheer-drop plateau. It necessitates six hours there and back, serves as a launch pad for base jumpers - those parachuting and wingsuit-flying idiots who think they're superman - and would doubtless work wonders for my vertigo.I don't think anybody's yet fallen off there, but you do of course have a YouTube post, titled 'FATAL visit to Kjerag' in which an idiot wearing a ghastly black and white decorated sweater fakes it. It elicited the following comment: 'If you wear a sweater like that, you deserve to die.' A third thing I will not be doing is roller-skiing 2,700 feet up the 27 hairpin bends of the road from Lysebotn to Øygardstøl, as a new group of idiots are doing, using enormous amounts of elbow grease as they frantically pole away. Instead, I progress royally down it in my bus-chariot through a dozen mountain tunnels. One, a single lane over a mile long with a few laybys for oncoming cars, twists 180 degrees.A fourth thing I won't be doing, assuming that by some divinely-inspired injection of foolhardiness I did venture up Kjerag, is perch-posing atop Kjeragbolten, a boulder wedged in a mountain crevice above a 3,228-feet void, atop which more idiots dance and prance for the camera.   From the tourist brochureIf a cruise ship is in Stavanger this daredevil wait can stretch to an hour or more. I'm more than satisfied just looking up at it from the fjord, once more a worm.From the worm's perspective And a fifth thing I will not do is climbing up the 4,444 wooden steps at Flørli, where the ferry is now stopping, celebrated as the longest wooden stairway in the world. The driver says it buggers up your knees on the way back down. It was built by workers constructing one of the many hydroelectric plants that give Norway 90 percent of its power, many of them buried deep inside mountains.All in all, sedate perhaps, but most enjoyable.[Upcoming blog next Sunday: Norway's iconic Lofoten islands]______________ By the same author: Bussing The Amazon: On The Road With The Accidental Journalist, available with free excerpts on Kindle and in print version on Amazon.

So when nearly everybody alights from the boat from Stavanger to make the four-hour hike up and back - young, old, babes in arms, a group of Spanish women past middle age, even a dog - I'm quite comfortable in my cowardice. After all I recall that disastrous effort decades ago in Australia to climb Ayers Rock when it was still called that and scaling it was permitted. I got 12 feet off the ground, that's all, a mere 12 feet, when I became completely catatonic. I couldn't take a step either up or down. I was rooted to the rock like an outcropping. It took an eternity for me to finally crab my way back down.Then there was the time we climbed up the Mayan pyramid in Chichen Itza. Well, I got up alright, but then I couldn't get back down again. Our kids, of course, were up and down like the mountain goats that they are, and Rivka wisely stayed put on terra firma. But I just whimpered at the top like a whiney little bitch, cowering, unable to move. After several eternities I managed to side crab-scuttle and bum my way back down.So, on this gloriously sunny mid-June day I'm quite happy to gaze 1,982 feet upwards to the projecting rectangle with the clean cut lines so exquisitely carved out by Nature. The fjord is magnificent, its light grey precipices splendid with trees sprouting out of cracks in the rock and waterfalls tumbling down. Even Edvard Grieg's ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" reaching a crashing crescendo from the ship's loudspeaker at a spot called Vagabonds' Rock, though corny, is not offensively so. Pulpit's Rock is only a quarter of the way up the fjord and it's possible to take a bus tour from Stavanger to Lysebotn at its very end and return by regular ferry. So here I am sitting in splendid isolation on a 47-seater tourist bus. Such is the beauty of off-season, or in this case pre-peak, travel. Today is the first day of the bus tour season, running from June 11 to August 31 only.

As we pass through Sirdalen valley, successive waves of mountains, forested, lichen-covered or bare grey, recede in folds to the horizon, enveloping green V- and U-shaped valleys, farmland, plunging waterfalls, tranquil lakes and rushing rivers. A swathe of rocky destruction down a wooded mountainside bears witness to a landslide that closed the road for two days last week. We climb above the tree line to a boulder-strewn plateau with wide patches of snow and precipitous ravines.At Øygardstøl, the Eagle's Nest, we're literally overhanging Lysebotn, a precipitous 2,700 feet below us. The panorama is stunning; the fjord threads its way between sheer cliffs while a green valley stretches out in the opposite direction, narrowing to massive crag walls. I'm OK here because there are high railings as I gingerly look down. But another thing I will not be doing is hiking 800 feet further up a humongous boulder, where even now I can see ant-like humans pressing onwards and upwards to the Kjerag sheer-drop plateau. It necessitates six hours there and back, serves as a launch pad for base jumpers - those parachuting and wingsuit-flying idiots who think they're superman - and would doubtless work wonders for my vertigo.I don't think anybody's yet fallen off there, but you do of course have a YouTube post, titled 'FATAL visit to Kjerag' in which an idiot wearing a ghastly black and white decorated sweater fakes it. It elicited the following comment: 'If you wear a sweater like that, you deserve to die.' A third thing I will not be doing is roller-skiing 2,700 feet up the 27 hairpin bends of the road from Lysebotn to Øygardstøl, as a new group of idiots are doing, using enormous amounts of elbow grease as they frantically pole away. Instead, I progress royally down it in my bus-chariot through a dozen mountain tunnels. One, a single lane over a mile long with a few laybys for oncoming cars, twists 180 degrees.A fourth thing I won't be doing, assuming that by some divinely-inspired injection of foolhardiness I did venture up Kjerag, is perch-posing atop Kjeragbolten, a boulder wedged in a mountain crevice above a 3,228-feet void, atop which more idiots dance and prance for the camera.   From the tourist brochureIf a cruise ship is in Stavanger this daredevil wait can stretch to an hour or more.

Up to 250,000 tourists hike it a year.Well, Yours Truly is not about to make it 250,001. It's not the climb that worries me.

24,POLITICS,This Bill Could Automatically Register 50 Million People To Vote,Jacquie Lee and Mercy Yang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/automatic-voter-registration-bill_us_5789563ae4b08608d334a58e,"Congressional Democrats propose making it easier to vote, not harder.",2016-07-16,"There are currently 50 million Americans who are eligible to vote, but aren't registered. A new bill introduced to Congress this week could change that. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5789566e2400002700b31734.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A bill introduced this week in Congress could automatically make as many as 50 million people eligible to join the electorate.Democratic lawmakers proposed what they call the Automatic Voter Registration Act of 2016 to streamline the registration process.Voter turnout in the U.S. typically falls behind other developed countries. In 2014, 37 percent of Americans showed up to the polls, the lowest voter turnout in the U.S. in more than 70 years, according to Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.“Our system is broken and in need of dire repair,” Clarke told The Huffington Post. “This bill is one step that Congress can take to meaningfully make it easier for Americans to participate in elections in our country.” Five states ― California, Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia ― already have automatic voter registration laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School. The bill, introduced by Rep. Robert Brady (D-Pa.) with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), complements the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires certain government offices to offer voter registration to people signing up for public benefits or a driver’s license, for example.Under the proposed legislation, citizens seeking assistance at these or other government agencies — whether they’re renewing their drivers license, applying for public benefits, looking to register a firearm or signing up for classes at a public college — will be automatically registered to vote. If someone so chooses, they may decline the registration.The goal is to cut the hassle from the registration process and expand voting accessibility, Clarke said.States like New York require voters to register weeks ahead of Election Day, and deadlines come and go without notice for some potential voters. Even Donald Trump’s children, Ivanka and Eric, missed the deadline, barring them from casting ballots for their father during New York’s primary. But voting barriers typically hit low-income or minority voters hardest. In 2012, fewer than half of people registered to vote who had an income of $20,000 or less showed up at polls, compared with 77 percent of voters with incomes over $75,000. Socioeconomic factors help explain this disparity, including lack of transportation, the high cost of a government-issued I.D., demanding work schedules, or long lines at the polls. Asian-Americans and Hispanic-Americans have the lowest voter turnout rates among all racial groups in the U.S., according to 2014 census data. But Asian- Americans who are registered to vote have turnout rates as high as white and black Americans, underscoring how removing the registration hassle may make a difference.“We do know that once Asian-Americans register, they turn out to vote at rates comparable to non-Hispanic whites,” said Terry Ao Minnis, Director of Census and Voting Programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice. “That’s the people who previously took the steps to register,”However, filling out a voter registration form presents a layer of difficulty, especially for the one-third of Asian-Americans with limited English proficiency, Minnis added. “For Asian-Americans, voter registration is the biggest barrier after citizenship when it comes to closing the voting gap,” Alton Wang, communications and development associate at Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, told The Huffington Post. Clarke said the legislation could serve as a countermeasure to the 2013 Supreme Court decision that gutted aspects of the Voting Rights Act. After the decision, states like Texas, North Carolina and Georgia implemented voter ID laws and other measures that made it harder to vote. Unless lower courts intervene, those restrictions may be in place for the first time in a presidential election.“Our union can only become stronger and more representative with the participation of a broader electorate,” Leahy said in a statement.

25,POLITICS,Donald Trump Says He's Raised $51 Million. The Actual Numbers Are Starting To Come In.,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-fundraising_us_5789a550e4b03fc3ee510ddb,Is it really $51 million?,2016-07-16,Donald Trump raised $32 million for two committees connected to the Republican National Committee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5789a5fb19000026008a68e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says he raised $51 million in conjunction with the Republican National Committee and state party organizations in June, his first full month of fundraising from donors. Unknown when he announced this haul last week was how it would be split between his campaign, the RNC, and special RNC accounts that can’t be used for the 2016 election. Thanks to two campaign finance filings on Friday, the breakdown of the funds is becoming clearer.Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee linking the Trump campaign, the RNC and 11 state parties, raised $25.7 million in June and the final week of May. The Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee linking the Trump campaign and the RNC, raised $6.7 million over the same time period.So far, the Trump Victory campaign has transferred only $2.2 million to the Trump campaign. Another $10.1 million was transferred to the RNC, but only $4.3 million of that is available for the RNC’s general election fund. The rest is split between three special party accounts ― convention, building and legal ― that were created by the Republican-controlled Congress in the 2014 omnibus budget bill. The convention account got $3.3 million, the building account got $1.5 million, and the legal account got $1 million. The committee ended the month with $12 million in undistributed funds.The Trump Make America Great Again Committee has not yet distributed its funds to either the Trump campaign or the RNC. It appears that nearly all, if not all, of its $6.7 million in contributions will wind up in the Trump campaign’s coffers. This is because the largest contributions are $5,400, the maximum a donor can give to the Trump campaign. Every dollar over $5,400 would rebound to the RNC. The Trump Make America Great Again Committee was one vehicle the Trump campaign used to raise small-donor funds online, and it shows. The majority of its funds ― $4.3 million ― were raised from donors giving under $200.Overall, the two joint fundraising committees raised $32.6 million ― $18.4 million short of Trump’s announced $51 million. That difference could have all been raised by Trump’s campaign. Or not. It is Trump, after all.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

A Republican congressman said Obama had reaped “what he has sowed” with the police killings.Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) even tweeted that Obama and Black Lives Matter protesters should “watch out” because “real America” was coming for them after the shooting. (That tweet has since been deleted.)Noah told The Huffington Post Thursday that he thinks Obama’s critics would rather have the president ignore the problems of police brutality and racial discrimination in our criminal justice system.“You have a very dangerous and, I would say, uninformed position in America where there are many people who believe that the way to deal with a problem is to not speak about it,” Noah said. “There are people who would say President Obama is inciting violence because he is speaking about these issues, but that is not how issues go away ― you don’t stop speaking about them.”Obama said the killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two black men who were fatally shot by police in separate incidents within the same week, were symptomatic of “a broader set of disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.” At the same time, Obama noted, police have a “dangerous job” and have to make “split-second decisions.”“To be concerned about these issues is not to be against law enforcement,” Obama said.Noah made a similar argument on his show the night of the Dallas shooting, arguing that it’s possible to be both “pro-cop and pro-black.”“You know the hardest part of having a conversation surrounding police shootings in America?” Noah said on his show. “It always feels like in America, it’s like, if you take a stand for something, you automatically are against something else. It’s such a strange world to be in.”Noah told HuffPost the issue of police brutality itself hasn’t changed, citing the Rodney King riots and other instances from past decades, but argued that the conversation has evolved thanks to cell phones and social media.“It is much harder to deny what you are seeing, and yet still people try and find ways to justify the deaths of unarmed citizens or people that could have [been] unarmed and the situation de-escalated,” Noah told HuffPost.Noah argued that people who blame Obama for the violence are just angry he’s addressing a longstanding problem in America.“What you are in essence accusing him of is not glossing over these divisions and playing the game of wearing rosy-colored glasses to act like the thing is not happening,” Noah said, “when in fact, it is.”Read more:CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Noah made his ""pro-black and pro-cop"" remark after the shooting in Dallas; in fact that segment aired on the night of the shooting."
28,POLITICS,Donor Behind $1 Million Dark Money Super PAC Contribution Revealed,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/super-pac-llc-contribution_us_57896d7ae4b03fc3ee51058b,A wealthy hospital executive tried to hide a contribution through an LLC.,2016-07-16,A super PAC linked to Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop (pictured) revealed the source of a controversial $1 million donation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585867421800002d00e43912.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Two of the biggest dark money contributions made to super PACs in past year have been either revealed or returned, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission on Friday.Coalition for Progress, a New Jersey based super PAC, refunded a $400,000 contribution from the nonprofit group Progressive New Jersey Inc., according to its latest quarterly filing with the FEC. The super PAC also filed an amended report to show that a $1 million contribution made by DE First Holdings LLC should be attributed to Vivek Garipalli, founder of the for-profit hospital company CarePoint Health.Both contributions were major news stories in northern New Jersey, where Coalition for Progress has been linked to Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, a Democrat who is considering a gubernatorial bid in 2017. Campaign finance watchdogs in Washington, including Campaign Legal Center, Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed complaints with the FEC, arguing that these contributions were not allowed because they masked the original donor’s identity.The Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and subsequent lower court rulings legalized unlimited corporate, union and individual spending on elections, so long as it remains independent from candidates and political parties. There has been a sharp increase in undisclosed, or dark money, spent in election campaigns at the federal, state and local levels. This has included contributions laundered through limited liability companies and nonprofit groups to super PACs, which must disclose their donors.The $1 million contribution from DE First Holdings now attributed to Garipalli shows this problem. DE First Holdings was created as a Delaware corporation on Dec. 23, 2015. The very next day, it donated $1 million to Coalition for Progress. There was no identifying information showing the true owner or operator of the company, or the source of the money.“There’s something inherently wrong with setting up a trust like this,” Esther Wintner, a Jersey City activist involved with the government reform group Civic JC, which has protested the undisclosed nature of the contribution, told The Huffington Post. “It does really give an appearance that someone is trying to hide their donation.”In the 2012 elections, retired Bain Capital executive Ed Conard attempted to hide his $1 million contribution to a super PAC supporting his former boss, Mitt Romney, through an LLC called W Spann. In his case, W Spann LLC took itself out of business immediately after making the contribution. Conard eventually came forward amid media coverage of the donation.There have been dozens of cases since then, including during the 2016 elections. A $1 million contribution to Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC by Jasper Reserves LLC was revealed to be given by billionaire coal baron Chris Cline. A contribution to a pro-Ted Cruz super PAC by V3 231 LLC turned out to be from the wireless entrepreneur and developer Chaim Nash. Dozens of other LLC contributions could be traced to specific addresses and likely human donors.In the case of the DE First Holdings contribution, Coalition for Progress president Bari Mattes issued a statement saying only, “We are updating our report to change the identification of a contributor from DE First Holdings to Vivek Garipalli.”Garipalli’s spokeswoman, Lynda Dorf, said in an email: “DE First Holdings was formed for the primary purpose of making commercial investments, and it has made and continues to make such investments in addition to charitable donations and contributions.“The amendment was filed by the CFP, but we agree with the amendment and can confirm that its content is accurate and we support the filing,” Dorf’s statement continued. “The contribution was made in full compliance with FEC rules, regulations, and guidance.”Garipalli and CarePoint Health are powerful players in New Jersey politics. CarePoint owns three hospitals in North Jersey’s Hudson County, including Christ Hospital in Jersey City. Garipalli also has a history with Jersey City Mayor Fulop. When the city’s ambulance contract was up for grabs in 2013, Fulop declared that the city would award the contract to CarePoint. The contract was scuttled and the process reopened in 2014. The city’s longtime ambulance provider, Jersey City Medical Center-Barnabas Health, was ultimately awarded the contract.It’s still unclear whether Coalition for Progress will emerge as a vehicle to support a potential Fulop gubernatorial bid. In its most recent filing, the super PAC showed that it contributed $50,000 to House Majority PAC, a super PAC supporting Democratic congressional candidates. "

At least 84 innocents lost their lives in France, including 10 children. More than 200 were hurt, and scores remain on life support.On Friday morning, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan extended his sympathies to the grieving nation.Hours later, Erdogan’s country descended into violent chaos of its own.The Turkish military declared it had seized control of the nation, prompting mass protests in the streets as tanks rolled through gunfire and explosions.Addressing Turks via live broadcast from his phone, Erdogan urged citizens to unite against the attempted takeover. He denounced the coup as “an act of treason” and later said it had failed.Seventeen police officers have reportedly been killed. A helicopter was shot down by an F-16 fighter jet, a presidential source informed The WorldPost. Hundreds of people have died, and more than 1,400 are injured.Turkey, gripped by political tensions, was still reeling from suicide bombings that rocked Istanbul’s Ataturk airport just weeks ago, leaving dozens dead and hundreds wounded.In France, violence has also become all too common.The French have endured 10 notable terrorist incidents since the start of last year. In January 2015, gunmen invaded the office of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and fatally shot 12 people. In November 2015, terrorists in Paris killed at least 129 people in multiple attacks across the city.Now, in a painfully familiar state of grief, the nation mourns yet again.What in the world is going on?"

Kennedy International Airport had their plans tossed into uncertainty Friday evening as news of a possible coup took over airport television screens.Though Turkey-bound flights were departing on schedule, passengers at JFK’s Terminal 1 waiting to board an Istanbul-bound Turkish Airlines flight were nervously checking news on their phones as airline staff showed up. The gate agent said she had no information, and a pilot said he was worried.“I’m sorry for the country,” said the pilot, who said he couldn’t give his name. “We love our country, and we always want to be in a stable situation.” Alisa Velic, 32, of Stamford, Connecticut, was traveling with three friends to Zagreb, Croatia, via Istanbul.“It’s scary,” Velic said. “But, you can’t stop living life, and you can’t have situations like this prevent you from living life. We kind of talked about this on the drive to the airport ― why is this happening all over the world? France yesterday, Turkey today. Granted it’s a different situation. But you gotta go.”Chris Sassi, 63, of New York, was headed to Istanbul on his way to Algeria to visit family. “I asked my daughter to check if there was any lateness with the plane, and she screamed, ‘Daddy, it’s a coup in Turkey!’” Sassi said. “I just told my daughter that everything was okay, that we don’t have to worry. But I am worried.” Sassi said an unstable Turkey sends a worrying message to the rest of the world.“I know Turkey before and after Erdogan,” said Sassi, referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “I always love Turkey because it’s an example of democracy in a Muslim country that was working. And it can be a mirror to the world that democracy and Islam can work together.”He added: “When I go back to Turkey, it’s the link to me between East and West, and it’s an example, spiritually and religiously.” Then he checked his phone for news. “I don’t have a clue what will happen,” Sassi said. “I love Turkey, and I hope ― I hope ― that democracy will be sustained.” "

And at least one contributor seemed more disappointed in their performance than relieved that the coup has thus far failed to topple a democratically elected government.Leading the pack was Robert Baer, a veteran former CIA officer and author ― and, apparently, a former coup participant.Baer told CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that the Turkish coup was “not professionally done.”“I have been involved in coups before,” he said. “They should have taken CNN Turk and closed it down the first minutes, the radio station, social media, the internet. Even if they didn’t arrest [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, they should have taken care of all of that right at the beginning.”Baer also revealed that he had discussed the possibility of a coup with Turkish military officers in the past few months.“I’ve been speculating with Turkish officers a couple months ago about a coup and they said, ‘Absolutely not,’” he said. “And clearly they’re not involved, so there’s limited support for this.”Baer went on to acknowledge that the prospects of the coup’s success were bleak, but he argued that it could still prevail.“If the Turkish army, these elements, want to go to war with the people, it would mean civil war,” Baer concluded. “And right now, it doesn’t look like it, but you know tomorrow is another day. And certainly people in the Turkish military aren’t certain ― or the government.”James Woolsey, a former director of the CIA who has advocated for the hanging of National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, offered his analysis of the Turkish coup on CNN earlier in the evening, arguing that it was a tactical failure.“With coups, as with military operations, the plans never survive the first part of the operation,” Woolsey said. “You have to be flexible enough to change your tactics as you’re going through. And it doesn’t sound like these coup plotters had that kind of flexibility.”Woolsey, who said he spent six months in Turkey last year, went on to imply that the coup need not change the U.S.’ close relationship with the country.“I think there’s one thing ― this is not a happy situation and things may turn very sour ― but there is one positive aspect at least, that I’d be willing to share,” he said. “Turkey is a prosperous and progressive place with its workforce.” “We need [Turkey] and we need to work with it and we need to have it work with us,” he concluded.Retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former leader of NATO’s presence in Europe, appeared on CNN in the same segment as Woolsey. (Turkey is a member of NATO.)While Clark shared the criticism of the coup’s tactics, he was more careful to clarify that he was not supportive of military insurrections.“The thing about these coups ― and we are certainly not encouraging it; we are discouraging it ― but history shows that if you are going to execute these coups, you have to really mean it,” Clark said.Fighting between pro-coup army officers and the civilians and security forces supportive of the government has resulted in the deaths of at least 265 people, according to The New York Times. By Saturday morning, the coup appeared to be in its last throes. Coup soldiers occupying major bridges in Istanbul surrendered to forces loyal to Erdogan, while the government detained thousands of troops implicated in the attempted takeover. Erdogan returned triumphantly to Istanbul, the country’s largest city, on Saturday and his resumption of complete control of the country appears imminent. The commentary of the former CIA officials about the Turkish coup is particularly notable because of the CIA’s long history of facilitating coups in foreign countries with an eye toward advancing U.S. geopolitical or financial interests. This was especially true during the Cold War, when the U.S. toppled numerous foreign governments around the world that it perceived to be too sympathetic to the Soviet Union.The CIA is believed to have been at least passively complicit in a number of Turkish military coups since 1960. The U.S. military and intelligence agencies worked closely with Turkey’s national security establishment, sometimes called the “deep state” due to its hidden influence over Turkish politics, as part of the United States’ Cold War-era alliance with the country. The U.S. has historically also been a partner in the Turkish military operations against Kurdish separatists in the southeastern part of the country ― operations that have routinely drawn criticism from human rights groups. For example, the U.S. helped Turkey find and capture Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan in 1999.Notwithstanding some of the ambivalent-sounding commentary of former CIA officers, the Obama administration has been unequivocal in its support of the democratically elected Turkish government. “The President and Secretary [of State] agreed that all parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed,” the White House said in a statement late on Friday."

As of Saturday morning, nearly 3,000 people have been rounded up, ranging from foot soldiers to senior officers, Reuters reported. ​”Turkey has a democratically elected government and president. We are in charge and we will continue exercising our powers until the end,” Erdogan said. “We will not abandon our country to these invaders. It will end well.”Turkish military forces had declared a takeover of the country late Friday, but government leaders quickly insisted that the coup attempt would not succeed.Tanks rolled through the streets and the sound of gunfire and explosions rang out in ​Istanbul and Ankara, sparking fear and confusion about who was in control. Later, crowds of people poured into the streets in protest.The nearly ousted president was greeted by crowds of supporters when he emerged at the airport the following morning, according to images broadcast on Turkish television.The coup was declared Friday in a military statement read on TV, in which armed forces expressed concerns about rising autocratic rule and increased terrorism. The statement said martial law and a curfew would be imposed in the country.But Erdogan, speaking to CNN Turk using FaceTime late Friday, appealed to people to resist the challenge to his power.“I urge the Turkish people to convene at public squares and airports,” he said to CNN, according to a translation of the statement from a presidential source. “There is no power higher than the power of the people.”Several senior military figures also spoke out against the coup and predicted it would fail, adding to public confusion about the extent of the support within the military for the takeover.Turkish police under Erdogan have routinely cracked down on protests ― most recently a peaceful gay pride demonstration in Istanbul ― using water cannons, batons and tear gas. Nonetheless, in the wake of Erdogan’s appeal, crowds of people flooded the city of Istanbul and blocked the streets with their cars, HuffPost Arabi reported. Mosques broadcast appeals calling on people to protest the coup.Images on social ​media showed people congregating in public squares in Istanbul and Ankara, some clambering on tanks, others waving Turkish flags. ​Micah Hughes, a 26-year-old University of North Carolina student who is studying in Istanbul, told The WorldPost that his street was full of demonstrators who tried to block the passage of military vehicles and tanks deployed to the neighborhood.“Protesters were on top of all of them waving flags and blocking their movement. Slowly the soldiers emerged and the protesters were clapping and allowing them safe passage out, hugging them as the soldiers waved some flags,” Hughes said.Long lines of people chanting slogans and vehicles honking horns proceeded down a highway in Istanbul, according to a video from HuffPost Arabi. Earlier on Friday, the prime minister had acknowledged the attempted military uprising during a broadcast on NTV television. Turkey would never allow any “initiative that would interrupt democracy,” Yildirim vowed.“Some people illegally undertook an illegal action outside of the chain of command,” he said. “The government elected by the people remains in charge. This government will only go when the people say so.”Military jets and helicopters buzzed over the cities of Istanbul and Ankara, sending car alarms wailing, as forces closed Istanbul’s two main bridges across the Bosphorus strait.Witnesses reported the sound of shots and explosions in the capital, and images and footage shared on social media appeared to show flashes of gunfire in Ankara’s night sky.People shared images of tanks rolling through the streets of Istanbul and Ankara. Tanks pulled into the entrance of Ataturk airport ― the largest in the country ― according to Turkish television news reports.Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported early Saturday morning that 17 police officers were killed when a helicopter attacked the police special forces headquarters on the outskirts of Ankara. Meanwhile, the presidential source told The WorldPost that an F16 fighter jet shot down a helicopter, which he said had been hijacked by the coup plotters.Turkish state media said the Turkish parliament in Ankara was hit by a bomb, and the Turkish news site Odatv published photos purporting to show the debris inside the building.Amidst the chaos, the country’s interior minister, Efkan Ala, argued early Saturday that Turkish police and most of the military, including the top ranks, would counter the coup attempt, which he described as being perpetrated by “gangs.” He urged Turkish citizens to “fearlessly go out and support our security forces.”Government officials blamed supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a popular Islamic cleric from Turkey now based in Pennsylvania, for the coup ― a charge his followers in the U.S. strongly denied. “Comments by pro-Erdogan circles about the movement are highly irresponsible,” the Alliance for Shared Values said in a statement.“It’s possible that this is only a faction of the military,” Henri Barkey, director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told The WorldPost Friday evening. “The fact that they did not arrest Erdogan means they don’t have things totally under control.”“My guess is that this is not an army working in unison. They are looking for allies. They are trying to convince other units to join them. Once they have momentum, they think other units will join them. It’s a very risky operation,” Barkey continued.The U.S. Embassy urged American citizens to seek shelter. “Do not go to the U.S. Embassy or Consulates at this time,” a statement read. The U.S. State Department similarly had an emergency message for Americans in Turkey on Saturday morning:An excerpt released from a phone call between President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed hope that all parties in Turkey would “support the democratically-elected Government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed.”Opposition parties, including the Kurdish-led People’s Democratic Party (HDP), also spoke out against the coup effort.“HDP is under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup,” the party leaders said in a statement.“This country had suffered a lot from the coups. We do not [want] these difficulties to be repeated,” said Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, head of the Republican People’s Party, according to Hurriyet Daily News.Access to Twitter and Facebook appeared to have been slowed and blocked, even with a virtual private network, in some parts of the country. The Turkish government frequently throttles the internet after major events like terrorist attacks.An employee of Turkish state-owned media outlet TRT World in Istanbul told The WorldPost that their office was forcibly cleared by armed men on Friday and that the staff’s phones were taken.Just after midnight Saturday morning, Lucas Thorpe, an assistant professor of philosophy at Bogazici University in Istanbul, tweeted that at least 50 people were lined up at an ATM in hopes of withdrawing money following the coup announcement.Turkey joined NATO in 1952 and had a string of military coups in the following decades, the last of which took place in 1980. Erdogan has ruled Turkey since 2003, first as prime minister before assuming the presidency in 2014.“We urge the world to stand in solidarity with the Turkish people,” a presidential source said Friday. “Those who perpetrated this attack against Turkish democracy will be swiftly brought to justice.”As the sun rose in Turkey Saturday morning, it was still too early to say conclusively that the coup effort had failed, but there were early indications that ousting Erdogan would be hard. This latest uprising differed from past military coups in Turkey in that it was never clear that the top military brass was behind the effort.“If you look at Turkey’s history of military coups, right after the coup you usually hear top generals on TV explaining to the public why a coup is necessary.

As of Saturday morning, nearly 3,000 people have been rounded up, ranging from foot soldiers to senior officers, Reuters reported. ​”Turkey has a democratically elected government and president. We are in charge and we will continue exercising our powers until the end,” Erdogan said. “We will not abandon our country to these invaders. It will end well.”Turkish military forces had declared a takeover of the country late Friday, but government leaders quickly insisted that the coup attempt would not succeed.Tanks rolled through the streets and the sound of gunfire and explosions rang out in ​Istanbul and Ankara, sparking fear and confusion about who was in control. Later, crowds of people poured into the streets in protest.The nearly ousted president was greeted by crowds of supporters when he emerged at the airport the following morning, according to images broadcast on Turkish television.The coup was declared Friday in a military statement read on TV, in which armed forces expressed concerns about rising autocratic rule and increased terrorism. The statement said martial law and a curfew would be imposed in the country.But Erdogan, speaking to CNN Turk using FaceTime late Friday, appealed to people to resist the challenge to his power.“I urge the Turkish people to convene at public squares and airports,” he said to CNN, according to a translation of the statement from a presidential source. “There is no power higher than the power of the people.”Several senior military figures also spoke out against the coup and predicted it would fail, adding to public confusion about the extent of the support within the military for the takeover.Turkish police under Erdogan have routinely cracked down on protests ― most recently a peaceful gay pride demonstration in Istanbul ― using water cannons, batons and tear gas. Nonetheless, in the wake of Erdogan’s appeal, crowds of people flooded the city of Istanbul and blocked the streets with their cars, HuffPost Arabi reported. Mosques broadcast appeals calling on people to protest the coup.Images on social ​media showed people congregating in public squares in Istanbul and Ankara, some clambering on tanks, others waving Turkish flags. ​Micah Hughes, a 26-year-old University of North Carolina student who is studying in Istanbul, told The WorldPost that his street was full of demonstrators who tried to block the passage of military vehicles and tanks deployed to the neighborhood.“Protesters were on top of all of them waving flags and blocking their movement. Slowly the soldiers emerged and the protesters were clapping and allowing them safe passage out, hugging them as the soldiers waved some flags,” Hughes said.Long lines of people chanting slogans and vehicles honking horns proceeded down a highway in Istanbul, according to a video from HuffPost Arabi. Earlier on Friday, the prime minister had acknowledged the attempted military uprising during a broadcast on NTV television. Turkey would never allow any “initiative that would interrupt democracy,” Yildirim vowed.“Some people illegally undertook an illegal action outside of the chain of command,” he said. “The government elected by the people remains in charge. This government will only go when the people say so.”Military jets and helicopters buzzed over the cities of Istanbul and Ankara, sending car alarms wailing, as forces closed Istanbul’s two main bridges across the Bosphorus strait.Witnesses reported the sound of shots and explosions in the capital, and images and footage shared on social media appeared to show flashes of gunfire in Ankara’s night sky.People shared images of tanks rolling through the streets of Istanbul and Ankara. Tanks pulled into the entrance of Ataturk airport ― the largest in the country ― according to Turkish television news reports.Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported early Saturday morning that 17 police officers were killed when a helicopter attacked the police special forces headquarters on the outskirts of Ankara. Meanwhile, the presidential source told The WorldPost that an F16 fighter jet shot down a helicopter, which he said had been hijacked by the coup plotters.Turkish state media said the Turkish parliament in Ankara was hit by a bomb, and the Turkish news site Odatv published photos purporting to show the debris inside the building.Amidst the chaos, the country’s interior minister, Efkan Ala, argued early Saturday that Turkish police and most of the military, including the top ranks, would counter the coup attempt, which he described as being perpetrated by “gangs.” He urged Turkish citizens to “fearlessly go out and support our security forces.”Government officials blamed supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a popular Islamic cleric from Turkey now based in Pennsylvania, for the coup ― a charge his followers in the U.S. strongly denied. “Comments by pro-Erdogan circles about the movement are highly irresponsible,” the Alliance for Shared Values said in a statement.“It’s possible that this is only a faction of the military,” Henri Barkey, director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told The WorldPost Friday evening. “The fact that they did not arrest Erdogan means they don’t have things totally under control.”“My guess is that this is not an army working in unison. They are looking for allies. They are trying to convince other units to join them. Once they have momentum, they think other units will join them. It’s a very risky operation,” Barkey continued.The U.S. Embassy urged American citizens to seek shelter. “Do not go to the U.S. Embassy or Consulates at this time,” a statement read. The U.S. State Department similarly had an emergency message for Americans in Turkey on Saturday morning:An excerpt released from a phone call between President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed hope that all parties in Turkey would “support the democratically-elected Government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed.”Opposition parties, including the Kurdish-led People’s Democratic Party (HDP), also spoke out against the coup effort.“HDP is under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup,” the party leaders said in a statement.“This country had suffered a lot from the coups. We do not [want] these difficulties to be repeated,” said Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, head of the Republican People’s Party, according to Hurriyet Daily News.Access to Twitter and Facebook appeared to have been slowed and blocked, even with a virtual private network, in some parts of the country. The Turkish government frequently throttles the internet after major events like terrorist attacks.An employee of Turkish state-owned media outlet TRT World in Istanbul told The WorldPost that their office was forcibly cleared by armed men on Friday and that the staff’s phones were taken.Just after midnight Saturday morning, Lucas Thorpe, an assistant professor of philosophy at Bogazici University in Istanbul, tweeted that at least 50 people were lined up at an ATM in hopes of withdrawing money following the coup announcement.Turkey joined NATO in 1952 and had a string of military coups in the following decades, the last of which took place in 1980. Erdogan has ruled Turkey since 2003, first as prime minister before assuming the presidency in 2014.“We urge the world to stand in solidarity with the Turkish people,” a presidential source said Friday. “Those who perpetrated this attack against Turkish democracy will be swiftly brought to justice.”As the sun rose in Turkey Saturday morning, it was still too early to say conclusively that the coup effort had failed, but there were early indications that ousting Erdogan would be hard. This latest uprising differed from past military coups in Turkey in that it was never clear that the top military brass was behind the effort.“If you look at Turkey’s history of military coups, right after the coup you usually hear top generals on TV explaining to the public why a coup is necessary. That has not happened yet,” Gönül Tol, director of the Middle East Institute’s Center for Turkish Studies, told The WorldPost as events unfolded Friday evening.If Erdogan defeats these opponents, Tol predicted that he will use the episode to further consolidate his own power and push for a full presidential system of governance ― an effort that was already underway when Erdogan forced Ahmet Davutoglu out as prime minister earlier this year.“He will play off of fears, warn of the dark years of the 1970s and 1980s, and use the coup to push forward his own agenda,” Tol said.Listen to President Erdogan’s statement (in Turkish) below:This is a developing story.

Two of my most favorite things in the world, right where I want them. As I look at her, I wonder if she’ll also grow up to be like her mom, always a book, or now kindle, by her side. I wonder if she too will fall in love with reading and live her happily ever after amidst pages of written words. And then a question pops up in my mind.How do I make my four-month-old fall in love with reading?Call me crazy but I really, really want to show her this world of books. I want her to experience the need to read just one more page before turning in for the night. I don’t just want to introduce her to this amazing world of books but I want her to feel it, love it and connect with it too.But, what can I do to make her see reading the way I do?You have no idea how much I have pondered on this. All through my pregnancy and every day these past four months since I first held her in my arms. And then it hit me. Maybe the answer lies in my childhood. It was, what you call, the-eureka-moment.If I remember correctly, I was about two and a half to three years old when my dad first started telling me stories while feeding me. It was his way to get around my tantrums while eating. The tales he wove were my reward for behaving at the dinner table. As days passed, I found myself eagerly waiting for meal time with dad. Not for the food but for the next new story that he had in his repertoire. I was hungry to hear more, imagine more. I think that was the whole reason books became my best friends when I was old enough to read. I wanted to hear more stories so I started looking for them in books. And I don’t know when but reading became an inseparable part of me. So, I think I know where I have to start.Makes stories her reward. The sooner the better.When my daughter is old enough to understand, I’ll start with telling her stories that I grew up on. A story or two while tucking her in, one while getting her to eat her food and maybe even while driving her to the crèche. The point is to make her see stories as a reward, as a gift and make her yearn for it. So, every time she does something that deserves an accolade, encouragement, I’ll offer her a story too. Maybe then she’ll grow an appetite for more which in turn will lead to reading when the time is right.To pique her interest in reading, I need to read in front of her, with her.One of the things that children do always is take after their parents. They have a keen sense of observation and nothing escapes their inquisitive eyes. That is something I plan to play on to get the reading bug to bite her. I never ever go to bed without reading a few pages. This is my nightly ritual. Even if I’m dog tired, I do it. So, maybe when she sees me do it every day, she’ll do the same. It could be our mother-daughter thing at the end of the day, read books together.Introduce her to the amazing word of bookstores.When you have kids, trips to the amusement park, the movie hall where, say, the Kung Fu Panda is being played or even the Dunkin Donuts, become a norm. These are things that kids enjoy and look forward to doing. So, I think along with these trips to bookstores, if done right, could also make introducing them to reading much easier. And to achieve just that, I plan to take my daughter to a bookstore at least once every month. It could be another of those things that we do as a mother-daughter duo, just spend hours and hours lost in aisles of books, with books. So many stories under one room. That ought to entice her, right?It’s not that I wish to shove reading forcefully down her throat. I want to do it right because I know how wonderful it is. And it’s not just discovering stories or leading many lives by virtue of these stories that I want her to grown fond of. There’s more to it. Reading equips you better for life, I feel. And I want that for her. I want books to be her friends too and we all know that’s a lasting bond.So, tell me, do you have any suggestions for me? How can I help my daughter discover the beauty of this magical world of books and reading?A version of this post appeared on the author’s blog.For readers, she is just a click away on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram."

In 2011, Gingrich said: “I am convinced that if we do not decisively win the struggle over the nature of America, by the time they’re my age, they will be in a secular atheist country, potentially one dominated by radical Islamists.” Gingrich has not yet explained how an atheist transformation of America will be dominated by radical Islamists for whom a belief in One God is central to faith. Driven by an inflated self-concept of competence, Gingrich says things and then spends a lifetime retracting his foolery. Gingrich’s proposal of making belief as a ground for deportation cannot be taken seriously. Of course, illegal Muslim immigrants can be deported without any reason. But deporting legal immigrants on grounds of belief will be a radical development in immigration law. The immensity of the Gingrich proposal ignores that millions of American Muslims are citizens of the United States, both naturalized and native-born. Under the proposal, American Muslims born in the United States, like Representative Keith Ellison, who might believe in the Shariah, will stand deportation. But deported to where remains an unresolved riddle. In making dubious statements, Former Speaker of the House Gingrich comes across as a graceless leader who, as a prior lawmaker, should know better. What is Shariah?It appears that Gingrich, like some other scared critics of Islam, has a poor understanding of the Shariah. The critics of Islam identify Shariah with terrorism, burqa, and harsh criminal punishments such as stoning for adultery. The fear of the Shariah is widespread, particularly among white male circles, as is the fear of African Americans. Prompted by panic, prejudice, and phobia, some state legislators have passed constitutional amendments or legislation against the enforcement of Shariah in state courts, ignoring the First Amendment protections of religious freedom. Fortunately, the federal courts have struck down the attempts to de-legalize Shariah.For practicing Muslims, Shariah is a set of beliefs and a code of rules that govern the daily life of individuals and families. Foremost, Shariah means a belief in One God and respect for prophets, including Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Shariah regulates, among numerous things, the times of prayers, the rituals of prayers, the times of fasting in the month of Ramadhan, and the amount of mandatory charity annually dispensed to the poor and the needy.Shariah also instructs Muslims to speak truthfully but gently, be kind to children, keep the aging and sick parents at home, respect the privacy of neighbors, refrain from cruelty to animals, reject adultery and take care of an ill spouse. The Shariah also carries the complicated rules of inheritance, trusts, donations, partnership, financing, arbitration, evidence, judicial ethics, and rational proof-based judgments. In the Middle centuries, the common law of England freely borrowed from the rules of the Shariah. Many Shariah rules are similar to Jewish law freely practiced and officially recognized in the United States. The U.S. Constitution protects the free exercise of Islam, that is, protects the Shariah that Muslim families practice in living spiritually satisfying lives. For the most part, the Shariah and the Constitution are compatible. In matters of incompatibility, there is no possibility that the Shariah would modify the U.S. Constitution; or, the state and federal courts would enforce any elements of the Shariah that violate the Bill of Rights or any other deeply embedded legal values. Whipping up the fear that the Shariah undermines the U.S. Constitution is based on faulty assumptions and lack of knowledge.If there is any danger to the integrity of the Constitution and American values of religious liberty, it comes from provocateurs like Trump, Cruz and Gingrich. Many well-informed Americans, including Mike Pence, Trump’s pick for the vice president, oppose the hatred against Islam and American Muslims trumped up by politicians, evangelists, neocons and other dubious characters."

It is not a darker side of me, or a reflection of me. It is just me. It tries to make sure I never believe in my ability as a writer, and when I do have success, it tells me my achievement is short lived and is a fluke. It’s a Goddamn liar, and these are the lies it told me before I decided to kick its ass out of my head.1. YOU ARE BORING!I used to be taunted by my flashing cursor and fingers paralyzed above my keyboard. At the flinch of my forefinger anxiety told me no one wants to read my words because I am uninteresting. I slam my laptop shut and duck from my office, defeated. I felt safe from failure for a moment, but then shamed. My thoughts bullied me, minimized me, and forced me to waste talent.2. YOU’RE STUPID!This lie is pervasive because it affected me in several settings. While working with therapy clients, anxiety told me my insights were way off, and they were wasting their money. At parties I avoided conversations because anxiety told me I knew nothing about the world. Parties can be boring when you think you too stupid to talk about anything.3. YOU’RE A SHITTY PARENT!Anxiety used to tell me I was ruining my kids. It whispered stuff like, “They are better off without you” or “They love their mother more.” It mattered little that anxiety had no evidence to support its claim. Anxiety never needs evidence to convince anyone of anything.4. YOU’RE A FRAUD!I have sat in many clinical team meetings with colleagues who have become friends. When we discussed each others clients to provide support and insight to each other, I clammed up all the time. Anxiety would whisper, “they are all smarter than you” or “nothing you have to say will help.” It didn’t matter my opinion was sought by my colleagues. Anxiety knew more than everybody, so I listened to it.I am staggered by the extent to which lies generated within me limit my potential, stunt my growth, and wag wasted yesterdays in the face of finite tomorrows. It is not a dreadful thought, but a real one I hope motivates me to disprove propaganda in my head keeping me from realized potential, self-actualization, and achievement beyond the realm of what doubt allows me to believe possible. I do not fear death, but I do fear my unique thoughts and ideas dying with me; ideas deserving of chances to burst through doubt, shine, and be as realized as I hope to one day be."

But there was also an undeniable sense of uncertainty in a country already wracked by polarizing politics and terrorist attacks.“I congratulate all citizens who resisted the coup attempt,” Turkey’s Prime Minister, Binali Yildirim, said Saturday, insisting that the situation was “completely under control” after a night of shocking bloodshed.“Right now, we’re focused on catching the perpetrators and bringing them to justice,” he added.At least 265 people were dead as of Saturday afternoon, according to a Turkish government official, 104 of them described as “assailants.” Some 1,440 were left wounded and 2,839 detained. Turkey says the coup attempt was carried out by members and supporters of the Gulen Movement, a Sunni Muslim group led by Erdogan’s arch-rival, Fethullah Gulen, who currently lives in self-imposed exile on a compound in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. A Gulen-linked group called the Alliance for Shared Values has denied involvement in the coup attempt. Fears are now rising that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will carry out harsh reprisals against opponents and try to consolidate power in the aftermath of the turmoil. Turkey is still reeling from terrorist attacks carried out by the self-described Islamic State and by Kurdish militants. Many Turks were out for blood after Erdogan, who said he dodged an assassination attempt on Friday, called on Turkish citizens to fill the streets in protest.One unverified video shared widely on social media appeared to show a lone police officer protecting a petrified soldier, accused of supporting the coup, from an angry mob. Other videos online appeared to show military tanks mowing down pro-government protesters.Violence peaked early Saturday morning. At one point, a fighter jet shot down a military helicopter reportedly flown by pro-coup forces that was attacking the parliament complex in Ankara while legislators hid in a parliamentary shelter. “It was frantic,” one employee of Istanbul’s Haydarpasa Numune Hospital, who asked not to be named, said of last night’s rush to save lives. “Still, there are wounded people who haven’t been able to get any treatment.”On Twitter, the hashtag #idamistiyorum, meaning “I want the death penalty,” went viral, with many demanding the ultimate punishment for those they deemed traitors.Yıldırım said Saturday that while Turkey’s constitution forbids the death penalty, the country will “consider legal changes” in light of the coup attempt. Early on Saturday, Erdogan described the failed overthrow as treason and pledged a harsh outcome for those behind it.“They will pay a heavy price for their treason to Turkey,” he said.Erdogan ― still a popular, although increasingly controversial political leader ― has long been attempting to shift more authority toward his office, and has pushed for a revised constitution that would establish an executive presidency in Turkey.Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) won majority rule in Turkey’s elections last November, reviving the prospect that the president would strengthen his grip on the country’s political landscape. Six months later, Erdogan ousted prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, evidently out of concern that his once-ally could place a check on his own power.Opposition politicians and analysts have viewed Erdogan’s aspirations to a U.S.-style executive presidency as a worrying sign of his increasingly authoritarian streak. In recent years, Erdogan has cracked down on dissent within Turkish media, built a lavish palace for himself and arrested Gulenist rivals.Analysts predict that the attempt to overthrow Erdogan could end up serving as a way for him to further consolidate authority. Erdogan for years has endeavored to exert control over the military, typically seen as a check on the executive, and to eradicate the Gulen Movement, which has gradually built up a presence in the Turkish police and judiciary force.Prime Minister Yildirim warned on Saturday that any state supporting Gulen will be at war with Turkey. The announcement puts pressure on the United States, where the cleric resides. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry invited Turkey to provide evidence of a connection between Gulen and the coup attempt, saying that American authorities would “make judgments” after reviewing such a case. Turkish authorities reportedly ordered 2,745 judges and prosecutors be detained, according to Turkish broadcaster NTV. Some Turks fear a mass crackdown is now inevitable, targeting anyone deemed a government opponent.Yet, despite stark polarization in Turkey, many political parties and individuals normally critical of Erdogan and the Turkish government came out in full force against the coup attempt.The same media outlets that Erdogan very recently tried to rein in put up intense resistance to the soldiers in the coup attempt, broadcasting the unfolding events live at great personal danger. And though Erdogan has often tried to block Turkish citizens from public protests, massive crowds of people welcomed him when he landed at the airport in Istanbul in the early morning hours.Emre Kizilkaya, a journalist for the Turkish daily newspaper Hurriyet, said that the mass outcry over the coup attempt, especially coming from people normally highly critical of the government, shows the “resilience of Turkish democracy.”He was at Hurriyet’s office when armed men barged in. “I tried to remain calm but it’s not easy when you have a first lieutenant raiding your office, sending his team, armed with machine guns, to bring everyone to the ground floor and [saying] ‘never hesitate to shoot,’” he said.Even the pro-Kurdish opposition party ― the People’s Democratic Party, or HDP ― came out against the coup attempt.“The only solution is democratic politics!” read a statement from Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ, the party co-chairs. “In [these] challenging and critical days which Turkey goes through, whatever its reason might be, no one should put himself in the place of the people’s will.”But Demirtaş also issued a firm warning, saying drastic measures need to be taken to quell the “politics of polarization” and violence within the country.“A progressive democracy does not appear by itself, just because the coup attempt was unsuccessful,” he said. In parts of the city, life went on as normal, with only hints of something amiss.In one store in Beyoglu, on the European side of the city, families calmly shopped for groceries as they do most days. But in the vegetable aisle, the usually full cases were empty, save for a few beat-up onions.On Istiklal Avenue, Istanbul’s most famous and heavily trafficked street, vendors sold Turkish flags to Turks and foreigners alike.And at a nearby coffee shop, young Turks sipped coffees in the afternoon heat, as if it was any other summer Saturday. But today, the coffee there was free.“Turkey is in a bad situation,” said 24-year-old Nuri, a barista, brewing a free cup of coffee for a customer. “We are all together.”“I am very worried,” he said, saying he woke up, in shock, to the booms of fighters jets passing in the night sky. “I am very sad and scared.”Karel Barbur contributed reporting."

Turkey is still reeling from terrorist attacks carried out by the self-described Islamic State and by Kurdish militants. Many Turks were out for blood after Erdogan, who said he dodged an assassination attempt on Friday, called on Turkish citizens to fill the streets in protest.One unverified video shared widely on social media appeared to show a lone police officer protecting a petrified soldier, accused of supporting the coup, from an angry mob. Other videos online appeared to show military tanks mowing down pro-government protesters.Violence peaked early Saturday morning. At one point, a fighter jet shot down a military helicopter reportedly flown by pro-coup forces that was attacking the parliament complex in Ankara while legislators hid in a parliamentary shelter. “It was frantic,” one employee of Istanbul’s Haydarpasa Numune Hospital, who asked not to be named, said of last night’s rush to save lives. “Still, there are wounded people who haven’t been able to get any treatment.”On Twitter, the hashtag #idamistiyorum, meaning “I want the death penalty,” went viral, with many demanding the ultimate punishment for those they deemed traitors.Yıldırım said Saturday that while Turkey’s constitution forbids the death penalty, the country will “consider legal changes” in light of the coup attempt. Early on Saturday, Erdogan described the failed overthrow as treason and pledged a harsh outcome for those behind it.“They will pay a heavy price for their treason to Turkey,” he said.Erdogan ― still a popular, although increasingly controversial political leader ― has long been attempting to shift more authority toward his office, and has pushed for a revised constitution that would establish an executive presidency in Turkey.Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) won majority rule in Turkey’s elections last November, reviving the prospect that the president would strengthen his grip on the country’s political landscape. Six months later, Erdogan ousted prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, evidently out of concern that his once-ally could place a check on his own power.Opposition politicians and analysts have viewed Erdogan’s aspirations to a U.S.-style executive presidency as a worrying sign of his increasingly authoritarian streak. In recent years, Erdogan has cracked down on dissent within Turkish media, built a lavish palace for himself and arrested Gulenist rivals.Analysts predict that the attempt to overthrow Erdogan could end up serving as a way for him to further consolidate authority. Erdogan for years has endeavored to exert control over the military, typically seen as a check on the executive, and to eradicate the Gulen Movement, which has gradually built up a presence in the Turkish police and judiciary force.Prime Minister Yildirim warned on Saturday that any state supporting Gulen will be at war with Turkey. The announcement puts pressure on the United States, where the cleric resides. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry invited Turkey to provide evidence of a connection between Gulen and the coup attempt, saying that American authorities would “make judgments” after reviewing such a case. Turkish authorities reportedly ordered 2,745 judges and prosecutors be detained, according to Turkish broadcaster NTV. Some Turks fear a mass crackdown is now inevitable, targeting anyone deemed a government opponent.Yet, despite stark polarization in Turkey, many political parties and individuals normally critical of Erdogan and the Turkish government came out in full force against the coup attempt.The same media outlets that Erdogan very recently tried to rein in put up intense resistance to the soldiers in the coup attempt, broadcasting the unfolding events live at great personal danger. And though Erdogan has often tried to block Turkish citizens from public protests, massive crowds of people welcomed him when he landed at the airport in Istanbul in the early morning hours.Emre Kizilkaya, a journalist for the Turkish daily newspaper Hurriyet, said that the mass outcry over the coup attempt, especially coming from people normally highly critical of the government, shows the “resilience of Turkish democracy.”He was at Hurriyet’s office when armed men barged in. “I tried to remain calm but it’s not easy when you have a first lieutenant raiding your office, sending his team, armed with machine guns, to bring everyone to the ground floor and [saying] ‘never hesitate to shoot,’” he said.Even the pro-Kurdish opposition party ― the People’s Democratic Party, or HDP ― came out against the coup attempt.“The only solution is democratic politics!” read a statement from Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ, the party co-chairs. “In [these] challenging and critical days which Turkey goes through, whatever its reason might be, no one should put himself in the place of the people’s will.”But Demirtaş also issued a firm warning, saying drastic measures need to be taken to quell the “politics of polarization” and violence within the country.“A progressive democracy does not appear by itself, just because the coup attempt was unsuccessful,” he said. In parts of the city, life went on as normal, with only hints of something amiss.In one store in Beyoglu, on the European side of the city, families calmly shopped for groceries as they do most days. But in the vegetable aisle, the usually full cases were empty, save for a few beat-up onions.On Istiklal Avenue, Istanbul’s most famous and heavily trafficked street, vendors sold Turkish flags to Turks and foreigners alike.And at a nearby coffee shop, young Turks sipped coffees in the afternoon heat, as if it was any other summer Saturday. But today, the coffee there was free.“Turkey is in a bad situation,” said 24-year-old Nuri, a barista, brewing a free cup of coffee for a customer. “We are all together.”“I am very worried,” he said, saying he woke up, in shock, to the booms of fighters jets passing in the night sky. “I am very sad and scared.”Karel Barbur contributed reporting."

But there was also an undeniable sense of uncertainty in a country already wracked by polarizing politics and terrorist attacks.“I congratulate all citizens who resisted the coup attempt,” Turkey’s Prime Minister, Binali Yildirim, said Saturday, insisting that the situation was “completely under control” after a night of shocking bloodshed.“Right now, we’re focused on catching the perpetrators and bringing them to justice,” he added.At least 265 people were dead as of Saturday afternoon, according to a Turkish government official, 104 of them described as “assailants.” Some 1,440 were left wounded and 2,839 detained. Turkey says the coup attempt was carried out by members and supporters of the Gulen Movement, a Sunni Muslim group led by Erdogan’s arch-rival, Fethullah Gulen, who currently lives in self-imposed exile on a compound in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. A Gulen-linked group called the Alliance for Shared Values has denied involvement in the coup attempt.
