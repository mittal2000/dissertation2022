0,WELLNESS,Diagnosing and Treating Fungal Meningitis,"Manoj Jain MD, Contributor
Manoj Jain, MD MPH is an infectious disease physician, a write...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meningitis_us_5b9c6593e4b03a1dcc7e56f1,"As the number of deaths from fungal meningitis mounts, many people want to know how fungal meningitis is diagnosed and treated.",2012-10-12,"This photo provided Oct. 9, 2012, by the Minnesota Department of Health shows shows vials of the injectable steroid product made by New England Compounding Center implicated in a fungal meningitis outbreak that were being shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta from Minneapolis. About 17,700 single-dose vials of the steroid sent to 23 states have been recalled. The outbreak involves 10 states, including Minnesota. (AP Photo/Minnesota Department of Health)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c65933c00005b0009be55.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the number of deaths from fungal meningitis mounts, many people want to know how fungal meningitis is diagnosed and treated. As an infectious disease doctor, it is routine for me to care for patients who come in the hospital with a fever. At first glance it is impossible to tell whether the patient has meningitis, pneumonia or a urine infection.If a patient has headache, confusion or stiff neck along with the fever then I become suspicious for meningitis. Meningitis is simply an infection of the sac and the sterile fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. From the clinical presentation, it is impossible to know which type of meningitis a patient has.One of the most common forms is bacterial meningitis, caused by the same organisms that lead to sinusitis or pneumonia. Viral meningitis is generally less severe and often occurs during the summer months. Tuberculous meningitis occurs often in the developing countries, and fungal meningitis is seen in patients who have a weakened immune system, such as those with cancer or AIDS. It is critically important to know the likely pathogens causing the meningitis because it determines the life-saving treatment regimen.Diagnosis of meningitis can only be made by a lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, where a trained physician places a thin needle in the lower back and draws a sample of fluid surrounding the spinal cord and the brain. If the spinal fluid has many white cells, it is an indication that there is inflammation, possibly due to an infection. If there is a predominance of white cells that are neutrophils, it is indicative of a bacterial meningitis. Other types of cells are suggestive of viral, fungal or TB infection.The definitive diagnosis of meningitis is made by examining the fluid under a microscope and obtaining a spinal fluid culture. Sometimes a culture may not readily grow a bacteria or a fungus, and so doctors must use clinical judgment and lab results to determine the likely causative agent and give the appropriate treatment. Public health official have determined that the recent outbreak of meningitis is Tennessee and other states is due to two fungi, aspergillus and exserohilum rostratum, which contaminated some of the 17,000 steroid vials used for injection. These fungi are commonly found in soil and plants. In my practice, while I often see patients who have had a heart or lung transplant with aspergillus infection in the lung, I have never seen a case of aspergillus meningitis, or an infection with the exserohilum rostartum. For the general public, it is important to know that these fungi don't naturally cause meningitis infections in patients with a normal immune system unless they have been exposed to the tainted injection in the spine. Also, while some types of bacterial meningitis -- like Neisseria meningitidis -- are contagious, most other forms of meningitis, including fungal meningitis, cannot be passes on from person to person.The treatment for fungal meningitis needs to be promptly started if patients have had a spinal injection and their spinal fluid is suggestive of fungal meningitis. The medicines include voriconazole and lipid amphotericin B. Each medicine has serious side affects, including kidney failure. And even with proper treatment, the prognosis of fungal meningitis is tenuous. So who should seek medical attention? Any patients who have had a steroid injection after May 21, 2012 and are having symptoms of meningitis or a stroke, as well as patients with back-bone infection or joint infection after steroid injections. Just today at the hospital we were consulted on a patient who had a steroid injection in the back.Many doctors, including myself, are going through a steep learning curve about the outbreak and better diagnosis and management of fungal meningitis. Likewise, many patients who have previously had any form of steroid injections are very anxious. Most certainly this outbreak of fungal meningitis will be contained, yet it is important for all of us to stay informed.For more by Manoj Jain, M.D., MPH, click here.For more healthy living health news, click here."

2,PARENTING,Effectively Parenting Teens: Leading by Example,"Sandra Dupont, Contributor
Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parenting-teens_us_5b9c6624e4b03a1dcc7e5c44,"During the teen years, it is vital that parents understand their teen's behavior rather than merely react to it.",2012-10-12,Teenage girl studying with textbooks looking unhappy,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c66242400003100532e89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The foundation of effective parenting is leading by example. When children observe how we treat them and others, they learn how to behave. A parent's interaction with their child literally impacts their child's brain development, and parenting styles can be passed down through generations. In our society, shaming is an accepted parenting tool for controlling kids. Many children hear shaming and humiliating messages all day long: comparisons with siblings or other kids, the mocking of their age and abilities or comments that just make them feel stupid or inferior. I would like to invite our society to relearn respect and civility, both of which start at home. As parents, we are responsible for modeling self-respect and respect for others. When we treat children with respect, they learn to treat themselves and others respectfully. Our body language, facial expressions, the tone and volume of our voice, threatening violence, withholding affection, rejecting behavior, using demeaning words or physical punishment definitely impact a child's self-esteem and can teach them aggressive behavior. The foundation of any respectful argument involves avoiding the following: raising your voice, swearing, name-calling and pointing your finger in the other person's face.Conscious parenting involves pausing before speaking or acting to evaluate whether our words or actions are necessary. (Will your words or actions truly help the situation?) Encouraging your child should never include a demeaning or threatening word, act, or deed, nor should it cause them to lose their dignity or self-respect. Instead, encouragement should provide a shift upward in their sense of self, guiding the child toward a path of hope, inspiration and possibility. When children act out, disobey, behave rudely or display disturbing emotions, it's easy to dismiss them or their behavior as ""bad"" or ""wrong""; however, as we go about redirecting and disciplining our children, it's helpful to see these behaviors as a child's best attempt to meet a need. It calls upon us to look at our relationship with our child, and find the source of their unmet need.When a child becomes a teen and begins forming a separate identity, the parental role changes. Parents must make the transition from providing for all their child's needs to coaching their teen to manage their own frustrations and needs. Although it may be challenging to cope with the willfulness, clinging or demands typical of this period, parents need to deal with expressed aggression and dependence in a straightforward, honest way that affirms the dignity and power of both parent and child. The parent who resents and cannot tolerate their teen choosing to defy them by expressing their autonomy and wanting to do things independently will make that child feel as though the price of their own freedom is abandonment and loss of love. Here are some thoughts why teens and parents have difficulty navigating the teen years, and suggestions for a more graceful passage:1. Teens feel conditionally loved: ""I'm OK only if I live up to your expectations."" 2. Parents don't allow teens to learn from failure, an excellent motivator.  3. Teens don't learn time management skills simply through the creation of ""daily routine"" charts.  4. Parents gift their children too many things and then wonder why teens are not only unappreciative, they also want more. 5. Teens don't learn problem-solving skills when parents lecture them. 6. Parents don't always know how to calmly and simply say, ""I love you, and the answer is no."" 7. Refrain from thinking that in order to make teens do better, you first have to make them feel worse. Instead, be kind and firm while holding them accountable. 8. Parents too often tell their teen what to do rather than inviting them to brainstorm solutions that that will work for everyone. 9. Parents expect teens to ""remember to do their chores"" as though it were an indicator of responsibility. Yet not all responsible adults were responsible teens.  10. Parents are often more interested in short-term results than long-term results. For example: I'll force you to do your homework now even if it means you will not do your best because you are rebelling. 11. Parents nag, which invites resistance. Instead, allow teens to explore for themselves the relevance of what you want them to do.During the teen years, it is vital that parents understand their teen's behavior rather than merely react to it. Being a ""drill sergeant"" or a ""helicopter parent"" gives teens the message that you don't trust them to do things on their own and undermines their self-esteem, which prevents them from developing confidence in their own abilities. Successfully navigating this phase of life involves setting boundaries and enforcing consequences without becoming punitive, angry, or judgmental. Respectful parenting means being able to see the frustrations teens encounter when pushing against imposed boundaries as opportunities for them to exercise self-control, self-respect and respect for others.It has be said that: ""While not all teachers are parents, all parents are teachers."" Good character traits like empathy and respect are teachable skills that must be learned at home and at school. When we teach children to be good people we help create a world that is safer, kinder and more equitable."

HBCF is a charity based in Fremont, Calif. that was formed in 1998 to ""support all women healing from breast cancer by providing post-surgical products and services regardless of financial status."" Those fit, 20-something men are Neil Walsky, 25, and Jesse Frechione, 23, both of Anchorage, Alaska. In ""The Bicycle Diaries,"" I profiled Neil and Jesse, their mission and their motivation. Among other things, I noted that Neil and Jesse are biking specifically in honor of Neil's mom, who was successfully treated for breast cancer in 2011, but that they also are biking in support of the HBCF, which helped Neil's mom when she was struggling with the after-effects of her treatment. More than a month into their ride, and in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, I am providing an update on their journey:At 5 a.m. on Aug. 23, 2012, Neil and Jesse bid their families goodbye in the chilly rain of Anchorage, Alaska to no fanfare other than Jesse's repeatedly tipping over as he struggled to acclimate to his brand new clip-in-pedals (note to would-be bikers: do not try out new gear on the day you set off to ride 7,000 miles). Within the next six hours, Jesse was hit by a car (sustaining no serious injuries) and blew out a tire. Notwithstanding such inauspicious beginnings, our young heroes went on to cover more than 200 miles in over the next 48 hours and close to 2,000 miles before making it to San Francisco four weeks later.As Neil and Jesse wound their way from Anchorage through Canada's Yukon Territory, then back through Haines, Alaska and onto the ""Lower 48"" via Bellingham, Wash., they covered more miles in a matter of days than they had ridden in their entire lives. As they struggled to find their ""bike legs,"" they became closely acquainted with ibuprofen and developed the sort of routine that perhaps only another 20-something man might be able to follow:Each riding day (roughly five out of seven), they would begin with a lumberjack's breakfast of eggs, pancakes, peanut butter, and hot coffee. They would then ride the nearly empty highways for 30 to 40 miles before stopping at whatever roadside stand they happened upon for a hearty lunch of burgers and more hot coffee. After lunch, they would ride another 40 to 50 miles until they found a diner or convenience store to purchase food for supper. As Neil and Jesse approached the Canadian border from Alaska, they met up with Neil's mom and biked with her for about 150 miles; Jesse's mom joined them as well, driving alongside of them in her car. Shortly thereafter, Neil and Jesse made friends with a lone bike rider from the United Kingdom and rode with him for the rest of the Yukon leg of their trip until they reached the ferry back to Alaska.Throughout Alaska and the Yukon Territory, Neil and Jesse slept outside, despite sub-freezing nighttime temperatures. On the bright side, the days were largely sunny, there were no run-ins with grizzlies, and they found that their planned route was workable. Unfortunately, when Neil and Jesse reached Washington State, they discovered that their planned route needed serious tweaking: The Interstate 5 did not allow bike riders. As a result, throughout Washington and much of Oregon, Neil and Jesse often found themselves biking mountain routes on dirt and gravel, at least until they arrived in Portland, at which point they made their way to the coast, toasting their discovery thereof with shots of Jaegermeister, which is not unusual for a couple of 20-something guys.Also not unusual for a couple of 20-something guys? Getting a surprise visit from a friend who wants to join in the adventure. Once in Portland, Neil and Jesse got a surprise visit from their friend, Mike Price, 26. Mike had grown up playing hockey with Neil and works as an engineer in the gas and oil industry. Upon finding himself in between gigs, Mike spontaneously decided to take the red eye from Alaska. Once in Portland, Mike purchased a bike at REI and joined Neil and Jesse for an 80-mile day. Hooked by the adrenaline and his friends' enthusiasm, and inspired by his own grandmother's having recently marked 33 years as a breast cancer survivor, Mike decided to soldier on through to San Francisco. He made it to Santa Cruz (approximately 900 miles of riding altogether) before he got called back to work. He is back in Anchorage now as Neil and Jesse continue their travels.Along Neil and Jesse's travels, even as they biked through the wilderness, they were never far from reminders of why they were doing what they were doing: Signposts of breast cancer seemed to pop up at the most unexpected of times. At one point, Neil and Jesse gave chase to a mugger who had made off with a woman's iPhone. They couldn't catch the guy, but it turned out that the woman was a breast cancer survivor. Outside of an old abandoned mining town on the Alaska Highway (Silver City), Neil and Jesse found themselves in the dark of night without a safe place to sleep when they came upon the Kluane Bed and Breakfast... only to find that it was closed. The proprietors were kind enough to allow Neil and Jesse to camp on the property, and in the morning brought breakfast to Neil and Jesse. It turned out that the Kluane was closed due to a death in the family... due to cancer. Upon learning that Neil and Jesse were riding to raise money for the HERS Breast Cancer Foundation, the family made a generous donation.On Sept. 29, Neil and Jesse were in Fremont, Calif. to attend the HERS Breast Cancer Foundation Annual KEEP ABREAST 5k walk and 5k/10k run. They participated in the 5k walk and were hosted in a manner fit for kings by the woman who handles the HBCF website: Neil and Jesse stayed with Lisa Stambaugh and her husband while they were in the San Francisco area. Meeting their ""honorary moms"" at the HBCF and being presented with their HBCF jerseys was arguably the highlight of this leg of their trip.Throughout October, Neil and Jesse will be traveling down the California coast. So far, their California leg has been marked by the open arms of welcoming hosts, the comfort of beautiful surroundings (check their Facebook page for the amazing photos) and delicious food and drink: In the Napa Valley, they paid a visit to the St. Helena winery, but they also found that the milkshakes there were memorable. In Geyserville, it was the pizza was memorable. In Calistoga, it was the barbeque. When they cross the border into Mexico and make their way through Central America and South America, things promise to get a bit less comfortable since neither of them speaks Spanish (although they are planning to meet up, and ride with, Isaac Bean, 29, Neil's cousin, who is fluent in Spanish).Stay tuned for more updates here, on Neil and Jesse's Cycling South: Alaska to South America website and on their Facebook page.You can follow Neil and Jesse's progress by clicking on this link, which tracks Neil and Jesse's progress via satellite (cool!).To Sponsor the Cyclists, click on this this link.To hear Neil tell of his reasons for making the trip, check out this short video.

Chief Executive Ron Johnson wrote in the e-mail sent to customers early on Thursday.Sales slid disastrously in the months after the changes began and the company already warned investors it will be a tough holiday season. Penney has since made some tweaks such as rearranging its displays of merchandise to make clear exactly which items are on clearance.The problem, according to analysts, is that customer traffic has fallen as shoppers seem to lack a clear reason to come into Penney's stores in the absence of discounts and coupons.Johnson's email, which says one of Penney's core values is that a shopper should not have to wait for a sale or coupon to get a great value, includes a $10 ""gift"" to thank patrons for their loyalty. It can be used for an in-store purchase until November 4.""Why do that unless you want to drive traffic?"" Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand told Reuters. ""It's another sign they're having trouble weaning customers off of the old ways of shopping.""Despite early signs of success and some positive signs during the back-to-school shopping period, early September was ""much tougher"" than expected, Johnson told Wall Street analysts in September.Penney shares were up 7.7 percent at $26.02 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; editing by Matthew Lewis)"
