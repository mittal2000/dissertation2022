""Gaomi is no longer what it was,"" poet Li Danping told Xinhua. ""It is now the holy land of the country, Mecca of Chinese literature.""At the center of the plan is a scheme to attract visitors by planting a large crop of red sorghum. This grain is of particular significance to Mo Yan's career: “Red Sorghum,"" one of the author's best-known works, was the basis for an award winning film. He is said to have lamented the loss of the crop, which local farmers abandoned because of its low profit margin.“The plan is high-risk as sorghum itself can hardly develop into a profitable industry,” Fan Wei, director of the local committee, told the paper. “But we expect the government to approve this plan as great investment can bring big development.”According to the Financial Times, Fan Wei also told the author's father that he needed to refurbish the family home because ""the house and the son were no longer his alone but belonged to Chinese society now."" Recently, Chinese officials also sought to drive domestic tourism in the country by opening an atomic bomb test facility. "

Citing disillusionment with the ability of the system to serve the needs of the poor Black community, and in the wake of the latest government housing scandal, the shanty town was built.

And while middle-class families struggle more than ever to pay for these basic costs, they are falling further behind economically, the report warns. When it comes to the most expensive cities, forget San Francisco and New York. The study compared local housing and transportation costs to the median income and found that the middle-class is taking the biggest hit in cities in Florida and Southern California where the median income is low and costs for housing and transportation remain high.The report showed that Miami is the most expensive city for middle-class families, where 72 percent of household income goes to cover basic housing and transportation. Other cities in the top five include Riverside, Calif., (69 percent); Tampa (66 percent), Los Angeles (65 percent); and San Diego (63 percent). These cities ranked higher than more expensive cities because costs are much higher than the local median income.Washington, D.C. has the the lowest cost burden for middle-class families with just 51 percent going toward housing and transportation. Other cities with the lowest cost-burden include Philadelphia (52 percent); Baltimore (53 percent); Minneapolis (54 percent); and Boston (54 percent).High costs of housing and transportation leave families no money left over to pay for other basic necessities like food, education, and health care, let alone savings. With rising food costs and higher taxes right around the corner, things are only going to get worse.In the 25 biggest cities in the United States, residents saw their costs for housing and transportation jump by 44 percent over the last decade. Unfortunately, income didn't rise quite as fast with paychecks only growing a modest 25 percent during the same stretch of time, the report said.  "

Everything seemed so big: the cars, the streets, the food portions, as well as the enormous drive for consumption. I loved every minute of my new life in America! The frantic pace of the big city fit me like a glove. I came ready to start a successful career and plunged head first into the frenzied pursuit of the American Dream. Thirty years later, the dream has become an illusion and the chimeric pursuit of happiness by achieving great success through hard work revealed itself as a sort of fool's paradise, keeping me spinning on the rat's wheel to nowhere. I asked myself: Is the pursuit of the American Dream still worth it, or does it actually lead us to a profound disconnect from our higher values and a surreptitious shut down of our hearts?The fact is America provides opportunities that no other country can, but at what price? Politicians are asking us whether we're better off today than we were four years ago. I'd like us to ask ourselves if our quality of life and our level of fulfillment are as good as we had hoped it would be, or if instead we are letting ourselves be ruled by greed vs. goodness and compassion toward others. This national relentless drive toward material gains didn't come without major sacrifices. Don't get me wrong, I'll be the first one to admit that I enjoy life's comforts and that financial security can provide us with the freedom to pursue other interests and activities. However, when the pursuit of materialism isn't balanced with an equally strong drive to connect with our inner source of power (where true peace and happiness are found), we lose our passion for life, our hearts shut down, and life is lived halfway. By putting relentless emphasis on material gain at the expense of a more holistic lifestyle, we compromise our right to freedom and happiness on every level. This is what perpetuates the unease we feel inside, the emptiness we then desperately try to fill. Yes, we can have the nice house with the white picket fence, but we still have to face our lack of contentment.  This overachievement syndrome is clearly being reflected in our personal lives as well as in the state of our society. When is the house big enough, the bank account cushy enough, the car flashy enough for us to be satisfied and to connect on a deeper level with each other? Similarly, when are the companies' profits large enough, the country's reach and control widespread enough before we can effectively give a hand to the less fortunate ones amongst us? Awareness of others' plight, compassion toward our brothers and sisters, and willingness to understand and connect with our fellow human beings, have been replaced by a fierce attitude of self-protectionism and isolationism (what's mine is mine, stay away from it and to hell with others!) that breeds fear and feeds right into the hands of politicians who want to appear as knights in shining armor ready to protect everything we've accumulated!The consequences of our greed are serious, but thankfully they are reversible. Excess and selfishness can't be sustained without major negative repercussions. As a country, we are globally losing traction in many areas including education, health care, and quality of our food supply. As individuals, we are losing sight of what really matters most: living a life that fulfills our material wants as well as our emotional and spiritual needs. Sometimes, we're kicked off the rat's wheel by a difficult circumstance that demands us to realign our priorities. In my case, I needed the swift and penetrating blow of a life-threatening health diagnosis to jar me out of complacency and back on a more meaningful path. I had to curb my excesses and to become aware of what was really important for me: a meaningful and loving relationship with my children, becoming more community-minded, and opening my heart to others. My American Dream didn't turn out the way I thought it would. I had the big house, the big car, the successful husband and the two children, but I was unfulfilled and still had all my issues to deal with! I dug my head in the sand as long as I could, I admit it, until the desire for freedom became stronger than my fear of change. Only by working on the inner as well as the outer paths did I reach a sustainable level of peace and happiness.  So next time a politician solicits our vote, let's ask ourselves what his message mirrors in our own lives. Is his American Dream really ours? Let's use the opportunity as a reality check on our own state of affairs. If we are truly living in the land of the free, then let's exercise the right to vote for the candidate who represents the highest values we strive for instead of the values that perpetuate greed and lack of social compassion. Let's vote with our entire being, without caving into our fears or past conditioning. The American Dream has been permanently altered. It's time to reinvent it to reflect a more conscious state of living that encourages personal as well as collective growth.For more by Toni Emerson, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here.

For many, that means the scary season has officially begun. I'm not referring to kids who can't wait for Halloween with all of its spooky excitement. I'm talking about newly separated grown-ups who dread facing their first set of holidays as a single parent.In the immediate wake of a divorce, it's hard enough to just get through each day. The extra pressure to conjure up a warm and fuzzy holiday season for your kids is enough to turn even the fairest of us all into a wicked witch. In fact, having anything close to resembling happy holidays in your current emotional state seems as impossible as getting a good night's sleep. (If only your kid's Harry Potter costume came with some magic potions.) And it's not like getting through Halloween is all you have to worry about. The one-two punch of Thanksgiving and Christmas will clobber you faster than you can gobble up all of the good candy out of your kids' Halloween haul. (Hey -- with all of the pounds you've dropped on the Divorce Diet, you can eat bags of bite sized Snickers and still go as a skeleton for Halloween.)As much as you may want to, you can't hide behind an invisibility cloak until the holiday season disappears. And now might be a good time to point out that there is something even more depressing than trying to figure out how to create happy memories for your kids when you've never been more miserable -- and that's facing your first holidays without them.But don't worry. I've been exactly where you are now. And I have some tips to help you get through this.  1. They're the reason for the season. As scary and unsettling as your divorce is to you, it is even more so to your kids. You at least have some say in steering the direction of the crazy train. Your kids, on the other hand, are completely powerless over the decisions being made by you and your ex -- decisions that have a very real impact on their lives. Simply put, they are riding shotgun on the most terrifying trip of their lives. Because you're the parent, it's up to you to do your best to protect your kids' childhood and to provide a stable and loving home for them while they are with you. So, in case you're trying to figure out how you can get a hall pass on this holiday season, forget about it. Your kids need you to pull it together for them. Getting the holidays off the ground will help them understand that life goes on after divorce and send them the signal that a new sense of normal will emerge. And that's a message they really need right now.2. You get a present, too! The primary reason you're going to do your best to have a decent holiday season is for your kids. But you'll get something for your efforts in return. Having a project to dig into right now can be therapeutic. It will help pass the time in a constructive way and give you something to focus on other than your divorce. By showing your kids that things will eventually be okay, you'll also be internalizing that message yourself.3. Keep it Simple, Santa. There's a difference between celebrating and competing. The idea is to maintain the practice of celebrating holidays, not to outdo your ex. When you make the holidays into a competition, you reduce it to a popularity pageant where you and your ex compete for the kids' votes. And nothing feels more hollow than that. By keeping things simple, you'll avoid biting off more than you can chew. Plus, you'll demonstrate respect for the fact that the family is working through a major transition rather than trying to fake that things have never been better.Things will get better -- but that comes with time. 4. Think through your holiday rituals. Sort through your family's traditions and decide which ones to keep, which ones to modify and which ones to scrap.For example, say your home is the ""go-to"" spot in the neighborhood each year on Halloween because of the Camp Carnage haunted house you hold in a tent in your front yard. If you're the one with the camping gear and enthusiasm for the project, chances are you and your kids can continue this tradition, no problem. But if your ex was the one that starred in the crucial and terrifying role of the Angry Hunter who accosts the tent when everyone least expects it (a role that came a little too naturally, now that you look back on everything), you'll need to decide whether to modify the tradition or scrap it all together. If you have an awesome sibling (and note that I said sibling, not new love interest) who's game to help out, Camp Carnage might continue to terrify trick or treaters without missing a beat. But if you think that the project will remind everyone that your ex is gone rather than reassure everyone that life goes on, you might want to skip the whole thing and instead go to the haunted house at your church's Halloween carnival. Then, next year you can decide if you want to reprise the tradition with some modifications. Maybe instead of the Angry Hunter, your haunted house could feature an equally terrifying Bitter Divorced Person brandishing a stack of unpaid bills and a bottle of gin. (But playing that role would require real acting ability since you will never ever let yourself become that character in real life. Do you hear me?)By thinking through and reworking your holiday customs, you will minimize the chances that your holiday season will be a long and painful reminder of your divorce, and instead create a blend of traditions that pay homage to your family's past as well as light a path to your future.   5. For the holidays, your sleigh is flying solo. Once I became a parent, with the possible exception of New Year's Eve, every holiday became defined by kid-centric activities. So there was nothing quite as gruesome as trying to get through my first Halloween without my little monster. But divorce requires dividing up the holidays so that kids can have time with each parent, and that means spending some holidays without them. There's no one to blame for this; it's just the way the math works out. But that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you and your ex are on decent terms, you might be able to work it out so that each parent has some time with the kids on the big day. And some grown-ups with superpowers are able to actually celebrate together. But for the rest of us mere mortals, here are some tips for making it through the holidays when you don't have your kids. First, just because your kids aren't with you on the actual day doesn't mean you can't celebrate.The trick is to make it more about the entire season and less about one single day. So, go ahead and get the box out of the attic and decorate your house. Then, in the weeks leading up to the holiday, get busy with holiday activities at home. Carve a Jack-o'-lantern. Bake Christmas cookies. Make homemade ornaments. Go caroling. Next, take advantage of events in your community that are scheduled for days that your kids are with you. Go to the fall festival at your kids' school. Volunteer together at your local food bank's Thanksgiving food drive. Sign everyone up for the Jingle Bell 5K fun run. Visit your church's live nativity. When all is said and done, you and your kids will come away with a horn of plenty of seasonal memories even if you aren't together on the day itself.And when the day does roll around, don't sit around your empty house surrounded by everything that reminds you of the fact that your kids are gone and you're all alone. Go to a Halloween party -- and I'm talking about one for grown-ups, not one for kids. Book a spa weekend over Thanksgiving. Go spend Christmas with a friend who lives out of town. In other words, do something different from what you would normally do. The first holidays you spend without your kids will pass more quickly and with fewer tears if you spend it doing something completely out of the ordinary. And in future years, don't be surprised if you find that it's kind of nice to get a little breather now and then. The holidays that you spend without your kids can provide an opportunity for you to rest and recharge. That way, when you do have your kids for the holidays, you'll be refreshed and ready to make their spirits bright again."

I know you really want the Cheerios and you want to show off your choppers, but don't bite my arm as I put them on your plate.",2012-10-19,"Actor Joaquin Phoenix arrives for the premiere of the film 'The Master' at the 69th edition of the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy, Saturday, Sept. 1, 2012. (AP Photo/Joel Ryan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6d4d2500003300360f98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I tell my kids all the time to practice random acts of kindness. You never know how you can change another person's mood by just being nice. Believe me, this is foreign to many adults (Um, how about the ones zooming through the stop sign as I try to cross the street with my brood?). There is another equally important lesson and that is this: Never bite the hand that feeds you. When the kids were little, the meaning was in fact quite literal. I know you really want the Cheerios and you want to show off your choppers, but don't bite my arm as I put them on your plate. Now that they are older and less inclined to grit their teeth when I serve them their meals, this phrase has begun much more figurative. If you want people to be nice to you, it's best to practice kindness back.I have a son that is just crazy about math. He lives for extra work and math equations. I SO can't take credit for that one. He asked his teacher for after school enrichment, and she explained that she would look for things that are specific to his needs. Instead of waiting though, my son began writing in very small letters ""this is stupid"" on his homework. Silly, silly boy. Don't you know that I help organize the homework for your teacher? Guess who saw the oh-so-thoughtful comment? Your mom. Busted indeed.I used his homework graffiti as the perfect opportunity to reinforce both the importance of kindness and the whole not biting thing. I asked him ""why would your teacher want to help you if you're not showing respect or patience? Believe me, if you want to win people over, do it with kindness.""We watched the debates together. He was impressed with Obama's composure and noticed that Romney ""gets angry"" at Candy. Ahh... the hand! Candy is the moderator. What sense does it make to annoy her. Kid is NINE and he gets it.You know who else needs to learn a lesson or two? Joaquin Phoenix. He is amazing in The Master, certainly Oscar-worthy. But when you snub your nose at the organization that feeds you (quite literally, in this case, the industry provides him with the ability to put food on the table), you're not being cool. In fact, you're being an ass.When asked why he is not attending press junkets by Elvis Mitchell, Mr. Phoenix provided these words of wisdom: I'm just saying that I think it's bullshit. I think it's total, utter bullshit, and I don't want to be a part of it. I don't believe in it. It's a carrot, but it's the worst-tasting carrot I've ever tasted in my whole life. I don't want this carrot. It's totally subjective. Pitting people against each other... It's the stupidest thing in the whole world... It was one of the most uncomfortable periods of my life when Walk the Line was going through all the awards stuff and all that. I never want to have that experience again. I don't know how to explain it -- and it's not like I'm in this place where I think I'm just above it -- but I just don't ever want to get comfortable with that part of things.Is this really any different than my 9-year-old writing ""this is stupid"" on his homework? Nope. It most certainly isn't. Part of your obligation as an actor is to all of the people who helped promote you from the beginning. The Master relies on you to help raise awareness of the flick for things like box office tickets and industry recognition. You would be nothing without all of the people that hold you up when you're down, nominate you, take pictures of you and keep you on the forefront of people's minds. The only thing stupid here, Mr. Pheonix, is you. But calling you stupid wouldn't be kind, so I'm going to call your bluff. You want the carrot. I know you do."

I wanted to get back to my hotel room in New Brunswick, N.J. to watch the third game of the ALCS and second debate game. Since I'm an expert in television watching, I knew it would be a breeze to switch back between the games and not miss one significant detail. If you follow baseball, you know A-Rod has been striking out frequently, and in his other at-bats has performed miserably, perhaps a bit worse than Obama did in the first debate game. The president might not have struck out, but certainly did no more than scrape out a weak single or two. Neither of these two gave their fans what they wanted so both heard the boos and lots of negative criticism -- a lot of mine included. Tonight, during game three of the ALCS and the second debate game, each would have the chance to redeem themselves. I was hoping both would and was also wondering who would do better, A-Rod or Obama? Like the lady, or the tiger? We will never know. A-Rod had given such a poor performance, he was taken out of the game; he was benched. Obama, however, did have a chance to play. Whether he performed well is a matter of opinion highly influenced by your political alliances. For me, I thought Obama had some big hits and that he played well under pressure.Before I went to bed, my thoughts turned to the presentation I was going to give the next morning to Robert Wood Johnson Children's Hospital on the subject of giving and taking criticism. Robert Wood Johnson Children's Hospital is one of the most preeminent hospitals in the country, so I thought it an honor when I was invited to speak to 150 of their top department managers and share my expertise on positive criticism, a subject that I have been continually studying and learning about for 30 years. I was excited and curious about what I would learn from their questions, comments, examples, and experiences concerning giving and taking criticism.My presentation was over at noon, and since I live in Westport, Conn., I had about a two-hour drive to get home. I didn't mind; I'd use the drive time to reflect upon the presentation I just gave and to listen to ESPN radio, where I knew I would hear more criticism about A-Rod's performance, the rationale for benching him. As soon as I got on the New Jersey Turnpike and my route turned straight, I started to mentally multitask: A-Rod, presentation comments, questions, examples, Obama performance, and criticism. Each of these thought streams merged with each other.The thought that emerged applies to A-Rod, Obama, many of the managers at RWJ Children's Hospital, and to most people. Many times, we give criticism to others because they are not giving us what we want, and what we want is a function of totally unrealistic expectations.   Yankee fans want A-Rod to hit home runs, but the fact is, he is far from his prime and is no longer one of the game's best. We have unrealistic expectations about his performance, and it is a well-known psychological fact that when expectations are not met, a frequent response his anger. In this case, we get angry at A-Rod whereas we should be readjusting our expectations to the fact that there is little chance that A-Rod will perform like the superstar we want him to be.We give Obama a lot of negative criticism and anger about his performance concerning the economy. We all want the economy to improve at a much faster rate. When it doesn't we get angry and criticize Obama for not delivering on his promise. However, just as our expectations are unrealistic for A-Rod, perhaps our expectations for Obama's economic performance are also unrealistic. Just because he wants to improve the economy quickly and just because we want him to succeed in this area, that does not mean we are being realistic. In fact, if you step back and think about all the factors that impact the economy, and where the economy was four years ago, I think you'd have to be a fool to think that the economy could currently being doing much better. The majority of us are operating on unrealistic economic expectations. We all want to continue our spending habits, make more money, and our investments to have a greater pay-off. If this applies to you, you are, for the next few years, being unrealistic -- regardless of who is president.Instead of blaming Obama with our criticisms, we -- and the country -- would probably be better off if we readjusted our expectations to current reality. Cutting back on our own spending -- something most of us do not want to do -- would be a good start. After all, it's not the president's fault that most people max out on their credit cards because of eating out. I wanted a Porsche, but I'll have to settle for an Audi 6 -- it's a big difference.So, my message to Yankee fans -- be realistic when it comes to A-Rod and you will find yourself feeling less anger when you watch him play.Voters: Before you go to the polls, reassess your expectations and when you realize they are unrealistic, I think you will realize the president has performed well and you may want to extend his contract.For everybody else, make sure your criticisms are based on realistic expectations. If they are, you increase your chances that you will increase the likelihood that your criticism will be helpful.www.drhankw.comFor more by Dr. Hendrie Weisinger, click here.For more on emotional intelligence, click here."

It's not enough, the new documentary Happy suggests, to just be able to pursue happiness -- you need to have the chops to capture it.As part of Gaiam TV's ""Happiness Collection,"" Director Roko Belic tells the story of happiness from all angles, including into his artful mashup snippets from scientists, spiritual leaders, positivity psychologists, and arguably the most compelling, ordinary people grappling with their own lot in life. In their heartfelt narratives, they explore how their own lives prove fertile ground to test, and revise, definitions of happiness.Belic did his due diligence in terms of research. In collecting over 400 hours of footage from all over the world, ranging from a surfer hotspot in Brazil, the slums of India, cohousing in Denmark, the frenetic pace of industrial Japan, to the insulated world of Bhutan, Belic's film carries a convincing breadth and depth.This is not the mere woo-woo stuff of affirmation, but a moving explanation of how to nurture our own capacity to be happy. The film begins by introducing the notion that our happiness stems from a mash-up of genetics, life circumstances, and plenty of wiggle room. That substantial slice of our ration suggests we are inherently equipped to choose happiness, not just wish for it.Here are four tips from the film to develop a happiness skill set. And while results may vary, watch for these telltale signs to make sure you are on the right track: absorption, a sense of something budding in your chest, and an increased interest in cooperation.Practice Random Acts of KindnessOne of the film's main takeaways is to get off the ""hedonistic treadmill"" of material desires, and onto the more solid footing of cooperation and service. Extend kindness in ever-widening circles and notice how it often comes back, twofold. Claim Your CommunityAll your relations, family, friends, coworkers, neighbors and community have a huge impact on your happiness. Prioritizing these relationships and devoting time for social bonding lie at the essence of our humanity. A healthy sense of community and a caring social network may be one of the best indicators of happiness.Find Your Fulfillment Lose yourself in some absorbing activity, such as gardening, dancing, music, or whatever your vocation; this ability can offer you a sense of complete fulfillment.Appreciation, Appreciation, AppreciationMoney buys happiness, right? Wrong. The film conveys that true happiness stems from genuine gratitude for all that you do have, and a willingness to express that appreciation. Counting your blessing is a great way to shift the focus from what you don't have to what you do.Be sure to catch Roko Belic's latest documentary film, Happy, on GaiamTV.com!For more by GAIAM TV, click here.For more on happiness, click here."

9,DIVORCE,Why Does My Husband's Ex-Wife Hate Me?,"Jenna Korf, Contributor
Certified stepfamily coach and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-does-my-exhusbands-wi_us_5b9c6a41e4b03a1dcc7e7719,Here is a list of the most common reasons your husband's ex might not think too fondly of you.,2012-10-19,Woman with hands against cheeks against blue background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6a411f00005000213586.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Janine from Santa Ana, California asks: ""Why does my husband's ex-wife hate me? I've never done anything to her.""Well, Janine, you're in good company. Many other stepmoms are also perplexed by this. Here is a list of the most common reasons your husband's ex might not think too fondly of you.  1. She doesn't hate you, she hates what you represent: The failure of her marriage, the breakup of her family, the woman her ex-husband became a better man for, the fear that she might have ruined her child's life by not being able to make the marriage work.2. She's afraid her kids will love you more than they love her. An irrational fear, as the chances of that happening are basically nil, but a common fear nonetheless.3. She perceives you as overstepping boundaries. This could include showing up at a parent-teacher conference, forcing the kids to call you mom (yes, that does actually happen), calling the kids ""mine,"" posting pictures of the kids on your Facebook page, trying to co-parent with her by responding to messages sent to your husband, etc.4. She resents your participation in events she believes are reserved for ""mom"" and those that may not be reserved for mom but that are ""firsts."" These might include taking your stepdaughter to buy her first bra or getting her first haircut, participating in any sort of cosmetic experience, talking to her about the birds and the bees, painting her nails or coloring or cutting her hair the way you like it or similar to yours (even if your step is a teen and she requests this, it could still push mom's buttons). You can be sure that mom wants to be there for any sort of milestone.5. She has unresolved grief about her divorce. For a long time, she could just ignore the painful feelings that accompany divorce. She didn't really have to face it. She may even be remarried but never actually grieved the loss of her marriage and family. Enter stepmom, and suddenly it's real and it's in her face.6. You act as a mirror for her. When she looks at your strengths, all she sees are her weaknesses. If she never thought she was a good business woman and you own your own business, that insecurity is magnified. Same could be said for your intelligence, physical appearance, age, housekeeping skills, creativity, fashion sense, how much her kids enjoy being around you and your happy marriage.7. She perceives you as doing all the parenting while dad is ""let off the hook."" Stepmoms often help their husbands out with household duties and life in general. That's what a marriage is all about: partnership. You shuttle the kids back and forth to school or help with homework, you schedule appointments, etc. Often this has to do with gender roles, but all mom sees is that at her house, she's doing all the work while at yours, you're taking care of the kids and dad ""does nothing but works.""8. Now that you've come along, dad is asking for more parenting time. With your support, your husband may now see that he should exercise his visitation more or that he's now able to provide more stability for his kids. In turn, he requests more parenting time and parental input. You'd think this would be a good thing, but this change in dynamic can be threatening or scary for mom. Not everyone likes change. It's easy for her to pinpoint your presence as being responsible for this.9. She doesn't know you. When mom sends her kids off to be with their dad, and this woman she doesn't even know will have full access to them, she may feel like she's being a bad parent. She doesn't automatically trust you just because dad does. But at the same time, she doesn't necessarily want to meet you. A no-win situation for all involved.10. She sees her ex-husband being a different man with you. It can be painful to see the man you think treated you so poorly treating another woman like a princess. She might think he's being a fraud, or she might think, ""Why wasn't I worthy of being treated like that?"" She might still be grieving the loss of her marriage while he's moved on. It's nearly impossible for her to have good feelings toward you when she's still processing -- or in denial of -- the loss of her family.11. You actually did something worthy of her negative feelings. Are you consciously or subconsciously trying to make her look like a bad mom? Are you trying to prove to your husband that you're a better wife than she was? Are you trying to make your stepkids love you more than they love her? Do you try to show her up in any way? Do you want the school faculty, PTA or your neighborhood moms to think you're a better caretaker than she is? Take a look at your behavior and your motivations. You're going to have to be honest with yourself to see how you might be contributing to the high-conflict dynamic.Did I miss one?

10,WELLNESS,Bed Bug Habits Revealed In New Study,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bed-bug-habits-feeding-humans-blood-bedbug_us_5b9c6ecae4b03a1dcc7e967b,Researchers also found that production of bed bug eggs is linked with how much blood the bed bugs were able to consume the,2012-10-19,"SAN FRANCISCO - APRIL 30: Dead bed bugs lay on a paper towel April 30, 2009 in San Francisco, California. Cases of bed bug infestations are on the rise across the U.S. with many people bringing them into their homes after visiting hotels and airports. Bed bugs feed off of human blood. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6eca24000032005331c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new study examines the feeding patterns of bed bugs -- and the impact they can have on humans' blood after several months. The study, conducted by University of Florida researchers and published the journal Medical and Veterinary Entomology, shows that bed bugs will have a bigger or a smaller bloodmeal depending on when they last fed. For example, if bedbugs are fed every day, they have 1.5 times fewer instances of eating than those only fed occasionally, researchers found.Researchers also found that production of bed bug eggs is linked with how much blood the bed bugs were able to consume the week prior. ""Longer and more frequent feedings increased egg production, which would allow a faster growth of bed bug populations,"" they wrote in the study. ""The increase in bed bug populations obtained with more frequent and longer feedings can be the difference between a population that barely survives at a location and a thriving population."" Researchers conducted their study by letting bed bugs feed on chickens (both chickens and humans are known to be great ""feeding hosts"" for bed bugs). Bed bugs may be psychologically threatening and cause extremely irritating, scratchy bites -- but they aren't dangerous in the sense that they don't transmit disease. But in their simulations, the researchers noted that the potential blood loss associated with being fed on by bed bugs may not be good for health.""Our simulations suggest that uncontrolled populations of bed bugs can reach harmful levels for infant and adult humans in 3–8 months,"" they wrote in the study. ""Considering the blood supply available from humans, and the amount of time this host spends sleeping and available for bed bug feeding, it is obvious that bed bug populations in human-occupied facilities have the potential to grow extremely fast."" Again, bed bugs don't spread disease. But Scientific American previously reported that some people may be allergic to bed bug bites, and that itching bed bug bites can sometimes lead to infection:As far as the research shows, they don't transmit diseases, but they do bite and take blood. People can get secondary infections if they scratch their wounds. In some people, the itching is unbearable. There's some disagreement as to how many people don't itch at all. That's one reason why infestations can be so bad, because people don't realize they have them.Also, there have been reports of people being sickened from using pesticides to get rid of bed bugs, the New York Times reported last year. ""People lose their minds and, yeah, they'll do a lot of things trying to get rid of them,"" Dini M. Miller, an associate professor of urban pest management at Virginia Tech University, told the New York Times. ""Certainly the overapplication of pesticides is one of them."" "

The rumor mill surrounding Castro's health continued to churn Friday, Oct. 19, 2012, despite a letter from the aging Cuban revolutionary published by state-media and denials by relatives that he is on death's door. The latest spark to set the Internet aflame are claims by a Venezuelan doctor that Castro, 86, had suffered a massive stroke, was in a vegetative state, and had only weeks to live. (AP Photo/Cubadebate, Roberto Chile, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6eca250000330036100a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fidel Castro is rumored to have suffered an embolic stroke, according to news reports.Doctor Jose Marquina, who supposedly has firsthand knowledge of the 86-year-old former Cuban leader's health condition, told El Nuevo Herald that Castro is ""very close to a neurovegetative state.""However, the Associated Press reported that Marquina has made claims that never came to fruition in the past, and that Marquina would not identify his sources of knowledge regarding Castro's condition. The AP also reported that Castro's family members have denied that he is gravely ill. If Marquina's reports are indeed true, though, an embolic stroke would leave Castro with problems performing basic functions like eating, the New York Daily News reported.An embolic stroke is a type of ischemic stroke (an ischemic stroke is caused by blockages or narrowing of brain arteries, and comprises about 80 percent of all strokes). Embolic stroke is caused when a clot called an embolus that comes from another part of the body gets lodged in the brain's arteries, the National Stroke Association reported. The clot often comes from the heart. Common symptoms of a stroke include extreme headache, problems with balance and coordination, vision problems, feeling confused and sudden weakness/numbness, according to the University of Washington Medicine website. Conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, heart disease, diabetes, leading a sedentary lifestyle, being obese, smoking and drinking too much alcohol can all raise the risk of stroke. Other nonchangeable risk factors include being a man, being over the age of 55, having a family history and being African American, according to the Mayo Clinic. Recovery after a stroke differs from person to person, University of Washington Medicine reported, with younger people having better recovery than older people. "

Usually served in America as a digestivo after a big, hearty meal, it is like lemon rocket fuel in the best way. Instantly, you forget your over-indulgence in the food, as the hyperbolically citrusy stuff works its magic. We've seen the usual methods for making homemade limoncello before, but our jaws absolutely dropped when we read Toby Cecchini's ""Presto Chango Limoncello"" on The New York Times' blog. Cecchini's visit to Portland, Oregon's Nostrana was capped by a taste of the house-made limoncello. It appears even he didn't know what he had stumbled upon. Upon entering Nostrana, I had filed past its impressively towering bar and noticed, without knowing what I was looking at, a number of huge, covered glass urns with odd muslin hammocks hanging within, suspended above a few inches of liquid. Hmm, I pondered, some kind of nutty amaro experiments going on there? This is Portland, after all, where the only form of slacking that draws opprobrium is not making your own bitters, vermouths, tinctures and amari. After one sip of this beguiling, clearish-amber limoncello, which was eye-poppingly citric, with a force and clarity of flavor I’d never experienced in this drink before, I wandered back up to that bar to inquire about the recipe. Enter those strange jars.After seeking some guidance from both the similarly beguiled bartender and Cocktail Kingdom guru Don Lee, they determined that the process basically entails suspending citrus over high-proof alcohol, without letting the two elements ever actually touch. Once sealed, the high volatility of the booze begins to leech out the pure oils from the citrus, with no bitterness from pith or membrane. After nine weeks, with the addition of some sugar for sweetness and water to take the proof down a bit, you've (amazingly) got limoncello.Does this work? It appears to! We are obviously going to try it and promise to let you know. If anyone has any tips, we'd love to hear them in the comments!Get the whole story, plus step by step instructions over on NYT.com."
