4,ARTS,Stage Door: The Judas Kiss,"Fern Siegel, ContributorDeputy Editor, MediaPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stage-door-the-judas-kiss_b_10208070.html,"Oscar Wilde's story - his rise and fall - remains fascinating.

His plays were the toast of London and his 1895 masterwork The Importance of Being Earnest, was being staged at the time of his scandalous trial. His is now a familiar story.Bosie Douglas, Wilde's young lover, bullied him into bringing a libel suit against his loathsome father, the Marquess of Queensberry, who accused him of being a ""sodomite."" When it became clear that various rent boys would support the claim, Wilde dropped his suit. He was then charged with ""gross indecency,"" and, with the threat of jail imminent, given time to flee England.Wilde holes up at the Cadogan Hotel as his friend Robbie Ross (Cal MacAninch) begs him to leave. Bosie (Charlie Rowe), still pushing his own agenda, wants him to stay and fight. Wilde, known to be pompous and arrogant, is, in David Hare's The Judas Kiss, now at BAM's Harvey Theater, a kinder, gentler Oscar: still witty and clever, but more reflective and melancholy. Noting how many young men are en route France in the wake of the scandal, Wilde muses: ""Opera will be stone dead.""Wilde is played to perfection by Rupert Everett, who channels the legendary writer at every turn -- his wit, charm, exasperating ways and inexplicable Bosie obsession. His sharp, rueful performance alone is worth the price of admission.The play is Hare's thoughtful meditation on why Wilde chose to stay, since his inaction will lead to ruin. By act two, a shattered, broke Wilde is in Naples, inexplicably reunited with the ever-demanding, delusional Bosie, busy flaunting his boy toy.Hare tries to reconcile Wilde's public and private selves, to determine why he participates in his own downfall. (Wilde did not martyr himself for homosexuality at his trials, but stood for personal privacy.) The conniving Bosie, beset by daddy issues, is perceived as indifferent to Wilde's fate. His concerns, first, and foremost, are for himself.How did such a clever man, gifted at peeling the artifice from the aristocracy, allow himself to be used in such a spectacularly horrible fashion? The Judas Kiss, which enjoyed a successful run at the Hampstead Theater in London, isn't so much a dramatic effort as a compelling examination into the complexities and contradictions of Wilde.The tension in act one is intense, thanks to Neil Armfield's tight direction, but ultimately, it is more about the inexplicable decisions that altered his life.The play showcases the wonder of Wilde -- and mourns the loss of his considerable talent. The instinct for self-preservation -- if not for himself and his genius, then his children -- is appallingly MIA. And always, there is the scheming, self-involved Bosie. Rowe is well cast; he captures Bosie's manipulative ways, as well as his hair-trigger temper, with precision.It's been 116 years since the great playwright's death -- yet Hare's The Judas Kiss reminds us that the ill-fated alliance proved Wilde right: ""Each man kills the thing he loves."" In Wilde's case, it's himself.Photo: Richard Termine"

Marco Rubio says you can probably expect to see him on the national stage again.The Florida Republican, who dropped out of the 2016 presidential race in March after badly losing his home state's primary, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday it is a ""safe assumption"" that he will run for office again.""Yes, I think that's a safe assumption,"" Rubio said, before offering a caveat. ""But I don't know where I'm going to be in two years. I mean, check back in two years. That -- that's always the caveat. Two years from now, perhaps I'm working on a project I don't want to walk away from or maybe there's a situation to realize with my kids that I need to spend more time.""He added: ""So who knows what's around the corner? I don't know. I can tell you I enjoy public service. If there's an opportunity to serve again in a way that I feel passionate about, I'll most certainly think I would explore it.""Rubio is reportedly getting ""intense pressure” to run for re-election to his Florida Senate seat due to concerns from GOP leadership that it could fall to Democrats in November. Real estate mogul Donald Trump, who succeeded in clinching the GOP nomination this week, even urged him to run for his seat.But Rubio told reporters this week he's ""unlikely” to run for re-election because Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a good friend of his, is in the race."
6,POLITICS,"Libertarian Party Selects Gary Johnson, William Weld For Presidential Ticket",Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/libertarian-party-presidential-gary_us_574aff19e4b03ede44151293,"After overcoming a contested convention, the party now needs to scale up fast enough to make a difference in the November election.",2016-05-29,"Gary Johnson speaks to supporters at the National Libertarian Party Convention Friday in Orlando, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_226_2492_2649%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld secured the Libertarian Party's respective nominations for president and vice president Sunday, capping off the party's weekend-long biennial convention.The nominations came after an often raucous nominating convention. Johnson was unable to obtain the necessary 50-plus percent of convention delegates on the first round of balloting. He ultimately finished with 55.8 percent of delegates supporting him.Weld won on the second ballot with 51 percent support. The Libertarian Party selects its president and vice president separately.Johnson and Weld will now serve as the standard-bearers for the economically conservative, socially liberal party. Interest in alternative presidential candidacies has spiked recently, due in part to the historically low approval ratings of Republican presumptive nominee businessman Donald Trump and likely Democratic nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Several recent polls have found Johnson, who served as New Mexico's Republican governor from 1995 to 2003 and was the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee in 2012, earning the support of around 10 percent of likely voters.Thus far, the Johnson-Weld campaign has been running a mostly shoestring operation, focusing more on building support within the party than soliciting support for the general election. With their ticket set, the Libertarians' goal now is to create a national campaign infrastructure -- raising funds and building up field, digital, press and other operations necessary to remain competitive. A number of party officials this weekend expressed hope that large-dollar donors would flock to the Libertarian Party due to frustration with the Democratic and Republican tickets.""If [the nomination] happens, I think there will be a lot of money that will roll into this campaign and given a lot of money,"" Johnson said Saturday. ""I think we'll have a lot of real expertise at the table that we haven't had to this point and would be able to strategize."" Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark told The Huffington Post the goal will be to entice disillusioned bundlers and so-called megadonors to donate to his party. ""[I'll be] explaining why the return on their political investment for putting money into the Libertarian Party is so much better than the return on political investment for putting money into one of the old parties,"" Sarwark said.""I've talk to three or four people just at this convention who have super PACs right now who don't have a candidate to support,"" he continued. ""[They] are here to see who we nominate and to see if that's a ticket that they can get their network behind.""In addition, the Johnson campaign and Libertarian Party officials have their sights set on the presidential debates, which they view as their best chance of reaching a wider audience. The Commission on Presidential Debates mandates that a candidate receive 15 percent in national polls to earn a spot in the debate. The Johnson campaign is currently involved in a lawsuit against the commission to lower the threshold.Johnson's running mate, Weld, was thrown into jeopardy this weekend as activists raised concerns over Weld's ideological bona fides. Weld was a state campaign chair for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and many in the party viewed his recent addition to the ticket with suspicion. Many also expressed concerns over his decision in 2006 to leave the New York gubernatorial race after securing the Libertarian nomination, leaving the party without a candidate. Weld's attempt to stem the bleeding only made matters worse. In a debate on Friday, he voiced his support for the United Nations, a bête noire in libertarian circles.

Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld secured the Libertarian Party's respective nominations for president and vice president Sunday, capping off the party's weekend-long biennial convention.The nominations came after an often raucous nominating convention. Johnson was unable to obtain the necessary 50-plus percent of convention delegates on the first round of balloting. He ultimately finished with 55.8 percent of delegates supporting him.Weld won on the second ballot with 51 percent support. The Libertarian Party selects its president and vice president separately.Johnson and Weld will now serve as the standard-bearers for the economically conservative, socially liberal party. Interest in alternative presidential candidacies has spiked recently, due in part to the historically low approval ratings of Republican presumptive nominee businessman Donald Trump and likely Democratic nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Several recent polls have found Johnson, who served as New Mexico's Republican governor from 1995 to 2003 and was the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee in 2012, earning the support of around 10 percent of likely voters.Thus far, the Johnson-Weld campaign has been running a mostly shoestring operation, focusing more on building support within the party than soliciting support for the general election. With their ticket set, the Libertarians' goal now is to create a national campaign infrastructure -- raising funds and building up field, digital, press and other operations necessary to remain competitive. A number of party officials this weekend expressed hope that large-dollar donors would flock to the Libertarian Party due to frustration with the Democratic and Republican tickets.""If [the nomination] happens, I think there will be a lot of money that will roll into this campaign and given a lot of money,"" Johnson said Saturday. ""I think we'll have a lot of real expertise at the table that we haven't had to this point and would be able to strategize."" Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark told The Huffington Post the goal will be to entice disillusioned bundlers and so-called megadonors to donate to his party. ""[I'll be] explaining why the return on their political investment for putting money into the Libertarian Party is so much better than the return on political investment for putting money into one of the old parties,"" Sarwark said.""I've talk to three or four people just at this convention who have super PACs right now who don't have a candidate to support,"" he continued. ""[They] are here to see who we nominate and to see if that's a ticket that they can get their network behind.""In addition, the Johnson campaign and Libertarian Party officials have their sights set on the presidential debates, which they view as their best chance of reaching a wider audience. The Commission on Presidential Debates mandates that a candidate receive 15 percent in national polls to earn a spot in the debate. The Johnson campaign is currently involved in a lawsuit against the commission to lower the threshold.Johnson's running mate, Weld, was thrown into jeopardy this weekend as activists raised concerns over Weld's ideological bona fides. Weld was a state campaign chair for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and many in the party viewed his recent addition to the ticket with suspicion. Many also expressed concerns over his decision in 2006 to leave the New York gubernatorial race after securing the Libertarian nomination, leaving the party without a candidate. Weld's attempt to stem the bleeding only made matters worse. In a debate on Friday, he voiced his support for the United Nations, a bête noire in libertarian circles. Exacerbating the situation, he said libertarians are often regarded as “unattractive people.” On Saturday, when another attendee called for reducing the CIA's presence overseas, Weld replied that he was possibly biased in the matter, name-checking Kermit Roosevelt Jr, his ""great uncle in-law"" and a leading CIA figure who helped depose a number of foreign governments, including the 1953 overthrow of Iran's democratically elected leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh.

John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who was recently selected to chair the Republican National Convention's platform committee, shied away from criticizing Donald Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim entry to the U.S. -- a policy that Republican Senate leadership described in December as “completely inconsistent with American values.” When Republicans distanced themselves from Trump’s controversial and unconstitutional Muslim ban last year, there were still over a dozen GOP presidential candidates, and lawmakers were likely hopeful they wouldn’t have to contend with Trump as their nominee. Now that Trump has clinched enough delegates to secure the nomination, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl asked Barrasso to clarify the party’s position on the Muslim ban. It was clear that was the last thing Barrasso wanted to speak about, as he attempted to steer the conversation to jobs and wages, addressing the proposed ban only in vague references to the party’s platform on national security. Here is their exchange:JONATHAN KARL: Well, Trump has won. What -- where does the party now stand on that Muslim ban?Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Earlier this week, Trump described New Mexico as a state with high unemployment and dependence on food stamps -- and accused Martinez of bearing the responsibility. “Your governor has got to do a better job,” he said. “She’s not doing the job. Hey, maybe I’ll run for governor of New Mexico. I’ll get this place going.” Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R), who has been generally supportive of Trump’s campaign, called the comments “very, very, destructive” and said it “sent all the wrong signals.” When asked by Wallace about the wisdom of Trump attacking Martinez, given his unpopularity among women and Latinos, Lewandowski insisted the candidate is polling well with both groups. “Donald Trump is winning with Latinos, if you look at the last poll, he’s winning with Hispanics, if you look at the polls, he’s doing very well with women,” the campaign manager said, prompting Wallace to interrupt him. “Wait, Corey,” Wallace said. “He’s not winning with women and he’s not winning with Hispanics. His numbers are hugely underwater with both!”Latinos favor Trump’s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, by a 39-point margin, according to a recent Fox News Latino poll.

Then Curry, who has struggled throughout the series against the long-armed Thunder, found something that looked a lot like his confidence, knocking down two critical threes, one to bring them within one with just under four minute to go. Then another just over a minute later to tie it, 99-99. Then, with just 1:35 to go, Thompson hit his final three, putting the Warriors up for the first time in the fourth. They would never trail again.Durant ended the game the game with 29 points and and 7 rebounds. Westbrook pulled together 28 points, 9 rebounds and 11 assists.

UNC lawyers suggested the same thing in a court filing, writing that the system has not “changed any of its policies or practices regarding transgender students or employees” and that HB2 doesn’t provide any guidance on enforcement.Multiple plaintiffs are taking the UNC system to court in response to HB2, saying it's discriminatory. The law states that when it comes to multiple-occupancy bathrooms in government buildings or public schools and colleges, everyone must use the restroom corresponding with the sex indicated on their birth certificate. In other words, a person who was assigned female at birth and now identifies as a man would still have to use the women’s bathroom.The law also removed legal anti-discrimination protection for LGBTQ people.The UNC system is asking the court to postpone the civil case, pending the outcome of a separate case in Virginia involving a teen suing a county school board over a policy barring him from using the boys' bathroom."

""Always remember, a struggle is not easy -- that is why it is called a 'struggle' rather than a 'picnic,'"" Edwards said. A graduate of SJSU himself -- 52 years earlier -- Edwards reminded grads that some of the most meaningful social and political changes in American history, like the Voting Rights Act, marriage equality and the labor movement, were once considered too radical for reality. ""Mass movements are part of the DNA of American political democracy,"" he said. Edwards' own views, once considered militant, are now seen as representative of the university's own ideals, Interim President Susan Martin said in a statement. It was Edwards who inspired SJSU students Tommie Smith and John Carlos to make the Black Power salute on the podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico -- an overtly political statement in what had traditionally been an apolitical event. Both men were members of an anti-segregation group, The Olympic Project for Human Rights, which Edwards founded. In order to change the status quo, Edwards said graduates must also shun the ""culture of fear"" that has gripped America. ""The rule of thumb in America today seems to be, 'Be whatever you want, but be afraid,'"" he said. ""Fear leads to dislike; dislike leads to disrespect and disrespect leads to disengagement and hostile relations.""Edwards said the current moment represents ""where we are, not who we are."" ""A major obligation of your generation, by both action and example, will be to bring this nation back that distance from 'where' to 'who' we are,"" he said. Though he assured graduates they face no small amount of work ahead, Edwards advised faith, boldness and plenty of risk-taking. ""It is easy to arrive at the conclusion that things are so bad, so complicated, confused and intractable that there is nothing that can be done to even influence, much less to change the status quo,"" Edwards said. ""Be bold: Step up and step out; as the jazz artists say, don't be afraid to stretch out."""

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) mocked Donald Trump for, among other things, his face, his hair, and the size of his hands ... er, manhood.It wasn’t exactly high-minded stuff. And though Rubio had been goaded into going down this route – Trump had been calling him ""Little Marco"" for weeks and joyfully mocked his preternatural dehydration – he ended up apologizing for it.“I want my kids to be proud of me, and I don’t think it reflected well on my faith,” he said. “That’s not who I am.”Turns out, Rubio’s apology tour was done in private as well as public. In an interview with CNN that aired Sunday, he explained that he also expressed his regrets directly to Trump.""I actually told Donald -- one of the debates, I forget which one -- I apologized to him for that,"" Rubio said. ""I said, 'You know, I'm sorry that I said that. It's not who I am and I shouldn't have done it.' I didn't say it in front of the cameras, I didn't want any political benefit.""It’s unclear if Trump returned the favor. But the presumptive Republican nominee has seemed to warm to Rubio in recent weeks, even encouraging him to reconsider his decision not to run for re-election.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
19,GREEN,New Video Shows Zoo Gorilla With Boy Before Ape Was Shot Dead,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gorilla-cincinnati-zoo-video-shot_us_5749f024e4b03ede44150165,A 4-year-old boy fell into the animal's enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo.,2016-05-29,Harambe in an undated photo from the Cincinnati Zoo.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574b18031200002500894ccb.jpeg?cache=tRSybZVeeT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Newly released video shows the moments just after a 4-year-old boy crawled into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo, which led to zoo officials shooting and killing the animal.After the boy, whose name has not been released, got into the enclosure, the gorilla, a 17-year-old western lowland silverback named Harambe, dragged the boy around, and picked him up and held him. Zoo officials feared for the boy’s safety, and Director Thane Maynard said at a press conference that they did not use tranquilizers because the drugs would take too long to take effect.Video of the incident taken by zoo visitor Kim O’Connor was published by local news station WLWT on Saturday. A longer video uploaded to YouTube also shows the gorilla dragging the boy by one of his limbs. The video does not show the gorilla being shot.O’Connor said she overheard talking about the boy wanting to get into the enclosure before the incident took place.“The little boy himself had already been talking about wanting to ... get in the water,” she told WLWT. “The mother's like, 'No, you're not, no, you're not.”She noted that the boy’s mother was also watching several other young children. Officials believe the boy crawled through a railing barrier, then fell into the moat around the enclosure. He was taken to a hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.The child was never actually under attack, Maynard admitted at the press conference. But Maynard said the zoo considered the situation life-threatening since the “extremely strong” 400-pound gorilla was in an agitated state.Animal behaviorist Dave Salmoni (whose methods have proven somewhat controversial) told ""Good Morning America"" on Sunday that he wouldn’t second-guess the zoo’s decision to kill the gorilla.“I would say it’s easy to suggest this is life-threatening danger,” Salmoni said. “In a captive environment, you never know how an animal’s going to react to something like this. And typically a silverback gorilla can either be nervous of something like this, something new, like a child entering the enclosure, or react aggressively, and it’s the aggressive reaction you really have to worry about.”Salmoni noted that zookeepers typically care deeply for their animals, and that people should provide the best possible care for the many animals in captivity.But, he added, “In a perfect world, there would be no animals in zoos.”This story has been updated to include footage of the gorilla dragging the boy."

T.I.'s representatives referred The Huffington Post to the rapper's Instagram account on Thursday where he shared his prayers and condolences to those injured at the event. Accepting the role as a runaway slave in the “Roots” remake wasn’t necessarily an easy decision for T.I.The reboot, which stars Malachi Kirby, Anika Noni Rose, Laurence Fishburne, and Forest Whitaker, finds the Grammy Award-winner reuniting with producer Will Packer, who previously worked together on the 2010 film, “Takers.”Although, the pair established a solid rapport while filming the action thriller, Tip (as he is also known as) says he was initially reluctant to join Packer’s revamped miniseries.""This was an opportunity that he presented to me, and of course initially he got a little bit of push back from me,” T.I. said during an interview with HuffPost. “I will admit that I was one of the ones to say, ‘Man, I don’t know if that needs to be remade.’ It was just a huge undertaking for him as a producer and for me as an actor to sign up to remake such a classic and to tell a story that has so much pain and just so much turmoil involved in it.”After additional convincing from Packer, T.I. went on to add that the producer finally talked him into signing on for the role of Cyrus -- who is described as a headstrong slave fighting for freedom for the Union Army against Confederate Forces -- and that he’s “really, really pleased and ecstatic” with the choice he made to be involved with the project.Though he admits he doesn’t know slavery personally, the 35-year-old says he prepared for the role by inserting himself in the mind of “someone who would do anything for freedom,” in addition to pulling from his past experiences of being incarcerated.“I do know what it’s like to have your freedom be taken from you or to not have it be available to you,” he said. “I kind of amplified my thoughts and how I felt when my freedom was separate and apart from me. So I kind of took that and pushed upon it, because Cyrus is actually thee most rebellious and non-subservient character that there is. You never see Cyrus in ‘Roots’ as a slave, he’s always a runaway slave – running, dodging bullets and doing whatever it takes to maintain his freedom. So it wasn’t as slave written as the rest of the characters, but I think all of the characters collectively to the story are important.”The History Channel's reboot of “Roots” will premiere as a four-night series event tonight, and simulcast on A&E and Lifetime."

That's right, fellas. When you are truly, finally ready to cut the cord, literally, and call it quits with having any more kids -- or any kids -- forever, the best and only way to go is to proudly cross the River Zero Sperm with a weekend that begins, and ends, with everything, and anything, that makes you (and only you) happy! Every VIP Vasectomy Weekend should begin at the very end of the week. Book your vasectomy for the very last appointment an urologist has -- Friday afternoon, 5 p.m. Why? It's the weekend, silly, and nothing stands in your way until Monday. Next, choose an urologist who not only knows what the hell he is doing (duh!), but who is so damn entertaining, and funny, that he makes you laugh during the procedure. That's exactly what I did when I booked my guy, Dr. J at the Center of Urologic Care in Pittsburgh, PA. Here's how damn funny Dr. J is: Banana Don (I know, I know), a Pittsburgh morning radio DJ, had Dr. J do his vasectomy live while on the air. But, really, how funny can an urologist really be? Right after Dr. J cauterized my vas deferens, a puff of smoke from his surgical cauterizing gun rose in the air from what I considered to be my holiest shrine in the world -- my testicles. Dr. J, seeing my surprise, and concern about smoke rising slowly from my balls, stared into my eyes behind his surgical mask to calm me. I then saw a crease of a big smile forming underneath the mask, from which came this punch line: ""Well, guess we have a new Pope.""When your vasectomy is finally over, which usually takes just 15-30 minutes, all in, assuming everything goes right, your weekend is not at all about having a bag of peas on your lap the rest of the weekend. Nope, for me, it was all about margaritas and the best damn guacamole that I've ever tasted at an amazing Mexican restaurant in the ""Burgh"" as I began my exciting new journey along the Childless Freedom Trail. The day after, my VIP Vas Weekend continued with all day and into the night college football. I took a few breaks, now and then, with an occasional leisurely walk (don't dare run, fellas), just to make sure everything felt and moved right. They did. The frozen peas? I put 'em back in the freezer. Here's the thing that I really didn't need, ever again: more children. Don't get me wrong. I have two amazing wonderful boys, 22 and 20, who make me proud to be a Papa, every single day. But I don't want any more. Zero. Zilch. The End. So getting a vas was the best decision that I ever made. But there are plenty of guys out there who don't want more kids, but are so scared of getting snipped that they are willing to gamble by shooting live ammo. They're idiots. Dr. J couldn't agree more. ""There's no reason why men should be on a Russian roulette wheel worrying if they are going to get their partners pregnant every time they have sex,"" he says. ""Men should get a vasectomy because it is very effective and durable. If he is in a relationship, it is so much easier for a man to get it (sterilized) than a woman who has to go through a much more involved procedure which allows her to avoid taking additional medications or placing devices within her body.""So why are guys so damn scared of getting it done? ""Most patients fear the needle, which is placed into the scrotum to numb the area,"" Dr. J says. ""It takes literally 90 seconds to render the area anesthetized and then usually 20 minutes to complete the procedure through a single incision. Some patients fear that they will lose their interest in sex or that the ejaculate will change significantly. Neither of these are true.""One thing is for damn sure, however: you will never, ever forget it. ""I ran into Banana Don several months after his vas at a promotion for the local zoo,"" Dr. J recalls. ""I asked him if he remembered me, and he quickly said, 'absolutely, anyone who handles Banana's boys is burned into my memory forever.'"" But let's get back to the VIP Vasectomy Weekend, shall we? It's common knowledge in the urology universe that vasectomies spike during major sporting events -- NBA Finals, The Masters, The World Series, the Stanley Cup, the NFL playoffs, you name it. For me, given that I was in Pittsburgh and all, I picked the weekend of the best rivalry in professional football -- Steelers vs. Ravens, Sunday night's premiere game as my ultimate VIP Vasectomy Weekend. Did I go? Hell to the yeah, I was right there, cheering on the black and gold Steel Curtain, after enjoying a full-on BBQ tailgate bash. Guess who was sitting next to me at kickoff? Yep. Dr. J himself. Sure, I faced a little pain that weekend, but nothing two Advil couldn't handle. ""There can be rare complications with a vasectomy, which can include swelling, prolonged bruising, wound infections, prolonged soreness,"" according to Dr. J. For me, I had a bruised scrotum for a good week or two. And I'll be honest -- it felt a little weird down there for a few weeks after. But when the time finally arrived for me to find out if I had any sperm swimmers left, when the big ""0"" came back on my sperm analysis report, all I was finally left with was my happy memory of the best VIP Vasectomy Weekend, ever.

It is important today to realize that to lead others you must first lead yourself.I've dedicated my life to providing a proven methodology and learning management system that teaches you how to organize your life around your identity. This knowledge allows for the application of the gifts of entrepreneurs, and in the BVI, the intention is to propel the achievement of a sustainable socioeconomic vision through a well-defined set of policies, educational programs and business infrastructure. The result of the three-day event was the igniting of an entrepreneurial flame within a relatively small but richly diverse group of individuals who collectively have the capacity to change the socioeconomic landscape of the BVI. From my vantage point, developing and maintaining success in a community or country is due in large measure to recognizing that change starts with the individual. Businesses, and those that lead and are employed by them, are the drivers of economies. They are the engine that affects family, finances, community and culture. Doing business, while managing leadership success in the 21st century, is riddled with complexities and opportunities. Now is the time for leadership, change, improvement, growth, and the acceptance of new challenges as they continue to emerge. The differentiator is whether you, your workforce, and your constituents are prepared with the skills and mindset to meet these challenges.   Starting with the 'self' requires that we begin by helping each person understand his or her identity. This process begins with the realization of what you are passionate about, followed by the development of a vision driven by a set of core values. Many people spend a lifetime life working below their potential. This is a core reason why the BVI leadership is fostering creativity, entrepreneurialism, and lifelong learning habits necessary for people to thrive in the 21st century.The ""Innovation Through Giftedness"" program was executed in the BVI under the leadership of Mr. Meade Malone, CEO MWM Global Holdings, Blue Ocean Enterprises Limited and REVOLT TV. The exceptional individuals who answered the call to demonstrate their products and services in a competitive format received instruction and guidance on how to build the foundation for taking their business to the next level. Knowing who they are and the pathway to success....imagine what they will achieve and how they will impact their country!It is critical that we each define our skills or gifts, and use our 24-hours in each day to continuously learn and improve as we fulfill our purpose. The result will be the sustainable awakening of the socioeconomic engine at every level of the society. One of the many valuable takeaways that I was able to leave with the participants was the understanding that if each of them take what they love and are passionate about, download information around those things and organize a process of continuous improvement and mastery, they would achieve freedom. Freedom to succeed, freedom to grow, freedom to make a difference, freedom to positively impact their families, organizations, villages, towns, cities, islands, states, countries, nations and indeed the world. This view was supported by Mr. Kelly Griffin, head of music programming, REVOLT TV, who encouraged participants to ""Study your craft...the greats such as Beyoncé, Prince and P. Diddy, studied their craft... That is what will make you great.""Notably, the program included a forum discussion that involved public and private sector representatives at the highest levels to identify the specific program, policy, regulation and business infrastructure necessary to build a sustainable foundation for achieving the socioeconomic goals of the BVI. A key outcome of the forum, identified by Premier of the BVI, Dr. the Hon. D Orlando Smith, was insights on building the capacity for BVI businesses to become major employers and exporters. Asked by Forum Host, Mr. Meade Malone about some of the things that could be done to ensure that the vision for entrepreneurship in the BVI becomes a reality, Mr. Curt Richardson, Founder, Chairman and Chief Visionary Officer of Otter Products LLC, encouraged the government, to invest in educating entrepreneurs and advised that it does not have to be done in a formal manner. ""What is important in building the entrepreneurial ecosystem is building in the education that is critical to giving them the tools to assist with the blocking and tackling of business. Education can come through mentoring, internet based learning, formal class room training and coaching."" -Mr. Curt RichardsonRichardson further suggested that government can allocate resources to assist entrepreneurs by establishing economic zones with low rent and ensure their placement in high traffic tourist areas. Additionally, considerations could be given to some form of subsidy that would help entrepreneurs learn the value of developing a good reputation and taking responsibility for the own success.

He fled ahead of the American troops he knew were coming and the remaining guards escaped when two American tanks appeared on April 13th.Frank W. Towers, a first Lieutenant of the 30th Infantry Division, reported that the stench when the locked cattle cars were opened ""was almost unbearable, and many of the men had to rush away and vomit. We had heard of the cruel treatment which the Nazis had been handing out to Jews and political opponents of the Nazi regime, whom they had enslaved, but we thought it was propaganda and exaggerated. As we went along [in Germany] it became more apparent that this barbaric savagery was actually true.""(Frank Towers in France, 1944)The troops that had found this train were racing to the Elbe because it was the last barrier to their advance across Germany. Now they had a totally unexpected burden of some twenty-five hundred prisoners to house and provide for. The answer was about nine miles to the west. American troops had just captured several hundred Germans at the Wehrmacht base and proving ground in Hillersleben where tests had been conducted for giant railway guns manufactured by Krupp.It was an ironic place for Jews to be sheltered, cared for, and brought back to life. But then what place in Germany wouldn't have been?This verdant military setting with clean, heated quarters for officers and soldiers was a virtual paradise for people who had been treated like animals for years. That's where my parents met and fell in love. My mother was in Hillersleben because she had escaped from a slave labor camp in Magdeburg 16 miles away and been brought there by American troops now using it as a temporary Displaced Persons camp.(One of the now-abandoned buildings at the Hillersleben DP camp)She and my father had each lost everything in what would come to be called the Holocaust: home, families, countries. There wasn't any time to play pre-war games. ""Do you like me?"" he asked. She did, and as my father tersely put it years later, from that moment on, ""She was mine and I was hers."" My mother moved in with him that night, beginning their fifty-four years together.Frank Towers, now 97, is the last surviving soldier who rescued the prisoners on that train. I've had the honor of meeting Frank and shaking his hand, and I've written about him in my memoir My Germany. On Memorial Day, with the survivors of the Holocaust and their saviors dwindling faster and faster, it's more important than ever to thank the ""train heroes"" who are no longer alive.The account in this blog is excerpted from My Germany: A Jewish Writer Returns to the World His Parents Escaped.

27,POLITICS,Middle East- Six Reasons Why Iran Will Not Leave Yemen,"Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, ContributorPresident of the International American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/six-reasons-why-iran-will_b_10190216.html,,2016-05-29,2016-03-12-1457793374-8912173-ScreenShot20160310at4.38.54PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-12-1457793374-8912173-ScreenShot20160310at4.38.54PM-thumb.png,"When a conflict erupts in a state, some countries which are not bordered with the conflict-affected state use political opportunism to direct the war in their interest.Massoud Jazayiri, deputy head of Iran's Armed Forces, recently told Iran's Tasnim news agency, that Iran is ready to copycat the process it adopted in Syria and use it in Yemen as well. He added that Iran is prepared to send ""military advisers"" in support of the Houthis in Yemen.Several of Iran's weapons shipments, which were likely heading to war-torn Yemen, had also been seized.The statement by the deputy head of Iran's Armed Forces, referring to repeating Iran's role in Yemen, is more of an exaggerated political posturing than reality.Iran's role in the war in Yemen is multidimensional. On the surface, Yemen does not seem to bear geopolitical or strategic significance for the Iranian leaders. Yemen's conflict also does not pose a national security threat to Iran. But, why Iran is determined to have a role in Yemen's war and direct it in its favor?The ideological factorOne dimension of Iran's involvement in Yemen is ideological. One core pillar of its foreign policy is anchored in its Islamic revolutionary principles.The key decision maker in Iran's foreign policy is the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who pursues the ideology of his predecessor, Ayatollah Rooh Allah Khomenei, the founding figure of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khamenei has shown almost no deviation from Khomeini's ideals.In addition, Khamenei gives weight to the information he receives from his close advisors in the Office of the Supreme Leader (not the President, the foreign minister, or other powerful clerics) and the hardline senior cadre of Iran's revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).One of Khamenei's underlying revolutionary values is that he views himself as the leader of the Islamic world and he views Iran as the vanguard of Muslims. In fact, his official website refers to him as the ""Supreme Leader of Muslims"", not the Supreme Leader of ""Iran"" or solely the ""Shiites"".As a result, from Khamenei's perspective, as a supreme leader of Muslims, using rhetoric, influencing, and directing the political affairs of every Muslim country, including Yemen, is his religious and ideological duty.In addition, since Khamenei views himself as the leader of Muslims, he has naturally positioned himself to view Saudi Arabia as a competitor and rival. Showing his ideological influence in Yemen gives him leverage against Riyadh.Other revolutionary ideals include anti-Americanism. Khamenei regards his rhetoric and projection of Iran's increasing role in Yemen's conflict is a tactic to counter-balance the US role in the region.The geopolitical and strategic reasonsIran considers itself, and desires to be treated, as the paramount power in the Middle East because of it strategic significance, geographic location, military capabilities, economic strength, wealth and natural resources (such as holding the second and fourth largest gas and oil reserves in the world), and size of its population (second largest most populous nation in the Middle East after Egypt).Iran's regional hegemonic ambitions direct the Iranian leaders to pursue policies which are aimed at countering the power of other regional state actors (mainly Saudi Arabia), and weakening their strategic, economic and geopolitical significance in order to tip the regional balance of power in favor of Tehran.While Yemen does not pose a national security threat to Iran, it does to Saudi Arabia since it shares a border with Riyadh. Iran seizes this opportunity, by supporting the Houthis, to challenge Saudi Arabia, making it look more vulnerable, all while Tehran is showing off its regional significance to Saudi Arabia and how it can cause a security threat to Riyadh.In addition, by diverting the Saudi's attention to Yemen, Iran is attempting to create a quagmire for Riyadh in Yemen, making it bogged down in Sanaa, in order to draw it away from Syria and Iraq; Iran's main allies.Iran also seizes the opportunity to increase its leverage against Riyadh and use Yemen as a strategic bargaining chip, to push Saudi Arabia to change it policy toward Damascus, Baghdad, Bahrain or other countries where Iran exerts influence.Economic, ethnic and sectarian factorsEconomically speaking, Yemen is not as costly for Iran as Syria is, but it brings many benefits. Yemen is a low cost opportunity for Iran (Unlike Syria) where Iran can have presence near the border of Saudi Arabia, its rival. Ethnically speaking, and in terms of nationalism, Iran views one layer of its competition against Saudi Arabia as the rivalry between Persians and Arabs. Iran's influence in Yemen helps Tehran in this respect.Although Iran views itself as the vanguard of both Sunnis and Shiites, it does contain a covert sectarian agenda in supporting the Shiites (or an offshoot of Shiism) to improve and extend its influence in other countries.Finally, Iran's strategy of expanding its influence in the region is to create proxies in Muslim countries and make a political reality out of them over time to influence the domestic affairs of those nations (as it has done with Hezbollah and other Shiite groups in Iraq)._______________________Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is an American political scientist, business advisor, US foreign policy, Iran and Middle East expert, and the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

But that won't stop yet another committee from trying mightily to manufacture them.",2016-05-29,"A combination photo shows U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (L) and Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump (R) in Los Angeles, California on May 5, 2016 and in Eugene, Oregon, U.S. on May 6, 2016 respectively. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson (L) and Jim Urquhart/File Photos",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81633200000c701019187.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There will be no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton in the flap over the use of her private server for State Department business. There will be no finding that Clinton broke any federal laws in using her private server. There is no evidence whatsoever that Clinton jeopardized national security by the use of her private server. The never-ending, House-controlled GOP investigating committees have not found and will not find any new improprieties in the email flap. But that won't stop yet another committee from trying mightily to manufacture them. The point will be made again and again that former Secretary of State Colin Powell also used his private email server during his stint at State. The point will also be made that the protocols about the use of a private email server to conduct official government business were tightened after Clinton's state Department tenure.Any other time, this would render the issue of Clinton's emails a non-issue. However, this isn't any other time. What Clinton did or didn't do with her emails and what she knew or didn't know about their use, was never the issue. The issue is Clinton in the White House. The GOP attack line is that Clinton is shady, untrustworthy and, less charitably, a serial liar. This has been ramped up just enough by the State Department inspector general, finger pointing at Clinton for being sloppy and careless in the use of her emails and not telling the truth about it. This is fed by a media that salivates at the mere hint of any Clinton scandal. None of this is really new stuff, and there's no foreseeable possibility that this could derail Clinton's campaign. This doesn't mean that there aren't danger signs in the email controversy. The first is the danger that it could reinforce the very widespread notion that Clinton is prone to shade the truth about embarrassing or compromising issues. When the email flap broke in March 2015, polls did show two things. One is that a lot of people were paying attention to it and that they didn't like it, or, in far too many cases, her. It was at this point that the Clinton negatives began to march upward. The negatives were not just among Republicans. That was predictable. However, many Democrats and independents also began to mumble doubts about her too.This was the point that the label of ""dishonest"" and ""untrustworthy"" became a regular feature of the GOP's talking points about Clinton. It also was embedded in much of the chatter from the media and public about Clinton. At every turn, Clinton had to hear shouts from some in the media about her emails and what this said about her integrity. It got so bad that Bernie Sanders tossed out a great throw-away line in a debate about being sick of talking about ""those damn emails."" The issue, though, wasn't going to go away. The fresh report from the inspector general that raised a cloud over Clinton's truthfulness about the emails made sure that it stayed front and center.The second danger is that the issue could continue to rear its head as a distraction during the general election showdown with Trump. The few times that Trump doesn't try to hammer her with it, others will, and Clinton will have to take precious time out to again answer questions about what she did and why she did it with her emails. This poses the greatest danger of all. That is that the campaign will be the kind of campaign that Trump revels in. This is a campaign of muckraking, dirt and mud-slinging, personal insult, insinuations and character assassination. Trump has tried to do that with his attacks on Bill Clinton as a serial sexual abuser, and worse, a rapist. The aim was to get Hillary into a public media shouting match with him over the tawdry allegation. Hillary hasn't take the bait. But there will be more to come.The aim, as always, is twofold. One is to plant the seed even deeper in the general public that the Clintons are the personification of sleaze. The other is to blur, ignore and flat out dodge any real talk about tax reform job growth and the economy, health care, wealth and income inequality, civil rights, environmental concerns and criminal justice reforms. These are the issues that any election should be about, and what the media and the public should care about. But when you have a candidate who can throw a big ballpark curve on sex and emails, then the temptation to obsessively chatter on about this could prove too irresistible to pass on.Clinton will do everything she can to try to take the high road and let the inspector general's reports speak for themselves; that is to say that there was no law breaking involved and move on. The danger is that others will do everything possible to make sure she can't.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

29,WORLDPOST,The Race to Raqqa: The Next Russian-American Proxy Battle?,"Joseph V. Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-race-to-raqqa-the-nex_b_10193766.html,,2016-05-29,2016-05-29-1464526349-2652813-RaqqaBombedoutstreet.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-29-1464526349-2652813-RaqqaBombedoutstreet-thumb.jpg," A bombed out street in Raqqa, Spring 2016The war against the Islamic State (IS) is about to enter a new, possibly decisive phase. For the first time since it overran large portions of Syria and Iraq and declared its caliphate, IS militants are about to come under simultaneous attacks targeting three of their key urban strongholds: Raqqa, Fallujah and Mosul. More importantly, the developing battle for Raqqa is becoming a race between the Russian backed Syrian Army and the US backed Syrian Democratic Forces to see who will claim the political windfall that will accrue to Raqqa's liberators. In the process, the Raqqa campaign is also becoming a new proxy contest between the White House and the Kremlin.Despite the scope of the upcoming military campaigns and notwithstanding that Islamic State has steadily lost ground over the past year, leading to a reduction of its territory by roughly a quarter, the outcome of a victory over Islamic State is far from certain. Even as it comes under simultaneous attack, IS militants are taking advantage of the weakness of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), itself the focus of attacks by Syrian Military Forces and their Russian allies, to seize new territory from the FSA close to the Turkish-Syrian border. Moreover, as the pressure on IS grows, it is responding by ramping up terrorist attacks against Shia civilians in Iraq and is, in all probability, looking for opportunities to stage new terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States. Further complicating the military campaign against Islamic State is the fact that the political consensus that must underlay a successful battle plan is at best fragile and at worst nonexistent.In Syria, two separate military forces are attempting to advance on the IS capital at Raqqa. The Syrian military has been advancing from the southwest, since February 10, along Highway 42, the Salamiyah-Raqqa road. As of May 28, Syrian forces were about 15 miles east of Resafa, one of the last major towns along Highway 42 before Raqqa, and the strategic junction with Highway 6. This places them about 30 miles, as the crow flies, from Raqqa. In addition, Syrian forces were about 20 miles southwest of al-Tabqah, and more importantly the al-Tabqah Dam. Islamic State has turned the dam into a military stronghold. IS militants are taking refuge inside the dam and storing military supplies there. The dam across the Euphrates holds back Lake Assad. It is the largest lake in Syria, and is about 40 miles upstream from Raqqa. Both Russian and American air forces have refrained from striking at IS militants holed up in the al-Tabqah Dam for fear that damage to the dam could unleash catastrophic floods further downstream. IS militants in turn have threatened to blow up the dam in the event that Raqqa is attacked and overrun. At this point it is not clear whether the Syrian Army will bypass the dam or attempt to secure it before advancing on Raqqa.In the meantime, the US backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are advancing from the northwest toward Raqqa. The SDF is a coalition of Kurdish, Arab, Assyrian, Turkmen and Circassian militias. The militia force consists of approximately 25,000 fighters, of which roughly 5,000 to 6,000 are Sunni Arabs. The bulk of the force, and virtually all of its entire command leadership, is made up of Syrian Kurds. As of May 28, the SDF has advanced to a point about 24 miles from Raqqa. The militia is being supported by air forces of the US led coalition. US military advisors and forward air controllers are imbedded with SDF units, as are US Special Forces personnel. In addition, those Special Forces are also conducting their own independent operations against Islamic State targets.The US would like to see a more prominent Sunni Arab role in the liberation of Raqqa. It has attempted to recruit more Syrian Arabs to join the SDF. It has also had discussions with both Turkey and Saudi Arabia about their participation in the campaign. Turkey is in the best position to commit troops to the operation. Unlike previous discussions of a Turkish led intervention in support of the Free Syrian Army, Turkish participation in a campaign to seize Raqqa would be highly unlikely to precipitate Russian attacks against Turkish ground forces. Moreover, the US and its coalition partners are already committed to providing air cover to the ground force proceeding against Raqqa. Tabqah Dam with Lake Assad in the background. Turkish participation in the campaign, however, raises serious political issues for the Ankara government. The SDF is dominated by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG). The YPG is the military arm of the Syrian Kurd's Democratic Union Party (PYD). In turn the PYD is closely linked with Turkey's outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Both the US and Turkey have classified the PKK as a terrorist organization. For all practical purposes, Turkey is currently in a civil war with the PKK. Ankara does not see any difference between the PKK and the PYD/YPG. It has been pressuring Washington to brand both organizations as terrorists. The Turkish government is substantially correct in claiming that there is close cooperation between the military arm of the PKK and the YPG. Nonetheless, the United States is unwilling to brand one of its few remaining allies in Syria, and the one that has been the most militarily effective, as terrorists. The Turkish point was driven home this week when pictures appeared that showed American troops imbedded in the SDF wearing YPG insignia on their uniforms. The various military insignias worn by the YPG are all derived from the PKK's official flag. The Pentagon subsequently told American soldiers not to wear YPG insignias.From Ankara's standpoint, the success of the YPG led SDF in seizing Raqqa will further bolster the demand by Syrian Kurds for recognition of the semi-autonomous state of Rojava, which they announced earlier this year. An outcome that the Turkish government fears will only embolden Turkey's Kurds to demand more self-government, if not their own semi-autonomous state within Turkey. Conversely, Turkey's participation in the Battle for Raqqa would give it more influence in shaping the eventual outcome of the Syrian Civil War, but would force it to openly collaborate with an organization it has already branded as terrorist and which is openly aligned with another organization, the PKK, which is conducting insurgent attacks against the Turkish government. Persistent, though as of yet unconfirmed, reports that the PKK has been receiving weapons from Russia further complicates Ankara's political calculations. At one point earlier in the year, the Saudi's had signaled that they were open, either singly or in collaboration with the Gulf Cooperation Council, to supplying ground troops to participate in the Battle for Raqqa. Since then, however, Riyadh has not moved forward on the proposal. Riyadh's reluctance may reflect the fact that at the moment the Saudi's have their hands full dealing with the civil war in Yemen. It may also reflect Saudi dissatisfaction with the Obama White House's policies toward Tehran. For the United States, the Turkish-Kurdish political dynamic greatly complicates the conduct of the military campaign against the Islamic State. Turkey is after all a NATO ally and, given its geography and its close links to the Syrian rebels, will play a critical role in the eventual outcome of the Syrian Civil War. Turkey's continuing slide towards authoritarianism under its President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and its escalating civil war with its Kurdish population, further complicates Washington's relationship with Ankara. On the other hand, Washington is unwilling to disengage itself from the Kurdish YPG. From the US perspective they have been the only effective boots on the ground in Syria and their success lessens the pressure on Washington to commit more US ground troops to defeating Islamic State. Ankara wants Washington to choose between supporting Turkey and supporting the Syrian Kurds. That is a choice that Washington cannot and does not want to make. In the meantime, both the PKK and the PYD/YPG have taken advantage of the Russian-American rivalry to secure weapons and aid, and to further advance the prospects for a semi-independent Rojava. The Kurds are rightly concerned that both Russia and the US are using them for their own ends, and that once they are no longer useful they will be abandoned. A legitimate concern given how often that theme has played out in Kurdish history.  Syrian Democratic ForcesFinally, the battle for Raqqa cannot help but become a proxy battle between Russia and the United States. If the Syrian Army succeeds in seizing Raqqa it will underscore the effectiveness of the Kremlin's intervention in Syria, further strengthen Moscow's call for a Russian-led, or at least co-led, campaign against Islamic State and other Islamic Jihadist groups, and further expose the failure of the Obama White House's foreign policy in Syria. A victory for the SDF would at least allow the Obama administration to declare that it is succeeding in defeating Islamic State and that it is doing so, unlike the Russian-led effort, while minimizing civilian deaths and collateral damage. Raqqa will eventually fall, although it is in no immediate danger of falling any time soon. In the meantime the complex, Byzantine political maneuvering that has underscored the military campaign and, which in part is shaping it, will continue unabated."

As an animal lover, however, I am so angered and saddened by a recent incident at the Cincinnati Zoo that I can't help but speak out. Piecing together various accounts, here's what happened: A 4-year-old boy crawled through a barrier and fell into a gorilla enclosure. Zookeepers quickly moved the 2 female gorillas into another area, but the 17-year old male gorilla was still inside. An eyewitness reported that the gorilla ""rushed toward the boy and led him by the arm through the water in the enclosure,"" and that he, ""seemed protective and only alarmed by all the screaming."" The boy was in the enclosure for 10 minutes with no injuries. The zoo president says, ""while Harambe didn't attack the child, the animal's size and strength posed a great danger."" The zoo's Dangerous Animal Response team felt a tranquilizer would have taken too long to take effect and so, with the boy between the gorilla's legs, they shot Harambe dead. The boy was taken to a hospital where he was determined to have sustained non-life-threatening but serious injuries.How did this happen in the first place? To reach the gorillas, the boy had to go under the safety rail, crawl through wires, and climb over the moat wall. According to one eyewitness, the boy's mother was ""tending to several other children"" when he slipped away. Unfortunately, this is far from the first time this type of thing has happened. In 2014, a 3-year-old boy at the Little Rock Zoo ""fell into"" the big cat exhibit after his grandfather put him up on the railing to see the cats. A zookeeper reported seeing a yellow jaguar with its jaws around the neck of the boy. In this case, the staff used a fire extinguisher to drive the cat back, lower a ladder, and rescue the boy. The boy was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Need more? Last year at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, a 2-year old boy fell into a cheetah exhibit. The boy's mother was ""holding him and another child"" over the railing when he fell in. Fortunately, they were able to get the boy out and the cheetah seemed more curious than anything.There have been many similar incidents at zoos over the years. I'm not a parent (unless you count my fur-kids), and I'm sure it's difficult to keep an eye on your child 24/7. But in each of these cases, had a parent been supervising, not to mention not doing anything incredibly stupid like standing the child up on a railing or other precarious spot, these incidents would never have occurred. I spend time photographing zoo animals, and almost every time I visit I see exactly this kind of insanity.Regardless of how you feel about whether zoos should exist, they do, and a large part of their income comes from families with children. Instead of blaming parents or zookeepers, what about coming up with a solution? Here's mine, and it has two parts: First, any family with a child that is seen up on a railing or other precarious area must be escorted out of the zoo immediately. Highly visible signage around the zoo should warn them this will happen. Second, there are harness/leash combinations that are specifically designed for children. Children of a certain age and below should be required to wear one while on zoo grounds. This would prevent this sort of tragedy from ever happening again. It would also prevent children from running into other visitors (something I have experienced quite often) and from getting lost.The death of Harambe, a western lowland gorilla -- a critically endangered species -- could have easily been prevented. So could many other similar incidents. Let's learn from this heartbreaking tragedy and change things so it can't happen again.Nicole Wilde is a canine behavior specialist and author.

Those schools were Rose City Park, where about 550 students from first to eighth grade attend classes, and Creston School, a K-8 school with about 400 students.In both buildings, between six and eight water fountains and sinks had lead levels higher than the maximum amount that the Environmental Protection Agency allows. Some of those levels were double the allowable amount of 15 parts per billion, the Oregonian reports.The district initially told the news outlet that they immediately cut off the water supply to those fixtures when they got the test results. However, Smith later admitted that the school did not cut off the water supply -- or warn people about the lead -- while they were repairing the fixtures. That meant that at Rose City Park, students, teachers and staff were using the water as usual for eight school days after the district had the test results, the Oregonian reports. It's unclear how long students at Creston continued to have access to lead-tainted water. Portland Public Schools did not immediately return a request for comment from The Huffington Post.The school district plans to test schools across the district over the summer. In the meantime, Rose City Park and Creston will use bottled water for drinking and food preparation.The schools will also use disposable plates and utensils, to avoid having to use lead-tainted water for dishwashing.Though lead poisoning can affect anyone, children under six and pregnant women are especially at risk. The EPA warns that even low levels of lead in the blood can cause learning and behavior problems, anemia, hearing issues and slowed growth in young children. In adults, lead exposure can also cause problems like high blood pressure, reproductive issues and decreased kidney function."

Just a month ago, the British paper defended ExxonMobil's right to question climate change amid legal probes into whether the oil giant covered up evidence of global warming.But in an editorial published Saturday, the FT urged the oil industry to ""face a future of slow and steady decline.""""Instead of railing against climate policies, or paying them lip-service while quietly defying them with investment decisions, the oil companies will serve their investors and society better if they accept the limits they face, and embrace a future of long-term decline,"" the editorial board wrote. The board criticized U.S. goliaths like Exxon and Chevron for denying the role fossil fuel emissions have in increasing global temperatures and changing longstanding climate patterns. At Exxon's shareholder meeting on Wednesday, investors rejected all but one proposal to increase transparency about the risks of climate change to its business. Last year, shareholders of BP, Royal Dutch Shell and the Norwegian state-owned Statoil all voted, nearly unanimously, in favor of similar resolutions.""In their public presentation, at least, the European groups including Shell and Total are more willing to face up to the threat of climate change than their US rivals,"" the board wrote. ""While accepting the conclusions of climate science, Exxon and Chevron stress the importance of energy security and affordability over reducing emissions.""The tone of the editorial shows a marked departure from that of one of the FT's chief rivals, The Wall Street Journal. Last December, the Rupert Murdoch-owned daily -- the biggest U.S. newspaper by circulation -- lambasted the historic climate treaty reached in Paris.“Forgive us for looking through the legacy of smoke, but if climate change really does imperil the Earth, and we doubt it does, nothing coming out of a gaggle of governments and the United Nations will save it,” the Journal's editorial board wrote.

Two were found not guilty.Some individual crimes committed under Operation Condor had already been the subject of previous trials.

The article below has been updated. We regret the error.Donald Trump reportedly took House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to task for pushing Social Security cuts, arguing during their private meeting earlier this month that the policy is both wrong and politically unwise, according to Bloomberg BusinessWeek.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee made the comments during a May 12 meeting with Ryan aimed at mending ties between the two top Republican leaders, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed source who was in the room. (Ryan has yet to endorse Trump.)“From a moral standpoint, I believe in it,” Trump said of maintaining Social Security benefits. “But you also have to get elected. And there’s no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ‘We’re going to cut your Social Security’ and the Democrat is saying, ‘We’re going to keep it and give you more.’ ”Trump’s professed opposition to cutting Social Security and Medicare has been both a hallmark of his campaign and one of his greatest departures from traditional conservative ideology. And Ryan, who repeatedly criticized Trump before the mogul effectively secured the GOP nomination, has made proposing dramatic reductions in the popular social insurance programs a defining feature of his congressional career.The report of Trump's remarks to Ryan suggest that the candidate's public opposition to cuts is not mere posturing, but stems from genuine policy beliefs and political calculations.It remains to be seen how congressional Republicans, who largely support plans to scale back benefits, will reconcile their views with Trump's.Many conservative House Republicans told The Huffington Post shortly after the May 12 meeting that that they were unconcerned about Trump’s public posture on the programs. Several members interpreted him as wanting to extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare solvency through some combination of the benefit cuts and other reforms that conservatives favor.House conservatives can be forgiven for thinking that Trump's staunch opposition to benefit cuts was flexible.Trump policy advisor Sam Clovis had already appeared to reverse course on May 11, indicating that Trump would be willing to consider cuts as president.And in a 2011 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump seemed to suggest that his opposition was based more on political considerations than so-called moral views.“Things have to be done, but it has to be done with both parties together,” Trump said at the time. “You can’t have the Republicans get too far ahead of this issue.”Trump also compared Social Security to a Ponzi scheme in his 2000 book ​The America We Deserve​, arguing that the program should be privatized and the retirement age raised.“It is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security,” said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a group that promotes benefits expansion. “He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it.”Social Security, the United States’ public retirement, disability and life insurance program, faces a funding gap beginning in 2034. Without congressional action to either raise the program’s revenues or scale back benefits there will be an across-the-board benefit cut of approximately 20 percent.The Democratic party has adopted steadily more progressive positions on Social Security in recent years, arguing not only that the shortfall should be closed entirely through revenue increases -- such as lifting the cap on earnings subject to Social Security taxes -- but also that benefits should be expanded to address a growing retirement income deficit.Both Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) support increasing benefits and have pledged that they will not cut the program.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
