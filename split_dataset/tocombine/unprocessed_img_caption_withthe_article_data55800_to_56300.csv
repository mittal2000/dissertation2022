One in central Kansas was estimated to be as much as a half-mile wide.On Wednesday, another 14 tornadoes were reported in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, where Reuters wrote storms snapped power lines and damaged railroad track.A tornado thought to be about a half-mile wide touched down Wednesday night near the northern Kansas town of Chapman. The funnel remained on the ground for more than an hour and a half, during which time it destroyed around 25 homes and flipped numerous cars. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.The National Weather Service later rated the Wednesday night tornado an EF4, with peak winds at around 180 mph.And on Thursday, yet another strong storm generated a reported 16 tornadoes across five states, forcing a brief evacuation of the Kansas City International Airport.One tornado in the southeast Texas town of Navasota also struck a state prison.

Leatherman, a coastal scientist who teaches at Florida International University, evaluates the nation’s beaches based on 50 hand-selected criteria. He scores everything from sand softness, air temperature and wave size to creature comforts, safety features and even two types of noise (transportation and crowds).His annual lists can be so powerful that when Hawaii’s Waimanalo Beach topped last year’s list, locals — and even Leatherman himself — worried the fame would ruin the quaint and quiet beach.Unsurprisingly, beaches in the Aloha State have dominated the top spot for thepast few years, and 2016 is no exception. But the east coast also makes a strong showing in the top 10. Florida takes up at least three spots — proving that the west coast might not actually be the best coast. If Dr. Beach’s rankings reveal anything, it’s that America’s shores are looking mighty fine.So, which sandy spots made the doctor’s short list this year?

7,THE WORLDPOST,Gang Rape Posted To Social Media Is Forcing Brazil To Confront Violence Against Women,"Cleuci de Oliveira, Latin America News Dispatch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/report-of-gang-rape-surfaced-on-social-media-shocks-brazil_us_57489146e4b03ede4414c68a,Police learned of the brutal crime after a video glorifying it surfaced on Twitter.,2016-05-27,"In this file photo, women take part in the ""Marcha das Vagabundas"" (Slutwalk) protest in Brasilia June 18, 2011. A video depicting the gang rape of a young woman has prompted a vigorous discussion here about sexism, violence against women and impunity in Brazil. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574896801200002500894bd2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRASÍLIA — Shortly after midnight on Wednesday, 20-year-old Michel Brasil da Silva uploaded a 30-second clip to Twitter, accompanied by the words: “They smashed the chick. Do you get it or do you not get it? lol”The clip showed an undressed, unconscious woman lying on a bare mattress. She was being filmed by two men, both fully dressed, who took turns manhandling and mocking her.“This one just got knocked up by 30 guys,” one of them says.“Check out the state she’s in. Bleeding,” says the other, directing the camera toward her visibly injured genitals. At one point, the man positioned his head next to the unresponsive woman’s buttocks, stuck out his tongue, and took a selfie.The footage set off a firestorm on social media and brought national attention to the reported gang-rape of a 16-year-old by as many as 33 men in Rio de Janeiro over the weekend — a crime the police had no knowledge of until social media users contacted them en masse.Rio de Janeiro’s Public Prosecutor’s Office had received some 800 tips within hours of the short clip and selfie going online, according to news site G1. By Wednesday evening, the Prosecutor’s Office had launched an investigation and said it had identified the victim. In herstatement to police, obtained by Brazilian magazine Veja, the minor said that she’d met up with Lucas Perdomo Duarte Santos, a 19-year-old classmate she’d been dating for three years, at his house around 1 a.m. on Saturday. They were alone, according to the victim.The next thing she remembers, she said, is waking up on Sunday. She was naked, drugged, and surrounded by 33 armed men, in a house she did not recognize.The acts recorded in the video occurred one day after the reported gang-rape of another teenager — a 17-year-old allegedly victimized by five teenagers she knew, in the northeastern state of Piauí.The confidence with which the Rio suspects boasted about what had just taken place, coupled with their decision to not only record, but disseminate, incriminating evidence, has prompted a vigorous discussion here about sexism, violence against women and impunity.“This case has rattled Brazilians,” said Vanessa Dios, a researcher at the Brasília-based feminist institute Anis. She added that the irrefutable visual proof has kept more familiar responses to rape cases in Brazil from taking hold, such as “I don’t think that’s what really happened,” and “the girl is probably exaggerating.”“Even so,” Dios said, “many people responded to the footage with justifications” that the victim had brought this on herself. “The day-to-day culture of codifying women’s bodies persists in Brazil. They are constantly given signals to what constitutes acceptable behavior. Among men, the notion that they are allowed to touch and grab women without permission endures.”By the time his Twitter account was suspended, Silva had already retweeted a deluge of replies to his uploaded video — a characteristic one being, “They wrecked that one’s body hahahahahahahahaha the train ripped her hard.” In response to those who told him to take the footage down, Silva wrote, “People see worst stuff in this [expletive] and don’t complain. Just because I posted the chick’s video they now wanna talk crap. [Expletive] it… The video stays. If it bothers you, don’t follow me.”Silva did not respond to several attempts to reach him by phone. A Facebook profile widely attributed to him by social media users who have attempted to crowdsource information about the crime has been taken offline.On Thursday, Cybercrime Police Department Sheriff Alessandro Thiers lodged a judicial request to have four suspects arrested, Veja reported. The magazine names them as Silva, the 20-year-old who uploaded the video, Marcelo Miranda da Cruz Corrêa, 18, who also circulated footage of the crime, Raphael Assis Duarte Belo, 41, who allegedly appeared in the clip and took a selfie with the victim’s body, and Santos, the victim’s romantic interest, whom police suspect of direct involvement in the gang-rape.“What we have in Brazil is a cultural stew of sexism and sexual violence,” Congressman Marcelo Freixo, president of the Human Rights Commission of Rio de Janeiro, said in a telephone interview. According to Freixo, Rio de Janeiro registered 4,725 rapes in 2014 — an average of 13 per day. “We can’t say that we live in a democratic country with rates of sexual violence like these,” Freixo said. “We’re talking about a city that’s about to host the Olympics.”Freixo on Wednesday accompanied the victim to her first medical exam since the attack. He later announced that the commission will monitor the investigation and make sure that the victim receives psychological support.“It’s a systemic issue, not confined to one economic class or the other,” he said, regarding rape cases across the country. “And there are politicians who get elected thanks to hate speech.”Though Freixo didn’t mention him by name, Congress Jair Balsonaro, who represents Rio, has built a reputation for spouting off avowedly anti-feminist and anti-LGBT comments. In 2014, Balsonaro told a fellow congresswoman that he’d never rape her because she didn’t deserve it. In April, he dedicated his vote in favor of impeaching now-suspended President Dilma Rousseff to her “boogeyman,” the colonel who oversaw the torture she endured as a young activist during Brazil’s dictatorship.Bolsonaro was the most-voted Rio de Janeiro candidate for congress in the 2014 election.On the same weekend that the Rio teenager was reportedly gang-raped, a 17-year-old girl was found bound and gagged in Bom Jesus, a city in the northern state of Piauí. The victim and the suspects — five teenage boys — knew each other, and socialized on the night of the attack. The crime in Piauí came almost a year to the day after a similar tragedy stunned the state: four teenage girls were gang-raped, beaten and thrown off a cliff. One of them died.But news of the Rio and Piauí crimes reverberated across social media on Thursday. On Twitter, the hashtag #EstuproNuncaMais (#RapeNeverAgain in English) trended worldwide. On Facebook, São Paulo-based artists Luciana Fernandes and Beatriz Rezende mobilized feminist circles and created Por Todas Elas (For All the Women, in English), a mass protest group with demonstrations now scheduled across five cities.On Thursday evening, in a Facebook page widely reported across Brazilian media to belong to the Rio victim, she wrote, “Thank you for everyone’s support. I had honestly expected that I’d be judged harshly.”This piece was originally published on the Latin America News Dispatch. "

The school of thought holds that sustainable economic growth is best achieved by reducing many forms of government intervention in the economy. In practice, that means encouraging the privatization of previously public services, the reduction of budget deficits and the opening up of economies to international competition and investment.Neoliberalism has been the guiding philosophy behind the reforms the IMF has imposed on the nations it lends to -- including Greece, where an intractable debt crisis has shaken Europe at its foundation. Now, the ideology is a hot topic in the U.S. presidential race, with populist candidates in both parties -- Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- capitalizing on a public backlash against neoliberal policies.(For those feeling the Bern, neoliberalism is a fancier way of saying what the Vermont senator often calls “establishment economics.”)Bernie supporters in particular will find a lot to like in the IMF researchers’ new paper.Its authors, Jonathan Ostry, Prakash Loungani and Davide Furceri, offer a damning indictment of two key tenets of the neoliberal agenda: fiscal consolidation, commonly known as “austerity,” and the free flow of capital between different countries. Surveying global data, they decide that the two policies produce “increased inequality” that ultimately “hurts the level and sustainability of growth.”The paper suggests a possible change of heart from the lender, especially after the intense controversy over austerity in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent global recession. The authors’ idea -- that austerity depresses demand and, implicitly, risks trapping countries in the very cycles of contraction and debt accumulation they seek to avoid -- is by now conventional wisdom among progressive economists in the U.S. and Europe.“I think it’s good that the IMF research department is recognizing what I have been writing about for more than 15 years,” said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.But experts warn that it is easy to overstate the significance of a paper from a few IMF researchers. The research does not represent an official change in philosophy at the powerful lender, to say nothing of an about-face in the terms of the loans it issues.Peter Doyle, an economist and former senior manager at the IMF who resigned from the lender in protest in 2012 over its handling of Greece, dismissed the paper as nothing more than “what three guys at the IMF think.”“This has no broad sanction. It has no status,” he said. “Three different guys might have produced a different article.”Even if one considers it significant that the IMF is even funding this kind of research, it is aimed at the wrong countries, according to Doyle. The paper’s advice is directed at developed nations, to which the IMF does not lend directly and over which it therefore has little influence.“Any person looking at this would say, ‘Who cares what the IMF says about the U.S.?’ But people care very greatly what it says about Greece, Iraq, Malawi -- these places where it holds real clout,” he said. “Perhaps it would be better to devote itself to that than to this self-congratulating stuff.”Doyle speculates that the IMF is comfortable permitting researchers to take a progressive stance on countries where its words matter little, in the hopes of “playing into this public relations thing.”“The liberal commentariat in the U.S. and Europe applaud them, and then the IMF goes back to doing something else behind closed doors,” Doyle said.Indeed, IMF economists have produced other work in recent years that has also delighted progressives.A June 2015 paper by IMF economists recognized a link between reducing economic inequality and promoting growth. And an October 2015 paper argued that reducing the gender pay gap was a key part of easing overall income inequality.Meanwhile, the institution’s lending arm has either actively promoted, or failed to prevent, austerity policies that have kept countries like Greece trapped in a vicious cycle of deflation and debt.For example, after demanding earlier this month that Germany and other European nations provide Greece with significant debt relief, the IMF settled on Wednesday for just assurances from those countries that they'd consider helping Greece in 2018.“That is the problem: The research does not change the policies,” Weisbrot said. “They should withdraw support from the austerity that is preventing Greece from recovering.”"

Its aim was to lay the groundwork for a transformation in the delivery of global humanitarian aid and mobilize the aid community to help end need worldwide, but observers say it fell well short of that goal.Twenty-three Syrian NGOs attended the summit. Syria Deeply spoke with a number of these NGOs, which operate across different sectors, including development, aid and women’s empowerment. They all expressed disappointment at how little the gathering helped the millions of Syrians who are trapped in a seemingly intractable conflict that has become a proxy war for regional and international powers – and resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths while forcing nearly 5 million people to abandon their homes.“World leaders were praising each other for their successes, instead of touching on their failures and finding ways to fix them,” said Assaad al-Achi, executive director of Baytna Syria, a Syrian NGO based in the Turkish border city of Gaziantep working to develop Syrian civil society.He said the 23 Syrian NGOs collectively decided to attend the summit after meeting several times beforehand. The consensus, he said, was that it would be better to attend the gathering to raise their concerns with world leaders than boycott it. However, Achi said that after attending a number of special sessions and roundtable meetings attended by senior national officials and representatives of international organizations, he had reconsidered his decision. “If I were asked again, I would say we should have boycotted it,” he said.Specifically, Achi said he was shocked at the lack of interest in Syria, especially during the high-level roundtables. “We keep hearing from the U.N. that Syria represents the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War II, so one would think Syria would be at the center of the first ever humanitarian summit, yet it was completely neglected.”The United Nations, he said, continues to propose unsustainable solutions for the Syrian crisis, including its recent aid airdrop solution for besieged areas, without seriously attempting to end the conflict that created the humanitarian catastrophe. “What the United Nations keeps missing is that there needs to be a sustainable solution to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Airdrops to besieged areas is not a sustainable solution,” he said.Dr. Maria al-Abdeh, executive director of Women Now for Development, an NGO working on women’s empowerment in Syria, also voted to attend the summit to highlight the international community’s neglect of women amid the conflict. Specifically, Abdeh wanted to highlight the Assad regime’s crimes against women, such as sexual violence and forced disappearances, which she says have seriously hampered women’s lives.She, too, said there was a notable lack of concrete discussion about Syria. “I had very low expectations of what could come out of the summit, but I attended and spoke as a Syrian woman nonetheless,” she said. “We have gotten used to going to meetings where organizers have no idea about what’s going on [on the ground in Syria] or propose the wrong solutions,” she said. “But what we saw [at the summit], for the first time in a very long time, was a dreadful silence about Syria.”Both Abdeh and Achi saw the summit as a waste of time and money. “It was a ridiculously lavish parade of vague achievements,” said Achi. “We attended the summit with very low expectations, and they [organizers] managed to lower them even further,” he added.U.N. officials have declined to disclose the total cost of the gathering and said a large portion of the budget was covered by the host government of Turkey.Fadi Hakim, coordinator at the Alliance for Syrian NGOs, was surprised by the lack of open dialogue on Syria at the summit. “There were no open discussions on issues; the entire affair consisted of rehearsed speeches praising the achievements of organizations and agencies,” he said.“It was evident that the Syrian issue was not a priority, nor was it addressed at the World Humanitarian Summit.

The absence of heads of states, political and economic leaders and executives of major international organizations just meant that the event will lead nowhere,” he said.However, Fadi conceded that the U.N. alone cannot be blamed for the Syrian quagmire, noting that the world body has no power if it is not supported by the political decisions of its member states, especially members of the Security Council.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

Work is going ahead on another part of the shield, in Poland.""If yesterday in those areas of Romania people simply did not know what it means to be in the cross-hairs, then today we will be forced to carry out certain measures to ensure our security,"" Putin told a joint news conference in Athens with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.""It will be the same case with Poland,"" he said.Putin did not specify what actions Russia would take, but he insisted that it was not making the first step, only responding to moves by Washington. ""We won't take any action until we see rockets in areas that neighbor us.""He said the argument that the project was needed to defend against Iran made no sense because an international deal had been reached to curb Tehran's nuclear program. The missiles that will form the shield can easily reach Russian cities, he said.""How can that not create a threat for us?"" Putin asked.He voiced frustration that Russia's complaints about the missile shield had not been heeded.""We've been repeating like a mantra that we will be forced to respond... Nobody wants to hear us. Nobody wants to conduct negotiations with us.""CRIMEA ISSUE CLOSEDPutin sounded a defiant note over Crimea, the Ukrainian region which Russia annexed in 2014. Moscow said it was acting on the will of the Crimean people, who voted to join Russia, but Western governments say it was an illegal land grab.""As far as Crimea is concerned, we consider this question is closed forever,"" Putin said. ""Russia will not conduct any discussions with anyone on this subject.""The Russian leader also touched on relations with Turkey, which have been toxic since the Turkish military shot down a Russian fighter jet near the Syrian-Turkish border last November. Ankara said the plane strayed into Turkish airspace, an allegation Moscow denies.Putin said he was ready to consider restoring relations with Ankara, but that would require a first step from Turkey, and so far there was no sign of that.Putin was asked about the South Stream project, a planned gas pipeline from Russia that would have gone under the Black Sea to Bulgaria and onwards to southern Europe.

Netherlands-based cartoonist Jean Gouders has a pretty clear, and powerful, vision.Across the globe, women and girls in developing countries spend an estimated 200 million hours every single day collecting water in areas where potable H2O isn’t available.That means they’re more susceptible to developing physical ailments such as spinal and neck issues. They’re also more likely to miss out on work and educational opportunities.When it comes to schooling, there’s a direct correlation between increased access to clean water and higher enrollment rates.Girls’ enrollment rates improve by more than 15 percent when they are provided with clean water and a toilet facility, according to UNICEF.Gouders was prompted to use his skills to shed light on the issue when the Cartoon Movement, a platform that publishes political cartoons, sought out illustrations on the topic of education and water.Gouders’ cartoon depicts two images of the same girl side by side. In the first panel, the young woman balances a jug on her head as she prepares to trek 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) to fetch water. In the neighboring image, she holds a stack of books on her head and stands next to a sign pointing her in the direction of school.The image was featured at the Women Deliver conference in Copenhagen this month, which focused on the health, well-being and rights of women and girls.Gouders told The Huffington Post that he hopes his image conveys that such “simple things” as a water tap, for example, can have a rippling effect when it comes to improving girls’ access to water and education. “It doesn’t always have to be huge projects.”Learn more about Jean Gouders' work here."

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Nashville.Spokespeople for Bieber, Skrillex and Universal had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Dienel said ""Sorry,"" which appears on Bieber's album ""Purpose"" and has more than 1.42 billion YouTube views, adopted the ""specific and unique characteristics of the female vocal riff"" from her song, sampling it for the first eight seconds of ""Sorry"" and several times thereafter.She said even The New York Times Magazine noted the riff's distinctiveness, when it praised Bieber's song for its ""cooing arpeggio that feels like a gentle breeze on your brain"" in a March 13 article titled ""25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going."" Bieber's song ranked No. 1.Dienel also said she reached out to Bieber to discuss a resolution, but he ""ignored"" her claims and refused to talk.The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including from profits generated by ""Sorry."" Dienel's ""Ring the Bell"" appeared on White Hinterland's album ""Baby.""It is common for well-known singers to be accused of stealing song ideas from other composers.Kanye West was sued last week for allegedly taking part of his 2013 song ""New Slaves"" from a 1969 song by a Hungarian rock singer. Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page face a June 14 trial over whether they stole opening chords for their 1971 song ""Stairway to Heaven"" from a 1967 instrumental.The Bieber case is Dienel v.

Tensions have been high since the North conducted a nuclear test in January and a space rocket launch in February, prompting a United Nations Security Council resolution in March tightening sanctions against the isolated state.North Korean fishing boats occasionally stray into South Korean waters. Over the years, navy vessels from both sides have traded fire in sometimes deadly incidents.In 2010, 46 South Korean sailors were killed when their ship sank in what the South says was a torpedo attack by the North. North Korea has denied responsibility.The two countries remain in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Pyongyang recently proposed military talks with Seoul, but the South dismissed the offer as ""a bogus peace offensive"" because it lacks a plan to end the North's nuclear program.(Reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Tony Munroe and Mark Trevelyan)"

But civic engagement organizations that work with Latinos are warning Democrats that they need to do more to secure their votes to win down-ballot races, even with a nominee at the top of the ticket who frequently says nasty things about them.Latinos are the fastest-growing group of voters in the country, according to the Pew Research Center. The number of eligible Hispanic voters has grown 17 percent since 2012, to 27.3 million eligible voters in 2016. While Trump said at a rally Wednesday that “the Hispanics are liking Donald Trump,” polling has shown the opposite. Just 9 percent of those polled had a “very” or “somewhat” favorable opinion of Trump in a recent poll of voters in battleground states. But Latino civic engagement groups warn that voters won’t automatically link the reality television star to other GOP candidates who are on the ballot.“Trump has the potential of being a motivating factor,"" said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the NALEO Education Fund, but ""people need to be informed that there’s more than just the presidency on the ballot.""“This is where voter mobilization, voter education, is so key,"" he added. ""If you want to get people to vote in down ballot races you have to invest resources in making sure people understand that, and what their choices are, and not just thinking that if they’re going to vote against Trump they’re going to get to the end of the ballot,” past the presidential candidates. Rafael Collazo, the national political director for the National Council of La Raza’s Action Fund, echoed Vargas’ concerns. “As much energy as there is, and as much commitment as there is in the work that we do around electoral organizing, there still is going to need to be investments made,” he said. “Rhetoric, and headlines, and the initial energy we’ve seen around naturalization and voter registration in the beginning of this year doesn’t mean anybody can take the Latino vote for granted.""Democrats would need to capture 30 additional seats to gain a majority in the House, which is a tall order considering they gained just 21 seats when now-President Barack Obama beat Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) by seven points in 2008. (And that was before Republicans captured a slew of state legislatures in 2010, helping them dominate the redistricting process that year, which in turn made it easier for them to win elections.) There are 32 districts with Republican incumbents listed on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “Red to Blue” program, which identifies promising candidates in races the committee believes can flip in November, within a broader pool of over 60 districts the DCCC is competing in this cycle. But “there are no new districts that magically came on our battlefield because of Donald Trump,” cautioned Meredith Kelly, the national press secretary for the DCCC.“The 2010 redistricting created a limit to districts that are at all competitive for Democrats,” she added. “It is just not an ever-expanding battlefield. There are certainly districts where we have known that we had the potential to be successful and that had some core Democratic elements, and Trump has allowed us to land some high-level, exciting recruits in those districts. But he’s by no means the only factor.”Those sorts of recruits include former Colorado state Sen. Gail Schwartz, who got into the race to unseat Republican Rep. Scott Tipton relatively late. Tipton, whose district is roughly a quarter Latino but who hasn’t faced a strong challenge in past election cycles, has said he would support Trump (though he “has not supported everything Donald Trump has said or done.”)“We’ve talked to Gail Schwartz in the past and local Democrats have urged her to run before,” Kelly said. “She sensed that opportunity and there’s a reason she got in this year, but it doesn’t mean Colorado’s 3rd didn’t always have some of those important elements that make them competitive for us.” Democrats hadn't mounted as strong a challenge to Tipton in the past, even with its high proportion of Latinos, but that is changing this year, with the potential for his oppenent to go hard on Tipton's Trump association. House Majority PAC, the super PAC backing Democrats, has reserved more than $130,000 worth of television ads in Grand Junction, and upped its investment in the Denver television market, to target Tipton and boost Schwartz.Other House Republicans who may be vulnerable have done more to distance themselves from Trump. Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, who has said he will not support the presumptive nominee, told CNN he was “grateful” that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has so far refrained from endorsing Trump. (Registered voters who are Latino make up 60 percent of Curbelo’s district.)California Reps. Steve Knight and David Valadao -- whose districts have 24 percent of registered voters who are Latino and 58 percent, respectively -- have so far held off on endorsing Trump. (Knight seems to be in denial that Trump is going to be his party’s nominee.)GOP Rep. Will Hurd (Texas) has said he won’t endorse Trump until he “shows he can respect women and minorities.” (Fifty-seven percent of registered voters in his district are Latino.) And Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado, who represents a district where Latinos comprise 20 percent of registered voters, has said Trump “needs to change his tone” toward women, minorities and veterans to earn his support. This gives the candidates wiggle room to eventually endorse Trump if he starts to talk about people of color and women in a less hostile manner, but it won't help them win over Latinos who fear Trump's policy positions.Other incumbents in potentially competitive districts haven’t been as hesitant about Trump. Jeff Denham, who represents a California district where over 27 percent of registered voters are Latino, has said he would support the Republican nominee. And Rep. Cresent Hardy (Nevada) has said that the businessman’s tone toward people of color doesn’t bother him. (Fifteen percent of registered voters in Hardy’s district are Latino.)Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is already setting up a shadow general election campaign infrastructure in states like Nevada, Florida and Colorado. But Latino-oriented organizations are frustrated that resources for their voter engagement efforts are scarce outside those states, though only a quarter of the Latino electorate lives in the traditional presidential battleground states.“I’ve been asked by funders, ‘Why are you spending your time in Texas and California? You should be working in Florida and Colorado and Nevada,’” said Vargas. “That’s where all the money is going, but half of my electorate lives in California and Texas,"" he said.""One of the reasons why we have such a challenge in Latino voter turnout is because those people are consistently ignored,"" he continued. ""We’re doing all we can on a shoestring budget, because we have virtually been abandoned by the funding community for our voter engagement work.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to include more specific information on the 60-plus districts the DCCC is competing in this cycle."

But new polling from The Huffington Post and YouGov demonstrates they have some work to do to get that message to voters.This presidential election year is the first without the full protections of the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA). In 2013, the Supreme Court issued a controversial 5-4 decision that struck down the VRA’s most powerful provision, Section 5, which required states with a history of discriminatory voting procedures to run any changes to their election laws by the Department of Justice or get approval in federal court before they could take effect.States like Texas and North Carolina that had previously been covered under Section 5 immediately passed new restrictions on voting, including strict voter identification laws, cutbacks to early voting and the elimination of same-day registration. For 17 states, this presidential election will be the first in which new voting restrictions are in effect, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.Republicans say the flood of new laws restricting voting access is meant to prevent voter fraud and to cut costs. (They sometimes slip up and say such laws will help them win elections.) Democrats counter those claims by pointing out that voter fraud is exceedingly rare and that such laws make it more difficult for racial and language minorities, low-income people, seniors, students, people with disabilities and other Democratic-leaning constituencies to register and vote.In response to these trends, the Democratic National Committee in the last few months has responded to nearly every high-profile Republican attempt to make voting less accessible. The committee has held press calls on Democratic-backed lawsuits against Wisconsin’s strict voter ID law, voting restrictions in North Carolina and cutbacks to voting sites for Arizona’s presidential primary. They have also held calls to tout Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s (D) executive order restoring voting rights to ex-offenders and a judicial order halting Kansas’ proof-of-citizenship requirement to register to vote.“We do use this as an opportunity to contrast our values, and our initiatives, and their values, and their tactics, of using election laws to make voting more difficult, said Pratt Wiley, the DNC’s national director of voter expansion. “We want to make sure that voters understand that even though there are new obstacles put in place, that Democrats are working legislatively, through legal channels as well as through our campaigns, to ensure that voters are equipped with the tools they need in order to successfully cast a ballot.”On Tuesday, Democratic members of Congress launched a new Voting Rights Caucus to push for a restoration of the Voting Rights Act and to fight back against restrictive voting laws. No Republicans have joined. (Democrats and a handful of Republicans have tried to get Congress’ GOP leadership to back efforts to get some states under federal pre-clearance, to no avail.)Despite these stepped-up engagement efforts, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll reveals that a significant chunk of U.S. adults don’t have fully formed opinions about which party is more committed to protecting the right to vote. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they trust Democrats more on voting rights, 32 percent said they trust Republicans more and 30 percent said they were not sure. Another poll question asked about cutbacks to early voting, since Republicans in states with GOP-controlled legislatures like Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Nebraska and Wisconsin have limited or tried to limit early voting hours and days. Twenty-three percent of respondents said eliminating early voting days and shortening the hours when people can vote is done as a cost-saving measure -- the oft-stated justification -- while 33 percent of respondents said such moves mainly done as an attempt to limit voting by minorities and low-income voters. Thirty-two percent of respondents said they don’t know enough to take a stance. There were other poll results that show Democrats need to do more to counter GOP talking points. They need to explain that voter fraud isn’t a reason to restrict access and that proof-of-citizenship requirements make it difficult for voters without birth certificates -- or certificates that don’t match their name -- to cast a ballot. When asked which they consider more important -- preventing voter fraud or making sure no one who is eligible to vote is prevented from doing so -- 53 percent of respondents chose the former and 39 percent chose the latter. And 68 percent said eligible voters should have to show proof of citizenship to vote, compared to 22 percent of respondents who said they should not.Just 3 percent of respondents said voting rights was one of their top two issues that is most important to them when choosing whom to vote for, illustrating that Democrats haven’t yet made voting rights a voting issue.It’s possible that a general election face-off between the GOP’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders) could clarify the distinctions between the parties on the issue. Clinton has advocated for automatic voter registration and called out states like Wisconsin for passing strict voter ID laws while Sen. Sanders (I-Vt. has introduced automatic voter registration bill and legislation that would make Election Day a national holiday. Trump, for his part, gave an unintelligible answer earlier this month to a question about whether he’d like to see laws changed to make voting easier. He said “you have places where people just walk in and vote,” which apparently is a problem, and that there’s a national epidemic of non-citizens voting.

Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) railed against a bill that's meant to alleviate Puerto Rico's debt at a May 26, 2016 news conference.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574758021200002500894a16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Two Democratic lawmakers are pretty livid about legislation that is meant to give Puerto Rico -- home to 3.5 million American citizens -- the power to restructure its $70 billion in debt. The House Natural Resources Committee passed the bill out of committee on Wednesday with strong Democratic support, but Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) plan to fight it. At a press conference on Thursday, the duo listed their grievances with the bill, protesting its establishment of an oversight board on which Republicans will have a majority vote. The Republican majority on the board could result in a vote against restructuring, they say. It could also lead to cuts across Puerto Rico’s health care system, schools and government agencies -- which have already been squeezed by the debt crisis. “Our goal here is not to stop something,"" Menendez said. ""It is to make something better, so that if you’re going to have a control board, we’d like it to be representative of the people of Puerto Rico to some degree.""Under the bill, Republican leaders would appoint four people to the seven-person board: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) would pick two, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would pick the other two. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and President Barack Obama would get one appointment each.The oversight board would have final say on the Puerto Rican government's proposals for handling the debt and making budgetary changes. Five of the seven board members must vote to approve a court-supervised debt restructuring process, while other budget decisions would only need four votes. That stipulation is what worries the two lawmakers. Menendez said there is still a chance to make tweaks to the bill, although it's heading to the House floor and appears to have enough Democratic support to get across the finish line.Menendez said he and “a series” of other senators in the Democratic caucus spoke up during their weekly lunch to tell their leaders that “these concerns need to be addressed.” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been one of the most outspoken critics of the bill in recent weeks. Gutierrez initially said he would “actively work among my Democratic colleagues in the House to defeat [the bill]” but later said he wants to “improve” it, citing wariness from within the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to back the legislation as is. But all signals from House Democratic leadership say otherwise. While she admits it's not the best bill, Pelosi says she plans to support it. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), ranking member on the House Committee on Natural Resources, also backed the bill, saying time was running out before Puerto Rico's July 1 deadline for a $2 billion debt payment.“When measured against a perfect bill, this legislation is inadequate,” Grijalva said during the committee markup. “When measured against the worsening crisis in Puerto Rico, this legislation is necessary.”But Gutierrez and Menendez don’t see it that way, arguing it would be better for Congress to take a little more time. “I think there’s leverage to get some of the problems with this bill improved and I don’t think it should be 'either take this or face Armageddon,'” Menendez said."

Cheeky is a tableware company that sells plastic and paper plates -- and for every item you buy, they donate a meal to people in need. “As I learned about the issue of hunger in America, it became alarming how few people were talking about it,” founder PJ Brice told the Huffington Post. “In one of the wealthiest countries in the world, fifty million Americans are food insecure? It’s hard to believe.”The company partners with Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks providing free food to families and individuals who need it. For every product bought from Cheeky -- say, a pack of paper plates -- the company donates the monetary equivalent of one meal to the organization.In the 18 months since its inception, Cheeky's given over 7 million meals. “There are lots of other causes that are incredible, but I can’t think of many more primary than hunger,"" Brice said. “If people are working full-time jobs and can’t afford to feed their families, this is a problem.”In New York, one in five people lining up for free food at pantries has a job. And the problem is nationwide: One in six Americans lives in a food insecure household. Brice thinks of Cheeky like a TOMS or Warby Parker: The buy-one, give-one model allows them to sell original products, while supporting an important cause.“Cheeky is about generating meals,” Brice said. “But it’s also about raising awareness.”The next step for Cheeky is a kids’ line, launching in the fall. The line will benefit No Kid Hungry, an organization that connects low-income kids to nutrition they need, like school breakfasts and summer meals. “If children can’t concentrate in the classroom because they haven’t eaten breakfast, that’s an issue,” Brice said.Brice’s ultimate goal, though, is to go beyond just donating to food organizations:“We want to change perceptions, and absolutely change behavior,” Brice said. “For instance, let people know how much food goes to waste and why. A vast amount of food in American fridges gets chucked out. We want to help educate and empower people, so they can make the right choices.” "

But that could be changing.,2016-05-26,Many Americans eat their lunch every day at their desk instead of taking a real break. And it's not helping us live healthier lives.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5745d97b130000d605382bc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What would you say are the defining characteristics of the American eater?If you look at our obesity rates, they'd suggest we’re mostly overeaters. But beyond that, the question is tougher.It’s not so much that we lack a U.S. food personality — if anything, we have multiple, conflicting ones. At the same time, more consumers are demanding that their food be “natural,” organic and GMO-free, even as Taco Bell sells record numbers of Doritos Locos tacos. We seem more interested in celebrity chefs, cooking shows and recipe videos than ever before, and yet we’re also spending a record amount of money eating out and ordering in.To address our nation’s diet-related concerns, it would seem necessary first to better understand what we eat, how we eat it and, of course, why.In her new book, Devoured: From Chicken Wings to Kale Smoothies — How What We Eat Defines Who We Are, Culinary Institute of America program director and food writer Sophie Egan digs into these questions.It turns out previous attempts to dissect our dietary schizophrenia have ignored some important pieces. Principal among those, Egan argues, are the ways in which Americans working longer hours than the rest of the industrialized world has impacted both their motivation — and ability — to make healthier food choices daily.So how do we go about resetting our workplaces, cafeterias and the norms they help instill to a healthier default? The Huffington Post recently spoke with Egan about the challenges ahead and the reasons for hope.What prompted you to explore this question of how we wound up with the food culture we have today?I’ve been working in food professionally for a number of years and was thinking about how powerful a mirror food is for who we are at a much deeper level. I was tired of hearing that in the U.S. we’re so diverse and are such a huge country that we don’t have anything we could identify as a national food culture. I felt like, well, what can be said? I dug into that question of who we are as eaters, these core values we have as Americans -- these are things we don’t even see sometimes because they’re so deeply ingrained in how we think.And that led you to this discussion of how the way we work impacts the way we eat. It almost seems so obvious now that I’m asking you about it, but we don’t really talk about that relationship. Why is that?It really comes down to a reframing of how we look at the root causes of our eating choices. We typically center those conversations around individual willpower or these character accusations, if you will: That Americans don’t cook because they’re lazy or we just follow whatever we saw on TV. But I would say work is a root cause. In addition to a lack of financial resources [being a factor for many people], another important root cause of some eating behaviors that maybe aren’t as healthy as people would like is lack of time. If we’re working more than we used to, something is falling by the wayside.What was stunning to me was seeing how technology has really blurred the lines between work and home for many people. This mindset of, well, if you can work, why wouldn’t you? Whether it’s on vacation, in the evenings or on weekends, all of it. So with the increase in the numbers of hours we’re spending working, we’re not focusing on food. We look at food as fuel. You squeeze in a sandwich if you have three minutes in between meetings, or grab a Kind bar when you’re racing to catch the subway in the morning. Eating is a secondary need as opposed to something people used to design their days around.And this starts in childhood. Kids in K-12 schools usually don’t have enough time to eat, so they’re scarfing down pizza or hot dogs or whatever is being served in their cafeteria in 10 minutes. By the time you’re in college, it’s a grab-and-go, grazing mentality. So you’re trained from an early age to see food as secondary. This is a huge cultural norm that’s very difficult to reverse.I’ve noticed that the “food as fuel” mindset is behind a lot of the marketing of Soylent and similar products. I tried one last year and thought it tasted just as joyless as you would think. Why is this sort of message at the heart of a lot of so-called “foods of the future” today?Culturally speaking, Soylent is a huge step backward. There’s this sense that we can take food and improve on it, to take what nature gave us and say there’s got to be a better way. A life-hacking approach. A Silicon Valley approach. But [AOL co-founder] Steve Case has this great quote that food is not something disrupting the disrupting you have to do.Soylent is an extreme, but I would say it represents a larger idea of reducing food to its nutrients. Food is so much more than that. It does nourish us and we need certain things to survive, but I hope that people are starting to realize that flavor and taste and joy are some of the greatest pleasures of life. I think in the U.S., we have a very related discomfort with leisure and with pleasure. It’s sort of unspoken that if you sit around and do nothing, you’re lazy and you’re lesser. I think similarly there’s this sense of taboo around pure enjoyment of taste and of eating food with other people. There’s also an element of purity to utilitarian foods like that. In the book, you make a strong case for food — whether it be a particular diet or the practice of going to brunch — as a sort of ""secular church."" Is that a hypothesis you held going into this, or did it develop along the way?I started with this question about the contradiction of why we’re willing to spend basically the whole day seeking out brunch when our typical mindset is to go to extreme lengths to minimize the time we spend obtaining, eating and cleaning up after food. So it was more of this question of what is so different about that. Very quickly, my research led me to this discovery about how different our weekday eating habits are from our weekend eating habits. We spend the least amount of time of any major developed country preparing and eating food. We’re hardwired in terms of that idea of efficiency.But looking back, it’s very clear weekends are about indulgence and treating yourself after a long, hard week. These are also some of the only times we aren’t as scheduled, though many families have soccer games and a million other activities too. Your book also discusses how Americans are so used to getting our food exactly the way we want it, and points out how companies are always pushing new flavors and innovations or “stunt foods” like Doritos Locos. How do you balance these trends with ideas that could push us in a healthier direction? The answer can’t be to go back to the “good ol' days,” right?This is a really tough question. It’s not just that we all should return to the old ways, because there’s clearly some innovation or new ways forward that should be welcomed. But what kinds of pieces from our past do we really want to resurrect?Everyone talks today about how people are paying more attention to food than ever before, but from a policy standpoint, a number of things are still missing. One is the amount of time in schools for lunch. I think, at a broad level, going forward what I’m hoping for is for us to collectively find ways to focus on food more. And what I mean by that is, if more employers could make the American lunch break the norm in office settings. I’ve heard of a handful of companies where they ring a cowbell and everyone knows to take a break. You can’t expect individual change in the midst of the same larger environment, not only the physical marketing environment, but the cultural environment. I’m calling for cultural change, and it has to come from the top down.I think the piece most worth resurrecting from the past would be teaching people to cook. You don’t have to call it home economics. But it should be painted as essential life skills. What if, in order to graduate from college you had to demonstrate that you knew how to cook an omelette so that you could feed yourself? If it was considered the same way as learning a language or riding a bike?We’ve outsourced the preparation of food to the professionals. Are we going to stop eating food that comes in packages? Of course not. But we would be wise to see for what it is the availability of real, whole foods and the power that comes with feeding yourself and preparing food yourself instead of being sort of over-reliant on new solutions.Are you optimistic that we're moving in the right direction, toward getting back into the kitchen and eating more “real” food? Or are we too set in our ways at this point?I am optimistic. I think our appreciation for novelty and innovation is a double-edged sword. We’re eating more foods from around the world than five years ago, which is a silver lining to how much more we’re eating out. But it’s really brought a world of flavors to the masses. It has tremendous potential for healthier eating habits, because some of those other cuisines taste amazing and happen to be good for you without being positioned as good for you. That’s the best way to go.I’m also optimistic about how much consumer awareness can change Big Food, and we’re seeing that in food companies removing artificial flavors and colorings, or antibiotics. Consumers’ collective demands are really starting to make change happen faster. I think in some ways we’re more empowered than ever before.It is only with this greater awareness that we can we collectively take more control over our food choices. And with that, we can celebrate the aspects of our food culture that we sometimes overlook, and change those aspects of our food culture that are hurting us so that we can end up with healthier, happier relationships with the food we eat.---Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

We seem more interested in celebrity chefs, cooking shows and recipe videos than ever before, and yet we’re also spending a record amount of money eating out and ordering in.To address our nation’s diet-related concerns, it would seem necessary first to better understand what we eat, how we eat it and, of course, why.In her new book, Devoured: From Chicken Wings to Kale Smoothies — How What We Eat Defines Who We Are, Culinary Institute of America program director and food writer Sophie Egan digs into these questions.It turns out previous attempts to dissect our dietary schizophrenia have ignored some important pieces. Principal among those, Egan argues, are the ways in which Americans working longer hours than the rest of the industrialized world has impacted both their motivation — and ability — to make healthier food choices daily.So how do we go about resetting our workplaces, cafeterias and the norms they help instill to a healthier default? The Huffington Post recently spoke with Egan about the challenges ahead and the reasons for hope.What prompted you to explore this question of how we wound up with the food culture we have today?I’ve been working in food professionally for a number of years and was thinking about how powerful a mirror food is for who we are at a much deeper level. I was tired of hearing that in the U.S. we’re so diverse and are such a huge country that we don’t have anything we could identify as a national food culture. I felt like, well, what can be said? I dug into that question of who we are as eaters, these core values we have as Americans -- these are things we don’t even see sometimes because they’re so deeply ingrained in how we think.And that led you to this discussion of how the way we work impacts the way we eat. It almost seems so obvious now that I’m asking you about it, but we don’t really talk about that relationship. Why is that?It really comes down to a reframing of how we look at the root causes of our eating choices. We typically center those conversations around individual willpower or these character accusations, if you will: That Americans don’t cook because they’re lazy or we just follow whatever we saw on TV. But I would say work is a root cause. In addition to a lack of financial resources [being a factor for many people], another important root cause of some eating behaviors that maybe aren’t as healthy as people would like is lack of time. If we’re working more than we used to, something is falling by the wayside.What was stunning to me was seeing how technology has really blurred the lines between work and home for many people. This mindset of, well, if you can work, why wouldn’t you? Whether it’s on vacation, in the evenings or on weekends, all of it. So with the increase in the numbers of hours we’re spending working, we’re not focusing on food. We look at food as fuel. You squeeze in a sandwich if you have three minutes in between meetings, or grab a Kind bar when you’re racing to catch the subway in the morning. Eating is a secondary need as opposed to something people used to design their days around.And this starts in childhood. Kids in K-12 schools usually don’t have enough time to eat, so they’re scarfing down pizza or hot dogs or whatever is being served in their cafeteria in 10 minutes. By the time you’re in college, it’s a grab-and-go, grazing mentality. So you’re trained from an early age to see food as secondary. This is a huge cultural norm that’s very difficult to reverse.I’ve noticed that the “food as fuel” mindset is behind a lot of the marketing of Soylent and similar products. I tried one last year and thought it tasted just as joyless as you would think. Why is this sort of message at the heart of a lot of so-called “foods of the future” today?Culturally speaking, Soylent is a huge step backward. There’s this sense that we can take food and improve on it, to take what nature gave us and say there’s got to be a better way. A life-hacking approach. A Silicon Valley approach. But [AOL co-founder] Steve Case has this great quote that food is not something disrupting the disrupting you have to do.Soylent is an extreme, but I would say it represents a larger idea of reducing food to its nutrients. Food is so much more than that. It does nourish us and we need certain things to survive, but I hope that people are starting to realize that flavor and taste and joy are some of the greatest pleasures of life. I think in the U.S., we have a very related discomfort with leisure and with pleasure. It’s sort of unspoken that if you sit around and do nothing, you’re lazy and you’re lesser. I think similarly there’s this sense of taboo around pure enjoyment of taste and of eating food with other people. There’s also an element of purity to utilitarian foods like that. In the book, you make a strong case for food — whether it be a particular diet or the practice of going to brunch — as a sort of ""secular church."" Is that a hypothesis you held going into this, or did it develop along the way?I started with this question about the contradiction of why we’re willing to spend basically the whole day seeking out brunch when our typical mindset is to go to extreme lengths to minimize the time we spend obtaining, eating and cleaning up after food. So it was more of this question of what is so different about that. Very quickly, my research led me to this discovery about how different our weekday eating habits are from our weekend eating habits. We spend the least amount of time of any major developed country preparing and eating food. We’re hardwired in terms of that idea of efficiency.But looking back, it’s very clear weekends are about indulgence and treating yourself after a long, hard week. These are also some of the only times we aren’t as scheduled, though many families have soccer games and a million other activities too. Your book also discusses how Americans are so used to getting our food exactly the way we want it, and points out how companies are always pushing new flavors and innovations or “stunt foods” like Doritos Locos. How do you balance these trends with ideas that could push us in a healthier direction? The answer can’t be to go back to the “good ol' days,” right?This is a really tough question. It’s not just that we all should return to the old ways, because there’s clearly some innovation or new ways forward that should be welcomed. But what kinds of pieces from our past do we really want to resurrect?Everyone talks today about how people are paying more attention to food than ever before, but from a policy standpoint, a number of things are still missing. One is the amount of time in schools for lunch. I think, at a broad level, going forward what I’m hoping for is for us to collectively find ways to focus on food more. And what I mean by that is, if more employers could make the American lunch break the norm in office settings. I’ve heard of a handful of companies where they ring a cowbell and everyone knows to take a break. You can’t expect individual change in the midst of the same larger environment, not only the physical marketing environment, but the cultural environment. I’m calling for cultural change, and it has to come from the top down.I think the piece most worth resurrecting from the past would be teaching people to cook. You don’t have to call it home economics. But it should be painted as essential life skills. What if, in order to graduate from college you had to demonstrate that you knew how to cook an omelette so that you could feed yourself? If it was considered the same way as learning a language or riding a bike?We’ve outsourced the preparation of food to the professionals. Are we going to stop eating food that comes in packages? Of course not. But we would be wise to see for what it is the availability of real, whole foods and the power that comes with feeding yourself and preparing food yourself instead of being sort of over-reliant on new solutions.Are you optimistic that we're moving in the right direction, toward getting back into the kitchen and eating more “real” food? Or are we too set in our ways at this point?I am optimistic. I think our appreciation for novelty and innovation is a double-edged sword. We’re eating more foods from around the world than five years ago, which is a silver lining to how much more we’re eating out. But it’s really brought a world of flavors to the masses. It has tremendous potential for healthier eating habits, because some of those other cuisines taste amazing and happen to be good for you without being positioned as good for you. That’s the best way to go.I’m also optimistic about how much consumer awareness can change Big Food, and we’re seeing that in food companies removing artificial flavors and colorings, or antibiotics. Consumers’ collective demands are really starting to make change happen faster. I think in some ways we’re more empowered than ever before.It is only with this greater awareness that we can we collectively take more control over our food choices. And with that, we can celebrate the aspects of our food culture that we sometimes overlook, and change those aspects of our food culture that are hurting us so that we can end up with healthier, happier relationships with the food we eat.---Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

Briles is suspended with intent to terminate, the college said in a statement.In March, a former student at Baylor brought a negligence lawsuit in federal court against the school, accusing it of acting callously and indifferently after she was raped by a Baylor football player.In a separate scandal, Baylor football player Sam Ukwuachu was sentenced last year by a Texas judge to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a fellow student in 2013.That incident raised questions about how Baylor investigates sexual assaults. The judge in the trial deemed the school's investigation so insufficient that he barred defense from citing it.Briles compiled 65-37 record at Baylor since becoming head coach in 2008.(Reporting by Lisa Maria Garza; Editing by Alden Bentley and Bill Trott)"
