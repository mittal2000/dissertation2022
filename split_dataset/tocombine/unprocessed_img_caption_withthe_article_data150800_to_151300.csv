She lives in Rome two months a year writing about ancient and modern Italy and in India during the winter as a volunteer for a community development organization.  I love Roma so much I live there two months a year. But one year, Roma morphed from lover to spouse, no longer striving to delight me. Suddenly, it was enough for the city to span the Tiber with bridges, illuminate the ruins and provide busses with bodies and backpacks oozing from both entrata and ustica doors. I did not have an ""ah ha"" moment, rather a series of moments that moved my passion for Roma to echoes of medieval bells and memories of riso gelato. It was good while it lasted. Then it was over. Maybe it was trying to exit the Pantheon while the entrance/exit area was closed by conquering armies of school groups, stampeding tourists, pickpockets and a guard huddled in his plastic chair looking at the only escape route, the oculus. I tried to show my sister Raphael's tomb, that touching monument still graced with fresh flowers, but all we saw were the backs of T-shirts. Was it the canned beans and the waiter's lyrical lies that he picked them himself? Maybe it was the group from Kansas trooping through Piazza Navona pointing at St. Agnes's church and calling it St. Peter's. Perhaps it was me, the same me who must flame with passion for some author, some artist, some beach, some strawberry, or feel like I am flailing in a black hole babbling over the boredom of it all. I declared a trial separation in this decade-long romance and hunkered down in my Rome apartment on a hill overlooking lines of laundry. I pretended I was in Naples.The next week, I left my neighborhood only twice and briefly. I walked down to St. Peters to see if Roma was having a party without me. The lines to enter the church were so weary, so long, I suspected Roma missed the quick slap of my sandals as I once breezed through security, the wait as brief as a ciao. I walked to Campo dei Fiori. The crowd was so dense, so raucous, I was convinced Roma missed my strolls around the Renaissance palazzos, the fountain and shadows of the brooding Bruno. Yes, Roma was pining for me, but he had changed. He would have to find another woman, one who could see beyond the crowds and into his eternal heart. I decided to blind date a new country and bought tickets to Spain that would shorten my Roman holiday by two weeks. Then T.J. called. ""Meet me in front of Santo Spirito - we'll have dinner."" Which front? Santa Spirito encompasses three city blocks. The church entrance, hospital entrance, the hall of the frescos in eternal restoration entrance, back door entrance - which? My affair with Roma was in the dust bin, and I no longer cared about celebrating my next birthday. Then there was T.J., with his engaging smile and warm ciao. He knew how to rekindle my passion - a small trattoria facing the Tiber that has been cooking food with love for more than seventy years. Everyone was speaking Italian. No cowboy hats, no cheap nasty shoes. The bresola was va bene, the pasta carbonara was molto bene, the panna cotta smooth as a Latin lover, and the limoncello was free.After dinner, T.J. suggested going to the fireworks at St. Peter's Square in celebration of the 500th anniversary of the Swiss Guards. Oh fireworks, oh sure. People spilling beer on my Italian shoes and kids throwing cherry bombs...Oh, T.J. Fireworks. Really! And you even brought your camera. How endearing. They sell fireworks postcards. You can download fireworks screensavers and ring tones.The night was balmy and St. Peters Square was crowded, but T.J. scoped out the perfect spot. To my right, I saw the molten glow of the church; to the left, a shadowy fountain; in front, an Egyptian obelisk that had been converted to Christianity with a cross on top. One star, a half moon and a white cloud hung like a stage drop behind the obelisk.The loud speaker crackled, T.J. translated the welcome senors and senoras, the ""This square has seen fireworks for more than 400 years to commemorate."" Then darkness and silence. An explosion of lights arching, dancing, dripping to a classical number heavy on the Glorias. Then more lights danced over the obelisk to the Hallelujah Chorus. Is this God when a war ends? T.J. tugged my arm. Are you okay, are you homesick? Oh. I'm crying. Here's why. I have renewed my vows with Roma. Walking home, the air grew cooler and softer, sweetened by flower markets on every corner. People greeted me, buena sera, as if I had dual citizenship like T.J. I turned from my apartment and walked back down the hill, down cobblestone streets shadowed by ancient palazzos, past fountains that had splashed on 2,000 years of footsteps, into the city filling me again with its mysterious beauty.Despite non-refundable plane tickets and flippy red dress for flamenco, I stood up Madrid."
2,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking Off the Cuff: Maybe the Best Way to Cook Peas,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-peas_us_5b9d496fe4b03a1dcc86514a,"With young early-summer peas, I can think of nothing better than a dinner of plain crushed peas.",2013-06-26,Crushed Peas Out Of The Food Processor And Ready To Cook,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d496f2400003100538788.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The easiest ways to cook freshly shelled peas are (1) to boil or steam them; and, much better and actually quicker, (2) to put them in a pan with butter, salt and very little water, cover the pan and cook until done: they steam in that bit of liquid plus their own juices -- which combine with the butter to form a light sauce. And with young early-summer peas that's about all you need to know (unless you want to get into the more elaborate à la française method, with little onions and bacon and strips of lettuce, which is one of the world's greatest dishes and well worth the effort).But this spring, during an exhilarating dinner at Jean-Georges in New York, Jackie and I learned that one additional step -- also simple -- can turn those plain butter-gilded peas into something new and even more wonderful: something with that same clear pea-and-butter-and-salt flavor, but with a whole new consistency, which the restaurant's executive chef, Mark Lapico, rightly described as almost like that of a riceless (and less creamy) risotto. That step is to crush the peas, roughly, before cooking them. Just put them in the food processor and pulse until most of the peas are broken up. For about two cups of raw shelled peas, this took me eight brief pulses, but let your eyes be your guide: A few should remain whole, most should be in halves or other pieces of various sizes and some should be finely chopped. You can do this a little while in advance, but the actual cooking takes almost no time and should be done at the last minute.To make my own clumsy approximation of the Jean-Georges dish, I put the peas in a pan that was wider than it was deep -- though using a really shallow skillet would carry the risk of peas flying across the room as you stir them -- and, over medium-high heat, added salt, one tablespoon of butter and two of water. When the water began to boil, I used a heat-proof silicone spatula (a spoon would be fine, of course) to stir constantly and fairly vigorously. This agitation created a light emulsion consisting of water, butter and the finest-chopped, almost pureed, peas; the larger pieces of pea were surrounded by this near-sauce. Hence the somewhat risotto-like feeling in the mouth. Once the water boiled, the cooking took about a minute; if your peas are more mature or starchier than mine were, it could take longer, in which case you'd want to guard against burning and might need to sprinkle in an extra few teaspoons of water to keep the mixture moist and risotto-like. At the very end, I stirred in another scrap of butter, still vigorously.We ate ours as a dish in itself, along with young carrots and crusty bread and butter, but this would be wonderful with a poached egg or two -- or of course as an accompaniment to a light meat or fish dish. Pretty soon, just a little later in the season when the peas can take longer cooking, I'll go back to the bacon-onion-lettuce method and will probably describe it in a future ""Cooking Off the Cuff."" But for now I can think of nothing much better than a dinner of plain crushed peas."

I am having a hard time believing this is New York harbor -- and that I am kayaking it. The water is as transparent as my bathtub at home, but a lot more challenging and choppy. And unlike my tub, the harbor and the Hudson River are cordoned off into security zones I am not allowed to explore.It's a couple of summers back, in early July, and three friends and I are determined to see the Statue of Liberty by sea. Not by ferry, though. We want to paddle there, and we've found an outfit, Manhattan Kayak Company, willing to guide us to Liberty Island from the Pier 66 boathouse, just west of 12th Ave. and 26th Street. None of us knows a spray skirt from a rudder -- only my wife's brother, Bill, has ever kayaked before -- but we're happy about our adventure and feel confident as we make the rounds of drugstores to buy up disposable CVS ""Sport"" cameras and boxes of Nature Valley Energy Bars.Paddling day dawns with an eerie smog that is like nothing I remember from growing up here. The newspaper blames forest fires in Quebec and at the top of the front page there's a warning from the New York City Department of Health to ""refrain from strenuous outdoor activities."" As it turns out, we've got even more pressing worries. We find out that, due to the ever-present threat of terrorism, there is a 150-yard ""Exclusionary Zone"" around Ellis and Liberty Islands. Manhattan Kayak founder Eric Stiller tells me that, the other day, when kayakers accidentally got too close, Army Black Hawk helicopters buzzed in out of nowhere and circled the little boats until they paddled off.""They'll be watching us today,"" warns Eric as we get fitted for lifejackets at the pier, and check out the Necky ""Amaruk"" two-man sea kayaks. I knock on the flank of the baby blue one that Bill and I will be piloting: solid plastic.It's time for our mission briefing. Eric and colleague, Ray Fusco, roll out an oversized map of New York City's rivers, bays, inlets, and islands. To get to the Statue of Liberty we will have to pull off a 10 nautical-mile round trip, while wrestling with two- and three-knot currents. ""The Indians called it 'Great Waters Constantly Moving,'"" says Stiller. ""Twice a day the Atlantic shoves salt water almost 100 miles up the Hudson."" What really worries me, although I don't say anything about it, is the information -- delivered in passing -- that Stiller used this harbor trip to train for his recent kayak circumnavigation of Australia. At first I think this has to be a joke, but nobody's laughing. And it's time to load up the boats.Pushing off from the dock, our Amaruk moves slowly at first, like a clownishly scaled-down version of the ocean-going ships that used to sail from here. When Bill barks at me from his seat directly behind, I realize our slow progress is because I'm drenching him with river water instead of digging in with my blades as I dip each down and backward.I can see this is not the Hudson that I knew as a kid -- a swirling mass of yellow bubbles, empty boxes of Cracker Jacks, and bobbing bottles and cans. I don't see any fish, but according to Stiller, shad and striped bass started coming back after the Federal Clean Water Act of 1976, and someone he knows is trying to grow oysters by hanging a net off one of the Manhattan piers. As we bounce around, trying to get used to the chop, I am staring into the haze to see if I can get a look at our famous destination. ""There she is!,"" shouts Fusco, who is leading the flotilla. When I follow his finger, I can just make out a sculptural smudge in the direction of Jersey City.Fusco herds us expertly, like seagoing broncos, and we buck and wobble south past Manhattan's Chelsea Pier. Five avenues east into Manhattan, I find the turreted brick building where I grew up. Once, when I left the city aboard a ship, my mom waved goodbye by flapping a red-white-and-blue sweater from up there.Fusco is yelling orders all of a sudden, and we turn to see a Circle Line ferry bearing down hard to starboard. We've got the right of way, but sometimes boats can't see kayaks and we paddle furiously toward shore. It misses us, but we get the wake, full blast, and as I'm shaking water off my sunglasses, and out of my ears, my friends, John and Adam, are laughing in their kayaks just behind.We're at the place where we will have to power across the busy Hudson to New Jersey, and I am impressed to find that my partner, Bill, is ready. ""Fifteen strips of bacon,"" he keeps saying, referring, I guess, to breakfast, and the bacon must be working since we are moving fast.Fusco instructs us to aim for Jersey's Lackawanna Ferry Terminal, but we can barely see the thing, and now we are keenly concerned with other boats. Fighting the current, our kayaks snake between garbage barges, tugboats, sailboats, cigarette boats, another Circle Line, and, looming out of the smog, a ghost-pale cruise ship: the Nordic Empress. Making it to the Jersey side of the river gives us a sense of accomplishment and since we're out of the two-lane nautical highway, we take a break. Our CVS cameras come out for snapshots of the Manhattan skyline just across the water. There is the Woolworth Building. Here is City Hall. And right at the tip, near Battery Park, the Staten Island Ferry steaming for port.Fusco is worried that the Hudson's mighty tides may turn against us if we don't push on. That would mean not making it to the Statue, so we stash our snacks and grab paddles again. We reach Ellis Island, but I'm distracted by blobs of sunscreen that are melting off my forehead and blurring my eyes. And here are the ""Restricted Area"" buoys we were promised, keeping us back, with an insignia that reminds me of the 1960s Civil Defense signs that used to point out bomb shelters in Cold War New York. We are coming close now. I am eager, and my strokes are getting splashier and even less efficient as my forearms tire. I can hear Bill grunting, paddling harder to make up for this, and then, out of the blue, all of our kayaks pull up short. There is the pointed crown, suddenly clear of smog. And Liberty's torch reaching and stretching higher than I had ever remembered. We are low, and the sea-green statue is glowing with sun, staring down and beyond our knot of boats, clutching its tablet, thinking quiet copper thoughts. And we say nothing. This is not the Liberty we all knew from ferries and from spiraling up the staircase inside. It is as if we'd discovered her ourselves, finding an artistic shape in some wild and remarkable place. In the middle of a field. Or sticking out of a large tract of sand.It is time for congratulations. We try to arrange the kayaks to allow everyone to shake hands. I chug down a Ginger Ale I've been saving in my spray skirt, and one of the guides, Theresa, yanks out her bilge pump and fires off a couple of festive rounds. For a second, with these salvos of water, it feels like a holiday.The flame of Liberty's torch is gold leaf, and as we paddle around to the south and then the west side of the island, it is a bright and perfect focus of our arc. At one point Bill and I are in-between buoys and forget about the restricted zone until Fusco yells. We have not gone far into it, but Fusco is frantically pointing at the Coast Guard cutter Bainbridge Island which is anchored nearby.We hear Fusco's command ""Paddle back--hard!"" and as we struggle and tug our blades, we can just make out white-uniformed officers and a mounted machine gun on the cutter deck. A US Park Police boat comes screaming out of the haze on our port side, and for a second we are sure it's coming for us. But Adam and John are pointing back at Liberty Island and something near the shore. It's a motorboat that's whizzed way past the buoys and gone all the way in there. The US Park Police take only seconds to get to it, and as we paddle away, we keep turning back to see what the cops will do. ""Yep, they're being arrested,"" reports Fusco, who has sharp eyes. ""And now they're towing the boat.""Bill and I feel lucky not to be a part of this, and we are paddling harder and harder, churning north, leaving the statue and the buoys behind. A breeze kicks up to escort us up past Ellis and along the Jersey coast, and like a wand, it changes the Hudson into fat and lazy swells.No one is talking much, because the water is making us work. And because the skyline is clear now, catching the first red edge of evening and spreading it out from sharp piers to ships along the shore. Finally, as we move across the Hudson, it tints our tiny kayaks in alien colors not yet named by man.I think of Eric Stiller paddling here, pushing for Australia, and break into a grin. My arms and shoulders know that I have exploded my kayaking limit, and that I'll have to leave that adventure to Bill with future record-breaking breakfasts of bacon for fuel. But we have made it to Liberty, and that is enough. We have done it in the teeth of barges and cruise ships, despite coast guard cutters and police boats and forest fire air. And as I search for a turreted building five avenues deep within the city, I am aware of one thing. That, if my nautical mom were still alive, she would be watching from her terrace, scanning the river to pick out our plastic flecks of blue and orange and green. She would be watching as we floated our slow way home along the coast of Manhattan and slipped into our pier. And that is what we do: bumping the plastic Amaruks against the dock, hauling ourselves out, and stumbling as we try to get used to land. We've been paddling the Hudson, we keep telling ourselves, and already this seems strange as we get beat out for a taxi on 23rd Street and get on a bus. We are debating our New York dinner, but Adam has solved it.""Anyone,"" he says, ""for local fish?""* * * Manhattan Kayak Company* * *  Peter Mandel is an author of picture books for kids, including his read-aloud bestseller:  Jackhammer Sam (Macmillan/Roaring Brook), and his newest about zoo animals passing on a very noisy sneeze: Zoo Ah-Choooo (Holiday House)."

Just two minutes from the Alexandria Metro, a short drive from the capital city he helped found, The George Washington Masonic Memorial is a great stop on a DC tour.The design of the building is said to mimics the lighthouse at the other Alexandria, the Egyptian city where that wonder of the ancient world once stood. On the expansive grounds, you can clearly see the symbol of the Freemasons carved into the lawn.Proceeding up the wide stone steps into the lobby, it is clear you are entering a museum, with the requisite bronze statue of great man gazing over the lobby. However, a closer look shows that Washington is wearing an iconic symbol of Freemason dress - the apron he wore to lay the cornerstone of the capital - a truly iconic example of a spiritual mason doing the physical mason's work. On the walls, classical portraits depict famous Freemasons. The lobby features a small bookstore with Freemasonry memorabilia and a good book collection of interest to both Washington enthusiasts and those whose tendencies lean towards the esoteric. Solomon's Builders: Freemasons, Founding Fathers and the Secrets of Washington D.C., for example, talks about the hidden symbolism that appears throughout Washington DC's many original buildings , most of which can be viewed on a DC tour.Behind the bookstore's glass memorabilia case, a high level Freemason and retired docent rings up our purchases. He is full of useful information about the building and encourages us to take the inexpensive guided tour. Unfortunately, while we were happy to see the tour was was led by a young woman (the Freemasons have kept women successfully out of the ranks until recently) she was neither a Freemason nor a Washington expert, but rather a graduate student studying to become a museum curator , so her knowledge was limited to the information she had memorized for the tour. No matter - it was well worth the experience, as you get to see material otherwise not available to museum guests.The bottom floor of the museum contains is a room filled with colonial furniture, a replica of one of the first Freemason meeting spaces, and it includes a chair in which Washington actually sat. Upstairs, a large collection of George Washington's personal memorabilia features Freemason pieces he owned and a visual biography of the man's life. I was particularly struck by letters of diplomacy sent out to various groups: when writing to a minister, Washington referred to God; when correponding with a Native American chief, Washington talked in the same manner of the Great Spirit. This was a beautiful distinction, which showed not only the man's personal ability as a diplomat, but his deeper Freemason understanding of the Spirit behind of all things. It was a tremendous insight to see these letters side by side.On the top floors, Free mason regalia - including formal wear - and historical materials were collected, including information about a sister order to the Freemasons which was created entirely from a romantic novel of the early 20th century. Upon request, we were also shown a separate floor with memorabilia from the Knights of the Templar, including stunning stained-glass windows which depicted the order.Our final stop was to the observatory on the top floor, which features exterior walkways showing us a 360° view of the Potomac River, Washington, and Alexandria. Looking across at the majestic buildings of the nation's capital, it seemed that Washington would have been proud of his legacy - the tall buildings reaching for higher purpose, as Washington himself had done.Join a high-level Freemason in Washington DC to explore the George Washington Masonic Memorial and many other buildings full of hidden symbolism on an Esoteric America DC tour this September."
