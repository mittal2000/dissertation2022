Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" host John Dickerson had asked Clinton whether she would pledge to refrain from running such ads. ""I want this to be about ideas and about policies,"" she said. ""I know Bernie. I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas. That's what I want this campaign to be about, and I hope people who support me respect that."" For Clinton, it was a rare mention of Sanders' name. In the past, she has consistently avoided uttering his name when asked whether he posed a serious threat to her candidacy. She has suggested she would draw contrasts between herself and Sanders during the first Democratic presidential debate in October, and has stuck to criticizing her Republican counterparts. Clinton's comments came after a super PAC closely affiliated with her campaign, called Correct the Record, sent an email to The Huffington Post last week making comparisons between Sanders and some of the more controversial comments made by Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the United Kingdom's Labour Party, in order to suggest that Sanders is too extreme to win the nomination. Clinton also told Dickerson that her campaign was not preparing for Vice President Joe Biden to enter the primary. She leads Sanders nationally, but he is at the top of polls of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, which are the first two states to hold caucuses and primaries. "

Chris Christie (R) argued on Sunday that the pope was “wrong” to promote the recent restoration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba.""I just think the pope is wrong,"" the Republican presidential hopeful told CNN's Jake Tapper. “The fact is that his infallibility is on religious matters, not on political ones.”""I just happen to disagree with the pope on this one,"" added Christie, who is Catholic. In particular, he noted that the Cuban government granted political asylum to Joanne Chesimard, who was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in the 1970s and has since changed her name to Assata Shakur.“The fact is that, for me, I just believe that, when you have a government that is harboring fugitives, murdering fugitives, like Joanne Chesimard, who murdered a state policeman in New Jersey in cold blood, was broken out of prison, and has been harbored for the last 40-plus years by a Cuban government that has paid her and held up her as a hero, that this president could extend diplomatic relations with that country without getting her returned so she can serve the prison sentence that she was sentenced to by a jury of her peers in New Jersey is outrageous,” Christie said.Pope Francis, who is currently visiting Cuba before heading to the U.S. on Tuesday, played a key role in encouraging leaders from both countries to end a decades-long standoff and open up diplomatic relations. Last year, he wrote letters to both President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro, inviting them to “resolve humanitarian questions of common interest.” Earlier this year, both countries reopened embassies in each other's capitals and the State Department announced plans to allow more Americans to visit Cuba.In August, when Kerry presided over the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana, Christie blasted the decision. He also called for Chesimard, one of America’s most wanted fugitives, to return to the U.S.On Sunday, one of Christie’s presidential rivals, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), also weighed in, saying “I have no problem with the pope,” though he did not specifically address the pontiff’s role in restoring U.S.-Cuban relations.“On the economic issues, the geopolitical issues, the pope is just trying to bring people together. That's his role as a spiritual leader. And I respect that very much,” Rubio said on ABC’s “This Week.”Rubio, whose parents are from Cuba, added that he would like Francis to meet with Cuban political dissidents on his visit and hopes that he “will discuss human rights and freedoms” in his remarks to the public.In preparation for Francis’ visit, the Cuban government cracked down on dissident groups. On Sunday, Cuban police arrested several dissidents who were trying to approach the pope."

With Xi almost guaranteed another seven more years in power, Obama and his successor will both need to wrestle with China-U.S. relations in the age of Xi.

The prosecution of powerful officials (many who happen to be Xi’s political rivals) and the detention of civil rights lawyers have shocked China-watchers in their audacity and depth. Some scholars argue that the twin crackdowns reveal Xi’s vision for China’s future: not a liberal, electoral democracy, but an efficient authoritarian state with a strong leader at the helm.Abroad, Xi has asserted China’s contentious territorial claims by building artificial islands in the South China Sea. Over the objection of the United States and its allies, China has managed to build airstrips and outposts in waters also claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam. Xi has also expanded Chinese influence in Southeast and Central Asia by founding new international organizations and pledging huge money for infrastructure investments abroad.Reformer?Those stances have built popularity and political capital that Xi may spend on broad-ranging economic and environmental reforms. In 2013 the Chinese leadership announced its intention to kick-start sputtering economic reforms, shrinking the role of the state by giving market forces a “decisive role” in the economy.Those reforms are meant to power the Chinese economy through a tough transition: away from traditional sources of growth (cheap exports and heavy industry) and toward a new economy built on services, consumption and innovation.That’s a monumental task, and so far the record on reform is mixed. Early progress was made on thorny issues of restructuring local government debt and wrenching the Chinese economy away from high-polluting industries such as steel and cement.Sudden drops in Chinese coal consumption also laid the groundwork for last fall’s landmark climate change agreement with the U.S.But this summer, the government fumbled on several fronts.

6,THE WORLDPOST,Greece Votes In Its Second Election Of 2015,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greece-election-2015-tsipras_us_55f9857ee4b0b48f67017075,Polls indicate a tight race going into the vote.,2015-09-20,Former Greek prime minister and leader of leftist Syriza party Alexis Tsipras arrives to vote for the general elections.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586bfb7d1500002300916f67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Greek voters may be feeling déjà vu Sunday as they head to the polls to cast their ballots in the country's second election and third national vote of this year. The two previous votes, the first of which brought former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party to power in January and the second of which rejected a proposed bailout deal, cast long shadows over today's election. Tsipras' Syriza party is vying for reelection after a rebellion from members opposing the international bailout split the party in July. Tsipras resigned in August to pave the way for snap elections, hoping to consolidate his power after the schism with a new victory.There were reports of low turnout in the early hours of the election. At one polling station in Athens, the pace was slow, and some who came out to vote there voiced a general sense of fatigue with the state of Greek politics.""What is the point in voting for either one of the big parties?"" 35-year-old Nikos, who gave no last name out of privacy concerns, told The WorldPost. ""They both are going to compete over who will be the one to surrender the country to the bailout already agreed to with the lenders.""He claims he voted blank in protest.Syriza held a dominant lead over the next-largest party, the center-right New Democracy, at the beginning of the campaign but has since seen its support fall to similar levels. Polls showed the two parties in a tight race on Friday.The winner in either case will most likely need to form a coalition government with one or more of the many smaller parties that are also in play. Those include Popular Unity, the new hard-left party formed by former Syriza members, the centrist To Potami party and the anti-immigration, extreme right Golden Dawn.The dominant issue of the campaign has been Greece's dire economy and the government's handling of the multi-billion dollar bailout deal with European creditors, which the country accepted in exchange for imposing harsh austerity measures.Syriza was first elected in January on a wave of anti-austerity sentiment that opposed previous bailouts. But the party reversed tack and gave in to creditors' demands when faced with bankruptcy and the prospect of exit from the eurozone if it did not comply.Despite Syriza's about-face on austerity, many Greeks still see the party as their best option. ""I voted Syriza like the last time,"" 50-year-old Maria told The WorldPost in Athens.""I trust that although they had to strike a very difficult agreement with the lenders, they will try to improve the terms for the whole of society. They are the only ones that care enough to do it."" The financial chaos in Greece over months of torturous bailout negotiations took its toll on the already devastated economy, causing a massive flight of capital out of Greek banks and leading to the imposition of capital controls restricting the flow of money in the country. Businesses and average Greeks, especially the elderly, suffered heavily. At stake in the election is Greece's habitually uncertain future. Whichever party manages to form a government will be faced with significant challenges. Unemployment is at around 25 percent -- with youth unemployment double that -- and there is still a lengthy list of reforms to be passed in order to fulfill the nation's bailout agreement. Creditors have demanded large-scale pension reform, among other changes, and have set targets for Greece to start producing budget surpluses starting in 2016. The first review of Greece's bailout reforms is set for October, after which the nation and its creditors can work toward debt restructuring talks. An election result that leaves Greece in a state of uncertainty over which party can form a government may delay and complicate the implementation of the reforms agreed with creditors -- potentially leading the country into further economic turmoil. Danae Leivada contributed to this report from Athens.More on Greece's crucial vote:Also on HuffPost:"
7,ENTERTAINMENT,This College Student Just Questioned Donald Trump About His Stance On Muslim Americans,"Samantha-Jo Roth, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-college-student_us_55febacfe4b0fde8b0ce99a0,"""I think our president should stand up against things like Islamophobia, not support it.""",2015-09-20,"Lily Nellans, 19, confronted Donald Trump with a question about his stance on Muslim Americans at an Iowa rally.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fee5e520000025002429fa.jpeg?ops=crop_0_101_600_336%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"URBANDALE, Iowa -- As a throng of millennials with selfie sticks in hand crowded around the entrance of Urbandale High School, where Donald Trump would be emerging for his most recent rally, a college student made her way to the front of the stage, ensuring that she would have the opportunity to ask the real estate mogul a question. This was Trump’s first public appearance after the Republican presidential candidate declined to correct a man who said at a New Hampshire rally on Thursday that President Barack Obama was a Muslim and that Muslim Americans were a ""problem.""Trump, appearing on a stage at the local high school alongside the student body president and the homecoming king and queen, didn’t address the controversy in his stump speech, but instead sought to give the crowd of students -- clad in their homecoming dresses and suits -- some advice, telling them to “stay away from alcohol, drugs and cigarettes” and to “do what you love.” After speaking for about 20 minutes, Trump answered questions from the crowd. Lily Nellans, 19, raised her hand, and soon a woman in a Trump T-shirt brought the microphone over to her. “So I consider Muslim Americans to be an important asset to our country and society,” Nellans said. “Would you consider putting one on your cabinet or even on your ticket?”“Oh, absolutely, no problem,” Trump said after some back and forth with Nellans, not hearing the correct question initially. “OK?”“Great,” Nellans responded, shrugging her shoulders with disappointment.As the event came to an end, and the crowd flocked to Trump in the hopes of shaking his hand and posing for photos, the Des Moines native walked in the opposite direction. “I wish he would have done more,” Nellans told The Huffington Post. “I wish he would have stood up for the contributions Muslim Americans make and took a stand against the racism that other of his supporters have put forward at events such as this.”The sophomore at Western Kentucky University is studying international affairs, philosophy and Arabic. She even spent the summer in Bosnia, taking classes in genocide studies, peace building and security. She said she was hoping for a real answer to her question.“I think he just didn’t want to make it an issue, didn’t want any sound bites from answering too much,” Nellans said. Nellans attended the rally with her father. She said she was appalled listening to how Trump responded to a New Hampshire voter this week, and knew she had to attend his next event, which happened to be close to her hometown. “I think our president should stand up against things like Islamophobia, not support it,” she said. “I wouldn’t have had a problem with him talking about how we are going to combat fundamentalism or ISIS, but the first things out of his mouth should have been, ‘Our president is a citizen, and he is a Christian and even if he were a Muslim, that would be OK.”“They are not a problem, they are an asset,” Nellans added.While the college student said she was impressed that Urbandale High School was able to host a major candidate on its campus, she was disappointed overall with the content of Trump’s speech. “What his message was up there, was ‘I’ve been successful, I’m great, you should look up to me, and that’s why I should be president,’” she said.This motivated teenager said she wants to work in human rights advocacy and eventually run for public office. She thinks a policy-based approach on a lower scale would have made for a much more insightful Trump rally.“This was a self-promotion event,” she said, “not an event to really connect with the voters and get his message out.”"

The real estate mogul called in to ""Meet The Press"" Sunday morning to address the ongoing controversy that followed his lack of response after a supporter asked Trump how he would address ""a problem in this country ... called Muslims."" Host Chuck Todd used the line of question to turn to another tea party stumping point: that the president isn't a U.S. citizen.Trump refused to share his current views on the factually inaccurate sentiment, instead telling Todd he just doesn't like talking about it and ""won't talk about it.""""I just don't discuss it,"" the candidate said. ""Really, it hasn't been brought up in a long time."" Trump is actually one of the forefathers of the Obama birther conspiracy. He made headlines in 2011 after persistently demanding to see the president's birth certificate while raising doubts over Obama's birthplace in Hawaii. Even after the White House released an official copy of the document, Trump questioned its authenticity.Sunday's exchange comes just days after Trump ignited controversy by nodding along at a campaign event while a supporter linked the notion that the president was Muslim with his belief that all Muslims ""have training camps growing where they want to kill us.""Todd also asked Trump how he'd feel should a Muslim president actually be elected down the road -- not a far-fetched idea, as the population of Muslim Americans is expected to surpass 6.2 million by 2030. Trump's response wasn't terribly shocking.""Would I be comfortable? I don’t know if we have to address it right now,"" he said. ""But I think it is certainly something that could happen.""Todd reiterated his question before Trump interrupted:""I mean, some people have said it already happened, frankly,"" Trump said, presumably referring to Obama. ""But of course you wouldn’t agree with that.""Todd continued to press Trump on whether he believed Obama was Christian but the candidate said he didn't ""talk about people's faith"" and added that he was ""willing to take [the president] at his word.""Despite his reluctance to address an individual's faith, the candidate made a point to note that he ""love[s] the Muslims"" and thinks ""they're great people"" during a stop at a high school homecoming Saturday night. He gave Todd a similar one-liner before reversing himself to say he believes there is, in fact, a problem there. ""I feel strongly that Muslims are excellent. I know so many Muslims that are such fabulous people,"" he told Todd. ""But there is a problem. I mean, there's no question about it. And we can be politically correct and we can say there is no problem whatsoever. But the fact is there is a problem with some. And it's a very severe problem."" Also on HuffPost:"
9,RELIGION,Shaman Explains How Ayahuasca Can Facilitate A Spiritual Awakening,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ayahuasca-information-shaman_us_55f8a179e4b0b48f670121a7,"There's a lot more to learn about this powerful, psychoactive brew that's gaining popularity in North America.",2015-09-20,<em>Psychotria viridis </em>leaves commonly used to brew ayahuasca.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f8a97d1c00002d0075717a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ayahuasca has been used in religious ceremonies for centuries. Called the ""vine of the soul,"" ayahuasca is a brew typically made from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and Psychotria viridis leaves that grow predominantly in Brazil, Peru and other regions of South America. The resulting tea contains DMT, which the Drug Enforcement Administration classifies as an illegal hallucinogen, despite its long history of use in religious rituals. Ayahuasca is frequently referred to as a ""medicine"" and has been used by shamans in South America for centuries, though it has only garnered popular awareness in North America in recent decades. On Sept. 25, dozens of doctors, researchers, spiritual teachers and artists will converge in Los Angeles for a three-day conference to discuss the use of ayahuasca and other psychoactive plants for spiritual healing and personal growth.The Visionary Convergence, as the event is titled, aims to bring awareness to the growing interest in “entheogenic plants,” defined by Oxford dictionary as “a chemical substance, typically of plant origin, that is ingested to produce a non-ordinary state of consciousness for religious or spiritual purposes.” This interest is starting to have legal, cultural and academic effects in the U.S. In 2006 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Uniao do Vegetal or UDV church had the right to exist -- and to drink ayahuasca during its services. Ayahuasca is also appearing as a topic of one of the workshops at the Parliament of the World's Religions, a major international interfaith conference taking place in Salt Lake City this October.The Los Angeles conference will address these and other repercussions of ayahuasca's rapidly growing popularity in North America. Sitaramaya, who goes by Sita, is the organizer of the Visionary Convergence and spoke with The Huffington Post about her experience with the powerful entheogenic brew. A Los Angeles-based shaman trained in the Peruvian Shipibo tradition, Sita is also the director of the Capital Case Project, an organization that advocates for people on death row.Note: Ayahuasca can have dangerous and even fatal results when not brewed properly or administered with proper care. Sita stressed that it is a powerful, psychoactive substance that practitioners should use only in a ceremonial setting under the careful guidance of a shaman.HP: How did you first encounter ayahuasca and what effect did it have on you?Sita: I got sober from drugs and alcohol when I was 25 years old and started a yoga practice at the time. I was introduced to the concept of ayahuasca through my yoga teacher in 1996, and I was pretty staunchly opposed to drug use. But there was a kindred feeling between myself and my yoga teacher, and when I witnessed my teacher I thought, ‘Wow, this teacher is walking the walk.’ There was a disconnect between what I thought drugs were and what I was witnessing and what I was learning.I had to sit with it for a year. I practiced and I sat with it and then I thought, ‘I’m feeling really drawn to this.’ Then it was another year before I got the opportunity, and I took it. My first ceremony was in 1998. My life changed after that. Ayahuasca didn’t change my life but my life changed as a result of that initial experience.Descriptions of the effects of ayahuasca range from ""an oceanic feeling of connectedness"" to ""feeling as though one is dying."" How would you describe the plant and the experience of drinking it?Words really fail us here. It’s like trying to understand some esoteric teaching, but it’s just an approximation because it’s not something that’s really knowable. Ayahuasca is a deeply personal, individual and, very frequently, spiritual experience. Much of how we experience drinking ayahuasca is influenced by the setting in which we drink, who and how we are physically, emotionally, spiritually, psychically, and intellectually when we drink. I can speak to my observations and experience of drinking ayahuasca in the Peruvian Shipibo lineage that ayahuasca calls forth within us that which needs or desires to be cleared, cleaned, healed, aligned, transformed or expanded. The experience is one of a shift in perspective and perception. It can be retrospective, introspective. It can be the most challenging experience you have ever had or divine bliss. It has been said that it is like dreaming while awake and I would agree with that.Do you personally find ayahuasca ceremony to be a spiritual experience?For me it’s a very deeply spiritual process. To try and capture the ineffable is ridiculous but for many of us it’s irresistible. My motivation in these endeavors is a quest for meaning and also a surrender to that which we are not going to be able to know. The spiritual part of that experience is unfolding some of the source of creation and then we know that there exists what can’t be known.Can you share some examples from ceremonies you’ve been in?I once had an experience in an ayahuasca ceremony of these sheets of light unfolding repeatedly. It was as if in the seam of each one was a light that I experienced as all that is, but then it would fold back again. I came to this place of understanding -- we can keep going but there’s nothing behind that screen. You could pull back that curtain but it would just be another curtain. It never ends. We are that, born into human form. I believe that it’s our soul taking form to know the divine within.Another experience I had many years ago in Brazil happened after I did a 28-day dieta (a process of developing and cultivating a relationship with a particular plant while restricting intake of other foods and substances.) Midway through I had a vision of a crystalline palace up on a mountain top with tiers leading up to it. Those tiers represented the suffering of the universe: fire, floods, dismembered bodies. I cried and cried and cried with this deep spiritual connection I felt to all the hurt. The palace represented everything is divine. We all get to go to that palace but some of us are doing it with a limb hanging off our body. It was so moving. I felt just very deep compassion and connection, and for me that’s very spiritual.What is your aim for the Visionary Convergence?From a broad spectrum approach it is to cultivate entheogenic awareness. ‘Entheo’ means ‘of god,’ so ‘entheogenic’ is something that allows us to know god within ourselves. Many people believe, as do I, that certain plants are opportunities to do that. Our hope is to cultivate awareness and to really think about how we want to define medicine in the 21st century and how entheogenic plants will play a part in that. We’re bringing together people from multiple disciplines to really open up this conversation. What I hope is we come out of it with more questions than we do answers.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Watch Sita deliver an ""ayahuasca monologue"" below:Also on HuffPost:"

John Conyers wants to  force the Federal Reserve to focus more on job growth.,2015-09-19,"Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), accompanied by demonstrators with the umbrella group Fed Up, speaks outside of the Federal Reserve in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015. Conyers introduced legislation on Thursday require the Fed to target lower unemployment. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve may not have raised its benchmark interest rate on Thursday, but advocates of full employment still worry it could do so before the economy is ready. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), a senior House progressive, introduced a bill that same day that would make a future rate increase dependent on much lower unemployment than the U.S. is likely to achieve anytime soon.Conyers’ proposed Full Employment Federal Reserve Act would obligate the Fed to define full employment as a maximum unemployment rate of 4 percent and “a labor market in which median wages are rising with worker productivity, job seekers can find work, and involuntary part-time work is at a minimum.” Short of meeting those criteria, the Fed would be unable to raise its influential interest rates.“It is unacceptable for any branch of our government to take any action to slow our economy before all Americans have the opportunity to experience the jobs recovery and see meaningful wage growth,” Conyers said in a statement.Conyers’ bill has six original co-sponsors -- all members of the Full Employment Caucus, a group of House members devoted to full employment policies. It has the backing of the Economic Policy Institute and the Center for Economic and Policy Research, two Washington-based liberal think tanks.Unemployment now is officially 5.1 percent, a level that falls within the Fed’s full employment target. The central bank is prepared to raise interest rates with this level of joblessness, but did not on Thursday because of concerns that an economic slowdown in China and a drop in oil prices will depress inflation. The Fed has a dual mandate to enact monetary policy that promotes both full employment and stable prices. The two-pronged mission, established by Congress in 1977, does not specify how the central bank should define those goals.Critics of the Fed, mostly liberal, have said top Fed officials have used this discretion in recent decades to prioritize concerns about excessive inflation over maximizing employment. The choice is essentially zero sum: When the Fed increases interest rates to limit inflation, it does so by deliberately reducing economic demand, which reduces potential job growth. Long before the financial market volatility that began in late August, these economists and activists opposed an interest rate hike, saying the official unemployment rate fails to account for people working part time involuntarily, or those who have given up looking for work.Progressive pressure on the Fed to prioritize full employment has escalated in the past year with the launch of the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of groups led by the Center for Popular Democracy. Fed Up has mobilized low-income workers and people of color to lobby Fed officials against an interest rate hike and to make the central bank more accountable to the broader public. Conyers joined Fed Up activists demonstrating on Thursday outside of the downtown Washington offices where Fed Chair Janet Yellen later held a press conference on the decision to maintain current interest rates."

Lattin was arrested Friday on charges of making a false police report, the Whitney Police Department reported in a press release.The story began innocently enough. Lattin told Fox 4 he was the victim of vandalism on Sept. 8 because his family supports police. The Lattins had displayed blue and white ribbons on their picket fence at home, as well as the saying, ""Police lives matter"" on the back of their truck, in honor of fallen Deputy Darren Goforth, who was gunned down in Houston last month.Lattin said he found his vehicle torn to shreds, with $5,000 worth of damage done to it. But his downfall may have been his interview with Fox 4. In it, he told reporters that someone had ripped out his glove box and slashed his seats, damage that police didn't see when Lattin initially filed a police report.""We had initial video when the officers took the report and then when we saw your story on Channel 4,"" Whitney Police Chief Chris Bentley told the station. ""When we looked at those two videos, there were some differences in those and that led us to take the investigation into a different direction.""The chief also called the incident ""very disturbing,"" and asked supporters to stop sending the Lattin family money. Lattin had set up a GoFundMe account that reportedly reached nearly $6,000 in donations, though it appears the page has been taken down.Fox 4 cameras recorded Lattin's arrest, and the suspect denied the allegations.""Absolutely not true!"" he said.But according to an arrest affidavit, Lattin admitted to vandalizing his own truck for insurance purposes. Whitney police said additional charges are pending."
