Krugman and Niall Ferguson, author of 'The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World,' clashed anew today over how to revive the U.S. economy.

""The Fed grossly misunderstood the nature of the relationship between its statements and market expectations,"" the New York Times columnist explained in a harsh takedown of the central bank's actions over the past few weeks. Federal Reserve President Ben Bernanke said in June that the Fed would likely slow the pace of its bond purchasing program, also known as ""quantitative easing,"" later this year. This announcement caused the bond market to panic and sent interest rates on a wild ride. As The Huffington Post's Mark Gongloff pointed out earlier this week, ""it seems clear that Bernanke and the Fed had no idea just how much the market would freak out about their plan."" Unfortunately, the volatile market has led to an increase in borrowing costs, which, as Gongloff warned, ""could smother the recent rebound in the housing market.""Some say this kind of market activity is normal. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said in a speech Friday that the markets would likely remain volatile while policy makers debate how to wind down its stimulus program, according to Bloomberg. But Krugman argued that ""the Fed was foolish here."" While the economy is showing some bright spots, talk of an end to the stimulus poses a big threat to the recovering economy, which is still plagued by high unemployment, Krugman wrote.Of course, the market's response wasn't much of a surprise to Krugman. The Nobel Prize-winning economist warned that the Fed's talk of tapering could ""end up looking like a historic mistake"" earlier this month.  "

But let's just say that my day at KVIFF proved that you could travel around the world in a single day without ever leaving the festival's central building. The films I saw took me to Saudi Arabia, the Czech Republic, the backwoods of Louisiana, Israel, what appeared to England (though the film itself was from Estonia), and the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee. Talk about global whiplash.Unfortunately, the best two films of the day were also the first two: Honeymoon, a Czech film by Jan Hrebejk, and Wadjda, the first feature from Saudi Arabian director Haifaa al Mansour (apparently Saudi Arabia's first female director). Honeymoon deals with a couple whose wedding day is invaded by a stranger, who turns out to be part of the groom's past. Initially not recognized at the ceremony, he also crashes the reception at their family home. Even as the family assumes he must be some old friend, the groom (and bride) grow increasingly uneasy about what this stranger may or may not know.The film packs the same sort of creepy, visceral punch as Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration, as well as David Hare's Wetherby. With a strong, attractive cast and lush exteriors, Hrebejk keeps things intimate and low-key, right up until the explosive reveal and its even more shocking aftermath. It's the perfect movie for people who hate big family events because of people's tendency to get loose-lipped about the past while under the influence.In Wadjda, al Mansour uses the story of a spirited young girl to explore the cruel reality of life for women in the society of this repressive Islamic culture. Waad Mohammad plays the title character, who looks to be about 12 and lives with her mother, a teacher. But her mother has to don a burka to leave the house -- and Wadjda herself gets in trouble at school regularly for forgetting to cover her head and for wearing sneakers under her abaya. She's smart, funny and feeling her oats, even though her teachers constantly do their best to snuff her sense of independence.The film centers on her dream of owning and riding a bicycle, even though women are theoretically forbidden to do so (they can't drive cars in Saudi Arabia). She starts saving her money for a green bike she sees at the local toy store -- then begins studying the Koran with a new vigor when she discovers that the prize money for a Koran competition at school will be enough to pay for it.Al Mansour is never heavy-handed in her depiction of women's second-class status in her country. Yet she makes her points, whether it's a group of schoolgirls forced to move inside from playing outdoors because workmen across the street can see them or the tentative nature of Wadjda's mother's marriage to her father, who is in the market for an additional wife. But at the center of the film is young Mohammed, who gives a natural, spunky and uplifting performance in a film that seems to hold out hope for change in this country (despite evidence to the contrary).By contrast, another film about faith and its role in daily life, Joseph Madmony's A Place in Heaven , took an interesting idea and ran it into the ground, dragging on and on. After a disjointed but promising beginning, it settles into its story: the life of a famous Israeli soldier who, early in his career (and mostly as a joke), trades his place in heaven for his favorite meal.This commentary continues on my website."

Through that awareness, we become more familiar with our ongoing mental habits.",2013-06-29,A woman doing yoga on the beach at sunset.More yoga images:,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d49a32000002d00fde85d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am on my way to a Mets game and my friend Ken asks, ""What is mindfulness?"" It's not an uncommon question for me. It's in my writing, my medical practice, the classes I lead, and my everyday life. So you'd think I'd have a pithy answer that perhaps would last less than the hour we'll be stuck in ballpark traffic, but I don't. Mindfulness has become harder and harder for me to define the more I know about it. I often say that if mindfulness seems odd or inaccessible, I've done a poor job explaining it. I generally start with Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn's definition, since he created the original mindfulness program in the 1970s. He has said mindfulness is ""paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment."" That sentence is accurate, but fails my Bronx test. If I ask any average person on the street what that means, I'd be at risk for a dismissive shrug. And who wants to be nonjudgmental anyway? Dr. Kabat-Zinn's definition starts the discussion, but does not necessarily reveal enough about tangible, day-to-day value. That's because mindfulness is a word trying to translate an experience, something common sense and accessible but not easy to encapsulate.Mindfulness: A Dictionary Definition Mindfulness According to Oxford:  The quality or state of being conscious or aware of somethingDr. Kabat-Zinn created his ""mindfulness-based stress reduction"" (MBSR) program to introduce centuries-old Buddhist concepts into the secular West. Mindfulness is not a spiritual practice unless you want it to be. Whether you're an intense business leader, an inner-city kid from Baltimore or living on a mountaintop in Tibet, mindfulness builds skills and perspectives that cultivate a larger sense of equilibrium around basic facts of life such as everything is always changing, nothing stands still, and uncertainty rules. The concept behind the entire MBSR program can be unintentionally misleading. Give us eight weeks and we can fix your stress problem. It can sound very... advertising driven. As any MBSR teacher would say, in reality stress is going to continue whatever we do. And even when your stress level does improve (as research suggests it may), MBSR does not immediately alter anything for some people or eliminate stress forever for anyone; it is not cure-all or a quick fix.The eight-week program is an introduction to a lifelong training. Stick to it, even when practice is difficult and not much seems to happen, and your experience changes. Mindfulness is more analogous to long term physical fitness than anything more immediate such as knee surgery or a dose of antibiotics.The Language of Mindfulness Mindfulness According to Grandma:  Learning how to ""be in the moment"" and familiar with what you are experiencing so that you become more focused and less reactive in your behavior.There's often confusion about the relationship between various related concepts such as ""mindfulness"" and ""mindfulness meditation"" and ""mindfulness-based stress reduction."" Are they all the same or different? Do they all depend on each other? If I take a mindfulness class do I have to sit quietly for hours on end and pretend to be happy about it? First, what is meditation? Mindfulness meditation is a particular type of meditation that breaks a habit. We all live much of life distracted and not quite paying attention to what's actually going on. We exist on autopilot, generally relying on habitual and often reactive behaviors. Through meditation we aim to build a capacity to attend fully to real life, as it is, for better or worse, without any escapism or striving for a totally still mind. Not only can you meditate if you have a busy mind, it's expected that you'll have one.How does the MBSR program relate to mindfulness? Dr. Kabat-Zinn's center has created guidelines for MBSR instruction, with the intention that only teachers following the plan call their classes by that name. To attend an MBSR class means someone follows this protocol. Many other programs and interventions formally or informally (but validly) integrate mindfulness.   Mindfulness refers to the whole package, a particular set of cognitive skills we develop that help manage our lives. Mindfulness doesn't require meditation, but it's built through meditation. It does not require a particular program. You can practice mindfulness at any time through the day, bringing your full attention to whatever you're doing, with a particular attitude of openness and acceptance (whatever that means). So mindfulness is not mindfulness based stress reduction is not meditation. Mindfulness is more than attention training.Mindfulness According to Siri:  The trait of staying aware  (of paying close attention) to your responsibilities.Stress results when real life does not fit our idea of what should be. Which might mean something as huge as ""I imagined I'd be in a happy marriage forever but now I'm getting divorced"" or as simple as ""I had my heart set on a cheeseburger but they are out of cheese."" Recently back from vacation we may feel particularly magnanimous, accept our disappointment, and move forward. After an awful night sleep and a fight with our boss the no-cheese experience causes a meltdown. A lot of the time, if not all the time, our perspective matters.When we discuss paying full attention to our immediate experience, it means not only to external forces (no cheese today) but all our internal chatter (this kind of thing always happens to me, what idiot failed to order cheese at a burger joint, my life sucks, why can't I be more mindful and accepting instead of getting angry again). We cannot expect to be happy in any situation, but we increase suffering when fueling our mental fires with self-recrimination (I shouldn't make such a big deal over a missing dairy product), rumination (if only I could stick to vegetarianism this kind of thing wouldn't happen to me), prognosticating (nothing will ever change) or any other common tinder. Mindfulness may be a proactive version of the traditional serenity prayer, without the God reference. Being open and curious means acknowledging the reality of the moment, however we feel, without excessive wrestling. Equanimity, a sense of peace and ease, often follows. May I develop for myself the ability to change the things I can, to accept the things I cannot, and the wisdom always to see the difference.   Mindfulness is a skill set.  Mindfulness According to Dr. G, Pediatrician/MBSR participant:  Mindfulness is a state where one accepts the past as unchangeable and the future as theoretical, where thoughts are just thoughts  and the present moment is all there is.So what is mindfulness already? Mindfulness is the ability to live life more fully aware of what's going on both around us and in our minds. Through that awareness, we become more familiar with our ongoing mental habits. That awareness increases our ability to pick and choose (without expecting total success) which ones to continue and from which we might step back at any moment. We also build a general trait of responsiveness over reactivity. We create a little more space between our experience (no cheese) and whatever we elect to do next. Or maybe for once we allow ourselves to do or say nothing at all, dropping any rumination, planning or compulsion to fix everything.  I'm disappointed, I don't have time to go elsewhere, what else can I order today?Putting our existence under a microscope is not the goal; we instead balance a more gentle focus with a measure of acceptance. We recognize our own cognitive tendencies without self-abuse. We cultivate a sense of compassion for ourselves and others, a recognition than once we pause and attend we may notice that we're all trying to find some peace and happiness in life, even when we appear to be making a mess of it. Mindfulness for a healthy brain.Mindfulness According to basketball coach Phil Jackson:  The trick is to experience each moment with a clear mind and open heart. When you do that, the game -- and life -- will take care of itself.I don't work out because I want stronger lungs or legs or arms in particular. I want my body as a whole to stay in shape. And I don't practice mindfulness because I expect better focus or less stress or more responsiveness in isolation. I support a general state of mental well-being through ongoing effort. That hopefully improves life not just for me, but for my family and anyone else who deals with me day to day.As a doctor trained in Western medicine, the science matters a lot to me. Among people practicing mindfulness studies have shown physical changes in the brain including ones potentially related to focus and emotional control. Other research reveals physical and psychological benefits. The brain is malleable, responding to our experience and whatever we mentally practice with concrete, physical growth. So if it clicks for you, feel free to define mindfulness as cognitive fitness training.   In a line or two then, what is mindfulness and why do it? Mindfulness is a word, and a less than perfect one at defining anything in particular. The concepts behind mindfulness matter far more.

Lately he's been embarking on some new journeys as an LGBT rights activist and the unofficial ""King of the Internet."" With over four million fans on Facebook and over 700,000 followers on Twitter, the beloved actor is a social media force to be reckoned with and he uses his magnificent reach to champion lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes. In honor of LGBT Pride Month, the Huffington Post caught up with Takei to chat about everything from his time on ""Star Trek"" to guest starring in a comic book with Archie Comics' first gay character to bringing his new musical to Broadway and more.The Huffington Post: You wrote a blog about Jodie Foster’s speech at the Golden Globes and how celebrities should come out. When celebrities (or anyone, really) talk about coming out they describe it as “liberating.” Did you find it that way? How did your life personally and professionally change once you came out? George Takei: I decided to come out to the press after then-Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed legislation granting marriage equality in California. I was outraged that he would cave to political pressures, but also inspired by the young people I saw demonstrating against his actions. In many ways, my decision to come out changed the course not only of my personal life, but of my professional one as well. As a visible spokesperson for equality, I was no longer simply ""that guy from Star Trek"" but one of the few out, and outspoken, gay actors of the time. It gained me an LGBT following I didn't formerly have, which together with my sci-fi base, formed a peculiar and wonderful combination. My ""nerdy and campy"" reputation grew from that.  Your musical “Allegiance,” about the Japanese American internment camps, had a successful run in San Diego and is now headed to Broadway. Did you think that it would be such a success? What do you think piques the audience's interest about this “forgotten” chapter of American history? It has long been a dream of mine that this important story one day would be told on the great American stage of Broadway. In fact, I've dedicated much of the latter half of my life to ensuring the story of the internment is known. I was one of the founders of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. Four years ago I met the creators of “Allegiance” -- Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione -- by complete chance at the theater. When I shared my story with them, I believed they could sense my passion for the subject. They came to Los Angeles and I took them on a tour of our museum, and, together, we embarked upon the development of the show. I never knew for certain that we would be able to bring the show to fruition, but we have moved forward as a team with a strong sense of historical imperative. Last fall, we completed a record-breaking out-of-town tryout at The Old Globe Theater (smashing its 77-year box-office record), and, now, we are steaming on to Broadway. It is exhilarating.I believe audiences connect with this story because it's a family story. Even though the characters have Asian faces, audiences of all backgrounds relate to their love for each other, their struggle, their triumphs. It's true that many audience members, especially those educated east of the Mississippi, have never heard about this part of our nation's history. But even those who are aware of it actually know very little beyond the mere fact that it happened. We like to say of ""Allegiance"" that it's ""The Story You Never Knew, The Family You'll Never Forget."" It is a privilege to help bring this story to light. It’s safe to say you’re one of the most popular celebrities on Facebook and Twitter. You’ve said you love social media -- you even write reviews on Amazon. What is it about social media that you love? Did you ever think that you would become such a celebrity in the online world, even to those who aren’t Trekkies? Social media affords me an opportunity to interact with fans on a daily basis, not just for a few seconds apiece at a science-fiction convention. I started posting online largely in the hope of bringing more attention to my musical ""Allegiance"" and also to spotlight some causes that are near and dear to my heart, such as LGBT rights and marriage equality. I discovered early on, however, that if I shared some material that I found funny, people came back for more. So the ""funnies"" became the reason the fan base grew. Was I surprised? Yes. I'm still astonished today at the numbers, but even more delighted that a whole generation of younger fans who never even saw me in the original “Star Trek” series can interact with me on such a familiar, casual level.What has been your most surprising encounter via social media? Most satisfying? One encounter that springs to mind is when I posted two pictures of actor Ed O'Neill holding a newspaper. Now, the first picture was from his ""Married… with Children"" series 20 years ago, and the second was from ""Modern Family"" airing today. The amazing thing, it was the same newspaper. The props department had been using that same paper -- identifiable by its headline -- for over 20 years. But, that wasn't the end of it. Ed took a picture of himself with an iPad showing my Facebook page, where I'd posted those side-by-side pictures of him. Fans were agog. Ed O'Neill reads GeorgeTakei's Facebook page -- and took a selfie to boot. It was like stepping into an alternate universe. It is the sort of epic thing the internet can do to connect people across time and context.  You are speaking at Elliott Masie’s Learning 2013 conference in Orlando in November, along with other speakers such as Hillary Clinton. The conference website says you will discuss how social media has changed storytelling. How do you think social media is influencing or aiding people who are considering coming out? Back in the day, coming out was something very personal. You began by acknowledging the truth, first to yourself, then to close family and friends. Those of us more in the public spotlight, though, also had to ""come out"" to the press. Today, with everyone so connected, once you are ""out,"" you are out to the world on places like Facebook, where, once something is shared, it is more or less permanent knowledge. So, today, the act of coming out is not only a personal step, it is far more a public step because of social media. Because of the internet, it is increasingly easier for LGBT people not to feel isolated, and to find other out friends or colleagues online. That inevitably makes the process a bit easier, because one can witness widespread acceptance, even if there is occasional rejection.This past December you were a guest star in the Archie Comics series, Kevin Keller, as his hero. How do you think Kevin Keller, the first openly gay Archie character, is changing the minds of kids and comic readers? I am proud to be a part of comic book history. For so long in media, kids have had very few positive role models of gay people. It matters to each new generation that there are folks who are active, participating, contributing members of our society - who happen to be gay. This knowledge helps young people understand that accepting who you are, and living the life you were meant to lead, does not condemn you to live on the margins, shunned by family or friends. Kids who might be of a different sexual orientation or gender identity know from a very early age that they are different from their peers. Giving them even one example where this is just fine, and where it's no big deal in the end, eases their path to their own acceptance.You’re the hero of Kevin Keller, a fictional high school student in the comics, but has the experience also been reflected in real life? Do a lot of young gay kids reach out to you? What do you say to them and what do you see as a main difference between gay kids of today and in the past? When I was a child growing up, I faced terrible discrimination on account of the fact that my family and I looked like the people who bombed Pearl Harbor. For that ""crime,"" my family and I were locked in two different internment camps for four years. I well understood the pain, and the consequence, of invidious prejudice and ignorance. At that time I also knew that my own sexuality was not something that I could reveal to others without serious consequences, both personal and professional. I kept it mostly hidden although over time I let a few close friends and family members know. My decision to go public, by talking to the press about being a gay Japanese American, occurred in 2005.I'm heartened to see many young people today able to come out proudly, with nary a bit of drama or pain. That, of course, isn't always the case, and it is still very hard for many to come to terms with their sexuality, whether out of fear of rejection, or the teachings of their particular religion. Just the other day on my Facebook page I shared the story of a high school senior couple, two boys, who were voted by their school as the ""cutest couple."" It wasn't a question of straight or gay, they were simply a delightful, beloved couple. That never would have been conceivable even 20 years ago, let alone the 60 years that have passed since I was a high school senior. I say to young people, the world is changing, and changing fast. And, for the better. Take heart in that, and be part of that change. It is making a difference.Aside from Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and videos with Conan O’Brien and Funny or Die, is there anything on the Internet that you would love to do that you haven’t done yet? The internet is always reinventing itself, offering new challenges and new methods of bringing people together. I rely on fans to bring me the latest and greatest. One thing I might like to add to the mix is a George Takei App. I'm not sure what it would do yet, but that would be rather nifty.With Zachary Quinto playing the character Spock in the new “Star Trek” movies and being an openly gay actor, did you ever consider coming out during your time in the original “Star Trek” series of TV shows and films? Did the “Star Trek” cast and crew know you were gay? Were they accepting? Some of the cast and creatives were aware that I was gay, and I did, on occasion, bring a male date to parties. “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry was aware of my sexual orientation and very supportive. That was the extraordinary thing about “Star Trek.” That we were a diverse crew of people representing so many colors, backgrounds and heritages. That was the promise of the future. And, now, in the J.J. Abrams reboot, an openly gay actor is playing a Vulcan in love with an African American. I'm not really surprised by this. “Star Trek” taught us to look ahead to a time where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream was fulfilled. Being a part of that vision was -- and has remained -- a tremendous honor.For more on George Takei, visit his official website, Facebook page and follow him on Twitter."

The incendiary religious group will picket the boy band's July 19 concert in Kansas City, Mo., citing a verse from Genesis as justification. The group added the following message to its online picket schedule.WBC will picket this perverted pop boy band from the UK who claim to be the world's #1 band. Indeed, they are a perfect representation of this filthy world and the sin-chasing, fag-enabling, God-hating, Christ-rejecting UK who has banned WBC from preaching within her borders. These freaks and their fans think it's funny for these five perverts to grab each other's asses on stage. They glamorize sin and make a mock of God's standards. Their one purpose is to encourage the youth of this generation to pursue every lust their evil hearts can imagine.But Westboro didn't stop there. As if disrupting the concert isn't enough, the group has parodied one of the band's songs, replacing the lyrics of ""One Thing"" with words about obeying God's orders. One Direction's victimization was announced right after that of Swift, whom the group called a ""whore."" "

The New York Post reports that the mayor's office has revoked the rapper's permit, with an anonymous police source citing concern over the holiday weekend's potential ""fireworks and terrorism.""Jay-Z will indeed be granted the opportunity to perform atop the famed Ed Sullivan Theater marquee, near New York City's Times Square. The July 8 concert has been given the go-ahead by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who in 2010 stopped the rapper from hosting a stint with Eminem on the marquee. The duo moved their set to the building's roof, but now the home of ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" will host Jay-Z in his proper glory. In order to host the concert, New York officials will have to shut down part of Broadway near the theater, between West 53rd and 54th streets, according to the New York Post. Jay-Z joins the ranks of Phish and Paul McCartney, both of whom have rocked out on the marquee.The Ed Sullivan performance comes in conjunction with Jay-Z's appearance on ""The Late Show"" and his ongoing marketing campaign for upcoming album ""Magna Carta Holy Grail,"" which will be released four days prior to the concert. The rapper has unveiled one promotional material after the next, including lyrics to songs, behind-the-scenes promos and, most recently, a video in which he talks about his fears of being a father.
