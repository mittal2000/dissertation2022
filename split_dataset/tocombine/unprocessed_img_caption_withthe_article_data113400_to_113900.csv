Here in America, we do this by packing our schedules and maybe fitting in a long weekend of camping in between work meetings. And if you do take a vacation, you are not really, truly stepping away from your work, because chances are you still check your email -- just so things are not too crazy when you return. Yet in Europe, for many, if not most, August is the month of vacances season. Stores close, companies turn on their ""out-of-office"" messages and people embrace the idea of a true vacation. It is a culture that was created and enforced, and is now the norm. I can imagine that some economists' and many capitalists' heads are about to explode just at the mere thought of it, declaring that the United States is a ""successful"" country because we work hard and aren't over-indulged with endless vacation. This steers me back to the question of how to define success and whether wealth should trump happiness. At the end of the day, do we want a population of wealthy people or happy people? Which is more important to us? One of my favorite pieces of writing is ""The Busy Trap,"" an op-ed in the New York Times that was written by Tim Kreider two summers ago. It stuck with me and comes to mind every time I ask someone how he/she is doing and his/her response is, ""I'm so busy!"" -- or when I hear myself answer in the same way. As Kreider explains, these people are not busy, they are tired. It's almost always people whose lamented busyness is purely self-imposed...They're busy because of their own ambition or drive or anxiety, because they're addicted to busyness and dread what they might have to face in its absence.A friend of mine in New York worked for a very well-known consulting firm, and when I saw her for brunch one day, after not seeing her for years, she told me that she would work until 11 p.m. or midnight. She said it was a competitive culture where that had been encouraged - the longer you were there proved you were working harder than the other person, therefore making you more successful and worthy of the position. With the prospect of making almost $1 million per year, she left -- it wasn't enough to replace the fact that she was miserably unhappy and exhausted. Margaret Roach of A Way to Garden left her lucrative and successful career as the editorial director of Martha Stewart to move to upstate New York and spend her days gardening. In my interview with her she explained:I found I was saying the sentence, 'I don't have time for that' more than I was saying any other sentence in my life. That was my answer to everything. 'I'd really like to but I don't have time for that.' When I found I was saying that too many times, and feeling self conscious every time I was saying it, I knew that something had to give in the other direction.Finding herself dead center in the ""busy trap,"" she set out to create a new and different life for herself. The piece of our interview that has been rolling around in my head since we talked, though, is when she spoke about the importance of solitude. For Margaret, gardening isn't just a way to spend her days or make a career, but also a way to seek moments of solitude and meditation. She said:I definitely think that solitude is so undervalued. People have no quiet time, and I have no idea how you are supposed to figure out these kinds of questions that we are talking about if you don't shut up, and sit quietly by yourself. You can't do it while you are at 17 meetings in a row. You can't do it when you are rushing and thinking how you have to text so and so and on and on.This connects right back to Kreider's point that perhaps we fill our days with endless tasks and things to do so we don't have to be with our own thoughts and wonderings. This mentality is being transferred to our children, too. We schedule their days down to the last minute, and start planning endless ""play-dates"" for them as early as we can. So, even children don't know what it feels like to truly have August ""off."" As Anna Quindlen writes in ""Doing Nothing is Something"": Downtime is where we become ourselves, looking into the middle distance, kicking at the curb, lying on the grass or sitting on the stoop and staring at the tedious blue of the summer sky. I don't believe you can write poetry, or compose music, or become an actor without downtime, and plenty of it, a hiatus that passes for boredom but is really the quiet moving of the wheels inside that fuel creativity.What kind of society will we have if we don't allow moments of solitude for our children? What amount of creativity and innovation will be lost and what lasting effect will this have on our society? When starting a business or venturing out on your own, it can be so hard to not feel like you should be working constantly. The to-do lists and tasks are never-ending and it is on you to create the structure in your day. So, how do we take moments to really be quiet with ourselves, and disengage from the noise of technology and our busy schedules? How do we remember that busy does not equal better? While we might not have the power to turn America into Europe and declare August vacances season, we can take small steps to stop the busyness in our own lives and take real moments of solitude -- a ""vacances de la solitude,"" if you will. How will you chose to make time for vacations of solitude in your life?"

Each side had optimistically proclaimed that its troops would be in their opponent's capital by Christmas. Short quick wars had been the European pattern for the prior 50 years. The two Balkan wars in 1912 and 1913, the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and the Prussia-Austrian War of 1866 had all been short wars. Neither side was prepared to fight a long war nor did either side anticipate the demands that such a war would place on its manpower and industry. All sides mobilized quickly, or at least as quickly as they could, fearful that the war might be settled before they could bring the full power of their militaries to bear. Both sides anticipated a relatively mobile battlefield, especially on the Western Front. The Germans anticipated a quick sweep through Belgium in a week or less, but it took them almost three-times as long to cross the French border. The French had anticipated a deep, decisive thrust into Alsace-Lorraine. Their Plan 17 delivered an advance that was neither deep nor decisive and that found them back where they had started within two weeks. It was a modified version of the original Schlieffen Plan that was put into action when the German First, Second, and Third armies launched their attack on Belgium on August 4, 1914. The German Fourth and Fifth armies made up the center wing and the Sixth and Seventh armies the left wing of the German line. Instead of the forty-one and a half Corps envisioned by Schlieffen, the actual number deployed on the Western Front was closer to thirty-five Corps; roughly seventy-eight divisions instead of the original one hundred divisions. Last minute revisions, prompted by a fear of Russia's growing military strength, saw three army corps and one cavalry division transferred from the Western Front to the east. In total, approximately 250,000 men were transferred to the Eastern Front, roughly 180,000 in the period prior to the attack, and the balance, in response to Russian advances, subsequent to it. The original plan had envisioned an attack by some forty-one and a half corps, followed by a rapid advance through Belgium by the German right wing, while the center and left wing maintained defensive positions along the French border. In this way, the strategists believed, Paris could be bypassed and the French army defending it enveloped between the German right wing and its left and center wings, and utterly destroyed. In total, roughly ninety-one percent of German military strength was initially deployed on the Western Front and the balance of nine percent on the Eastern Front.Fifty-five of those divisions made up the right wing of the German attack. The cavalry corps of General von der Marwitz was the first German units to cross the border. The tiny territory of the Duchy of Luxembourg, which stood in the Germans' way, had been overrun on August 2 and was allowed to retain its independence throughout the war.France's initial response to the Schlieffen Plan consisted of two major elements. First was a series of strategic plans that culminated with Plan XVII. This plan envisioned a French counter-thrust through Alsace-Lorraine into Germany, threatening the flank of the Germany army advancing through Belgium. The second element of the French response saw the government encouraging Russia to seek funds on the French bond market in order to expand and modernize its railroad system and speed up the rate of mobilization. The faster Russia could mobilize, the French planners insisted, the less time Germany would have to defeat France before being forced to engage what the German General Staff dubbed the ""Russian Steamroller."" These are the infamous ""Russian Bonds"" that Lenin repudiated after the Bolshevik revolution, claiming that interest and principal had long since been paid with the blood that Russia had shed for France on the Eastern front. The bonds, still unredeemed and many of which still circulate to this day remain at the root of countless financial scams.The first setback the German forces encountered came just one day into their attack on Belgium. The highly fortified city of Liège and its ring of protecting forts lying astride the Meuse valley, turned out to be far more resistant than the Germans had expected. Heavy artillery, including two mighty, Krupp built, 420-millimeter (roughly 16 inch) siege howitzers, which had been hastily shipped from Essen, was brought into play.. The city eventually fell on August 16, after twelve days of bombardment. Following the fall of Liège, most of the Belgian army fell back to Antwerp and Namur, while the advancing Germans advanced on the Belgian capital, Brussels. The first shots of France's Plan XVII were heard on August 7, when the French VII Corps launched an attack on Alsace with the aim of taking the cities of Colmar and Mulhouse. Mulhouse had been captured, without opposition, by French forces on that same day. The event provoked delirious festivities in France, but German reinforcements were not long in arriving and a counter-attack came two days later. The French commander-in-chief, Marshal Joseph Joffre, dispatched a reserve division to help defend the city, but it was too late. Mulhouse fell into German hands once again on August 10, with the French withdrawing back towards the town of Belfort.A few days later, on August 14, the French First and Second Armies also went on the offensive with an assault towards Sarrebourg in Lorraine. They suffered heavy losses as the Germans withdrew slowly, in keeping with the Schlieffen Plan, and brought their rapid fire machine guns into play against infantry troops who were still wearing nineteenth century uniforms of blue coats and red pants. Simultaneously, the French Third and Fourth Armies advanced towards the River Saar, in a second attempt to take the city of Sarrebourg, but once again they were beaten back.By August 14th neither the French nor the German army was meeting its schedule. The French counterthrust into Lorraine against the flank of the German army had fizzled out and the French army was back where it had started. In the meantime, a tenacious Belgian defense, first at Liege and then at Namur and Brussels had slowed down the German advance. ""Six weeks to Paris and victory"" still seemed achievable, but Germany had suffered heavy losses and the advance had been delayed."

Astronomers say the planet may hold water on its surface and is the best candidate yet of a habitable planet in the ongoing search for an Earth twin. (AP Photo/NASA Ames, SETI Institute, JPL-Caltech, T. Pyle)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baec0dc3c000066000b8f0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As of July 2014, astronomers have discovered 1,739 confirmed exoplanets and 452 multiplanet solar systems. There are also an additional 4,234 unconfirmed planets detected by the NASA Kepler observatory. According to their sizes, the confirmed planets include 107 that are Earth-sized. About 47 of all confirmed planets are located in the habitable zones of their stars -- the distance from a star where liquid water might pool on the surface. Let's take a look at one of the most intriguing ones that is both Earth-sized and in the habitable zone of its star. It's called Kepler-186f, which means its the fifth planet (b, c, d, and e are the others) orbiting the star Kepler-186.Kepler-186f (Credit: NASA Ames/SETI Institute/JPL-Caltech)Known only by its catalog number, it has no name yet, but we know quite a bit about it already. It orbits a dim red star about 490 light-years from our Sun, in the constellation Cygnus. It has a year that is 130 Earth days long, at a distance similar to Mercury's from our own sun. Yet even from this proximity, at its surface the planet only gets about one third the sunlight that Earth does. If you were to set up a rooftop solar panel system to create electricity, the panels would have to occupy nine times the area of a similar system on Earth just to get the same amount of power. The planet is actually located near the outer edge of its star's habitable zone, under conditions much like our own planet Mars. Enough sunlight heats its surface that liquid water could exist. Kepler-186f is about 11-percent larger in radius than Earth and has a mass about 1.44 times that of Earth. This means that if you weigh 150 pounds on Earth, you would weigh about 175 pounds there as you watched the dim red sun Kepler-186 in the sky. Kepler-186f is far enough from its star that gravity probably would not have locked the planet's rotation so that it would always have the same side facing its star. But the planet would probably still rotate much more slowly and have a longer day than Earth -- perhaps weeks long. If it has an atmosphere as dense as Earth's with a hint of carbon dioxide, it could be a comfortable world, with surface temperatures above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. But with a thicker atmosphere like Venus, it could also be a deadly 500-degree-Fahrenheit hellhole! We just don't know yet.This rocky planet probably has a molten outer core like our Earth, so it can generate a protective magnetic field, but because the planet rotates so slowly, the field is much weaker than Earth's. This means that any atmosphere it may have could eventually leak away as the solar wind from its star slowly strips away the atmosphere over time. Some volcanism could help replenish it, so it's an interesting race between two opposing processes to sustain an atmosphere over the eons. Because its star is a red dwarf, the star emits very little ultraviolet light, so unlike on Earth, there may not exist a thick ozone layer. More importantly, there is no source of energy to drive organic chemistry leading to life on its surface. Sufficient energy might exist in underwater vents like those found deep in Earth's oceans, but this greatly reduces the volume of water where chemistry could lead over time to the first replicating molecules. It could be an ocean world frozen forever at the cusp of creating the first living systems, but without enough energy from sunlight on the planetary scale to push the right sequence of reactions over the threshold where larger replicating molecules like RNA and DNA could form.This artist's impression shows sunset from yet another Earth-like planet called Gliese 667 Cc. (Credit: Wikipedia/Calcada)Meanwhile, the star also hosts four additional planets (186b, 186c ,186d and 186e), though they are all closer to the star than Kepler-186f and are too hot to have liquid water. These four planets have lost the gravitational sweepstakes and are tidally locked, which means the same side of each planet always faces the star, in perpetual daylight. Surface temperatures are well above 200 degrees F all the time, under a blistering red sun that always stays in the same spot in the sky. With atmospheres, the temperatures could be even higher!The New FrontierThere are still thousands of other candidate planets that we know about, so the hunt for more twins to our own Earth continues. The biggest new challenge is to detect and measure the atmospheres of these planets to search for biosignature compounds like ozone and oxygen. Once those are discovered, we will know with certainty that some kind of life exists there, but because distances are so great, we will never be able to see what kinds of life have emerged: bacteria or dinosaurs? That remains the biggest frustration in the search for life beyond our solar system. Given that it's so far from Earth, we will never be able to send a space probe to visit any of these intriguing worlds. The travel time by conventional chemical or ion rockets would take millions of years, so we will have to study them using telescopes. Knowing that these habitable planets exist and may even bear life but never knowing its precise form will remain a source of great frustration for future humanity. The kind of human civilization needed to attempt star travel, whether robotically or with humans, does not exist, nor are there any historical templates for what such a human civilization needs to look like to make this kind of centuries-long dedication happen. Not even the single-minded toiling of the ancient Egyptians with their pyramids, or the Druids with their Stonehenge, serves as a guide. Perhaps only the recognition of a planetary, extinction-level event will galvanize humanity to become the kind of self-sacrificing civilization that can embark upon these kinds of journeys, despite the fact that not all humans can be saved by the effort. But for the time being, we can still gaze through our telescopes at these intriguing orbs, keep careful records of the habitable and life-supporting worlds we find, and wonder at the amazing possibilities they imply."

Mais non -- not in The Hundred-Foot Journey. La France is for tout le monde, or so we can feel -- though only after we also make a 100-foot journey into the community of mankind. That journey requires suspending a fair amount of reality testing, as anyone who has spent time in semi-rural southern France will attest. But if you can, and if you do, you will be treated to a Michelin three-star heart-warmer of a movie.We begin the journey in Mumbai. The Haji family has for generations cooked succulent Indian food but is displaced by accident and misfortune. They try to recreate their restaurant in London but the food there even today, especially the produce necessary to make it, leaves a person's palate wanting. Papa (the bulbous, endearing Om Puri), is the patriarch; he is widowed but surrounded by a son, two daughters, a son-in-law, and two grandchildren. In other words, a big, fat, wonderful Indian family. Packing their spices, they head to the continent in a decrepit van. Fate has them stall out in a southern French village set among rolling hills, transected by a serpentine river, and rich with the bounty of the surrounding farm and woodland.A one-star French restaurant distinguishes the village and draws diners from near and far. Madame Mallory (the regal Helen Mirren), a widow, rules the place with every detail of the restaurant and every hair on her head in place. She dreams of achieving a second Michelin star.Papa spots an old building, à vendre, across the road from Madame's tidy place. It is a rundown, abandoned restaurant 100 feet from Madame's property and her propriety -- about all there appears to be outside this village of old stone buildings, markets, and very French characters. Maintaining that being thrifty is different from being poor, Papa decides to buy the ruin of a restaurant and introduce the pleasures of south Indian cooking to the region. His secret weapon is his son, Hassan (Manish Dayal, a striking actor whose range carries him through the personal journey he portrays), with a gift for cooking that will change everyone, even the French and their revered cuisine. Amazingly, the Haji family is able to afford and purchase the property, get permission for restoration, and find French artisans and workers who are not on generous summer holidays (or taking long lunches) in what seems like weeks. Even producers Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey could not achieve that. Everything described about building a home and a life in the book, A Year in Provence, is truly an underestimate of how long that takes in rural France. I know: I have been at it for over 10 years. Hassan's sauces aren't the only incroyable ingredients in this film.Love interests abound and sweeten almost every scene. Boy (Hassan) meets girl (Marguerite, played by Charlotte Le Bon with a special glow and mesmerizing, saucer-sized eyes); the girl is an aspiring sous chef at Madame's restaurant, but we know right away that this tart dish will be cooking not just in the kitchen. Papa, a raucous, irreverent adventurer, develops a shine for the Madame, and she for him. But that pas de deux takes a lot more time.Romance needs adversity and its form in this film should come as no surprise. The French are known for their xenophobic contingent; they appear in this village too -- not just in right-wing French politics. But remember, it takes breaking some eggs and a fire before an omelet can be flipped and placed before you to relish. The bad guys are a necessary disruption before it arrives. And that, too, is not immediate, since you cannot truly come home until you leave, as does our hero Hassan. He becomes a celebrity chef, and a dissolute one at that, before discovering that home cooking is always the best. So, enjoy this sumptuous film that director Lasse Hallström (Oscar nominee for Chocolat) serves up. If we surrender to his cinematic 100-foot journey we discover that France is not only for the French. When they open their kitchens, their towns, and their hearts to étrangers (strangers) there is a feast to be had for all who sit down to dine. ---Dr. Sederer's new book for families who have a member with a mental illness is The Family Guide to Mental Health Care (Foreword by Glenn Close).

The regulatory (rule) proposal calls for cutting CO emissions from the power sector by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. This is potentially significant, because electricity generation is responsible for about 38 percent of U.S. CO emissions (about 32 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions).On June 18, EPA published the proposed rule in the Federal Register, initiating a 120-day public comment period. In my previous essay at this blog, I wrote about the fundamentals and the politics of this proposed rule (EPA's Proposed Greenhouse Gas Regulation: Why are Conservatives Attacking its Market-Based Options?). Today I take a look at the economics.Cost-Effective, Perhaps — but Efficient?The proposed rule grants freedom to implementing states to achieve their specified emissions-reduction targets in virtually any way they choose, including the use of market-based instruments (the White House has referenced cap-and-trade in this context, although somewhat obliquely as ""market-based programs,"" and state-level carbon taxes might also be acceptable — if any states were to include them in their plans to implement the regulation). Also, the proposal allows for multi-state proposals and for states and regions to establish linkages among their state and multi-state market-based instruments. Some questions remain regarding the temporal flexibility (banking and borrowing) that the proposed rule will allow, but it's reasonable to conclude at this point that although EPA may not be guaranteeing cost-effectiveness, it is allowing for it, indeed facilitating it. As Dallas Burtraw of Resources for the Future has said, the proposed rule ought to be judged to be potentially cost-effective.Cost-effectiveness (achieving a given target at the lowest possible aggregate cost) is one thing, but economists — and possibly some other policy wonks — may wonder if the proposal is likely to be efficient (maximizing the difference between benefits and costs). This is a much higher mountain to climb, and a particularly challenging one for a regional, national, or sub-national climate-change policy, given the global commons nature of the problem.The Challenge of this Global Commons ProblemGHGs mix globally in the atmosphere, and so damages are spread around the world and are unaffected by the location of emissions. This means that any jurisdiction taking action — a region, a country, a state, or a city — will incur the direct costs of its actions, but the direct benefits (averted climate change) will be distributed globally. Hence, the direct climate benefits a jurisdiction reaps from its actions will inevitably be less than the costs it incurs, despite the fact that global climate benefits may be greater — possibly much greater — than global costs.(An Aside: This presents the classic free-rider problem of this ultimate global commons problem: It is in the interest of no country to take action, but each can reap the benefits of any countries that do take action. This is why international, if not global, cooperation is essential. See the extensive work of the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements.)On June 2, EPA released its 376-page Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the proposed ""Clean Power Plan"" rule, the same day it released the 645-page proposed rule itself.  An RIA is essentially a benefit-cost analysis, required for significant new Federal rules by a series of Executive Orders going back to the presidency of Jimmy Carter, and reaffirmed by every president since, including most recently President Obama.Given the fundamental economic arithmetic of a global commons problem, it would be surprising — to say the least — if EPA were to find that the expected benefits of the proposed rule would exceed its expected costs, but this is precisely what EPA has found. Indeed, its central estimate is of positive net benefits (benefits minus costs) of $67 billion annually in the year 2030 (employing a mid-range 3 percent discount rate). How can this be?Two Answers to the ConundrumFirst, EPA does not limit its estimate of climate benefits to those received by the United States (or its citizens), but uses an estimate of global climate benefits.Second, in addition to quantifying the benefits of climate change impacts associated with CO emissions reductions, EPA quantifies and includes (the much larger) benefits of human-health impacts associated with reductions in other (correlated) air pollutants.Of course, even if benefits exceed costs at the given level of stringency of the proposed rule, it does not mean that the rule is economically efficient, because it could be the case that benefits would exceed costs by an even greater amount with a more stringent or with a less stringent rule. However, if benefits are not greater than costs (negative net benefits), then the rule cannot possibly be efficient, so I will stick with the all-too-common Washington practice and simply ask whether the analysis indicates a winner or a loser at the proposed rule's given level of stringency. In other words, the question becomes, ""Is the proposed rule welfare-enhancing (even if it is not welfare-maximizing)?""Now, let's take a look at the numbers from these two key aspects of EPA's economic analysis and the issues surrounding the calculations.U.S. versus Global DamagesThere are surely ethical arguments (and possibly legal arguments) for employing a global damage estimate, as opposed to a U.S. damage estimate, in a benefit-cost analysis of a U.S. climate policy, but employing a global estimate is a dramatic departure from the precedent of decades of Regulatory Impact Analyses.In a recent working paper, ""Determining the Proper Scope of Climate Change Benefits,"" Ted Gayer, Vice President and Director of Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, and Kip Viscusi, University Distinguished Professor of Law, Economics, and Management at Vanderbilt University, review the history of RIAs, including their virtually exclusive focus on national impacts (defined by geography or U.S. citizenship) in benefit and cost estimates of regulations. In the context of a conventional RIA, it does seem strange — at least at first blush — to use a global measure of benefits of a U.S. regulation. If this practice were applied in a consistent manner — that is, uniformly in all RIAs — it would result in some quite bizarre findings. For example, a Federal labor policy that increases U.S. employment while cutting employment in competitor economies might be judged to have zero benefits!Another example, this one courtesy of Tim Taylor via Ted Gayer: Under global accounting, if a domestic climate policy had the unintended consequence of causing emissions and economic leakage (through relocation of some manufacturing to other countries), that would not be considered a cost of the regulation (and with diminishing marginal utility of income, it might be counted as a benefit)!On the other hand, a counter-argument to this line of thinking is that the usual narrow U.S.-only geographic scope of an RIA is simply not appropriate for a global commons problem. Otherwise, we would simply restate in economic terms the free-rider consequences of a global commons challenge. In other words, a domestic-only RIA of a climate policy could have the effect of ""institutionalizing free riding,"" to quote my Harvard Kennedy School colleague, Professor Joseph Aldy. Of course, if global benefits are to be included in a regulatory assessment, it can be argued that global costs (such as leakage) should also be considered.I leave it to legal scholars and lawyers to debate the law, and I defer to the philosophers among us to debate the ethics, but let's at least ask what the consequences would be for EPA's analysis if a U.S climate benefits number were used, rather than a global number. For this purpose, we can start with EPA's estimates (from Table ES-7 on page ES-19 and Table ES-10 on page ES-23 of its Regulatory Impact Analysis of the proposed rule) for 2030 benefits and costs, using a mid-range 3 percent real discount rate. The estimated (global) climate benefits of the rule are $31 billion.In order to think about what the domestic climate benefits might be, we can turn to the Obama administration's original calculation of the Social Cost of Carbon in 2010, where the Interagency Working Group estimated a central global value for 2010 of $19 per ton of CO, and noted (and explained in more detail in a subsequent scholarly paper by several members of the Working Group) that U.S. benefits from reducing GHG emissions would be, on average, about 7 to 10 percent of global benefits across the scenarios analyzed with the one model that permitted such geographic disaggregation.(The Interagency Working Group also suggested that if climate damages are simply proportional to GDP, then the U.S. share would be about 23 percent. However, given the IPCC's prediction of highly unequal geographic distribution of climate change effects worldwide, combined with the exceptionally heterogeneous nature of climate sensitivity among the world's economies, which vary from those with trivial reliance on agriculture to those dominated by their agricultural sectors, I find the argument behind this second approach unconvincing.)Taking the midpoint of the Obama Working Group's 7–10 percent range, U.S. damages (benefits) may be estimated to be 8.5 percent of global damages, which would reduce the $31 billion reported in the new RIA to about $2.6 billion, which is considerably less than the RIA's estimated total annual compliance costs of $8.8 billion (assuming that the states facilitate cost-effective actions). This validates the intuition, explained above, that for virtually any jurisdiction, the direct climate benefits it reaps from its actions will be less than the costs it incurs (again, despite the fact that global climate benefits may be much greater than global costs).There are plenty of caveats on both sides of this simple analysis. One of the most important is that if the proposed U.S. policy were to increase the probability of other countries taking climate policy actions (which I believe is probably the case), then the impacts on U.S. territory of such foreign policy actions would merit inclusion even in a traditional U.S.-only benefit-cost analysis. More broadly, although it has been traditional to use a U.S.-only benefits measure in RIAs, the current guidelines for carrying out these analyses from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (Circular A-4) requires that geographic U.S. benefit and cost estimates be provided, but also allows for the optional inclusion of global estimates.Pending resolution (or more likely, discussion and debate) from lawyers and philosophers regarding the legal and ethical issue of employing domestic benefits versus global benefits in a climate regulation RIA, it is essential to recognize that there is an even more important factor that explains how EPA came up with estimates of significant positive net benefits (benefits exceeding costs) for the proposed rule (and would have even if a domestic climate benefits number had been employed), namely, the inclusion of (domestic) health impacts of other air pollutants, the emissions of which are correlated with those of CO.Correlated Pollutants and Co-BenefitsThe Obama administration's proposed regulation to reduce CO emissions from the electric power sector is intended to achieve its objectives through a combination of less electricity generated (compared with a business-as-usual trajectory), greater dispatch of electricity from less CO-intensive sources (natural gas, nuclear, and renewable sources, instead of coal), and more investment in low CO-intensive sources. Hence, it is anticipated that less coal will be burned than in the absence of the regulation (and more use of natural gas, nuclear, and renewable sources of electricity). This means not only less CO being emitted into the atmosphere, but also decreased emissions of correlated local air pollutants that have direct impacts on human health, including sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrogen oxides (NO), particulate matter (PM), and mercury (Hg).It is well known that higher concentrations of these pollutants in the ambient air we breathe — particularly smaller particles of particulate matter (PM) — have very significant human health impacts in terms of increased risk of both morbidity and mortality. The numbers dwarf the climate impacts themselves. Whereas the U.S. climate change impacts of CO reductions due to the proposed rule in 2030 are probably less than $3 billion per year (see above), the health impacts (co-benefits) of reduced concentrations of correlated (non-CO) air pollutants are estimated by EPA to be some $45 billion/year (central estimate)! (By the way, I assume that the co-benefits estimated by EPA are based upon a comparison with a business-as-usual baseline that includes the effects of all existing EPA and state regulations for these same local air pollutants. If not, the RIA will need to be revised.)The Bottom LineThe combined U.S.-only estimates of annual climate impacts of CO ($3 billion) and health impacts of correlated pollutants ($45 billion) greatly exceed the estimated regulatory compliance costs of $9 billion/year, for positive net benefits amounting to $39 billion/year in 2030. This is the key argument related to the possible economic efficiency of the proposed rule from the perspective of U.S. welfare. If EPA's global estimate of climate benefits ($31 billion/year) is employed instead, then, of course, the rule looks even better, with total annual benefits of $76 billion, leading to EPA's bottom-line estimate of positive net benefits of $67 billion per year. See the summary table below.The Obama administration's proposed regulation of existing power-sector sources of CO has the potential to be cost-effective, and if you accept these numbers, it can also be welfare-enhancing, if not welfare-maximizing.That said, I assume that proponents of the Obama administration's proposed rule will take this assessment of EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis as evidence of the sensibility of the rule, and opponents of the administration's proposed actions will claim that my assessment of the RIA provides evidence of the foolishness of EPA's proposal. So it is in our pluralistic system (not to mention, in the context of the political polarization that has gripped Washington on this and so many other issues).————————————————————————————————————————–Benefits and Costs of EPA's Proposed Clean Power Plan Rule in 2030(Mid-Point Estimates, Billions of Dollars)————————————————————————————————————————–"

I disagree with that statement. Science can be a good reason to do fun stuff also for those who have decent programming skills. I have always had high interest in music and art, but unfortunately I am not creative or talented enough to actually create them. Being well aware of my limitations, I took the typical career path of those who really like something but are not so good at it: I went into criticism. But instead of becoming a critic myself, I developed an algorithm that turns the computer into an art and music critic, being able to analyze visual art such as pieces by Pollock and Van Gogh, or music such as that of the Beatles.As in so many other research projects, the result was quite different from the initial objective, which was to analyze the vocal communication of whales. Many species of whales communicate by producing vocal messages that travel long distances underwater, but the nature of these calls is not well understood. To analyze large databases of whale sounds, I developed, with a graduate student, Carol Yerby, a computational method that ""learns"" and classifies different sounds made by whales. The calls were annotated manually by thousands of volunteers through a project called WhaleFM and then analyzed by our algorithm to map the different calls made by the whales. The algorithm works by extracting from each sound sample a comprehensive set of numerical descriptors reflecting the audio data, and then applying pattern recognition and statistical methods to analyze these numerical values and measure the similarity between each pair of sound samples.When we asked the computer to visualize the similarities between the sounds of the different whales, we noticed something interesting. The dialects of whales that live in the same geographic locations where more similar to each other than to those of whales living in other locations. The results were consistent for both killer whales and pilot whales. So the algorithm showed that whales, just like humans, have different accents based on the geographic location they live in.Vocal communication of whales sounds like songs whales sing to each other. So if our algorithm was able to analyze songs made by whales, we started to wonder how well it could analyze songs made by humans. The intersection between computing and the humanities is one of my research interests, so it just made sense to give it a try.Together with graduate student Joe George, we started to explore how the audio-analysis algorithms could be used to analyze music. We applied the algorithm to the studio albums of several well-known popular music bands, and naturally we started with the Beatles. Surprisingly, the computer sorted the Beatles albums by their chronological order, although it did not have any information about them other than the audio data. So by just ""listening"" to the music and analyzing all albums, the algorithm was able to determine which album was released before which. It even identified that the songs on Let It Be were recorded before those on Abbey Road, although Let It Be was released later.In a similar way we tested several other bands, such as ABBA, Queen, and U2, and the algorithm was able to deduce the chronological order of the albums automatically. In the case of U2, the algorithm detected just a mild change in the band's musical style during the late '80s and early '90s. For Queen the algorithm sorted the albums in almost perfect chronological order, but it also automatically separated Hot Space and subsequent albums from the previous albums, which agrees with the band's shift from their '70s musical style to their '80s sound. One band that we were not able to analyze was Led Zeppelin. The algorithm was not able to produce anything sensible by analyzing the albums of that band, and it seemed that for the algorithm each album was a world in itself, separated from the other albums. For more recent music we attempted to analyze the studio albums of Taylor Swift, but the computer just clustered the albums together, without identifying musical differences between them. We used that experiment as a negative control, but our attempt to study modern music was terminated rather prematurely, after my student refused to perform analysis of the albums of Justin Bieber. The main purpose of the algorithm was to provide a way of studying music in a quantitative fashion, but such algorithms might eventually have some practical uses, such as music discoverability. In the era of big data, computers will help by searching huge music databases and identifying the music we are likely to enjoy but would not have otherwise known about. When these algorithms become sufficiently smart, they will complete the transformation of the music-consumption culture, providing equal opportunity to all musicians to make their work accessible to their target audience without necessarily signing a contract with a mighty music label or making their way into radio station playlists."

They've fashioned themselves a new Big 3 with Love, LeBron James, and Kyrie Irving. They've also got Dion Waiters and Anderson Varejao, giving them one of the strongest starting fives in the league. They've also got plenty of shooting to help open up lanes for James, just like the Miami Heat had the last four seasons.The question, then, is how does the Cavs' ascension affect the rest of the league?For one, the Central Division will be stacked for years to come. The Cavs, the Chicago Bulls, and the Indiana Pacers (once Paul George returns) will all be vying for Eastern supremacy, not to mention the Milwaukee Bucks will undoubtedly build around No. 2 overall pick Jabari Parker and potentially become a Central Division hopeful.The New York Knicks were also hoping to upgrade in the near future, and now that James and Love have both committed to the Cavs their options are a bit more limited. But if this prompts someone like Dwight Howard or Rajon Rondo to move out to the Big Apple, the East suddenly becomes pretty top-heavy. The Timberwolves are also put in an interesting position, gaining two young prospects on rookie contracts and an additional first round pick, allowing them to build from the ground-up (once again) without much financial restriction. The question will be what kind of talent they can lure in free agency in order to build around a young Wiggins and Ricky Rubio combination. The Cavs have just as many question marks surrounding their new team. There's no doubt they'll be able to score, but what about the defensive end. Love, Irving, Waiters -- these guys known to be lock down defenders. In fact, LeBron may be the only legitimate defensive player on their team.They also shipped in new head coach David Blatt from overseas, where he enjoyed lots of success coaching Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv. But will he be able to draw up schemes that help this group gel on defense? Will he be able to adjust to the NBA game quick enough to see the same success he saw in Europe?In any case, the NBA has seen great competition among the league's best the last few seasons, and with all these changes things are shaping up to be even more interesting in the coming years."

They're a journal of sorts, spontaneous scenes written on the backs of envelopes, emails I sent and the ones I didn't. From the past: The letters to my family in Santa Fe reveal the desperate adolescent that I once was. She was trapped inside the adult me still trying to get approval from my family. I was like a scratched record with the needle stuck in the groove repeating the same idiotic chant I'm a good person, love me. Didn't work. My natal family excluded me. The obstacle was my mother. Ferreting out her reasons for selecting me as the enemy is a never-ending pursuit. Logic is useless. Writing, however, yields a cornucopia of scenes from my childhood. Many of them involve my mother, even when they don't start off that way. They're like dreams with disconnected images, time jumps and odd characters whom you know even though they don't look like themselves. Upon awakening the symbolism, the metaphors and the archetypes are plainly visible. Other times, I have to go through the editing process for the revelation to seep through, for me to peel back the layers.  I posted a short piece on FB about my 8th grade English teacher, focusing initially on how she titillated the class. She was hot and she knew it, but there was something else bubbling beneath the surface of that offbeat memory: Mrs. Burroughs, my 8th grade English teacher, entered the classroom with stilettos clicking. She was tall, thin and beautiful, her every movement poised and dramatic. She'd whirl her black cape off before perching straight-backed atop her desk to read us a poem. She crossed and re-crossed her long legs, fully aware that the entire class watched, enthralled. I sat in the front row and caught glimpses of her white panties. Before my parents' divorce, Mom had complimented other women: ""She's beautiful,"" or, ""I love her smile."" That changed once we were on our own. Working in classy restaurants and nightclubs in Santa Fe, Mom grew bitter, especially toward the women. I must have said something nice about Mrs. Burroughs because Mom immediately filled me in on her adulterous and desperate love affairs. To be fair, she also gossiped about men. ""He's married but he sleeps with guys, too."" There was no mistaking her amusement with the males she served, but women awakened a deep class resentment in my mother. There was no room for sisterhood here. To my mother, I represented all those females who were Have's: those she served. I'll never minimize the hard life my mother led, the male harassment she endured, and the loss of hope that she'd find a new husband who'd solve all her problems. ""No one wants a woman with children,"" she said. My education made her feel uncomfortable, but instead of being shy or reticent, she became angry if she didn't understand the conversation around her. This practice extended to other female friendships. She got involved with senior women's groups but after one trip with them she refused to participate. Instead of trying to broaden her scope, she preferred to remain alone rather than feel dumb or less than. Mom bonded with my younger brother and sister. My brother is mechanically brilliant and a good writer; my sister is smart and articulate. Mom lost me to education; I went off to college and escaped Santa Fe. She wasn't about to lose her other two children. Rather than use me as a successful role model, she preferred that they remain close to home. There, she could organize their focus on a common enemy: me. Neither of my siblings finished college. She'd already brainwashed my brother and sister about me, and then she started in on my children, telling them negative stories about me. Rather than call her on it, I wrote a humorous piece about her (The Tattoo Lady, Mother and Me.) I still hadn't admitted to myself that she was the DNA-connected Maleficent in my life.The present: I moved on. There's still love and affection in me for my mother and my siblings. I take them at face value. I remain straightforward. Let them deal.I want to believe good things about the people I love. Manipulative people assume that my guileless demeanor disguises something more sinister. I blew my sinister wad by the time I was 15 in an effort to protect my vulnerable heart. Thereafter, I took a sink or swim attitude and learned about gray areas. The ability to float gave me time to figure out how to survive.My boldest move? Even with my checkered family history and swearing I'd never have children . . . I did. Happy babies came out of me. They taught me an important lesson: we are not born to misery. Joy in life is our human birthright. I suspected this, but my childhood had filled me with doubt. This much I know: Reconciling with people you love is the right thing to do. Give those people a second chance, a third, a fourth or more. A close-knit family is a fervent wish of mine; I keep the lines of communication open with my sons and encourage them to stay in contact with each other. Conflict doesn't bother me if everyone has the same goal of working toward resolution. My natal family liked to sweep everything under the carpet and ignore the problems and their feelings except for the angry, bitter or hurt ones. They refused to take responsibility for their actions. Placing blame on others was the easy way out. The secrets crept out anyway.   Mom, the way I like to remember her.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
