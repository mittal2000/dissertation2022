Just $5 gets you in.For anyone who thrills watching horses galloping at top speed around Belmont racetrack, Polo is all of that but so much more.Horses and riders seem to be an extension of one another, racing down at 30 mph, stopping short, turning on a dime, while the rider wields a long mallet to swipe at a small white ball, sending it to a teammate or down the field, ultimately to get it through the goal post.  A match-up of Polo team captains at Bethpage State Park: Country Farms' Bob Ceparano and Mercedes' Alessandro Bazzoni © 2012 Karen Rubin/news-photos-features.comPolo has the speed of racing and the skill and control of dressage. This is the original ""Xtreme"" sport. It is rare to be so close to the action for a sport at this level and intensity -- absolutely thrilling.Announcer Jerry Napp, who has been playing Polo for 50 years (he's 71), explains the game and introduces the players -- teams of four -- and gives the play by play. In some respect, Polo is still a sport of kings - or at least someone who has a king's ransom. It is expensive to maintain the stable of horses and pay the professionals. The teams are sponsored by a patron, and polo is unique among team sports in that amateur players, often the team patrons, routinely hire and play alongside the sport's top professionals.Our home team is Country Farms, of Medford, which stables and trains horses and riders, which is led by Bob Ceparano. He sponsors the team, is a player, and hosts Polo at the Park.Today's game pits Country Farms against the Mercedes Team, led by its sponsor, Alessandro Bazzoni.We watch enthralled through six chukkers (like periods) of seven minutes each. The riders and their mounts tear down the field at full gallop - at times, all four hoofs of the horse are off the ground. they make a mad scramble for the ball, striking from the side, propelling it forward or backward, passing or sending it hurling down the field.At the end of each chukker, spectators come out onto the field to help replace the divots. The riders change horses.Napp talks about some of the players -- a couple are renowned professionals from Argentina, like Naco Taverna, and we see their prowess on the field in today's play.Naco Taverna, who also trains polo ponies, comes out onto the field ahead of the other players, and while he waits for the rest, and gives inadvertently, it seems, gives us a bit of a demonstration of maneuvering the horse through sharp turns, right lead to left lead to circle, I am surprised to learn that there are about a half-dozen women who are on the teams.The game of Polo originated in Persia, and has been played in the United States since 1876.The Polo Grounds at Bethpage State Park, built in 1934, offers a 900 ft x 400 ft field with bleacher seating. Bethpage State Park hosted the 1994 finals of the US Open Polo Championship.The sport more readily associated with royals and aristocrats probably came to Long Island because of August Belmont, one of the ""founding fathers"" of American Polo (and the namesake of Belmont Racetrack). Belmont, along with H.L Herbert and James Gordon Bennett financed the original New York Polo Grounds. (In Great Neck, Polo Road used to be where they played Polo.) Another figure in American Polo playing was Harry Payne Whitney (the Whitneys also had Long Island associations), who in the early part of the 20th century, changed the way Polo was played in the US to a high-speed sport, using the fast break, sending long passes downfield to riders who had broken away from the pack at a full gallop.That style of play is on view today at Bethpage Polo Field.You quickly appreciate how dangerous this game can be because of the speed, the sheer weight and force of the horses and the way the mallets are swung and the ball flies, sometimes ricocheting or mis-hit.Jerry Napp explains that every care is taken to protect the horses and riders - this isn't like hockey or basketball where there are intentional hits and fouls.The rules were created and are enforced to ensure the welfare of players and their horses. The ""line of the ball"" changes each time the ball changes direction. The player who hit the ball generally has the right of way, and other players cannot cross the line of the ball in front of that player. As players approach the ball, they ride on either side of the line of the ball giving each access to the ball. A player can cross the line of the ball when it does not create a dangerous situation.It comes down to the last few seconds, a dash down the field, a strike and ...... g-o-a-l. Mercedes wins 7-6.After the game, we can go over and chat with the riders and see the ponies close up. Try to do that at Belmont or at Citifield.Country Farms, which hosts Polo at the Park, has a 14 acre-facility with housing for up to 70 horses, an 80 x 220 indoor riding arena, mirrored, with 22 stalls attached, and a new football-field sized equestrian events arena, also hosts a summer camp for children to teach riding skills (four two-week sessions, 4 days a week, from July through August). Country Farms Equestrian Center, 200 Bellport Avenue, Medford New York 11763, Phone 631-345-9585, www.country-farms.com.You can see Polo at Bethpage State Park every Sunday from June 5 through October 15. Vehicle parking is $8 per vehicle (this is a State charge). Gates open at 1pm for food concession and seating. V.I.P. Pavilion by invitation only. V.I.P. field side tailgate, tenting and food service available for additional fees. Half time shows when available. (The game is cancelled when there are thunder storms).____________________ © 2012 Travel Features Syndicate, a division of Workstyles, Inc. All rights reserved.

And in this realm, technology -- currently -- is not our friend.",2012-08-03,2016-08-23-1471918633-1097606-_revisedjeffmasthead1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-23-1471918633-1097606-_revisedjeffmasthead1-thumb.jpg,"Two of my favorite texts from university explore the impending chaos that would erupt with the fall of the Judeo-Christian ethos. In The Second Coming, Yeats states that ""mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."" In The Greatest Danger, Nietzsche states that ""the greatest labour of human beings hitherto has been to agree with one another regarding a number of things, and to impose upon themselves a law of agreement regardless of whether these things are true or false."" Nietzsche loathed Christianity but admitted that without agreement to a common set of societal mores, madness and chaos would ensue.We are now here. Now-here. Nowhere.Technology has trumped Christianity as a belief system, and there is no longer an agreed-upon protocol for etiquette in general and for communications in particular. People correspond though text messages, email, IM, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and telephone -- and the occasional snail mail or fax -- and there are no established rules. For the younger generation in particular, it is the wild wild west.When historians look back on the former United States of Amerigo Vespucci, they will certainly find text messaging to be as efficacious as smoke signals. As a therapist I have witnessed countless couples break up due to misguided, misfired, misunderstood, and mistimed text-messages. I have heard that 90 percent of communications are provided by visual cues; for me, the tone of someone's voice is equally important. Text messaging and email convey little to sink one's teeth into and can go askew in the blink of an eye.I'm old school. Years ago I spent weeks combing through the hundreds of pages of Rilke's and Lou Andreas-Salome's hand-written letters and felt the brilliance, passion, wit, poetry, integrity, love, and dedication therein. Correspondence, like therapy, can be art. Or at least artful.Personally, I espouse a doctrine I call Medium Fidelity. If somebody -- anybody -- telephones me, then I telephone him or her back. If somebody emails me, then I email him or her back. I try to remain faithful to the medium that the sender employed as a sign of decorum. And I try to respond to all emails and telephone calls within 24 hours. I teach workshops on authentic happiness, relationships and communications so I cannot afford to be a hypocrite in my personal life. You have no idea how many potential clients are surprised with joy when I answer the telephone or return their calls. ""Oh, you're the first psychotherapist who bothered to return my phone call,"" I have heard more than a few times.Here in Los Angeles I've been on the receiving end of fellow wounded healers and rampant do-gooders canceling imminent meetings via email so many times that my ears now hear ""Let's get Kombucha next week!"" as ""The check is in the mail!"" Why do people feel compelled to bother organizing putative meetings that they know they are going to cancel? Shouldn't there be a mandatory course given to young people on business etiquette, respect, efficient communications, and scheduling? Most people would agree with Woody Allen that ""95 percent of life is showing up,"" and yet so many people today can't manage to do even that. For me it's about the world I want to live in. Call me idealistic, but I want to create a world where people communicate respectfully, compassionately and authentically with each other. And in this realm, technology -- currently -- is not our friend.Technology is not our friend because our minds are meaning-making machines, and our current ways of communicating are vague and leave enormous room for misinterpretation. For instance, if a passionate girlfriend is in the middle of a text message conversation with her new lover and he drops off, she assumes that mettle more attractive has garnered his attention. If one is in the middle of a business negotiation and the other party stops emailing for a few days should it be assumed that this is a tactical move or that the other party has lost interest or has gone on vacation?I don't know what the solution is. Like Yeats, I cannot imagine the next world order in a positive light.But, as I state in ""Mindfulness for Depression,"" I am old enough to remember a time when a phone call was like a gift and all the people in the home would run to it in anticipation. In just 40 short years telephone calls have become nuisances. Now we rely on text messaging and emails so that we can be afforded the luxury of multitasking. Is it any wonder why so many business ventures end in lawsuits and relationships end in heartache?""And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"" "

Not to state the obvious, but as those flawless abs, strong shoulders and rock-solid thighs illustrate, our Olympians are in tip top shape, blasting thousands and thousands of calories, all in a day's work. In fact, Mayo Clinic researcher Michael Joyner told The New York Times that elite athletes can burn 15-20 calories a minute (then multiply that for a four, five or six hour training session).While we mortal desk jockeys can't compete, why not take a page from our favorite athletes this weekend, allowing their feats of fitness to inspire us to get up off the couch and get moving? Whether you're moved by soccer stars or record-setting swimmers, we rounded up 15 popular sports from the summer Olympics, along with the amount of calories we (non-Olympians) can expect to burn in a half hour spent on each activity. All counts are approximate and based on a 150-pound person, unless otherwise noted. Let the games begin!"

As the Huffington Post reported last year: Cash WinFall was a relatively obscure game where players had to match six numbers on their ticket with randomly drawn numbers. But if no one matched all six and the unclaimed jackpot was around $2 million, the prize money was redistributed among ticket holders with fewer matching numbers. Statisticians calculated that players buying $100,000 of tickets were virtually guaranteed to win during those brief periods. The gambling group bought more than $40 million in tickets in all and won roughly $48 million, according to the report and the Boston Globe. Lottery officials found out about the loophole in 2010 or possibly earlier, but didn't do anything about it because the gamblers generated $16 million in revenue for the Massachusetts lottery, according to the report.It was only in the summer of 2011, after the Boston Globe started working on an article about the scheme, that Massachusetts lottery officials placed a $5,000 limit on the amount of tickets that retailers could sell per day.Massachusetts state treasurer Steven Grossman halted the Cash WinFall game this year, according to the Boston Globe. ""I feel it is important to essentially apologize to the public,"" Grossman said. ""We're sorry some gained unfair advantage.""Massachusetts could have learned its lesson from another state. After Michigan retiree Gerald Selbee figured out how to game Michigan's similar Winfall lottery, he and his gambling group won nearly $8 million, according to Business Insider. When Michigan shut down its WinFall game in 2005, Selbee set his sights on Massachusetts where Cash WinFall had recently been introduced. "

It punished them for ""not using one's best efforts to win a match"". ""We applaud the federation for having taken swift and decisive action,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told The Associated Press. ""Such behavior is incompatible with the Olympic values.""How about you? Do we embody Olympic values in our lives? Millions in the world are watching the Olympics. We are rooting for our home teams and rejoice in the heroics of the athletes. Yet, as Nike made famous many years ago, the Olympic Games are a moment to reflect on the motto -- Life is not a Spectator Sport. Every four years, nations from all over the globe bring their best and say. ""Here is what we can become."" We are drawn to Olympics for we intuitively sense the majesty and glory of human achievement. Whether in basketball, gymnastics, synchronized swimming or track and field we are in awe of the Olympians' dedication, skill and excellence. We celebrate their efforts at achieving their potential... every day. In truth, their model can serve as an inspiration of us. We can all be Olympians in our own fields and our own games. In one of my favorite books, Personal Best, Dr. George Sheehan remarks,"" Life is a positive sum game... everyone from the gold medalist to the last finisher can rejoice in personal victory. Heroism is ever available and in fact, it is through ordinary experiences that ordinary man can become extraordinary.""As Danish philosopher Soren Keirkegaard wrote, ""Heroism means being great in what every human can be great in -- simply doing the best we can."" What are four elements for achieving our personal best, our gold medal? The acronym G.O.L.D encapsulates the answer. Goals -- Clearly identify your core values and mission. Single minded focus on our goals will enable us to prioritize our time and talents to realize our dreams. Opportunities -- Training for the Olympics presents challenges and risks. In life, we are faced with adversity and the fear of failure. Yet, if the goal is noble, we will be blessed with an inner strength and fortitude to transform the obstacles into opportunities. As Joseph Campbell remarked, ""The cave you most fear contains the greatest treasure."" ()Love -- Pursue Your Goals with Passion and Emotional Engagement. If we love what we do, we will not be working a day in our lives. Daily Investments -- Greatness is not achieved through once a week or monthly devotion. Olympic athletes design every day with GOLD in mind. If we want to become a better parent, spouse, or child, it requires ongoing effort and action. The road to greatness is indeed hard labor. Like Olympians, we experience fatigue and pain. We wonder whether our efforts are worth it. Yet, we will also be rewarded with the best gold medal of all. We will know that in our lives we gave ourselves, our loved ones, our community and the world our very best!"
