The ad in question tells the story of a woman who died of cancer and suggests that, had she not been laid off by Romney's Bain Capital, she would have lived. CNN fact-checked the ad and found it to be inaccurate. The Romney campaign has disputed the spot's accuracy and disparaged the Obama campaign for not denouncing it.According to Buzzfeed, the email version included a total of nine numbers, which were for the agents and organizations which represent the Hollywood figures. One ""Hollywood exec"" told that news site that ""three or four"" calls had come into his company's switchboard. Though it's reasonably easy to obtain office phone numbers, disseminating that information still appears to be frowned upon. Twitter recently suspended the Twitter account of The Independent's Guy Adams after he posted the phone number of an NBC executive. Adams posted the number and suggested those upset with NBC's infamous tape-delay treatment of the Olympics call it to complain. Twitter latter reinstated his account.The Grassfire Nation email also accused the Obama campaign of working with Priorities USA Action, a PAC. "

3,ENTERTAINMENT,"FX Has The Movies And The Money, Thanks To Bold Acquisition Campaign",Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fx-movies-acquisition_us_5bb3fc4ce4b066f8d252dbd3,"But Adams said that revenue and profit are growing far faster at basic cable channels than at premiums, which could eventually",2012-08-11,"In this film image released by Disney, Chris Evans, portraying Captain America, left, and Robert Downey Jr., portraying Tony Stark, are shown in a scene from ""Marvel's The Avengers"" (AP Photo/Disney, Zade Rosethal)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3fc4c250000320038d498.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Want to watch ""Avatar"" or ""The Avengers,"" the two highest-grossing movies so far in the 21st century, on TV? How about ""The Social Network,"" ""Ted,"" ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" or any of the ""Twilight"" or ""Transformer"" movies? Unless you subscribe to a premium movie channel like HBO or Showtime, you have only one option: FX.Over the past decade, the basic cable network, founded in 1994 by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has pursued an ambitious strategy of movie acquisitions, effectively cornering the market for the TV broadcast of blockbuster movies. FX bought the rights to a dozen of the 20 top-grossing movies of 2009, 10 of the top 20 of 2010, 12 of the top 20 of 2011 and 11 of the top 20 so far in 2012. Film is by far the biggest programming category on FX, occupying 57 percent of the channel's broadcasting time, according to a recent report by IHS Screen Digest. The network spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year acquiring movies -- ""Avatar"" alone is said to have cost from $25 million to $30 million to acquire. That means the strategy is a pricy gamble. But so far, it seems to have paid off. Since FX started down the movie-focused path, it's become one of the most profitable channels on TV. ""It's working. The consumers are responding. That allows them to negotiate substantially higher carriage fees from cable providers. And at the same time, they're selling ads at much higher rates,"" analyst Tom Adams of IHS told The Huffington Post. ""In the past few years, they've doubled programming costs, but they've tripled revenue.""Chuck Saftler, who as executive vice president of FX has been the chief architect of the strategy, told The Huffington Post that he was originally drawn to film because other networks were reducing movie acquisitions. ""The Turner networks started to define their brands as drama and comedy, and started going after TV acquisitions very aggressively,"" Saftler explained. ""And they started to abandon their movie strategy. The broadcast networks also abandoned their movie strategies for the most part as they took on more reality shows for programming. Rather than running an off-theatrical movie, they started owning their properties."" Saftler said his rivals assumed that movies broadcast on TV competed directly with DVDs and with movie-watching services like Netflix -- a logical enough supposition, given that the content is identical. FX competitors figured that TV movies could never compete with media that offered superior quality and range of options, without commercials. So cable networks cut spending on acquiring movies in favor of buying syndication rights for shows from the broadcast networks and developing their own original content. But Saftler had a hunch that his rivals misunderstood how audiences respond to movies on TV. He agreed that someone in the mood to watch a specific movie is always going to opt for a DVD or Netflix. But there's another class of viewer that stumbles across movies as they're flipping through the channels. And he suspected that many of these casual viewers would be likely to watch the movie they landed on straight through to the end -- no matter when they happened to start watching.""When we come across a movie that we really have liked, we might dive in, thinking we'll watch a scene -- and the next thing we know, we're at the rolling end credits,"" Safter said. ""That's the strategy that we deployed. We call it the 'flypaper strategy,' because people join these movies at every minute of their play. Right up through the last minutes of the movie, you have people joining."" FX slowly started implementing its 'flypaper strategy' in 2002. The movie showings attracted large audiences and cost less, on a per-hour basis, than the syndicated shows that FX had focused on before, so they quickly started boosting the network's profitability. That gave Saftler more cash to spend on film rights. FX's movie strategy kept snowballing until it reached today's dominant position. Erik Brannon, the principal author of the Screen Digest report, told The Huffington Post that FX's success has attracted notice from USA and TNT, prompting bidding wars for many hit movies. ""The genre is heating back up,"" Brannon said.Saftler said he's confident that FX will be able to maintain its place atop the heap.""TNT and USA have tied up a lot of their financial resources in acquiring syndicated drama and comedy shows,"" Saftler said. ""If you're talking about 200 episodes at $2 million an episode, for something like ""The Mentalist,"" that's $400 million. That, I think, is going to prevent them from mounting that strategy in a near-term aggressive manner.""That means that the only TV players who have a more prominent stake in the movie business than FX are the premium movie channels. They air movies about six months after they appear in theaters. Movies don't come to free TV channels, including FX, until at least three years after their theatrical debut. The reason for this delay is that free channels usually buy rights to individual movies -- while premium channels sign huge, decade-long contracts with studios granting them the rights to every movie released. Such deals are among the studios' most dependable sources of revenue. And for now, FX has no reason to challenge the status quo.""I don't believe that the ratings would be significantly higher if we could get the film a year and a half earlier. We're doing very well with our ratings -- so I'm not sure that the incremental boost we'd get from having them first would be worth the price,"" Saftler said.But Adams said that revenue and profit are growing far faster at basic cable channels than at premiums, which could eventually prompt FX to spend the small fortune it would take to break into the premium channels' first-run window.""The amount of money spent by basic and premium cable right now are so far apart that it's hard to imagine a basic cable channel bidding against a premium,"" Adams said. ""But the trends are there. In the distant future, somebody could make that bold move."" "
4,SPORTS,"Usain Bolt, Jamaica Win 4x100-Meter Relay Gold Medal, Set World Record (PHOTOS)",Chris Greenberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/usain-bolt-jamaica-4x100-world-record-jamaica_us_5bb6ad7fe4b097869fd253af,STORY CONTINUES BELOW Bolt received the baton from teammate Yohan Blake and then left behind Ryan Bailey of the United States,2012-08-11,"Jamaica's Usain Bolt leads United States' Ryan Bailey to win the men's 4 x 100-meter relay final during the athletics in the Olympic Park during the 2012 Summer Olympics, Saturday, Aug. 11, 2012, in London. Jamaica set a new world record with a time of 36.84 seconds.(AP Photo/Anja Niedringhaus)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6ad7f210000d601c8c829.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Usain Bolt put an exclamation point on his performance at the London Olympics with another gold medal and another world record. Running the anchor leg in the men's 4x100-meter relay, Bolt helped the Jamaican team win the gold medal in 36.84 seconds, a new world record. Just days after declaring himself ""the greatest athlete to live,"" the charismatic 25-year-old sprinter went back to work bolstering his argument. Bolt received the baton from teammate Yohan Blake and then left behind Ryan Bailey of the United States to reach the finish line ahead of the field. The United States won the silver in 37.04 seconds, a new national record. Canada finished the race third but was disqualified, giving the bronze to Trinidad and Tobago. CLICK HERE for complete results.Nesta Carter ran the opening leg for Jamaica, followed by Michael Frater. Neither sprinter had previously competed during the London Games. The two runners who next carried the baton for Jamaica, however, have made frequent appearances on the medal stand: Blake and Bolt. Blake finished runner-up to Bolt in the 100 meters and 200 meters before running up behind him during the relay with the baton. After a clean transition, Bolt blew open what had been a tight race between the U.S. runners and Jamaica. ""I knew it was over when I saw Yohan [Blake] catching Tyson Gay,"" Bolt told reporters after the race. ""I knew it was over because I knew [Ryan] Bailey could not outrun me on the straight.""STORY CONTINUES BELOW Trell Kimmons led off for the U.S. team, making his first appearance of the Games. He was followed by Justin Gatlin and Tyson Gay, who both finished behind Bolt and Blake in the 100. When Gay passed the baton to Bailey, the United States was running neck and neck with Jamaica but the long strides of the 6'5"" Bolt opened up a gap along that final straightaway. The U.S. time of 37.04 seconds matches the previous world record set by Jamaica at the last Olympics, a mark smashed by Jamaica in 2012. In 2008, Bolt ran the third leg as the quartet of Jamaican sprinters set that standard. ""I think there's a possibility,"" Bolt said before the relay about the chance of setting a new record. ""But you can never really say it, because it's a relay and there's a baton. You never know. But for me, we're going to go out, enjoy ourselves, run fast as possible. It would be a good way to close the show again.""While there remains another day of events in London and several more medals are still to be awarded, Bolt certainly ended his portion of the show in style. Having won gold in the 100 meters, 200 meters and the 4x100-meter relay in London, Bolt has pulled off an unprecedented double triple, successfully defending each of the three gold medals that he won at the Beijing Games in 2008. Given the spotlight on Bolt in London and the doubts swirling around him upon his arrival, Bolt's 2012 performance may be even more impressive than his 2008 effort when he established (or helped establish, in the case of the relay) three world records. In his latest 100-meter triumph, Bolt got under his Beijing time (but not his 2009 world record) to establish a new Olympic record. In the 4x100-meter relay on Saturday, Bolt helped smashed the world record that he'd helped set in 2008. And, in the 200 meter, Bolt pressed his finger to his lips as he breezed across the finish line, delivering a message to those who thought he couldn't possibly make history again. ""That was for all that people that doubted me, all the people that was talking all kinds of stuff that I wasn't going to do it, I was going to be beaten,"" Bolt said after holding off Blake in the 200 final. ""I was just telling them: You can stop talking now, because I am a legend.""After the 4x100-meter relay, Bailey wasn't calling Bolt a ""legend"" but he was nonetheless awestruck -- and calling him something else. ""Wow. He's a monster,"" Bailey told The Associated Press. ""He's a monster.""Whether he's a legend or a monster, Bolt had to vanquish a ""Beast"" to cement his legacy. Like U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps, Bolt's sternest challenge came from a countryman. Nicknamed ""The Beast,"" Blake defeated Bolt in the 100 and 200 meters at the Jamaican Olympic trials. These losses and murky reports of back and hamstring injuries had many doubting that he'd be able to equal his medal haul from Beijing. But Bolt shed doubters during the course of the Games as easily as he outpaced Bailey in his final event. As evidenced by joyous victory poses and interactions with the fans, Bolt took to the spotlight so readily that Paul Heyward of The Telegraph couldn't help but compare him to Muhammad Ali.""I came here to London to become a legend, and I am a legend, and I wanted to thank them for supporting me,"" Bolt told reporters, via AP, after the relay, describing his wave to the crowd.With quotes like this coming in greater numbers than his gold medals, Heyward wasn't alone in making such comparisons as Bolt's proclamations about his own greatness evoked the bygone boasts of a certain American boxer who won gold at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. Although he may have since changed his mind, IOC President Jaques Rogge wasn't quite ready to declare Bolt a ""legend"" in the hours before the 200 meters final. ""Let him participate in three, four games, and he can be a legend,"" Rogge said. ""Already he's an icon.""After winning gold in the relay, Bolt wondered if Rogge was ready to reassess his status. ""Next time you see him, ask him what else I have to do to be a legend,"" Bolt requested of the media, according to Paul Kelso of the Daily Telegraph.  "

The first was the shocking truth that Brazil had never won a gold medal in its signature sport. The second was the absence through injury of Mexico's Giovani dos Santos. Logic seemed to dicate that the latter fact would take care of the former reality. It didn't take long for Mexico to turn that line of thinking upside down en route to a 2-1 win, clinching the first gold medal in soccer in its own history. In the 29th second of the game, Mexico striker Oribe Peralta capitalized on a Brazilian turnover to open the scoring with a clinical near-post strike. With the early introduction of Hulk from the substitutes bench, Brazil would press for a goal for the remainder of the first half but Mexico held its nerve and its lead into the intermission. Brazil's 20-year-old Neymar looked at turns -- and pirouettes -- the most elusive, dangerous player on the field but it was Peralta who would net the second score of the game. The 28-year-old forward who plays his club ball with Santos Laguna doubled the Mexican lead in the 75th minute when he got his head on to a cross from Marco Fabian, who fired in cross from a free kick from the right wing that was set up by a foul committed by Marcelo. Despite holding a 60/40 possession percentage edge (per London2012.com) and taking 19 shots to 12 by Mexico, Brazil lacked the cutting edge in the final third, where there always seemed to be too many green shirts and too many lunging legs with green socks blocking and deflecting shots and passes. For all his individual skills, Neymar was surrounded and smothered before he could get off his shot or thread that final pass on several occassions. Peralta, however, kept carving out space for himself amidst the Brazilian defense marshaled by Thiago Silva. In the 69th minute, he found the back of the net after being correctly whistled for offside. Minutes earlier, Fabian had nearly scored on a bicycle kick that cracked off the crossbar. Not long after both went close to doubling the lead individually, they would connect for the goal that would prove the game-winning score.WATCH VIDEO ABOVE   Just as the many Mexico fans at Wembley Stadium were beginning to celebrate in earnest, Hulk pulled a goal back for Brazil in injury time. Moments later the bulky Brazilian with the apt moniker swung in a cross from the right wing, setting up Oscar with a clear chance to equalize. Rising, undefended, just yards from the goal, Oscar got his head to the ball but fired it over the crossbar. After that miss, all that was left was the celebration for Mexico. "

7,WELLNESS,Teamwork Secrets We Can Learn From the Bryan Brothers,"Ben Greenfield, Contributor
Author of the New York Times bestseller Beyond Training book; ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bryan-brothers-olympics_us_5b9c002ae4b03a1dcc7baa3f,"Whether you're a tennis enthusiast or not, you can apply the teamwork lessons of the Bryans to any aspect of your life.",2012-08-10,"Gold medalists Mike Bryan, left, and Bob Bryan, right, of the United States, listen to the U.S. national anthem during the medal ceremony of the men's doubles final at the All England Lawn Tennis Club at Wimbledon, in London, at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Saturday, Aug. 4, 2012. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c002a2400003200530a79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bob and Mike Bryan are twin brothers and American professional tennis double players. They've been the world's top-ranked doubles team for more than 297 weeks, which is longer than any other team in doubles history. After winning the bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Bryans won the gold medal in London.Whether you're playing tennis or some other sport or just want to enhance your communication skills, you can learn quite a lot from the Bryans, who seem to have an uncanny ability to read each other's minds while they work as a seamless, cohesive, and almost unstoppable unit.Here are three key teamwork lessons we can learn from the Bryans this summer: 1. Pick the Right PartnerWhen it comes to picking the right partner, the Bryan twins won the genetic lottery. But even if you don't have a biological double, you can still choose your partner wisely. For example, if you are the type of person who likes to be in control and call the shots, then teaming up with someone who has similar characteristics may lead to friction and arguments. Instead, in any relationship (work or personal), choose the person that complements your leadership and communication style. Sometimes picking the right partner may mean that you choose different people to be the leaders for different categories. For example, in our household, my wife calls the shots when it comes to what's for dinner, and I call the shots when it comes to planning our travel. By knowing our respective roles, we can avoid conflict.2. Get the First Ball InThe most important component of a successful partnership is the first ball -- specifically getting that first ball in, whether you're serving or returning. The Bryan brothers are masters of a high first-serve percentage and a conservative but effective and consistent serve return -- which means they nearly always get a chance to play out the point.When you're working with a team, you don't necessarily have to have everything perfect before you make a final decision. In the same way that the key in tennis is not to serve every ball at 140 miles per hour, but rather to get that first ball in, the key in teamwork is to make a decision and move on, even if everything doesn't have as many fireworks, bells, and whistles as you'd like it to. For example, if you're bringing a new product to market, this may mean simply getting it into people's hands and beginning to do business, rather than spending a ton of time trying to make it perfect. Or if you're trying to get fit, rather than waiting for the perfect workout routine to come along or for your body to feel just right, just go the gym or go outside and start moving. Sometimes waiting until everything is just right means that you never give yourself a chance to actually play out the point!3. Reward Yourself and Your Teammates Every TimeYou'll notice that the Bryan brothers are pretty emotional on the court, rewarding each other with handshakes, high fives, smiles, and fist pumps every time they score. They let each other know that they're happy about each success. In the same way, when you reward yourself or your team for every success, no matter how small, you create a subconscious desire to keep on succeeding over and over again. This may mean sending out thank you notes or email messages every time you see anything positive in your team, celebrating successes each month with a team party or gathering, or rewarding yourself with work breaks, mini-vacations, or just a trip to the movies or the mall when you achieve a personal breakthrough.Whether you're a tennis enthusiast or not, you can apply the teamwork lessons of the Bryans to any aspect of your life.

Gold Medalist, 200-Meter Butterfly, 2000 Olympic Games",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/summer-fitness_us_5b9c0257e4b03a1dcc7bbaa3,One of my biggest challenges upon hanging up my racing suit was learning how to be fit and healthy without holding myself to those Olympic standards (which are nearly impossible to sustain). I am not alone in this.,2012-08-10,"A light worker sets a spotlight in front the Olympic rings logo, in Coventry, England, Tuesday, July 24, 2012. Opening ceremonies for the 2012 London Olympics will be held Friday, July 27. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c02572400003000948382.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As an Olympian, I am well aware of the temptation to go to extremes with a fitness regime. One of my biggest challenges upon hanging up my racing suit was learning how to be fit and healthy without holding myself to those Olympic standards (which are nearly impossible to sustain). I am not alone in this. We all want quick results and convince ourselves that a cold-turkey-extreme-plunge-into-fitness-hell will be exactly what we need to get our health and our looks where we want them. We believe that the reward is worth the effort (and the bruises our body might sustain along the way). Nothing could be further from the truth. From one ""type A"" to another, I invite you to join me in a new extreme -- moderation! Be extremely moderate when it comes to your health and fitness, and I promise your body will reap the rewards. Many positive choices over the long-term are much healthier for you than perfect choices that only last a short time. These summer fitness tips are quick and effective for maximum results with minimum sacrifice and commitment:1. Multitask Your WorkoutIn the water you can accomplish your cardio, strength training, build your lung capacity and meditate -- all at the same time. Swimming is the perfect antidote to the heat and minimizes stress on joints to avoid spending a summer on the sidelines because of an injury.2. Balance and Tone Your ShouldersShoulder stability is key to any workout that involves the upper body, especially swimming. You can prevent injury and get shoulders you are proud to bare in your tank top by externally and internally rotating your shoulders with moderate resistance. I recommend using a stretch cord or small dumbbells with your arm bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep the resistance moderate and work up to 2-3 sets of 15 on each side. 3. Crunch Your CoreBut not just any crunches! Strengthen your oblique muscles (the ones that criss-cross your belly and help you do the twist) by lying on your back with your hands behind your head. Keeping your right leg extended straight, lift your left knee toward your face as you twist your right elbow to touch your left knee. Then switch. Never let your head, arms, or legs rest on the ground in between reps. Keep your abs engaged the whole time. Do 20 reps (10 on each side, alternating). 4. Fly Like SupermanA strong back is sexy and healthy. While lying on your stomach on a mat, extend your hands straight over your head with your thumbs up. Keep your face looking down. Lift both your arms and your legs off the ground using your back muscles (your nose will be hovering an inch off the ground). Then lift your right arm and your left leg a couple inches higher keeping your arms and legs straight. Alternate this move and do this for 15 seconds to start. You'll eventually build up to several rounds of 30 seconds at a time. In addition to your backside, you'll like what this does for your glutes as well.5. Lift to Lighten UpWeight training helps slim your body, not bulk it up (despite the stigma to the contrary). To get that envious ""swimmer's back"" and define your arms for swimsuit season, alternate between 15 repetitions of seated lat pulls and 15 repetitions of seated rows, both with medium weight. Train your way up to three rounds per strength workout. 6. Recharge Body and SoulTo refresh mentally and soothe sore muscles after a hard workout, stretch, rest and practice yoga. I've found yoga amazing for my flexibility, toning, and sense of calm. Swimmers in particular should focus on shoulder and upper back opening positions. 7. Moisturize Your Skin From the Inside Out Easier to come by than any miracle cream is good old-fashioned water. Unlike sports drinks, water quenches your thirst and hydrates your skin free of charge (and calories). Active adults, especially in the desert, need three to four liters of water per day. 8. Keep it HotDance... make love... or both! Yes, you read that right. These activities are an important part of any fitness regime. I call them ""cross-training."" They are intense calorie-burning activities that work a lot of muscle groups at once. These activities help us stay motivated, because we are reminded of how great are bodies truly are. They also don't feel like a work out and release wonderful endorphins that help us to feel good.When trying any of the above ideas, make sure to have fun. Do what feels good and mix it up! You'll be more likely to stick to it.For more on fitness and exercise, click here."

The so-called Great Migration, which can also be seen in the northern Serengeti, has been attracting safari-goers since it was set off by a population explosion in the 1960s credited to the destruction of rinderpest, a cattle plague that had kept herd numbers low.This massive spectacle is currently underway.Though travelers may not have heard of this huge event, anyone who has ever spent a few hours under the spell of the Discovery Channel has assuredly seen pictures: The Mara River crossing has provided videographers with footage of crocodile and lion attacks for decades. The river becomes such a dramatic setting during the migration, that it is now the centerpiece of many safaris.The mass movement will linger in the Mara through fall, but it might be best to go now to catch the tail end, as it were, of the Mara River debacle and stay among the animals inside the park. The trip also offers a great excuse to visit both Kenya and Tanzania -- the animals observe no boundaries -- two similarly beautiful countries with vastly different if equally engaging cultures.Travelers feeling particularly adventurous can tack a Kilimanjaro climb on to the end of the trip.

Kwiatkowski, originally from Michigan, is charged with causing a hepatitis C outbreak involving at least 30 patients who were treated at Exeter Hospital's cardiac catheterization lab. Massachusetts police said Kwiatkowski was found intoxicated along with a suicide note in a hotel room in Marlborough, Mass., the week before his arrest. Officials said he also had worked at hospitals across the country, including facilities in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania.

It is passed through contact with contaminated blood, often through shared needles.Authorities, when they charged Kwiatkowski, called him a ""serial infector.""Exeter Hospital responded on Thursday to a stinging assessment of its practices by the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid, some of which showed how Kwiatkowski may have been able to commit his alleged crimes.The Center slammed the hospital for failing to meet many safety measures, including securing narcotics such as the ones Kwiatkowski used on himself.The 18-page report, based on an assessment made in June, noted that hospital staff routinely left certain medications unsecured.Other violations included not cleaning equipment between patient uses, employees with potentially infectious or draining wounds working in patient care and lack of precautionary gear against infection worn by employees when entering patients' rooms.The document said one employee was asked to leave work areas several times because his wounds were bleeding, or seeping fluid. Kwiatkowski was not named in the report.Exeter Hospital said on Friday that it was making policy changes in response to the report.""The hospital has thoroughly addressed each finding,"" officials said in a statement. Under new procedures, for example, ""once filled, syringes are locked up by a nurse until the moment they are needed and only then are they unlocked.""Most changes had already been made in the past two months. The final one was to be put in place by Aug. 26.To ensure the changes are enacted, state health officials will make spot checks of the hospital in the coming months, said New Hampshire Bureau of Licensing manager John Martin.Over the next few weeks clinics in southern New Hampshire will test over 3,000 patients treated at certain units of Exeter Hospital between April 2011 and May 2012.Before coming to New Hampshire, Kwiatkowski, 32, a native of Michigan, worked as a radiology technician and in cardiac labs in over a dozen hospitals in seven states from 2007 to 2011.A class action lawsuit and separate negligence complaint were filed in late July against Triage Staffing, the healthcare agency that hired and placed Kwiatkowski at Exeter Hospital.Domenic Paolini, a Boston attorney, filed the lawsuits against Triage and said the critical HHS report could open Exeter Hospital up to litigation as well.""This is going to open up many, many more lawsuits against Exeter Hospital,"" even cases not related to the hepatitis C outbreak, Paolini added.

We have deemed their choice inferior to ours, but we will take the high road and tolerate them.",2012-08-10,love info-text graphics and arrangement concept on white background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1eab2400003200531477.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I had a dream a couple nights ago. A mysterious figure was speaking to me about the meaning of the word ""tolerance."" The voice instructed me to wake up, get out of bed and write down the content of my dream, but I refused, certain I would remember everything. When I awoke, however, I went about my day remembering nothing of the dream. A couple days later an email arrived with this quote by Gandhi. ""Tolerance,"" Gandhi said, ""implies a gratuitous assumption of the inferiority to other faiths to one's own."" All at once my dream came crashing back into my awareness as I hurriedly scribbled down notes of the memories flooding my mind. I'd never considered the word ""tolerance"" before. The dream drew my attention to the power of the words we choose, as well as a deeper issue. Tolerance may sound like a welcome reprieve from the intolerance millions have suffered throughout history, and considering the magnitude of violence committed due to intolerance it is significant progress. But in 2012, have we not evolved beyond merely tolerating other people and groups we don't agree with? Perhaps it is time for us, as both individuals and collectively, to aspire to something far more benevolent and loving. What is implied when we say we are ""tolerant"" of another person or group's beliefs, lifestyle or choices? When we declare we are tolerant there is an air of judgment and superiority, as if we are putting up with someone or something we don't approve of. We have deemed their choice inferior to ours, but we will take the high road and tolerate them. From this vantage point we assume the role of judge and jury, determining our verdict of quiet disapproval. If we focus on what we perceive as our differences and merely tolerate others, where is the love? Our humanity depends upon a shift in the way we perceive and relate to others, as well as ourselves. Why is it threatening when someone disagrees with our choices? Ultimately, focusing on our differences only creates separation from each other. Without connection there is no unity; thus, love disappears. Have we forgotten our connection to one another? In the words of Mother Teresa, ""If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."" We are all human beings, regardless of our age, gender, race, sexual preference, culture, religion, or beliefs. Our commonalities far outweigh our differences. We are all undergoing the universal experience of being human; we understand what it feels like to love and care for others, to feel the pain of loss and to hope for a bright and safe future for our children. When we lose our ability to love our neighbor as we love ourselves we create an invisible wall around our hearts that serves as a fortress to our humanity and compassion. Underneath our feelings of righteousness, judgment, criticism, intolerance, superiority and, yes, even tolerance, lies the energy of fear. Consider the eloquent words from Arthur Japin's Lucia's Eyes: ""If you accept others as equals, you embrace them unconditionally, now and forever. But if you let them know that you tolerate them, you suggest in the same breath that they are actually an inconvenience, like a nagging pain or an unpleasant odor you are willing to disregard.""Accepting everyone as equals is the key. The truth is we are all equals and therefore deserve to be recognized as such by the law and each other. The legalizing of gay marriage is an example of intolerance by some, mere tolerance by others and acceptance by many. Each of us is worthy of the same rights and compassion as the next person, regardless of our race, religion, gender or sexual preference. This isn't a gay issue; this is a human rights issue. The question isn't: ""Should we legalize gay marriage?"" The question we should be asking is: ""Why haven't we legalized gay marriage?"" This issue brings forth deeper questions about our humanity and the honoring of one another; it is about equality, acceptance and love. We all share an unlimited capacity for love and kindness, which is demonstrated globally every day. The examples of people dedicating their lives to help others are endless, but unfortunately the examples of intolerance are endless, too. The energy in which we choose to align ourselves will determine our future personally and collectively. But only the energy of love expands our hearts and accepts all people, uniting us as global brothers and sisters, in one extended family.For more by Suza Scalora, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

The Australian couple complained to staff, and would not accept another pair from business class, so they decided to leave the plane. Passenger Angela Ceberano told the paper that the plane broke out in laughter when the captain made the announcement they would be delayed: ""He said: 'Just to inform you all, the reason we've had the delay is because two of our first class passengers refused to fly on this plane as there was no extra large pajamas on board for them.'""After waiting 30 minutes to offload the pair's bags, the flight departed and was able to make it to Australia on schedule.

Passengers of all stripes do crazy things though, not just people in first class.

American gymnast Jordyn Wieber wrote in a blog for People.com.U.S. track and field star Sanya Richards-Ross echoed the sentiment -- the night after winning a gold medal for the 400 meters, she said she only got four or five hours of sleep before returning to the track for another day of semifinals, according to ESPN.com. ""[My family] kind of celebrated until about 2 this morning. Everybody kept saying, 'Go to sleep, go to sleep, you have to run tomorrow,'"" she told ESPN. ""Even when I laid down I couldn't sleep. I was just so excited."" (She ultimately placed fifth in the 200 meter final a few days later.)And swimmer Dara Torres told Health magazine earlier this year that she sometimes turns to medicine to help her conk out the night before the race. ""There are a lot of athletes who will take it if they need to fall asleep before they compete -- because you're thinking about your race and you're tossing and turning,"" she told the magazine. ""I'll take an Ambien if I'm having a really hard time going to sleep.""So what, exactly, makes it so hard to sleep in the Olympic village? It's likely a variety of factors, experts told The Huffington Post, including jet lag, a changed environment, nerves and all that excitement (The Duchess! Tweets from Justin Bieber! LeBron!).""Nothing in our body is random,"" says W. Christopher Winter, M.D., medical director of the Martha Jefferson Hospital Sleep Medicine Center in Charlottesville, Va., who is working with several athletes competing in London right now. And because the games are only every four years, it can be difficult to know exactly what to expect. ""You can't be particularly seasoned in the Olympics,"" he adds. (OK, unless you're Michael Phelps.)And that means that the out-of-towners who can't afford to spend weeks re-acclimating to London time could find themselves at a disadvantage, fighting against their circadian clocks by eating, training and, yes, sleeping against their natural schedules. On top of that, as anyone who has tossed and turned in a hotel bed can attest, sleep can be disrupted in a new, unfamiliar environment. We all naturally wake up several times throughout the night, Winter explains. In our own beds, we typically drift back to sleep without even noticing -- away from home, though, we might be disoriented for a few minutes, which can ultimately disrupt sleep. Plus, we all pick the mattresses, bed covers and sheets that make us feel comfortable at home, but that level of customization isn't usually available on the road. (It's no mystery, according to Winter, why the home team often sees a boost in medal count, as they don't need to make any of the same adjustments.)Add all that to the immense pressure to sleep the night before competing, and you have a recipe for disaster.""Sleep is like men having sex,"" jokes Joe Ojile, M.D., founder and CEO of the Clayton Sleep Institute in St. Louis, Missouri and a board member of the National Sleep Foundation. ""If they know they have to do it, it becomes very difficult.""The phenomenon is hardly unique to the Olympics -- earlier this year, for instance, Knicks forward Steve Novak told a radio host that the team was having trouble sleeping in the wake of 'Linsanity.' ""We have a lot of guys who have trouble sleeping at night,"" he said at the time. ""I'm serious. It's like the energy when we leave -- it's like it's midnight, and you go home and we can't sleep.""And yet sleep is critically important to athletic success. ""Nobody performs well when they're sleepy,"" Winter says. ""It's almost like asking why is eating important with athletics.""The human growth hormone is secreted during deep sleep, he explains, which is essential for recovery (especially when you're brutally competing day after day). And Ojile adds that quality rest is key for both immune function and focus -- particularly crucial when hundredths and thousandths of a second are on the line.""It doesn't take much of an advantage for a bronze medalist to become a gold medalist or someone off the podium to get a bronze,"" Winter says. ""Sleep's kind of everything.""So what, exactly, is a sleepless athlete to do? Both experts agree that getting quality rest is a skill that can be learned. And part of that, Ojile says, comes down to the basic sleep hygiene: avoiding technology and bright lights in the bedroom, and winding down at night, whether that means meditating, reading a non-stimulating book or finding some other relaxing activity. ""Their adrenaline is going to be so high, they have to overcome that,"" he explains.Winter also recommends doing what you can to make your environment feel more familiar -- he tells patients, for instance, to spray lavender, which promotes sleep, on their pillows at home, even if they don't have any problems with insomnia. Then they can spray that same scent on their pillows while traveling as a sort of brain trick.And he tells athletes to take the pressure off sleeping.""Sleep is incredibly important and incredibly important to your health but a night of sleep is somewhat meaningless,"" Winter says. ""I tell athletes all the time, I want you to care about your sleep a lot, but I want you to worry about it a lot less than you are right now.""And by not dramatizing it -- putting a few lost hours in the same category as, say, skipping a meal -- you might actually end up sleeping better. Tell yourself: ""If it doesn't go well tonight, it's not that big a deal,"" he suggests."
