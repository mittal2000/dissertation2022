Many residents have continued to complain of ailments. But the researchers say they don’t know how Flint’s water could still be causing rashes since the city switched back to more stable Lake Huron water in October 2015. “Fortunately, water samples from the city’s current water did not show metals and minerals at levels that would cause or make rashes worse,” Dr. Nicole Lurie, of the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.“Residents who are still suffering from rashes or hair loss or have other health concerns should visit a doctor or a community health center for care and possible referral to a dermatologist,” Lurie said. People in Flint noticed problems with the water immediately after the city started pumping from the Flint River in a state-approved plan to save money. The river water was discolored and the city struggled to control problems with bacteria as well as chemical contaminants used for fighting the bacteria. It turned out the biggest problem was state regulators failed to ensure the water was treated to prevent it from corroding the city’s lead pipes. Last fall, doctors reported Flint kids had higher levels of lead in their blood. Lead exposure can cause permanent brain damage, and the revelation prompted the state of Michigan to reconnect Flint to the Detroit water system, which uses Lake Huron as its source. The regional director of the federal Environmental Protection Agency resigned in the wake of revelations that the government knew of the problem earlier last year, as did several state officials. Nine state and local bureaucrats have been charged with crimes. Lead levels in Flint’s water have since declined, but the government still advises residents to drink only filtered or bottled water. Despite rash complaints, officials have maintained that the water is safe for bathing. This year, actor Mark Ruffalo, one of many celebrities who rallied to Flint’s cause, led a high-profile (and scientifically dubious) campaign challenging the government’s bathing assurances. For its rash research the government interviewed 390 Flint residents who’d complained of skin problems, and took water samples from 170 homes. Nearly half said their rashes started after October 2015, when the government says the water’s chemistry has been stabler and “does not contain metals and minerals at levels known to be associated with skin problems.”“We concur that the water quality testing performed on current water was quite comprehensive and did not find any abnormality that could cause or worsen rashes or hair loss,” said Dr. Walter Barkey, a Flint-area dermatologist who worked with federal researchers. “We also concur that the marked fluctuations in pH, hardness and chlorine while the Flint River was the water source could really explain the most common type of rash found in the study which was eczema,” Barkey said. Flint residents: Does your water seem like it’s getting better? Tell us about it ― email arthur@huffingtonpost.com. Please include your phone number if you’re willing to be interviewed."
2,BLACK VOICES,10-Year-Old Has Nightmares After He Says Cops Pointed A Gun At Him,Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-year-old-nightmares-cops-point-gun_us_57bdb473e4b00d9c3a1b12bf,Patisha Solomon said her son is lucky to be alive after being chased by Newark police officers.,2016-08-24,"Legend Preston, 10, said he was chased down and held at gunpoint by Newark police.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bdd0e71700000011c752f2.jpeg?cache=WN7GlXhQkD&ops=crop_0_121_540_348%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Patisha Solomon’s son, Legend Preston, has been having the same nightmare since Aug. 11 for several nights. In the dream, a group of police officers chase him down and shoot him in the leg. Unfortunately, this recurring nightmare is a reflection of his reality.About two weeks ago, the 10-year-old was playing basketball near his home in Newark, New Jersey, when the ball rolled away towards a police car sitting in his neighborhood. Legend went to retrieve it but when he looked up, a group of cops were coming towards him with guns drawn, Solomon told The Huffington Post. She said her son instinctively ran. The mom, who was in her home during the incident, added that neighbors and friends who witnessed what was going on formed a human barricade to shield her son and told the police that Legend was a child.The cops said Legend “fits the description” of a man who they suspected committed an armed robbery ― a 20-year-old man with facial hair and locs who they caught shortly after the incident, according to Solomon. When the mom confronted the police, she said they were smug, told her to go file a report and walked away without an apology. The mom uploaded the video below on Aug. 13, of her son after the incident occurred. With tears streaming down his face, Legend answered his mom’s questions about what happened. “They tried to shoot me,” he responded after his mom asked him why he was nervous.“Who tried to shoot you?” Solomon asked.“The cops,” Legend responded, hanging his head. The Newark Police Department told WABC that the cops didn’t point their guns at the young boy.NPD didn’t respond to HuffPost’s request for further comment. Solomon told HuffPost that unlike in her son’s nightmare ― and in reality for so many other black people who have been gunned down in this country ― the cops didn’t pull the trigger and, fortunately, he’s still alive to tell his story. The same day of the incident, the mom took her son, who has two siblings, to a hospital where they diagnosed him with “abnormal fear.” Unsatisfied with the doctor’s response, Solomon said she plans on taking Legend to see a counselor. She said her son is now afraid whenever he sees a police officer and that his recovery process hasn’t been pretty but they’re taking it “day by day.”“Legend was sitting there the other day and he was like, ‘mommy, I know my name is Legend and I always wanted to be special or be on TV but I wish it would’ve been for when I got to be really good in science or playing sports... I didn’t want to be on TV for this reason.”The mom told HuffPost that after reaching out to the police department and mayor’s office a number of times, she’s still awaiting a response from officials. She said at this point, she’s looking for more than an apology.“There needs to be [a] change in policies, there needs to be reform in the police system, there needs to be proper and updated training and these police need to be taught some type of... the best way I can put it is bedside manner,” she said. “You cannot come and police a community like that.”"

I can shove him off to ya?” one man says off camera, apparently talking to the hungry whales.Someone else comes to the seal’s defense: “That guy deserves to live!”Nick Templeman, the tour guide who was manning the boat, said the seal hopped onto the vessel following a long cat-and-mouse chase with the orcas.“This seal was tossed around a few times and taken under quite a bit before seeking refuge among the boats in the area,” Templeman told CBC News. “He got close enough to see us and beelined for the boat.”A GoPro camera stuck in the water indeed captured a couple of the determined whales as they prowled below the surface.“The orcas kept sounding and coming up right behind the boat, searching,” Templeman said.According to Kirk Fraser, who uploaded the YouTube video, the drama went on for about half an hour.The seal “fell [off] three times in panic and finally stayed on until the whales gave up after about 30-45 minutes,” the video’s summary reads. “Most intense epic experience ever.”It’s not clear what the boaters eventually did with the seal. But Templeman told CBC that “the seal is the survivor” ― suggesting the little guy lived to swim another day."
4,POLITICS,North Carolina Agrees 'Bathroom Bill' Is Hurting The State's Reputation,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-bathroom-bill_us_57bde436e4b085c1ff26fa04,And it's dragging down the Republican governor's reelection chances.,2016-08-24,"Museum Manager Jeff Bell puts up a gender neutral bathroom sign in the 21C Museum Hotel public restrooms on May 10, 2016, in Durham, North Carolina.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57be13e11800002100bcce8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While North Carolina residents are divided on their approval of the state’s controversial “bathroom bill,” the majority of them agree that HB2 has succeeded in one area: making the Tar Heel State look bad. A poll by the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute released Wednesday found that slightly more than a third (36 percent) of likely North Carolina voters polled in a multi-question survey supported HB2, while 55 percent disapproved of the law. Nine percent had no opinion.Yet regardless of their personal attitude on HB2, a whopping 70 percent of respondents said the law has had a “bad” or otherwise negative impact on North Carolina’s reputation nationally. Compared to a poll by Public Policy Polling in April, Wednesday’s poll from Monmouth shows sentiment toward HB2’s perceived impact has grown steadily more negative over the summer. Passed in March, the bill prevents local governments from protecting LGBT people by cutting off the ability to pass local anti-discrimination policies that go beyond the state standard.Most notably, the bill has a provision that prevents public places like schools from allowing transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds to their identity.The bill drew swift backlash from the business and entertainment world, and even other states condemned it.Shortly after the legislation passed, more than 90 prominent business leaders from companies including Apple, Facebook, Airbnb, Yahoo, Twitter, Salesforce, Marriott, Pfizer and Levi Strauss signed a letter calling on Gov. Pat McCrory (R) to repeal the law entirely. Prominent public universities rebuked HB2; PayPal scrapped a plan to expand in Charlotte, which would have brought 400 new jobs; and the NBA pulled the All-Star game from the state. Cities like Washington, D.C., San Francisco, New York and Atlanta banned government-sponsored travel to the state. McCrory has staunchly defended HB2, but his support of the law could be hurting his reelection prospects. Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, McCrory’s challenger, has been leading the incumbent by between 6 and 9 points in recent polls. Voters polled by Monmouth revealed they’re split on how good of a job they think the governor has done for state residents: Forty-five percent approved of the job McCrory has done, while 46 percent disapproved.“McCrory is trying to take control of the HB2 debate with a new TV ad,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement Wednesday. “As of right now, though, North Carolina voters feel it has hurt the state, which is helping Cooper’s bid to unseat the incumbent.”"
5,MEDIA,AP's Bombshell Clinton Foundation Report Comes Under Scrutiny,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/associated-press-clinton-foundation_us_57bdf2a8e4b04193420cf6c6,The campaign is identifying likely names on the donor list the news outlet isn't ready to reveal.,2016-08-24,"The Associated Press wrote that the overlap between those who gave money to the Clinton Foundation and those who met with the secretary of state ""fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57be029d1600002900bfe361.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign fired back Wednesday after a major Associated Press report raised serious ethical questions over ties between the State Department under Clinton and her family’s charitable organization, with Clinton’s team arguing that the AP data was woefully out of context.The AP found that of the 154 meetings Clinton held with private officials (i.e., those not in the domestic or foreign governments), 85 of those were with people who “gave money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation.”The finding set off a round of criticism aimed at Clinton for blurring ethical lines and granting access to friends and high bidders. But in the hours that followed, questions began to mount about the presentation of the AP story.The AP got called out for a misleading (and widely shared) tweet accompanying the report that made it appear that half of all Clinton’s meetings ― not just those with private officials ― had taken place with foundation donors. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias challenged the broader thrust of the AP’s story even further, arguing that the AP framed its findings as more scandalous than they warranted. Though Yglesias acknowledged that potential links between Clinton’s State Department and the candidate deserved scrutiny, he argued that donors who apparently received preferential access actually deserved it and were pushing unobjectionable, noble causes.The Clinton campaign quickly circulated the Vox article, in addition to noting that some of the relationships that the AP highlighted ― including one with Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Prize-winning Bangladeshi economist ― existed before Clinton’s tenure at state.Their frustrations with the AP story didn’t end there, however.Aides to the Democratic nominee say that the AP has not given them the actual list of the 85 foundation donors who the outlet says got access to Clinton while she was at State, making it hard for them to rebut charges that she engaged in quid-pro-quos. But on Wednesday, they began filling in the holes.“We have applied the AP’s criteria on our own, cross-referencing publicly available donor info with publicly available schedules of her meetings,” the campaign’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, told The Huffington Post.Among the names of people they believe the AP is referencing are the late Nobel Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, former NBA star Dikembe Mutombo and actor Ben Affleck. The latter two have parlayed their fame into global philanthropy campaigns and humanitarian efforts. The Associated Press declined on Wednesday to disclose the list of 85 people who it reportedly identified as having donated as much as $156 million to the foundation. “We are still reporting on them ― cross-referencing information and so on,” AP Director of Media Relations Paul Colford told HuffPost, adding that the news organization is “not done with the names yet.”That is well within their rights, considering how hard the outlet worked to get the data. Along with publicly available information, the news wire based Tuesday’s report on new details about Clinton’s State Department schedule that it obtained after suing the department last year. So far, the AP has received Clinton’s more detailed schedules for half of her four-year tenure.The AP broadly defended its work Wednesday in a statement published on its website. The news organization, Colford wrote, “has been transparent in how it has reported this story.”Colford added that the AP hopes to obtain the remaining two years of Clinton’s detailed schedules at the State Department before Election Day."
6,SPORTS,Here's The Hollywood-Worthy Rio Gymnastics Story You Didn't Hear,Chloe Angyal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houry-gebeshian-armenian-american-olympics-gymnast_us_57bddfede4b04193420cb68d,Houry Gebeshian's story belongs on the silver screen.,2016-08-24,Houry Gebeshian poses during a training session before the start of Olympic competition.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Houry Gebeshian appears to be living in a Hollywood screenplay. Her life resembles a gymnastics version of the 1993 cult football classic “Rudy,” complete with training montages, unlikely mentors, against-the-odds triumph, and lasting glory.This month, Gebeshian became the first female gymnast to represent Armenia at the Olympic Games, had the best meet of her life and ensured that the uneven bars mount she invented will bear her name for the rest of gymnastics eternity.She did all of this at the elderly-by-elite-gymnastics-standards age of 27. After coming out of retirement to take a shot at the Rio Games. While working full time as a physician assistant at the Cleveland Clinic.The training montages basically make themselves. And they come with a sweeping backstory and a compelling emotional arc: a family on the run from violence, immigrant parents working hard for their kids to have better lives, a young woman determined to change the patriarchal culture of the nation she fought to represent. Oh, and there’s a love story, featuring a supportive boyfriend who believes in her dream and also happens to know how to treat her injuries.Someone option this thing already.Gebeshian’s grandparents fled the Armenian genocide in 1915, moving to Lebanon to escape the violence. A generation later, her parents fled the Lebanese civil war, moving to the U.S. to escape that violence. A generation after that, Houry, born and raised in Massachusetts, would apply for Armenian citizenship so that she could compete for the small Eurasian nation.Gebeshian started gymnastics at 5 years old, working her way up through the competition levels. By the time she was a high school sophomore, she was competing at the Level 10 national championships, and soon, college coaches came calling.She went to the University of Iowa, and it was during her sometimes-rocky, occasionally disappointing college career, she told Flo Gymnastics, that she realized “I’m actually a pretty good competitor, and I can compete with the best on the stage.” She won the gold medal on beam at the NCAA national championships in her junior year and represented the Hawkeyes in the all-around at nationals in her senior year.In 2010, as she was getting ready to graduate with a degree in athletic training, she started thinking about the 2012 Games. The U.S. talent pool was exceptionally deep, and her chances of making that team were slim, but Armenia has no elite women’s gymnastics program to speak of.Countries with small gymnastics programs, or with weak programs that do not field whole teams or place highly if they do, can be eligible to send a single gymnast to the games, as nations like India, Australia and New Zealand did in Rio. Gebeshian secured Armenian citizenship, and began training with an eye to competing in London under the Armenian flag.She went to the World Championships that year, the first step to qualifying for the games. “I was a little bit starstruck because I was thinking, ‘Wow, I am competing in the same arena with the best gymnasts in the world,’” she told Flo Gymnastics. And it showed in her performance: she finished just one spot shy of qualifying for the Olympic test event. Gebeshian was given an alternate spot, and left in the uncomfortable position of quasi-hoping that a fellow gymnast would get sick or injured and have to drop out. No one did. She was crushed: “I felt like my life was over.”She decided to quit. “I left the sport, I decided, I’m not going to do this anymore,” she told The Huffington Post, speaking from Rio the day after the closing ceremonies. “Life’s not fair.” And so she began her life without gymnastics, her life as a normal person.She enrolled in a master’s program in medical science at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, and this is where the sports movie finds its romantic subplot. While on a practical rotation in Cleveland, Gebeshian met a podiatric surgeon and they fell in love.As she tells it, it was her now-fiance, Duane Ehredt Jr., who urged her to go back into the gym. “He was like, you know what, I think it’s possible you should try and compete again at the elite level, like, why not? Nothing’s stopping you,” she said. She was skeptical: “I was like, please, I’m overweight, I haven’t done gymnastics in three years, there’s no way.”But he was persistent, insisting that the logistical challenges ― the cost of training, the need for her to continue building her medical career ― could be overcome. “The more and more we talked he was like, ‘Come to Cleveland, you can find a gym here, you can find a job here, I’ll be here, we can make it work,’” Gebeshian said. “So he kind of convinced me to start back up again.”Which is exactly what she did. She moved to Cleveland and found a job at the Cleveland Clinic, and, with the goal of making it to the 2015 World Championships and qualifying for the Rio Games, she found a gym where she could train, Gymnastics World. So far, so good. Still, by this time, she was 25 years old, over the hill by gymnastics standards. (The average age for women gymnasts in Rio was 20). She was out of shape. And she was working full time in a surgery theater. And the owners of the gym would let her use their equipment, but they didn’t have an elite program, which a gymnast typically needs to compete at the Olympic level. So, knowing an elite program was out of financial reach and believing that Gymnastics World could meet her needs, she decided to coach herself.“At first I thought, ‘Oh, my God, what am I doing?’” Gebeshian said. “I started from zero, literally.” In the beginning, she was too rusty to even do gymnastics. “I couldn’t do anything,” she said. “I had to get back into shape. I took the first three or four months and just did strength and conditioning and cardio, just to slim back down.” The owners of her gym were supportive ― when the former NCAA gymnast walked in and told them she wanted to go to the Olympics for a nation that had no gymnastics team, she said, “They were like, ‘OK, go for it.’”Still, she was on her own: “I didn’t have a coach. I was training myself.” And, she was funding herself, working full time to afford training and, eventually, travel and meet registration fees. During this time, Gebeshian was working from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day, learning everything she’d need to know in the operating room. (Now, she works in labor and delivery, and crams all her shifts into two days, working a 24-hour shift and a 16-hour shift.) She’d work a full day at the hospital, and then she’d go to the gym for four or five hours. Were there moments when she thought she might be delusional to be doing what she was doing? “Absolutely,” Gebeshian said. “I would come home some days and be crying to Duane, ‘Why am I doing this?’” The people around her might have thought she was kidding herself, too. “The first couple of months,” she said, “everyone was probably looking at me like, ‘Who is this girl? What is she thinking that she’s going to be an Olympian and she can’t even do a cast to handstand on the bars?’” Ehredt was a motivational force, and his professional skills came in handy as well. Gebeshian had a lingering foot injury that was causing her pain just as she began attempting her comeback, in 2014, “and so he took care of me, and he resolved the issue. It was good to have him right there.”Going back to the gym required some pride-shelving, as Gebeshian got her body back into shape and then started attempting tricks and routines again. “It was so embarrassing,” she said, “and I would come home and be like, ‘Ugh, gym was terrible, everyone was looking at me like I was a weirdo.’”But it paid off. “It was a process,” Gebeshian said. “I made a plan and I stuck to it, and it took a lot of determination and dedication and discipline, and it worked out.” And, for the young girls who were watching her, it was an education. “I think it was really great for the kids at the gym, because they got to see somebody who had a goal and was determined to make that goal happen,” she said. In Gebeshian’s eyes, the fact that she had to start from scratch only benefitted the younger gymnasts who shared the gym with her. “It was actually a good thing that I looked like an idiot when I started,” she said, “because they could actually see the transition and see what it takes.” Joan Ganim, the co-owner of Gymnastics World, agrees. “She’s been such an example to all my students, because she’s showing determination, she has such a great work ethic, and she pushes herself without anyone telling her what to do.”By the time the 2015 World Championships in Glasgow were approaching, the Armenian coaches knew about her, though they weren’t helping her out with funding. “They didn’t know who I was, they didn’t know what I could offer,” Gebeshian said. “Which I understood, and I said, ‘Fine. I will prove to you that I am someone who is legitimate.’”To give her a chance to prove that she could handle competing on the world stage, they sent her to the 2015 European Championships. She could, indeed, handle it; she placed 19th. Now, still working full time (slogging through round-the-clock shifts several days a week in the labor and delivery department), she started looking ahead to the World Championships. She competed in Glasgow and placed 68th, strong enough to qualify for a test event in Rio, where she again placed high enough to qualify for the next event. And the next event was the 2016 Olympic Games.For her trip to Rio, she was assigned an Armenian coach, though not a coach of women’s gymnastics. His expertise was in the men’s side of the sport, and “he didn’t know women’s gymnastics that well,” Gebeshian said. He was largely assigned to her because he spoke English, “and he was really supportive,” she said. “He turned out to be really helpful.”How is this story not a screenplay yet? Because if this were a screenplay, you’d tell the writer to cut one of these obstacles from the heroine’s journey, because it’s all starting to be a bit much. Did Gebeshian ever worry that she wouldn’t make it? That she would get hurt, or embarrass herself at the biggest competition in the world, or do more damage than good to the cause of women’s gymnastics in Armenia?“I really didn’t,” she said. “I had two goals. One was to get me to the Olympics, and the other was to get Armenia to the Olympics. I knew there were going to be obstacles, but I knew what I had to do to get there.”And in Rio, Gebeshian had the best meet of her life. She competed in a fan-designed leotard – white, with a mountain range drawn out in crystals, a tribute to Armenia – and stuck all four of her routines. She performed her signature mount on bars, jumping over the low bar, completing a full twist in the space between the low and high bar, before grabbing the high bar and launching into the rest of her routine. As she was the first person to perform it in an international competition, it will forever be named after her. When her bar routine was over, she hugged the bars. When her beam routine was over, she kissed the beam.She didn’t perform well enough to qualify for all-around finals, but that didn’t diminish what she’d accomplished. She became Armenia’s first-ever female Olympic gymnast, and, by creating a new skill, advanced the sport of gymnastics. The miserable months of conditioning had paid off, and the outlandish announcements that she was going to be an Olympian had come true.Gebeshian’s story has all the hallmarks of stirring propaganda about the power of the American dream – you know, bootstraps, stick-to-it-ness, ignoring the doubters. Asked if it struck her that her story sounds like a classically American one, even though she competes for Armenia, she says she can see the echoes of the American dream in what she’s achieved, but she credits her upbringing “as an Armenian woman,” too. “That dedication and determination and discipline, that mix of being an Armenian-American is really what pushed me to get here,” Gebeshian said. “It’s a mesh of both cultures. I really think that it took both.”Still, she’s found far more support in the U.S. than she has in Armenia, where women’s gymnastics, she said, is woefully underdeveloped. “We don’t have any funding going to our women’s program,” she said. “It’s still a very male-dominated society, I would say.” The men don’t get extravagant support either, Gebeshian said, but what little money goes to gymnastics goes to them. “I think it’s just evolved that all the funding goes to the men, and on the women’s side it’s more a recreational program and they don’t have the coaching or the resources to build anything,” she said. Gebeshian wants to change that. “The reason why I did this is to get more recognition and support and funding for women in Armenia, especially in the gymnastics community,” she said. “So I hope that I can give back, and all the funds that I’ve raised through my GoFundMe will go to that.”But if she wants to do that, it’ll once again be up to her. She met with the Armenian president while in Rio, and asked him for help. Gebeshian said he was not helpful: “I said, ‘This is my goal, this is what I really want to do, how can we make this happen?’” His response? “He was like, ‘Well, you’ve done a good job starting this, it’s on you to make it happen.’”She tried to convey that she was hoping for some government support, arguing that there are talented young gymnasts already training in Armenia, who could make it to the world stage if given some funding and coaching. “And he said, ‘You get a team together and make it happen.’ I’m not sure how I’m supposed to do that, but that is my goal,” Gebeshian said. “I guess all the weight is on my shoulders.”The president’s response is disappointing, to be sure.

As the death toll climbed and the country reeled from the disaster, Pope Francis postponed a planned portion of his weekly general audience to lead thousands of pilgrims through a prayer in St. Peter’s Square.“I had prepared the catechesis for today, as for all Wednesdays during this year of mercy, focusing on the closeness of Jesus,” Francis said, according to Vatican Radio.“However on hearing of the news of the earthquake that has struck central Italy, and which has devastated entire areas and left many wounded, I cannot fail to express my heartfelt sorrow and spiritual closeness to all those present in the zones afflicted.”The pope then invited those gathered in the square to join him in praying “the sorrowful mysteries,” a portion of the Rosary prayer.“I ask you to join me in praying to the Lord Jesus, who is always moved by compassion before the reality of human suffering, that he may console the broken hearted, and through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, bring them peace,” the pontiff said.The earthquake struck roughly 85 miles east of Rome, causing severe damage in the Italian regions of Umbria, Lazio and Marche. The town of Amatrice in Lazio was virtually flattened by the disaster.Francis dispatched six of the Vatican’s firefighters to aid with rescue efforts and help civil protection workers search for survivors in the rubble.The pontiff went on to say in his address: “Hearing the mayor of Amatrice say that the town no longer exists, and learning that there are children among the dead, I am deeply saddened.”"

On Wednesday, the company announced the purchase of U.K. rival AstraZeneca’s antibiotics division for $1.575 billion plus royalties to bolster a part of Pfizer’s business that’s been hurt by expired patents.The deals mark a departure from Pfizer’s attempts in the last two years to merge with rivals in low-tax Britain or Ireland in hopes of dodging taxes in the United States. Instead of boosting its bottom line by skirting taxes, Pfizer is trying to do better at what it’s meant to do: make and sell pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Pfizer aggressively tried to buy AstraZeneca outright for $119 billion. Last year, Pfizer was at it again, bidding up to $160 billion to buy Botox-maker Allergan and move to Ireland, a favorite offshore destination for corporations to store their cash.Such schemes, called “corporate tax inversions,” essentially allow a company to absorb a smaller competitor in another country, then adopt the acquired firm’s citizenship in order to lower their taxes. On paper, the U.S. has a high corporate tax rate, but loopholes and generous tax breaks lower that number dramatically.The average effective tax rate for companies is 27.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent for most other developed economies, according to estimates by the Congressional Research Service. For big companies, which can spend lots of money on lawyers and accountants to structure their businesses to be “tax-efficient,” the number is even lower. A survey of 288 corporations, including most Fortune 500 companies that turned a profit between 2008 and 2012, paid an average federal tax rate of just 19.4 percent during that period, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.In April, hastily passed rules by the U.S. Treasury Department ― seemingly tailored specifically to spoil Pfizer’s deal ― forced the company to ditch its plan to move abroad. But analysts at the time warned The Huffington Post that the new regulations didn’t go far enough to prevent Pfizer or others from trying to finagle similar deals in the future. For now, at least, the rules have made tax inversions less attractive. Pfizer, founded in Brooklyn 167 years ago by two cousins who invented the antibiotic oxytetracycline, can use its deep pockets to get better at producing better drugs for sick people, not bigger stock dividends for shareholders.

The swimmers initially said that they’d been pulled out of a cab and robbed at gunpoint, but security footage from the gas station disproved this claim.In a lengthy statement, Feigen admitted that he made a mistake by “omitting facts.”“I was trying to protect my teammates and for this I apologize,” he said. “I would like to apologize for the serious distractions from the Olympics, Rio de Janeiro and Team USA.” The real story appeared to be that a gas station worker, who had a gun, confronted the athletes after Lochte pulled a sign off the wall. Lochte also admitted that he “over-exaggerated” after he alleged that men who claimed to be police officers held a gun to his head.Feigen denied authorities’ claims that he and his fellow athletes broke down the gas station’s bathroom door ― an incident that was not seen in security footage. Police also said the swimmers damaged a mirror and a soap dispenser. Read his full statement here. The swimmers could face serious punishment over their behavior, including a suspension or ban from the sport. Lochte has already lost at least three sponsors over the controversy."

Two CIA-contracted psychologists accused of helping create the CIA's torture program are suing the agency for documents about the program's inception.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bce3801700001108c75086.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The two CIA-contracted psychologists accused of crafting the spy agency’s so-called “enhanced interrogation program” want the U.S. government to turn over documents they hope will show the torture program wasn’t their fault. The motion to compel the documents, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday, alleged that the CIA and Justice Department had been uncooperative in supplying James Elmer Mitchell and John “Bruce” Jessen with “documents critical to their defense.”Their request is related to a separate ongoing lawsuit in Spokane, Washington, where the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of three former CIA detainees, is suing Jessen and Mitchell for their alleged role in creating and implementing an interrogation program that used techniques now considered to be torture. The pair was hired by the CIA as contractors in 2002, as the agency was rounding up individuals suspected of having ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban and interrogating them in secret black sites around the world. Jessen and Mitchell’s company ultimately collected $81 million for their work. The two psychologists have argued that they should have immunity from prosecution over the enhanced interrogation program because it was authorized by the executive branch during a time of war.Mitchell and Jessen initially sought to have the lawsuit against them thrown out ― which is what has happened with past attempts to hold the CIA legally responsible for its torture program. But Senior Judge Justin L. Quackenbush of the Eastern District of Washington ruled in April that the case would continue and ordered both sides to begin discovery, the process of exchanging evidence before trial. That’s where Mitchell and Jessen ran into problems. According to the motion filed Monday, the subpoenas they submitted to the CIA and DOJ in June requested approximately 30 categories of documents. Back-and-forth correspondence between the government and lawyers for Mitchell and Jessen follows the same pattern, the motion alleged: “The Government claiming that it wants to provide Defendants with information, but is unsure how it can provide such information or when.” The government has said that the psychologists’ request is overly vague and burdensome, ostensibly because of classification issues in documents related to the CIA’s now-defunct torture program. In lieu of providing Mitchell and Jessen with the documents they have requested, the government has proposed “alternative and creative options,” the motion said. One option proposed by the CIA is to provide an anonymous witness who could answer questions in writing that could be used in court about the duo’s role in the torture program.Lawyers representing Mitchell and Jessen rejected that option, “in part, because of the uncertain evidentiary value of such an affidavit and deposition,” the motion said. The court in Spokane, where the torture victims are suing Mitchell and Jessen, has set a discovery deadline of Feb. 17, 2017, although a list of expert witnesses and trial witnesses is due at the end of the year. The case is scheduled to go to trial next June. "

Defenders of the ban claim it protects women who would otherwise be harassed for visibly being Muslim, while critics denounce it for taking away a woman’s right to choose how she dresses.Banning women from wearing burkinis in public “goes against democracy and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in every way,” Nekkaz said. “It’s deplorable.”Nekkaz views the duty of paying fines as a way of “neutralizing the law” while still respecting it.“I want to de-dramatize the situation,” he said. “There’s no choice but to pay these fines. But these women are suffering and France’s spirit of vivre ensemble [the concept of living together harmoniously] suffers too.”He said he even asked the mayors of all 26 towns that enacted the ban to send fines to him directly so he can pay them on behalf of all women. “I contacted every local police department and the national police, who is tracking the fines, but none wanted to meet,” he said.France’s government has defended the bans, claiming they were enacted in order to protect Muslim women.

The area is named for Mount Katahdin, which is Maine’s highest mountain and is located within the adjacent Baxter State Park.Katahdin Woods and Waters is open to the public 24 hours a day, year-round, according to the Portland Press Herald. It’s currently free, but the paper notes that the National Park Service could potentially charge entrance fees in the future. Activities like camping, hiking, kayaking and skiing are allowed throughout the area, but hunting and snowmobiling are permitted only in select parts.Learn more about visiting the area here.A video from the White House showcases the region’s beauty and notes that the president has helped conserve hundreds of millions of acres of land.Many conservationists are characterizing the news as a win for nature, but not everyone is thrilled with the decision.The land previously belonged to Roxanne Quimby, one of the co-founders of the personal care company Burt’s Bees. Quimby and her family have been trying to get the property converted into a national park for years, but have faced opposition from some local residents for a variety of reasons. Some want the land available to be used in the forest products industry ― an enterprise that once thrived in the region but has been steadily spiraling downward for years. Other locals don’t want to see activities like hunting and snowmobiling curbed. And some people simply don’t think the federal government is competent.That’s one reason the area ended up as a national monument rather than a national park, the Portland Press Herald reports.National monuments are similar to national parks — both are federally protected and managed. But while a national park can only be created through an act of Congress, a president can designate a national monument unilaterally through the power of the Antiquities Act of 1906. And according to the Press Herald, Quimby and her family couldn’t get Maine’s congressional delegation to introduce legislation to make the area a park.That said, plenty of Mainers do support the decision. The Natural Resources Council of Maine, the state’s leading environmental group, is “thrilled” with the decision, executive director Lisa Pohlmann told Maine Public Broadcasting.“We can think of no better way to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service than with the addition of the wonderful Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument,” she said.CLARIFICATION: The National Park Service will manage the new national monument in Maine. An earlier version failed to point out that national monuments are managed by a variety of federal agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management."

And yet, the common writing instrument has delivered unto the world an artistic genre all its own, defined by crisp lines, glistening ink, that piercing royal blue hue.Since its invention in the late 19th century, the ballpoint pen, in all its unpretentiousness, has been used to create some extraordinary artworks. Alberto Giacometti, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon are among the big names to have explored its many powers. However, the most miraculous works to come out of the ballpoint tradition are by artists who may never have created any artwork at all had they not had access to these affordable, ubiquitous, humble writing instruments. A book titled Ballpoint Art by writer and art historian Trent Morse delves into the knotty, highly detailed world of pen art. “In a way, ballpoint ink diminishes the distance between artist and audience,” Ignacio Uriarte explains in the book, “because everybody has used it and knows how the artwork is done and how it feels to do it.”Throughout its pages, the book features the work of Iranian born artist Mehrdad Rashidi, who fled Iran at 20 years old for political reasons and settled in Germany. In 2006, at 43 years old, he began to draw, doodling on shopping receipts, old notebooks, and whatever scraps he could get his hands on with increasing compulsion. Another self-taught artist who uses ballpoint pens is Indonesian artist Noviadi Angkasapura, who, at the age of 24, encountered what he describes as a supernatural creature in a waking state.

Supposedly, we treat animals better than we’ve ever done before. At this point, over half of all households in the US own a pet and the pet industry now nets over US$60 billion annually.As well as spending billions on toys and novelty outfits, Americans are spending US$23 billion on pet food and US$15.4 billion on veterinary bills annually. In a free market this is not really that surprising or harmful (if you forgive the extra consumption on a planet already ruined by human overconsumption alone), but, what can’t be forgiven or overlooked, is the US$2.1 billion spent every year on live animal purchases, the majority being domestic dogs and cats.While pet adoption continues to rise in popularity in the US, due to increased knowledge about the rising population of stray animals, buying pets is still an accepted action, with 28% of all pets being purchased from breeders and over 70,000 new domestic animals being born each week.The ‘invisible’ problem of stray animalsIt’s easy to assume that if you don’t see stray dogs or cats on your streets then your city or town doesn’t have a problem. In reality though, within most developed countries, its more likely that the issue is invisible, with stray dogs and cats being dealt with swiftly, picked up by local authorities and charities as soon as they’re sighted. The speedy removal of these animals from the eyes of the public, however, is worsening the situation, and creating public denial or sheer ignorance of the plight of thousands of abandoned dogs and cats culled each year in overflowing animal shelters.Yearly in the US, 7.6 million abandoned and lost pets wind up in shelters (roughly, 3.9 million are dogs). While the upside to this is that a third of this number are rehomed and many are reunited with their owners, the downside is that another 2.7 million are euthanized each and every year. That’s 2.7 million stray dogs and cats that could’ve been rescued if the public weren’t so unaware of the problem.This is by no means just an issue for North Americans, and in many countries across Asia, it has become a very visible problem handled much less efficiently. In Europe, the situation is again often an invisible one, particularly within wealthy nations such as the UK. It is calculated that there are around 100,000 abandoned and stray dogs at any one time in the UK, with 50,000 being ditched every year by irresponsible owners. With shelters and charities already stretched, this has meant that approximately 14 dogs are culled each day in the UK.In Romania, one of the poorest countries in Europe without the robust infrastructure to hide behind, it is estimated that the stray dog population sits around 600,000, and, in the capital of Bucharest, there is almost one stray dog for every 31 Romanian people.How is this acceptable? Why can’t welfare laws disrupt the free market? Why aren’t more people aware that this is an issue caused by humans and yet also one that is easily prevented by humans?Puppies for sale and the insidiousness of ‘cute’ Breeding animals has become, by consumer demand, a billion-pound industry, and, like all billion pound industries, there are a great number of people wanting in on the profits. Despite welfare laws, many breeders act outside of the law, breeding without licencing and advertising through classified advertisements or word of mouth. While many breeders are reputable and honest, the lure of easy money and the inability to police all breeders, leaves much opportunity for exploitation, particularly in places without robust animal cruelty regulations.Despite illegality in many countries, so-called ‘puppy mills’ are commonplace around the world, catering to market demand, and are notorious for treating domestic animals as breeding machines in order to turn hefty profits. Just like poor, exploitative conditions for human workers means cheaper products and quicker profits for the company, puppy mills exist under the same principle; cut costs on care and quality and you will make more money, social responsibility and welfare laws be damned.Sadly, often when consumers buy into the pet industry, both in stores and from unknown breeders, they are rarely allowed a true look into the ‘manufacturing’ process of their pet. Just as how meat-eaters will often not know how their meat was prepared, many people buying pets remain wilfully ignorant of their pets’ origins. Or, perhaps worse, they prefer to see themselves as ‘saviours’, rescuing their new pets from hot, lonely shop windows or other bad conditions.This only serves to strengthen an industry which profits heavily from the weakness people have for ‘cute’ things, such as puppies and kittens (a weakness known in the marketing industry as ‘kinderschema’). This predilection is not such an awful thing in and of itself, but when it comes to the commoditization of young animals marketed to impulsive and unprepared buyers, our societal weakness for ‘cuteness’ is one we need to be aware of and attempt to control.The importance of spaying Of all the animals which enter shelters in the US, only 10% have been spayed or neutered. This percentage is markedly lower in poorer countries and means that while these animals are stray, the production of unwanted animals continues, perpetuating an already huge problem.Homeless or not, if just one unneutered dog has a litter of puppies, this can theoretically lead to the births of 67,000 dogs in just six years. An unneutered cat and a litter of kittens is even worse – capable of creating 370,000 cats in just seven years.Somewhat ironically, in the minds of some people across the world, in Asia in particular, spaying is considered inhumane and cruel. Remembering that five out of ten shelter dogs and seven out of ten shelter cats are killed however – totalling almost 80,000 each week in the US – should be more than enough to convince you that spaying is crucial.Adopt, never buy: here’s why…Regardless of whether you have, or know someone who has, bought a pet, it is so important that we as a society move away from paying into an industry which profits from breeding domestic animals. Instead, we have a responsibility to help reduce the number of perfectly healthy, loyal and tame stray animals that are culled every year as a result of humanity’s blasé consumer habits.And it’s not just a matter of animal welfare, it’s also about sustainable economics. Despite the fact that the US is home to somewhere in the region of 70 million stray dogs and cats, an additional 70,000 cats and dogs are born every day nationwide. On top of the two billion dollars Americans are spending on new pets each year, they are paying a further two billion in tax for the government to shelter, kill and dispose of unwanted and stray animals. This is a cycle of breeding, spending and killing which really makes humanity look senseless as well as wasteful.But education is key and common sense is the solution. Tell your friends and anyone you know about the importance of pet adoption, neutering and never getting drawn in by ‘puppies for sale’ advertisements. Remember, cute doesn’t necessarily mean harmless and buying pets only worsens the problem.Learn more about pet adoption on The Shelter Pet Project website, which can help put you in touch with local shelters and pet adoption agencies.Other educational organisations include The Humane Society, An Act of Dog and the ASPCA."

Interestingly, Stein is polling less than 1 percent in Florida, where the same political puritanism elected George W. Bush (Bush beat Al Gore by only 543 votes in Florida. Gore needed Florida’s electoral votes in order to win the presidency) and helped create the world we live in today. I definitely understand and sympathize with your position, but at what point do you become pragmatic, if not with Trump? Sarah Palin? David Duke? Marine Le Pen? Mussolini? Hitler?”First of all, let’s clear up a widespread misconception. Gore did not lose to Bush because of Ralph Nader. He lost for three reasons: he could not win his own home state; over 300,000 Democrats in Florida voted for Bush; and, ultimately, it was the Supreme Court who decided the presidency. Nader received the same amount of votes (about 1%) from both Democrats and Republicans, so he really made no impact whatsoever on the outcome. Gore’s loss was his own doing; it had nothing to do with people voting for a third party candidate.Trump could be considered a multi-millionaire version of Nigel Farage, Marine le Pen, or Geert Wilders. But even those vile far-right-wing populists can at least put two coherent sentences together and have some idea of how a government works. Trump doesn’t have the first clue. In the unlikely event (given his ever-increasing self-destruction) he wins the presidency, and assuming he wouldn’t resign as soon as he is sworn in (at which he has hinted), he would just be a bumbling, ineffectual figurehead of a president while Congress continues to do its job. Any crazy ideas he tried to implement would be blocked by Congress, particularly if people elect better congressional candidates.Would you rather have a president who says evil things or who does evil things? Hillary Clinton is actually the greater evil, given her track record. Trump’s speech is abhorrent; but Clinton is far more dangerous, with a history of implementing actions and policies that have led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands. And her far greater experience in government will be effectively used to promote more wars around the world. It’s good for business.Clinton’s intervention in Libya, for example, in which 80,000 people were killed or wounded, has been a significant factor in the destabilization of the Middle East — the very destabilization that has given birth to ISIS and increased acts of terrorism worldwide. This is a woman skilled at working a corrupt political system, who has proudly called war criminal Henry Kissinger her friend.In Honduras, U.S. support of the military coup there when Clinton was Secretary of State has brought nothing but chaos and death, including the murder of Berta Cáceres, an environmental activist opposed to her government’s raping and pillaging of their land.According to the NGO, International Rivers, “We must note that during the 2009 military coup in Honduras, the US government, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, worked behind the scenes to keep Honduras’ elected government from being reinstated. Additionally, the US government continues to fund the Honduran military, despite the sharp rise in the homicide rate, political repression, and the murders of political opposition and peasant activists.” It leads one to wonder how badly Clinton would treat U.S. activists driven to protest.According to an article by David Sirota and Andrew Perez, “under Clinton’s leadership, the State Department approved $165 billion worth of commercial arms sales to 20 nations whose governments have given money to the Clinton Foundation.” This includes the sale of arms to the Saudis — a country that is not exactly the paragon of human rights.A vote for Clinton is essentially putting a stamp of approval on all the above. Trump is the symptom, not the disease. Voting for Clinton will only ensure a continuation of the conditions that created Trump in the first place. Trump is the result you get when the corporate-owned government policies entrenched in our two-party political system rob the citizenry of the wealth their labor has produced, and to which they are entitled.The neoliberalism Clinton espouses is the very ideology that has created massive wealth inequality, environmental destruction, and a loss of democracy. Chris Hedges noted that “fascist movements build their base not from the politically active but the politically inactive, the ‘losers’ who feel, often correctly, they have no voice or role to play in the political establishment.” And thus, the rise of Trump.Candidates like Trump will keep popping up in future elections if we keep voting for the status quo. If we do not abolish this corrupt two-party system by voting for third party candidates, our choices will only get progressively worse. It’s at this point that my friend’s fears will be proven: Clinton or another neoliberal candidate will be run against the likes of a Sarah Palin, a David Duke, or eventually someone possibly approaching the evil of Hitler.Next time, the Republican candidate might be someone like Cruz — a far more dangerous candidate than Trump because Cruz (or any other neoconservative) not only promotes the twisted right-wing rhetoric that would return America to the dark ages, he has the political and intellectual capacity to enact his policies. Trump doesn’t. Trump has little support even from his own party.It is not “political puritanism” to want the candidate you vote for to truly represent your interests. Why should we vote for one of the two vile candidates chosen for us when we have other choices? — other choices the two major parties don’t want you to know more about. The mass media will never give exposure to those third parties because the media is part of the corporate system.Jill Stein is a voice of reason in a field of impossible candidates. We need a president and Congress that are not part of the corporate-owned establishment. Stein’s views match my own. She is calling for a halt to costly military intervention, advocates universal health care (seriously, who doesn’t want that?), free public universities (just as in other developed nations around the world), the establishment of racial justice, and most importantly, the protection of our fragile environment. I truly can’t understand why anyone who cares about the future of their children would not want those things.A vote for Stein is a powerful voice saying you will not be strong-armed into voting for someone who is beholden only to the highest bidder. You are standing tall for the right of you and your children to live in a world with less armed conflict, where healthcare and education are a human right. A world in which we can work together to bring the earth back from the brink of ecological disaster.Or not. Your choice."

Mylan acquired the product in 2007.“Although the antitrust laws do not prohibit price gouging, regardless of how unseemly it may be, they do prohibit the use of unreasonable restraints of trade to facilitate or protect a price increase,” wrote Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who said her daughter relies on an EpiPen.“The FTC should investigate whether Mylan Pharmaceuticals engaged in activity, such as using incentives or exclusionary contracts with insurers, distributors, or pharmacies, to deny an alternative product access to the market.”An EpiPen injects a pre-measured dose of epinephrine (adrenaline) that people use if they are having a dangerous allergic reaction.The FTC did not say whether an investigation was under way. “The commission takes seriously its obligation to take action where pharmaceutical companies have violated the antitrust laws,” a spokesman said.Mylan did not immediately comment on the letters but noted in an email that nearly 80 percent of people with commercial insurance who use a savings card can get the medicine for free.“With changes in the healthcare insurance landscape, an increasing number of people and families are enrolled in high deductible health plans, and deductible amounts continue to rise. This shift has presented new challenges for consumers, and they are bearing more of the cost,” Mylan also said.The FTC opened a probe into Turing Pharmaceuticals for possible antitrust violations in connection with the company’s decision to sharply raise the price of a life-saving drug. Turing had raised the price of Daraprim to $750 a tablet from $13.50.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editig by Steve Orlofsky)"

During an interview with People magazine, Legend shared how his mother’s past drug abuse and prison stint ultimately tore a part his family. “As a teenager growing up in Ohio, I watched my mother deal with depression and drug abuse after my maternal grandmother – a person who filled our whole family with love – passed away,” he said. “My mother’s addiction didn’t just tear her life apart. It tore me and the rest of our family apart, too.” The 37-year-old went on to add that his mother “didn’t need punishment” in the form of being incarcerated, but instead, “she needed help” to address her depression and drug abuse. Legend suggests investing more resources into preventing American citizens from being incarcerated, instead of “investing our resources in locking people up.”Legend professed his optimism for a change to the inequalities of America’s justice system before during this year’s 47th Annual NAACP Image Awards.“Today, communities of color are still being crushed by a criminal justice system that over-polices us, over-arrests us, over-incarcerates us, and disproportionately takes the lives of our young people because of the simple fact that our skin conjures the image of threat and violence,” he said during his acceptance speech for the President’s Award.“Despite the daunting problems we face I am hopeful that our generation will demand and achieve radical change in our lifetime.”Read more of John Legend’s People interview here, and watch clip from the “My Potential” initiative below."
