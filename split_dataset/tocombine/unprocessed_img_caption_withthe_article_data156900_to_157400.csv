0,TRAVEL,10 Reasons for New Yorkers to Visit Boston This Summer,"Julie Gerstenblatt, Contributor

But one thing New Yorkers know are the reverberating ripples of influence a terrorist attack brings not only on a city and its people, but also on its economy as a whole. Let's keep the city vibrant. Here are 10 attractions in and around Beantown.",2013-04-23,"Financial District in Boston, Massachusetts, with Charles River.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d12bf1f00002d00217825.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am a New Yorker. In November 1998, my husband and I were married at Windows on the World, the famed restaurant on the 106th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center. Our wedding occurred on a perfect fall day, crisp and clear. We exchanged vows as the sun set. The red and pink glow gave way to a spectacular nighttime cityscape dotted with lights that stretched for miles.I love my city.On September 11th, 2001, when the towers fell, I spent several difficult hours reassuring my seventh grade students at Scarsdale Middle School that their parents who worked in New York City were almost certainly fine. Safe. On their way home right this minute.But, of course, I didn't know that for sure.Meanwhile, my husband was part of the city's pilgrimage, walking uptown, towards my mother's apartment. We were both unable to get home to Brooklyn.New Yorkers have known terror. We have known the sadness, uncertainty and loss particular to such an atrocity. We live in a city that, like Boston, was attacked in two distinct, choreographed blows.Tower one. Tower two.Explosion one. Explosion two.Boston has been on all our minds this past week. Nationally and internationally, the story has touched people's hearts and moved them to action.But, as New Yorkers, we really get it. Don't we?Boston is on a path towards healing. But one thing New Yorkers know -- and that Bostonians are about to discover -- are the reverberating ripples of influence a terrorist attack brings not only on a city and its people, but also on its tourism, its real estate market and its economy as a whole.And so, this summer, I propose that New Yorkers, en masse, visit Boston.Let's keep the city vibrant, its restaurants and shops bustling, and its hotels filled.Think of it: historic walks, great pubs, and local accents that put ours to shame! All of this can be yours when you visit Boston.To make planning the trip easier on you, I have compiled, with the help of my Boston-based, hip, 20-something cousins, a Top 10 list of attractions in and around Beantown. In trying to be creative, I have purposefully avoided most of the obvious touristy things that you probably already know about, such as The Freedom Trail and Faneuil Hall  although some touristy attractions had to make the list.1. Exercise. Tour the city on bicycles by taking the Hubway instead of the subway. This bike-sharing system throughout Metro-Boston lets you unlock bikes set up at docking stations all around town. You can join for a 24-hour pass or a three-day access pass.2. Play ball. Attend a Red Sox game on July 19th, 20th, or 21st... when they play against the Yankees, of course! I won't tell you which team to root for, but I will tell you to grab a great meal before or after the game at Island Creek Oyster Bar. (That's ""Baaah."") (Love oysters? Want a real New England experience? Then visit the farm where these come from and boat along Duxbury Bay. 3. Appreciate art. Like your culture with a side of tequila? Visit The Institute of Contemporary Art, which offers a ""First Friday"" event for 21 and up. ""Art goes overtime on the first Friday of the month with guest DJs, live performance, gallery talks, specialty drinks and more. The ICA's Water Café will offer a small plates menu and full bar, including cocktails inspired by the museum's current exhibitions."" This event does sell out, so get your tix in advance here:4. Shop. Visit Boston's original Art and Indi Design Market! ""Celebrating its 10th year, the SoWa Open Market® is the hip and happening place to be on Sundays from May to October! The market is located outdoors in the vibrant SoWa district in Boston's South End and includes an extensive arts/crafts section with a rotating group of indie makers and designers, an award winning farmer's market and a collection of the yummiest food trucks around. To round out your Sunday, within walking distance you'll find a vintage market, artist studios, galleries, shops and many of Boston's best restaurants.""5. Enjoy music. Speaking of outdoor activities, why not have dinner and drinks along the waterfront followed by a concert at The Bank of America Pavilion? This summer, see Sting, The Go-Go's, LL Cool J, The xx and Grizzly Bear...and many more. 6. Bring the kids. Travelling with young children? Then visit The New England Aquarium, The Museum of Science and/or The amazing Children's Museum.7. Eat. You don't need to travel overseas to enjoy unique culinary experiences. Head to Stir, a demonstration kitchen and cookbook store for cooking lessons from Top Chef Winner Kristen Kish. Foodies will also love Craigie on Main. The burgers are apparently out of this world, but since the restaurant only serves 18 each night, you better line up early for this elusive piece of perfection.8. Set Sail. Go sailing along the Charles River. You can pretend you are a Winklevoss rowing crew for Harvard.9. Wine and dine Italian style. Dinner and dessert in the North End is a must. My kids live for the Whoopie Pies at Mike's Pastry, but my cousin prefers the cannoli at Modern Pastry. Heck, have both.10. Act like a tourist. I must conclude this list with my favorite childhood memory of Boston, taking a ride on the Swan Boats in the Public Garden. Read Make Way for Ducklings and the ""Trumpet of the Swan"" to your children before making the trip to this beautiful 24-acre park. Follow it up with a fancy, kid-friendly meal at The Four Seasons and then shop along Newbury Street."

You see, I wasn't home. I was waiting for my credit card and the pair of sandals I just bought. I was at a Tory Burch store. As I left through the high gloss, orange doors, I started thinking about how so many higher end retail shops are designed to make you feel like you're home -- or what your home would feel like if you were that designer. It makes the shopper linger more, but it also tosses in an added dose of aspiration... Smart. But, here's the thing. I'm much more into being inspirational as opposed to aspirational. So, I decided to take that overall look of the store, which I think is impeccably decorated, and create a living room around it. Classic, modern, fun and full of color! The budget would be smaller, the timeline would be tight, but this is what I do. So I gathered a bunch of photos from the Internet and picked out the things I liked best from each image. I liked pink more than orange, I love gold metallic, I like white high gloss. Also, I'd add some more accessories and electronics since this is a home, not a store.The room already had hot pink wallpaper on two walls and a muted gold on the other two. Since I was working off a color palette of pink, orange, gold and green, this was a pretty good starting point. I added the signature white seating, a chic green and white graphic rug, some faux bamboo pieces, a little DIY, a few techy add ons and some vintage pieces like glassware and a bar cart. The end result was fabulous, colorful, modern and just a very happy and glamourous room.  This look is really about starting with big, classic pieces and punching up the style with details. And when you're using that many brights, it can go from fabulous to all kinds of crazy in a couple of moves. The key is to really stick to the color palette, clean lines and keep the details chic.

His classmates have been interviewed. They are surprised, taken aback and alarmed that their quiet classmate had slowly been transformed into a foot soldier.Youthful zealotry, unchecked, is dangerous. Eighteen-year-old's make great soldiers because they have less fear and more idealism than they will again.My children, not born into a dismal Chechen village, were not transplanted into a new country and culture. They have the benefits of parents, family and roots. They were not primarily raised by a disgruntled and poorly assimilated older sibling. Yet, they still grapple with what is good and bad and wrong and imperfect in this world. Because they are supposed to, they are young adults.My children are thinking about their world, their choices. And by so doing, they are engaged in developmentally appropriate tasks. I provide them with endless missteps, things that I do that should be done better. I think of myself as a cautious person. I never snorted coke, I didn't like being drunk, I go for annual physicals and I don't intentionally eat butter. I also think of myself as socially conscious. I compost and recycle. My children, while thirty minutes away, Boston was on the verge of lock down, outed me as a rule breaker and a fascist.Here's how my comeuppance went down:""You will lose your arm should the airbag engage."" I am gliding around town, one handed driving, listening to the incessant coverage of the marathon bombing. Town is moving in the aftermath of shock, when nothing really focuses but life picks up and keeps going. I am thinking bombs and terror, when Sadie tells me that if I had a wedding ring on, like many women wear, my forehead would be gouged when my arm snapped back, air bag, engaged.""Mom, I didn't mean the wedding ring thing to be insulting...""""One handed driving is more dangerous than two?"" I make small talk. But all I can think about are the innocent lives taken, friends and families affected.""Yes, you need parallel hands, at all times."" Sadie stares at the road while I feel around with my free hand for my chap-stick. The radio lists hospitals where victims of the bombing are being treated.""What, what are you looking for, you're like a kid!"" Sadie's bag is packed, her wallet organized. She knows where her chap-stick is. She shakes her head in disapproval. We hear on the radio, that the hospitals were prepared for an act of terror. The doctor being interviewed had worked in Israel; he had seen bombing victims, many, many times.Briefly, we stop squabbling and listen.""Mom, do you know you're tailgating?"" The blue car with the Romney sticker in front of us is going too slowly.""I am not."" The radio lists gruesome facts about lower extremity injuries, the shattering of flesh by projectiles.""You are. You can't see underneath the car in front of you.""""That's the rule?"" I don't like that rule, it also makes sense, as rules can. I'm rushing to Starbucks. I'm rushing away from the news on the radio. I listen for days on end.Later, Gabe comes in from the car, he's been running errands and doing very helpful things for me. I am grateful. However, I forgot to clear my Starbucks evidence from the car. I'm watching the news. The sister of the boy from Dorchester, the one whose picture holding a sign about peace, is on the television, his sister has lost her legs. Both of them.""Mom, you know that driving all that way to get tea is incredibly wasteful."" Gabe hands me my Starbucks cup.""I so enjoy their tea..."" The little sister was an Irish step dancer. Her mother has a head injury. They were a family who went everywhere together. I see that, from the pictures. They are happy. A happy group. They were.""Mom they don't practice fair trade, they suck."" Gabe looks at me like I'm a stranger, with no moral compass. I drink tea sold by a money grubbing company. The little sister will dance again a manic newscaster predicts. She will?The news droned on and on about the youngest bomber eluding the police, running over his brother, killing a police officer. And then, Boston was in lock down. Not since the Boston Strangler escaped had Boston been in lock down.I mute the television and look at my children.I beam. They are safe, for the day. I beam bigger and they ask, what? What's wrong? Gabe with his Starbucks's frown, Sadie with her organized bag, I am so proud of them. They are both capable of making good choices for themselves and the earth. They are smart, questioning, skeptical and critical, true to their developmental task. They are situating themselves to go forth and do better.How does one young person become a terrorist and another work for Greenpeace?By sharing their ideas with adults who listen and care? By being engaged in conversations where many ideas and different perspectives are explored? By learning that tolerance is next to godliness? Civics classes, literature classes, history classes -- these are places of rich discourse and intellectual growth. Adults are important because we can offer insight, and ideally, tolerance. We have lived longer and we are (hopefully) mellower for it. We have a handle on nuance and the lack of absolutes when it comes to ideas, concepts and politics. It takes a village, it takes more than one adult, it takes many, to nurture and care and listen and encourage a child into adulthood.The youngest bomber is a young adult, an idealist and a ripe receptacle. He was also perfectly dangerous, because he had no counter-balance to his brother's ideas. He didn't have another adult who could point out that change takes time, that violence does not create change. What if he had talked to another adult, a professor a coach, he had many of both, people who cared for him, what if he had reached out to one of them, or they to him? Just one conversation could have changed everything. Everything would be different and the big brother and the little Irish step dancing sister, they'd be eating dinner together."

The Thatchers' daughter Carol told Moore that her father was approaching his 50th birthday and running the family paint business, Atlas, when work pressure caused him to have a breakdown, The Telegraph reports. He was ""genuinely knackered,"" Carol reportedly told Moore, adding that her father ""didn’t like every aspect of being married to a politician.""

He died in June 2003, at age 88. Lady Thatcher, who married Sir Denis in 1942, would come to rely heavily on her husband during her 11 years in power. “I could never have been prime minister for more than 11 years without Denis by my side,"" she wrote in her autobiography.

Students in Massachusetts were on spring break last week, so when they resume their routine tomorrow, we need to assess the impact of the tragedy and create a plan that restores a sense of security.Over the years, I have learned that delicate decisions before the students enter the classroom can make a huge difference. Educators who walk like they have gold in their pocket can create an atmosphere that exudes the relief after a storm, the soothing comfort of a shelter, and the reassurance of a tight community. Educators without a clear plan can inadvertently communicate the sense of a rabbit caught in headlights.While this kind of crisis is dramatically different from a snow day, some of the same principles apply. There is a chain of communication around snow days and a predictable protocol, and this kind of approach can be very useful while debriefing from a crisis with multiple moving parts. If a community is paralyzed by a blizzard, teachers and students talk about it. But in times of tragedy, sometimes adults think if they don't say anything that kids won't ask questions. As educators, it is critical to address our own anxious feelings -- fear of gathering, fear of danger, fear of our own prejudice -- before we enter the school. Our task as educators and counselors and parents is to push away our own fears so that our children feel a sense of safety and security while still acknowledging the enormity of the tragedy. When school adults ignore children's curiosity and their need for explanation, they can make things worse. It is critical to provide information and explain policy changes in order to settle parents' fears. Kids can process heartbreaking news as long as it is communicated in a caring and developmentally appropriate way. I have seen children tolerate bad news and find relief when words express the unspeakable. Silence, on the other hand, can be deafening.Sometimes school adults get anxious about reassuring students because they are worried that that they are projecting a false sense of confidence. Adults, after all, are people too. We are human. Our knowledge is limited. We don't understand everything that has happened. But we educators need to be mindful that we don't communicate our own bewilderment to our students. We need to be careful about using language like ""always"" and ""never."" We need to regain our balance, seek help from peers or other professionals, and realize that we don't have to soldier on alone. Sometimes during a crisis, there can be a sense of isolation and scarcity. Small acts of kindness go a long way to help us to feel control over our environment and instill a sense of calm. I often see that people are comforted when they find ways to feed each other. When we started an advising group to make sure that every student had a home base at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School, the teachers brought out all the Dunkin' Donuts and fed the students as a way to reinforce connection. Because Massachusetts schools were on April vacation last week, many students will return with variable understanding about what happened. Some children will have been away, while others will have been glued to their televisions as they sat in their apartments, watched disturbing replays of chase scenes and shootouts. Others may have seen their families fight because they were so tense and powerless with cabin fever. Other children may have been sitting with relatives who were injured or grieving because someone died.Teachers must be nimble in adapting to the range of reactions. Parents will have different thresholds for what information they choose to share with their children. Sometimes teachers may ""spill the beans"" and provide too much graphic detail or spend too much class time discussing the disturbing events. It is key to distribute talking points so that the school adults can be all on the same page. This doesn't always happen. We assume that intuition and common sense will prevail, but schools thrive on flexible guidelines that allow for innovation but also provide structure.   When some children and adolescents get nervous or tense, they may make inappropriate comments. It is vital to understand the anxiety underlying the comment and to use it as a teachable moment about tolerance. Some kids may be embarrassed about showing strong emotions or about seeing other people crying, so they try to distract people by making jokes. Other kids may be irritable or angry for no apparent reason. This mood change may indicate that they have been ""triggered"" in ways that are not readily apparent to caring school adults. Some kids may be angry because they felt threatened.It's not easy to find a constructive way to channel anger, but it is critical and can make the difference between a community that moves forward or one that splinters into divided factions. I suggest asking children how they blow off steam when they are upset. For some, physical exercise helps, such as singing, dancing, or breathing. Another helpful technique is to draw angry words on butcher pager, hang it up, and then throw water balloons at it. Even kids who aren't angry like to do this. Community meetings with singing can uplift spirits. Some schools encourage their students to express their feelings through artwork or spontaneous memorials, including floral arrangements. When a school does this, it is useful to set a time line for how long the tributes will stay up. For example, one of my colleagues is thinking about making flower memorials and then using them as part of compost for a garden. It can be helpful to talk with students about how they can support one another. Are there good questions that they can ask each other? Teachers can lead discussions about how the students can take care of each other through shared lunch or a grade-wide sports game. It's also important to encourage the children to speak up if they are worried about a peer. Sometimes kids know that another child is suffering long before the child is on the adults' radar. Tell students what signs to look for such as withdrawal, thoughts of revenge, difficulty sleeping, or mood swings. Tell them how to communicate their concerns with an assigned adult. None of this is easy, but it's important to organize, to communicate, and to have a school-wide plan. Leaders need to evoke a sense of strength and safety for students whose innocence may have been shattered. And remember, if you walk like you have gold in your pocket, soon you will."

As an executive coach, I share in the triumphs and challenges of my clients. One of things I'm really good at is spotting patterns. There are distinct differences between the ways successful happy people approach life versus those who continually struggle. Here are three things happy, successful people do differently:1. They focus on happy jealousy.When a colleague gets promoted or a friend gets a new home, less successful people are jealous because they wish the prize had gone to them instead. Successful people also feel jealous, but it's a different kind of jealousy. Instead of negative envy, they feel what I call ""happy jealousy."" They're happy for the other person, and they wish it had also happened to them, too. The nuance is important. Less successful, less happy people tend to have a scarcity mentality. They believe there aren't enough raises and new cars to go around. When someone else gets a prize, it means less for them. When a friend wins a trip to Europe, they're more likely to get dejected, thinking, ""Well what about me?"" Successful people respond differently. They're jealous, but instead of feeling left out, they ask themselves, ""How can I make that happen for me?"" Rather than sitting on the side complaining, happy jealousy motivates the successful happy people to take action. 2. They don't get defensive about suggestions.As a coach, my job is to help my clients get better results. My best clients welcome feedback and act upon it. Successful people view feedback through a lens of continual improvement. Less successful people have a different lens. They're more likely to interpret a suggestion as a damning, comprehensive, negative judgment on their entire being. For example, in a 30-minute coaching call with a successful, happy person, we can cover four or five issues and they'll walk away with ideas and techniques that they can implement immediately. With a defensive person, the results are much slower. Instead of discussing how they can act upon the advice, they spend their time justifying and defending their current approach, even when it's clearly not working. They wind up getting less help. Meanwhile, while they're defending, the successful person has already implemented three things.3. They analyze their mistakes. Successful, happy people don't enjoy mistakes any more than anyone else. But one thing they do differently is they take the time to analyze their mistakes. Less successful people tend to either avoid thinking about mistakes, or they get mired in them. This comes from a place of fear and insecurity. Less successful, less happy people don't have the confidence that they can shape their destiny.They don't like to face their mistakes because it feels hopeless. Successful, happy people know differently. They're willing to wade through the painful process of unpacking their mistakes, so that they can handle things differently the next time. Ironically, less successful people's unwillingness to analyze mistakes is what keeps them mired in them. Successful people analyze the mistake, learn from it and move on. Look at the above list and ask yourself: What is preventing you from acting like this today? You don't need a good job, a great education, lots of money or the perfect family to start implementing these ideas. The faster you start acting like a happy, successful person, the faster you'll become one. (c) Lisa Earle McLeod Lisa Earle McLeod is a sales leadership consultant.

The explosions, which occurred near the finish line of the 116-year-old Boston race on April 15, resulted in the deaths of three people with more than 170 others injured. Security has been heightened across the nation as the search continues for the person or people behind the bombings. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d10eb2000003000fdd1c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One allegedly violent 19-year-old boy pretty much shut down our fine city of Boston last Friday. Not to mention the terrible damage he and another are believed to have wrought on innocent lives near the marathon finish line on Monday. Now four young people are dead and scores injured as result of the bombing suspects' actions. Why? Will we ever really know? As authorities are working to get to the bottom of this, and prevent similar possible future crimes, let's together strive to get to root causes and origins of our violent society and era, and genuinely do something about it.As our city and surrounding suburban towns were in lockdown, forcing us to hide in our homes and stay off the streets, while the suspect(s) were intensely pursued, I was praying, meditating, counseling people, and holding the victims in my heart. This lockdown is something I have never experienced in this lifetime, even in the Indo-Pakistani War -- with blackouts every night -- or when I lived in India under Indira Gandhi's national state of emergency. What can be learned from this moment? I believe this troubled time calls on us to open our minds and hearts to the innumerable connections we share with others -- in our families, communities, social systems, and on our planet -- and strive to understand what it means to be human now, and why it's imperative that we concern ourselves with the well-being of all others.The power of one is inconceivable; let's harness this strength and energy by empowering ourselves and each other to assume the high road of altruism, peacemaking, collaboration and lovingkindness in action. We are all first responders for someone. Let's remember the power of one.

""What are you afraid of?"" ""I'm afraid that people won't like me."" ""And?"" ""And, that's it. I don't want people not to like me."" ""Let me let you in on a little secret: If everybody likes you, you are doing it wrong.""I cannot even begin to tell you how many times this exchange, or something very close to it has occurred in my office.I am a clinical psychologist. I am in the business of helping people, but I don't believe that just talking is the answer. If you are not out there in the world, trying things, failing at things and learning from your mistakes, then talking is probably just wasting your time -- and I hate wasting people's time.One of the greatest barriers to action is the fear that doing something different, trying to better yourself in some way, experimenting with new ways of acting or being in the world, or just mixing it up will cause people not to like you. ""So,"" you might be thinking, ""What's so bad about having everyone like me? Is it better to have no one like me?"" No. I think we can agree that having no one like you is pretty bad. Either extreme is problematic. ""So,"" you might be thinking, ""If the answer is not to have everyone like me and not to have everyone not like me, what is the answer?""That's a great question, and I'm glad you asked it.The 85 percent Rule The answer is approximately 85 percent. If about 85 percent of the people you meet like you, you are probably doing something right. If it's much less than that, you probably not doing enough to get along with others (a topic for another time and article). In contrast, if much more than 85 percent of the people you meet like you, you are probably doing too much to get along. ""How can I be doing too much to get along with others?""Getting along is great as long as it doesn't come at the expense of yourself. There are nearly seven billion people out there, all with different wants, needs, histories, agendas and fears. If practically everybody you meet likes you, it means that you are probably tying yourself up in knots trying to offer up an inauthentic picture of yourself in order to get along with others. In all likelihood this means that at least one (or both) of these two things is true of you: 1. You ignore your own needs in favor of others.2. You are too afraid of what other people think of you.If these sound familiar, try these on for size:1. If you always put others' needs first, you will, sooner or later not have anything left to give. Learn to be a ""Giving Tree"" not a Giving Cave. A Giving Tree loves to give, but it needs water and sun of its own in order to be replenished, so that may can stand on its own roots. In contrast, once a Giving Cave has been mined, there is nothing left inside of it and it is of no use to anyone.2. If you don't try new things because you are afraid of what other people might think of you, remember this: Those who truly love you will support you no matter what. Those who don't, are not worth changing for anyway. It's what we do that defines what we are. I hope this was of help to you whoever, and wherever you are, and that when, and if, our paths cross, I am fortunate enough to know the authentic you. Odds are pretty good that if you do present the real you, we will be in each other's 85 percent.For more by Ben Michaelis, Ph.D., click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here. "
