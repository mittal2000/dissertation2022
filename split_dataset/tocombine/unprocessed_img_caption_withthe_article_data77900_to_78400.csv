The case drew international attention to the severe discrimination faced by children with HIV in China.Kun Kun has since found a new home, at the Green Harbor Red-Ribbon School in Linfen, China. The boarding school is a rare refuge for HIV-positive children in China, where infection rates are relatively low, but social stigma is high.The school is the subject of an ambitious documentary project called ""Children of the Harbor,"" which is following the students' passage through the boarding school until the first class graduates in 2017.The project was conceived by Bryan Anker, a 27-year-old medical student originally from Los Angeles, who lived at the Green Harbor school in 2012 during an internship at the affiliated hospital. ""It broke my heart to learn that these children had been shunned by society all of their lives,"" Anker told The WorldPost by email. ""The level of awareness these children possess is mind-boggling.

""We want to film up to this point and see what road the students take after graduation. Will they go to university? Will they return home? Will they find a job?"" Anker said.""These children are smart and resilient, and some of them have thought up intricate plans for escaping the HIV stigma in China,"" he told The WorldPost. The school was set up in 2006, and is home to around 30 children and teenagers with HIV, ranging in age from 6 years old to 19. The students have ""very complicated feelings ... about themselves, about the school and about the disease they’ve been carrying since birth,"" Wang told The WorldPost by email.Many of them are the children of patients being treated for HIV/AIDS at the affiliated Linfen Infectious Disease Hospital; others have been orphaned by AIDS or thrown out of their schools and local communities due to stigma.This is a pervasive problem for children with HIV in China. ""If their HIV status has been disclosed, it’s very common that parents of other children complain to the school and force the school to separate their children from HIV positive children,"" Xu Wenqing, an HIV/AIDS specialist at UNICEF China, told The WorldPost by email. Nearly 10,000 children in China live with HIV/AIDS, among some 500,000 reported cases in the country. (Experts estimate the total number of cases, including those undiagnosed, may be around 800,000.) This is relatively low compared to countries like the U.S., which has a population a quarter of the size of China's, and an estimated 1.2 million HIV/AIDS cases among people 13 or older. Yet discrimination is widespread, and affects old and young alike in China. Advocates say people known to be HIV-positive are often barred from attending collge or refused public and private-sector jobs. The main problem is a lack of information about HIV/AIDS, including how it is transmitted and treated. Experts point to China's poor sexual health education and the ongoing repetition of myths about HIV by public officials. China's leaders have made a high-profile effort to combat this prejudice in recent years, as well as stepping up free treatment for AIDS patients and measures to prevent mothers from passing on HIV to their newborn children. In 2006, a new law banned discrimination against people living with HIV, although it has been difficult to enforce. On World AIDS Day last year, China's first lady Peng Liyuan released a music video with the students of Green Harbor-Red Ribbon School, urging an end to the stigma they face.Anker hopes that telling the stories of the children at Green Harbor can convince more people to leave their prejudices behind.""I believe the children’s stories are so poignant, and their personalities so radiant, that our viewers won’t have any choice but to empathize with their situation,"" he said.

6,THE WORLDPOST,Why North Korea's Latest Nuclear Threats Are Like Groundhog Day All Over Again,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-nuclear-weapons_us_55facf48e4b0fde8b0cd2596,"An expert explains why we've been here before, and how to break the cycle.",2015-09-19,North Korea announced that the country's main Nyongbyon nuclear complex was fully operational again this week.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55faf5c520000026002426d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Chad O’Carroll, founder of NK News, an independent news and analysis site on North Korea.North Korean officials sent a defiant message to the world over their nuclear and missile programs this week, as the reclusive regime gears up to celebrate the ruling party’s 70th anniversary.The head of Pyongyang’s space agency said on Monday it was preparing to send a new earth observation satellite into space on a long-range rocket. The U.S. has warned this would violate United Nations resolutions against Pyongyang conducting ballistic missile tests, because of the similarity of the technology involved. Meanwhile, analysts and South Korean officials are skeptical of the announcement, saying there is little sign that Pyongyang is readying a satellite launch.A day later, the director of North Korea’s Atomic Energy Institute announced that the country’s main Nyongbyon nuclear complex was fully operational again and reiterated threats to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. The complex was closed in 2007 during six-party talks with the U.S., China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. But the talks collapsed, and North Korea said in 2013 that it would resume nuclear enrichment. Tuesday’s announcement accords with recent analysis by 38 North, a project of the U.S.-Korea Institute at John Hopkins University, which concluded, based on satellite imagery, that North Korea is “expanding its capacity to mine and mill natural uranium.” The WorldPost spoke to Chad O’Carroll, the founder of specialist news and media service NK News, about what’s behind the latest warning signs from Pyongyang. Did North Korea’s announcements this week about the rocket launches and nuclear reactivation come out of the blue?The statement about the satellite launch did not come out of the blue. North Korea has made at least two or three announcements this year about upcoming satellite launches, leading many analysts to suggest that there will likely be a satellite launch to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the ruling party. This has been a narrative building up to those events.The nuclear announcement did not necessarily come out of the blue either. Pyongyang had already announced that they would reactivate the nuclear processing plant, and that’s been underway for a while. This week’s statement was potentially triggered by 38 North recently publishing satellite imagery that shows activity at the Nyongbyon nuclear complex. The North Korean media may be responding to that, amid the general build-up to the Oct. 10 anniversary.What do we know about the current state of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, and how concerned should the world be about them?The technology for long-range ballistic missiles has not been fully mastered yet. It takes North Korea several weeks, if not months, to set up a satellite launch. So this is not much of a military threat because that's a long window of time for the U.S. to take that threat out.The real threat is two-fold: usage of short-range to medium-range ballistic missiles -- which North Korea has a lot of and have been proven to work -- and low-end applications of nuclear technology.  The problem is that as long as the status quo continues, the better North Korea's technology becomes. Five or six years ago, no one would have thought that in 2015 North Korea would be showcasing submarine technology to launch ballistic missiles.The announcement that they are restarting the nuclear facility is concerning. When plutonium reprocessing was previously frozen there were estimates that North Korea had enough weaponized plutonium for somewhere between five and 12 nuclear devices (depending on the size). It's also possible that there are other uranium enrichment facilities which would be harder to detect with satellite imagery, so the announcement about Nyongbyon could just be a red herring.It’s only been a few weeks since hostilities rapidly escalated with Seoul, before ending in an agreement to ease tensions. How does this square with Pyongyang’s announcements this week?That's the thing that is puzzling -- all of this is comes really soon after an agreement with South Korea to ease tensions.It may signal a repeat of the events of 2012. Early that year, the U.S. and North Korea made the Leap Day agreement, which was a promise not to conduct long-range missile launches or further nuclear tests in exchange for food aid. Yet a few months after that agreement was made, North Korea launched another satellite. The test was a failure, but a lot of observers were really puzzled by it, because on the one hand North Korea had just made an agreement, and very soon after, they were conducting activity that really undermined the agreement. I wonder if that's a precedent for what may potentially occur in this situation with the agreement with South Korea.What do you think is Pyongyang's strategy here?It's hard to say. What happened in 2012 surprised a lot of people.However, North Korea has a surprisingly multipolar system, and sometimes that can be the root of what appears to be hypocritical diplomatic strategies. A lot of people think of North Korea as this pyramid structure where power comes from the top and that's it -- a monolithic system. But the reality is that within North Korea there are various stakeholders, and those stakeholders do oftentimes act very independently of each other.It's also possible that this is all media posturing and that we're not going to see a satellite launch in October. And in fact, that's what the satellite imagery of the launch base suggests right now.There have been several threats from North Korean diplomats of almost imminent nuclear tests in the past year or so which never occurred.  It can be a way of ratcheting up tension to try and barter some sort of positive diplomatic outcome from the international community, especially South Korea and the U.S. North Korea said it’s not looking for an Iran-style deal. Do you think the Iran deal has affected their calculus in any way?Only to the extent that they are really trying to emphasize that they're not interested in any deal like that. North Korea has said consistently since Kim Jong Un became leader that nuclear weapons are an essential part of the country's future trajectory, in sync with economic development.  With that coming from the top, it wouldn't make sense to try and replicate the Iran deal any time soon.They also don't appear to be in need of any kind of relationship with the U.S. right now. Back in the day of [late North Korean leader] Kim Jong Il, there was a lot more diplomatic activity between North Korea and the U.S. and that came after North Korea's great famine in the mid-1990s. By many measures, North Korea is a lot better economically [now] than it was then. You’ve previously described North Korea’s ongoing cycles of escalation and de-escalation as Groundhog Day. What needs to happen to break the cycle?I was just re-reading that piece, which I wrote in 2012, and it really shocks me. Nearly everything I wrote there seems to have happened, just a few months later than I had thought. The fact that it was that predictable says a lot about the broken nature of diplomacy surrounding North Korea.We have seen that the way that world leaders are currently responding to North Korea leads to Groundhog Day: complaints to the U.N., limited sanctions on North Korea, complaints from Pyongyang that it has been unfairly singled out, followed by further tensions and a new nuclear test, and then we're back where we started.Understandably, democratically elected leaders need to be seen to be responding to things, but having seen the cycle repeat itself so many times, it seems that there does need to be some fresh thinking. And there are only really two options on the table: one is military -- and there doesn't seem to be much appetite for that -- and the other is of a different diplomatic response.  If you want to reduce the threat that North Korea's weapons pose, the best solution is some kind of settlement and diplomatic agreement. Unfortunately, everything seems very far away in that regard right now. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

7,THE WORLDPOST,Why North Korea's Latest Nuclear Threats Are Like Groundhog Day All Over Again,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-nuclear-weapons_us_55facf48e4b0fde8b0cd2596,"An expert explains why we've been here before, and how to break the cycle.",2015-09-19,"North Korea launched a satellite carried on a long-range rocket in Dec. 2012, causing international condemnation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fb39cb1c000024000826df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Chad O’Carroll, founder of NK News, an independent news and analysis site on North Korea.North Korean officials sent a defiant message to the world over their nuclear and missile programs this week, as the reclusive regime gears up to celebrate the ruling party’s 70th anniversary.The head of Pyongyang’s space agency said on Monday it was preparing to send a new earth observation satellite into space on a long-range rocket. The U.S. has warned this would violate United Nations resolutions against Pyongyang conducting ballistic missile tests, because of the similarity of the technology involved. Meanwhile, analysts and South Korean officials are skeptical of the announcement, saying there is little sign that Pyongyang is readying a satellite launch.A day later, the director of North Korea’s Atomic Energy Institute announced that the country’s main Nyongbyon nuclear complex was fully operational again and reiterated threats to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. The complex was closed in 2007 during six-party talks with the U.S., China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. But the talks collapsed, and North Korea said in 2013 that it would resume nuclear enrichment. Tuesday’s announcement accords with recent analysis by 38 North, a project of the U.S.-Korea Institute at John Hopkins University, which concluded, based on satellite imagery, that North Korea is “expanding its capacity to mine and mill natural uranium.” The WorldPost spoke to Chad O’Carroll, the founder of specialist news and media service NK News, about what’s behind the latest warning signs from Pyongyang. Did North Korea’s announcements this week about the rocket launches and nuclear reactivation come out of the blue?The statement about the satellite launch did not come out of the blue. North Korea has made at least two or three announcements this year about upcoming satellite launches, leading many analysts to suggest that there will likely be a satellite launch to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the ruling party. This has been a narrative building up to those events.The nuclear announcement did not necessarily come out of the blue either. Pyongyang had already announced that they would reactivate the nuclear processing plant, and that’s been underway for a while. This week’s statement was potentially triggered by 38 North recently publishing satellite imagery that shows activity at the Nyongbyon nuclear complex. The North Korean media may be responding to that, amid the general build-up to the Oct. 10 anniversary.What do we know about the current state of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, and how concerned should the world be about them?The technology for long-range ballistic missiles has not been fully mastered yet. It takes North Korea several weeks, if not months, to set up a satellite launch. So this is not much of a military threat because that's a long window of time for the U.S. to take that threat out.The real threat is two-fold: usage of short-range to medium-range ballistic missiles -- which North Korea has a lot of and have been proven to work -- and low-end applications of nuclear technology.  The problem is that as long as the status quo continues, the better North Korea's technology becomes. Five or six years ago, no one would have thought that in 2015 North Korea would be showcasing submarine technology to launch ballistic missiles.The announcement that they are restarting the nuclear facility is concerning. When plutonium reprocessing was previously frozen there were estimates that North Korea had enough weaponized plutonium for somewhere between five and 12 nuclear devices (depending on the size). It's also possible that there are other uranium enrichment facilities which would be harder to detect with satellite imagery, so the announcement about Nyongbyon could just be a red herring.It’s only been a few weeks since hostilities rapidly escalated with Seoul, before ending in an agreement to ease tensions. How does this square with Pyongyang’s announcements this week?That's the thing that is puzzling -- all of this is comes really soon after an agreement with South Korea to ease tensions.It may signal a repeat of the events of 2012. Early that year, the U.S. and North Korea made the Leap Day agreement, which was a promise not to conduct long-range missile launches or further nuclear tests in exchange for food aid. Yet a few months after that agreement was made, North Korea launched another satellite. The test was a failure, but a lot of observers were really puzzled by it, because on the one hand North Korea had just made an agreement, and very soon after, they were conducting activity that really undermined the agreement. I wonder if that's a precedent for what may potentially occur in this situation with the agreement with South Korea.What do you think is Pyongyang's strategy here?It's hard to say. What happened in 2012 surprised a lot of people.However, North Korea has a surprisingly multipolar system, and sometimes that can be the root of what appears to be hypocritical diplomatic strategies. A lot of people think of North Korea as this pyramid structure where power comes from the top and that's it -- a monolithic system. But the reality is that within North Korea there are various stakeholders, and those stakeholders do oftentimes act very independently of each other.It's also possible that this is all media posturing and that we're not going to see a satellite launch in October. And in fact, that's what the satellite imagery of the launch base suggests right now.There have been several threats from North Korean diplomats of almost imminent nuclear tests in the past year or so which never occurred.  It can be a way of ratcheting up tension to try and barter some sort of positive diplomatic outcome from the international community, especially South Korea and the U.S. North Korea said it’s not looking for an Iran-style deal. Do you think the Iran deal has affected their calculus in any way?Only to the extent that they are really trying to emphasize that they're not interested in any deal like that. North Korea has said consistently since Kim Jong Un became leader that nuclear weapons are an essential part of the country's future trajectory, in sync with economic development.  With that coming from the top, it wouldn't make sense to try and replicate the Iran deal any time soon.They also don't appear to be in need of any kind of relationship with the U.S. right now. Back in the day of [late North Korean leader] Kim Jong Il, there was a lot more diplomatic activity between North Korea and the U.S. and that came after North Korea's great famine in the mid-1990s. By many measures, North Korea is a lot better economically [now] than it was then. You’ve previously described North Korea’s ongoing cycles of escalation and de-escalation as Groundhog Day. What needs to happen to break the cycle?I was just re-reading that piece, which I wrote in 2012, and it really shocks me. Nearly everything I wrote there seems to have happened, just a few months later than I had thought. The fact that it was that predictable says a lot about the broken nature of diplomacy surrounding North Korea.We have seen that the way that world leaders are currently responding to North Korea leads to Groundhog Day: complaints to the U.N., limited sanctions on North Korea, complaints from Pyongyang that it has been unfairly singled out, followed by further tensions and a new nuclear test, and then we're back where we started.Understandably, democratically elected leaders need to be seen to be responding to things, but having seen the cycle repeat itself so many times, it seems that there does need to be some fresh thinking. And there are only really two options on the table: one is military -- and there doesn't seem to be much appetite for that -- and the other is of a different diplomatic response.  If you want to reduce the threat that North Korea's weapons pose, the best solution is some kind of settlement and diplomatic agreement. Unfortunately, everything seems very far away in that regard right now. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

11,HEALTHY LIVING,4 Scientifically Proven Ways To Have A Happier Morning,"Jennifer Rollin, ContributorMental Health Therapist, Body Image Activist, Wellness Enthusiast",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-scientifically-proven-ways-to-have-a-happier-morning_b_8127358.html,"Like any habit, this one may take some time to stick. To start, try setting your alarm for 30 minutes earlier than you would usually wake up. It is also important that you go to bed earlier, as sleep deprivation will only serve to decrease your productivity and overall happiness.",2015-09-19,2015-09-13-1442163908-1999789-happiness824419_640.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-13-1442163908-1999789-happiness824419_640-thumb.jpg,"In the past, I would have never described myself as a ""morning person."" In fact, I used to hate mornings. I would often begin the day by hitting the snooze button on my cell phone alarm. When I would finally wake up, it was usually a race to get out the door. I would rush to shower, do my hair and makeup, and quickly gather my things for the day. I never made the time to eat breakfast and frequently left the house feeling irritable. About a year ago, I decided to make some lifestyle changes. Now I have a morning routine that fills me with happiness. In fact, the early morning is one of my favorite parts of the day. The morning is when you set your intention and mindset for the day ahead. Therefore, it is important to look at how you can optimize this time. The following are five scientifically proven ways that you can bring more joy into your morning routine.1. Wake up earlier.Making the decision to wake up earlier has significantly improved my morning routine. When I wake up early I have more time, and subsequently feel less rushed. In addition, there is something peaceful about being awake before most people are up. Further, research shows that there may be a correlation between waking up earlier and increased happiness. One study conducted by The University of Toronto, found that ""people who wake up early in the morning are generally happier and have higher satisfaction overall in their lives."" Like any habit, this one may take some time to stick. To start, try setting your alarm for 30 minutes earlier than you would usually wake up. It is also important that you go to bed earlier, as sleep deprivation will only serve to decrease your productivity and overall happiness.2. Eat a nourishing breakfast.We've all heard the popular saying that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. So why is it that so many people choose to skip it each morning? By the time that you wake up, your muscles are in desperate need of more glycogen, for energy. In addition, ""the longer that you go without eating, the more glycogen your muscles use, and the less energy you have. Eating breakfast is also important in regards to boosting your mood.  Joan Sage Blake, a registered dietitian, exemplified this point when she stated, Research suggests that eating breakfast, specifically carbohydrate-rich cereals, can improve your mood. Eating in the morning after a night's slumber will provide glucose to your starved brain. Most people are also likely to be happier and less grouchy when they aren't distracted by hunger pangs. When you are choosing what to eat for breakfast, try to pick something that is nourishing to both your mind and body. Rather than eating in a hurried manner, make an effort to savor and enjoy your food. This could help to improve your experience of eating and may add more happiness to your day.3. Find joyful movement.It's common knowledge that exercise can have mood-boosting effects. According to Michael Otto, a psychology professor, ""The link between exercise and mood is pretty strong. Usually within five minutes after moderate exercise you get a mood-enhancement effect."" The problem is that many people view exercise as a ""chore"" or as a form of punishment. Instead, try to find a way to move your body that you truly enjoy. Personally, I love taking walks while listening to inspirational podcasts, and watching the sunrise. Exercise should be fun and if you don't like what you are currently doing, find another form of movement. Ideas for joyful movement could include taking a walk outside, doing gentle yoga, or going for a jog. You should aim to do whatever truly nourishes your body and mind, and if it incorporates nature and mindfulness-that is an added bonus. 4. Do one activity mindfully.A study conducted by Harvard researcher, Matt Killingsworth, found that ""people who focused on their present moment experience, were significantly happier than people whose minds wandered away from the moment."" However, incorporating mindfulness into your morning routine does not mean that you must begin an intensive meditation practice. Something that I have found to be personally helpful is to do one activity mindfully. Whether it's being mindful when you are taking a shower, eating breakfast, or drinking coffee, there are so many opportunities to practice this skill. Gillian Galen, a psychologist, provided an example of this when she stated, When you have breakfast tomorrow, simply sit and eat your breakfast. Don't read the paper, scan at your e-mail, or read the cereal box. Notice your experience. Notice when you become distracted by urges to do other things, and bring yourself back to the full experience of eating breakfast (experiencing the tasks, smells, temperature, and so on). Our culture emphasizes multi-tasking, and for many of us it may be rare to fully be in the present moment. Doing one activity mindfully could boost your happiness and improve your mindset for the day ahead.By adopting these habits you can bring more joy into your morning routine and may subsequently have a happier day. We have been given this one life and each day that we wake up, is another gift. It's up to us to make the best of it. Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple Inc, summed it up best when he said,""For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."""

But as evidenced in Wednesday's Republican presidential debate, while a few of the candidates depart from the party's most heated foreign policy rhetoric, none of them have come up with a coherent alternative. The frontrunner, Donald Trump, was, as usual, bombastic and fact-free. His main point on foreign policy seems to be that negotiating a real estate lease or running a reality TV show qualifies him to go toe-to-toe with Vladimir Putin or Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This is standard fare for Trump, underscored by his recent appearance at the much ballyhooed but sparsely attended rally against the Iran nuclear deal organized by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). On that occasion, Trump declared ""we will have so much winning if I get elected, that you may get bored of winning."" Or, as he suggested in the debate, ""We'll have more of everything,"" from savvy trade deals to increased military might. It's foreign policy by force of personality - and a volatile, ill-informed personality at that. Rand Paul made the most telling criticism of Trump in response to a question about whether the real estate developer turned entertainer had the temperament to be trusted with ""his finger on the nuclear codes."" After Trump himself dodged the question in favor of an ad hominem attack on Paul, the Kentucky senator questioned whether someone with his ""sophomoric quality"" and ""careless language"" could indeed be trusted to negotiate with Iran, or have control of the aforementioned nuclear codes. Trump's response? A backhanded jab at Rand Paul's looks!   All that being said, Trump managed to get one thing right when he spoke about the disastrous consequences of the George W. Bush administration's invasion of Iraq. Rand Paul chimed in, noting that ""The Iraq war backfired . . . We're still paying the repercussions of a bad decision."" Jeb Bush drew applause from the conservative crowd when he fired back that his brother had kept America safe. But Bush's assertion is dead wrong with respect to Iraq. The Iraq war made America less safe and less prosperous. It opened the door to the rise ISIS, whose predecessor organization, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), was formed in response to the U.S. intervention. And the war's total cost - which we will be paying for years to come - could exceed $4 trillion, according to an analysis by Linda Bilmes of the Kennedy School. Trump and Paul deserve credit for bucking the prevailing GOP narrative about the ""success"" of the Iraq intervention.  The CNN debate revealed two camps on the issue of the nuclear deal with Iran - those who opposed the deal and promised to rip it up on day one of their presidency, and those who opposed it but acknowledged that it wouldn't be so simple to walk it back given commitments to allies. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee win the prize for the most inflammatory rhetoric on the subject. Cruz called the Iran deal a ""catastrophe"" and identified the possibility of an Iranian nuclear weapon as ""the greatest security threat to the United States."" Huckabee went further, stating that it was ""really about the survival of Western civilization."" Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich came out in the middle, opposing the deal but acknowledging the need to consult allies and noting, as Bush did, that ""it's not a strategy to tear up an agreement."" Rand Paul struck the most reasonable note, with his novel suggestion that we actually wait and see whether the deal is working: ""Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That's absurd. Wouldn't you want to know if they complied?""  Paul's position was a refreshing departure from GOP orthodoxy, which has come to treat the Iran deal as the foreign policy equivalent of Obamacare - a partisan rallying point, with little or nothing to do with the details of the policy. And the results on the Iran deal may be the same as with Obamacare - lots of huffing and puffing but little real political traction. When Americans are given basic information about the Iran agreement, a majority support it. So screaming about the Iran deal may be a satisfying Republican talking point, but it is both bad policy and bad politics. The biggest news to come out of the CNN debate was the performance of Carly Fiorina. Many pundits cited her as the winner of the debate, hands down, in part due to her alleged ""policy chops."" And while Fiorina does deserve some credit for giving a few details of what she would spend the Pentagon budget on, her proposals don't add up. She called for a military that includes 50 Army brigades, 36 Marine Corps battalions, and between 300 and 350 ships. What she failed to point out was that her numbers seemed to come straight from page one of a recent report by the Heritage Foundation. And as Kate Brannen has pointed out in an excellent piece in the Daily Beast, Fiorina's wish list would cost an extra $500 billion or more over the next decade, with no proposal as to how to pay for it. There was also no indication of what missions Fiorina would expect these extra forces to actually carry out.   Far from offering fresh insights on complex national security issues, Fiorina offered a policy of tough talk devoid of any indication of how she would make the tough decisions necessary to craft a coherent and sustainable national security policy. Her style may be different, but in substance her approach isn't that far from Donald Trump's assertion that ""we'll have more of everything!"" It remains to be seen whether this hawkish posturing will play with independent voters, or even with those parts of the Republican base that care about fiscal responsibility and are wary of military intervention in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan. But other than Rand Paul's note of caution about getting involved in additional military interventions, there has not been much to distinguish the members of the Republican field when it comes to defense policy.Even John Kasich, who helped kill the B-2 bomber when he was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and has the experience needed to take on chronic waste at the Pentagon, has been swept up in the politics of more. Kasich's has proposed a dramatic increase in the size of the U.S. Navy beyond what is projected in the Navy's current shipbuilding plan, a plan which is itself unaffordable relative to the resources likely to be available over the next three decades. The Ohio governor should reconsider this ill-conceived proposal. In fact, Kasich should distinguish himself by taking a stand against building a dozen new ballistic missile submarines at a cost of $7 to $8 billion per ship, or by announcing specific plans to hold contractors accountable for the cost overruns and outright fraud that too often occur in the process of developing new weapons systems. Then at least one of the Republican candidates might begin to craft a defense policy that involves more than talking tough and throwing more money at the Pentagon, regardless of what is actually needed to defend the country."

Copy space.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb32bcf240000500097467f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's sad to think how many people go their whole lives dreaming of goals that they will never hit. While many of us have aspirations we want to reach, few of us actually get to the final destination.The main reason behind this is consistency. We lack the ability to stick through the changes we need to make to turn our visions into reality. This in part can be blamed on the way media portrays the successful. It's a common belief that some giant act of heroism is what catalyzes success to begin. In reality, this path to reach success is rare. For all the people who got lucky and hit a homerun his or her first time at bat, there are a million others who struck out and gave up.Thus the true way to hit our goals is by working on them every damn day. Below, I'll go through 3 proven methods that will get you to your goals. This isn't some get rich quick scheme, or the type of advice you get from infomercials selling you the latest ""Ab maker 3000."" These are time-consuming and tedious habits that will get you to your goals the old fashioned way: through consistent and determined effort over a long period of time.1. Focus on one habit to change and be consistentThe number one reason why people fail to hit their goals is because they don't keep up the routine they originally start. For instance, say you want to lose weight. Instead of going cold turkey, what if you just cut the ice cream sandwich at night. Lets say it's only 300 calories. You don't change anything but you just change that one tiny thing. By the end of a year, you just saved over 100,000 calories off your body.This is a simple example, but it highlights how core consistency is to reaching your goals. Don't try and do a complete magical transformation overnight. Instead, focus on one thing, and execute it everyday for about 2 months. The change will lead to more and more habit changes, and soon you'll be well on your way to hitting your goal.2. Track everythingFrom now on, write down everything throughout the day that you're doing in regards to the goals you set for yourself. If you want to get healthy, write down everything your eating everyday. Lets say you're a business owner. Write down everything that you did to move your business forward.By the end of the day, the results will surprise you. You'll be able to look at what you did for the business and realize that many of your activities were unnecessary. Tracking what we do has such a profound effect on us because it forces us to measure our progress through tangible metrics. We also are unable to forget the 2 hours of TV we watched or the 3-layer cheesecake we scarfed down. The key to getting to our goals is tracking what's holding us back, and removing those distractions.3. Write your goals down  Write down the 3 main things you want to accomplish. These should be major goals that you want to achieve. Until these goals are written down, they are just fantasies. Putting your goals on paper brings them to life. There are so many distractions in today's world, and we ignore 99% of them. But when we physically have our goals in front us everyday, we naturally start thinking about them much more. Force all your effort and time thinking about what you want to achieve, and you'll graviate in the right direction."

In a letter to believers on September 8, the Argentinian pontiff said annulments would require approval by only one church tribunal, rather than two as currently. A streamlined procedure is to be introduced for the most straightforward cases and access to hearings will not cost anything, the letter states. AFP PHOTO / FILIPPO MONTEFORTE (Photo credit should read FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9125e200000f90101e465.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the Pope takes center stage in the heart of the nation's capital next Thursday, Americans will be enthralled. This Pope has done more to take on the establishment he leads than any other Vatican leader in our lifetime. And he has done so with grace, energy, and determination. Our political leaders will all be there watching him. They should learn from him too.When I served in the heart of a Catholic village in Costa Rica as an environmental education Peace Corps Volunteer in the 1990's, I was new to the power of the Pope. At that time, Pope John Paul II was in the Vatican, and he set an example for the people I lived with and grew to love. They looked to him for guidance and were infused with energy from their Catholic faith.Every morning I would hear the chants of the priests over the radio reciting morning prayers. I saw how the spirit of the village was infused with energy from their Catholic faith. It reminded me of my Jewish upbringing and the vitality that being Jewish has given me. It created a sense of community and shared values in the village, values that were inclusive and inspiring.These values that guided my village friends were in many ways a product of the community's faith. They believed in supporting each other, in knowing their neighbors, in ensuring that everyone around them was cared for. They knew the earth around them as well, understanding how the mountains, streams, and wildlife both sustained and enriched their world.That experience, where community values generated by faith in something bigger than oneself ruled the day, is what is creating such a buzz about the new Pope Francis. He exudes a devotion to the community and the natural world around us, and does so in a manner that is attractive to all of us. I see in him much of what I saw in that Central American village - a true desire to make the world a better place.Which brings us back to the current crop of American politicians that the Pope will soon be addressing. The Pope strikingly stands for solutions that our Congressional leaders - and us by extension - would benefit from embracing.Think climate change. Think women's rights. Think economic equality. Think social tolerance. Think immigration. Think Iran and Middle East peace. The Pope understands that: ""Climate change is a global problem with grave implications..."" and that ""... there is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy.""Our Congress should recognize this and follow this lead. He has also loudly proclaimed that women's rights and equality must be demanded, such as when he calls for: ""... Equal compensation for equal work,"" proclaiming ""... Why is it expected that women must earn less than men? No! They have the same rights. The disparity is a pure scandal.""  And on economic equality, he is clear: ""Working for a just distribution of the fruits of the earth and human labor is not mere philanthropy. It is a moral obligation. For Christians, the responsibility is even greater: it is a commandment."" The same goes for his belief in social tolerance for the LGBT community. For example, he once said: ""A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: 'Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?' We must always consider the person. Here we enter into the mystery of the human being."" And on immigration he is clear: ""A change of attitude towards migrants and refugees is needed on the part of everyone, moving away from attitudes of defensiveness and fear, indifference and marginalization - all typical of a throwaway culture - towards attitudes based on a culture of encounter, the only culture capable of building a better, more just and fraternal world."" Likewise, on issues of war and peace, such as Iran and the Middle East, he has no reservations: ""May one cry rise up from every land, 'No' to war and violence and 'Yes' to dialogue and to peace. With war one always loses. The only way to win a war is never to wage it."" ""The Holy See values positively this (Iran nuclear) agreement because it considers that the way to resolve disputes and difficulties should always be that of dialogue and negotiation... The full implementation of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) will ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme under the NPT and will be a definitive step toward greater stability and security in the region."" On all of these issues, the Pope stands for progress. These are values that not only he, but also the majority of Americans, believe in. But will our own Congress show enthusiasm for these views? Will they stand and applaud the community values that the Pope represents and calls for, or will they sit on their hands? Their actions will represent all of us to the world, and I pray that they do the right thing. But I'm not holding my breath.My guess is that the majority of the audience members will behave as they currently do when these issues are brought up: they will oppose them. My Costa Rican village friends will likely be watching the speech, and I'm sure that they will be saddened at such a response. And if this is what happens, we should make our voices heard, and demand that Congress truly listen to what the Pope has to say. It will be a clarifying moment indeed."

Since the 1960s, however, we have learned that only a small percentage of chronic diseases (for heart disease perhaps 25%) are explained due to genetic origins. The majority of chronic illness are determined by our lifestyle choices. Whether we smoke, sit a lot, eat fried and processed foods, sleep poorly, and pack on the pounds may all trump even favorable genes to accelerate chronic diseases. In fact, the risk of heart attack is 85% lower in persons that take simple and inexpensive measures on a daily basis to preserve their health. Since the Framingham Heart Study was launched in 1948, risk factors for most chronic diseases that rob us of the quantity and quality of our years have been determined and have set the stage for public health campaigns. Health care providers assess for elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, elevated cholesterol, smoking, and a history of first degree relatives with early disease. Yet only about 50% of patients suffering a heart attack and stroke are identified by these measurements. Additional advances in the last decade have extended the search for risk markers including advanced lipid panels, inflammatory markers like high sensitivity C-reactive protein, measures of metabolism like homocysteine levels, and genetics parameters such as MTHFR and apolipoprotein E status. Although it is certain that the hunt for measurements for new markers inside our bodies predicting disease will continue, the hunt for understanding disease origins is now focused outside the body too. Scientific reports that air pollution is related to disease and death have appeared in the last few years. Certainly the importance of clean air has been recognized as an issue in terms smoking status and second hand smoking. Recent data has demonstrated that beyond smoking, air pollution is a major concern including reports that 1) cities with more air pollution have higher death rates than least polluted 2) air pollution is strongly related to heart disease events and 3) air pollution may damage arteries and cause inflammation. One of the more dramatic examples of the importance of air quality in initiating disease occurred during the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Factories were closed to limit air pollution before and during the sporting event. Heart disease rates fell and inflammatory markers dropped during the Olympics and climbed back to ""normal"" rates when the factories re-opened.This week another report on air pollution was published indicating that more than 3 million deaths a year can be attributed to dirty air. Pollutants from traffic, power generation and agriculture, largely animal husbandry, are the biggest contributors. Asian countries including India and China are suffering the worst problems. Projections were made that by 2050 the number of deaths linked to air pollution will double to over 6 million yearly. Science marches on. Our understanding of disease root causes has progressed from explaining illness due to aging, to blaming genes, and then to identifying lifestyle and biomarker relationships. Now the web of staying healthy is getting even more complex as the quality of air, and perhaps the quality of our water, the purity of our food, and our exposure to electromagnetic frequencies may have associations with health and disease. Being mindful of your environment would appear to be prudent. When possible, embracing nature and greenspaces with clean air is a prescription for the health of your mind and body."

It's called Muslims,"" the questioner said. ""You know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.""Trump interrupted the question, chuckling, and said, ""We need this question.

Sanders went on to tweet, ""this nonsense has got to end."" ""Let’s stop the racism.

And criticism didn't come only from the left. Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked registered Republican voters what they thought about the interaction, comparing it to a similar exchange in 2008 between then-presidential candidate John McCain and an audience member who called Obama an Arab. In that interaction, McCain took the microphone from the attendee saying ""he's not"" and calling him a ""good man."" While talking to voters, Kelly affirmed Obama's ""not a Muslim,"" calling the question ""objectively ugly."" The voters were fairly split, with some saying it was Trump's responsibility as a candidate to handle the question as McCain did, while others still questioned Obama's religious affiliation and said it wasn't Trump's job to clear the air.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), one of Trump's opponents, said in a Friday interview on NBC's ""Today"" show that Trump had ""an obligation"" to correct the questioner, and that he would have done so. ""If somebody said that at one of my town meetings, said something like that, I would correct them and say the president is a Christian and he was born in this country,"" said Christie.This post has been updated to include O'Malley's response.

""I look at our friends in the Latino community as people that ought to be voting Republican,"" the Ohio governor said at a campaign event, according to The Columbus Dispatch. ""I mean, they're very strong family. We could all learn a little from them about the importance of family, couldn't we? Because they are great, they are God-fearing, hard-working folks. And a lot of them do jobs that they're willing to do.""""That's why, in a hotel, you leave a little tip, you know?""He went on to talk about a hotel maid he met on a trip to Los Angeles, who wrote him a note saying, ""I really want you to know that I care about your stay,"" according to the Los Angeles Times. ""Is that just the greatest thing?"" he continued. ""So, you know, we can learn a lot and she's Hispanic, 'cause I didn't know it at the time, but I met her in the hallway -- asked her if I could get a little more soap.""Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said the candidate was referring more generally to the hospitality he'd received. ""He was talking about how great the service was and how we should respect everyone in our society, no matter what their job or position might be,"" Schrimpf said.Kasich's comment fits into a broader perception that Latino immigrants -- and particularly, undocumented people -- do jobs that others won't. Although the percentage of undocumented immigrants working in white-collar industries has increased, most of them work in low-wage jobs. Many agricultural workers are undocumented, for instance, which caused a major problem for Alabama farms in 2011 when people left the state after its harsh anti-unauthorized immigration law went into effect. Immigration advocates argue the willingness of undocumented people to take on jobs Americans won't is a reason for reform.But there's pushback to that narrative as well. Television host Kelly Osbourne caused a stir last month on ABC's ""The View"" when she said, ""If you kick every Latino out of this country, then who is going to be cleaning your toilet, Donald Trump?"" She was quickly rebuked by ""The View"" host Rosie Perez, and later apologized.Not all immigrants are Latino, and not all immigrants are undocumented. In fact, a majority of Latinos are U.S.-born, making them, along with naturalized immigrants, a large population of would-be voters. On immigration issues, which are not the top concern for most Latino voters but rank higher than for voters as a whole, Kasich actually has a softer stance than many of his fellow Republican contenders. He supports offering certain undocumented immigrants legal status, rather than driving them out or deporting them. And although he once supported ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, he now says he is opposed to changing that right.Cleveland's CBS affiliate aired video of part of Kasich's comments:  "

22,POLITICS,Freddie Gray Died From The Same Racial Injustice That Will Keep His Neighbors Off The Jury,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/freddie-gray-death-trial_us_55f9b38de4b0d6492d63f5cc,History cannot be ignored.,2015-09-18,Baltimore residents stand up for Freddie Gray on May 1.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fb30011c00002e00757505.jpeg?ops=crop_78_117_2894_1730%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In July 1991, a California appeals court unanimously agreed to move criminal proceedings against four police officers charged with assaulting Rodney King out of Los Angeles. The videotaped beating of the 25-year-old black motorist had already set off racial tensions nationwide.The defense argued that their clients could not get a fair trial in Los Angeles due to the extra-contentious pretrial publicity. So the trial was relocated -- to Simi Valley, a highly conservative and predominantly white city in nearby Ventura County. One Asian, one Hispanic and 10 white people sat on the jury that eventually acquitted the officers -- a decision that led to the infamous 1992 Los Angeles riots.Lawyers for the six Baltimore police officers charged in the April death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray recently attempted a similar maneuver. In May, they called for their clients' trials to be shifted outside the city, citing fears that national media coverage of Gray's death and the subsequent protests had tainted the jury pool.Last week, a judge ruled that the criminal trials will remain in the city for now and that the officers will be tried separately. There's still a chance that the trials could be moved if the judge concludes during juror selection that a unbiased jury can't be seated. But no matter where the trials take place, residents from West Baltimore -- where Gray lived -- aren't likely to sit on the jury.Pretrial publicity is a legitimate concern for defense attorneys. Some studies have shown that high-profile media coverage can make potential jurors more likely to believe a defendant is guilty. Jury pools can be tainted by prosecutors' prejudicial statements, revelations about criminal records, and media images that sensationalize the crime or the alleged perpetrator.If the defense can demonstrate that pretrial publicity has prejudiced the jury pool against the defendant, a judge can approve what's called a change-of-venue motion and move the trial out of the jurisdiction where the crime allegedly occurred.This seems unlikely for the Baltimore cops, said Doug Colbert, a law professor at the University of Maryland and a former public defender.""The media here has been both friendly and sympathetic to the police, and it's also described the community and Freddie Gray's family's pain and disbelief,"" Colbert said. ""You just don't have a situation here where the media has been trying to convict the officers before trial -- and that's not surprising. Police officers, generally, rarely face criminal charges, and they have enormous amounts of community support for the work they do.""Colbert said that in Maryland, the administrative judge of the jurisdiction where the crime is being prosecuted ultimately makes the call on whether a case needs to be moved and on where to move it. ""Unfortunately, there's very few guidelines, which surprised me,"" he said.Generally, Colbert explained, courts consider the convenience of witnesses, who must travel to another jurisdiction, and look for a place with similar demographics. ""This is usual, in the rare instance when a trial is moved, but this is not what is necessarily required here in Maryland,"" he said.With the officers accused in Gray's death set to be tried separately, the first trial will be critical, according to Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University and a former public defender.""If the judge cannot impanel a fair trial [jury], then I assume the defense will renew its change-of-venue motion and seek to move the case to a different location in Maryland,"" he said. ""That, I think, might create a precedent for moving the other five cases as well.""The cases have to be tried somewhere in Maryland since the officers have been charged with state crimes. But if not Baltimore, where might these racially charged trials go?Prince George's County is the only jurisdiction in Maryland with racial demographics that look like Baltimore City's, meaning it would be hard to ensure as diverse a jury pool anywhere else in the state. But majority-black Prince George's County has its own history of police violence. An in-depth investigation by The Washington Post revealed that police in the county shot 122 people between 1990 and 2001, killing 47. Most of those shot were black, and around 45 percent were unarmed.The other 24 counties in Maryland are predominantly white.""The general view is people in Baltimore may feel that this was a vicious crime, and so the defense generally wants to get the case out of there based on the idea that if people are further removed from the city, they might be more objective,"" said Medwed. ""That's the theory, but maybe the underlying goal is to find a jury that might be more sympathetic to the police.""White Americans are far more likely than black Americans to say police in most cities treat black people as fairly as they treat white people.Marc Zayon, an attorney representing Officer Edward Nero, expressed hope that Baltimore City could provide his client with ""a fair and impartial jury.""""If we can impanel a jury that judges Officer Nero only on the relevant facts of the case and not outside factors, he will be acquitted of all charges,"" Zayon told The Huffington Post. ""The facts of the case will show he has done absolutely nothing wrong.""Lawyers for the other five cops -- including Officer William Porter, whom prosecutors have said they intend to try first -- did not return requests for comment. It's not known whether any of them will end up opting for a jury trial. They could plead out beforehand or, as Colbert noted, request a judge trial, thereby excluding the direct voice of the community.If and when the jury selection process goes forward in Baltimore, observers will be keeping a close eye on racial demographics. Sixty-three percent of Baltimoreans are black and nearly 32 percent are white, according to the most recent census data. But according to Colbert, the eligible jury pool (see more on this below) is closer to 50-50. So a racially representative jury would most likely consist of six or seven black and five or six white jurors, he said.But Colbert suggested that the defense's strategy will be to assemble a less-diverse jury.""The defense would like a county and a jury that's primarily comprised of white jurors, and a county that is at least perceived to be pro-police and anti-Freddie Gray,"" he said. ""When you have a multiracial jury, then you're going to have a very different conversation.""Even if the racial identity of the jury is about evenly divided and even if the selection process takes place in Baltimore, however, the jurors chosen are not likely to have much in common with Freddie Gray.Out of 622,104 Baltimore residents, only about 300,000 are even eligible for jury duty. Besides those who are too young or too ill or don't understand English well enough, Maryland generally excludes people with prior felony convictions or those facing felony charges from jury pools. West Baltimore, which includes Freddie Gray's neighborhood of Sandtown-Winchester, is home to over half of all people released from Maryland's prison system each year. The violent crime rate there is 23 incidents per 1,000 residents -- almost double the city's rate as a whole and six times the national rate. More than half of the area's residents ages 16 to 64 out of work, and many people end up with minor drug convictions. Gray himself had a number of minor drug convictions, and he reportedly had previous run-ins with the cops who arrested him in April.West Baltimore was also the site of protests, both peaceful and violent, after his death. If those most directly affected by the protests are largely kept off the officers' juries -- which is a possibility -- Gray's community would have less of a voice in the trials.Medwed pointed out that for the defense, weighing the racial aspects could be complicated by the fact that three of the six officers are African-Americans. ""Since there's six different trials,"" he said, ""maybe each defense lawyer -- depending on … the race and role of their client in the incident -- they might have a slightly different view on where they move it to."" At times there can be a disconnect between officers of any race and black communities. Some studies have shown that black officers tend to be tougher on black people than white officers are. ""The hostility between the African-American community and the police really transcends the individual faces of the officers,"" Medwed said. ""It's more this idea that law enforcement is unfairly targeting the African-American community -- and that's where a lot of the upset comes from."" Beyond the issue of pretrial publicity, Colbert sees a problem with any implication that largely black Baltimore won't be able to produce an unbiased jury pool. He said black Baltimoreans are capable of rendering justice for -- and even acquitting -- the officers charged with Gray's death.""Overall, the black community has just a fine sense of justice, of understanding when officers act properly and when they do not -- much more so than the general white community, which instinctively … finds that the police did right or were justified in what they were doing,"" Colbert argued. Prospective jurors will first fill out questionnaires, and then the judge and likely the lawyers will converse with them. Some potential jurors will be eliminated ""for cause."" For instance, people who are friends or relatives of the victim or the defendants will be removed. People who are or have relatives in law enforcement may be eliminated, as well as anybody with friends or relatives who were killed by police.But the removal of potential jurors doesn't end there. Since attorneys can use a certain number of ""peremptory"" challenges to exclude people without giving a reason, jury selection can be biased by the lawyers' ""gut feelings"" on who might be more or less likely to side with their clients. Gut feelings have a long history of lining up with societal stereotypes and prejudices.""Of course you're looking for jurors who you believe will be more favorable to your side, but what's easier to do is to eliminate someone whom you believe has already decided the case,"" Colbert said. ""The truly credible juror,"" he said, ""is one who's struggling with the answer.""What happened before and after Gray's arrest is still unclear, especially the individual degrees of responsibility among the officers involved.The Baltimore Police Department admitted on April 24 that Gray had not received timely medical care after sustaining a severe spinal injury in custody. He died on April 19. Autopsy reports showed that Gray had a single ""high-energy"" injury, allegedly caused by a ""rough ride"" while he traveled in the back of a police van on April 12. Gray was shackled but not secured by a seatbelt, and the injury likely occurred when the van decelerated quickly. His death was ruled a homicide, based on the officers' alleged failure to follow safety procedures.In May, all six officers involved in the incident were charged and indicted. They face a range of charges. Most seriously, Caesar Goodson, the officer who drove the van, is charged with second-degree ""depraved-heart"" murder, as well as manslaughter, two counts of vehicular manslaughter and second-degree assault.Officer Porter, Sgt. Alicia White and Lt. Brian Rice are charged with involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault. Officers Nero and Garrett Miller also face charges of second-degree assault. In addition, all six are charged with misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. Each of the officers has pleaded not guilty.So far, this is all the public knows of what happened to this young man. Witnesses must be heard. Evidence must be explained. Context cannot be ignored.The events of April 12 did not happen in a vacuum. Freddie Gray and the six officers were all products of a society in which police routinely abuse black communities. A jury that doesn't know that, or refuses to believe it, is not fair or unbiased or capable of doing justice in this case.Perhaps the problem with moving Gray's trial elsewhere was best summed up in 1991 by a prosecutor named Roger Gunson. Upon hearing that Rodney King's case had been moved to Simi Valley, Gunson, then with the Los Angeles district attorney's office, immediately knew what the outcome would be.""I have never been so horrified in my life,"" he said."

Over the course of the next year, he initiated not only a change to the island's laws related to panhandling and free speech, but a major change in his own life.Guy contacted the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii which, along with Matthew Winter, an attorney for Honolulu law firm Davis Levin Livingston, filed a civil lawsuit against Hawaii County to protect constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights.The police officer who cited Guy said his panhandling was obstructing traffic and thus counted as ""aggressive solicitation,"" from which the county ordinance aimed to protect the public. But the ACLU argued that Guy's panhandling was no less aggressive than politicians armed with signs on the side of the road. “When a politician or police officer can wave a sign on the road asking for the public’s support, but a poor person faces criminal charges for the exact same conduct, that is wrong,"" Winter said in a statement.Guy declined an interview with HuffPost, but in a statement said, “The County of Hawaii should treat homeless people with dignity, and recognize that we have constitutional rights -- including the right to free speech -- just like everyone else.”The criminal charges against Guy were eventually dismissed, and on Monday, more than a year after police issued the citation, the ACLU announced a settlement in the case requiring Hawaii County to repeal multiple code provisions that criminalized solicitation and begging, as well as pay $80,000 in attorneys’ fees, costs and damages.In an email to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Molly Stebbins, corporation counsel for the County of Hawaii, said ""the law in this area is always evolving"" and that the amended provisions ""strike the proper balance between First Amendment protections and public safety concerns.”Winter told HuffPost that the outcome was both a victory for free speech and for Guy, who learned his voice matters.Winter said it took a lot for his client, a man ""on the fringe"" of society, to stand up for what he felt was right, but Guy ""was someone who saw that he could make a change.""Guy, Winter is happy to report, is no longer homeless, and moved back to Colorado earlier this year. He plans to enroll in community college there and pursue his love of music.Moreover, the settlement represents a win for Hawaii's homeless population -- the highest per capita in the nation, at 487 homeless per 100,000 Hawaii residents.""Why would people want to invest in society,"" Winter asked, ""when they are constantly pushed around?""On Wednesday, the ACLU filed another lawsuit on behalf of Hawaii's homeless, this time against the city of Honolulu. The class-action suit alleges that city officials deprived homeless people of food and other belongings during raids on encampments. The lawsuit seeks a court order to halt future sweeps and compensation for homeless families whose property has been destroyed. Also on HuffPost: "
