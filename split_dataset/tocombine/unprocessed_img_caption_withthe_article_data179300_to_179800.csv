0,DIVORCE,Taking Responsibility For My Part In Our Failed Marriage,"Debbi Dickinson, Contributor
Entrepreneur",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taking-responsibility-for_us_5b9c2cece4b03a1dcc7cdcb9,It's so easy to point a finger at your soon-to-be ex and make a list of all the things they did that contributed to the downfall of your marriage.,2012-08-27,"Beautiful blonde young woman, silk bathrobe, standing by the window, between the curtains, natural light",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2cec240000500094938d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's so easy to point a finger at your soon-to-be ex and make a list of all the things they did that contributed to the downfall of your marriage.There are three parts to every story story: his story, her story and the truth. The reality is that both parties contribute to a downfall of the marriage. One party just doesn't suddenly wake up one day and declare it's ""Divorce Day."" There are always events or emotions that lead up to a break-up. It's important to take a look at your part in the events leading up to the divorce decision. Don't look in your ex's backyard of issues; look in your own backyard. This is difficult because it's easier to put blame squarely on someone else's shoulders, rather than taking an honest look at ourselves.My marriage fell apart once I got sober. It was easy for me to point to my addiction and say, ""if you had to deal with what I had to deal with, you would drink too!"" But I was wrong. And in the beginning of my divorce process, it was easy for me just to sweep my own issues under the umbrella of addiction. It's true that for me, addiction and divorce were intertwined. But for me to just to blame my divorce on my coping mechanism was not right. Nor was it right to blame my behavior on my ex.You must take responsibility for your own actions for two reasons. The first is to get closure on your marriage and divorce. Not owning up to your part puts you in the victim role. Closure on your divorce and marriage is freedom. Do you know anyone who complains about the injustices done to them by their ex during their marriage despite being divorced over a year? They aren't very free are they?The second reason is baggage. If you don't take responsibility for your part of the split, then what makes you think it won't happen again? If you don't learn and grow from your experience, you will carry the same baggage into your next relationship. In my opinion, this is the number one reason second marriages tend to fail at higher rates than first marriages. People don't spend the time learning and growing; they are too busy pointing fingers.I came to understand that in my marriage, I didn't communicate well. I also didn't want to deal with tough decisions in my personal life. I would avoid making decisions. And if a decision was made on my behalf by my husband, I would revert to passive-aggressive behavior patterns that fanned the flames of our marital issues.So, what do you do once you've gotten to a point of understanding and accepting your part? What I did was apologize to my ex one day when he was dropping off our daughter after a visit. He was surprised to hear me apologize for specific behaviors, and never did I mention anything about his behavior. I can say that I truly regretted the way I behaved; it was wrong. What I wasn't expecting was that this brief conversation laid down a new foundation for our post-divorce life, centered around our daughter. Today, we have mutual respect for each other and a great love for our daughter.Now that is freedom!"

PrologueI was standing in a glass box on a street in Brooklyn, an area in which I had not a single friend -- three thousand miles from my doorstep in Los Angeles. Curbside, a giant, gleaming, black Mercedes sedan idled in which two strangers -- men whose names I did not know and who spoke a language I did not understand -- waited for me. My young son was a few blocks away, in their basement. He was with a woman who went by an alias, and demanded cash. I wracked my brains for the PIN number of an account I'd not used in a decade, hoping to coax more money from the ATM. This was a Zoom Moment, for sure; a moment that makes no sense unless the lens trained on my life is pulled back. Way back. In a Zoom Moment, pulling wide is the only way to answer my existential shout out: How the hell did I get here? The answer was simple: Pediculosis. Lice. Yet it's complicated. Dear Reader: Allow me to begin at the beginning. I am a single mom. This is the story of our lousy year."

The rate of severely late credit card payments dipped nationally in the first three months of the year, even as banks issued more cards to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit, according to an analysis by credit reporting agency TransUnion.

Although we might have enjoyed some fun family vacations with the kids during the summer, the whole family is ready to get back into a ""normal"" routine again.The back-to-school season can teach us a few things about our improving our credit scores, too. Here are three lessons we can learn:1. Routine is good. During the summer, there's nothing wrong with a little fun and sleeping in. But we all know that we can't do it all the time. We need some structure and routine in our lives, so we're glad to get back to the normal routine of the school year at the end of summer. It's the same with your credit. We can't live a healthy balanced life if we just do whatever we want and don't pay attention to our credit. A little routine helps there, too: Schedule time to review your credit reports at least twice a year (quarterly is better), and schedule time to look at your finances and budget with an eye on maintaining healthy credit.2. Find the balance. You send your kids to school and you expect them to come home with a reasonable amount of homework. Too much homework or too little homework is cause for concern. Somewhere in between -- ""just the right amount of homework"" -- is where you want them to be. The same with how you handle your debt and credit: Having no debt is bad for your credit and having too much debt is bad for your credit score. Somewhere in the middle is just the right amount.3. Keep the big picture in mind. We send the kids back to school because they're driving us nuts. But that, of course, is not the ONLY reason we send them back to school. They go back to school because we want them to get a good education. The kids might be excited at first (and yeah, we all know it will probably wear off by the second week) but we keep sending them back because we know that the short-term ""pain"" will translate into more opportunities in the future. Similarly with our credit, we may not feel motivated to pay attention to our credit if there was no benefit to us. But there ARE two substantial benefits to knowing and improving your credit score: First, you get access to more money when you need it. Second, you pay lower interest for that money when you borrow it. This translates into real, tangible stuff: A nicer house for less, a nicer car for less, etc.Now that the kids have gone back to school, you can turn your attention to your credit. Visit MyFICO.com and order your credit scores. Set aside time to look at them. Get into a routine, find the balance, and keep the big picture in mind!"
3,FOOD & DRINK,Sweet Potato Zucchini Pancakes,"Stephanie Wise, Contributor

The plant is used in homeopathy as remedy ... ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2f6e2100003100c5065d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I don't know about you, but I hate to waste food. Sometimes I re-purpose extra ingredients for meals later in the week; sometimes I make my husband eat more of a dish just so we don't have to throw out the leftovers (he doesn't seem to mind this mild abuse); and sometimes, you may or may not find me gnawing on a carrot straight out of the fridge, just to put it to good use (this might also happen with a slice of cake or a plate of cookies. It's a sacrifice, but someone's got to do it). When it comes to leftover summer produce, I'm even more anxious to use it up before it goes bad. So when we had zucchini coming out of our ears and an extra sweet potato the size of Manhattan lying around the other day, I knew what I had to do: Make pancakes.Maybe it's the German in me, but I can hardly resist the allure of the potato pancake. Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, topped with a spoonful of applesauce or sour cream, there's nothing more comforting and satisfying than digging into a pile of piping-hot potato pancakes any time of year. Though I love my basic recipe, I'm also prone to wander into new territory. Yukon gold potato pancakes with chopped scallions and bacon. Fine-grated Russet potato pancakes topped with roasted apples and crème fraiche. Or, in this case, sweet potato pancakes mixed with grated zucchini and dolloped with paprika-spiked sour cream.What I love about this recipe -- and most pancake recipes in general, for that matter -- is that you really can't go wrong with the method: It's up to your palate's preferences more than anything else (thick or thin batter, shredded or grated potato, all-purpose or whole wheat flour, etc.). The biggest trick is to squeeze out most of the moisture in the zucchini before tossing it into the batter, but even if you forget, the pancake will still turn out to be a pancake. These are best cooked up on a cast-iron skillet or griddle top, too, for extra crispy edges. And there's no such thing as too much sour cream on top. I mean, someone's got to eat it all before it goes to waste.Sweet Potato Zucchini PancakesYields: 2 generous servings, 4 smaller servingsIngredients:2 cups shredded zucchini (about 2-3 medium zucchini) 2 cups peeled and shredded sweet potato (about 1 large potato) 4 eggs 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground pepper ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Paprika and sour cream, to tasteDirections:Place shredded zucchini in a colander and carefully squeeze out excess moisture through the holes. Place zucchini in a large bowl and add sweet potato, eggs, salt, pepper and flour. Stir to combine.Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in skillet; swirl to coat.Ladle just under 1/4-cupfuls of batter into the hot skillet, about 2-3 pancakes at a time. Cook until bottoms are deep brown and bubbles begin to form on top, about 3-5 minutes; flip and cook a few minutes more. Remove pancakes from skillet and place on a covered plate while you cook the remaining pancakes. Add more butter to the skillet as necessary. In a small bowl, stir together paprika and sour cream until you reach desired taste. Serve pancakes warm with sour cream on top."

The nearly bankrupt U.S. Postal Service on Thursday reported losses of $57 million per day in the last quarter and warned it will miss another payment due to the U.S. Treasury, just one week after its first-ever default on a payment for future retiree health benefits. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c30e92100005100c506d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SmartMoney:1. Your failure to send your Mother a proper birthday card is the least of our problems.For four days at the end of June, retired letter carrier Jamie Partridge and nine other current and former postal workers didn't eat. They were on a hunger strike to protest what the group saw as the biggest threat to the U.S. Postal Service's continued existence: Not e-mail's steady encroachment on snail mail's territory, not a prolonged economic downturn or the growing popularity of corporate shipping services, but government-mandated payments to pre-fund health care benefits for postal retirees -- 75 years into the future. ""To call out that Congress was starving the postal service, we were starving ourselves,"" Partridge says. Private-sector companies -- and even most other branches of the federal government, like, say, the Army -- aren't required to fund their health benefits so far in advance. It's an albatross of a financial burden on the Postal Service, hidden beneath the more striking headlines about shrinking mail volume -- down more than 21 percent since its 2006 peak -- and plummeting revenue. Indeed, in the first three quarters of 2012, the Postal Service lost $11.6 billion, more than twice what it lost during the same period in 2011.Publicly, the Postal Service has blamed its financial woes on a waning interest in old-fashioned mail (exacerbated by the financial crisis). And it has cited that reason when it announced staff reductions -- about a quarter of its workforce, or 150,000 postal jobs, will be eliminated by 2016 -- as well as when it talked about closing post offices and when it proposed ending Saturday mail delivery, a measure currently pending in Congress. But some in the postal industry say that declining mail is just an excuse: ""There is red ink -- but the overwhelming share has nothing to do with mail volume, the Internet, or other factors related to the mail,"" says Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers. The retiree health payments account for nearly 80 percent, or $9.2 billion, of the first three quarters' losses, and they ""not only have exhausted the Postal Service's profits, savings and borrowing authority, they also have distracted the USPS from addressing the structural issues that do indeed exist as society changes,"" says Rolando, adding that there are ""plenty of opportunities"" in mail, including e-commerce shipping. ""The prefunding of retiree health benefits for future retirees is a major cause of our financial crisis -- but not the only cause,"" says a USPS spokesman, citing decline in first-class mail as another major cause.RELATED: 10 Things Apple Won't Tell YouWhile many industry groups, including the Postal Regulatory Commission, have recommended that the health care payments -- the result of a congressional mandate passed in 2006, before the Postal Service's problems started -- be reduced to alleviate the burden, there is one massive roadblock: the federal budget. Because the retiree health prefunding payments are counted in federal funds, they are tied into the nation's budget, which some experts say amounts to the USPS subsidizing government operations. ""So the Postal Service has been a kind of cash cow for the federal government for the last 40 years,"" says Postal Regulatory Commission chairman Ruth Goldway.2. Our retirees are just fine, thanks.On Aug. 1, for the first time since the 2006 mandate, the Postal Service did not pay its $5.5 billion annual retiree health benefits bill, and announced that it's likely to default on the next payment too, due Sept. 30. While the announcement raised red flags of concern for the welfare of retiring postal workers, experts, including postal employee unions, contend that the retirees will be fine -- or may even be better off -- if the USPS doesn't pay another cent into the fund for a long time. Indeed, Postal Service inspector general David Williams wrote a letter to the Senate earlier this year recommending just that -- eliminating the annual payments and letting the $44 billion fund grow with interest. Despite the Postal Service's debt, its retiree benefit coffers are beyond full. Its pension funds are more than 100% funded, compared with 42% for all federal pension funds and 80% for the average Fortune 1000 pension plan. That ""astonishingly high figure,"" according to Williams, amounts to a ""war chest"" of resources that will take care of older workers for decades to come.RELATED: 10 Things Marriage Counselors Won't Say""The irony,"" says the NALC's Rolando, is that ""today's postal retirees, and future retirees, are well protected,"" while the Postal Service's financial status is in jeopardy. If it continues to struggle financially, it will likely cut back on post office locations and hours as well as delivery service -- which some experts say could disadvantage retirees and other Americans who rely on the Postal Service for efficient correspondence.3. Anybody want to buy an ailing government agency?As a federal agency, the Postal Service is something of a platypus: It is bound by law to perform certain functions -- the old postman's motto goes, ""Neither snow or rain nor heat nor gloom of night will stay these couriers from their swift completion of their appointed rounds"" -- but it also has to report financial results like a business. Some economists say turning the postal service into a corporation with a board of directors and a fiduciary duty to shareholders would allow it to make sound financial decisions based on market conditions, rather than falling prey to political motivations and bureaucratic red tape. Under the current system, ""managers are hamstrung,"" says Richard Geddes, Cornell University professor of policy analysis and management and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research.RELATED: 10 Things Amazon Won't Tell YouBut closing unprofitable post offices and stopping delivery on low-volume days would undermine the original equality-minded mission of the Postal Service to keep the country connected through the mail and to enable efficient communication to the most remote corners of the nation. ""It would do things beneficial to the bottom line but not to the country,"" says Steve Hutkins, a New York University professor who advocates for the protection of the Postal Service through his site SaveThePostOffice.com. Even proponents of privatization admit that it would be difficult. ""Any change is like shifting the direction of a battleship,"" Geddes says. When the idea was first floated in the 1990s, ""the comment that I got was, Who would buy it?"" says PRC chairman Goldway. ""I don't think the market realities are there now.""A USPS spokesman says privatization isn't the answer, adding that it would be hard for even a private company to profit serving rural areas, and that the Postal Service has a business plan to become ""financially sound and continue universal service to all Americans.""4. We're hiring our competitors to do our jobs for us.The Postal Service increasingly relies on outside corporations for everything from sorting mail and transporting it by air and ground to advertising and I.T. consulting: Last year, the agency spent more than $12 billion on such contracts, according to Husch Blackwell, a law firm that represents Postal Service contractors. The USPS even hires some of its competitors to help it do its job, including the United Parcel Service and FedEx, which was the Postal Service's highest-paid supplier in 2011. ""The postal service essentially has privatized everything but the last mile of delivery,"" Goldway says. The number of mail delivery routes served by outsourced carriers increased 84 percent to nearly 10,000 between 1998 and 2012, according to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service. There is now a thriving industry of third-party companies contracting with the USPS, including large publicly traded corporations such as presorting mail firm Pitney Bowes.Postal worker unions generally oppose the practice of contracting, which dates back to the 18th century, saying that outsourcing Postal Service functions is less reliable and takes jobs away from postal employees who are already being laid off in droves. The National Association of Letter Carriers has referred to the practice as a ""cancer"" that must be stopped before it spreads. Still, contractors deliver mail on just 4.4% of routes, up from 2.3% in 1998, according to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service. The Postal Service, for its part, says it will continue to use contractors, as long as doing so is cost-effective and consistent with their contractual obligations.5. We're addicted to junk mail.Like Big Oil and Big Pharma, the Big Mailers -- including banks and catalog publishers as well as presort mail companies -- are a powerful force on Capitol Hill, and the Postal Service courts their business because the vast breadth of envelopes buoys mail volume. Through its workshare discounting program, the Postal Service offers reduced postage rates to companies with large stakes in the mail -- from mass mailers like AT&T and Bank of America to mail-handling specialists like Pitney Bowes -- that presort mail or deliver it part of the way.In theory, the benefits should be mutual: Working with outside service providers increases efficiency and saves money, as contractors are often cheaper to hire than unionized postal employees. But the postage discounts the Postal Service offers contractors occasionally exceed the amount it saves in the deal; last year, 35 of these workshare arrangements were under water, according to the Postal Regulatory Commission's annual compliance report. (A spokesman for the USPS says the wokshare arrangements comply with the law.)Some experts believe the pricing mismatch is partially a result of politics. Bulk junkmailers like ValPak lobby forcefully against moves that would increase their postage rates. The National Association of Pre-Sort Mailers acknowledges that its members do a lot of the same tasks as the Postal Service -- just better, providing a higher profit margin and faster service. ""When the Postal Service is doing it themselves, it doesn't perform as well as the mail that's already prepared,"" says the association's executive director Bob Galaher.To continue reading, click here."

(Photo by David Cannon/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2a7024000031005318d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's become a recent trend in the ski industry for resorts to build out golf courses in an effort to boost visitation during the non-ski months. Courses serve as drivers of vacation home sales. While skiers and snowboarders around the country expressed frustration this past season over the poor weather conditions, some were smiling from ear to ear. The happy few: golf course operators.While my golf game may be extremely lacking, I like to think I can still pick out a good course when I see one. Here's a list of 5 ski resort towns that require sticks as well as poles.Sun Valley, Idaho (Trail Creek Course): A Robert Trent Jones Jr. designed course, Forbes calls it ""one of the best resort courses in the country that most golfers have never heard of."" Forbes must not have realized we'd be mentioning the course in one of our blog posts, as clearly most golfers worldwide will now be familiar with it. While Trail Creek remains the go-to course, they have built on a beautiful 9-hole called ""White Clouds"" and another 18-holer on real grass (apparently a rarity).Banff, Alberta (Silver Tip):  Yup, I was just as ba(n)ffled as you to find out that Banff is home to some of the top courses in North America. Be sure to analyze the extreme elevation changes - you may need to pull out your 9-iron for a 200+ yard shot on some holes (I'm now officially contemplating a move to Banff for no other reason than to be able to experience that on a regular basis and take some strokes off of my 46 handicap).Lake Tahoe:  Too many courses and too little time to mention them all, but Tahoe presents its visitors with the rare opportunity to go nuts on the ski slopes for a few hours, change into some classy golf attire, and hit the links for a quick 18. That's just unfair - talk about taking the phrase ""killing two birds with one stone"" to a whole new level.Ludlow, Vermont:  Before I took a at Liftopia, I always associated Vermont with windy nature-y roads, maple syrup, and quaint little towns. After traveling to some of our resort partners, I now associate Vermont with the exact same three things...plus awesome golf courses (and ski resorts, of course)! There is fantastic golf to be played close-by to Stowe Mountain Resort, Jay Peak Resort, and Okemo Mountain Resort.Sierra Blanca, New Mexico: Home to Ski Apache, a wonderful resort known for its ideal environment for beginner skiers and riders, this region is so packed with quality courses that it has become the host city of the New Mexico Open (this year taking place at Santa Ana Golf Club).I have a request into Evan (our CEO) to allow me to travel to each of the courses above as I feel it is very important to personally validate the content that we distribute to all of you through these blog posts. Thanks in advance to all of you for agreeing with me on this one. In the meantime, if you think I left off any amazing ski/golf towns from my list above, please let me know in the comment section below...and I can add it to my travel request!"
