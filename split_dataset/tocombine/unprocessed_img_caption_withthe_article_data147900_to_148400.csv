1,QUEER VOICES,Immigration for Same-Sex Spouses in a Post-DOMA World,"Scott Titshaw, Contributor
Associate Professor, Mercer University School of Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-for-same-sex-spouses-in-a-post-doma-world_us_5bafb905e4b0ad769260cb06,"Without DOMA, the federal validity of same-sex marriages will depend on state law, but it is not always clear which state law applies after married couples cross state lines: What happens when a couple is married in Massachusetts but lives in Georgia?",2013-07-27,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 27: GW student Cam Tucker is silhouetted behind a rainbow flag in front of the Supreme Court where arguments are being heard in a case against the Defense of Marriage Act on March, 27, 2013 in Washington, DC.

Windsor struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) provision that had rendered same-sex marriages invisible for federal purposes, including immigration. Without DOMA, the federal validity of same-sex marriages will depend on state law, but it is not always clear which state law applies after married couples cross state lines: What happens when a couple is married in Massachusetts but lives in Georgia?President Obama has expressed a policy preference for continuing to recognize such marriages for federal purposes, saying, ""If you've been married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you're still married, and ... under federal law you should be able to obtain the benefits of any lawfully married couple."" But he admitted that taht may not be legally possible in all areas of federal law, and his administration is still analyzing that question in various contexts. Immigration may be the most urgent and compelling case for rapid recognition. It was always heart-wrenching to witness U.S. citizens forced to choose between their country and their families because DOMA prohibited immigration benefits to same-sex spouses and their stepchildren.Fortunately, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) quickly recognized the long-established practice that ""as a general matter, USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] looks to the law of the place where the marriage took place when determining whether it is valid for immigration purposes,"" and the Board of Immigration Appeals has shown that it will focus on the validity of a marriage where it was celebrated, even in cases where the couple lives in a state that doesn't recognize marriage equality. The first cases approved by USCIS were for couples married in New York and Iowa but residing in Florida and Colorado, respectively. Although there was a disclaimer about possible exceptions in the DHS' original announcement, the administration now seems to have decided in favor of a uniform place-of-celebration rule. It would be right to do so.At least in the area of immigration, a uniform place-of-celebration rule would rest on firm legal and policy ground. That rule would also comport with the expectations of both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who recently dodged an amendment to recognize same-sex partners under the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill, arguing that DOMA's judicial demise would eliminate immigration inequality for all married same-sex couples. Law and Policy Support a Uniform Place-of-Celebration RuleThe federalism refrains of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion and Chief Justice John Roberts' dissent in Windsor could be used to argue against recognition of federal rights to gay residents of a state like Texas who travel to California just to get married. But that would be a terrible idea, at odds with the goal of family unity, which is the bedrock of U.S. immigration law. There is some precedent for refusing to recognize marriages of close relatives and biracial couples for immigration purposes due to strong public policy objections by the state of domicile of the couple in question. Yet those exceptions generally were limited to residents of states that enforced criminal statutes prohibiting the couples' cohabitation or expressly prohibited evasion of state law. It is highly unlikely that criminal prohibitions of same-sex cohabitation or out-of-state marriage would be valid after Lawrence v. Texas.A better illustration of modern doctrine regarding the immigration validity of disputed marriages involves transgender spouses. Until Windsor struck down DOMA's federal rejection of same-sex marriages, transgender spouses were required to demonstrate that their unions qualified as valid different-sex marriages under state law. In this context the Bush-era Board of Immigration Appeals and the Obama-era USCIS focused solely on the place of marriage celebration, although some states of domicile do not recognize gender reassignment for marriage purposes. The USCIS generally presumes that these are valid heterosexual marriages, and it even allows fiancé(e) petitioners indicating a specific intent to marry in a jurisdiction where the marriage would not be valid ""the opportunity to submit ... an affidavit attesting that the intended marriage will take place in a jurisdiction where"" it will be valid for immigration purposes.Family unity, particularly among spouses and their minor children, has long been a lodestar of our legal immigration system, as well as the primary mode of legal immigration. It would undermine this traditional focus on family unity if a married couple's qualification to enter the United States and live together depended on the U.S. citizen's state of residence. While it is harmful to refuse to allow a married couple to file joint income tax returns because of the couple's state of residence, it would be downright cruel to refuse to allow a U.S. citizen to live with her foreign national spouse or her stepchild unless she moved from Texas to California. Such hyperfederalism would undermine the freedom of interstate movement and the concept of national citizenship embodied in the 14th Amendment for over 28,000 U.S. citizens living with same-sex foreign partners.A policy refusing to recognize same-sex marriages based on the law of a couple's state of residence would also dramatically restrict interstate and international commerce, even in cases where no U.S. citizen is involved. Entrepreneurs and employers would have to consider the marriage law of worksite locations as a primary factor in determining where to locate or base married lesbian and gay employees. Circling back to Windsor, it is helpful to note that the federalism concern expressed in Justice Kennedy's opinion was not its ultimate rationale. In the end, it was ""unnecessary to decide whether the federal intrusion on state power is a violation of the Constitution because it disrupts the federal balance,"" since DOMA presents discrimination of an unusual character and thereby ""violates basic due process and equal protection principles."" Justice Kennedy also echoed the refrains of equality, personhood and dignity in choice of intimate and familial relationships that featured prominently in his opinions in Lawrence and Romer v. Evans. These ideas certainly support a unified place-of-celebration rule for marriage validity. In fact, as Justice Antonin Scalia again points out, Windsor also supports a constitutional requirement of full marriage equality for same-sex couples. While the Supreme Court has not yet taken that step, it is clear that a policy discriminating against same-sex couples raises serious constitutional issues. This is significant because the court has held that ambiguities in an immigration statute should be interpreted so as to avoid serious doubt as to its constitutionality. A uniform place-of-celebration rule would avoid such doubts.Adams v. Howerton Is History TooThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion in Adams v. Howerton has been cited extensively over the last 30 years. Most recently, it was the basis for a New York Times editorial co-written by former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, arguing that the Obama administration should still refuse to recognize any same-sex marriage for immigration purposes after the Supreme Court's recent decision. Fortunately, Mr. Gonzales was wrong. Adams is no longer good law. In 1982 (before DOMA was enacted), Adams held that U.S. citizen Richard Adams' Colorado marriage to Australian Anthony Sullivan, even if valid under state law (which it was not!), would not qualify as a ""marriage"" for immigration purposes. Later, then-Ninth-Circuit-Judge Anthony Kennedy wrote an opinion upholding Sullivan's order of deportation because he did not have a qualifying U.S. citizen spouse.Adams was originally a three-legged stool, but now it has no leg left to stand on. In Adams, the Ninth Circuit held that Adams' marriage was not valid under federal immigration law for three reasons: (1) immigration statutes that existed at the time barring admission into the United States of any foreign ""sexual deviants,"" such as homosexuals, expressing a clear federal policy incompatible with same-sex marriage; (2) deference to administrative interpretation of the relevant statutes rejecting such marriages; and (3) the ""ordinary, contemporary, common meaning"" of ""marriage"" as an indication of congressional intent. The first rationale is no longer relevant after the repeal of the ""sexual deviant"" ground of inadmissibility in 1990. The second rationale cuts in favor of same-sex marriages once USCIS officials begin recognizing them. The third and final argument was always weak, since it focused only on dictionary definitions of ""marriage"" to determine the intent of Congress, ignoring congressional intent to rely on state family law as it traditionally has done. In addition, the widespread movement toward marriage equality in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries has altered the common meaning of ""marriage"" so that many dictionaries now include same-sex couples within its definition.After Anthony Sullivan's deportation, he and Richard Adams managed to reenter the United States and remain together until Adams died last December. When Justice Kennedy penned Windsor, it may have been six months too late for Anthony Sullivan, but it should lead to recognition of other gay and lesbian married immigrants, even if they live in Georgia or Texas.Scott Titshaw will be speaking on this topic at the upcoming Lavender Law conference of over 1,500 LGBT lawyers and law students.

The Fed is likely to reduce its monthly bond purchases later this year and stop them altogether by mid-2014, as long as the economic recovery unfolds as expected, Bernanke has said.""We must make our exit from the bond-buying programme quick,"" Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, one of the Fed's most fiscally conservative officials and a persistent critic of the latest round of bond buying, said in WirtschaftsWoche.""An end to these bond purchases came into sight at the latest Fed meeting,"" said Lacker, who is not among the Fed policymakers who will vote on monetary policy this year.Lacker pointed to relatively low inflation and said a faster-than-expected fall in the U.S. jobless rate was sufficient to start winding down the programme.""First of all we should end the monthly purchases of mortgage bonds as quickly as possible,"" Lacker said in the interview. It was not the central bank's role to give any sector preferential support, he said.Lacker said the United States had made hardly any progress in cutting its debt and had instead only come up with temporary solutions for several months at a time.He said he hoped the Fed's planned scaling back of bond purchases this year and rising interest rates would force the U.S. Congress to agree more quickly on reducing debt. ""We need a sustainable solution and the sooner the better,"" he said.Whoever takes the helm at the Fed when Bernanke's term as chairman ends in January 2014 must find a way to exit the bond-buying programme without shocking the markets, Lacker said.He said the quantitative easing programme had done little to boost the economy, and the U.S. economy would grow by 2 percent this year and by no more than 2.25 percent next year - lower than the 2.8 percent in 2013 and 3 percent in 2014 forecast by other Fed policymakers - as consumers remain cautious.Lacker said more needed to be done on drawing up rules to avoid future government bank rescues and said stress tests done in the United States were a step in the right direction."

UNDER THE DOME: The Vikings have long enjoyed a significant advantage under the noisy Metrodome's roof on the spongy artificial,2013-07-27,"EDEN PRAIRIE, MN - MAY 3: Travis Bond #76 and Jeff Baca #60 of the Minnesota Vikings line up to run a drill during a rookie minicamp on May 3, 2012 at Winter Park in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. (Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6fc65250000320039caac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings have reached a crossroad, coming off a remarkable season during which they improved by seven victories, made the playoffs and watched Adrian Peterson transition from ACL rehab patient to MVP award winner.Slip back a bit, and 2013 will likely be widely viewed as a disappointment. To pick up where their progress left off last year, though, the Vikings will need just as much to go right as in that surprising 2012 season. Similar to last year, when they were coming off a 3-13 mess, the Vikings have again set out amid skepticism from analysts and fans about whether they're built to stay on a title-contending track.By the end of 2013, they'll know whether last season was simply a fluke or a foundation for the future.""Super Bowl: I know that's the goal as a group,"" Peterson said at the end of minicamp. ""I feel like we've got the right pieces in place. Everyone has that vision in their mind.""Five things to know about the Vikings as camp begins:1. PONDERING THE FUTURE: Christian Ponder will be the starter when the Vikings open at Detroit on Sept. 8. But he has a lot to prove before his status is ensured for next year, let alone for the rematch against the Lions that wraps up the regular season on Dec. 29. This time, the Vikings have a better option as a backup in Matt Cassel. General manager Rick Spielman has often said he needs three years to evaluate quarterbacks, bringing the former first-round draft pick into a crucial window. Not only does Ponder have a stronger offensive line, his receivers have been upgraded over that span, too, despite the departure of the do-it-all Percy Harvin. Greg Jennings was signed from Green Bay to be the leader, Jerome Simpson was brought back on another low-risk one-year contract and Cordarrelle Patterson was selected with the third of three late first-round draft picks. Tight end Kyle Rudolph, the Pro Bowl MVP, will also be relied on even more as a down-field weapon. ""Christian, I'm excited. He's a great quarterback. He's going to shock people,"" Jennings said last month.2. ALL DAY CAN GO ALL YEAR: Peterson left no doubt about his determination, focus and seemingly superhuman skills by returning from reconstructive surgery on his left knee to rush for 2,097 yards, 9 short of the NFL record. If Ponder can improve, the Vikings offense should be more balanced, which would make cracking the 2,000-yard mark again even more challenging for Peterson. But he's one of the rare players for whom any feat seems possible.3. UNDER THE DOME: The Vikings have long enjoyed a significant advantage under the noisy Metrodome's roof on the spongy artificial turf, but this is their last year in the quirky, outdated stadium. They'll play two seasons outside at the University of Minnesota before opening their new indoor venue in 2016. They'll also have one fewer home game this fall, too, when they ""host"" the Pittsburgh Steelers in London on Sept. 29.4. THE NEW DEAL, ON THE DEFENSIVE LINE: The front four has long been a strength of this franchise, from the Alan Page-led Purple People Eaters to the era of Hall of Fame pass rushers Chris Doleman and John Randle to the current group led by Jared Allen. But Allen, fellow defensive ends Everson Griffen and Brian Robison and stalwart defensive tackle Kevin Williams have all begun the final year of their current contracts. Given age, productivity and salary cap factors, envisioning all of them still around in 2014 is all but impossible. So not only will these guys need to re-establish their worth, for either their present employer or other teams on the open market, but the Vikings themselves must make some important decisions about who to invest in for the future. First-round draft pick Sharrif Floyd is in line to replace Williams, a six-time Pro Bowl pick.5. STILL UNDER SIDELINE SCRUTINY: Despite the feel-good vibe and vast improvement he helped produce last season, Leslie Frazier hasn't yet secured his future with the franchise. The Vikings routinely exercised their option for 2014 on his contract, but since coaches rarely enter the final year of a deal without an extension, this is another prove-it season for Frazier, a subject he has tread carefully around in public.___Follow Dave Campbell on Twitter: www.twitter.com/DaveCampbellAP___Online: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org"
