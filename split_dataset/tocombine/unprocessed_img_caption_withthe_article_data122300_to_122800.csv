The confirmed death toll on Sunday was 187.South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy and one of its leading manufacturing and export powerhouses, has developed into one of the world's most technically advanced countries, but faces criticism that regulatory controls have not kept pace.As part of the investigation, prosecutors raided two shipping safety watchdogs and a coastguard office. They have also raided two vessel service centres, which act as maritime traffic control.Chung's resignation was approved by President Park Geun-hye, who has the most power in government, although her spokesman said later that he would remain in post until the rescue operation was completed.""Keeping my post is too great a burden on the administration,"" a sombre Chung said in a brief announcement. ""...On behalf of the government, I apologise for many problems from the prevention of the accident to the early handling of the disaster.""There are too many irregularities and malpractices in parts of society that have been with us too long and I hope those are corrected so that accidents like this will not happen again.""Chung was booed and someone threw a water bottle at him when he visited grieving parents the day after the disaster. President Park was also booed by some relatives when she visited a gym where families of the missing were staying.Tempers have frayed over the slow pace of the recovery and frequent changes in information provided by the government.The Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education sent text messages to parents that ""All Danwon High School students are rescued"" in the hours after the disaster, media reported.(Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Michael Perry & Kim Coghill)"
1,POLITICS,How Elizabeth Warren's Own Book Makes The Case She Should Run For President,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-president_n_5219265.html,,2014-04-27,"FILE - In this March 7, 2013 file photo, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pauses while questioning a witness at Senate Banking Committee hearing on anti-money laundering on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Massachusetts Democrat is working on a book she plans to call ""Rigged."" During a brief telephone interview Tuesday, March 19, 2013, with The Associated Press, she said ""Rigged"" will be a ""first-hand"" account of her battles for the middle class. She will write about helping to set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and her senate campaign in 2012. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c622240000310098f0f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren is adamant that she is not seeking to move up to the White House.""I am not running for president,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told The Huffington Post, as she has told many others. ""You can ask that question any way you want, but you're going to get the same answer.""That's not exactly the question HuffPost was asking, though. The question was why readers of her new memoir and political treatise, A Fighting Chance, shouldn't take from it a very powerful argument for why Warren should run.All through the book, despite her Shermanesque declarations of non-intent, can be found passages that suggest the logical next step for the middle-class girl from Oklahoma who grew into a champion for social justice is to seek the office where she could have the greatest impact.Indeed, the argument for why she should attempt to go beyond even her unlikely ascension to the U.S. Senate two years ago begins on Page 2 of her book. ""I am determined -- fiercely determined -- to do everything I can to help us once again be the America that creates opportunities for anyone who works hard and plays by the rules. An America of accountability and fair play. An America that builds a future for not just some of our children but for all of our children. An America where everyone gets what I got: a fighting chance,"" Warren writes.Perhaps Warren does not think that climbing onto the high-profile platform of a presidential bid lands in the category of doing ""everything I can."" But her book also shows how often in her public career she looked at the lay of the land and said no, or at least hesitated. She often had to be convinced.When former Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) asked Warren to join the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in 1995, she balked at first, but was then convinced by the opportunity to improve the laws in concrete ways. Not long after, Synar died, and the goal all but died with him.President Bill Clinton appointed a lawyer named Brady Williamson to continue the work.""When Brady called, I was blunt: Mike and I had a deal, but that was then. Mike is gone, and I'm out of here,"" Warren recounts in her book. Williamson responded that ordinary bankrupt Americans had no political clout, that banks would make a bad situation worse if they dictated the commission's work, and that even though Warren couldn't make the reforms she had initially hoped, every day that they at least preserved the best aspects of the old laws was a day that some 5,000 people could use them to get a fresh start.""Lord this was discouraging,"" Warren writes of their conversation. ""But I signed on, and we started stacking sandbags as quick as we could. Maybe we'd lose in the end, but every day we held on was a better day for struggling families.""Helping people trumped her distaste for the project. It was a similar situation when President Barack Obama asked her to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He wanted her to set it up, but -- for political reasons -- not to lead it.She told him no at first, fearing she wouldn't have the authority to build the agency that she thought was needed. Obama pleaded for her to trust him before she finally decided she would do it.And when Democrats wanted her to run for the Senate seat in Massachusetts, she writes, ""I really didn't want to run. I'd had enough of Washington."" Her family was telling her, ""We love you and we don't want to see you hurt. Please stay out.""But she thought about what a senator could accomplish:[T]here was so much at stake in this election. I'd spent nearly twenty years fighting to level the playing field for the middle class, and I'd seen millions of working families go over the economic cliff -- and it was getting worse. What kind of country would my grandchildren grow up in? What if the conservatives and the big banks and the big-time CEOs got their way, and Washington kept helping the rich and powerful to get richer and more powerful? Could I really stand on the sidelines and stay out of this fight?So she dipped her toe in the water, visiting small gatherings around the Bay State, until she met a woman who had walked miles to meet her. Warren writes that she decided to run after she was moved by this woman's tale. The woman declared, ""I don't care how hard it gets, I want to know that you are going to fight.""In her book, Warren, who used to teach Sunday school, suggests that she has an almost religious calling to fight the good fight. She explains how she's inspired by the words of the King James Bible and how she offered their wisdom in a visit to a church.""I stood up, and I talked about my favorite Bible verse, Matthew 25:40,"" she writes. ""I told people what it meant to me. It's message was very simple: The Lord calls us to action. It's what we do that matters most.""Her takeaway from defeating Republican Sen. Scott Brown in 2012 has a similar tone.""What is the lesson of that day? When we fight, we can win. And when we get really fired up and fight shoulder to shoulder, we can do some pretty amazing things,"" she writes. ""Some say the rich and powerful now control Washington and always will. I say this battle isn't over yet. True, the playing field isn't level and the system is rigged. But we're putting up a heck of a fight, and we intend to keep on fighting.""If such comments -- found throughout the book -- don't make an argument for Warren to try for the White House, here are the final two paragraphs:No one is asking for a handout. All we want is a country where everyone pays a fair share, a country where we build opportunities for all of us, a country where everyone plays by the same rules and everyone is held accountable. And we have begun to fight for it.Warren can probably count on hearing those words come back to her many times over the coming months.Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.

I am not telling you to watch MTP or not, or whether Gregory should stay or leave -- but I am telling you that it is NBC executives (""the suits"") who are all over this. They are shooting Gregory and shooting themselves in the foot. They are unnecessarily disrupting an entire news organization that reaches beyond Gregory.The NBC executives could have nipped these MTP stories in the bud... but now they are growing and growing. Once the media stampede starts, it is hard to stop. Others in the media jump on them, spread the stories and even the snarky people enjoy them. These recent stories about Gregory are awful -- who is planting them or causing them? Who are the anonymous sources? Certainly not Gregory. If a network wants to, it can destroy a talent. If a network wants to fight for that talent, it can, and not just with wimpy press statements -- no one buys those -- but proving it with what they do with the talent. They need to prove it... do something... real proof, not a dopey press release or statement that no one believes.There is a predictable pattern in TV news when a network begins to drag or even hit the skids. A new top executive is hired in some important job who wants to put his giant mark on the network and fast. Big bucks, and big PR surround the new executive hire and the executive goes into panic mode -- how to fix the network fast, overnight. He believes he knows all (he got hired, right?) And he (or she) is desperate to make some giant statement of some sort with some major decision.Often a news corporate executive has been only that -- an executive -- and while that is an important set of skills, the executive has little or no idea what it means to do a news show. You need that, too... not to mention good common sense about what you are doing to the institution as you think how to fix it. A news show needs real support from the company -- that includes ample resources and not getting thrown under the bus by your own company.Instability at a network, caused by a shakeup in the programming or rumors of it, not only disrupts the direct victim but makes all the others who work at the network nervous, wondering if they are next. And when you are busy worrying about if you are next, you are not working on your show, your job. I saw this when AOL/Time Warner bought CNN in 2001. The hallway anchor chatter goes from discussing news and bookings to ""who is getting fired? or why are the suits in town today?""A network or an executive who lets his stars get whacked in the media (and don't tell me that could not be stopped) is hurting the network.A network executive who comes to a network with grandiose ideas and who turns the network upside down with big changes fast is likewise making a big mistake. Network improvement can't happen fast. It is far smarter to tinker with the existing programming than do those huge changes that seem to only generate short term headlines for the new executives. Networks have loyal viewers and many network executives make the mistake of programming and hiring for themselves and their close friends, not the viewers.And some new network executives do silly stuff like dump the brand that has held the network together for years. Larry King is a good example. When he got pushed out he was #1 in all of CNN programming. Yes, his ratings were down but they sure were better than anybody's else at CNN. I would not have booted my #1 guy... he would be my last boot.That doesn't mean an anchor should stay forever, or a show forever, but at least have enough sense to know what is and has been working for the network and don't start with your best. Why do new executives do this? I think they do it for themselves. I think they think the big headlines with these big moves is somehow going to draw viewers. It just hasn't happened that way.I have no inside scoop on Gregory. Of course eventually, if the network doesn't step up and back up their talent, Gregory will bite the dust. The stampede will win. His career will be tarnished. I don't like that. He should get a fair shake from everyone -- his network and the media and everyone else.By the way, as you read the articles, you might want to think about this. Often the stuff you read in the paper about TV news gossip is just silly stuff -- pasted together from anonymous sources and from reading and sourcing others' anonymous sourced articles about the same topic. It is the telephone game.Here is an example. Remember last July when many well known news organizations were saying I was getting pushed out of Fox News Channel? They were writing those stories and copying and quoting each other -- and their sources? Anonymous. Two months earlier, in May, I had just signed a new long term dream contract. When I signed my new contract in May, I didn't talk about it. It is a confidential deal and I keep my word. It got pretty silly in July when the stampede began about me -- and many journalists soiled themselves with their silly -- false -- stories based on anonymous sources.After enough stories, I finally asked Fox to give me permission to break the confidentially clause of my contract, so I could shut down the false rumors. I wanted to do it myself. Fox News said ok. But Fox News Channel is unusual. I appreciate Fox for this. I am not sure other networks would allow a talent to do that. Many networks are afraid to have talent/anchors talk and thus media contracts put the lid on talent so the narrative is controlled by the media corporation. Some news organizations seem content to let the talent fry.By the way, you know from reading GretaWire how much I hate the overuse of anonymous sources so I have kept copies of all those articles about me. Some day I hope to write a book about journalists' insatiable appetite for anonymous sources and how it has undermined the credibility of journalism. It is not uncommon to find that an explosive article is written, sourced to an anonymous source... then, if you wait a bit and track the original anonymous source story... the facts emerge weeks, months later... and you see that the journalist in the original piece was lazy and did not pursue a good source ON THE RECORD and simply was used by some rat to do a drive-by ambush. WARNING: there is a REASON ANONYMOUS SOURCES WANT TO BE ANONYMOUS.And one last note to others in the media and who are snarky and enjoying the articles about Gregory: you may enjoy them now... but you may be next. Loyalty is rare in this business.And if you are thinking, what stories about David Gregory? Here are two screen shots of the turmoil in just the last 24 or so hours (and even though the executives may say they are standing behind him, they got themselves, and worse, Gregory, into this): "

GEKA is federally-funded and its sole function is the destruction of chemical weapons from military arsenals. Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons last August and disposal, which is already underway on an American ship in the Mediterranean, is scheduled to be completed by June.

The Syrian government has insisted the delays are an inevitable part of trying to dismantle and move a dangerous chemical weapons arsenal in a time of war, but Western governments have accused it of intentionally stalling.Critics of the deal point to the fact that despite progress on chemical weapons, there are few if any other signs that the war slowed -- or that the intensity with which both sides have waged it has decreased.In lieu of chemical weapons, government forces have turned to dropping deadly, makeshift ""barrel bombs"" on rebel-held and residential areas, most prominently in Aleppo, where the devices have killed a thousand or more people.And more recently, the regime has been accused by rebel groups of turning to another chemical to attack opposition areas: chlorine, which is not technically on the OPCW's list of banned ingredients.The government has strongly denied that it has used chlorine and has pinned the blame on the rebel groups themselves.Meanwhile, the OPCW's Kaag said that of the 7.5 percent of the country's lethal chemical stores still in the country, the majority consists of disparate raw materials, and the facilities required to create weapons out of them -- or, for that matter, to launch attacks with them -- have been destroyed.""What remains are the elements of a chemical weapon, but the chemical weapons programme of Syria, as per the current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention, is no longer in existence,"" she said."

One police lieutenant, who was sitting in a police vehicle nearby, said it would have been pointless to intervene.It was the first time the station had been seized by the separatists, though previously a transmission tower in the Donetsk region had briefly been seized and technicians forced to broadcast Russian stations' output.Pro-Russian separatists, some of them armed, have seized about a dozen official buildings in eastern Ukraine. They say they are rising up against a Ukrainian government they say is illegitimate, but Kiev says they are proxies of the Russian government bent on destabilising Ukraine.About an hour after the station in Donetsk was overrun, it was still broadcasting its scheduled programmes, a children's show called ""Circle of the Sun"". CHANGING CHANNELSBut the station's director, Oleg Dzholos, who came outside to speak to reporters, said the people who seized the building had ordered him to change the programming.""They used force to push back the gates,"" he said. ""There were no threats. There were not many of my people. What can a few people do? The leaders of this movement just gave me an ultimatum that one of the Russian channels has to be broadcast.""Dzholos said three of his staff were still inside the building, and that the separatists had not ejected him from his office.Separatists who swear allegiance to the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic already control the regional governor's office and the city hall in Donetsk, the regional capital.A man in a white shirt who came out of the building and said he was a representative of the Donetsk People's Republic said that from now on the station would be broadcasting Rossiya 24, a Russian state-owned news channel.Earlier, a crowd of around 400 people surrounded the building and shouted ""Russia!"" and ""Referendum!,"" a reference to a vote the separatists want to hold on seceding from Ukraine. The protesters later drifted away, but the separatist guards on the doors remained.One of the masked men at the entrance, asked why the building had been seized, said: ""They show lies, they try to influence the people and they broadcast misinformation.""The police officer sitting in his vehicle nearby, who gave his name as Vitaly, said his superiors had ordered him to protect the building after they received information that a crowd was heading to the television station.""I don't see any point in using force,"" he said. ""It would not have worked if we had tried to stop anybody, there were a lot of people here."" (Reporting by Maria Tsvetkova; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Nigel Stephenson)"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) passed through New Hampshire over the weekend, paying a visit to former Gov. John H. Sununu, the NH Journal reported Sunday.Sununu, an establishment Republican, said the visit was purely social.“Let’s put it this way,” Sununu told the Journal, “we didn’t talk about anything serious. It was a ‘glad to meet you’ kind of thing, and if he in the end comes back to New Hampshire, he knows he has a place he can stop by for a free cup of coffee.""“It was really no more than that,” Sununu continued. “They called and asked if he could stop by and of course I’m willing to meet with any and all Republicans at any time. We really just had a nice friendly talk.”New Hampshire is the first state to host the presidential primary election each cycle.

Elizabeth Warren, center, greets the crowd before speaking during the annual St. Patrick's Day Breakfast in Boston, Sunday, March 16, 2014. Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland, left, and Rep. Stephen Lynch, right, look on. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c6193c000066000df427.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Warren's new book is not just a memoir, or even a modern declaration of liberal values, the Democratic Massachusetts senator said in an interview. It's an appeal to all Americans to get up, go out and take back their government.""I want to pull more people into this fight. This fight isn't just my fight. This fight isn't just a fight for progressives,"" Warren told HuffPost. ""This fight is America's fight. I wrote this book hoping that lots of different people would pick it up and read it, hoping that they would see themselves in this book and know that they have to be part of the fight.""Warren tries to do that in A Fighting Chance by telling her own life story, reaching back to her childhood in Oklahoma, when her family bumped along at the bottom edge of the middle class.She offers her tale as someone who started her life and career not especially interested in politics, but came to her views through experiences shared by many Americans and knowledge acquired by studying, teaching and then advocating around bankruptcy law.There were her family's early hardships after her father suffered a heart attack. Later, there were problems in her first marriage in the 1970s trying to juggle a husband, children and a career. As the book recounts her advances in the world and her more rarefied battles in Washington, Warren is careful to keep it human, with tales of how her parents and aunt helped her, how she helped them, and later, how the weight of her granddaughter in her arms was so important to her.The idea is that if people relate to Warren and her experiences, it helps them care about the ideas she advocates -- cutting the income gap, rebuilding infrastructure, reinvesting in education, and making government listen to regular Americans more than the rich and the powerful who can game the system.""Books are part of how I fight for what I believe in,"" said Warren. ""That's what this is about. It's about trying to pull more people into the fight."" Warren has authored several other books, perhaps most famously The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle Class Parents Are Going Broke, which she wrote with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi. They sold well for research-based books, and had their share of influence on policymakers. But Warren is trying to go further with her new volume by motivating a broader audience.She explained why she thinks more Americans need to get involved.""The game is rigged,"" Warren said in a refrain of a message she's been delivering on her nationwide book tour. And there's really only one way for regular people to straighten out the game.""Those with money and power have loud voices in Washington,"" Warren said. ""Everyone else has only their own voices and their votes. So this book is about the importance of using our voices together, using our votes to level the playing field. That's all we've got. That's what have to work with. And if we don't organize and make our views heard, then the rich will keep getting richer and the powerful keep getting more powerful, and this country tilts out of control.""Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.
