Or meaningless.",2013-03-29,"FILE In this Aug. 3, 2011 file photo, a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checks passenger's carry on luggage at the security checkpoint at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta. The federal government is escalating security around the country in preparation for the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and conducting confidential briefings with state and local law enforcement organizations. But officials say there is no specific indication that a terror plot against the U.S. is under way. (AP Photo/Erik S. Lesser, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfadf2200005700d9737d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wanna insult a reporter? There's no easier way than accusing him or her of being a shill for the other side, of churning out propaganda instead of covering a subject.And that's especially true when it comes to the TSA.But consider the following ""exclusive"" story from a local ABC affiliate, which aired a few weeks ago.It was an earnest report about the imminent dangers of a terrorist weapon being detonated on a plane. Explosives ""experts"" at Camp Pendleton in California rigged shoes and laptop computers and blew them up in front of a group of TSA trainees. They even let a reporter incinerate one of the props from a safe distance.  It made for terrific TV and it helped the TSA make the point that it, and its $8 billion a year budget, were urgently needed to keep America safe. Such demonstrations are a staple of the TSA publicity machine.But as is so often the case, it's not what was said, but what was not said, that made this report the latest feather in the TSA's PR cap.The reporter failed to mention that TSA agents aren't given any explosives training, so the exercise had no educational value beyond showing that plastic explosives go ""boom.""She also omitted the fact that not a single terrorist has ever tried to get a liquid bomb or plastic explosives through a TSA checkpoint. Instead, wannabe terrorists like the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber looked for vulnerabilities overseas, where the TSA has little or no jurisdiction. If you're going to demonstrate America's security prowess, maybe a foreign airport is a good place to start.Put differently, the entire display was for show. The TSA could have detonated grenades, set up an archery range, even set off a small nuclear weapon -- it would have been just as meaningful.Or meaningless.We're easily impressedI can't blame a journalist for filing that kind of piece. Few news outlets have a full-time national security reporter. Dangle an ""exclusive"" in front of them, maybe give them a few hours to edit the story, and they just can't help themselves. Calling an outside expert to help put the TSA's pyrotechnics into perspective might have been impractical.I want to believe that.But an outsider might have said this: TSA agents are about as capable of disarming an incendiary device as a bomb-sniffing dog. The agents watching from the bleachers are screeners, not law enforcement officials. In the sense that they're helping air travelers through the security process, they are primarily in the customer-service business.I would have been much more impressed if the TSA had shown a seminar with Miss Manners, in which new agents are taught how to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" instead of barking and prodding.But I digress.Fact is, we're easily wowed by demonstrations like the one shown to ABC. Also, journalists tend to instinctively trust something an official tells them, whether it's true or not.ABC shouldn't feel singled out. In the recent past, outlets from National Public Radio to NBC News have also filed fawning reports that do little more than help perpetuate the TSA's ""permanent emergency"" and fuel public fears that help it secure more funding.We shouldn't beBias is difficult to detect. Even when you think you detect it, it's almost impossible to prove. Reporters on deadline don't always have time to think about the other side, and if they aren't subject matter experts, they may not even be aware there is another side.It's not an excuse. In journalism school, there's a saying: ""If your mother says she loves you, check it out."" It's what I like to call the Fox Mulder principle: Trust no one. It's one of the most difficult lessons to learn when you're a reporter, particularly when your sources seem to be so trustworthy.Be critical, even when it will cause some to question your patriotism. Especially then.I'm not going to pretend to be unbiased. I'm on the side of the consumer, and travelers are not well served when the TSA trumps up false threats or exaggerates its role in keeping America's transportation systems safe.In the meantime, maybe the best advice I can give is this: don't believe everything you read."

This version, brimming with sweet pork sausage and sharp cheddar, is deeply flavored with a crisp, golden crust and tender, creamy interior. I love it, not only because it's delicious, but also because it can be made ahead of time and feeds a crowd.The recipe was given to me by one of my oldest and closest friends, Kelly Santoro. She got it from her friend, Corey, who got it from his mother, who in turn got it from an old spiral-bound fundraising cookbook. Such is the path of a good recipe!As you can see, I use plain ol' white sandwich bread -- there's no need for anything fancy here. As for the sausage, some grocers sell sausage meat in bulk or out of the casings (as shown above). This makes life easier but if you can't find it, just remove the casings. The best way is to cut the casings with kitchen shears and peel them away from the meat (see below). This is much easier than trying to squeeze the meat out.Begin by cutting the crusts off the bread.Then, cut the bread into 1-inch cubes.Brown the sausage in a large pan.As the sausage cooks, use a wooden spoon to break the meat up into small clumps.Transfer the browned sausage to a large bowl, then cook the onions in the same pan until they're soft and translucent.Grate your cheddar. I think it's easiest to do it in the food processor but you can use a hand-held grater as well.Combine the bread, sausage, cheddar and fresh parsley in a large bowl.Then transfer the mixture to a buttered baking dish.Make the custard by whisking together the eggs, salt, pepper and half-and-half.Then pour the custard evenly over the bread mixture.Cover and refrigerate for at least a few hours or overnight. When you're ready to serve, bake in a 350-degree oven for about an hour, until puffed, golden and crisp on top.GET THE RECIPEGET THE RECIPE"

Trader Joe's, a specialty retail grocery store, has more than 200 stores in 19 states. (Photo by Michael Nagle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfbc826000036007fb139.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday, grocery giant Trader Joe's was hit with a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of intentionally mislabeling several of its branded packaged foods to make them seem healthier than they are. Plaintiffs Amy Gitson, Christine Vodicka and Deborah Ross, all Bay Area residents, sued because, according to the lawsuit, the ""evaporated cane juice"" and ""organic evaporated cane juice"" listed as ingredients in Trader Joe's brand yogurt and soy milk were actually just normal sugar. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has banned the term ""evaporated cane juice"" as a synonym for sugar on packaged foods, but the use of the term has become increasingly common over the past few years.The suit also accuses Trader Joe's of falsely claiming that several of its products contain no artificial flavors, ingredients or preservatives. The complaint cites the brand's French Village Strawberry Nonfat Yogurt, which is tinted with beet juice, and Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Salted Caramel Truffles, which contain one of a class of chemical preservatives called tocopherols, as examples of mislabeled products. Trader Joe's spokeswoman Alison Mochizuici told The Huffington Post Friday the company cannot comment on pending litigation.Gitson, Vodicka and Ross are asking the court to grant them, and similarly aggrieved parties across the country, monetary compensation for what they characterize as fraud on the part of Trader Joe's. They also want Trader Joe's to change its labels.They're represented by Pierce Gore, a consumer affairs attorney who has been on a legal crusade against food mislabeling since April 2012, when he filed nine lawsuits (on behalf of different clients) based on erroneous labels. Over the past 11 months, he's filed similar suits against 32 companies selling mislabeled foods, including six of the 20 biggest food companies in the world: Kraft, Nestle, Frito-Lay, Hershey's, Dole and ConAgra. Last August, The New York Times retail reporter Stephanie Strom compared the campaign to the war on tobacco companies in the mid-90s -- a war Gore not-so-coincidentally helped wage. Speaking by phone from his San Jose, Calif., law firm Pratt & Associates, Gore told The Huffington Post that he started the fight after looking into the FDA's regulations on packaged food labeling. He said he figured out that a huge number of companies were in violation. ""The labeling on packaged food is just a sea of lies,"" he said. ""It's difficult to describe the breadth of the problem. American consumers are being systematically lied to about the foods they eat.""Gore said he also quickly figured out that the FDA didn't have the resources to go after mislabelers. ""We're trying to enforce laws for which there is no other enforcement mechanism,"" he said.He also realized that the laws in California, unlike those in many other states, allowed private individuals to sue companies over false food-labeling claims. So he started casting about for potential plaintiffs -- who weren't hard to find in health-conscious San Francisco. (Many, including the plaintiffs in the Trader Joe's case, are friends or acquaintances of lawyers at Pratt & Associates.) California law doesn't require plaintiffs to have been physically injured by a company to sue it; they need only to prove ""economic injury."" ""We just have to prove that people didn't get what they paid for. It is illegal to distribute, sell or even possess misbranded food in California,"" Gore explained. ""Our plaintiffs bought products that weren't legal to sell.""Many of the suits, like the one against Trader Joe's, target companies' use of the term ""evaporated cane juice."" But others take aim at nebulous health claims like ""no sugar added"" and ""all natural"" which lend foods and beverages the air of healthfulness without signifying anything. In November, for example, one of Gore's clients sued Whole Foods for labeling its in-house brand 365 Everyday Value Cola as ""all natural"" even though it contains caramel flavoring, citric acid and carbon dioxide.In each of the 32 cases, Gore's plaintiffs are asking to be compensated in the form of a partial or total refund for the mislabeled products they bought. They are also asking the companies being sued to change their labels. Gore said that he'd noticed, over the past year, that several packaged food manufacturers had removed the term ""evaporated cane juice"" from their packages, which he chalked up to fear of a lawsuit.None of the cases have been decided, but five of the defendants unsuccessfully filed motions to dismiss their suits.""We haven't lost yet,"" he said. ""And we're not going to, because the law is pretty clear. We allege not only consumer deception, but actual regulatory violations. That's the difference between us and previous labeling suits. It's a lot harder to research the regulation -- but we feel like we've built a better mousetrap."""

She noted that in the past few years, McDonald's has added oatmeal dishes, chicken sandwiches with buns that boast 8 grams of whole grains and a new Happy Meal with apples and a smaller portion of fries. Chocolate milk, once 1 percent fat, is now fat-free. ""All of that came from careful listening to moms in particular and recognizing people are becoming more mindful about what they're putting in their mouth,"" she said.Goody went on to declare that processed food could ""absolutely"" be healthy, offering up examples from her own diet:I'm a mom of a 2-year-old and I gained the prerequisite [sic] 30 pounds and I was able to lose all that baby weight. I don't have a fast metabolism and I eat at McDonald's once or twice a day. Really. Plus I work out the recommended 5 hours a week. I may eat an Egg McMuffin and apples. My new thing is to have either a hamburger or a double hamburger, no cheese, two bags of apple slices and an oatmeal cookie and still keeping it under 600 calories.Goody spoke to the Tribune as part of McDonald's promotion of its new McWrap line. Earlier this week, Advertising Age wrote about an internal McDonald's memo that referred to the McWrap has a ""Subway buster""; McDonald's hopes to chip away at its rival's popularity with millennial customers. Depending on whether one chooses grilled or deep-fried chicken, the wraps range from 360 to 600 calories.According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest study, Subway's eight children's offerings are exceptions to the usual fast food fare for kids. All met the center's nutrition criteria; kid-sized subs at Subway come with apple slices; and low-fat milk or bottled water is offered in place of soda."

Consider the first smile of your day your first and most important workout. Your heart and your mind will be the better for it.",2013-03-28,"Woman poses in front of the ocean, her hair falling over one eye, wearing her trousseau of chic fitted blazer and fashionable faux pearl necklace.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf5d52400005000536683.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We've all heard the old adage ""it takes 43 muscles to frown, and just 17 to smile,"" a fact that of course begs the question: Why don't we all smile more often? We know that a smile can light up someone else's day as well as our own, but still, it seems that these days smiles are in short supply. And let's face it, there are those days when you flash a smile at a stranger hoping for one in return, and the only response you elicit is a deeper scowl and a look of confusion. A smile, by all accounts, is universal -- a language without words, a communication that requires no translation. No matter where you are, a smile can speak volumes when you cannot. In the deepest, darkest corners of the world where refugees struggle to survive, and where I arrive, a stranger who doesn't speak the language, a genuine smile introduces me more purely than announcing my name ever will. My smile declares that I am eager and open and interested, and that I am there to work alongside them. A genuine smile transcends, well, everything -- religion, politics, and even borders. None of that matters in the sudden burst of an unexpected smile. And a smile provides more than comfort for ourselves or someone else. A smile releases endorphins, those happiness signals that surge through our bodies and brains and convince our inner selves that we are happy, confident and satisfied, and when we take the time to direct a genuine smile at another person, our endorphins spin through our brains and we feel almost immediately a tiny ripple of happiness. Try it -- no matter your mood, smile. And then smile again -- and like magic, you'll feel the first stirrings of happiness. It's hard to fight the effects of a simple smile, and harder still to frown when you feel good. Now, try a smile on that perpetually snarling person you see each morning on the bus or the street. Whatever sadness or worry lurks behind their sulking scowl a smile can often, at the very least, ease that scowl into a tiny bit of a grin. It won't always work -- there are those who will look at you as though you are quite mad before they scurry away. But there are so many more, myself included, who will welcome the warmth that a smile provides. Try it on that coworker who seems weighed down, shoulders slumped, eyes and mouth pulled into a permanent pout. And, more likely than not, the recipient will smile in turn, and that smile will make your endorphins swell with the joy that only a smile can provide.Smile as often as you can. Smile at a friend, a lover, a stranger, or smile to yourself -- the most powerful smile of all because if you exude joy, you spread joy.It does take effort to smile, to be engaged in your world, in your surroundings, but once you smile, the rewards are endless. So with that in mind, consider the first smile of your day your first and most important workout. Your heart and your mind will be the better for it.For more on happiness, click here.For more by Roberta Gately, click here. "

Awesome! One particular person made his comment public on my website and for that, cheers to you, John! I had mentioned in a reply that ""the world may be missing out on what you have to offer"" and so it was. John's comment: ""You're right -- everyone has a voice. We just have different amplifiers!"" Thank you John for putting yourself out there, YOU inspired me!My husband and I are always volleying back and forth, harmlessly teasing each other. He often refers to me as LT, which is short for Loud Talker. I will always smile and say, ""Well, thank you babe!"" taking it as a compliment. As I talk, I get louder and most times, tend to pick up speed. A conversation between my sister and I is quite entertaining and sounds more like Alvin and the Chipmunks on speed. I owe this all to my passion about whatever I am speaking about at that time, to my uncontrollable ADD and having to get the thought out before I lose it forever, and to growing up an Enwright. Imagine a bunch of first-generation old school LTs, all passionate about their views whether wrong or right, all vying for the microphone. Family gatherings do not only blow your mind but your eardrums too! Needless to say, my amplifier is always turned on.I know people who are beautiful inside and out, people who have a smile as big as their heart and a laugh to match, people who would do most anything for anyone. Their song is beautiful! Probably something like Sheryl Crow's ""All I Wanna Do,"" but try to dig a little deep, put them in the middle of a social circle or at a public event, and the spark in their eye fades and REM and Johnny Cash are going head to head for an unplugged version of ""Everybody Hurts.""Whether we are loud-mouthed or shy, extroverts or introverts, whether we have an inept ability to communicate thoughts, ideas and emotions or not, we all have a voice inside of us. But exactly as John insinuated, some of our amplifiers may just not be that loud. A voice can be heard, seen and felt. There is a voice in action, as well as standing on a soapbox. As a mom and a LT, I try to teach my children to speak up, to convey their feelings and thoughts and to not be shy. I purposefully do not impress my opinions and feelings on them but try to listen and nurture their heart's song. As parents, we are our children's advocate. We are here to speak for them if need be. As human beings, we have a natural tendency to be advocates for those less fortunate. As the mother of a son with Down syndrome, I thought I was using my voice, singing my song to pave the way for him in hopes of continued acceptance. What I have learned is my song has no genre.What is it that moves you to be heard? Is it you or someone else's despair, a family or friend's passion? A vision of a better place? Anger, equality, injustice? What are we, as a collective people, missing out on because your song is not being sung? Are you a painter, a writer, a musician? Do you have a thought that may provoke change? An idea, invention?I don't claim to know all the answers. Heck, I'm lucky if I even know where my car keys are. However, I think I have become quite the expert on me and somehow keeping it all peacefully in tune while juggling this crazy circus. (I prefer carnival over circus, but it wasn't as eloquent. Come on, cotton candy over peanuts, rides over animals, outdoors over Big Top -- there really is no competition.) I believe we all have a desire for peace, love and happiness internally, eternally. I have found this and want to share it like Paul Revere's ""The British are coming!"" Listen, learn and love your song! Then sing it! It is your voice, amplified or acoustic!PS: I wonder if we all sang our songs together if it would be in perfect harmony.

Pinpoint the things that typically make school mornings stressful,2013-03-28,Two grade school age children walking to school or school bus stop.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf5ce240000500094e39a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This post is part of Stress-Less Parenting Club's new workshop. Check out previous posts here, and if you haven’t signed up yet, go to the purple box on the right side of this page to receive our weekly newsletter.You can't wear that sundress to school -- it's too cold outside! Put on something warmer! Where are your shoes? Your hair looks like a rat's nest! Where's your backpack? Oh no, we're out of cold cuts for sandwiches! Where did I put that permission form for the school trip to the zoo? School mornings can easily turn into complete fiascos. One little thing can throw off the whole morning. Christine Koh and Asha Dornfest, the leaders of our second Stress-Less Parenting workshop, emphasize in their new book Minimalist Parenting the importance of having predictable routines to ""streamline they rhythm of the school day."" As Asha writes in her new blog post, ""the more I was able to create simple, repeatable routines for myself and the kids, the more time-efficient we all became. Everything, from getting ready for school to packing lunches to managing the after-school backpack explosion and weeknight cooking, got easier and took less time (which meant more time to relax).""For this week's workshop, Christine and Asha offer their best advice for starting school mornings off right:STREAMLINING SCHOOL MORNINGSWe’ve found that the best “getting ready for school” routine begins the night before. Think of it as setting up the dominoes before the effortless knockdown in the morning. As your kids get older, hand the elements of the routine over to them.* Lay Out Clothes * Detangle Hair * Get a Head Start on Lunch Packing * Line Up Backpacks and Lunch Bags * Run and Empty the Dishwasher * Set Out the Breakfast Dishes * Sign Permission Slips, Gather Milk Money, Etc * Get After-School Necessities TogetherThe keys to a mostly successful morning launch are to have a plan and to stay calm.  Getting sucked into the drama and cranky morning moods escalates the bad feelings all around. Try to project cool conﬁdence (pretend if you must) -- hopefully, the kids will take your behavior cues. How the plan actually looks is up to you and your situation. Variables include the presence of other helpful (and awake) adults, the number and ages of your kids, whether or not you’re getting ready for work at the same time, distance to school, and general “morning person” temperaments. Keep in mind that no routine is perfect out of the gate -- routines are meant to be tweaked. No matter how your routine shapes up, the more you model “ﬁrst we do this, and then we do that,” the sooner your kids will do it themselves.Wake Up Earlier Than Your Kids Try to get up at least 10 minutes before the kids do. Not only do you deserve some alone time with your coffee, you’ll feel more in control when the action begins.Encourage Your Kids to Use an Alarm Clock Get an alarm clock for each of your kids and begin using it, no matter their ages. The sooner kids get used to waking themselves, the easier everyone’s mornings will go.Swap Morning Wake Ups If your kids have different wake-up times, swap which parent gets up ﬁrst each morning.Say Yes to Breakfast A good breakfast is a must for a productive school day, and it’s a nice time to connect before everyone goes their separate ways. Even late sleepers and those with tiny morning appetites need to eat, so try to make breakfast a priority. Preview the Day With Your Kids Get in the habit of previewing the day with your kids to remind them about upcoming events and tasks, and to get them in the habit of planning ahead. Set Time “Signposts” Try to break the morning routine into its natural “shifts” -- for example, breakfast, getting dressed, brushing hair and teeth, heading out the door. The shifts will be unique to your speciﬁc routine. Next, attach times to each shift, such as “breakfast is ﬁnished at 8 a.m.” Kids can better pace themselves when they’re aware of their progress through the routine.End on a High Note No matter how the morning goes down, try to end with a positive send-off. You’re working on building habits, and there will be good days and bad days. In the grand scheme of things, progress counts more than straight-line success. Besides, no one will remember the tardy passes in a few years.THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGEQ&AWhat are the toughest parts of school mornings for you? What have you done in your house to make them go smoother? As you think about this week's challenge, we also invite you to leave your thoughts and tricks in the comments or to tweet them to us @HuffPostParents.Excerpted with permission from Minimalist Parenting: Enjoy Modern Family Life More by Doing Less by Christine Koh and Asha Dornfest (Bibliomotion, March 2013)."

First I want to ask you what you think about it.Then I want to tell you what I did yesterday.I shoveled oysters. My husband and I have a small oyster farm, and we were freeing our overwintered crop from the densely packed trays that had helped them brave the Barnstable Harbor ice, and transferring them to the sparsely packed trays in which they will grow out this spring. All told, we had to shovel some 1,400 pounds of oysters and muck into 40 boxes of about 35 pounds each, and then carry each box to an empty tray and dump it.Part of the reason we decided to farm oysters is that, if we're going to do hard physical work, we prefer to do it on a farm than at a gym. We find the work gratifying and constructive, and we hope it's helping us fend off decrepitude. But the labor that keeps us fit also keeps oysters expensive. If farmers can't make a living, farming isn't viable, and food prices have to reflect the time and money we invest in the enterprise. Now, back to the GM salmon. It's an Atlantic salmon with one gene from a Chinook salmon and another from an ocean pout which, together, ensure that the fish produces growth hormone year-round, rather than only part-time. The AquAdvantage fish reportedly grows more than twice as fast as its unmodified brethren.That translates to less feed, less labor, fewer resources and less waste. Which means the farmer can bring the fish to market with a lower price tag. Since fish is one of the most healthful foods in our diet, and there isn't enough of the wild kind to go around, this could be excellent news.The only snag? Its GM-ness. Which raises two questions, the first of which is whether it's safe to eat. According to the FDA, it is; on page 107 of their assessment, they say unequivocally, ""We looked for direct food consumption hazards. None were found."" The second question is whether the fish would be a threat to wild populations if it were to escape. Because the fish are raised in land-based pens, that question applies to a catastrophic failure of the holding facilities (which certainly could happen). Again, the FDA says the fish is safe.Lots of people take issue with these assessments, and I'm not going to try and hash through them here. Instead, I'm going to ask you one question: When you see a headline along the lines of, ""New Study Released on Safety of GM Fish,"" what do you hope for as you read the article?Do you hope it's the smoking gun, the last nail in the coffin of Frankenfish? Or do you hope, hope against hope, that we find out the fish is safe? Safe, so we can raise salmon with a fraction of the resources. Safe, so we can ease the pressure on our wild stocks. Safe, so families with tight food budgets can have salmon for supper.Genetic modification raises hard questions that need thorough answers. But, given finite resources to feed a growing population, wouldn't it be great if science could help us grow more nutritious foods with less time, effort, land, and money? I'm a farmer, and I say yes.I'm rooting for the fish."

We're out, having a couple of drinks, and before we know it we've had more to drink than we should have. We're drunk. What do you do at that point? Many people probably just keep drinking, because hey, you're having fun. But, if you for one reason or another you do not want to feel the effects of all the alcohol you've been consuming, the only thing you can count on is time. As in, you just have to wait for it to wear off. Or, you could try the Sober Shot. The Sober Shot is a 1/2-ounce drink that claims to, well, sober you up. It's made of honey, ginseng and seaweed extract, so it's all natural and safe to drink. While we're not really sure how those three ingredients could sober up an inebriated individual faster than a three-hour nap, the site claims that this is the first alcohol-metabolizer that actually works. Oh, and it's supposed to cure hangovers, too.You can try a shot for $9.95.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr.
