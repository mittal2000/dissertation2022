What is new, however, is that we now have the resources to get rid of it. Not too many years ago, Dr. Kirtley Mather, a Harvard geologist, wrote a book entitled Enough and to Spare. He set forth the basic theme that famine is wholly unnecessary in the modern world. Today, therefore, the question on the agenda must read: Why should there be hunger and privation in any land, in any city, at any table, when man has the resources and the scientific know-how to provide all mankind with the basic necessities of life?In January 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. took a very rare “sabbatical” at an isolated house in Jamaica far away from telephones and the constant pressures of his life as a very public civil rights leader to write what would become his last book: Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? The excerpt above could have been written yesterday. Professor Mather’s book arguing that mankind had achieved the ability to move beyond famine was published in 1944, yet in 2015, despite seventy more years of unparalleled advances in scientific and technological capability and global resources and wealth, hunger and want are still rampant – most shamefully in the United States with the world’s largest economy. Hear again Dr. King:There is no deficit in human resources; the deficit is in human will ... The well-off and the secure have too often become indifferent and oblivious to the poverty and deprivation in their midst. The poor in our countries have been shut out of our minds, and driven from the mainstream of our societies, because we have allowed them to become invisible. Ultimately a great nation is a compassionate nation. No individual or nation can be great if it does not have a concern for ‘the least of these.When Dr. King died in 1968 calling for a Poor People’s Campaign, there were 25.4 million poor Americans, including 11 million poor children. Today there are more than 45.3 million poor Americans, including 14.7 million poor children, living in our boastfully rich nation. The question is why we allow poverty still to exist, especially among our children who are the poorest age group of Americans, and the answer remains the same: the deficit in human will and genuine commitment to a fair playing field for all by a critical mass of leaders and citizens in our morally anemic nation. How can it be that the top one percent of Americans enjoy more of the nation’s wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined and that millions of children are hungry and homeless and poorly educated? If the qualification for individual and national greatness is genuine concern for the ""least of these"" as those of us who are Christians say we believe, and if nations and our concurrent role as members of nations and not just as individuals are accountable, then too many of our political, corporate, and faith leaders and citizens – all of us who live in America – are failing.The national holiday celebrating Dr. King’s birthday is over, but I hope we will heed and act on his 1967 declaration —“the time has come for an all-out world war against poverty”—and work to win the first victory right here at home in the biggest economy on earth and end the shame of 14.7 million children being the poorest Americans by ending child poverty now. Dr. King’s voice guides us if we are willing to hear and act on it and use it as a road map for action no matter the political weather. Reflecting on the direction the struggle for civil rights and social justice should take in Where Do We Go from Here?, he shared a story about the need to commit to difficult struggles for the long haul and described a nine and a half hour flight he had taken from New York to London in an older propeller airplane. On the way home, the crew announced the return flight from London to New York would take twelve and a half hours. When the pilot came out into the cabin, Dr. King asked him why. “‘You must understand about the winds,’ he said. ‘When we leave New York, a strong tail wind is in our favor, but when we return, a strong head wind is against us.’ But he added, ‘Don’t worry. These four engines are capable of battling the winds.’” Dr. King concluded: In any social revolution there are times when the tail winds of triumph and fulfillment favor us, and other times when strong head winds of disappointment and setbacks beat against us relentlessly. We must not permit adverse winds to overwhelm us as we journey across life’s mighty Atlantic; we must be sustained by our engines of courage in spite of the winds. This refusal to be stopped, this ‘courage to be,’ this determination to go on ‘in spite of’ is the hallmark of any great movement.As I ponder the miraculous progress sparked by ordinary citizens and people of grace and courage who risked limb and life to crumble the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of Jim Crow and unjust racial segregation in our land during the Civil Rights Movement, portrayed movingly in the film Selma which I hope every American, especially young people, will see, let it inspire us to put on new shoes of courage and will now to ensure that never again will our children and grandchildren have to fight those same battles as the forces of regression seek to turn our nation’s racial and social progress backwards. African American, Latino, Native American, and Asian American youths need to be taught our history and remember that they can never take anything for granted in America – especially now as racial profiling, intolerance, and poverty resurge over our land. Some are as blatant as the disproportionate killing of Black males at the hands of law enforcement personnel entrusted to protect life, huge racial disparities in school discipline policies against Black males and children with special needs, unequal educational offerings for poor children of color, and a mass incarceration system fueled by a Cradle to Prison Pipeline™ which feeds 1 in 3 Black and 1 in 6 Latino boys born in 2001 into prison. Incarceration has become the new American apartheid. Other forms of racism are more subtle, technical, and very polite. Although they may be wrapped up in new euphemisms and better etiquette, as Frederick Douglass warned, it’s still the same old snake. So, inspired by the movie Selma’s timely jogging of our collective memory about where we have come from against all odds, I hope a critical mass of citizens will rev up our engines of courage and will today and persistently and strategically combat the fierce head winds of poverty, racism, and education and economic inequality and greed that threaten to undo the progress of the last 50 years. Let’s stay true to the course Dr. King set for us and take up his last campaign to end poverty in America, beginning with our children, especially those of color, whose minds, bodies and spirits are being formed today. They cannot wait. Sign up to receive CDF’s groundbreaking new report on January 28, Ending Child Poverty Now, and learn about the concrete actions all of us urgently need to take."

""If you want someone you agree with 100 percent of the time, go home and look in the mirror,"" Christie said.One message that emerged on a day of speeches by about eight potential Republican candidates is that Bush and Romney have work to do to gain support from conservatives in the state, which will hold the first nominating contest of 2016 early next year.The view surfaced when Donald Trump, the brash New York developer, declared that a third run by Romney would not work because he ""choked"" as the losing 2012 Republican nominee.

Sometimes the effect is temporary, but not always, Dr. Zara Patel and colleagues at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia write in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.""Patients who suffer from decreased or total loss of smell, called 'hyposmia' or 'anosmia' are deeply affected by this problem,"" Patel told Reuters Health by email.""Compared to the other special senses, for example, loss of vision or hearing, the loss of smell is often thought of as relatively inconsequential, but this is far from the truth,"" Patel said.People who can't smell may lose important safety mechanisms, such as the ability to smell smoke or spoiled food, Patel said. And 80 percent of taste is linked to smell, so a total loss of smell could ruin a person's ability to enjoy food and beverages and have a negative effect on their social life.""This can (and often does) lead to deep depression and a drastic reduction in quality of life,"" Patel said, adding there is currently no established cure for the problem.Patel said hundreds of different respiratory viruses might have an effect like this, including some 200 viruses that cause the common cold. But the influenza virus may be preventable with vaccines.""I saw this as a potential opportunity to (look for) any association between rate of vaccination and rate of (olfactory) loss, and see if there's a way to eventually use this information,"" she said.Patel and colleagues identified 36 patients with olfactory problems that started after upper respiratory infections. The average duration of loss of smell was about 19 months but ranged from three to 48 months.They compared those patients to 38 patients of the same race, age and gender, but without olfactory problems.Overall, only 19 percent of the group with smell problems had been vaccinated against the flu, compared to 42 percent of the group who had no loss of smell.It's important to note this is a small study, and more research needs to be done, Patel cautioned.Now her team needs to look at this same subject with more rigorously designed studies, she said.Patel said viruses aren't the only cause of smell dysfunction - sinus disease, trauma and tumors are other potential causes.She said a few people will spontaneously recover their sense of smell after losing it, but this chance decreases as time passes from the first month after the loss.""If people realize they are not able to smell or taste as well as they used to, they should seek care from an otolaryngologist as soon as possible,"" Patel said. ""Because the longer the amount of time that passes before they are able to start treatment, the less chance they have for recovery.""SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1GwePSx JAMA Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, online January 15, 2015.

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e5643c000018010dfdad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee are gearing up to fight their new Republican chairman’s attempts to reclaim the panel’s report on the CIA’s torture program, setting the stage for a feud between the committee's majority and minority members less than three weeks into the new Congress.  “You can’t just come in here and rewrite history,” said a U.S. official familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of committee matters. “We’re not just going to roll over and let him do this.”  The official's comments came after reports earlier this week that committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) sent a letter to the executive branch earlier this month demanding that it return its copies of the classified 6,900-page torture report. In December, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), then the panel's chairwoman, had sent the full report to the White House for ""dissemination to all relevant agencies,” just before she turned the committee reins over to Burr.  In his request, Burr suggested that Feinstein had violated Senate Intelligence Committee protocols by sending out the full report. Most committee Democrats, with the exception of Feinstein, only became aware of Burr's Jan. 14 request after news reports of the letter emerged this week, the U.S. official said. When news of Burr's move finally surfaced, Democratic lawmakers made no secret of their outrage.Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said Wednesday that it would be “unprecedented and misguided” for the White House to return the copies. “There are lessons in the study for all executive branch agencies, and those lessons should be broadly shared,"" he said.  “It would be unprecedented and foolish to return the Executive Branch's classified copies of the report,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement earlier this week.   And it wasn’t just Democrats who were miffed.  “I just simply disagree,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Thursday. McCain, as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is now an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee. “We’re very close friends, we just have a disagreement,” he said of Burr.But the panel's new leader was unfazed by the controversy.  “If bipartisanship is them not informing us of what they’re doing, but we’re not bipartisan because we actually called them on it, then we’re going to get a new definition of bipartisanship,” Burr said of his Democratic colleagues in a Thursday interview with The Huffington Post. “I think it’s important that we get to this baseline point, and I think we’re going to do it by the book, versus what it looks like they did -- which was do it by the seat of their pants.”  In a related development, Burr said that he had referred the matter of Feinstein's disclosure to the Senate parliamentarian, the upper chamber's adviser on procedure and rules. Burr said his referral suggested that Feinstein may have violated the panel’s fiercely secretive rules by sending the full report to the executive branch without a vote by the intelligence committee.  “We’ve asked the parliamentarian to look at the hearing records from the committee to see if, in fact, our understanding of what transpired is correct … whether [Feinstein] had the authority to send it,” Burr told HuffPost. “I’ll let the parliamentarian determine whether, in fact, she followed the committee rules.”  The White House declined to comment on how it planned to respond to Burr’s request, or on whether it would comply by sending its copies of the full report back to Congress.Burr's letter to the White House said Feinstein had sent the classified torture report to the executive branch without consulting then-ranking member Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) or any members of the panel's minority. But Feinstein has challenged that notion, claiming that her disclosure was covered by the 112th Congress’ vote to complete the torture study, as well as a 2014 committee vote to release a redacted version of the study’s executive summary.The former chairwoman has also taken her case to the White House. In a Jan. 16 letter to President Barack Obama that was obtained by Vice News, Feinstein challenged her successor’s assertions, noting that all members of the Senate Intelligence Panel had had access to the ""transmittal letter"" accompanying the report copies that went to the White House. The transmittal letter, Feinstein suggests, should have served as notice that the disclosure had taken place.This new development in the years-long torture report feud comes less than three weeks after Burr took the helm of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Before taking over, the North Carolina Republican promised to shift focus to current emerging threats and move past the disagreements of the last year, many of which have centered on the controversial torture study.  Burr's first bold move, though, isn’t likely to inspire cooperation from his Democratic colleagues.  “It’s going to make it very difficult,” the U.S. official said. “Unprecedented … I can’t think of any precedent for it.”  Currently, the full, classified torture report is considered a “congressional record,” and thus is exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests. Preservation within executive branch record-keeping systems, though, would leave the full report subject to FOIA requests. In her letter to Obama, Feinstein requested that the White House retain its copies of the report “within appropriate Executive Branch Systems of Record.”   But if Burr’s attempts to recollect all copies are successful, he could seal the report's status as a congressional record and protect it from potential disclosure compelled under FOIA, at least for the duration of his tenure.   “[The report is] a committee sensitive document that should not leave the committee,” Burr said, though he wouldn’t clearly say whether the FOIA consideration was part of his decision to request the document back from the executive branch. By claiming the report as “committee sensitive,"" Burr suggests the document should be subject to the Senate committee's much stricter rules of disclosure.The new chairman on Thursday also dismissed reports that a third party -- like the CIA -– instructed him to fight to get the torture report back, calling such speculation “ludicrous.”  Burr also said this week that he intends to return to the CIA a controversial internal agency document that has been the center of a years-long feud between the CIA and Congress. Senate Intelligence Committee investigators working under Feinstein have fought for access to the document, which is known as the Panetta Review. The review supposedly aligns with the Senate study’s damning conclusions about the CIA's torture program, most of which the agency publicly denies.Wyden mentioned the explosive document in his statement expressing opposition for Burr's attempts to reclaim the larger torture report. “Senator Feinstein was smart to keep a copy of the Panetta Review,"" he said. ""I certainly don't think the Senate should allow the Panetta Review to be covered up by letting [CIA] Director [John] Brennan stick it in the shredder."" "

Steve King, R-Iowa, arrives for a closed-door meeting with fellow Republicans as the House of Representatives works into the night to pass a bill to fund the government, at the Capitol in Washington. The Republican Partyâs two Kings in Congress both voted against GOP leadersâ latest effort to prevent President Barack Obamaâs health care overhaul from becoming entrenched, but for opposite reasons. New York congressman Peter King says it was a mistake to link curbing âObamacareâ with averting a government shutdown.

Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e5662100005002c969fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Last August, two young undocumented immigrants approached Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) while they were eating lunch to ask whether the lawmakers thought they should be deported. King talked to them for seven minutes. Paul, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, took a few bites of his burger and left within 30 seconds, later saying he'd had to go do an interview.Expect a lot more interactions like that one between now and November 2016. Immigration advocates, including young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, are planning to challenge presidential candidates as much as possible over their stance on the issue. They aim to get the politicians to firmly state what they plan to do about the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. -- whether they would deport them, push for some type of immigration reform or strip away protections implemented by President Barack Obama.The effort will gather steam this weekend, when several potential Republican contenders go to Des Moines, Iowa, for the Freedom Summit, hosted by King and the group Citizens United. Among the speakers will be Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Dreamers and other immigration advocates will be there, too, they said Thursday in a press call hosted by the pro-immigration reform group America's Voice. They plan to hold press availabilities and will likely protest outside the event. They also hope to confront the politicians directly. ""We want to be there to have those conversations with them, to pose that question of 'Do you really believe we should be deported?'"" said Erika Andiola, co-director of DRM Action Coalition, an advocacy group, and one of the Dreamers who confronted King and Paul last year. They also want the prospective presidential candidates to speak out against King, one of the staunchest opponents of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress. The congressman infamously said some Dreamers have ""calves the size of cantaloupes"" from smuggling drugs across the border, and drafted legislation that would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which allows Dreamers to stay in the U.S. and work. Earlier this week, he referred to a 21-year-old student and DACA recipient as ""a deportable"" and criticized first lady Michelle Obama for bringing her as a guest to the State of the Union. Some potential candidates are skipping the King event this weekend. But Matt Hildreth, an Iowa-based America's Voice staffer, said on the press call that he would rather have them show up and voice support for immigration reform than stay away. ""Not having them go is sort of letting them off easy,"" he said. ""I don't think we want to give credit to candidates for not just going to a Steve King event ... but if they're going to go, they need to kind of take a stand.""A majority of Republicans oppose DACA, and most GOP members of Congress voted against comprehensive immigration reform. But the potential GOP presidential candidates have largely steered clear of specifics when asked what exactly should be done about the nation's undocumented immigrant population.This weekend and at future events, advocates are hoping to press politicians on whether they support immigration reform and whether they would continue Obama's policies, including DACA and deportation relief for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.On Thursday, the Iowa-based advocacy group CASA Sioux County ran an ad in The Des Moines Register that reads: ""Attention 2016 presidential candidates coming to Iowa: We are Iowa Republican, Democrat, and Independent voters and we sponsored the ad to tell you that we support immigration reform."" The ad also references a 2013 poll that found 77 percent of Iowans support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Immigration reform activists won't get the chance to talk to all of the Republicans considering a run in 2016 this weekend. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Paul will not attend the Freedom Summit. But Monica Reyes, cofounder of the group DREAM Iowa, said local Dreamers will be at their events if and when they do make it to Iowa. ""We're going to make sure these candidates are going to be confronted and asked these tough questions,"" Reyes said.Activists plan to challenge Democrats on their immigration stances in the coming months as well. Dreamer groups have already confronted potential 2016 presidential contender Hillary Clinton multiple times. "

""It does not put any pressure on the NLA's decision.""Yingluck is not due to appear at the NLA on Friday.ARMY CHIEF SAYS RESPECT DECISIONThe government of coup leader and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has urged Yingluck's supporters to stay out of Bangkok this week, although a repeat of the protests that have dogged the country in recent years is unlikely.Thailand remains under martial law, and authorities have been quick to stifle any public protest.In a radio broadcast on Friday, Thailand's Army Chief General Udomdej Sitabutr called on the population to respect the NLA's vote.Yingluck disputed the charges in an appearance at the NLA on Thursday and said the scheme boosted the economy.""Banning me for five years would be a violation of my basic rights,"" Yingluck said in an almost hour-long address to the NLA.""This case that is aimed solely against me has a hidden agenda, it is politically driven.""A decision to ban Yingluck from politics would require three-fifths of the NLA vote.The NLA was hand-picked by coup leader and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, and around 100 of the 220 members are former or currently serving military officers.Prayuth has said he has not he has not ordered the 220 members of the NLA to vote against Yingluck.The impeachment is the latest chapter in 10 years of turbulent politics that have pitted Yingluck and her brother Thaksin, himself a former prime minister, against the royalist-military establishment which sees the Shinawatras as a threat and reviles their populist policies.Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 coup and fled Thailand to avoid a 2008 jail term for corruption. He has lived abroad since, but retains a strong influence over Thai politics.Since the 2014 coup, Yingluck has had to inform the military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), of any travel plans.A political ban on Yingluck would have little immediate impact on party politics, as the NCPO has forbidden all parties from engaging in political activity since the coup.

My son, 15, and I watched Russell Wilson score a touchdown and get a two-point conversion to take the lead. But then Aaron Rodgers and Mason Crosby countered with a field goal only to have Wilson throw a game-winning touchdown in overtime for the Seahawks.Football is not just a game of strategy, but it is counterstrategy, execution, recovery, calibration, recalibration and then again strategy and execution -- all in 24-second cycles. So what makes this possible? We pondered, why is football so different from other team sports like soccer, baseball or basketball.We believe it has to do with one transformative activity, the huddle. Only in football, does a team, every 24 seconds, gather to plot their offensive attack. The offensive team has short-term goals, the first down line; the long term goal, the touchdown; and reach goals, a game-winning strategy. The defensive team prepares for the counter.The plotting is done in the huddle, in a brief five to ten seconds, with players looking each other in the eye and their leader, the quarterback, taking signals from the sideline, providing instructions and an execution plan. In the huddle there is no time for a conversation, deep reflection and discussion. Businesses too have taken on the concept of the huddle. Donavan Roberson, a business consultant, in his blog writes, ""The huddle is a key element ... that speaks to importance of the team by communicating vision, providing clarity and demonstrating unity.""Even hospitals have taken on the concept of the huddle. Since 2013, Advocate Health Care, one of the largest U.S. health systems, has banned 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. meetings, allowing time instead for 15-minute team huddles. This has allowed them to identify 40 percent more patient safety concerns. On the floor, nursing teams gather and discuss safety and quality issues that may have occurred in the past 24 hours and which may occur in the next 24. In the surgical suite there is no need for a huddle. The surgeon, the scrub nurse and the anesthesiologist are in a constant huddle over the operative field, with the patient draped underneath. So hospitals has adopted another sports strategy, the time out. In nearly every hospital in the country, a ""time out"" is taken immediately before starting the procedure to perform a final check to make sure that the correct patient is about to undergo the correct procedure, on the correct site. Studies have shown that a timeout reduces wrong-side surgeries and improves the communication among the surgeon, anesthesiologist, the scrub nurse and the assistants. The huddle is successful for many reasons. First and foremost it is direct personal human-to-human, eye-to-eye contact. It is a powerful way to unite a group of people. It is instructive with each team member knowing his or her role and how to follow through with it. And if one fails, he or she is held accountable by a face-to-face in the next huddle.Now, it's ironic, in football, how the ""no-huddle"" itself has become a new strategy, to catch the defense off guard and not allow them to plot a counter strategy. A plan decided in the preceding huddle by the offensive team.Let's see what strategies the Seahawks and Patriots come up with in the Super Bowl which is sure to be exciting as 100 million Americans look on, and see the power of the huddle.

The bill did not pass Congress with enough support to override the veto. Also of note, a series of important documentaries by Leslie Iwerks on the Canadian tar sands are now available through streaming service online. (I was interviewed for ""Pipe Dreams,"" which focuses on the Keystone pipeline). When Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) took over the reins of the Senate, he wasted little time in choosing the Keystone oil pipeline as the first item for the new Congress. He may be having buyer's remorse.McConnell's problem is that 70% of the public - including 56% of Republicans and 54% of conservatives - support actions to deal with climate change. That means more clean energy and less carbon pollution from sources such as highly polluting tar sands oil, which would flow through the Keystone pipeline. Momentum is building, and not long ago 400,000 Americans took to the streets of New York to demand action, engaging millions across the nation through social media. Debate Exposes GOP Rift on Climate  This past week, Senate Democrats began using the Keystone bill to expose the rift between Senate Republican leaders and the public on climate change. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) secured a rare consensus in the Senate this week when 98 Senators supported a statement that climate change was real and not a ""hoax."" Even Sen. Inhofe (R-OK), who literally wrote the book claiming climate change is a hoax, threw in the towel. It was a rare concession that his attacks on climate scientists have become a drag on others in the GOP.But acknowledging the climate is changing and that pollution is contributing to the warming are two different things, and Democrats continued to press. Voting on another amendment, 15 Republicans broke ranks with Inhofe and McConnell to affirm that ""human activities contribute to climate change."" The amendment, which was also supported by all Senate Democrats, cites the findings of respected scientific organizations, noting that warming is ""unequivocal,"" and highlighting the following warning: ""A warmer planet causes large-scale changes that reverberate throughout the climate system of the Earth, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns."" Supporters included Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL), who was loudly criticized earlier this month when he questioned whether pollution is impacting warming. The quick reversal underscores the conflict between Senators like Kirk, who are up for re-election in 2016, and the GOPs climate bubble inside the Beltway, where leadership has close ties with lobbying giants such as the American Petroleum Institute. Along with a strong showing of support for an amendment from Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to reduce energy use through better efficiency, these developments suggest a possible thawing in the rigidly partisan debates on climate change that marked the past Congress. They also reflect a growing recognition that voters from both parties want to conserve and protect the health of future generations. Public Support for Keystone PlummetsWhich brings us back to the Keystone pipeline, a project designed to carry tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf. McConnell selected Keystone, which is supported by some Senate Democrats, in order to showcase an ""open"" process of debate and amendments in the new Senate, the kind of ""serious legislating"" he said had been missing under Democratic leadership. Thursday, McConnell shut down that process, seeking an early exit to what was becoming an increasingly uncomfortable topic.How low has Keystone's political stock fallen? The pipeline has historically polled well, but that has begun to change. According to a new Washington Post-ABC poll on Keystone, just 34 percent of Americans say, 'Build it now.'  That's a sharp reversal from earlier Keystone polls. There is no reason to believe that Keystone's freefall will stop. To the relief of families across the nation, gas prices are plummeting. This strips supporters of a key, although purely symbolic, motivation for having the debate. Meanwhile, a new pipeline rupture has spilled 50,000 gallons of oil into the treasured Yellowstone River, and BP is drawing renewed attention to the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout as they fight fines in court. The changing political fortunes of Keystone were on display this week during the State of the Union, when President Obama prodded the GOP on the pipeline, a topic he has largely sought to avoid in the past. ""So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,"" he said. ""Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.""The GOP has scrambled to adjust their message. In the GOP response to the State of the Union, freshman Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) never mentioned that Keystone was a ""pipeline"" or an energy project at all. She called it the ""Keystone jobs bill."" This is a long way from when I testified at the first two congressional hearings on Keystone, when proponents made fanciful claims about solving America's energy independence and high gas prices. Congress Is Avoiding a Real Energy DebateThe public is right to yawn at the Senate Keystone spectacle. The president has promised to veto the bill and he has the votes to back him up. The American Petroleum Institute recently compared the Keystone pipeline to a centuries-old art masterpiece: the Mona Lisa. It is an absurd comparison that only oil lobbyists could conceive of, but one thing rings true: Keystone is a project firmly rooted in the past, just like our outdated national energy policies. Congress should be doing everything it can to make affordable clean energy technologies more widely available, which would create far more jobs than Keystone, protect our climate for our kids' future, clean the air we breathe, and improve America's energy security. Instead of looking to the past on energy, it's time for Congress to work on the energy future Americans want and future generations deserve.(Note: Date references and hyperlinks updated Jan. 24)"
