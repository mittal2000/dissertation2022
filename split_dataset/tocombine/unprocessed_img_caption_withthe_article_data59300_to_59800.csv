The United States Football League, ""USFL"", was an aspiring competitor to the establishment NFL (National Football League) in the early 1980's. The USFL was already making an imprint by being different, from the individualism it inspired with fans in the stands to liberating the game from some rules. It was success compared to most revolutions which are extinguished in the phase from imagination to realization. And, then came Donald Trump...Ambition and self-promotion, like so many late comers to the cause, Trump was more vocal against the establishment but in the end more fatal to his fellow rebels, and the revolution. The USFL for him was not big enough, or, more accurately, for his ambition. He had milked the USFL cameras to focus on him even as much or more than on the players, coaches and cheerleaders, the soldiers on the field. Trump Sues and Wins but USFL Loses:  Trump had bought the New Jersey Generals USFL franchise, which also had the best player in all of football, NFL or USFL, Herschel Walker. Trump perhaps sought Walker's limelight or maybe in his own mind he was the bigger star. Trump soon forced the USFL to make some fatal moves, while promising that a legal suit against the establishment NFL would deliver greater riches for all -- Trump back then also threatened and did duel with his lawyers as bullets all the time. The anti-monopoly lawsuit against the NFL did prevail. However, the jury awarded only $1 of damages to the USFL, in part citing Trump for self-inflicted wounds to the USFL. Unfortunately though, the USFL never recovered from this deepest cut. The new league had provided jobs for thousands who worked behind the scenes and fought in the pits, including one of my former teammates at Tulane University, Chuck Pitcock, Jr., a starting offensive lineman. In the end, his and the dreams of many others were cut short, extinguished by the judgment as well as greed of Donald Trump.Chuck Pitcock had played for an USFL team called the Tampa Bay Bandits, which was partially owned by Burt Reynolds. Besides being a star of such popular films as Smokey & the Bandit, Boogie Nights (also produced by another Tulane alumni Lawrence Gordon and one of my favorites) and The Longest Yard, the original and best, Burt Reynolds also played college football. The Bandits majority owner John Basset sought to stand up to what he perceived as Donald Trump's vision and plans for the USFL as being both dangerous and inconsistent with the USFL's foundation. However, eventually Basset succumbed to a battle with cancer and Trump's promises to the other USFL team owners who bought into the Donald's story. After winning his case, Trump left the $3.00 check (damages are trebled in anti-trust cases) to the owners, and then he unceremoniously abandoned them and the USFL.   Trump wants to Lead the Rebellion but he Betrayed the Revolution with Ambition to be the EstablishmentIf you cannot yet see through what a Trump Presidency would mean for the U.S., then just look three decades back to Trump taking control of the USFL. Trump tells the cameras in the ESPN documentary, Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL, that perhaps rather than buying into the USFL, he should have bought into the established NFL, (National Football League.) Guess they would not have him or he could not buy them, so Trump sought to buy into and then dictate to the rebellion in the form of the USFL. In the end, Trump failed the revolution and those who trusted and supported him. He then quickly moved on leaving the victims of his ambition with the epithet as ""small potatoes."" I love football, American football, played it, had it pay for my college via scholarship and would have played beyond, if I only had the exceptional talent required in the NFL, or USFL. Aspiring to be a pro or even college football player requires not only talent but also a commitment and respect for your fellow teammates. ""Pitcock,"" as we called him because the name fit a character on and off the field, was a ""good ole boy"" from Florida on a team of diverse personalities. Some on the team were perhaps more inclined to braggadocio while others exuded a quiet confidence. We all had the privilege to share the locker room on a team that was regularly rated among the top 20 of US college teams, had achieved some memorable victories, (including over our arch rival and perennial power LSU), and many of whose members went on to become medical doctors and as many professional football players. Part of Tulane's resurgence and then success was the new openness to diversity -- we were among the first teams to recruit African-American football players. Success at a team and individual level had generally more than a pinch of ego, but all of that and braggadocio had to be left at the door of the locker room. Narcissism would not be tolerated regardless of how great a talent you were and empty rhetoric would soon be exposed, by opponents and your own team.Confusing Braggadocio with Promise?Trump never played my game or shared the locker room with my teammates. I still love football and America, decades after having arrived to the U.S. as an young immigrant and becoming one of that team. Football has taught me how to be both a teammate and a fellow citizen. (Read: ""Growing up a 'Patriot'"".) President Bill Clinton in his book, My Life, speaks glowingly of my role as a football player. In respect to my former teammates and to maintain the mutual respect of that locker room, I always point out that my success though was more modest than Bill's credits. However, the lessons learned, the respect developed for individualism and diversity and the idea of my ego having to be fit into a team goal have made my American experience possible, and more. Trump has had numerous bites at the apple, and his American dream has been resurrected on more than one occasion -- but then enough money can allow you to leave football leagues, hotels, casinos and Trump University in the junk yard of memories. Fortunately in 2009, a former associate of Trump and USFL filmmaker Mike Tolin produced ""Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL"" well before Donald initiated upon another self-promotion engagement as US Presidential candidate. (Watch Dailymotion video: ""30 for 30 - Who Killed the USFL"") My old teammate ""Pitcock"" plays a starring role along with Burt Reynolds and countless former Trump foes and associates who give America a glimpse of what to expect from one who knows no team but demands absolute loyalty and obedience. Trumps wants to be the General, until he jumps off.

The United States Football League, ""USFL"", was an aspiring competitor to the establishment NFL (National Football League) in the early 1980's. The USFL was already making an imprint by being different, from the individualism it inspired with fans in the stands to liberating the game from some rules. It was success compared to most revolutions which are extinguished in the phase from imagination to realization. And, then came Donald Trump...Ambition and self-promotion, like so many late comers to the cause, Trump was more vocal against the establishment but in the end more fatal to his fellow rebels, and the revolution. The USFL for him was not big enough, or, more accurately, for his ambition. He had milked the USFL cameras to focus on him even as much or more than on the players, coaches and cheerleaders, the soldiers on the field. Trump Sues and Wins but USFL Loses:  Trump had bought the New Jersey Generals USFL franchise, which also had the best player in all of football, NFL or USFL, Herschel Walker. Trump perhaps sought Walker's limelight or maybe in his own mind he was the bigger star. Trump soon forced the USFL to make some fatal moves, while promising that a legal suit against the establishment NFL would deliver greater riches for all -- Trump back then also threatened and did duel with his lawyers as bullets all the time. The anti-monopoly lawsuit against the NFL did prevail. However, the jury awarded only $1 of damages to the USFL, in part citing Trump for self-inflicted wounds to the USFL. Unfortunately though, the USFL never recovered from this deepest cut. The new league had provided jobs for thousands who worked behind the scenes and fought in the pits, including one of my former teammates at Tulane University, Chuck Pitcock, Jr., a starting offensive lineman. In the end, his and the dreams of many others were cut short, extinguished by the judgment as well as greed of Donald Trump.Chuck Pitcock had played for an USFL team called the Tampa Bay Bandits, which was partially owned by Burt Reynolds. Besides being a star of such popular films as Smokey & the Bandit, Boogie Nights (also produced by another Tulane alumni Lawrence Gordon and one of my favorites) and The Longest Yard, the original and best, Burt Reynolds also played college football. The Bandits majority owner John Basset sought to stand up to what he perceived as Donald Trump's vision and plans for the USFL as being both dangerous and inconsistent with the USFL's foundation. However, eventually Basset succumbed to a battle with cancer and Trump's promises to the other USFL team owners who bought into the Donald's story. After winning his case, Trump left the $3.00 check (damages are trebled in anti-trust cases) to the owners, and then he unceremoniously abandoned them and the USFL.   Trump wants to Lead the Rebellion but he Betrayed the Revolution with Ambition to be the EstablishmentIf you cannot yet see through what a Trump Presidency would mean for the U.S., then just look three decades back to Trump taking control of the USFL. Trump tells the cameras in the ESPN documentary, Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL, that perhaps rather than buying into the USFL, he should have bought into the established NFL, (National Football League.) Guess they would not have him or he could not buy them, so Trump sought to buy into and then dictate to the rebellion in the form of the USFL. In the end, Trump failed the revolution and those who trusted and supported him. He then quickly moved on leaving the victims of his ambition with the epithet as ""small potatoes."" I love football, American football, played it, had it pay for my college via scholarship and would have played beyond, if I only had the exceptional talent required in the NFL, or USFL. Aspiring to be a pro or even college football player requires not only talent but also a commitment and respect for your fellow teammates. ""Pitcock,"" as we called him because the name fit a character on and off the field, was a ""good ole boy"" from Florida on a team of diverse personalities. Some on the team were perhaps more inclined to braggadocio while others exuded a quiet confidence. We all had the privilege to share the locker room on a team that was regularly rated among the top 20 of US college teams, had achieved some memorable victories, (including over our arch rival and perennial power LSU), and many of whose members went on to become medical doctors and as many professional football players. Part of Tulane's resurgence and then success was the new openness to diversity -- we were among the first teams to recruit African-American football players. Success at a team and individual level had generally more than a pinch of ego, but all of that and braggadocio had to be left at the door of the locker room. Narcissism would not be tolerated regardless of how great a talent you were and empty rhetoric would soon be exposed, by opponents and your own team.Confusing Braggadocio with Promise?Trump never played my game or shared the locker room with my teammates. I still love football and America, decades after having arrived to the U.S. as an young immigrant and becoming one of that team. Football has taught me how to be both a teammate and a fellow citizen. (Read: ""Growing up a 'Patriot'"".) President Bill Clinton in his book, My Life, speaks glowingly of my role as a football player. In respect to my former teammates and to maintain the mutual respect of that locker room, I always point out that my success though was more modest than Bill's credits. However, the lessons learned, the respect developed for individualism and diversity and the idea of my ego having to be fit into a team goal have made my American experience possible, and more. Trump has had numerous bites at the apple, and his American dream has been resurrected on more than one occasion -- but then enough money can allow you to leave football leagues, hotels, casinos and Trump University in the junk yard of memories.

8,EDUCATION,How the Teacher Shortage Could Turn Into a Crisis,"Randi Weingarten, ContributorPresident, American Federation of Teachers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-teacher-shortage_b_9712286.html,"The last 15 years have been marked by top-down education policies that promoted testing over teaching, competition over collaboration, austerity over investment, and scapegoating teachers rather than valuing them.

Atwell decried the unrelenting focus on standardized tests, which she said reduces teachers to ""mere technicians."" But she could have cited any number of factors that demoralize many teachers currently in the profession and increasingly dissuade people from considering teaching.Americans get it. A poll released this week by TeachStrong, a coalition aimed at elevating the teaching profession, found that nearly three-quarters of Americans believe teachers are profoundly undervalued in terms of how they are treated and supported. Respondents were nearly unanimous in their belief that changes and improvements are needed in the way we treat teachers. Randi Weingarten at Roosevelt MS, San FranciscoWeingarten visits Roosevelt Middle School in San Francisco. Photo by Russ Curtis.  Lawmakers and other authorities should take note, because we are staring down a crisis in the education profession. Enrollment in teacher preparation programs has declined sharply in recent years. And we lose an alarming number of teachers once they enter the profession-- between 40 and 50 percent of new teachers leave within five years. Add to that the loss of mid- and late-career teachers, who have honed their skills but can't see staying until retirement, and you've got a teacher brain-drain unseen in any other profession.The last 15 years have been marked by top-down education policies that promoted testing over teaching, competition over collaboration, austerity over investment, and scapegoating teachers rather than valuing them. The Every Student Succeeds Act, the new federal education law, moves us in the right direction, but past policies have left their mark.Teachers are under attack, and so is their latitude to do their jobs. They must fight as hard for the tools and conditions they and their students need as for any increase in salary. Educators routinely spend thousands out of pocket for classroom supplies, and even food and clothing for their students. Yet anti-public education and anti-teacher ideologues have backed lawsuits aiming to strip teachers of tenure and other workplace rights. But Vergara v. California, the case they hoped would do just that--and cascade to other states -- was struck down just days ago in a unanimous decision by a California appeals court.Teachers are the first to say that, if someone can't teach after they've been prepared and supported, they shouldn't be in our profession. Tenure ensures teachers have a voice and a fair disciplinary process -- not a job for life. It should never be a cloak for incompetence or an excuse for managers not to manage.And that is essentially what the court in Vergara said: that tenure as a concept does not adversely affect children's education. And while the court recognized the many factors including poverty that affect student learning, it also concluded that administrators have to manage fairly and effectively. The lead attorney who argued the Vergara case said in the wake of the ruling that ""the laws at issue in this case shackle school districts and impose severe and irreparable harm on students."" But that Orwellian premise -- that stripping teachers of employment rights enhances students' educational rights -- makes no sense and is thankfully continuing to lose support. What really harms students are social inequities that fail to provide disadvantaged children with the programs and services they need. Those who point fingers at teachers without ever lending them a hand seem hell-bent on turning America's teacher shortage into a full-blown crisis.You cannot fire your way to educational success. A great teaching force has to be nurtured -- and that happens by effectively recruiting, mentoring, evaluating, supporting and retaining teachers. So what can we do? We often look to high-achieving countries for lessons about how they educate their students. We should also look to them for how they treat their educators. They place a heavy emphasis on teacher preparation, mentoring and collaboration. Their teachers have voice and agency to meet children's needs. Simply put, these countries don't out-test us, but they do out-prepare, out-invest, out-respect and, as a result, outperform the United States.In this country, studies show that the features distinguishing struggling schools from schools that are improving academically include a focus on collaboration, professional development, and trust among teachers and administrators. Research shows that favorable working conditions predict improved academic growth, even in schools serving low-income, high-minority student populations. And schools with high levels of teacher voice have lower teacher turnover. Teachers should have the time, tools and trust they need to be most effective. They deserve to work in respectful, supportive environments. And teacher compensation should reflect the importance of their work.It's well past time that when someone says they are a teacher, the response is ""thank you,"" not ""why?"""

Enver Pasha, the Ottoman Minister for War, focused on inciting rebellion among the Muslim subjects of the British Empire. Berlin, on the other hand, tried to use Irish and Indian nationalists in a similar way. Germany also attempted to use a variation of this strategy to try to incite a war between Mexico and the United States, as well as to recruit German-Americans to fight on Germany's behalf. That gambit would backfire disastrously when its disclosure in the Zimmerman telegram paved the way for the American intervention into World War I on behalf of the Allies. Within days of the start of World War I, Irish nationalists reached out to Germany for support in their struggle for Irish Independence. In early August of 1914, Sir Roger Casement, a former British diplomat of Irish extraction, and John Devoy, the head of the nationalist Clan na Gael, met in New York with Germany's Ambassador to the United States, Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff. At the meeting the Irish nationalists proposed to organize an Irish revolt against Great Britain if Germany would sell guns to the Irish revolutionaries and provide officers to organize and train an Irish military force. On September 13, 1914, in Washington DC, Casement met with Franz von Papen, the German military attaché, to again seek Germany's support. At that meeting, Casement suggested that an Irish Brigade be organized from among the Irish prisoners of war from the British Army that had been captured by the Central Powers. The Brigade, he proposed, would fight alongside German troops against Great Britain and the Allies.A month later, in October 1914, Casement, styling himself an Ambassador of the Irish nation, traveled to Germany, via Norway, to meet with officials in the German government. On December 27, 1914, in Berlin, Casement signed an agreement with German Secretary of State Arthur Zimmermann formally authorizing the creation of the Irish Brigade. The German government subsequently issued a declaration supporting Irish independence and hinting they might land an army in Ireland, someday, to advance the cause of Irish sovereignty. The Brigade would be trained by the Germans and were to receive their own uniforms. Eventually, they would be made available to return to Ireland to fight against the British there. An Irish Brigade was in fact ultimately organized. Only 56 Irish POWs, out of the approximately 2,000 then being held in Germany, volunteered, however--far less than the usual 3,000-man strength of a brigade sized force. The men were sent to a POW camp in Limburg for training and eventually attached to the 203rd Brandenburg Regiment.  Roger Casement and John DevoyBy the time of the Easter Rebellion in April 1916, however, the Irish Brigade had been dissolved. There is some evidence that Casement also had some involvement in a similar effort to recruit and organize an Indian brigade from among Hindu POWs held by the Germans. Dubbed the Hindu-German conspiracy, it sought German assistance to win Indian independence. With the ongoing Battle of Verdun in full swing and Britain preparing for a new offensive on the Somme, Irish nationalists decided to organize a rebellion against British rule. Roger Casement traveled to Berlin to once again try to obtain German support for the planned uprising. He asked for 40,000 rifles to arm the Irish nationalists, as well as German officers to train them. He also sought to obtain a promise of a German landing on Ireland's west coast to support the rebels. The Germans did subsequently offer 20,000 Russian 1891M Mosin-Nagant rifles. The rifles were standard equipment for the Russian infantry, and had been captured by German forces on the Eastern Front. Berlin, however, declined to send officers to train the Irish nationalists or to land German troops in Ireland. Germany also offered ten machine guns, as well as ammunition. British code breakers had intercepted German communications from Washington DC discussing the shipment and were aware of its impending arrival. The ship transporting the weapons was a German merchant ship disguised as a Norwegian freighter, and was intercepted by the HMS Bluebell, an Acacia Class Sloop in the Royal Navy, on Friday, April 21 (Good Friday). While being escorted to Queenstown (today's Cobh) in County Cork, its Captain, Karl Spindler, scuttled the German freighter. Disillusioned by the failure of Berlin to deliver the promised support, Casement ended his discussions and returned to Ireland by German submarine ostensibly to call off the rebellion. Historians have since hotly debated the issue of how much Roger Casement knew of the proposed rebellion. Some have claimed that Casement was only dimly aware of the proposed uprising and that his journey to Berlin to seek German aid was a precondition to the rebellion going forward.  Damage in central Dublin viewed from the O'Connell BridgeOthers have argued that the date for the rebellion had already been set in anticipation of the promised German support and that Casement was aware of the proposed date and his hasty return to Ireland was prompted by his desire to call off the uprising when the promised German support failed to materialize. Casement arrived in Ireland in the early hours of April 21, and was captured later that day. Charged with treason, sabotage and espionage, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting trial. He was subsequently found guilty and hanged at Pentonville Prison in London on August 3, 1916.The British government was well aware of Casement's attempts to seek German support for a planned Irish rebellion. The British garrison in Dublin, however, believed it had Irish nationalism in check. To the surprise of both the British, and many Irish nationalists, rebellion erupted on April 24--Easter Monday--1916. Organized by members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and with the support of several other republican groups, approximately 1,250 rebels seized public buildings in the center of Dublin, including the General Post Office. Irish nationalists in Dublin quickly proclaimed a Free Irish Republic.London was infuriated over the rebellion at such a critical time in the war, and particularly since Ireland had been promised home rule once the conflict was over. The rebellion lasted six days before it was extinguished. More than 300 Irish nationalists had been slain and over 100 British troops killed. Initially there was resentment in Dublin against the rebels due to the damage caused and the civilian casualties caught in the crossfire. This changed, however, with the ensuing court-martials.  Irish detainees from the Easter RebellionPopular belief, which was untrue, was that Sinn Fein, a separatist organization that was at the time neither militant nor republican, was behind the uprising. Sixteen of the rebels were executed. The most prominent leader to escape execution was Éamon de Valera, commandant of the rebel's 3rd Battalion and a future president of Ireland. He was saved, in part, because of his American birth. Over 1,400 of the rebels were shipped across the Irish Sea and interned in England and Wales. Casement's remains were eventually repatriated, after numerous requests, to the Irish Republic in 1965. His body laid in state at Arbour Hill for five days. Approximately half a million people filed past his coffin. He received a state funeral attended by over 30,000 people and was buried with full military honors. Among those present was the 81 year old Eamon de Valera, President of the Republic and the last surviving leader of the Irish rebellion. He attended the funeral despite his doctor's orders not to."

It was never much of a ceasefire, so the issue might be purely a semantic one. Nonetheless, it underscores the continuing difficulties in crafting a political solution to end the five year long Syrian Civil War and its consequences.The current ceasefire went into effect on February 27, as part of a United Nations brokered effort that would have led to elections in early 2017, and a transition to a freely elected representative government. The ceasefire was the culmination of an ongoing effort spearheaded primarily by Russia and the United States, as well as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which had started in 2011 as an Arab-League and, from 2012 on, a joint Arab League-United Nations effort to end the fighting. That effort took on even more urgency following the escalation of fighting that followed the intervention of Russian military forces in support of the Assad government and the rising tide of Syrian refugees attempting to enter Europe. The ceasefire had specifically excluded ongoing military operations against Islamic State (IS) militants and the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusra Front. The ceasefire did result in a reduction in fighting in a number of the theaters of the Syrian Civil War, principally in the south. The ongoing Syrian Army campaign to retake Aleppo, however, continued unabated. Moreover, while Islamic State militants generally operated within a discreet area, al-Nusra militants were often co-located with other rebel groups, including the U.S. backed, Free Syrian Army, and on occasion would even collaborate with them in joint military operations against both Islamic State militants and Syrian government forces.From the very beginning of the Russian military intervention in September 2015, it was clear that the bulk of the Russian airstrikes were being directed at the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and other ""moderate groups.""

Grey: Islamic State It was equally clear that the Russian intent was to eliminate any Western-backed alternatives to the government of Bashar al-Assad as a viable option and force the United States and its allies to choose between either accepting a continuation of the Assad regime or allow Syria to come under the control of radical jihadist groups like Islamic State or the al-Nusra Front.With the tide of battle now shifted strongly in favor of Syrian military forces and both the Free Syrian Army and Islamic State on the defensive, Damascus has made it clear that Bashar al-Assad has no intention of stepping down and that the only viable ""political solution"" would be some kind of ""national unity government"" under Assad that would incorporate the more moderate elements of the anti-Assad opposition and which, with Russian and U.S. support, would continue military operations against Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front.The Free Syrian Army has rejected its participation in any unity government that includes Assad but has indicated it would accept members of his inner circle provided they were not guily of any ""war crimes"".What is risking the complete collapse of the ceasefire, however, is the Syrian Army's ongoing operations to retake Aleppo. Those operations had never stopped, even under the ceasefire. Syrian military forces are now on the verge of surrounding Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and a key stronghold of the Free Syrian Army, and also various jihadist groups including the al-Nusra Front. The prospect of retaking control of the city is simply too tempting for Damascus to pass up. Moreover, the political situation has changed significantly in the past six weeks. What prompted Russian calls for a ceasefire was the Kremlin's concern of an imminent Turkish intervention into the civil war. Although Ankara has been a vehement opponent of the Assad regime, its more immediate concern was to prevent the creation of a semi-autonomous Kurdish state along the Syrian-Turkish border. That proposed state, Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan, made up of the cantons of Jazira, Kobani and Afrin, was rapidly taking shape as the largely Kurdish, Syrian Democratic Forces militia advanced west of the Euphrates in an attempt to link up with the Kurdish forces in Afrin Canton to the west. A successful link up would create a continuous Kurdish controlled zone in Syria from the Iraqi border almost all the way to the Mediterranean. Such a semi-autonomous state was deeply concerning to Ankara, as it would prompt renewed demands of its own Kurdish community for more political autonomy.In the weeks prior to the ceasefire taking effect, there were numerous signs that Turkey was actively considering a military intervention to secure the largely Islamic State controlled zone between Afrin Canton and the Euphrates. Ostensibly the intervention would be justified as an attempt to create a safe zone for Syrian refugees displaced by the fighting elsewhere in Syria. The Turkish military even went so far as to begin dismantling Turkish minefields along the border to prepare invasion routes into Syria. A Turkish invasion, while it would likely have resulted in the quick occupation of the disputed territory, was not without its problems. Such an intervention was highly unpopular in Turkey. It would have likely promoted an increase in IS inspired terrorist attacks in Turkey. Moreover, there was the more significant problem of who would provide air cover. Having shot down a Russian SU-24 jet fighter on November 24, for straying into Turkish air space, it was a foregone conclusion that the appearance of Turkish Air Force planes over Syria would have prompted a Russian retaliatory response. The downing of Turkish Air Force jets, to further complicate the situation, might have prompted Ankara to seek NATO support under Article 5 of the mutual defense treaty. Russian SU-25s landing at the Latakia air base in SyriaAnkara had extensive discussions with Washington over the prospect of the U.S. supplying air cover and, according to unconfirmed reports, an agreement in principal was reached, although the Obama White House has continued to insist no such agreement was made. It's very possible that Russia's repeated and deliberate provocation of Turkey in November 2015, was intended to complicate a possible Turkish intervention and make the consequences of an intervention much more problematic for Turkey the United States and for the NATO alliance in general. The prospect of American air support for a Turkish ground invasion triggered Russian announcements that a Turkish invasion would quickly escalate, ""draw other countries into the conflict,"" and even a declaration by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that it ""could possibly lead to a third World War""--shorthand for a direct U.S.-Russian military clash. The Obama White House's strong support for the Russian ceasefire proposal was likely prompted by a desire to avoid the complications that would have been created by a Turkish intervention.A Turkish intervention is still possible, but seems less likely now than it did six weeks ago. Washington has been quietly backing away from supplying air cover to Turkish Forces. The success of the Kurdish led Syrian Democratic Forces against Islamic State, as well as Russian overtures in support of the SDF, and more generally in favor of more autonomy for Syrian Kurds, has meant that the last thing that the Obama administration wants is a direct military clash between Turkey and the U.S. backed SDF or the prospect of having to choose between supporting one side or the other.From the Kremlin's standpoint the ""Syrian ceasefire"" served the political purpose it was designed to achieve¬--it forestalled a Turkish ground invasion of Syria. For the Obama White House it is yet one more example of how it continues to be out maneuvered in Syria by Vladimir Putin. For the moment, the military operation to retake Aleppo goes on, Bashar al-Assad shows no signs of stepping down and the Syrian Civil War will continue unabated."

It was never much of a ceasefire, so the issue might be purely a semantic one. Nonetheless, it underscores the continuing difficulties in crafting a political solution to end the five year long Syrian Civil War and its consequences.The current ceasefire went into effect on February 27, as part of a United Nations brokered effort that would have led to elections in early 2017, and a transition to a freely elected representative government. The ceasefire was the culmination of an ongoing effort spearheaded primarily by Russia and the United States, as well as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which had started in 2011 as an Arab-League and, from 2012 on, a joint Arab League-United Nations effort to end the fighting. That effort took on even more urgency following the escalation of fighting that followed the intervention of Russian military forces in support of the Assad government and the rising tide of Syrian refugees attempting to enter Europe. The ceasefire had specifically excluded ongoing military operations against Islamic State (IS) militants and the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusra Front. The ceasefire did result in a reduction in fighting in a number of the theaters of the Syrian Civil War, principally in the south. The ongoing Syrian Army campaign to retake Aleppo, however, continued unabated. Moreover, while Islamic State militants generally operated within a discreet area, al-Nusra militants were often co-located with other rebel groups, including the U.S. backed, Free Syrian Army, and on occasion would even collaborate with them in joint military operations against both Islamic State militants and Syrian government forces.From the very beginning of the Russian military intervention in September 2015, it was clear that the bulk of the Russian airstrikes were being directed at the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and other ""moderate groups."" The Russian intervention had been prompted by the need to stabilize the client Assad government in Damascus, then getting dangerously close to losing key territory to the Free Syrian Army.

While Sanders is still behind in the delegate count with Hillary Clinton, he has energized many young and liberal voters around the country. New York holds its primary this Tuesday. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb93a651f00000002259161.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"1,299 to 1,105.That's the ""insurmountable"" delegate lead Hillary Clinton has over Bernie Sanders.And there are still 1,674 pledged delegates yet to be awarded in twenty primaries and caucuses to be held over the next two months; scores of up-for-grabs delegates yet to be decided via state and county Democratic conventions; and hundreds and hundreds of super-delegates to be wooed by both candidates in Philadelphia this summer -- with not a single one of them having officially committed themselves to anybody.That's the cold, hard truth -- the indisputable numeric data of the current election cycle -- but it's not the story Americans are being told.Why?Well, put it this way: say what you will about Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight.com -- for instance, that its projections for Bernie Sanders in primaries and caucuses have routinely been low, a fact which sits uncomfortably beside its penchant for publishing articles marginalizing Sanders and his supporters as quixotic -- but they've consistently had the most accurate delegate counts for the Democratic Primary race.And even they can't keep up with Sanders.In just the past week, Sanders has cut Clinton's delegate lead by 20 -- by 12 in Colorado (Sanders +6, Clinton -6) and by four each in Nevada and Missouri (Sanders +2, Clinton -2) -- without a single statewide primary or caucus being held, and even Nate Silver and his crew haven't been able to amend their usually accurate delegate tallies fast enough. That's understandable; it's easy to fall behind in reporting on a candidate who's beaten Hillary Clinton eight Election Days in a row -- President Obama having never lost more than two in a row in 2008 -- when you also have to publish esoterically misleading stories like ""Clinton Is Winning the States That Look Like the Democratic Party"" and ""Bernie Sanders Is Even Less Competitive Than He Appears"". Sanders supporters understand: burying a candidate is hard work.But on the assumption Silver, who's actually a pollster and not an editorialist, will get back to doing what he's known for, he'll notice that not only is Sanders way ahead of Clinton in favorability polling, head-to-head national polling against GOP candidates, head-to-head battleground-state polling against GOP candidates, and also, in many of the recent national polls, head-to-head polling against Clinton herself, but he's also cutting into her pledged delegate lead near-daily without having to lift a finger.So it bears repeating: after recent second- and third-stage successes in Missouri, Nevada, and Colorado -- that is, after continuing to compete in the second and third stages of delegate selection in these three states, in a way both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have either declined or been unable to do -- Sanders has gained 20 net delegates on his Democratic opponent in just the last week, only a fraction of which are reflected in the current delegate count at FiveThirtyEight.com.This comes after gaining four net delegates in Arizona the week before that.This means that Clinton's delegate lead has dropped by 24 in just the last two weeks, and in events barely covered by the media in four of the nation's fifty states. If similar events were to occur at even a handful of the other 46 state party conventions, Clinton's lead, even outside any remaining primaries and caucuses, could be greatly imperiled.Seems newsworthy, doesn't it? Cutting 24 delegates off Clinton's 200-plus delegate lead in just four states and 14 days, with two months left in the primary season, twenty primaries and caucuses left, and many states that have already held primaries and caucuses still planning to hold precisely the sort of county conventions that have already netted Sanders so many new delegates in so little time?Apparently not.So what's that new delegate count again? 1,299 to 1,105.That's right: with 1,674 delegates left to be awarded, and possibly dozens of delegates left to be ""re-awarded"" following county- and state-level Democratic conventions across the nation, Clinton's delegate lead -- so insurmountable it's really only spoken of these days in euphemistic superlatives -- is no more than 1,299 to 1,105.To put it in perspective, given the number of total pledged delegates on the Republican side (2,474) as compared to the Democratic side (4,051), Clinton's lead on Sanders is the equivalent of Donald Trump having a 118-delegate lead on Ted Cruz.Trump's actual current lead over Cruz? Not 118, but nearly twice that -- 215.So why are most American news-watchers under the distinct impression that Ted Cruz has a much better chance of catching Trump in pledged delegates than Sanders does of catching Clinton?I don't know -- ask Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight.com.Or ask any of the other major mainstream-media institutions, who, instead of reporting that Clinton leads Sanders by only 194 delegates, have done the Secretary the enormous favor of making it look like she leads by 25 percent more than that -- having already done her the favor of reporting misleading super-delegate tallies for months, thereby falsely inflating Clinton's lead by hundreds of unpledged delegates.Here's how big a favor the media is presently doing Mrs. Clinton -- who, again, leads Senator Sanders by just 194 delegates:False Delegate Counts, By Media Institution(from most inaccurate delegate count to least inaccurate count)CBS: 695 * Politico: 672 * NBC: 664 * ABC: 244 Fox News: 244 RealClearPolitics: 244 CNN: 229 New York Times: 220 FiveThirtyEight: 206* Network falsely includes super-delegates in delegate count, against the express demand of the Democratic National Committee.So, as New York residents prepare to head to the polls on Tuesday, with many of them -- particularly Sanders supporters -- wondering how much of a difference their vote can really make, the answer is: a very, very great deal. For as we've already seen over the past two weeks, delegate leads can evaporate far faster than the even the media intelligentsia can track. The actual delegate count is 1,299 to 1,105 today, but who knows what it'll be by mid-week, if Sanders supporters ignore the mainstream media's computational disabilities and turn out to vote?Seth Abramson is the Series Editor for Best American Experimental Writing (Wesleyan University) and the author, most recently, of DATA (BlazeVOX, 2016)."
17,HEALTHY LIVING,3 Benefits of Embracing the Truth About Your Mental Health,"Alissa Lastres, ContributorNationally Certified Counselor (NCC) and yoga lover with a sou...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-benefits-of-embracing-the-truth-about-your-mental-health_b_9691450.html,Focusing on our mental health is simply about setting an intention to move the notch on that proverbial continuum toward a healthier mind; to understand that no matter where we currently fall on this continuum -- we all have room to become mentally healthier.,2016-04-17,cheering woman hiker open arms at mountain peak cliff,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9f4e30240000300095d399.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When we think of the phrase 'mental health,' we often picture the opposite of those two words -- we picture the stigma of mental illness.As a society, I think we view mental health and mental illness as a dichotomy -- placing them on two separate ends of a spectrum, assuming that we are either mentally healthy or mentally ill. This is a risky misperception, leading us toward separation rather than togetherness.But we can visualize a new association for this phrase by defining 'mental health' exactly how it sounds, as the health of our minds. When we reframe it this way we realize one simple, glaring, obvious and life changing little truth:We all have a mind.And, more importantly, we all experience times of feeling really put together and healthy and times of feeling beaten down and mentally unhealthy.Because mental health is truly a continuum--with fluidity and movement occurring on a daily basis.That experience is so beautifully human.Therefore, focusing on our mental health is simply about setting an intention to move the notch on that proverbial continuum toward a healthier mind; to understand that no matter where we currently fall on this continuum -- we all have room to become mentally healthier.So if we chose to see mental health as a continuum, rather than as a dichotomy, how might we benefit?1. We just might realize that we ALL need a little help sometimes.  No one is completely immune to the inner workings of the mind. The experience of occasionally feeling mentally unhealthy is universal. Once we see this, we might be more willing to let someone in so we can navigate the harder times together. We may recognize that there is beauty in unity and understand that we are not alone in our experiences.""When I becomes WE, even ILLNESS becomes WELLNESS"" -- unknown.2. We might not feel ashamed when our spirit is depleted. Our entire belief system surrounding mental health can change, replacing embarrassment with embracement. Through consistently bringing awareness to our mental health needs, we might become so attuned to the shifts in our continuum that we actually feel pride in our ability to detect the onset of a downward spiral and we do something about it almost immediately.3. We could finally welcome the need for a mental break -- or a mental health day to rejuvenate. Just as we might see a doctor if we aren't feeling physically healthy -- we recognize that we could see a therapist if we aren't feeling mentally healthy. Or, we could make some time for meditation, yoga, or another practice that promotes mental clarity, an opportunity to re-center, and provides relief from our thoughts. If we could remove the stigma surrounding mental health and show that yes, highs and lows are a part of life, good days and bad days make us human, and struggles and insecurities are okay, then maybe, just maybe, we will be more inclined to ask for help.Help at a time that could be life changing, maybe even life saving.Because the times when we want to shut down and isolate are the times when we need to own up to our stuff and let it out, to free ourselves of the build up that occurs when our negative thoughts and emotions manifest.So choose to see mental health as an opportunity for mental wellness in yourself and in others, to recognize that as a continuum -- it can shift from one day to the next.Choose to accept that all of us, no matter how put together we might seem, can devote more intentional energy to maintaining mental health and wellness, reaping the benefits of making peace with the ebb and flow of our mental states.

John Kasich (R) made a campaign stop at P.J. Bernstein, a kosher-style deli on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, on Saturday and the result was classic Kasich, in all of his fish-out-of-water goofiness.Kasich had a blank expression on his face as he bit into at least two pickles with TV cameras in the background. It didn’t exactly look like he was having a good time, but then, it rarely does.Kasich also had chicken soup with kreplach -- a traditional Jewish dumpling dish -- and apple strudel for dessert, according to reporters on the scene.He ultimately declined a pastrami sandwich.Some Twitter observers viewed the spectacle as bizarre.And at least one person noted that some of the pickles on Kasich’s plate appeared to be “new"" pickles, the least sour variety available -- an act of sacrilege to deli purists.Kasich then managed to further undermine his New York bona fides with an innocent question about a famous park in another borough.Nonetheless, Kasich’s deli foray is likely less awkward than another Jewish community campaign stop he made earlier this week. At a Jewish book store in the Hasidic Brooklyn enclave of Borough Park, Kasich was at pains to make small talk with some young yeshiva students patronizing the store. He ended up recounting the biblical story of Joseph’s sale into servitude, noting that was “how the Jews got to Egypt” -- something the devout Talmud scholars he was talking to undoubtedly learned in preschool.Still, chuckles about pickle-eating could be a welcome change of subject for the Republican presidential underdog. He is being criticized for his suggestion at a town hall in Watertown Friday that female college students can evade sexual assault by avoiding “parties with a lot of alcohol.”In addition to his Upper East Side nosh, Kasich has also been spotted in recent weeks feasting on Italian cuisine in the Bronx and pizza in Queens, which, to the shock of many natives, he chose to eat with a fork and knife.Kasich joked at a press conference earlier on Saturday that food has been the highlight of his vote-seeking efforts in the Empire State.The Ohio governor trails Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday’s New York primary by nearly 30 points, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average. He has the fewest delegates of the three remaining Republican candidates by far, having only won in his home state of Ohio.Kasich openly acknowledges that his only path to the nomination is through a contested convention, though even that prospect appears to be narrowing as he has failed to gain traction among voters in more moderate states this past month.But if he is hoping to pick up delegates in New York, which awards them on a proportional basis, the Upper East Side might be the right place to look.The neighborhood has long been a rare redoubt of Republican voters in famously liberal Manhattan. And they tend to be Republicans of the fiscally conservative variety Kasich must court if he is to have a shot. "

Mr. Bean. The Joker. Jack Ma. Spongebob Squarepants.These icons of pop culture are the latest figures to be drawn into the bizarre world of Chinese online propaganda.Today (April 15) is China’s first-ever National Security Education Day, a new “holiday” meant to publicize the importance of safeguarding state secrets, and by extension, promote the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party with regard to information security and human rights.To mark the occasion, the ministry of state security has produced a series of cartoon videos that mix abundant pop culture references with government sermonizing.Using Hollywood movie characters like James Bond, the five videos explain two laws that lay out the party’s stance on national security: the Counter-Espionage Law and the National Security Law (passed in November 2014 and July 2015, respectively).They get very bizarre, very quickly.In one episode explaining the National Security Law, the narrator encourages citizens to identify foreign spies in their daily lives. “Besides special forces, the FBI, and the CIA, you also might think of Superman, Batman, Iron Man, Spiderman, and Captain America [as spies],” the narrator says. “But actually, even in foreign countries, espionage is just a small part of national security.Those who safeguard [their country’s] national security [against China] are not men with magic powers and chest muscles,” he adds. Images of the words “Unemployed” or “Laid off” then appear above crying superheroes (video in Chinese)—implying that only disgruntled citizens or foreigners would upset national security.Another video instructs ordinary citizens to take action against behavior that threatens national security. A baby with large biceps photographs the Joker committing a crime and reports him to officials(video in Chinese), who promptly put him in jail. “If you discover there are elements working to undermine national security, immediately report to the relevant authorities and provide evidence,” the narrator says.Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish if something is intended to be funny or serious. In one video, the narrator explains how newer laws replace older ones. Within 30 seconds (video in Chinese) it references Colin Firth’s character in Kingsman: The Secret Service and modern-day software lingo:“[Espionage devices] have become so advanced—there are umbrellas that are not easy to carry, but can be used as a crutch,” the narrator explains, as Firth appears in background, firing bullets from an umbrella. “But our [old] national security law was still the same as it was 20 years ago. In November 2014, after installing patches, checking for bugs, and performing other rigorous tests, the new, updated Counter-Espionage Law finally hit the app store.”More cultural references fill the videos. In one of them, the narrator shouts a catchphrase from the video game World of Warcraft. In another, he encourages citizens to be like Jack Ma and thrust a positive global spotlight on China. Even Adolf Hitler makes a brief cameo—he gets punched by a giant boxing glove.The videos, like the laws themselves, don’t do much to describe what “national security” or “espionage” entail specifically. That’s by design. The Chinese government will often justify its more controversial actions on the grounds that it is merely protecting national security.When Chinese authorities detained Swedish human rights activist Peter Dahlin earlier this year, officials accused him of “funding criminal activities harmful to China’s national security.”Meanwhile, last year the Chinese government reportedly encouraged foreign internet companies to pledge they would store Chinese user data in China, all in the name of national security (paywall). Authorities also listed this practice as part of a draft counter-terrorism law, but it was dropped from a revised version that ultimately passed last December.China’s state broadcaster CCTV appears to be one of the first news outlets to show the cartoons. Under one of its Weibo posts (link in Chinese) about the cartoons, some bloggers described the videos as “so cute,” and hoped for more such government propaganda. One commenter praised the series as being “straight, easy to understand, and close to people.”Others have reacted to the videos with more skepticism: “I want to file a report!

26,THE WORLDPOST,What's Behind The Surge In Suicide Attempts Among Canada's Indigenous Population,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/canada-indigenous-suicide-crisis_us_570e78e5e4b03d8b7b9f173a,"More than 100 of Attawapiskat's 2,000 members have tried to end their lives in the last seven months, including 11 youth on Saturday alone.",2016-04-16,Northern Ontario's tiny Attawapiskat First Nation has entered a state of emergency following an alarmingly-high number of suicide attempts in recent months.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570fb5931900002e0056b335.jpeg?cache=ZH3gXxhy88&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. In this edition, we speak with Dr. Rod McCormick about the alarming number of suicide attempts throughout Canada's aboriginal communities. ""I didn't know that people cared about me, But people do care,"" 13-year-old Amy Hookimaw wrote in a widely shared Facebook post on Friday, after she was taken to a hospital in northern Ontario's tiny Attawapiskat community for experiencing suicidal thoughts. Ever since another 13-year-old girl from the community claimed her own life, many of her friends also wanted to die, Hookimaw explained. More than 100 of the isolated tribe's 2,000 members have attempted suicide in the last seven months, including 28 in March and 11 on Saturday alone, prompting Chief Bruce Shisheesh to declare a state of emergency. Two days later, local police broke up a suicide pact between 13 more youth there, including a 9-year-old.The surge in suicidal behavior extends beyond Attawapiskat. Suicide and self-inflicted injuries are the leading causes of death for Canada's indigenous population, comprised of Inuit, Métis and First Nations members who live in provinces and territories across the country. More than one in five aboriginal adults living off reserve have contemplated suicide, according to a study released by Statistics Canada in January.Suicide rates among Inuit are six to 11 times the Canadian average, and in the northern territory of Nunavut, suicide has accounted for more than one in four deaths since the territory's creation in 1999.Many of the country's 1.4 million aboriginal members live in poor conditions. They lack adequate employment opportunities and are far more likely to be incarcerated than non-aboriginal Canadians. An estimated 40 percent of indigenous youth live in poverty.Upon entering office, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to improve Canada's relationship with indigenous peoples who have long felt neglected by the government. Following the recent spike in suicide attempts, the federal and provincial governments pledged support for Attawapiskat, which includes immediately deploying a crisis team of mental health workers and nurses.On Wednesday, Ontario's health minister announced that up to $2 million in funding would be made available for resources including 24-hour mental health support services and a proposed youth center.The WorldPost spoke to Dr. Rod McCormick, an indigenous mental health expert based in British Columbia's Shuswap reserve and professor of Aboriginal Child and Maternal Health at Thompson Rivers University, about the crisis plaguing several of Canada's indigenous communities. What is behind the recent surge in suicide attempts in the Attawapiskat First Nation? There's a lot of unresolved trauma and unresolved grief and loss. A lot of people in the community are containing their pain and emotions through drugs and alcohol, through disassociating, and sometimes all it takes is one trigger when people are vulnerable. It could relate to childhood trauma; there's abuse that occurs, be it physical or sexual.In addition, most isolated reserves have very few facilities. There really is next to nothing for mental health services. Reserves may only have one nurse who has had limited training, and if there's a hospital it would be really tiny. It's just a shame that you have to declare a state of emergency before you can get the resources.Some extended families live in one house, because there isn't enough housing for everyone. Before a new school was built in Attawapiskat, the school was horrible and run-down.Is this a new phenomenon? When did suicide rates among aboriginal Canadians begin to rise?It's not new at all. It's hard to say [exactly] when the rates started to spike.I know there's been hope with the new government that more dollars will come in for health services and mental health services. Until a few years ago, we had the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, a program that created all kinds of healing centers and programs for mental health. The former federal government cut it, or did not renew it, at the same time that they launched the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.So it was asking aboriginal people across the country to open up wounds and tell their stories about abuse and residential schools and so on, while at the same time cutting the national healing programs. It didn't make any sense.Attempted suicide rates seem to be particularly high among indigenous youth. Why do you think that is?Young people may not feel like they belong anywhere or that they're contributing to the community. They might not be connected to the culture or spirituality, and their only real connection is to their peer group. If their peer group is obsessed with death and dying, then to belong to that group they have to be immersed in that culture of suicide.There isn't the possibility of going to movie theaters or driving fancy cars, or those things kids see on TV. There's the living conditions of feeling like a second-class citizen when one watches TV and sees what other people have that they don't. In what has since been called a ""cultural genocide,"" aboriginal children were forced to embrace Christianity and abandon their native traditions through Canada's residential schools in the 19th century. Is this legacy of assimilation contributing to the high number of suicide attempts we're seeing today?The family violence that occurs in some communities, whether it's sexual or physical, has a lot to do with the anger that people who have come out of residential schools feel.To survive residential school, you learned not to show emotion. The only safe expression was anger. For many people, anger became a default, and that anger gets taken out on others or yourself if you don't know how to express it in a good way.That has been very damaging; it just keeps perpetuating itself in generation after generation. We probably will feel that echo for a few more generations. This may be related to residential schools, but there is also an ongoing legacy of sexual abuse, and people don't like to talk about it. The provincial and federal governments have responded to Attawapiskat's crisis by deploying a team of mental experts in addition to pledging money for resources that may include a youth center. Will this solve the problem? It's great, but $2 million is not going to go too far. It certainly isn't a long-term solution. Supporting the youth through a center is better in the long run, but the $2 million is just a starter fund.I think we've never had same level of services that the rest of Canadians have had, even in terms of education and child welfare. There's a level of discrimination.Canada could provide one-week resiliency training programs [in affected indigenous communities] that would increase self-esteem, help people feel good about asking for help and teach them how to express emotions at an individual level.At a community level, if we have a position for a mental health facilitator who wouldn't necessarily have to be a training councilor, but someone from the community who is trusted, they could mobilize the healing resources that already exist. In a recent emergency debate in the House of Commons, Health Minister Jane Philpott said the situation ""unacceptable."" That's good to hear, because it seems like up until now the situation was acceptable to the government.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Are you in crisis? Need help? In Canada, find links and numbers to 24-hour suicide crisis lines in your province here.In the U.S., please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline."

Is this legacy of assimilation contributing to the high number of suicide attempts we're seeing today?The family violence that occurs in some communities, whether it's sexual or physical, has a lot to do with the anger that people who have come out of residential schools feel.To survive residential school, you learned not to show emotion. The only safe expression was anger. For many people, anger became a default, and that anger gets taken out on others or yourself if you don't know how to express it in a good way.That has been very damaging; it just keeps perpetuating itself in generation after generation. We probably will feel that echo for a few more generations. This may be related to residential schools, but there is also an ongoing legacy of sexual abuse, and people don't like to talk about it. The provincial and federal governments have responded to Attawapiskat's crisis by deploying a team of mental experts in addition to pledging money for resources that may include a youth center. Will this solve the problem? It's great, but $2 million is not going to go too far. It certainly isn't a long-term solution. Supporting the youth through a center is better in the long run, but the $2 million is just a starter fund.I think we've never had same level of services that the rest of Canadians have had, even in terms of education and child welfare. There's a level of discrimination.Canada could provide one-week resiliency training programs [in affected indigenous communities] that would increase self-esteem, help people feel good about asking for help and teach them how to express emotions at an individual level.At a community level, if we have a position for a mental health facilitator who wouldn't necessarily have to be a training councilor, but someone from the community who is trusted, they could mobilize the healing resources that already exist. In a recent emergency debate in the House of Commons, Health Minister Jane Philpott said the situation ""unacceptable."" That's good to hear, because it seems like up until now the situation was acceptable to the government.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Are you in crisis? Need help? In Canada, find links and numbers to 24-hour suicide crisis lines in your province here.In the U.S., please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline."

As part of the case, Cruz's office wrote in a brief that people don't have the legal right to masturbate, Mother Jones reported on Friday. (His office lost, by the way. Read more about the case here.)“There is no substantive-due-process right to stimulate one's genitals for non-medical purposes unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship,” the brief said.However, as Snopes points out, it was Cruz’s job at the time to argue the state’s position on the matter, so the brief his office put out doesn't necessarily reflect his personal beliefs. And the statement about people having the right to masturbate was actually referencing a 1985 ruling in which the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals made a similar statement.Even so, recent coverage of the 2007 case was starting to give Cruz a renewed rep for being down on self-love. Even his old roommate weighed in. But he cleared up his position on pleasure devices on Friday, when he told WABC radio host Curtis Sliwa that he will not enact anti-sex toy legislation if he makes it to the White House.“It’s a ridiculous question, and of course not,” Cruz told Sliwa. “What people do in their own private time with their selves is their own business, and it’s none of government’s business.”Cruz makes a good point there, but it’s really too bad his live-and-let-live mindset doesn’t extend to LGBT and reproductive rights."

32,THE WORLDPOST,Why People Join Nigeria's Boko Haram,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boko-haram-recruitment-tactics_us_571265afe4b06f35cb6fc595,Former members of the militant group offer some answers.,2016-04-16,"Aid group Mercy Corps spoke to 47 former members of Boko Haram about why they joined the group. Above, Nigerian soldiers after an operation against Boko Haram in Borno state.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571269751600002b0031bddc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The catalog of atrocities committed by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram is harrowing. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of women and children have been abducted from their homes. Captives report being gang-raped and forced into sexual slavery. Young girls have been sent to blow themselves up in suicide attacks. The relentless slaughter of men, women and children has made Boko Haram the deadliest terrorist group in the world in recent years.Why would anyone join such a group?A new report by aid agency Mercy Corps seeks to answer that question. The U.S.-based group interviewed 47 former members about the reasons they entered Boko Haram and published its findings this week.The militant group has thousands of members, including fighters and people playing other supportive roles, such as smuggling and logistics, analysts say. Its ranks are made up mostly of young men, but it also has some female recruits.The Mercy Corps report paints a complex picture of Boko Haram’s recruitment tactics.First, though Boko Haram has lately become notorious for abducting children and forcing captives to fight or carry out suicide attacks, not all recruits join against their will.Most ex-members interviewed by Mercy Corps fell in the gray area between coercion and choice. Some said they were threatened; some faced extreme pressure from friends, family or colleagues, while others saw the group as their least bad option in impoverished and marginalized northeast Nigeria.“I officially joined them when they started killing indiscriminately,” one man told Mercy Corps. “I needed protection and immunity from persecution by them so I could continue with my business.”Second, the group attracts recruits with a blend of religious ideology, social pressure and economic incentives.The financial draw is not just about escaping poverty and unemployment, both of which are high in northeast Nigeria. In fact, the study found Boko Haram recruits poor and rich, employed and unemployed alike.Rather, the group plays on the ambitions of young men who are struggling to get ahead in an area with scant financial services and pernicious inequality and corruption.Several former recruits depicted Boko Haram as a mafia-style organization, offering young entrepreneurs loans for small businesses like shops, salons and tailors and then forcing them to join the group when they couldn’t repay the loan. One man told Mercy Corps that his Boko Haram recruiter “started playing me their preaching tapes to convince me, and he equally started [financially] assisting me and my parents.” Soon after, his recruiter made it clear that he was obligated to join Boko Haram because of these financial “gifts,” so he fled for his life. Third, nearly half of the Boko Haram recruits interviewed for the study were women. Some of them were abducted or coerced by their husbands into joining; others were recruited voluntarily by friends or family.Some women told Mercy Corps that joining Boko Haram provided opportunities for religious study and status within the militant group. “I just wanted to learn more of the Quran and my religion,” one woman told Mercy Corps.The study provides an important insight into the profile and motivations of Boko Haram members and offers strategies to stem the flow of recruits. Mercy Corps urged more access to financial services, reintegration of former fighters and support for counter-narratives that have already proved effective against Boko Haram in northeast Nigeria.But it should be read with attention to an important piece of context -- Boko Haram has changed almost beyond recognition since it first emerged in 2002.Before the death of its founder, Muhammed Yusuf, in 2009, the group was a radical but predominantly nonviolent sect that espoused strict Islamic governance as the answer to the region's rampant corruption. After Yusuf was killed, Boko Haram went underground and re-emerged as a brutal insurgency under its hardline and elusive new leader, Abubakar Shekau. The study found a “marked difference” in Boko Haram’s recruitment techniques after 2009, Mercy Corps’ Rebecca Wolfe, who worked on the report, told The WorldPost. “As Boko Haram’s tactics became more violent, community acceptance started to go and people weren’t joining as much as being coerced,” she said.Further, some researchers said that the study’s depiction of Boko Haram attracting wealthier recruits through a coercive micro-lending scheme was more typical of the earlier days of the group under Mohammed Yusuf.“Yusuf was a wealthy man himself, as well as a charismatic preacher,” Virginia Comolli, the author of Boko Haram: Nigeria’s Islamist Insurgency, told The WorldPost. “He was able to offer people small amounts of money which they used to set up small businesses like motorbike taxis and paid the proceeds back into the group as membership fees.”“It was both a way of attracting people and attracting revenues.”Comolli and other researchers said they had not seen much evidence of such tactics since Yusuf’s death, but the Mercy Corps study found this practice of offering business incentives has continued. “We did speak with several former members who joined post-2009 who were at least partially influenced or coerced by the offer of business support,” study author Lisa Inks told The WorldPost.The study demonstrates how Boko Haram, like extremist groups around the world, has multiple ways to attract, intimidate and coerce recruits, including exploiting the socioeconomic and political grievances of the area. “People are attracted by the violent ideology and by their legitimate grievances against the state,” Comolli said. “You feel like you are somebody when you are given a gun and a mission.”"

But what about a fox cub who loves a stuffed bunny?Puggle was found in a London garden in March. The people who found him brought him to the RSPCA, who took him to the National Fox Welfare Society on March 15. The group nurses injured or abandoned foxes with the goal of releasing them back into the wild when they are ready.Puggle was only two weeks old when he was found, so he needed a lot of special care.National Fox Welfare Society director Martin Hemmington told SWNS news agency that if an orphaned fox comes in alone, he gives the young animal a stuffed toy for comfort.""When foxes come in a group, they've got each other for company but when they're on their own it's nice to give them something to cuddle up to,” he said. ""I give them a teddy, a hot water bottle and a clock, which is like a heart beat of their mum.”While most young foxes appreciate the amenities, Puggle loves his bunny “more than usual,” Hemmington said.""One minute he'll cuddle up to it then he'll go to the toilet on it and the next minute he's throwing it around and playing with it, our washing machine has been in overdrive,” he told SWNS.After photos of the doe-eyed Puggle started stealing hearts online, the fox rescue group has clarified on Facebook that the little guy doesn’t always look so darn sad.“Most of the photos I have taken of Puggle are after he has eaten and after he has had his mad ten minutes,” said an April update on a photo album of Puggle. “This then enables me to get some photos of him before he has his nap. This has led a few to believe that little Puggle has very sad eyes and must be sad. So today I thought I would get some photos of Puggle in his ten minute crazy mode.”We think Puggle is adorable no matter what, but it’s nice seeing him look a little more cheerful."

He was about to be set on fire.Balder had stopped to assist a Chicago-bound big rig that had stalled out in the rightmost lane of the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway. A heavy-duty tow truck and a bright yellow Tollway assistance vehicle were also pulled over, attending to the stranded semi.Balder, a Navy reservist and father of two, had his heater cranked against minus-30-degree wind chill. He had positioned his 2011 Crown Victoria behind the Tollway vehicle and switched on his flashers. There were also flares sputtering on the pavement, and the Tollway truck was flashing a large blinking arrow and its amber hazard lights. Visibility on that clear, cold night was excellent -- around 10 miles.Renato Velasquez, who was barreling toward the stopped vehicles in a flatbed big rig loaded with three massive rolls of steel, didn't see Balder's flashers. He didn't see the pulsing arrow or the flares. He didn’t change lanes or take any evasive action until far too late. Velasquez was falling asleep, a court would find later. His truck rammed into Balder's squad car at 63 miles per hour, according to the National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the accident. The impact crushed the Crown Vic’s trunk, exploding the gas tank and catapulting the patrol car into a roadside ditch. The three 14,580-pound steel coils chained to Velazquez's trailer bed burst their restraints. One of the massive rolls struck the cab of the Tollway vehicle, instantly killing its 39-year-old driver Vincent Petrella and injuring Agron Xhelaj, the driver of the stalled truck who was seated beside him. Balder had lost consciousness when his face hit the steering wheel.""I woke up a short time later on fire,” he said. “Literally on fire. Burning alive.”In that moment, Balder didn't know exactly what had happened. His squad car was half collapsed. The detonated gas tank was spraying fuel and flames through his cab. His only clear thoughts were of survival and of his wife of 14 years, Kimberlie. He yelled out her name.“A certain degree of that was emotion at the moment, knowing that I might die, screaming to the last person you might love,” he said.Balder needed to find a way to escape if he was ever going to see his wife and kids again.He tried to start his engine, then tried to radio for help. Fire was spreading from around the partition behind him, burning his back, head and legs. He couldn't open his door or window. He tried the switches on his armrest, and the passenger window miraculously cranked down.“As that cold air came in and swirled that air around, adrenaline set in, and I flew out,” he said. “The only other choice was to sit there and die.”He tumbled out on the roadside, rolling in the snow to extinguish the flames that had already scorched more than a third of his body. By the time he stumbled around the back of the wreck and back up to the road, local police were arriving to help.“You got this guy walking up with his skin hanging off his arm,"" Balder said. ""My pants were all burned off to the skin.”He spent six weeks in a medically induced coma, three months in the hospital, and needed 10 surgeries and extensive, ongoing rehab to recover.Increasing Carnage On Our HighwaysIn the two years since the accident, Balder has had plenty of time to think about what happened to him -- and why. On the simplest level, it happened because a criminally negligent driver pushed too hard and crashed. But it is also part of a broader trend of declining safety on the roads after decades of progress -- a trend that the United States Congress has aided and abetted by loosening safety rules even as both truck drivers and trucks are being pushed to their limits, just like Renato Velasquez.Truck-related deaths hit an all-time low during the economic doldrums of 2009, when 2,983 truck accidents killed 3,380 people. But as the economy has recovered, the carnage has been on the rise. In 2013, the most recent year for which finalized statistics are available, 3,541 wrecks killed 3,964 people -- an increase of 17.3 percent in just four years. In 2014, the number of deaths resulting from truck accidents was down slightly, but the total number of crashes and injuries increased.At the same time, Congress has been caving, very quietly, to lobbying from trucking interests that want to roll back, block or modify at least a half-dozen important safety regulations. Significant parts of the hauling industry have long opposed many of the federal rules governing working hours, rest periods, size and weight limits, and safety standards. When the Great Recession began in 2008, profit margins for shippers shrank and bankruptcies rose, prompting a desperate industry to step up its lobbying effort. Perhaps, the trucking companies' lobbyists suggested to Congress, trucks could haul loads heavier than the federal 80,000-pound limit, which would allow them to deliver more goods with each truck. Maybe they could have longer double trailers, increasing the limit from 28 feet for each unit to 33 feet -- turning each rig into an 80-foot-long behemoth, as long as an eight-story building is tall. Or they could let truck drivers be more flexible with their rest breaks, which would allow them to work up to 82 hours a week instead of the already-exhausting limit of 70. Maybe trucking firms could reduce labor costs by hiring lower-paid drivers, younger than 21 -- as young as 18. Maybe they could stop federal regulators from raising insurance requirements that were set during the Reagan administration. Maybe the federal motor carrier safety ratings for unsafe trucking companies could be kept secret.Indeed, the trucking industry is trying to do all of those things. If they are successful, these changes would amount to the most significant overhaul of highway safety rules in decades. But most people don't know such sweeping revisions are even being considered.Asleep At The WheelThe latest round of congressional wrangling started with a fight over snoring, or, more specifically, the obstructive sleep apnea that causes it.For decades, mounting evidence has shown that sleep apnea, a common disorder, can cause perilous levels of fatigue in drivers, pilots, train engineers and others who need to remain alert at work. The airways of people who suffer from apnea close repeatedly while they sleep, interrupting their breathing dozens of times an hour. They often don't notice the interruptions, but it leaves them exhausted and prone to doze off during the day. Behind the wheel of a large, speeding vehicle, the results are predictably catastrophic. It's not just a problem for truckers. As investigators sorted through a Dec. 1, 2013, Metro-North commuter train derailment in New York that killed four people, they found the engineer at the controls, William Rockefeller, had fallen asleep. His shift had recently been changed, which can cause sleep problems in itself, but he also had undiagnosed sleep apnea. Since 2008, experts with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates the trucking industry, have recommended that drivers get checked for the condition and treated if necessary. The NTSB lists sleep apnea as a problem across the transportation industry, and often points to the Metro-North wreck as evidence of why the trucking industry in particular needs better regulation -- its rules are the weakest of the major transportation sectors.The risk of apnea rises dramatically with weight gain, and approximately two-thirds of all truck drivers are believed to be obese, according to a recent federal survey. Other studies have also found that truckers are much more likely to be overweight than workers in other fields. And extensive research links sleep deprivation to heightened crash risks; even moderate tiredness can impair a driver as much as being legally intoxicated. A recent Harvard study found truck drivers with obstructive sleep apnea are five times more likely to crash than their fellows.To do a better job dealing with the issue, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration floated a proposal in April 2012 that would have required overweight truckers to get checked for sleep apnea. The industry was livid. Some drivers claimed there was no evidence that sleep apnea raised the risk of crashes, while others alleged the proposal was a scheme to enrich sleep doctors.Independent truckers are especially loath to admit a problem because treatment can take them off the road for a month or more. And sleep tests and treatment cost thousands of dollars for people with inadequate or no health insurance.Despite acknowledging the problem and the need to deal with it, FMCSA backed off its push to update the apnea rules. Just a week after posting the proposal, the agency withdrew it, claiming it was published in error.Going After CongressThe trucking industry did not let the matter drop, though. Instead, its lobbyists launched a pre-emptive strike.Normally, when an agency like FMCSA targets a specific issue, it uses its existing authority to propose binding guidance. Taking this route -- which the agency started to do with apnea -- is easier than embarking on a full federal rulemaking process, which can take years, requires even more extensive input from the public and industry, and often triggers long legal battles.Rather than taking the chance that FMCSA might resurrect its proposal on apnea screening, industry lobbyists approached allies in Congress to write a law that would require the agency to follow the longer, more cumbersome formal rulemaking course.Trucking industry lobbyists sold the bill as a safety enhancement. In their telling, it sounded like truckers were asking regulators to come up with a way to screen for dangerous apnea, not blocking an effort to enhance screenings.Members of Congress bought the spin. ""I can only hope that the agency, which has a long docket, in fact gets to this rulemaking,"" said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) in a brief discussion on the the House floor. ""I'm not sure why the agency was going to do guidance instead, but this is a very important issue. There have been accidents attributed to sleep apnea.""Then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) allowed the bill's sponsors to bring it to the floor on Sept. 26, 2013, when the country was focused on the prospect of a looming government shutdown in the next four days. Safety advocates had little opportunity to raise objections. The bill passed with no opposition and was sent to the Senate. It passed the upper chamber a week later, in the middle of the shutdown, with no debate or even a roll-call vote. The legislation was slipped into a string of unanimous consent requests, lost among resolutions supporting democracy in Venezuela and recognizing Danish Holocaust survivors. President Barack Obama signed the law on Oct. 15, without comment, just before the government shutdown ended.Less than two months later, the Metro-North engineer took a curve along the Hudson River in the Bronx at 82 miles per hour -- 52 mph over the limit -- while he dozed at the controls. Seven cars derailed. Three of the four people killed were ejected from the train. No one noticed that Congress had just made it more difficult to screen truckers for similar sleep disorders.Congress Waters Down Safety RulesHorrifying crashes have a way of focusing Congress' attention on safety -- at least while the headlines are bold and the corpses are fresh. The rest of the time, lawmakers tend to listen to industry groups, which warn of job losses and higher costs if their demands aren't met. These conversations happen inside the cloister of legislative process, shielded from scrutiny. If what business wants doesn't put health or safety first -- and it often doesn't -- politicians try to meet the demand by adding provisions to much larger legislative vehicles, where they may be impossible to dislodge, if they are even discovered at all.Consider this example.In July 2013, the FMCSA enacted a regulation modifying an existing rule that says drivers must take 34 hours off after they hit certain maximum time limits working and driving. The new restriction mandated that truckers include two nights in that break, with no driving between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. The new rule effectively cut the maximum hours drivers could work from 82 per week to 70. Studies show that humans get the best, most restorative rest while slumbering at night, and truckers face especially tough schedules, so the restriction forced drivers to have two restful, overnight periods in their break, which is known as a ""restart.""But trucking lobbyists argued that making drivers sleep at night was more dangerous because it would put more trucks on the road in the morning hours, with commuters and school buses. The industry pointed to data that shows more accidents occur when there are more vehicles on the roads during the day. The lobbyists neglected to mention data showing that the rate of fatal accidents actually more than doubles during the overnight hours, even with vastly fewer automobiles on the roads.As soon as the updated regulation went into effect, trucking groups demanded changes, but FMCSA, which had spent years working on the rule, wasn't listening. That left the industry with the choice of pursuing an uncertain challenge in the courts, or appealing to Congress for relief.By law, Congress can vote to disapprove a new executive agency regulation, such as the sleep rule, within 60 work days of the rule's publication. If Congress doesn't pass a disapproval resolution, lawmakers can propose specific legislation undoing the new rule, and hold hearings on the proposal in the relevant committee -- in this case, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.Going through either of those processes is the transparent, above-board approach. But that path does not often get the trucking industry what it wants. For years, the late New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D), a member of the commerce committee, blocked anything that he thought eroded highway safety, as did other safety-conscious members on the committee. Lautenberg's successor, Sen. Cory Booker (D), has sought to take up that mantle.The trucking industry needed a detour. It looked for an alternate route through the Senate Appropriations Committee, and found Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who represents the trucking-friendly state of Maine. Collins added a provision temporarily barring FMCSA from spending any money to enforce its new rule and requiring additional study of the issue to a $54 billion transportation bill during an untelevised legislative markup in June 2014.The under-the-radar move might have been the end of the new rule. But unlike with the apnea bill a year before, a headline-grabbing tragedy caught the nation's attention shortly before the appropriations bill made it to the full Senate. Two days after Collins got her amendment included, an exhausted Walmart truck driver speeding along the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into comedian Tracy Morgan's limo. The wreck killed Morgan’s friend James McNair and left Morgan and four others severely injured. The crash generated headlines around the world, and once again focused the nation’s attention on the dangers of sleep-deprived drivers behind the wheels of 80,000-pound vehicles.When the transportation spending bill came to the Senate floor on June 19, Booker was waiting with his own amendment to block that of Collins. He took up his microphone and delivered a blistering speech against the provision, forcing Collins to defend the measure. But before the bill went to a vote, Senate leaders pulled the measure from consideration, in part because of the sudden controversy.Collins didn’t give up, though. When the nation was again facing a government shutdown in the winter, she managed to slip her sleep-rule provision into the so-called CRomnibus, a huge, unwieldy spending measure that needed to pass by Dec. 13 to keep the government open. No one outside of Congress knew that the trucking provision had been attached to the bill until lawmakers shoved their shambling creation into the light on Dec. 9, four days before it needed to pass. At that point, the measure could not be blocked, as it had been in the aftermath of Tracy Morgan's crash. Like the sleep apnea rule a year before, it passed under the cover of a funding battle, much to the disappointment of safety advocates, including Morgan's lawyer, Benedict Morelli.""I don't understand how in good conscience anybody could be pushing to relax the federal rules,"" Morelli said. ""The reason that they’ve been put in place is to make sure this doesn’t happen -- and it happens a lot.""Shocking Headlines, Shockingly OftenMorelli is right: Accidents like those that nearly killed Balder and Morgan happen with startling regularity. For instance, last spring while Congress was again quietly targeting trucking regulations, a string of crashes showed vividly the consequences of overtired truckers pushing past their limits.On April 22, 2015 a truck driven by John Wayne Johnson barreled through a line of cars backed up by an earlier truck crash on Interstate 16 in Georgia. Johnson killed five nursing students from Georgia Southern University headed to their last training shift of the year. Lawsuits filed over the wreck say he had sleep apnea and a history of falling asleep at the wheel. He also may have been looking at pornographic pictures.On May 19, witnesses saw a tractor-trailer drifting between lanes as it neared a construction zone on that same Georgia interstate, near I-95. The driver, David Gibbons, 61, smashed his rig into the stopped cars and also killed five people.On June 25, Benjamin Brewer, 39, spent 50 hours at work and was allegedly high on meth when he approached construction traffic on I-75 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was going so fast, his truck careened on for 453 feet after impacting the first car, according to the NTSB. He killed six people.On July 23, trucker Ruslan Pankiv failed to notice traffic backed up at a construction zone on I-65 near Lafayette, Indiana. He plowed through the stopped vehicles, killing five people, including a mother, her two young sons and himself. Again, police suspected fatigue.Those are just cases for which drowsiness was explicitly stated as a possible cause. Most independent experts believe fatigue-related wrecks are significantly undercounted since there is no roadside exam or blood test for drowsiness, and drivers are often reluctant to admit they were nodding off.In the case of Renato Velasquez, he insisted he hadn't dozed off, but he could come up with no other explanation his wreck. By the time the scientifically careful NTSB released its final report on Velasquez's accident, on Feb. 9, 2016, he'd already been convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for driving while fatigued, ignoring federal rest rules, driving too fast and failing to yield.What's beyond debate is that hauling loads across America's highways is a draining, exhausting existence. And it's only gotten tougher since President Jimmy Carter and Congress deregulated the complex rules governing the economic side of the industry in 1980, making it much easier for new companies to get into the business and setting off a surge in competition.The change was good for consumers, who saw shipping prices drop as lower-cost carriers pushed out unionized firms. And safety did not immediately suffer, because technology improved and both the government and carriers grew more conscious of the practices that reduce the risk of crashes.But as unions vanished and the need for productivity and efficiency rose, pay for truck drivers plummeted. They now make less than they did in the late 1970s when wages are adjusted for inflation. And there are now tens of thousands of small, poorly financed new trucking companies that have great incentive to push drivers as hard as they can.Those drivers, who are often independent and own their own rigs, have to cope with managers' demands and all the safety rules that still exist, even as the close-to-the-bone industry leaves little room for error. Unpredictable hours, uncertain traffic, long stretches spent sitting alone behind a wheel, and meals that depend on roadside greasy spoons take a toll on drivers' health. All that adds up to a circumstance that encourages drivers -- especially the growing number who have strict drop-off and pick-up times set in their contracts -- to take chances. And they do, frequently ignoring rest rules to make their schedules. Drivers for smaller outfits are especially likely to break the rules.Renato Velasquez is a case in point.His daughter Yesenia told NTSB investigators that her father had dreamed of driving big rigs. He had been a bus driver in rural Mexico, transporting workers to farms back in the '80s. He immigrated to the United States, and in 2007 earned his commercial driver's license in Illinois. His first job driving flatbeds was at a company called M&A, where his brother worked, and where he learned the federal safety rules.Velasquez told the NTSB he took a job with another firm, DND International, in 2011, after meeting the company's manager, Dimitar Dimitrievsky. The company, one of thousands of small-time shipping operations that have proliferated since deregulation, employed 49 drivers. Those drivers logged 5.4 million miles in 2013, the year before Velasquez's crash.Velasquez seldom saw the boss, or any other workers, and was dispatched remotely, according to his interview with federal investigators. He and another driver said they would drop off their logbooks and other records at a box outside Dimitrievsky's house once a week. There appeared to be little oversight or enforcement at the company, the NTSB concluded. Although Velasquez said he never got safety training from his employer, records say that he received at least a little, and the company did possess some of the required safety training materials. But DND also possessed a terrible, albeit remarkably common, safety record.In the two years before the crash, DND drivers had been subjected to 289 inspections, according to federal records. Its drivers had been ordered off the roads 27 times, most often for hours-of-service violations -- driving more than the legal limit. The vehicles themselves were found to be in violation 26 times in 131 inspections, a failure rate of 20 percent. The company racked up seven crashes between March 2012 and January 2014, causing one fatality and four injuries. Those stats meant that DND had alerts in two Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASICs) that the FMCSA uses to rate companies and identify dangerous carriers. BASIC serves as the foundation for the agency's Safety Measurement System -- a system that the trucking industry despises. DND had poor scores in the BASIC standards for safe driving and driver fatigue. The chances of a firm being involved in a fatal crash jump by 93 percent when it has an alert on unsafe driving and by 83 percent when it has received a warning for excessive hours-of-service violations, according to agency data. And firms with two alerts have crash rates that are double the average among companies with no alerts.Independent drivers like Velasquez and his colleagues are paid by the load, not by the number of hours they work. A decent living requires good loads. To get good loads, a trucker needs a strong relationship with his trucking company's dispatchers, who take orders from shipping brokers and route them to available tractors. Trips that are longer, more time-consuming or force the driver to return empty -- hauling ""flying canaries"" or ""dispatcher brains"" -- can even cost a driver money. A DND driver named Stanford Dean told NTSB investigators that his loads weren't even dispatched in the United States. They came from someone based in Macedonia.""Do you know how difficult it is to make money?"" Dean asked investigators who confronted him over discrepancies in his logbooks. ""I'm a safe guy, but there's issues sometimes,"" Dean added. ""There's so many obstacles. If anybody tells you they roll 100 percent by the book, they're lying to you.""On Velasquez's fateful run, he had a decent assignment from the dispatchers, hauling power cables approximately 450 miles from Illinois to Nebraska, for a $1,600 fee. On the way back he would stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to pick up three steel coils that he would haul a little more than 200 miles back toward home, for a fee of $550. After gas, tolls and DND's 20 percent cut, he would pocket about $1,000 for the out-and-back.According to Velasquez's logbook for the trip that killed Vincent Petrella, he followed safety rules. It says Velasquez left Hanover Park at 11:45 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 26, carrying a 6,707-pound load of cable to the Omaha Public Power District in Elkhorn, Nebraska. The entries say he reached Des Moines, Iowa, at about 5:30 p.m., took a 45-minute break, then motored on to Elkhorn by 9 p.m., keeping his driving time well inside the 11-hour limit and his on-duty hours within the 14 permitted in a day.But Velasquez's logbook was a work of fiction.Investigators would later learn how badly things went wrong for Velasquez, and how severely he broke the rules, leading to his deadly exhaustion.Velasquez's cell phone and toll records showed he didn't set out on the trip until nearly six hours after the time he recorded in his logbook, and he kept driving well past the time that he claimed he had settled in for a night's rest.The problem was that this was a trip across the Midwest in the dead of winter, with a brutal deep freeze, snow, fog and whipping winds along the way. Ahead of Velasquez on I-88, two other trucks crashed at 9:43 p.m. in whiteout conditions, shutting down the highway for four hours. Velasquez wasn't even out of Illinois at that point, and that traffic jam may have been his only rest in 37 hours. According to the truck's engine records retrieved by the NTSB, the longest it was idle that Sunday night and early Monday morning was for less than three hours.Velasquez couldn't just pull in for some extra rest after the long night. A requirement of the delivery contract with the Omaha Public Power District was a punctual drop-off at 8:30 in morning. The driver logged in at the drop-off at 8:45 a.m. Records showed Velasquez departing at 9:20 for a 300-mile run to Cedar Rapids, where his pickup window for the three steel coils began at 4 p.m. He left at 5:15 with another 200-plus miles and four hours left to reach home.But about an hour before he got that far, a truck that hauled containers from railways broke down ahead of him in Aurora, Illinois, just shy of Velasquez's destination. It was owned by a firm called Michael's Cartage that had alerts in four of the FMCSA's troubling categories, including maintenance. Its drivers falsified work logs more than half of the time, according to an NTSB review. Just like with DND International, the numbers suggested the carrier was more than twice as likely to wind up in a crash. In this case, the Cartage truck became the hazard that Velasquez failed to avoid.He never wrote down his final stop, at 9:20 p.m. -- when he dozed off at the wheel and forever changed Doug Balder's life. Paying For InfluenceThe leader of the trucking industry's campaign to tilt federal regulations in its favor is an alliance of the nation's largest shippers called the Coalition for Efficient and Responsible Trucking, or CERT. Its most prominent members are FedEx and UPS.Members of CERT have donated more than $13 million to federal election campaigns since 2012, and spent $80 million on well-connected lobbyists, according to a Public Citizen study from 2015 using data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as well HuffPost's analysis of more recent congressional lobbying reports through the rest of the year. The American Trucking Associations, which advocates on behalf of the industry, spent another $8 million on lobbying and $2.4 million on elections. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, another industry group, has chipped in $3.5 million for lobbying and $790,000 on campaigns. It amounts to more than $20 million spent each year, solely to influence Congress.Trucking industry lobbyists have the kind of access to decision-makers that safety advocates can only imagine. Among FedEx lobbyists alone, 37 of 51 previously worked in government, according to CRP.Those influence brokers have been exceptionally busy and effective, securing victories on apnea screening in 2013 and the roll-back of sleep rules in 2014. In 2015, they aimed for much more. In the House, industry-friendly lawmakers were persuaded to add several policy riders to the annual transportation funding bill for 2016 in May, again bypassing committees and hearings, as Sen. Collins did with sleep rules.Bigger And More DangerousPerhaps the most controversial of those measures was a scheme to take away the ability of states to set their own standards for the maximum lengths of double trailers. A federal law passed in 1982 required all states to allow doubles, with each of those trailers up to 28 feet long. Many states, particularly in the West, allow longer trailers. The new measure would have raised the federal limit to 33 feet for each trailer, and forced all states to accept them.Companies such as FedEx and UPS have long sought to extend the length of trailers, because they often fill the 28-foot model with packages before hitting the 80,000-pound weight limit. Carrying more with each rig means greater efficiency, lower cost and more profit.But larger, heavier trucks also mean more wear and tear on highways and bridges that are already poorly maintained. Weigh stations and other facilities handling trucks would also need to be renovated and expanded, often at taxpayers' expense.Law enforcement and safety advocates also warn that double trailers are already more dangerous than regular semis, with an 11 percent higher crash fatality rate.“From a safety perspective, double 33-foot trailers are basically a disaster,"" said Robert Mills, a Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who spent 13 years as a roadside safety inspector and is a member of the Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee, which recommends rules to the federal government. Many truckers are not so pleased with the giant double trailers either, dubbing them ""wiggle wagons"" and ""widow makers."" Some haulers, including the smaller conglomerates Swift and Knight, joined with the Coalition Against Bigger Trucks to oppose their larger brethren's push to extend trailer lengths. Even crashes of doubles where there are no injuries in the initial impact leave dangerous scenes for other drivers when they're sprawled out across multiple lanes of traffic, said Balder, who is now working with the coalition.But CERT, the coalition of shippers, is determined to get approval for larger trucks, and was behind a push in 2012 requiring the Department of Transportation to study the impacts of size and weight increases. The industry coalition believed, or at least argued, that those impacts would be negligible; research proving that would help their case. But before that study was even completed, the coalition got its provision allowing longer trucks added to the House's version of the 2016 transportation spending bill. The DOT study, released in June 2015 two weeks after the House released the transportation bill, recommended against allowing larger trucks, saying the safety issues remained unresolved.There were several other industry requests in that funding bill for 2016, including a measure that aimed to extend the suspension of sleep rules that Collins had won just six months earlier. Her suspension lasted a year and required regulators to look into the effectiveness of requiring two nights of sleep and whether there was any case for the trucking industry's position. But rather than see that process through, the new provision changed the study mid-stream and called for gathering even more data — including the regulation's impact on the longevity of drivers. Studying workers' lifespans, of course, takes entire lifespans. That provision was signed into law with the 2016 spending bill that ultimately passed.“They just basically want to stall this forever,"" said Rep. David Price (N.C.), the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that deals with transportation.Another measure the industry pushed last year aimed to short-circuit federal regulators' efforts to evaluate raising insurance requirements for trucking companies. Currently, carriers have to maintain the same $750,000 policies they did in the '80s. The industry’s argument is that independent operators would not be able to afford higher premiums -- and indeed, DND's margins were so close it shut down when its insurance company raised rates after the Balder crash. The industry argues that 99 percent of truck accidents do not generate such high damages. But $750,000 doesn't begin to cover the costs a serious semi wreck incurs. For instance, a widower whose wife was killed and children severely injured by a dozing driver in 2010 won $41 million in damages. The family of James McNair, the comedian who died in the Tracy Morgan crash, settled for $10 million in March last year. A somewhat weakened version of the measure did pass, requiring regulators to evaluate a number of different factors before they adjust the insurance requirements.Another industry-backed provision aimed to hide the BASIC safety measurements for trucking companies from public view, and bar their use in lawsuits. The lawsuit provision was dropped from the spending bill during negotiations, but the BASIC scores were in fact hidden and removed from the agency's website. The industry used a Government Accountability Office study that found the safety system could do better in some respects to justify its position, but the two firms involved in the Velasquez crash had exactly the sort of poor safety scores that the BASIC system predicts make them more likely to be involved in accidents.Despite the fact that these provisions will likely have an impact on the safety of nearly 11 million large trucks registered in America, they were all buried in legislation that Congress had to pass to avoid a government shutdown, with little to no debate about whether they were a good idea.""The advocates of relaxing the rules or eliminating the rules, they see that and think this is their train to catch. ... Not just wait on the normal process, or count on something as pedestrian as actual hearings or discussion, but to make a summary judgement and latch it on to an appropriations bill,"" Price said.There's something else all the industry-backed measures have in common: They are deeply unpopular.The Huffington Post and YouGov surveyed Americans on four of the proposals the industry has been pursuing through the backdoor: teen drivers, longer trucks, heavier trucks, and the relaxed hours-of-service rules. In every case, respondents to the survey opposed the moves -- by large margins.Indeed, when proposals to weaken trucking safety do get a up-or-down vote on their own, they generally fail. When the Senate's version of the transportation funding bill came up for debate in November and October, an attempt to include the House's requirement for states to accept 33-foot trailers across the nation was voted down each time. Similarly, an attempt in the House last November to amend the highway construction bill to hike truck weight limits failed convincingly, 187 to 236.The trucking industry is certainly still trying, though. The backdoor approach is the easiest way for the industry to get around the safety restrictions that most Americans support. One initiative that it backed down on in 2015 was a bid to block states from enforcing regulations on rest and pay that are tougher than the federal government's. Large haulers got the preemption added to the House's highway construction bill, but couldn't get senators to consent.The trucking industry is back at it this year, adding a provision that would override state rest and overtime pay rules to a House bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration, which is currently operating on a stopgap measure that expires in mid-July. The Senate is working on a dramatically different version of that bill, which almost guarantees a situation where trucking lobbyists have thrived -- a rush to finish a must-pass bill behind closed doors with a looming deadline and little ability to alter deeply buried provisions.A Problem He Can't ForgetFor Douglas Balder, crashes are not just a byproduct of business and politics. His own near-fatal encounter is burned into his flesh and his memory.While he can't forget it, he also doesn't want to. He's read most of the 5,000-page NTSB investigation of his crash, and he still looks at the pictures of his destroyed squad car every couple of weeks. He said he doesn't know why he wants to keep replaying that night. ""I’ve been asked that question before, and I can’t answer it,"" he said.But he does have an answer, really.Balder joined the Navy reserves right after graduating high school in 1994 and has served tours overseas, including in Iraq and North Africa. He is the sort of person who walks in the St. Jude's parade and donates blood. And he now has another reason to keep trying -- a third child who was conceived and born after he was nearly killed on the side of that highway.""We all take an oath to make things better in the long run,"" he said. ""And it’s got to be our focus now. I could easily have shriveled up in a ball and stayed at home and wasted away, but that’s not my mindset. That’s the military in me: You gotta move on -- pick up and move on -- and try to make a difference for the future. And I have to remind myself of what happened."""

He was about to be set on fire.Balder had stopped to assist a Chicago-bound big rig that had stalled out in the rightmost lane of the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway. A heavy-duty tow truck and a bright yellow Tollway assistance vehicle were also pulled over, attending to the stranded semi.Balder, a Navy reservist and father of two, had his heater cranked against minus-30-degree wind chill. He had positioned his 2011 Crown Victoria behind the Tollway vehicle and switched on his flashers. There were also flares sputtering on the pavement, and the Tollway truck was flashing a large blinking arrow and its amber hazard lights. Visibility on that clear, cold night was excellent -- around 10 miles.Renato Velasquez, who was barreling toward the stopped vehicles in a flatbed big rig loaded with three massive rolls of steel, didn't see Balder's flashers. He didn't see the pulsing arrow or the flares. He didn’t change lanes or take any evasive action until far too late. Velasquez was falling asleep, a court would find later. His truck rammed into Balder's squad car at 63 miles per hour, according to the National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the accident. The impact crushed the Crown Vic’s trunk, exploding the gas tank and catapulting the patrol car into a roadside ditch. The three 14,580-pound steel coils chained to Velazquez's trailer bed burst their restraints. One of the massive rolls struck the cab of the Tollway vehicle, instantly killing its 39-year-old driver Vincent Petrella and injuring Agron Xhelaj, the driver of the stalled truck who was seated beside him. Balder had lost consciousness when his face hit the steering wheel.""I woke up a short time later on fire,” he said. “Literally on fire. Burning alive.”In that moment, Balder didn't know exactly what had happened. His squad car was half collapsed. The detonated gas tank was spraying fuel and flames through his cab. His only clear thoughts were of survival and of his wife of 14 years, Kimberlie. He yelled out her name.“A certain degree of that was emotion at the moment, knowing that I might die, screaming to the last person you might love,” he said.Balder needed to find a way to escape if he was ever going to see his wife and kids again.He tried to start his engine, then tried to radio for help. Fire was spreading from around the partition behind him, burning his back, head and legs. He couldn't open his door or window. He tried the switches on his armrest, and the passenger window miraculously cranked down.“As that cold air came in and swirled that air around, adrenaline set in, and I flew out,” he said. “The only other choice was to sit there and die.”He tumbled out on the roadside, rolling in the snow to extinguish the flames that had already scorched more than a third of his body. By the time he stumbled around the back of the wreck and back up to the road, local police were arriving to help.“You got this guy walking up with his skin hanging off his arm,"" Balder said. ""My pants were all burned off to the skin.”He spent six weeks in a medically induced coma, three months in the hospital, and needed 10 surgeries and extensive, ongoing rehab to recover.Increasing Carnage On Our HighwaysIn the two years since the accident, Balder has had plenty of time to think about what happened to him -- and why. On the simplest level, it happened because a criminally negligent driver pushed too hard and crashed. But it is also part of a broader trend of declining safety on the roads after decades of progress -- a trend that the United States Congress has aided and abetted by loosening safety rules even as both truck drivers and trucks are being pushed to their limits, just like Renato Velasquez.Truck-related deaths hit an all-time low during the economic doldrums of 2009, when 2,983 truck accidents killed 3,380 people. But as the economy has recovered, the carnage has been on the rise. In 2013, the most recent year for which finalized statistics are available, 3,541 wrecks killed 3,964 people -- an increase of 17.3 percent in just four years. In 2014, the number of deaths resulting from truck accidents was down slightly, but the total number of crashes and injuries increased.At the same time, Congress has been caving, very quietly, to lobbying from trucking interests that want to roll back, block or modify at least a half-dozen important safety regulations. Significant parts of the hauling industry have long opposed many of the federal rules governing working hours, rest periods, size and weight limits, and safety standards. When the Great Recession began in 2008, profit margins for shippers shrank and bankruptcies rose, prompting a desperate industry to step up its lobbying effort. Perhaps, the trucking companies' lobbyists suggested to Congress, trucks could haul loads heavier than the federal 80,000-pound limit, which would allow them to deliver more goods with each truck. Maybe they could have longer double trailers, increasing the limit from 28 feet for each unit to 33 feet -- turning each rig into an 80-foot-long behemoth, as long as an eight-story building is tall. Or they could let truck drivers be more flexible with their rest breaks, which would allow them to work up to 82 hours a week instead of the already-exhausting limit of 70. Maybe trucking firms could reduce labor costs by hiring lower-paid drivers, younger than 21 -- as young as 18. Maybe they could stop federal regulators from raising insurance requirements that were set during the Reagan administration. Maybe the federal motor carrier safety ratings for unsafe trucking companies could be kept secret.Indeed, the trucking industry is trying to do all of those things. If they are successful, these changes would amount to the most significant overhaul of highway safety rules in decades. But most people don't know such sweeping revisions are even being considered.Asleep At The WheelThe latest round of congressional wrangling started with a fight over snoring, or, more specifically, the obstructive sleep apnea that causes it.For decades, mounting evidence has shown that sleep apnea, a common disorder, can cause perilous levels of fatigue in drivers, pilots, train engineers and others who need to remain alert at work. The airways of people who suffer from apnea close repeatedly while they sleep, interrupting their breathing dozens of times an hour. They often don't notice the interruptions, but it leaves them exhausted and prone to doze off during the day. Behind the wheel of a large, speeding vehicle, the results are predictably catastrophic. It's not just a problem for truckers. As investigators sorted through a Dec. 1, 2013, Metro-North commuter train derailment in New York that killed four people, they found the engineer at the controls, William Rockefeller, had fallen asleep. His shift had recently been changed, which can cause sleep problems in itself, but he also had undiagnosed sleep apnea. Since 2008, experts with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates the trucking industry, have recommended that drivers get checked for the condition and treated if necessary. The NTSB lists sleep apnea as a problem across the transportation industry, and often points to the Metro-North wreck as evidence of why the trucking industry in particular needs better regulation -- its rules are the weakest of the major transportation sectors.The risk of apnea rises dramatically with weight gain, and approximately two-thirds of all truck drivers are believed to be obese, according to a recent federal survey. Other studies have also found that truckers are much more likely to be overweight than workers in other fields. And extensive research links sleep deprivation to heightened crash risks; even moderate tiredness can impair a driver as much as being legally intoxicated. A recent Harvard study found truck drivers with obstructive sleep apnea are five times more likely to crash than their fellows.To do a better job dealing with the issue, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration floated a proposal in April 2012 that would have required overweight truckers to get checked for sleep apnea. The industry was livid. Some drivers claimed there was no evidence that sleep apnea raised the risk of crashes, while others alleged the proposal was a scheme to enrich sleep doctors.Independent truckers are especially loath to admit a problem because treatment can take them off the road for a month or more. And sleep tests and treatment cost thousands of dollars for people with inadequate or no health insurance.Despite acknowledging the problem and the need to deal with it, FMCSA backed off its push to update the apnea rules. Just a week after posting the proposal, the agency withdrew it, claiming it was published in error.Going After CongressThe trucking industry did not let the matter drop, though. Instead, its lobbyists launched a pre-emptive strike.Normally, when an agency like FMCSA targets a specific issue, it uses its existing authority to propose binding guidance. Taking this route -- which the agency started to do with apnea -- is easier than embarking on a full federal rulemaking process, which can take years, requires even more extensive input from the public and industry, and often triggers long legal battles.Rather than taking the chance that FMCSA might resurrect its proposal on apnea screening, industry lobbyists approached allies in Congress to write a law that would require the agency to follow the longer, more cumbersome formal rulemaking course.Trucking industry lobbyists sold the bill as a safety enhancement. In their telling, it sounded like truckers were asking regulators to come up with a way to screen for dangerous apnea, not blocking an effort to enhance screenings.Members of Congress bought the spin. ""I can only hope that the agency, which has a long docket, in fact gets to this rulemaking,"" said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) in a brief discussion on the the House floor. ""I'm not sure why the agency was going to do guidance instead, but this is a very important issue. There have been accidents attributed to sleep apnea.""Then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) allowed the bill's sponsors to bring it to the floor on Sept. 26, 2013, when the country was focused on the prospect of a looming government shutdown in the next four days. Safety advocates had little opportunity to raise objections. The bill passed with no opposition and was sent to the Senate. It passed the upper chamber a week later, in the middle of the shutdown, with no debate or even a roll-call vote. The legislation was slipped into a string of unanimous consent requests, lost among resolutions supporting democracy in Venezuela and recognizing Danish Holocaust survivors. President Barack Obama signed the law on Oct. 15, without comment, just before the government shutdown ended.Less than two months later, the Metro-North engineer took a curve along the Hudson River in the Bronx at 82 miles per hour -- 52 mph over the limit -- while he dozed at the controls. Seven cars derailed. Three of the four people killed were ejected from the train. No one noticed that Congress had just made it more difficult to screen truckers for similar sleep disorders.Congress Waters Down Safety RulesHorrifying crashes have a way of focusing Congress' attention on safety -- at least while the headlines are bold and the corpses are fresh. The rest of the time, lawmakers tend to listen to industry groups, which warn of job losses and higher costs if their demands aren't met. These conversations happen inside the cloister of legislative process, shielded from scrutiny. If what business wants doesn't put health or safety first -- and it often doesn't -- politicians try to meet the demand by adding provisions to much larger legislative vehicles, where they may be impossible to dislodge, if they are even discovered at all.Consider this example.In July 2013, the FMCSA enacted a regulation modifying an existing rule that says drivers must take 34 hours off after they hit certain maximum time limits working and driving. The new restriction mandated that truckers include two nights in that break, with no driving between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. The new rule effectively cut the maximum hours drivers could work from 82 per week to 70. Studies show that humans get the best, most restorative rest while slumbering at night, and truckers face especially tough schedules, so the restriction forced drivers to have two restful, overnight periods in their break, which is known as a ""restart.""But trucking lobbyists argued that making drivers sleep at night was more dangerous because it would put more trucks on the road in the morning hours, with commuters and school buses. The industry pointed to data that shows more accidents occur when there are more vehicles on the roads during the day. The lobbyists neglected to mention data showing that the rate of fatal accidents actually more than doubles during the overnight hours, even with vastly fewer automobiles on the roads.As soon as the updated regulation went into effect, trucking groups demanded changes, but FMCSA, which had spent years working on the rule, wasn't listening. That left the industry with the choice of pursuing an uncertain challenge in the courts, or appealing to Congress for relief.By law, Congress can vote to disapprove a new executive agency regulation, such as the sleep rule, within 60 work days of the rule's publication. If Congress doesn't pass a disapproval resolution, lawmakers can propose specific legislation undoing the new rule, and hold hearings on the proposal in the relevant committee -- in this case, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.Going through either of those processes is the transparent, above-board approach. But that path does not often get the trucking industry what it wants. For years, the late New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D), a member of the commerce committee, blocked anything that he thought eroded highway safety, as did other safety-conscious members on the committee. Lautenberg's successor, Sen. Cory Booker (D), has sought to take up that mantle.The trucking industry needed a detour. It looked for an alternate route through the Senate Appropriations Committee, and found Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who represents the trucking-friendly state of Maine. Collins added a provision temporarily barring FMCSA from spending any money to enforce its new rule and requiring additional study of the issue to a $54 billion transportation bill during an untelevised legislative markup in June 2014.The under-the-radar move might have been the end of the new rule. But unlike with the apnea bill a year before, a headline-grabbing tragedy caught the nation's attention shortly before the appropriations bill made it to the full Senate. Two days after Collins got her amendment included, an exhausted Walmart truck driver speeding along the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into comedian Tracy Morgan's limo. The wreck killed Morgan’s friend James McNair and left Morgan and four others severely injured. The crash generated headlines around the world, and once again focused the nation’s attention on the dangers of sleep-deprived drivers behind the wheels of 80,000-pound vehicles.When the transportation spending bill came to the Senate floor on June 19, Booker was waiting with his own amendment to block that of Collins. He took up his microphone and delivered a blistering speech against the provision, forcing Collins to defend the measure. But before the bill went to a vote, Senate leaders pulled the measure from consideration, in part because of the sudden controversy.Collins didn’t give up, though. When the nation was again facing a government shutdown in the winter, she managed to slip her sleep-rule provision into the so-called CRomnibus, a huge, unwieldy spending measure that needed to pass by Dec. 13 to keep the government open. No one outside of Congress knew that the trucking provision had been attached to the bill until lawmakers shoved their shambling creation into the light on Dec. 9, four days before it needed to pass. At that point, the measure could not be blocked, as it had been in the aftermath of Tracy Morgan's crash. Like the sleep apnea rule a year before, it passed under the cover of a funding battle, much to the disappointment of safety advocates, including Morgan's lawyer, Benedict Morelli.""I don't understand how in good conscience anybody could be pushing to relax the federal rules,"" Morelli said. ""The reason that they’ve been put in place is to make sure this doesn’t happen -- and it happens a lot.""Shocking Headlines, Shockingly OftenMorelli is right: Accidents like those that nearly killed Balder and Morgan happen with startling regularity. For instance, last spring while Congress was again quietly targeting trucking regulations, a string of crashes showed vividly the consequences of overtired truckers pushing past their limits.On April 22, 2015 a truck driven by John Wayne Johnson barreled through a line of cars backed up by an earlier truck crash on Interstate 16 in Georgia. Johnson killed five nursing students from Georgia Southern University headed to their last training shift of the year. Lawsuits filed over the wreck say he had sleep apnea and a history of falling asleep at the wheel. He also may have been looking at pornographic pictures.On May 19, witnesses saw a tractor-trailer drifting between lanes as it neared a construction zone on that same Georgia interstate, near I-95. The driver, David Gibbons, 61, smashed his rig into the stopped cars and also killed five people.On June 25, Benjamin Brewer, 39, spent 50 hours at work and was allegedly high on meth when he approached construction traffic on I-75 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was going so fast, his truck careened on for 453 feet after impacting the first car, according to the NTSB. He killed six people.On July 23, trucker Ruslan Pankiv failed to notice traffic backed up at a construction zone on I-65 near Lafayette, Indiana. He plowed through the stopped vehicles, killing five people, including a mother, her two young sons and himself. Again, police suspected fatigue.Those are just cases for which drowsiness was explicitly stated as a possible cause. Most independent experts believe fatigue-related wrecks are significantly undercounted since there is no roadside exam or blood test for drowsiness, and drivers are often reluctant to admit they were nodding off.In the case of Renato Velasquez, he insisted he hadn't dozed off, but he could come up with no other explanation his wreck. By the time the scientifically careful NTSB released its final report on Velasquez's accident, on Feb. 9, 2016, he'd already been convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for driving while fatigued, ignoring federal rest rules, driving too fast and failing to yield.What's beyond debate is that hauling loads across America's highways is a draining, exhausting existence. And it's only gotten tougher since President Jimmy Carter and Congress deregulated the complex rules governing the economic side of the industry in 1980, making it much easier for new companies to get into the business and setting off a surge in competition.The change was good for consumers, who saw shipping prices drop as lower-cost carriers pushed out unionized firms. And safety did not immediately suffer, because technology improved and both the government and carriers grew more conscious of the practices that reduce the risk of crashes.But as unions vanished and the need for productivity and efficiency rose, pay for truck drivers plummeted. They now make less than they did in the late 1970s when wages are adjusted for inflation. And there are now tens of thousands of small, poorly financed new trucking companies that have great incentive to push drivers as hard as they can.Those drivers, who are often independent and own their own rigs, have to cope with managers' demands and all the safety rules that still exist, even as the close-to-the-bone industry leaves little room for error. Unpredictable hours, uncertain traffic, long stretches spent sitting alone behind a wheel, and meals that depend on roadside greasy spoons take a toll on drivers' health. All that adds up to a circumstance that encourages drivers -- especially the growing number who have strict drop-off and pick-up times set in their contracts -- to take chances. And they do, frequently ignoring rest rules to make their schedules. Drivers for smaller outfits are especially likely to break the rules.Renato Velasquez is a case in point.His daughter Yesenia told NTSB investigators that her father had dreamed of driving big rigs. He had been a bus driver in rural Mexico, transporting workers to farms back in the '80s. He immigrated to the United States, and in 2007 earned his commercial driver's license in Illinois. His first job driving flatbeds was at a company called M&A, where his brother worked, and where he learned the federal safety rules.Velasquez told the NTSB he took a job with another firm, DND International, in 2011, after meeting the company's manager, Dimitar Dimitrievsky. The company, one of thousands of small-time shipping operations that have proliferated since deregulation, employed 49 drivers. Those drivers logged 5.4 million miles in 2013, the year before Velasquez's crash.Velasquez seldom saw the boss, or any other workers, and was dispatched remotely, according to his interview with federal investigators. He and another driver said they would drop off their logbooks and other records at a box outside Dimitrievsky's house once a week. There appeared to be little oversight or enforcement at the company, the NTSB concluded. Although Velasquez said he never got safety training from his employer, records say that he received at least a little, and the company did possess some of the required safety training materials. But DND also possessed a terrible, albeit remarkably common, safety record.In the two years before the crash, DND drivers had been subjected to 289 inspections, according to federal records. Its drivers had been ordered off the roads 27 times, most often for hours-of-service violations -- driving more than the legal limit. The vehicles themselves were found to be in violation 26 times in 131 inspections, a failure rate of 20 percent. The company racked up seven crashes between March 2012 and January 2014, causing one fatality and four injuries. Those stats meant that DND had alerts in two Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASICs) that the FMCSA uses to rate companies and identify dangerous carriers. BASIC serves as the foundation for the agency's Safety Measurement System -- a system that the trucking industry despises. DND had poor scores in the BASIC standards for safe driving and driver fatigue. The chances of a firm being involved in a fatal crash jump by 93 percent when it has an alert on unsafe driving and by 83 percent when it has received a warning for excessive hours-of-service violations, according to agency data. And firms with two alerts have crash rates that are double the average among companies with no alerts.Independent drivers like Velasquez and his colleagues are paid by the load, not by the number of hours they work. A decent living requires good loads. To get good loads, a trucker needs a strong relationship with his trucking company's dispatchers, who take orders from shipping brokers and route them to available tractors. Trips that are longer, more time-consuming or force the driver to return empty -- hauling ""flying canaries"" or ""dispatcher brains"" -- can even cost a driver money. A DND driver named Stanford Dean told NTSB investigators that his loads weren't even dispatched in the United States. They came from someone based in Macedonia.""Do you know how difficult it is to make money?"" Dean asked investigators who confronted him over discrepancies in his logbooks. ""I'm a safe guy, but there's issues sometimes,"" Dean added. ""There's so many obstacles. If anybody tells you they roll 100 percent by the book, they're lying to you.""On Velasquez's fateful run, he had a decent assignment from the dispatchers, hauling power cables approximately 450 miles from Illinois to Nebraska, for a $1,600 fee. On the way back he would stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to pick up three steel coils that he would haul a little more than 200 miles back toward home, for a fee of $550. After gas, tolls and DND's 20 percent cut, he would pocket about $1,000 for the out-and-back.According to Velasquez's logbook for the trip that killed Vincent Petrella, he followed safety rules. It says Velasquez left Hanover Park at 11:45 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 26, carrying a 6,707-pound load of cable to the Omaha Public Power District in Elkhorn, Nebraska. The entries say he reached Des Moines, Iowa, at about 5:30 p.m., took a 45-minute break, then motored on to Elkhorn by 9 p.m., keeping his driving time well inside the 11-hour limit and his on-duty hours within the 14 permitted in a day.But Velasquez's logbook was a work of fiction.Investigators would later learn how badly things went wrong for Velasquez, and how severely he broke the rules, leading to his deadly exhaustion.Velasquez's cell phone and toll records showed he didn't set out on the trip until nearly six hours after the time he recorded in his logbook, and he kept driving well past the time that he claimed he had settled in for a night's rest.The problem was that this was a trip across the Midwest in the dead of winter, with a brutal deep freeze, snow, fog and whipping winds along the way. Ahead of Velasquez on I-88, two other trucks crashed at 9:43 p.m. in whiteout conditions, shutting down the highway for four hours. Velasquez wasn't even out of Illinois at that point, and that traffic jam may have been his only rest in 37 hours. According to the truck's engine records retrieved by the NTSB, the longest it was idle that Sunday night and early Monday morning was for less than three hours.Velasquez couldn't just pull in for some extra rest after the long night. A requirement of the delivery contract with the Omaha Public Power District was a punctual drop-off at 8:30 in morning. The driver logged in at the drop-off at 8:45 a.m. Records showed Velasquez departing at 9:20 for a 300-mile run to Cedar Rapids, where his pickup window for the three steel coils began at 4 p.m. He left at 5:15 with another 200-plus miles and four hours left to reach home.But about an hour before he got that far, a truck that hauled containers from railways broke down ahead of him in Aurora, Illinois, just shy of Velasquez's destination. It was owned by a firm called Michael's Cartage that had alerts in four of the FMCSA's troubling categories, including maintenance. Its drivers falsified work logs more than half of the time, according to an NTSB review. Just like with DND International, the numbers suggested the carrier was more than twice as likely to wind up in a crash. In this case, the Cartage truck became the hazard that Velasquez failed to avoid.He never wrote down his final stop, at 9:20 p.m. -- when he dozed off at the wheel and forever changed Doug Balder's life. Paying For InfluenceThe leader of the trucking industry's campaign to tilt federal regulations in its favor is an alliance of the nation's largest shippers called the Coalition for Efficient and Responsible Trucking, or CERT. Its most prominent members are FedEx and UPS.Members of CERT have donated more than $13 million to federal election campaigns since 2012, and spent $80 million on well-connected lobbyists, according to a Public Citizen study from 2015 using data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as well HuffPost's analysis of more recent congressional lobbying reports through the rest of the year. The American Trucking Associations, which advocates on behalf of the industry, spent another $8 million on lobbying and $2.4 million on elections. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, another industry group, has chipped in $3.5 million for lobbying and $790,000 on campaigns. It amounts to more than $20 million spent each year, solely to influence Congress.Trucking industry lobbyists have the kind of access to decision-makers that safety advocates can only imagine. Among FedEx lobbyists alone, 37 of 51 previously worked in government, according to CRP.Those influence brokers have been exceptionally busy and effective, securing victories on apnea screening in 2013 and the roll-back of sleep rules in 2014. In 2015, they aimed for much more. In the House, industry-friendly lawmakers were persuaded to add several policy riders to the annual transportation funding bill for 2016 in May, again bypassing committees and hearings, as Sen. Collins did with sleep rules.Bigger And More DangerousPerhaps the most controversial of those measures was a scheme to take away the ability of states to set their own standards for the maximum lengths of double trailers. A federal law passed in 1982 required all states to allow doubles, with each of those trailers up to 28 feet long. Many states, particularly in the West, allow longer trailers. The new measure would have raised the federal limit to 33 feet for each trailer, and forced all states to accept them.Companies such as FedEx and UPS have long sought to extend the length of trailers, because they often fill the 28-foot model with packages before hitting the 80,000-pound weight limit. Carrying more with each rig means greater efficiency, lower cost and more profit.But larger, heavier trucks also mean more wear and tear on highways and bridges that are already poorly maintained. Weigh stations and other facilities handling trucks would also need to be renovated and expanded, often at taxpayers' expense.Law enforcement and safety advocates also warn that double trailers are already more dangerous than regular semis, with an 11 percent higher crash fatality rate.“From a safety perspective, double 33-foot trailers are basically a disaster,"" said Robert Mills, a Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who spent 13 years as a roadside safety inspector and is a member of the Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee, which recommends rules to the federal government. Many truckers are not so pleased with the giant double trailers either, dubbing them ""wiggle wagons"" and ""widow makers."" Some haulers, including the smaller conglomerates Swift and Knight, joined with the Coalition Against Bigger Trucks to oppose their larger brethren's push to extend trailer lengths. Even crashes of doubles where there are no injuries in the initial impact leave dangerous scenes for other drivers when they're sprawled out across multiple lanes of traffic, said Balder, who is now working with the coalition.But CERT, the coalition of shippers, is determined to get approval for larger trucks, and was behind a push in 2012 requiring the Department of Transportation to study the impacts of size and weight increases. The industry coalition believed, or at least argued, that those impacts would be negligible; research proving that would help their case. But before that study was even completed, the coalition got its provision allowing longer trucks added to the House's version of the 2016 transportation spending bill. The DOT study, released in June 2015 two weeks after the House released the transportation bill, recommended against allowing larger trucks, saying the safety issues remained unresolved.There were several other industry requests in that funding bill for 2016, including a measure that aimed to extend the suspension of sleep rules that Collins had won just six months earlier. Her suspension lasted a year and required regulators to look into the effectiveness of requiring two nights of sleep and whether there was any case for the trucking industry's position. But rather than see that process through, the new provision changed the study mid-stream and called for gathering even more data — including the regulation's impact on the longevity of drivers. Studying workers' lifespans, of course, takes entire lifespans. That provision was signed into law with the 2016 spending bill that ultimately passed.“They just basically want to stall this forever,"" said Rep. David Price (N.C.), the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that deals with transportation.Another measure the industry pushed last year aimed to short-circuit federal regulators' efforts to evaluate raising insurance requirements for trucking companies. Currently, carriers have to maintain the same $750,000 policies they did in the '80s. The industry’s argument is that independent operators would not be able to afford higher premiums -- and indeed, DND's margins were so close it shut down when its insurance company raised rates after the Balder crash. The industry argues that 99 percent of truck accidents do not generate such high damages. But $750,000 doesn't begin to cover the costs a serious semi wreck incurs. For instance, a widower whose wife was killed and children severely injured by a dozing driver in 2010 won $41 million in damages. The family of James McNair, the comedian who died in the Tracy Morgan crash, settled for $10 million in March last year. A somewhat weakened version of the measure did pass, requiring regulators to evaluate a number of different factors before they adjust the insurance requirements.Another industry-backed provision aimed to hide the BASIC safety measurements for trucking companies from public view, and bar their use in lawsuits. The lawsuit provision was dropped from the spending bill during negotiations, but the BASIC scores were in fact hidden and removed from the agency's website. The industry used a Government Accountability Office study that found the safety system could do better in some respects to justify its position, but the two firms involved in the Velasquez crash had exactly the sort of poor safety scores that the BASIC system predicts make them more likely to be involved in accidents.Despite the fact that these provisions will likely have an impact on the safety of nearly 11 million large trucks registered in America, they were all buried in legislation that Congress had to pass to avoid a government shutdown, with little to no debate about whether they were a good idea.""The advocates of relaxing the rules or eliminating the rules, they see that and think this is their train to catch. ... Not just wait on the normal process, or count on something as pedestrian as actual hearings or discussion, but to make a summary judgement and latch it on to an appropriations bill,"" Price said.There's something else all the industry-backed measures have in common: They are deeply unpopular.The Huffington Post and YouGov surveyed Americans on four of the proposals the industry has been pursuing through the backdoor: teen drivers, longer trucks, heavier trucks, and the relaxed hours-of-service rules. In every case, respondents to the survey opposed the moves -- by large margins.Indeed, when proposals to weaken trucking safety do get a up-or-down vote on their own, they generally fail. When the Senate's version of the transportation funding bill came up for debate in November and October, an attempt to include the House's requirement for states to accept 33-foot trailers across the nation was voted down each time. Similarly, an attempt in the House last November to amend the highway construction bill to hike truck weight limits failed convincingly, 187 to 236.The trucking industry is certainly still trying, though. The backdoor approach is the easiest way for the industry to get around the safety restrictions that most Americans support. One initiative that it backed down on in 2015 was a bid to block states from enforcing regulations on rest and pay that are tougher than the federal government's. Large haulers got the preemption added to the House's highway construction bill, but couldn't get senators to consent.The trucking industry is back at it this year, adding a provision that would override state rest and overtime pay rules to a House bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration, which is currently operating on a stopgap measure that expires in mid-July. The Senate is working on a dramatically different version of that bill, which almost guarantees a situation where trucking lobbyists have thrived -- a rush to finish a must-pass bill behind closed doors with a looming deadline and little ability to alter deeply buried provisions.A Problem He Can't ForgetFor Douglas Balder, crashes are not just a byproduct of business and politics. His own near-fatal encounter is burned into his flesh and his memory.While he can't forget it, he also doesn't want to. He's read most of the 5,000-page NTSB investigation of his crash, and he still looks at the pictures of his destroyed squad car every couple of weeks. He said he doesn't know why he wants to keep replaying that night. ""I’ve been asked that question before, and I can’t answer it,"" he said.But he does have an answer, really.Balder joined the Navy reserves right after graduating high school in 1994 and has served tours overseas, including in Iraq and North Africa. He is the sort of person who walks in the St. Jude's parade and donates blood. And he now has another reason to keep trying -- a third child who was conceived and born after he was nearly killed on the side of that highway.""We all take an oath to make things better in the long run,"" he said. ""And it’s got to be our focus now. I could easily have shriveled up in a ball and stayed at home and wasted away, but that’s not my mindset. That’s the military in me: You gotta move on -- pick up and move on -- and try to make a difference for the future. And I have to remind myself of what happened."""

He was about to be set on fire.Balder had stopped to assist a Chicago-bound big rig that had stalled out in the rightmost lane of the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway. A heavy-duty tow truck and a bright yellow Tollway assistance vehicle were also pulled over, attending to the stranded semi.Balder, a Navy reservist and father of two, had his heater cranked against minus-30-degree wind chill. He had positioned his 2011 Crown Victoria behind the Tollway vehicle and switched on his flashers. There were also flares sputtering on the pavement, and the Tollway truck was flashing a large blinking arrow and its amber hazard lights. Visibility on that clear, cold night was excellent -- around 10 miles.Renato Velasquez, who was barreling toward the stopped vehicles in a flatbed big rig loaded with three massive rolls of steel, didn't see Balder's flashers. He didn't see the pulsing arrow or the flares. He didn’t change lanes or take any evasive action until far too late. Velasquez was falling asleep, a court would find later. His truck rammed into Balder's squad car at 63 miles per hour, according to the National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the accident. The impact crushed the Crown Vic’s trunk, exploding the gas tank and catapulting the patrol car into a roadside ditch. The three 14,580-pound steel coils chained to Velazquez's trailer bed burst their restraints. One of the massive rolls struck the cab of the Tollway vehicle, instantly killing its 39-year-old driver Vincent Petrella and injuring Agron Xhelaj, the driver of the stalled truck who was seated beside him. Balder had lost consciousness when his face hit the steering wheel.""I woke up a short time later on fire,” he said. “Literally on fire. Burning alive.”In that moment, Balder didn't know exactly what had happened. His squad car was half collapsed. The detonated gas tank was spraying fuel and flames through his cab. His only clear thoughts were of survival and of his wife of 14 years, Kimberlie. He yelled out her name.“A certain degree of that was emotion at the moment, knowing that I might die, screaming to the last person you might love,” he said.Balder needed to find a way to escape if he was ever going to see his wife and kids again.He tried to start his engine, then tried to radio for help. Fire was spreading from around the partition behind him, burning his back, head and legs. He couldn't open his door or window. He tried the switches on his armrest, and the passenger window miraculously cranked down.“As that cold air came in and swirled that air around, adrenaline set in, and I flew out,” he said. “The only other choice was to sit there and die.”He tumbled out on the roadside, rolling in the snow to extinguish the flames that had already scorched more than a third of his body. By the time he stumbled around the back of the wreck and back up to the road, local police were arriving to help.“You got this guy walking up with his skin hanging off his arm,"" Balder said. ""My pants were all burned off to the skin.”He spent six weeks in a medically induced coma, three months in the hospital, and needed 10 surgeries and extensive, ongoing rehab to recover.Increasing Carnage On Our HighwaysIn the two years since the accident, Balder has had plenty of time to think about what happened to him -- and why. On the simplest level, it happened because a criminally negligent driver pushed too hard and crashed. But it is also part of a broader trend of declining safety on the roads after decades of progress -- a trend that the United States Congress has aided and abetted by loosening safety rules even as both truck drivers and trucks are being pushed to their limits, just like Renato Velasquez.Truck-related deaths hit an all-time low during the economic doldrums of 2009, when 2,983 truck accidents killed 3,380 people. But as the economy has recovered, the carnage has been on the rise. In 2013, the most recent year for which finalized statistics are available, 3,541 wrecks killed 3,964 people -- an increase of 17.3 percent in just four years. In 2014, the number of deaths resulting from truck accidents was down slightly, but the total number of crashes and injuries increased.At the same time, Congress has been caving, very quietly, to lobbying from trucking interests that want to roll back, block or modify at least a half-dozen important safety regulations. Significant parts of the hauling industry have long opposed many of the federal rules governing working hours, rest periods, size and weight limits, and safety standards. When the Great Recession began in 2008, profit margins for shippers shrank and bankruptcies rose, prompting a desperate industry to step up its lobbying effort. Perhaps, the trucking companies' lobbyists suggested to Congress, trucks could haul loads heavier than the federal 80,000-pound limit, which would allow them to deliver more goods with each truck. Maybe they could have longer double trailers, increasing the limit from 28 feet for each unit to 33 feet -- turning each rig into an 80-foot-long behemoth, as long as an eight-story building is tall. Or they could let truck drivers be more flexible with their rest breaks, which would allow them to work up to 82 hours a week instead of the already-exhausting limit of 70. Maybe trucking firms could reduce labor costs by hiring lower-paid drivers, younger than 21 -- as young as 18. Maybe they could stop federal regulators from raising insurance requirements that were set during the Reagan administration. Maybe the federal motor carrier safety ratings for unsafe trucking companies could be kept secret.Indeed, the trucking industry is trying to do all of those things. If they are successful, these changes would amount to the most significant overhaul of highway safety rules in decades. But most people don't know such sweeping revisions are even being considered.Asleep At The WheelThe latest round of congressional wrangling started with a fight over snoring, or, more specifically, the obstructive sleep apnea that causes it.For decades, mounting evidence has shown that sleep apnea, a common disorder, can cause perilous levels of fatigue in drivers, pilots, train engineers and others who need to remain alert at work. The airways of people who suffer from apnea close repeatedly while they sleep, interrupting their breathing dozens of times an hour. They often don't notice the interruptions, but it leaves them exhausted and prone to doze off during the day. Behind the wheel of a large, speeding vehicle, the results are predictably catastrophic. It's not just a problem for truckers. As investigators sorted through a Dec. 1, 2013, Metro-North commuter train derailment in New York that killed four people, they found the engineer at the controls, William Rockefeller, had fallen asleep. His shift had recently been changed, which can cause sleep problems in itself, but he also had undiagnosed sleep apnea. Since 2008, experts with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates the trucking industry, have recommended that drivers get checked for the condition and treated if necessary. The NTSB lists sleep apnea as a problem across the transportation industry, and often points to the Metro-North wreck as evidence of why the trucking industry in particular needs better regulation -- its rules are the weakest of the major transportation sectors.The risk of apnea rises dramatically with weight gain, and approximately two-thirds of all truck drivers are believed to be obese, according to a recent federal survey. Other studies have also found that truckers are much more likely to be overweight than workers in other fields. And extensive research links sleep deprivation to heightened crash risks; even moderate tiredness can impair a driver as much as being legally intoxicated. A recent Harvard study found truck drivers with obstructive sleep apnea are five times more likely to crash than their fellows.To do a better job dealing with the issue, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration floated a proposal in April 2012 that would have required overweight truckers to get checked for sleep apnea. The industry was livid. Some drivers claimed there was no evidence that sleep apnea raised the risk of crashes, while others alleged the proposal was a scheme to enrich sleep doctors.Independent truckers are especially loath to admit a problem because treatment can take them off the road for a month or more. And sleep tests and treatment cost thousands of dollars for people with inadequate or no health insurance.Despite acknowledging the problem and the need to deal with it, FMCSA backed off its push to update the apnea rules. Just a week after posting the proposal, the agency withdrew it, claiming it was published in error.Going After CongressThe trucking industry did not let the matter drop, though. Instead, its lobbyists launched a pre-emptive strike.Normally, when an agency like FMCSA targets a specific issue, it uses its existing authority to propose binding guidance. Taking this route -- which the agency started to do with apnea -- is easier than embarking on a full federal rulemaking process, which can take years, requires even more extensive input from the public and industry, and often triggers long legal battles.Rather than taking the chance that FMCSA might resurrect its proposal on apnea screening, industry lobbyists approached allies in Congress to write a law that would require the agency to follow the longer, more cumbersome formal rulemaking course.Trucking industry lobbyists sold the bill as a safety enhancement. In their telling, it sounded like truckers were asking regulators to come up with a way to screen for dangerous apnea, not blocking an effort to enhance screenings.Members of Congress bought the spin. ""I can only hope that the agency, which has a long docket, in fact gets to this rulemaking,"" said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) in a brief discussion on the the House floor. ""I'm not sure why the agency was going to do guidance instead, but this is a very important issue. There have been accidents attributed to sleep apnea.""Then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) allowed the bill's sponsors to bring it to the floor on Sept. 26, 2013, when the country was focused on the prospect of a looming government shutdown in the next four days. Safety advocates had little opportunity to raise objections. The bill passed with no opposition and was sent to the Senate. It passed the upper chamber a week later, in the middle of the shutdown, with no debate or even a roll-call vote. The legislation was slipped into a string of unanimous consent requests, lost among resolutions supporting democracy in Venezuela and recognizing Danish Holocaust survivors. President Barack Obama signed the law on Oct. 15, without comment, just before the government shutdown ended.Less than two months later, the Metro-North engineer took a curve along the Hudson River in the Bronx at 82 miles per hour -- 52 mph over the limit -- while he dozed at the controls. Seven cars derailed. Three of the four people killed were ejected from the train. No one noticed that Congress had just made it more difficult to screen truckers for similar sleep disorders.Congress Waters Down Safety RulesHorrifying crashes have a way of focusing Congress' attention on safety -- at least while the headlines are bold and the corpses are fresh. The rest of the time, lawmakers tend to listen to industry groups, which warn of job losses and higher costs if their demands aren't met. These conversations happen inside the cloister of legislative process, shielded from scrutiny. If what business wants doesn't put health or safety first -- and it often doesn't -- politicians try to meet the demand by adding provisions to much larger legislative vehicles, where they may be impossible to dislodge, if they are even discovered at all.Consider this example.In July 2013, the FMCSA enacted a regulation modifying an existing rule that says drivers must take 34 hours off after they hit certain maximum time limits working and driving. The new restriction mandated that truckers include two nights in that break, with no driving between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. The new rule effectively cut the maximum hours drivers could work from 82 per week to 70. Studies show that humans get the best, most restorative rest while slumbering at night, and truckers face especially tough schedules, so the restriction forced drivers to have two restful, overnight periods in their break, which is known as a ""restart.""But trucking lobbyists argued that making drivers sleep at night was more dangerous because it would put more trucks on the road in the morning hours, with commuters and school buses. The industry pointed to data that shows more accidents occur when there are more vehicles on the roads during the day. The lobbyists neglected to mention data showing that the rate of fatal accidents actually more than doubles during the overnight hours, even with vastly fewer automobiles on the roads.As soon as the updated regulation went into effect, trucking groups demanded changes, but FMCSA, which had spent years working on the rule, wasn't listening. That left the industry with the choice of pursuing an uncertain challenge in the courts, or appealing to Congress for relief.By law, Congress can vote to disapprove a new executive agency regulation, such as the sleep rule, within 60 work days of the rule's publication. If Congress doesn't pass a disapproval resolution, lawmakers can propose specific legislation undoing the new rule, and hold hearings on the proposal in the relevant committee -- in this case, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.Going through either of those processes is the transparent, above-board approach. But that path does not often get the trucking industry what it wants. For years, the late New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D), a member of the commerce committee, blocked anything that he thought eroded highway safety, as did other safety-conscious members on the committee. Lautenberg's successor, Sen. Cory Booker (D), has sought to take up that mantle.The trucking industry needed a detour. It looked for an alternate route through the Senate Appropriations Committee, and found Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who represents the trucking-friendly state of Maine. Collins added a provision temporarily barring FMCSA from spending any money to enforce its new rule and requiring additional study of the issue to a $54 billion transportation bill during an untelevised legislative markup in June 2014.The under-the-radar move might have been the end of the new rule. But unlike with the apnea bill a year before, a headline-grabbing tragedy caught the nation's attention shortly before the appropriations bill made it to the full Senate. Two days after Collins got her amendment included, an exhausted Walmart truck driver speeding along the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into comedian Tracy Morgan's limo. The wreck killed Morgan’s friend James McNair and left Morgan and four others severely injured. The crash generated headlines around the world, and once again focused the nation’s attention on the dangers of sleep-deprived drivers behind the wheels of 80,000-pound vehicles.When the transportation spending bill came to the Senate floor on June 19, Booker was waiting with his own amendment to block that of Collins. He took up his microphone and delivered a blistering speech against the provision, forcing Collins to defend the measure. But before the bill went to a vote, Senate leaders pulled the measure from consideration, in part because of the sudden controversy.Collins didn’t give up, though. When the nation was again facing a government shutdown in the winter, she managed to slip her sleep-rule provision into the so-called CRomnibus, a huge, unwieldy spending measure that needed to pass by Dec. 13 to keep the government open. No one outside of Congress knew that the trucking provision had been attached to the bill until lawmakers shoved their shambling creation into the light on Dec. 9, four days before it needed to pass. At that point, the measure could not be blocked, as it had been in the aftermath of Tracy Morgan's crash. Like the sleep apnea rule a year before, it passed under the cover of a funding battle, much to the disappointment of safety advocates, including Morgan's lawyer, Benedict Morelli.""I don't understand how in good conscience anybody could be pushing to relax the federal rules,"" Morelli said. ""The reason that they’ve been put in place is to make sure this doesn’t happen -- and it happens a lot.""Shocking Headlines, Shockingly OftenMorelli is right: Accidents like those that nearly killed Balder and Morgan happen with startling regularity. For instance, last spring while Congress was again quietly targeting trucking regulations, a string of crashes showed vividly the consequences of overtired truckers pushing past their limits.On April 22, 2015 a truck driven by John Wayne Johnson barreled through a line of cars backed up by an earlier truck crash on Interstate 16 in Georgia. Johnson killed five nursing students from Georgia Southern University headed to their last training shift of the year. Lawsuits filed over the wreck say he had sleep apnea and a history of falling asleep at the wheel. He also may have been looking at pornographic pictures.On May 19, witnesses saw a tractor-trailer drifting between lanes as it neared a construction zone on that same Georgia interstate, near I-95. The driver, David Gibbons, 61, smashed his rig into the stopped cars and also killed five people.On June 25, Benjamin Brewer, 39, spent 50 hours at work and was allegedly high on meth when he approached construction traffic on I-75 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was going so fast, his truck careened on for 453 feet after impacting the first car, according to the NTSB. He killed six people.On July 23, trucker Ruslan Pankiv failed to notice traffic backed up at a construction zone on I-65 near Lafayette, Indiana. He plowed through the stopped vehicles, killing five people, including a mother, her two young sons and himself. Again, police suspected fatigue.Those are just cases for which drowsiness was explicitly stated as a possible cause. Most independent experts believe fatigue-related wrecks are significantly undercounted since there is no roadside exam or blood test for drowsiness, and drivers are often reluctant to admit they were nodding off.In the case of Renato Velasquez, he insisted he hadn't dozed off, but he could come up with no other explanation his wreck. By the time the scientifically careful NTSB released its final report on Velasquez's accident, on Feb. 9, 2016, he'd already been convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for driving while fatigued, ignoring federal rest rules, driving too fast and failing to yield.What's beyond debate is that hauling loads across America's highways is a draining, exhausting existence. And it's only gotten tougher since President Jimmy Carter and Congress deregulated the complex rules governing the economic side of the industry in 1980, making it much easier for new companies to get into the business and setting off a surge in competition.The change was good for consumers, who saw shipping prices drop as lower-cost carriers pushed out unionized firms. And safety did not immediately suffer, because technology improved and both the government and carriers grew more conscious of the practices that reduce the risk of crashes.But as unions vanished and the need for productivity and efficiency rose, pay for truck drivers plummeted. They now make less than they did in the late 1970s when wages are adjusted for inflation. And there are now tens of thousands of small, poorly financed new trucking companies that have great incentive to push drivers as hard as they can.Those drivers, who are often independent and own their own rigs, have to cope with managers' demands and all the safety rules that still exist, even as the close-to-the-bone industry leaves little room for error. Unpredictable hours, uncertain traffic, long stretches spent sitting alone behind a wheel, and meals that depend on roadside greasy spoons take a toll on drivers' health. All that adds up to a circumstance that encourages drivers -- especially the growing number who have strict drop-off and pick-up times set in their contracts -- to take chances. And they do, frequently ignoring rest rules to make their schedules. Drivers for smaller outfits are especially likely to break the rules.Renato Velasquez is a case in point.His daughter Yesenia told NTSB investigators that her father had dreamed of driving big rigs. He had been a bus driver in rural Mexico, transporting workers to farms back in the '80s. He immigrated to the United States, and in 2007 earned his commercial driver's license in Illinois. His first job driving flatbeds was at a company called M&A, where his brother worked, and where he learned the federal safety rules.Velasquez told the NTSB he took a job with another firm, DND International, in 2011, after meeting the company's manager, Dimitar Dimitrievsky. The company, one of thousands of small-time shipping operations that have proliferated since deregulation, employed 49 drivers. Those drivers logged 5.4 million miles in 2013, the year before Velasquez's crash.Velasquez seldom saw the boss, or any other workers, and was dispatched remotely, according to his interview with federal investigators. He and another driver said they would drop off their logbooks and other records at a box outside Dimitrievsky's house once a week. There appeared to be little oversight or enforcement at the company, the NTSB concluded. Although Velasquez said he never got safety training from his employer, records say that he received at least a little, and the company did possess some of the required safety training materials. But DND also possessed a terrible, albeit remarkably common, safety record.In the two years before the crash, DND drivers had been subjected to 289 inspections, according to federal records. Its drivers had been ordered off the roads 27 times, most often for hours-of-service violations -- driving more than the legal limit. The vehicles themselves were found to be in violation 26 times in 131 inspections, a failure rate of 20 percent. The company racked up seven crashes between March 2012 and January 2014, causing one fatality and four injuries. Those stats meant that DND had alerts in two Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASICs) that the FMCSA uses to rate companies and identify dangerous carriers. BASIC serves as the foundation for the agency's Safety Measurement System -- a system that the trucking industry despises. DND had poor scores in the BASIC standards for safe driving and driver fatigue. The chances of a firm being involved in a fatal crash jump by 93 percent when it has an alert on unsafe driving and by 83 percent when it has received a warning for excessive hours-of-service violations, according to agency data. And firms with two alerts have crash rates that are double the average among companies with no alerts.Independent drivers like Velasquez and his colleagues are paid by the load, not by the number of hours they work. A decent living requires good loads. To get good loads, a trucker needs a strong relationship with his trucking company's dispatchers, who take orders from shipping brokers and route them to available tractors. Trips that are longer, more time-consuming or force the driver to return empty -- hauling ""flying canaries"" or ""dispatcher brains"" -- can even cost a driver money. A DND driver named Stanford Dean told NTSB investigators that his loads weren't even dispatched in the United States. They came from someone based in Macedonia.""Do you know how difficult it is to make money?"" Dean asked investigators who confronted him over discrepancies in his logbooks. ""I'm a safe guy, but there's issues sometimes,"" Dean added. ""There's so many obstacles. If anybody tells you they roll 100 percent by the book, they're lying to you.""On Velasquez's fateful run, he had a decent assignment from the dispatchers, hauling power cables approximately 450 miles from Illinois to Nebraska, for a $1,600 fee. On the way back he would stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to pick up three steel coils that he would haul a little more than 200 miles back toward home, for a fee of $550. After gas, tolls and DND's 20 percent cut, he would pocket about $1,000 for the out-and-back.According to Velasquez's logbook for the trip that killed Vincent Petrella, he followed safety rules. It says Velasquez left Hanover Park at 11:45 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 26, carrying a 6,707-pound load of cable to the Omaha Public Power District in Elkhorn, Nebraska. The entries say he reached Des Moines, Iowa, at about 5:30 p.m., took a 45-minute break, then motored on to Elkhorn by 9 p.m., keeping his driving time well inside the 11-hour limit and his on-duty hours within the 14 permitted in a day.But Velasquez's logbook was a work of fiction.Investigators would later learn how badly things went wrong for Velasquez, and how severely he broke the rules, leading to his deadly exhaustion.Velasquez's cell phone and toll records showed he didn't set out on the trip until nearly six hours after the time he recorded in his logbook, and he kept driving well past the time that he claimed he had settled in for a night's rest.The problem was that this was a trip across the Midwest in the dead of winter, with a brutal deep freeze, snow, fog and whipping winds along the way. Ahead of Velasquez on I-88, two other trucks crashed at 9:43 p.m. in whiteout conditions, shutting down the highway for four hours. Velasquez wasn't even out of Illinois at that point, and that traffic jam may have been his only rest in 37 hours. According to the truck's engine records retrieved by the NTSB, the longest it was idle that Sunday night and early Monday morning was for less than three hours.Velasquez couldn't just pull in for some extra rest after the long night. A requirement of the delivery contract with the Omaha Public Power District was a punctual drop-off at 8:30 in morning. The driver logged in at the drop-off at 8:45 a.m. Records showed Velasquez departing at 9:20 for a 300-mile run to Cedar Rapids, where his pickup window for the three steel coils began at 4 p.m. He left at 5:15 with another 200-plus miles and four hours left to reach home.But about an hour before he got that far, a truck that hauled containers from railways broke down ahead of him in Aurora, Illinois, just shy of Velasquez's destination. It was owned by a firm called Michael's Cartage that had alerts in four of the FMCSA's troubling categories, including maintenance. Its drivers falsified work logs more than half of the time, according to an NTSB review. Just like with DND International, the numbers suggested the carrier was more than twice as likely to wind up in a crash. In this case, the Cartage truck became the hazard that Velasquez failed to avoid.He never wrote down his final stop, at 9:20 p.m. -- when he dozed off at the wheel and forever changed Doug Balder's life. Paying For InfluenceThe leader of the trucking industry's campaign to tilt federal regulations in its favor is an alliance of the nation's largest shippers called the Coalition for Efficient and Responsible Trucking, or CERT. Its most prominent members are FedEx and UPS.Members of CERT have donated more than $13 million to federal election campaigns since 2012, and spent $80 million on well-connected lobbyists, according to a Public Citizen study from 2015 using data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as well HuffPost's analysis of more recent congressional lobbying reports through the rest of the year. The American Trucking Associations, which advocates on behalf of the industry, spent another $8 million on lobbying and $2.4 million on elections. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, another industry group, has chipped in $3.5 million for lobbying and $790,000 on campaigns. It amounts to more than $20 million spent each year, solely to influence Congress.Trucking industry lobbyists have the kind of access to decision-makers that safety advocates can only imagine. Among FedEx lobbyists alone, 37 of 51 previously worked in government, according to CRP.Those influence brokers have been exceptionally busy and effective, securing victories on apnea screening in 2013 and the roll-back of sleep rules in 2014. In 2015, they aimed for much more. In the House, industry-friendly lawmakers were persuaded to add several policy riders to the annual transportation funding bill for 2016 in May, again bypassing committees and hearings, as Sen. Collins did with sleep rules.Bigger And More DangerousPerhaps the most controversial of those measures was a scheme to take away the ability of states to set their own standards for the maximum lengths of double trailers. A federal law passed in 1982 required all states to allow doubles, with each of those trailers up to 28 feet long. Many states, particularly in the West, allow longer trailers. The new measure would have raised the federal limit to 33 feet for each trailer, and forced all states to accept them.Companies such as FedEx and UPS have long sought to extend the length of trailers, because they often fill the 28-foot model with packages before hitting the 80,000-pound weight limit. Carrying more with each rig means greater efficiency, lower cost and more profit.But larger, heavier trucks also mean more wear and tear on highways and bridges that are already poorly maintained. Weigh stations and other facilities handling trucks would also need to be renovated and expanded, often at taxpayers' expense.Law enforcement and safety advocates also warn that double trailers are already more dangerous than regular semis, with an 11 percent higher crash fatality rate.“From a safety perspective, double 33-foot trailers are basically a disaster,"" said Robert Mills, a Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who spent 13 years as a roadside safety inspector and is a member of the Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee, which recommends rules to the federal government. Many truckers are not so pleased with the giant double trailers either, dubbing them ""wiggle wagons"" and ""widow makers."" Some haulers, including the smaller conglomerates Swift and Knight, joined with the Coalition Against Bigger Trucks to oppose their larger brethren's push to extend trailer lengths. Even crashes of doubles where there are no injuries in the initial impact leave dangerous scenes for other drivers when they're sprawled out across multiple lanes of traffic, said Balder, who is now working with the coalition.But CERT, the coalition of shippers, is determined to get approval for larger trucks, and was behind a push in 2012 requiring the Department of Transportation to study the impacts of size and weight increases. The industry coalition believed, or at least argued, that those impacts would be negligible; research proving that would help their case. But before that study was even completed, the coalition got its provision allowing longer trucks added to the House's version of the 2016 transportation spending bill. The DOT study, released in June 2015 two weeks after the House released the transportation bill, recommended against allowing larger trucks, saying the safety issues remained unresolved.There were several other industry requests in that funding bill for 2016, including a measure that aimed to extend the suspension of sleep rules that Collins had won just six months earlier. Her suspension lasted a year and required regulators to look into the effectiveness of requiring two nights of sleep and whether there was any case for the trucking industry's position. But rather than see that process through, the new provision changed the study mid-stream and called for gathering even more data — including the regulation's impact on the longevity of drivers. Studying workers' lifespans, of course, takes entire lifespans. That provision was signed into law with the 2016 spending bill that ultimately passed.“They just basically want to stall this forever,"" said Rep. David Price (N.C.), the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that deals with transportation.Another measure the industry pushed last year aimed to short-circuit federal regulators' efforts to evaluate raising insurance requirements for trucking companies. Currently, carriers have to maintain the same $750,000 policies they did in the '80s. The industry’s argument is that independent operators would not be able to afford higher premiums -- and indeed, DND's margins were so close it shut down when its insurance company raised rates after the Balder crash. The industry argues that 99 percent of truck accidents do not generate such high damages. But $750,000 doesn't begin to cover the costs a serious semi wreck incurs. For instance, a widower whose wife was killed and children severely injured by a dozing driver in 2010 won $41 million in damages. The family of James McNair, the comedian who died in the Tracy Morgan crash, settled for $10 million in March last year. A somewhat weakened version of the measure did pass, requiring regulators to evaluate a number of different factors before they adjust the insurance requirements.Another industry-backed provision aimed to hide the BASIC safety measurements for trucking companies from public view, and bar their use in lawsuits. The lawsuit provision was dropped from the spending bill during negotiations, but the BASIC scores were in fact hidden and removed from the agency's website. The industry used a Government Accountability Office study that found the safety system could do better in some respects to justify its position, but the two firms involved in the Velasquez crash had exactly the sort of poor safety scores that the BASIC system predicts make them more likely to be involved in accidents.Despite the fact that these provisions will likely have an impact on the safety of nearly 11 million large trucks registered in America, they were all buried in legislation that Congress had to pass to avoid a government shutdown, with little to no debate about whether they were a good idea.""The advocates of relaxing the rules or eliminating the rules, they see that and think this is their train to catch. ... Not just wait on the normal process, or count on something as pedestrian as actual hearings or discussion, but to make a summary judgement and latch it on to an appropriations bill,"" Price said.There's something else all the industry-backed measures have in common: They are deeply unpopular.The Huffington Post and YouGov surveyed Americans on four of the proposals the industry has been pursuing through the backdoor: teen drivers, longer trucks, heavier trucks, and the relaxed hours-of-service rules. In every case, respondents to the survey opposed the moves -- by large margins.Indeed, when proposals to weaken trucking safety do get a up-or-down vote on their own, they generally fail. When the Senate's version of the transportation funding bill came up for debate in November and October, an attempt to include the House's requirement for states to accept 33-foot trailers across the nation was voted down each time. Similarly, an attempt in the House last November to amend the highway construction bill to hike truck weight limits failed convincingly, 187 to 236.The trucking industry is certainly still trying, though. The backdoor approach is the easiest way for the industry to get around the safety restrictions that most Americans support. One initiative that it backed down on in 2015 was a bid to block states from enforcing regulations on rest and pay that are tougher than the federal government's. Large haulers got the preemption added to the House's highway construction bill, but couldn't get senators to consent.The trucking industry is back at it this year, adding a provision that would override state rest and overtime pay rules to a House bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration, which is currently operating on a stopgap measure that expires in mid-July. The Senate is working on a dramatically different version of that bill, which almost guarantees a situation where trucking lobbyists have thrived -- a rush to finish a must-pass bill behind closed doors with a looming deadline and little ability to alter deeply buried provisions.A Problem He Can't ForgetFor Douglas Balder, crashes are not just a byproduct of business and politics. His own near-fatal encounter is burned into his flesh and his memory.While he can't forget it, he also doesn't want to. He's read most of the 5,000-page NTSB investigation of his crash, and he still looks at the pictures of his destroyed squad car every couple of weeks. He said he doesn't know why he wants to keep replaying that night.
