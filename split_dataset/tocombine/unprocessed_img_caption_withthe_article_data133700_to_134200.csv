In a blog post on the website on Tuesday, the administration suggested additional flexibility, without specifying a new deadline.It was the administration's latest move of the goalposts as it tries to recover from technical failures and political missteps that dogged the enrollment drive for weeks after it opened on Oct. 1. Trying to make up for lost time, the administration has announced a series of last-minute changes and delays to get as many people as possible covered under the Affordable Care Act, Obama's major domestic policy initiative.Before Monday's rush, more than 1 million people had signed up for private coverage through HealthCare.gov - which serves 36 states - and 14 state-run marketplaces, according to state and federal estimates.The figure, though likely to climb by Christmas, is still short of previous estimates that 7 million people could enroll by the end of March, the last date to obtain health insurance coverage in 2014. About one-third or more will need to be young, healthy adults whose payments into the system would help offset the costs of covering older, sicker people.""Sometimes despite your best efforts, you might have run into delays caused by heavy traffic to HealthCare.gov, maintenance periods, or other issues with our systems that prevented you from finishing the process on time,"" Tuesday's blog post on HealthCare.gov said. ""If this happened to you, don't worry - we still may be able to help you get covered as soon as January 1."" MINIMIZING THE CONFUSIONThe problematic rollout of the health law known as Obamacare, which was passed in 2010 and survived legal challenges, helped send Obama's popularity ratings to record lows and stepped up Republican efforts to gut the law and use it against Democrats in 2014 congressional elections.The more recent changes, which the administration has said are intended to show flexibility, have introduced a new element of confusion for consumers as well as the health insurance companies who have been pressed by the government to allow new members to pay, and even sign up, past Jan. 1 for retroactive coverage. So far the industry has agreed to extend the first payment deadline to Jan. 10.""Health plans will continue to do everything they can to help consumers through the enrollment process and to mitigate potential confusion or disruption caused by all of these last minute changes to the rules and deadlines,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for American's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade and lobbying group.The Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in coverage by March 31 or face penalties that start at $95. This week's deadline, which had already been moved to Dec. 23 from Dec. 15, applied to coverage starting on Jan. 1.Last week, the administration said people whose plans were canceled because they did not meet new standards of coverage under the law would qualify for a ""hardship"" exemption that allows some people to avoid a penalty for not signing up for health insurance.Several state-run exchanges have also moved their enrollment deadlines. New York and California, two of the largest, added a one-day grace period similar to the federal insurance marketplace. Massachusetts said on Tuesday it would allow sign-ups until Dec. 31 given heavy volume and technical problems that have hampered its exchange. Rhode Island, Oregon and Maryland had already extended their deadlines beyond Christmas. (Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Grant McCool)"
1,BUSINESS,Target Hackers Stole PINs: Source,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/target-hack-pins_us_5bb3052ae4b0480ca661947f,"On Monday, Santander - a unit of Spain's Banco Santander - followed suit, lowering the daily limits on cash withdrawals and",2013-12-24,"A passer-by walks near an entrance to a Target retail store Thursday, Dec. 19, 2013 in Watertown, Mass. Target says that about 40 million credit and debit card accounts may have been affected by a data breach that occurred just as the holiday shopping season shifted into high gear. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3052a2000009900001944.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jim Finkle and David HenryBOSTON/NEW YORK, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The hackers who attacked Target Corp and compromised up to 40 million credit cards and debit cards also managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers (PINs), according to a senior payments executive familiar with the situation.One major U.S. bank fears that the thieves would be able to crack the encryption code and make fraudulent withdrawals from consumer bank accounts, said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data breach is still under investigation.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said ""no unencrypted PIN data was accessed"" and there was no evidence that PIN data has been ""compromised."" She confirmed that some ""encrypted data"" was stolen, but declined to say if that included encrypted PINs.""We continue to have no reason to believe that PIN data, whether encrypted or unencrypted, was compromised. And we have not been made aware of any such issue in communications with financial institutions to date,"" Snyder said by email. ""We are very early in an ongoing forensic and criminal investigation.""The No. 3 U.S. retailer said last week that hackers stole data from as many as 40 million cards used at Target stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season, making it the second-largest data breach in U.S. retail history.Target has not said how its systems were compromised, though it described the operation as ""sophisticated."" The U.S. Secret Service and the Justice Department are investigating. Officials with both agencies have declined comment on the investigations.The attack could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but it is unclear so far who will bear the expense.While bank customers are typically not liable for losses because of fraudulent activity on their credit and debit cards, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Santander Bank said they have lowered limits on how much cash customers can take out of teller machines and spend at stores.The unprecedented move has led to complaints from consumer advocates about the inconvenience it caused from the late November Thanksgiving holiday into the run-up to Christmas. But sorting out account activity after a fraudulent withdrawal could take a lot more time and be worse for customers.JPMorgan has said it was able to reduce inconvenience by giving customers new debit cards printed quickly at many of its branches, and by keeping branches open for extended hours. A Santander spokeswoman was not available for comment on Tuesday.Security experts said it is highly unusual for banks to reduce caps on withdrawals, and the move likely reflects worries that PINs have fallen into criminal hands, even if they are encrypted.""That's a really extreme measure to take,"" said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in cyber security and fraud detection. ""They definitely found something in the data that showed there was something happening with cash withdrawals."" BREAKING THE CODEWhile the use of encryption codes may prevent amateur hackers from obtaining the digital keys to customer bank deposits, the concern is the coding cannot stop the kind of sophisticated cyber criminal who was able to infiltrate Target for three weeks.Daniel Clemens, CEO of Packet Ninjas, a cyber security consulting firm, said banks were prudent to lower debit card limits because they will not know for sure if Target's PIN encryption was infallible until the investigation is completed.As an example of potential vulnerabilities in PIN encryption, Clemens said he once worked for a retailer who hired his firm to hack into its network to find security vulnerabilities. He was able to access the closely guarded digital ""key"" used to unscramble encrypted PINs, which he said surprised his client, who thought the data was secure.In other cases, hackers can get PINs by using a tool known as a ""RAM scraper,"" which captures the PINs while they are temporarily stored in memory, Clemens said.The attack on Target began on Nov. 27, the day before the Thanksgiving holiday and continued until Dec. 15. Banks that issue debit and credit cards learned about the breach on Dec. 18, and Target publicly disclosed the loss of personal account data on Dec. 19.On Dec. 21, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, alerted 2 million of its debit cardholders that it was lowering the daily limits on ATM withdrawals to $100 and capping store purchases with their cards at $500.On Monday, the bank partly eased the limits it had imposed on Saturday, setting them at $250 a day for ATM withdrawals and $1,000 a day for purchases. (The usual debit card daily limits are $200 to $500 for cash withdrawals and $500 for purchases, a bank spokeswoman said last week.)On Monday, Santander - a unit of Spain's Banco Santander - followed suit, lowering the daily limits on cash withdrawals and purchases on Santander and Sovereign branded debit and credit cards of customers who used them at Target when the breach occurred. Santander did not disclose the new limits, but said it was monitoring the accounts and issuing new cards to customers who were affected.The largest breach against a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months.

It is much easier with friends than it is with my kids. I'm attached to the outcome with them, as I try to teach and guide on a daily basis. I don't share all the shenanigans that go on in my home because I like to respect their privacy. They are normal kids, which means they are not polite little robots, but rather unique expressions of life. They are their own people and not something I form out of clay. My children continually challenge my own capacity for growth. Like most moms, it is the most important job to me, and the one I feel I can screw up the most at. There is no manual for every child or every situation. Getting mad when one kid hurts another is normal for me. I'm not all ""let's all love one another"" when things get intense. I have unrealistic expectations of how they should treat each other and me at times. We are not on a sitcom of Nickelodeon. Real love is messy. People annoy each other. They fight. Kids may be angels at school and save the crazy for you. You will not understand your kids and they will not understand you. Kids lie and it stabs you in the heart, but that isn't their intention. They are just protecting themselves in their own way. We can read this in theory but in the real deal, day to day, it can be overwhelming. You may feel spent on discipline and effort. The relationship between a parent and a child is the weirdest relationship you will ever have. It is close and intimate. It is cold and distant, with hearts raw and broken. And this could vary not by the year or the day, but by the moment. There will never be a relationship that changes as much in a lifetime as this one. Even with different children, one may challenge you to the core of your love, patience, and sanity recesses.Sometimes the only I answer I know has no words. It is beyond saying sorry. It may be when you don't get a sorry, but you forgive anyway. It is letting go. It is love. It is starting over. It is as a parent, taking your feelings once expressed, and rising above the right and the wrongness. The truth is your child may hurt your feelings worse than anyone in your life ever could and you will still keep your heart open. It is a kind of amnesia that is planted in your heart. No matter what, you would die for your child, even if they hate you. You may say you are done, you are not giving anymore of yourself, and you set boundaries. But a parents' boundaries are never solid, they melt away at the thought of any pain your child could experience. The love is the truest thing. The mistakes are human. No matter how old your child is, it is never too late to start again. Put the pride aside and throw the score card away. Let love help you forget. At the end of your life, you will know that love is never wasted. You will know that letting go, forgetting, releasing the drama is a kind of amnesia for the soul's own good. I call this my Momnesia."
