For fans of the coast, though, the end of summer doesn't necessarily mean the end of beach trips. The world is still full of spectacular coastlines to explore, many of which are more famous for their breathtaking views, cultural heritage, and unique geography than for their hazy beach-bum appeal.To learn more about these incredible stretches of coast, we've gone to the community of thousands of travelers and locals at minube to find the most awe-inspiring coastlines the world has to offer. From the magical bays of Southeast Asia to the rugged, red coasts of North Africa, here are the world's 10 most dramatic coastlines.The Twelve Apostles, Australia - Really, the entirety of Australia's Great Ocean Road is spectacular enough for its own article. For now, though, we'll leave you with the most stunning and popular stop: The Twelve Apostles, located along Shipwreck Coast in Victoria's Port Campbell National Park. Make sure to visit this awe-inspiring stretch of coast while you can; the relentless and unforgiving action of the wind and waves have toppled two of the massive limestone stacks in the past decade.

Despite it's unique beauty, the area of Legzira is still not on the typical tourist radar and offers a chance for travelers to really get away from it all.

The stretch of coast is most famous for being the home to the world's only colony of endangered monk seals, but is also known for its imposing cliffs and surreal red sands. (Photo by Miguel A. Fernandez)Click here to see more photos of Mauritania Los Gigantes, Spain - Only a few hundred miles from Cap Blanc, the sleepy resort town of Los Gigantes (""The Giants"") in Spain's Canary Islands offers a wealth to explore for view-junkies and ocean fanatics. Aside from the aptly-named cliffs which tower an astonishing quarter-mile above the area's notoriously rough seas, the hidden black-sand beaches and bright turquoise waters also add to Los Gigantes' stunning visual splendor. (Photo by Zu Sanchez)Click here to see more photos of the Canary IslandsCliffs of Moher, Ireland - While not the largest seaside cliffs on this list (they're only 390ft.), Ireland's Cliffs of Moher are certainly among the most famous, and with good reason. Home to countless species of birds, underwater caves, and simply grandiose natural formations, the Cliffs of Moher is a favorite among both locals and travelers, and visitors can explore the length of the coast via a cliff-top trail or catch one of the local ferries to take in the cliffs' craggy beauty from sea-level.

Payá) Click here for more photos of the Cliffs of MoherCape Town, South Africa - Cape Town's unique location at the intersection of mountains, valleys, and ocean gives it one of the world's most unforgettable coastlines. While the metropolitan area is home to over 70 peaks, the best views can be had from the iconic Table Mountain or Lion's Head, an ocean side peak which lets travelers soak in the emerald South Atlantic waters, the city, and area's endless rocky outcroppings all in one glimpse.

Aside from sheer visual splendor, Ha Long Bay is also home to countless caves, many offering privileged views of the surrounding islands, and a wide variety of endemic wildlife. Your best bet to thoroughly explore the nooks and crannies of this magical coast is to buy a bunk on one of the local boats, which regularly take excursions to key points in the bay. (Photo by Leo Cediel)Click here to see more photos of Ha Long BayLofoten Islands, Norway - All travelers who've ventured within the Arctic Circle to the Norweigan archipelago of Lofoten agree -- the coastline will leave you speechless. The area is covered with epic peaks, secluded bays and rocky islands, dotted by the festive red homes of the tiny fishing villages which line the shores. To get a unique perspective of Lofoten's dramatic coast, head there during early June when the Artice Circle's famous ""midnight sun"" keeps the area illuminated 24-hours a day. (Photo by Cochise)Click here to see more photos of LofotenKrabi, Thailand - Thailand's Krabi area is a premiere destination among backpackers and sun-seekers the world over, no doubt drawn by the paradisical beaches and otherworldy limestone karsts. While some travelers might be turned off by the mass-tourism in the area's main resort towns, there are dozens of lesser-known islands like Ko Lanta or Koh Yao Noi which still offer peaceful, quiet beaches and undisturbed views of this truly unique coastline.

Constructive daydreams are the instrument by which you create your world.Go ahead: Gaze out the window, daydream about the future. Successful achievements begin with inner visions that you create while in the shower or stuck in traffic. However, you can’t stop there! You must repeat those visions over time until they are very clear in your mind. The clearer the picture, the more real it feels.Felt visions become the initial substance that causes changes in your life -- not figuratively, but actually. A daydream that you can feel, although it starts out as fantasy, will harden into fact. But, when there’s doubt, you live without, because the vision is fuzzy and your feelings are nebulous.Below, find a recipe for turning daydreams into future facts.Visit RobWhiteMedia.com and download the free Daily WOW!

We all love it, we all eat it, but it's a condiment -- something meant to enhance other delicious things, never really the star of the show. Some of us have a favorite ketchup, but no one ever says, ""Hey, have a great ketchup recipe?"" Ketchup is one of America's top three best-selling condiments, and we usually associate the flavor with burgers, hot dogs (okay, not you Chicago) and the ubiquitous meatloaf glaze. Ketchup is great at all of those things, but it also shows up time and time again in recipes you might not expect. Ketchup is also a key ingredient in sticky, sweet barbecue sauces, smoky baked beans and even Thai noodle dishes. As we slowly transition from grilling burgers out back to braising briskets in the kitchen, we're going to try to keep track of all the supporting roles ketchup plays in our recipes.

6,FOOD & DRINK,The Best Colleges for Food in America for 2013,"The Daily Meal, Contributor
All things food and drink",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-best-colleges-for-foo_us_5b9d8ae6e4b03a1dcc895075,"If food is your priority, make sure you keep those transfer forms handy after reading these picks for most outstanding campus dining.",2013-09-24,2013-09-24-colleges-colleges2013promocarletoncollege1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-24-colleges-colleges2013promocarletoncollege1.jpg,"Another school year is finally upon us, and with it comes the reality that for many, many schools across America, the dining options are nothing short of grim at best. For many students who are reliant on a meal plan, the less said about the meals eaten in campus dining halls the better. But some colleges and universities go above and beyond in their efforts to serve fresh, wholesome meals to the students who are living and studying there. From a college in Vermont that only sources its food from local vendors to one in Massachusetts that hosts a farmers' market that's entirely student-run, we tracked down the best colleges for food in America. (Image Credit: Carleton College)Click Here to see the 60 Best Colleges for Food in AmericaLast summer, The Daily Meal conducted an eye-opening study, building on our previous ranking, that examined the most outstanding campus dining at nearly all of the approximately 2,000 four-year colleges across America. We discovered some schools that gave their students top-notch dining experiences, while others failed to pass even the most simple health inspections. However, in the end we found 52 clear winners that refused to accept the stigma that comes with collegiate dining, taking the ordinary campus meal and turning it into an extraordinary dining experience. For this year's second annual study, we had a few goals in mind when revamping the list: to see if the schools that wowed us last year were still maintaining culinary perfection; to see the improvements some of the average dining programs have made to possibly rise in the ranks; and to see if any colleges that didn't make the cut last year have begun to see the importance their dining services have to students. We connected with passionate and candid dining services directors, managers, and chefs, and learned that more than ever, students on the whole are already passionate and knowledgeable about food when they arrive at campus, and are interested in trying new foods and want to know where it's coming from. Click Here to see the 25 Best College Bars in AmericaHere's the methodology we used to come up with the Best Colleges for Food in America for 2013:• Healthy Food/Local and Sustainable: The meals are made in-house from scratch as well as cooked in small batches, and the school is committed to teaching their students the benefits of buying locally and maintaining healthy lifestyles.• Accessibility and Service: The number of eateries on campus along with the daily hours, and how well these locations are taken care of.• Events/Nutritional Education: Events are centered on food, and the dining halls help bring students together in an engaging way. Additionally, if they educated their students about nutrition through these events or on their website, it was a bonus.• The 'X Factor': Something unique and creative that differentiated the school's dining services from the rest of the pack.• Student Feedback/ Social Media: While we still valued many of the things we noted from last year -- for example, whether students are interested in trying new cuisines and spices as well as very invested in sustainable and local dining -- there are still many schools that seemed to fall short when we evaluated their dining performances. Therefore, we made student feedback and social media outlets the last category in our assessment this year. It seemed appropriate this time around to incorporate how well-received student requests or complaints are by the dining services, as well as the frequency that these pages are updated to inform their students about new additions or changes.While we did evaluate the schools for how great the actual food is, the most important aspect to us was the overall dining experience, everything from restaurant-quality food to ""going green."" As a result, several of the schools that were seen as the leaders on last year's list have been joined by institutions have improved their dining services. While the hierarchy might be changed, all the schools on our list still go above and beyond the call of duty. And while there is a clear hierarchy, we'd be happy to eat at any of the colleges on this list. The truth is that life can be pretty delicious if you're an undergrad.For example, Occidental College engages their students in yearly events like ""Oxy Iron Chef"" and holiday theme nights; Bowdoin's dining hall blog and their dining hall food magazine, The Bowdoin Gourmet, are designed to constantly keep students in the loop. Emory University offers their students cooking classes on topics like the best wine and meal pairings and mixology 101, while Kennesaw State harvests their own honey, mushrooms, and herbs from campus gardens. Washington University in St. Louis allows students to customize and order campus food online, and Cornell has had guests like The New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman come to campus and speak about conscious eating.It seems somewhat difficult to grasp how truly amazing some dining programs are, but with this list, we've tried to highlight how impressive and tasty life can be at one of these schools. If food is your priority, make sure you keep those transfer forms handy after reading our picks for the Best Colleges for Food in America.-Dana Kaufman, The Daily MealMore Content from The Daily Meal: 10 International Burger Chains 15 Hot Dogs from Around the World 101 Best Food Trucks in America"

Pinsky, who is now 55, initially went to the doctor for a check-up in 2011. There, he took a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, a common screening test for prostate cancer. Pinsky's doctor found that his PSA level was a ""4,"" up from a ""1"" -- which for some men could mean something, while for others, it could mean nothing -- and he also had an enlarged central prostate lobe. He was diagnosed with inflammation of the prostate, but because of the slightly elevated PSA score, Pinsky's doctor opted to also conduct a biopsy -- which revealed that he had a low-grade tumor.Active surveillance was the approach Pinsky and his doctor decided together to take until, two biopsies later, it became clear that the tumor was spreading. Pinsky opted to have a radical robotic prostatectomy in July 2013 -- essentially, a surgical procedure where the prostate gland is completely removed from the body. And good thing he opted to have the procedure; he wrote that ""the tumor had a 'finger' on it that was millimeters from being contained. It was ready to spread, and would have, had it not been removed."" So why didn't Pinsky elect to have the prostatectomy earlier, when it first became clear that he had prostate cancer? He wrote: My years of training and experience had taught me not to panic about prostate issues. Research shows 30 percent of low-grade prostate tumors get worse during a 10-year span. Thirty percent get better. Thirty percent stay the same.Indeed, not all prostate cancer tumors are the same. Some tumors grow so slowly that, if it's discovered in a man who is of an older age who has a limited life expectancy, it may not grow rapidly enough to pose a health risk. It's also a good option for men whose tumors aren't causing any symptoms, or if it seems to be confined to just one part of the prostate, the Mayo Clinic noted.During active surveillance, a doctor will continuously monitor the growth, if any, of a prostate cancer tumor. What active surveillance does not entail, is drugs, surgery or radiation. The tumor is monitored with ultrasounds, PSA tests, digital rectal exams and biopsies (to determine aggressiveness), according to the American Cancer Society. That's not to say that every man with a low-risk prostate cancer tumor will opt for active surveillance. The University of California, San Francisco, points out that the idea of having cancer -- even if it's not yet harmful -- can make some men uncomfortable, while other men may not want to do regular checkups with their doctor. However, active surveillance is an option for men who don't want to experience negative side effects from cancer treatment, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Indeed, Pinsky pointed out in his blog post that fears about cancer treatment side effects often keep men from getting screened for prostate cancer in the first place. He wrote:What concerns many males faced with prostate cancer is not the cancer itself, but possible incontinence, and sex. Nerves at the base of the penis, necessary for an erection, can be irreparably damaged by surgery and radiation. Research shows that many men do not get tested for prostate cancer because they fear the effects of surgery they may not even need!"

We'd never actually heard the model sing before -- would this be a pleasant surprise à la Karen Elson and Cara Delevingne, or would it be like that time Heidi Klum recorded her own Christmas single?Neither. Turns out ""Day And All Night"" doesn't require Kate to sing at all. Instead, the track takes clips of Kate talking about her Stuart Weitzman Fall 2014 campaign from an interview and loops them up, giving us lyrics like ""I think thigh-high boots are especially sexy and glamorous"" and, um, ""Stuart Weitzman."" Kudos to Moss for figuring out a way to launch a music career without actually singing (take that, Jamie Hince). And despite the less-than-riveting lyrics, the catchy beat and saxophone solo (!) of this track, created by DJ/producer Brendan Fallis and Andrew Watt, are actually sort of mesmerizing. Is it weird that we're listening to this on repeat... and enjoying it? LISTEN:The next best thing to being a singer? Dating one:Want more?
