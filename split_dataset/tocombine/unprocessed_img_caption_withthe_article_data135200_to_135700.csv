0,QUEER VOICES,Nelson Mandela's Impact On Gay Rights Discussed By South African Journalist Mark Gevisser,"Michelangelo Signorile, Columnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nelson-mandela-gay-rights_us_5bafbeffe4b0ad7692614299,"Gevisser noted, too, that Mandela spent over two decades in prison, where there were strong taboos on homosexuality, which",2013-12-08,"In this undated image released Monday Oct. 11, 2010, by the Nelson Mandela Foundation, showing elder statesman Nelson Mandela holding an advance copy of his book entitled "" Conversations with Myself "" which is released Monday Oct. 11, 2010. The book is compiled from decades of notes, letters, recorded conversations and other personal material which chronicles his journey from prisoner on Robben Island to his role as political front man for the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and worldwide statesman, and with a foreword by U.S. President Barack Obama. (AP Photo/Debbie Yazbek, Nelson Mandela Foundation)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbeff2100000001c703c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LGBT leaders and gay pundits in the U.S.  have praised Nelson Mandela in recent days as a champion who, as the first democratically-elected president in South Africa, led the nation to pave the way globally on LGBT rights. But prominent South African author and journalist Mark Gevisser, who wrote a prize-winning biography of his country's second democratically-elected president, Thabo Mbeki, and who co-edited a critically-acclaimed collection of essays on gay and lesbian life in South Africa, said Mandela’s history on LGBT rights was more complicated.“I would temper that analysis a bit,” Gevisser said in interview with me on SiriusXM Progress, speaking from Cape Town. “It was not Mandela who brought the notion of LGBT rights into the ANC [African National Congress, the governing party].” Gevisser, who lived and worked in New York writing for the Village Voice and The Nation in the 1980s, returned to South Africa in 1990, covering the tumultuous transformation of the country for the Mail & Guardian and other publications. He said there’s no question that South Africa is a global leader on LGBT rights. It formed a constitution in 1996 which outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. That became the basis for judicial action which ultimately led to Parliament legislating in favor of same-sex marriage in 2006. ""A lot of that happened on Nelson Mandela’s watch,” Gevisser said. “But it wasn’t something Mandela was always comfortable with. Mandela was a man of his generation. He went to a conservative mission school.”Gevisser noted, too, that Mandela spent over two decades in prison, where there were strong taboos on homosexuality, which was “used as a form of abuse and control.”“So it would be wrong to say he was always comfortable with LGBT rights,” Gevisser continued. “I think what is extraordinary about him and his generation…is that when it was sort of explained to them by younger comrades [who’d spent time in the West in exile]…when it was explained to these old men that human rights are indivisible, and that, just as you can’t discriminate against someone because of the color of her skin, you can’t discriminate against someone because of her sexual orientation, they got it. And they got it very quickly. They didn’t stand in the way of this extraordinary legal process that happened in South Africa.”On AIDS, Gevisser agrees with those who've noted that Mandela came late to the battle. It was only after he left office that he became a passionate AIDS activist, Gevisser said, as Mandela realized that his response as president had been inadequate and began tirelessly working to stem the epidemic. Gevisser also described what he said was one of the most moving moments he experienced in his work as a journalist covering the dramatic changes in South Africa, a story that underscores the impact Mandela has had on changing attitudes in South Africa about equality for LGBT people.“I was writing about a young lesbian couple, in about 1996 or ’97, when Mandela was still president,” he said. “A black couple who had been married in an amazing black gay and lesbian church — I mean, they weren’t married legally; the church married them. And there was a big problem among their families when they got married. The family of one woman went and beat up the other family for having taken their daughter away. The whole thing ended up in a police station in Soweto.” Gevisser said the the station commander, who was a young black woman who had been appointed to the job as part of the first generation of new democratic leaders, pointed to a poster of Nelson Mandela on the wall. “She said to these two families, ‘Listen, that man, your father, the father of our freedom, says it’s okay for these women to be together. And if he says that, who are you to argue?’ And it sorted things out,” Gevisser said. “It’s not that Mandela ever took the mic and said, ‘I love gay people,' or, ‘Gay people have rights.’ He never did. He studiously never did. But he accepted it. He was the leader of the party that brought about this reform, so that that station commander could point to him and say, 'He says it’s okay.’”Listen to the full clip of Gevisser speaking about Nelson Mandela on LGBT rights."

Photographer: Brett Gundlock/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14c792200005700db4365.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Patrick Rucker and Nia WilliamsWASHINGTON/CALGARY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Canada is running out of time to offer U.S. President Barack Obama a climate change concession that might clinch the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, as the country's energy industry continues to resist costly curbs on greenhouse gas emissions.Two years of negotiations between the Canadian government and the energy sector to curtail carbon pollution have not produced an agreement. Oil producers have balked at anything more than the 10-cents-a-barrel carbon tax imposed by the province of Alberta.Late last month, Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq pointed to ""good progress"" in the talks but was unable to say when a resolution might come.Concessions from Canada would make the pipeline more palatable in Washington, experts say, since Obama has made fighting climate change a second-term priority and has said that Canada could do more to reduce carbon emissions.By linking Alberta's fields to refiners in the Gulf Coast, the 1,200-mile (1,900-kilometer) Keystone XL pipeline would be a boon to an energy patch where oil sands are abundant but lead to more carbon pollution than many other forms of crude.Keystone's foes say that burning fossil fuels to wrench oil sands crude from the ground will worsen climate change, and that the $5.4 billion pipeline, which could carry up to 830,000 barrels a day, would only spur more production.Increasing oil sands production will put Canada on track to miss its target of curbing greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, according to a government report (full report:).Keystone supporters say that is why Canada would be wise to offer a carbon-trimming plan before the White House decides the pipeline's fate.""If Canada were to volunteer new greenhouse gas restrictions, that would certainly help,"" David Goldwyn, a former State Department official and energy consultant, told an industry conference in late October.But the clock is running out. The U.S. State Department is finishing work on a report that will weigh the climate impacts of the pipeline in what could be one of last words before a decision. The White House is expected to rule on Keystone by next spring. NEW LIMITSCanada and the United States have often moved together on climate policy, developing similar rules on auto and power-plant emissions while turning their backs on the Kyoto Protocol to limit climate change.Regulating the oil and gas sector has been thornier, though, with oil sands producers particularly concerned that higher costs will erode their already narrow margins.""Anything more stringent than today's system will increase costs, possibly lowering investments and reducing production,"" the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers wrote in a memo to regulators in March that was made public under a freedom of information request.Canada's fast-growing oil sands sector will soon exceed the capacity of existing pipelines, and analysts say producers will be forced to rely on trains, barges and other transportation alternatives if Keystone XL and related projects are rejected. Those options are generally costlier and less certain than pipelines.Nevertheless, industry executives say they doubt yielding on tougher pollution regulations will help secure Keystone.""I don't know any policies in Canada with respect to (greenhouse gas) emissions that would have any sort of material impact on the approval process,"" Russ Girling, president of TransCanada, the pipeline operator, said last month.Even if Prime Minister Stephen Harper were to offer new greenhouse gas limits this year, the vagaries of the regulatory process virtually guarantee those plans will not be in place until after a Keystone decision.Canada needed 12 months to finalize regulations curbing emissions from coal-fired power plants that were ratified last year, and the rules were significantly weaker in the end than originally proposed.""Judging by what we saw with coal-fired power plants, there is a real risk that a proposal to limit oil and gas emissions could be watered down before it's final,"" said P.J. Partington of the Pembina Institute, a think tank that has opposed oil sands development, which reviewed the industry memos disclosed under the freedom of information request."

As Greenlanders adapt to the changing climate and go on with their lives, researchers from the National Science Foundation and other organizations are studying the phenomena of the melting glaciers and its long-term ramifications for the rest of the world. In recent years, sea level rise in places such as Miami Beach has led to increased street flooding and prompted leaders such as New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to propose a $19.5 billion plan to boost the citys capacity to withstand future extreme weather events by, among other things, devising mechanisms to withstand flooding. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14c792500003200381ba7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Environment Correspondent Alister DoyleOSLO, Dec 8 (Reuters) - A thaw of Arctic ice and snow is linked to worsening summer heatwaves and downpours thousands of miles south in Europe, the United States and other areas, underlying the scale of the threat posed by global warming, scientists said on Sunday.Their report, which was dismissed as inconclusive by some other experts, warned of increasingly extreme weather across ""much of North America and Eurasia where billions of people will be affected"".The study is part of a drive to work out how climate change affects the frequency of extreme weather, from droughts to floods. Governments want to know the trends to plan everything from water supplies to what crops to plant.But the science of a warming Arctic is far from settled.Writing in the journal Nature Climate Change, experts in China and the United States said they could not conclusively say the Arctic thaw caused more extreme weather, or vice versa.But they said they had found evidence of a relationship between the two. Rising temperatures over thawing snow on land and sea ice in the Arctic were changing atmospheric pressure and winds, the report said.The changes slowed the eastward movement of vast meandering weather systems and meant more time for extreme weather to develop - such as a heatwave in Russia in 2010, droughts in the United States and China in 2011 and 2012, or heavy summer rains that caused floods in Britain in 2012, the paper added.""The study contributes to a growing body of evidence that ... the melting Arctic has wide-ranging implications for people living in the middle latitudes,"" lead author Qiuhong Tang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Reuters. VANISHING ICESea ice in the Arctic shrank to a record low in 2012 and the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists says it could almost vanish in summers by 2050 with rising greenhouse gas emissions.But some scientists said other factors, including the usual vagaries of weather or changing sea temperatures, may explain some recent extremes rather than changes in the Arctic.""The jury is still very much out,"" James Screen, an expert at Exeter University in England, said of efforts to see if there is a link between a melting Arctic and extremes further south in the northern hemisphere.Some evidence in Sunday's study was ""plausible ... but far from conclusive,"" he said, adding that some of the data were not statistically significant and might be random variations.""For people on the streets, what really matters is whether the extremes are changing or not. But from the scientific perspective we want to understand why,"" he said. Better understanding is vital to make reliable predictions.In September, the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists raised the probability that most global warming since 1950 has a human cause - mostly gases released by burning fossil fuels - to 95 percent from 90 in a previous assessment in 2007.James Overland, of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said many extremes studied were in the past decade, too short to know for sure if they were enhanced by Arctic ice and snow melt or not.""Sceptics remain unconvinced that Arctic/mid-latitude linkages are proven, and this work will do little to change their viewpoint,"" he wrote in a comment in Nature Climate Change.Still, he said there was a high potential for an Arctic influence, given the outlook for a further thaw.

We look forward to encouraging others to take stock of their lives and pursue their own travel dreams.In 2011, we quit our jobs, sold our house and gave away most of our possessions. Our initial goal was to travel around the world for a year. On the surface what we did seems a bit crazy, particularly for two people who had just turned 50. Weren't we supposed to be settling comfortably into middle-age and looking forward to retirement? But life hadn't worked out like we had hoped.Our relationship with our adult daughter, whom we had adopted from Russia when she was nine, was shattered, turning us into reluctant empty-nesters. Suddenly our jobs and home no longer seemed relevant to us. One day we looked at each other and said, ""Is this all life has to offer?"" Deciding a major shake-up of our lives was necessary to heal from the breakdown of our family, we turned to our longstanding passion for travel. So we chucked it all to travel around the world for a year. What would we do when we returned? We had no idea. We started out on a one-way plane ticket to China with only a rough notion of where we'd end up exploring. Oh, and since we're from Philadelphia we brought along a statue of movie icon Rocky Balboa to encourage us to ""go the distance."" More on that in future stories.Over two years later we're still on the road. Along the way we've discovered that instead of acquiring ""things,"" we'd rather collect a wealth of experiences. By living more simply, we can travel longer and farther than we ever dreamed possible. So far we've been to six continents, traveling slowly so we can absorb the unique culture of a place and its people. With no permanent address, we now consider the world our home.Somewhere along the way to transforming our lives we found new careers; we're now full-time travel writers. The title of the blog we started to chronicle our journey, Changes in Longitude, has become symbolic, highlighting the changes we've experienced as we've circled the globe. We were somewhat shocked (and delighted) when it won the 2013 Lowell Thomas Travel Journalism Silver Award for Best Travel Blog as selected by the Society of American Travel Writers Foundation. On the Huffington Post we'll share more about our global journey: from far-flung locations like North Korea and Qatar, to little-known spots in Australia, France, the Americas and beyond. We'll touch down in hidden neighborhoods, and provide tips on living like a local to go beyond the typical tourist experiences. If you've ever dreamed of chucking it all to reinvent yourself--or you just love to travel--come along for the ride!"
