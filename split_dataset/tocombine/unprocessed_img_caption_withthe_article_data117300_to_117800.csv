Cristiano Ronaldo became an unlikely hero to many U.S. Soccer fans just days after he broke so many of their hearts. With the U.S. trailing Germany deep into their match on the final day of play in the Group of Death, American fans were nervously eying the deadlocked clash between Portugal and Ghana being played simultaneously. For 23 tense minutes, Ghana pressured the Portugal defense, looking for a goal that could have potentially eliminated the U.S. team. Then Ronaldo stepped up for Portugal -- and the United States. The Portugal star scored against Ghana in the 80th minute, putting his team on top in Brasilia and giving the U.S. some breathing room in Recife. His goal would be the last in Group G as Portugal held on for a 2-1 win over Ghana. That result helped the U.S. advance out of the ""Group of Death"" despite losing 1-0 to Germany. (GIF via @FlyByKnite)The left-footed blast seemed to make amends for the late equalizer Ronaldo set up to rescue a 2-2 draw for Portugal against the U.S. in their group-stage confrontation. Once it was buried in the back of the Ghana net, U.S. fans on Twitter got busy offering thanks and paying tribute. "

For international organizations to be successful and create lasting change, they need to take a holistic view to assess the issues at hand, and then build out programs locally that will have the capacity, structure, and support to make a difference. Once enough local programs are in place, the hope is to reach a tipping point where the effects are felt around the world.In no other sector is this more evident than in what we call Sport for Good. The idea of Sport for Good focuses on using the power of sports to tackle some of society's most pressing issues. This means much more than providing recreational sports or just building a soccer field so kids have a place to play. Instead the focus is on using sports as the platform to provide the structure, mentorship, and guidance necessary for underserved children to gain an education, learn how to lead healthy lives, and put them on a path for success in life beyond the playing field.As the sector continues to grow, we collectively owe a huge debt of gratitude to the late Nelson Mandela. Mandela was a major advocate for using sports to promote change, and many people credit him with being the ""father"" of Sport for Good. In fact, he was the first Patron of Laureus back in 1999 and truly helped set the vision for what Sport for Good could be. As the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation approaches its 15th birthday this month, his guidance and leadership are still found throughout our programs, as well as with other leading organizations that share our mission.He was instrumental in recognizing the impact sports can have on a community, establishing the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund that provided programs throughout South Africa. He encouraged youth to participate because he understood the lasting positive effects it would have on his people. He had innate understanding of the need for community involvement to truly make a difference on a larger scale. This inspired thousands of sport for development non-profit organizations to grow from the grassroots level over the years, all of which help to fulfill his legacy and mission he set forth for us.In order for the ultimate power of sport to be realized, Mandela created an overall global vision that would be supported by customized, youth-oriented programs implemented on a local level. To make this happen, a strong network of organizations working together needed to be established along with a solid pipeline of funding support from outside sources, which Mandela helped mobilize first in South Africa, and then around the globe.Sport for Good is still young, particularly in the U.S., but a number of local organizations have emerged, working hand-in-hand with international nonprofits and backers to bring the global vision to life. For example Up2Us, a nonprofit based in New York City, has established the Coach Across America program that provides training to coaches in 33 states to ensure kids have effective mentors and guidance. Playworks is another organization providing structured in-school recess activities to kids in 23 states, where they also help train coaches and mentors in under resourced communities. These are just a couple organizations, along with the likes of the Aspen Institute's Project Play and countless others that share common goals in the effort to push Mandela's legacy forward and bring his vision to life around the world. Additionally, a number of corporations such as Mercedes-Benz USA and IWC Schaffhausen have provided outstanding support and grants, making most of this great work possible. Without the support of corporate backers, a strong network of individual donors, and foundations, none of Mandela's vision or these local programs would be able to survive.At the first ever Laureus Sports Awards in 2000 in Monaco Mandela said, ""Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope, where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers. It laughs in face of all types of discrimination.""Those words are what Sport for Good is founded on, and what the organizations I mentioned strongly believe can lead to global change. Mandela provided us with the global vision; it's on us to make it happen in schools and communities around the globe. As the Sport for Good sector matures and these networks and programs evolve and become more sophisticated, the power of sport that Mandela spoke of will become much more evident in people's everyday lives. Whether it's making communities safer, improving health and reducing obesity, or educating and mentoring, sports truly do have the power to change the world. "

(Photo by Eric Gay-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d2e49e280000052d6fd710.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The moral panic regarding the children in detention along the border is not helping, its hurting. Over the past two weeks, media attention on the unaccompanied minors has swelled, with particular attention paid to the conditions of Border Patrol detention facilities where the children are being held. Photos have circulated of children in cramped quarters, sleeping on the floor under heat-reflective blankets. While there is no doubt that seeing children in such conditions is distressing, the public concern for the children's well-being is revealing itself to be deeply mixed with anxiety regarding the presence of Latino immigrants in the US. The language is frightening: dramatic narratives of a ""surge"" or ""flood"" or ""wave"" of impoverished, sick, smelly and morally questionable youngsters and their families rushing across the border because they heard the US might be offering amnesty. For decades, dangerous water metaphors have been used to describe immigrants. Such language is powerful. It operates culturally to distance those being discussed, remove them from the sphere of the ""human,"" and promote fear and anxiety in the mind of the reader. But while it is easy to cherry pick news articles and quotes from elected officials using racialized metaphors, there is a more subtle yet related trend in the way the unaccompanied minors are being discussed in the mainstream media that is equally concerning. Even well-intended articles can be destructive when they lead to short-sighted reactions. Too often, the way the crisis has been communicated in the media dwells on visually appreciable symptoms of suffering without questioning the underlying systems that expose some to suffering by design. Such a discourse invites short term and superficial ""feel-good-about-ourselves"" solutions that do nothing to address the underlying root causes that compel people to leave their homes and families and risk their lives migrating in the first place.Root CausesAs was stated recently in the National Journal, ""this is not a migration story"" but rather a foreign policy failure. The children in detention in Arizona and Texas are primarily from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, countries that suffer from political instability, violence and poverty. Although the reasons for these conditions are complex, the role of the US cannot be overlooked. US foreign policy in Central America over the past 50-60 years has often eroded democracy, weakened civil society and increased criminal impunity. As historian Greg Grandin described it, the US ""turned Central America into one of the last killing fields of the Cold War."" From supporting the United Fruit Company to ousting democratically-elected leaders to promoting CAFTA, the United States has secured its economic interests in the region through violence and imperialism. Not only has US foreign policy proved detrimental, but recent domestic policies have exacerbated problems. In 1996, the passage of the Illegal Immigrant Reform & Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) prompted an accelerated deportation process, which led to many returning to their home countries with criminal connections that were developed through incarceration in the US. Gang violence flourished, and Honduras now has the highest murder rate in the world. Furthermore, law enforcement and governmental agencies, partially funded by the US through programs like the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), have high levels of corruption and inefficiency. It should come as no surprise then that thousands are fleeing Central American countries. In fact, the United Nations refugee agency initiated an empirical study of the unaccompanied minors which found that more than half of the children were forcibly displaced, ""meaning that if the U.S. refused these children, it could be in breach of U.N. conventions."" In other words, these unaccompanied child migrants should be considered refugees rather than immigrants. But so should their parents, who have been risking their lives crossing the border for the past decade. The humanitarian crisis is not new -- mothers have been searching for missing sons, wives for lost husbands, daughters for disappeared dads. People have been and will continue to die trying to cross the US-Mexico border until root causes are addressed.Solutions Proposed, Solutions OverlookedTwo weeks ago, President Obama publicly addressed the increase in unaccompanied child migrants by allocating $1.4 billion for shelters and transportation and by designating the ""surge"" a federal emergency. While the conditions of the detention facilities where the children are being housed are shocking and deeply concerning, such an action does ultimately expand the militarization and criminalization processes of the US immigration system. The Obama administration has also assured the public that migrants will be processed through immigration court hearings quickly and subsequently deported. While the urge to process migrants through detention facilities rapidly is understandable and appreciated, increasing the speed of trials will only lead to the failure of due process. Immigration attorneys will not have adequate time with their clients and many legitimate asylum claims will go unheard. This need for expedited trials could lead to an extension of Operation Streamline, a dehumanizing process that involves en masse hearings and fast-tracked prosecutions of immigrants.While the response in terms of US foreign policy is unclear, to date, the focus appears to lie in an increased allocation of funds. At least $100 million has been promised to the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to aid in the reintegration of deported migrants and an additional $161.5 million has been allocated to CARSI. While these are positive steps, they are also short term solutions that have been seen before with little to no lasting impact.If we are sincerely concerned about the well-being of the unaccompanied minors, we must be concerned about them before they arrive at our southern border. To increase security at the US and Mexican borders is to push the problem further away, and further into the hands of organized crime. Truly addressing the mass exodus from the south will ultimately have to be more painful for the US, as we benefit from the same structures that expose Mexicans and Central Americans to suffering. To get this right, we will have to rethink economic trade agreements, such as NAFTA and CAFTA, that have failed to deliver what they promised, especially to the working poor. We will have to reassess current US foreign policy in Latin America, and reflect on past involvement so that we can learn from our mistakes. We will have to reexamine our approach to the drug trade, and consider how US policies push billions of dollars into the hands of organized crime. Finally, we will have to reconsider our immigration policies, which at present, separate families and provide no clear, efficient and legal path into the US for workers from Mexico and Central America. All of this will take time. In the meantime, the minors should be given asylum. A Warning: What Happened in the 1990sToday's fear-laden discourse about immigration, along with the short-term view of solutions is all too familiar. In the mid-1990s, punctuated fear surrounding a ""sudden flood"" of immigrants resulted in the militarized US-Mexico border we see today. The economy had dipped, and there was widespread concern that immigrants from Mexico were coming to steal American jobs (despite reliance upon and encouragement of migrant labor for decades). The language is familiar: ""Suddenly a vast flood of illegal immigrants -- Mexicans driven to desperation by some unspeakable and unspecified social catastrophe -- surges across the Southwest border, inundating entire communities as it washes north into the American heartland,"" wrote Sam Dillon, a New York Times reporter in 1995. The panic led to drastic measures. Silvestre Reyes, Border Patrol chief of the El Paso Sector, determined federal efforts to be unsatisfactory and in 1993, established Operation Blockade -- a state-led militarized operation in Texas to secure the border. This act jumpstarted the Clinton administration's 1994 Border Patrol Strategic Plan, designed with assistance from the Center for Low Intensity Conflict. The plan drastically increased border security, and deployed remote desert geographies as weapons designed to teach migrants a lesson -- try if you like, but you might die in the process. The results were deadly. Migrants began dying in California, and then died in Arizona by the hundreds. In the years before the 1994 Strategic Plan was put into practice, the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson investigated an average of 12 cases of migrant fatalities per year. After the plan was implemented, the yearly average of migrant fatalities increased more than tenfold, to over 160. The strategy, while effective in causing deaths, was not successful in preventing people from attempting to cross.Today, once again, we see increased calls for border security, deportation and detention. Once again, we hear refugees and immigrants being described as a horde, mass or flood, rather than human beings. And, as of June 18th of this year, the state government in Texas has once again chosen to take border enforcement into its own hands through the enactment of an order that authorizes the fortification of law enforcement in border counties. If the present echoes the past, these actions could foreshadow further militarization of the border, and more death and suffering.Over the last 13 years, there have been 2,202 recorded migrant deaths in southern Arizona alone. The remains of another 70 have been found in the state since January, and a second year of excavations in Brooks County, Texas, is unearthing the haphazardly buried remains of even more. As father Alejandro Solalinde says in the film Who Is Dayani Cristal?, ""migrants shine a light on the things that need to change."" Migrants have been trying to tell the world for over a decade that something in the system is broken. They cannot survive at home, so they choose to risk their lives in the desert. Migrants the world over are messengers of a failed economic system. When will we listen?"

We need the federal government to step up and secure the border.""The surge in young arrivals has crowded facilities in Texas and led to efforts to move some to other states.Brewer, whose administration in Arizona has taken a tough line on immigration, has slammed as ""dangerous and unconscionable"" a policy that in one instance saw hundreds of migrants detained in Texas released at Arizona bus stations.President Barack Obama has called the flood of illegal immigrant children an urgent humanitarian crisis. It comes as a number of U.S. groups push for policy reform to allow the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States to obtain a pathway to citizenship.Many Republicans complain the federal government is not doing enough to secure the southern border, and they blame the surge of children on Obama's 2012 decision to give temporary relief from deportation to some young people brought to the United States illegally by their parents.Johnson said that did not apply to children arriving from Central America, and that if they were apprehended at the border, they were considered a ""priority"" for deportation proceedings.""We will stem the tide and find a solution to this problem, but until we do, we will deal with their kids in a safe, lawful and humane way,"" he said.

The fighting threatens to rupture the country two and a half years after the end of U.S. occupation.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry during a visit this week pressed Iraqi officials to form an ""inclusive"" government and urged leaders of the autonomous Kurdish region to stand with Baghdad against the onslaught.A session of parliament is planned within a week that will start the process of forming a new government based on the results of elections held in April. Maliki's Shi'ite-led State of Law coalition won the most seats but needs the support of other Shi'ite groups, Sunnis and Kurds to build a government.""We will attend the first session of parliament,"" Maliki said on state television, adding the commitment stemmed from ""loyalty to our people"" and respect for a call by Iraq's foremost Shi'ite clergy.On Friday, Shi'ite Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most respected cleric among Iraq's Shi'ite majority, called for the government formation process to begin.He also warned the demands by mainly Sunni politicians and figures, with ties to the non-ISIL fighting groups who belong to the armed revolt against Baghdad, that calling for an emergency government, not based on the vote, ""represents a coup against the constitution."" The fighting waged by armed Sunni groups, with ISIL blazing the path, has knocked towns and cities across the north and west from the central government's control. Northern Iraq's largest city Mosul fell to Sunni insurgents on June 10.Two days later, Kurdish forces moved into Kirkuk, where violence also flared on Wednesday when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a crowded market entrance, killing six people and wounding 23, police and medics said.The United Nations says more than 1,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed during the Sunni insurgents' advance in Iraq, spearheaded by al Qaeda offshoot ISIL.The figure includes unarmed government troops machine-gunned in mass graves by insurgents, as well as several reported incidents of prisoners killed in their cells by retreating government forces.In addition to the bloodshed, close to a million people have been displaced in Iraq this year. Amin Awad, director of Middle East and North Africa bureau for the U.N. refugee agency, on Wednesday called Iraq ""a land of displacement"".INSURGENTS SEIZE OILFIELDSU.S. President Barack Obama has ruled out sending ground troops back to Iraq where they withdrew in 2011. He has offered up to 300 American military advisers, about 130 of whom have now been deployed. The advisers could gather information about targets for future air strikes although no decision has been taken to start American bombing.Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said late on Tuesday an initial group sent to establish an operations center included intelligence analysts and logistics experts as well as special operations troops.Another 50 U.S. military personnel working in the region are expected to arrive within the next few days to create four additional assessment teams, he said. U.S. military personnel are also flying regular manned and unmanned reconnaissance flights over Iraq.Iraqi state television reported that newly arrived Pentagon advisers met Baghdad's operations commander and agreed to set up a joint operation command.Baghdad is racing against time as the insurgents consolidate their grip on Sunni provinces.On Wednesday, militants overran the Ajeel oil site, 30 km (20 miles) east of Tikrit, which contains at least three small oilfields that produce 28,000 barrels per day, an engineer working at the field said.The engineer said local tribes had taken responsibility for protecting the fields after police withdrew, but that they also left after the nearby town of al-Alam was seized by militants.Ajeel is connected to two pipelines, one running to Turkey's Ceyhan port and the other to the Baiji oil refinery, which remained a frontline early on Wednesday.State TV showed troop reinforcements being flown into the compound by helicopter to fend off the assault on Baiji, a strategic industrial complex 200 km north of Baghdad.Local tribal leaders said they were negotiating with both the Shi'ite-led government and Sunni fighters to allow the tribes to run the plant if Iraqi forces withdraw. One government official said Baghdad wanted the tribes to break with ISIL and other Sunni armed factions, and help defend the compound.The plant has been fought over since last Wednesday, with sudden reversals for both sides and no clear winner so far. BORDER CROSSINGS FALLThe suicide bomber in Kirkuk blew himself up when police stopped him as he tried to enter the crowded market in a mostly Kurdish neighborhood, police said. It was the first such attack since Kurdish forces occupied the city two weeks ago.""The suicide attacker was wearing Kurdish dress. Kurdish security forces suspected he was hiding something under his clothes, and when they tried to stop him at the entrance to search him, he blew himself up,"" a Kurdish security source said.The dead included two Kurdish security personnel.Militants including ISIL and allied Sunni tribes battled Iraqi forces in the town of Yathrib, 90 km north of Baghdad, into the early hours of Wednesday, witnesses and the deputy head of the municipality said. Four militants were killed, they said.Insurgents have surrounded a massive air base nearby, which was known as ""Camp Anaconda"" under U.S. occupation, and struck it with mortars. Witnesses said the air base had been surrounded on three sides.In recent days, Baghdad's grip on the Western frontier with Syria and Jordan has also been challenged.One post on the Syrian border has fallen to Sunni militants and another has been taken over by Kurds. A third crossing with Syria and the only crossing with Jordan are contested, with anti-government fighters and Baghdad both claiming control.For ISIL, capturing the frontier is a step towards the goal of erasing the modern border altogether and building a caliphate across swathes of Iraq and Syria.The group gained another boost in that direction when members of Syria's al Qaeda wing, the Nusra Front, pledged allegiance to it in the border town of Albu Kamal, strengthening its control of the frontier.ISIL supporters posted images online of what they said were Nusra fighters taking an oath of loyalty to ISIL in the town.ISIL and the Nusra Front share hardline Sunni ideology but have periodically fought against each other in Syria.An Iraqi military spokesman said on Tuesday the government had carried out air strikes on a militant gathering in the town of al-Qaim near the Syrian border, which is under the control of the coalition of Sunni armed groups, including ISIL.Locals in al-Qaim and security officials in western Anbar province accused Syria of carrying out the air raid. The Syrian government officially denied the attack, but others in the security establishment there said they had carried out the strike. A senior Iraqi government official also said late Wednesday Syria had carried out the bombardment. If true, the bombardment could preherald a more overt interventionist stance by Iraq's neighbors.Meanwhile, Iraqi security forces and insurgents clashed to the west of Haditha, home of a critical dam, that Sunni fighters wish to claim. Since Qaim and the border fell, the fighters have begun marching up the Euphrates River Valley.They have clashed over the Haditha Dam for four days. ""Things are under the control of the tribes and police and army.

Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) Wednesday as part of a larger higher education package would allow private student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.The Higher Education Affordability Act, introduced by Harkin as chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pension Committee, includes a host of items that aim to address college costs and debt. The entire proposal out of the Senate is largely a Democratic wish list for reauthorizing the Higher Education Act.Private student loans are currently nearly impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, due to a bankruptcy reform package pushed through by Republicans in 2005.""The upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which the HELP Committee has been focused on for nearly a year, presents an historic opportunity for Congress to focus attention on college affordability and accountability, help borrowers with existing student debt, and increase transparency so students and families can make informed decisions,"" Harkin said in a statement. ""This proposal is based on recommendations the Committee has received through its series of bipartisan hearings.""Reforming the policy around bankruptcy and private student loans has been something of a pet project for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who has pushed the idea for the past few years with little success.A House Republican proposal for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, according to a white paper from the Education & Workforce Committee, is largely silent on private student loans, apart from hints at better financial counseling for potential borrowers. Private student loans make up about 15 percent of the overall education debt, according to the Wall Street Journal. The major players in the industry, which has shrunk since the Great Recession, are Wells Fargo, Sallie Mae and Discover Student Loans.Unlike federal loans -- many of which now carry options like income-based repayment, loan forgiveness and extended deferments -- private student debt has no required protections for struggling borrowers. Payments and interest rates for private loans are frequently far higher than those the government demands from graduates, and banks usually ask for a co-signer on private student loans.Under Harkin's proposal, federal loans would still not be eligible for bankruptcy.Private student loan borrowers typically carry more debt than the national average, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Consumer advocates have mocked the rule that bars bankruptcy for private student debt as a ""special circle of bankruptcy hell,"" and the liberal Center for American Progress has floated ideas for making certain student loans eligible for bankruptcy.Efforts by President Barack Obama to address existing student loans has mostly ignored those who have debt from private lenders.Harkin's office is soliciting feedback on the proposal via email at HEAA2014@help.senate.gov."

The 63-year-old leader has also stressed Hindu values that he believes have been undermined by modern secularism.""We will make cleaning up Ganga a people's movement, in keeping with the vision of the prime minister,"" Uma Bharti, minister for water resources, river development and Ganges rejuvenation in Modi's cabinet, told reporters on Thursday.Consultations would be held with non-governmental groups, sadhus, or Hindu holy men, living near the river, ""priests carrying out various rituals around it"", scientists and politicians, she said.""We are seeking the help of everybody. We are looking for a huge mass movement,"" added Bharti, who stoked sectarian controversy in the 1990s over her part in the demolition of a mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya.She promised to come up with detailed proposals in a month and a half for the project, dubbed ""Ganga Manthan"". In the Hindi lexicon, manthan signifies a deep contemplation and churning of facts that leads to enlightenment.A day after his election victory last month Modi traveled to Varanasi to observe a fire ritual in honour of the sacred river.""Now it is time to do my bit for Maa Ganga,"" he said in a speech from one of the ghats where riverside ceremonies are held: ""Maa Ganga is waiting for her son to free her from pollution.""He vowed to clean up India, starting with Varanasi, widely considered Hinduism's holiest city, in time for the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's birth in 2019.Environmental experts have expressed cautious hope that a basin-wide approach advocated by Modi, involving India's northern states and neighbouring Nepal and Bangladesh, would help address issues like reduced meltwater flows into the river caused by the progressive retreat of Himalayan glaciers.Bharti, 55, dismissed media reports that the government would ban spitting in the Ganges as an ""attempt to belittle our serious initiative""."

Rick Scott (R). Florida Republicans launched the testing regime in 2011 at the same time they made Florida the stingiest state in America for unemployment insurance. Claimants had to answer 45 basic questions to complete the test, though they didn't have to get a certain number correct to receive benefits. Advocates charged that Florida's online-only filing system made it overly difficult for the unemployed to receive benefits. The state spent millions of dollars on its system, but an investigation by The Florida Times-Union found that in its first two years, Florida's ""Initial Skills Review"" delayed benefits to 120,000 workers. An earlier investigation by the National Employment Law Project found similar results. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, which administers unemployment claims, shared an earlier version of its skills review with HuffPost last year. (Sample question: ""What relationships can be shown when using multiple graphics with either positive or negative numbers?"")Marty Boscarino of Lantana said she had a hard time establishing her unemployment claim after losing her management job with a telecommunications company in May. ""The system was like locking up on me and I knew it wasn’t my connection,"" Boscarino, 59, told HuffPost. After getting through the test, she struggled to clear up false addresses the system had on file. The online filing scheme had been created, she said, ""to make it harder for people who are truly unemployed and down and out to establish a claim.""Earlier this year, state Sen. Nancy Detert, a Republican who previously supported the skills review, asked during a hearing if the tests had been worth the trouble. ""Are we spending millions to help people, or are we spending millions to annoy unemployed people?” Detert asked, according to the Florida Sun Sentinel. Going forward, the skills review will be optional and the Department of Economic Opportunity will accept claims by phone, according to the Sentinel. "

The quote in the movie is said during a comedic scene on an airplane by the character played by actress Kristen Wiig.The department was seeking to encourage students to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. The FAFSA form is the outlet to obtain federal grants and loans and many states and colleges use it to determine eligibility for other aid.

Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) is so determined to get to the bottom of missing emails from former IRS official Lois Lerner that he is demanding copies of her emails dating back to 1986 -- a time when Nintendo was in, Lionel Richie was hot and there was no such thing as commercialized Internet or email.Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, issued a subpoena to Lee Goodman, head of the Federal Election Commission, on Tuesday directing him to hand over all of Lerner's communications from Jan. 1, 1986, to June 23, 2014. He specifies that this means all emails sent directly to Lerner, those from Lerner and cases in which she was included on the ""cc"" or ""bcc"" fields of an email. Lerner worked for the FEC from 1981 through 2001, but it's unclear why her correspondence from the mid-1980s would have any bearing on the current controversy surrounding her 2012 role in the IRS targeting tea party groups trying to secure tax-exempt status. The IRS lost two years' worth of Lerner's emails from around this period, which has only fueled GOP outrage, though progressive groups were also flagged.Issa's latest subpoena is also puzzling since he's demanding emails from a time when email barely existed. At least, not in any kind of widely accessible format. The first authorized use of commercialized email was in 1988, and it wasn't until 1993 that large network service providers such as AOL started connecting their systems to the Internet and offering email as a globalized form of communication.A request for comment from Issa's spokeswoman was not returned.The subpoena gives Goodman until July 7 to turn over all of Lerner's correspondence from the past 28 years."

While that adjective can certainly seem appropriate when discussing his dazzling sleight of foot and preternatural field awareness, it runs the risk of underselling the precise technique and conscious intent behind the difficult feats that the Argentina star can make seem almost effortless.Such was the case in Argentina's final group-stage game at the 2014 World Cup when Messi froze Nigeria's defense and goalkeeper with an inch-perfect free kick. The goal came in the closing moments of the first half and was Messi's second in Argentina's 3-2 win over Nigeria at Estadio Beira-Rio in Porto Alegre on Wednesday. After winning a free kick approximately 25 yards from goal in first-half stoppage time, Messi stepped up to the ball. Between him and the goal there was a wall of Nigeria defenders. There were four other Nigeria defenders in the penalty area as well five Argentina players. Yet the four-time Ballon d'or winner might as well have been all alone on the field when he unfurled his left-footed shot. (GIF via @FlyByKnite)In addition to clearing the wall of defenders just 10 yards away, the ball needed to elude Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, who had not surrendered a goal in the tournament before this match. With one purposeful swing of his left leg, Messi ensured the ball did both, arcing it over the wall and also bending it toward the near post. (GIF via @FlyByKnite)The reaction of Enyeama after the ball found its way into his net perfectly summed up the helplessness that Messi can make opponents feel. (GIF via @Barcelonka_1899)With Argentina in the lead and both teams in position to advance into the Round of 16, Messi was subbed out of the match in the 63rd minute. Before leaving the field, Messi shared a heartwarming moment with Enyeama, who didn't seem to have any hard feelings about letting up his first goals in Brazil. "

Since her record-breaking run this spring, she's traveled and fielded plenty of calls for interviews. The Huffington Post caught up with the champ by phone to talk about all the things we've always wanted to know about ""Jeopardy!"" And, as expected, she gave us a treasure trove of tidbits about what it's like to be on the game show. Herewith, 13 things Julia Collins discovered as a ""Jeopardy!"" contestant:You don't get the money right away. I don't get my winnings until the end of August, which is roughly 120 days after my first air date.A week of shows films in a single day. They're filmed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Tuesdays, there are 13 people including the returning champion and Wednesdays there are 12. On taping day, contestants arrive at 8:00 a.m. One nice thing about being from a different time zone is that you don’t feel like it’s that early, which is good because I’m not much of a morning person. Everybody gets their makeup done and you have a discussion about what’s going to happen when you’re on.You don't know what show you'll be on when you show up. Everybody puts their name on index cards, placed face down on a table and standards and practices -- an outside firm that does all the legal compliance -- and they pick two people five minutes before the show tapes and those are the challengers of that game. So it’s a surprise. You don’t know what game you’re going to play in until basically right before it happens. There's (potentially) a lot of downtime. Everybody else who is waiting to play is in the audience during the game [being taped]. Two people get held over to the next day, which is what happened to me; I had watched a full week of games before I played. There's a lunch break after the third game and it's like three, three-and-a-half hours between when you get there and when the first show tapes, so you have a lot of time to talk to the other contestants. I got to know the people who played the week before me because I sat with them all day. I got to talk to the woman that I beat in my first game; I sat in the audience with her, had lunch with her and then talked to her again the next morning. People who want to be on ""Jeopardy!"" are a self-selecting group so you have that in common, that’s a really fun part of being on the show.You get to rehearse. The practice games are super fun because they’re easy so they really build your confidence. You get to write your name on the screen, get the buzzer and get the rhythm and feel for everything. I thought that was a really, really fun part of the show. You get a feeling for what happens and what it feels like to be up there. Ever seen a ""Hometown Howdy""? They're mostly in smaller markets but mine played a little bit once I won like 15 games. They're kinda funny. Mine was, ""Hey Windy City, I’m Julia Collins from Kenilworth, watch me blow away the competition on 'Jeopardy!'"" It’s kind of nerve-wracking. That was the scariest thing about being on the show. Everything was less stressful after that. People -- surprise! -- come out of the woodwork when you start winning. It’s been a chance to reconnect with people I don’t talk to as much. I’ve had cousins who I’m not in close touch with emailing me a lot. Rosie O’Donnell followed me on Twitter, which was pretty fun. I think it’s hilarious when people take pictures of their faces in front of the TV watching me. John Irving [who was the answer to the Final Jeopardy answer she lost on] sending me ""Cider House Rules"" was really unexpected and very kind. He made the effort to write this nice note, find my address and go to the post office. It was just very kind. People were very kind. I don’t know what I’d really do that for people I don’t know and that so many people made that effort was very touching. The other hardest part of being on the show was ... Coming up with stuff for the interview portion was probably the hardest thing. There's a contestant coordinator who is in charge of coordinating the stories [that you tell at the beginning of the show]. He'd always remind me to think of more stories. I wore this ring most of the time I was on the show that my grandmother gave me and I was like we could talk about that, and he said no, somebody else just talked about this cameo brooch that she got from her mother and he was like, “no more jewelry from relatives.” They try not to repeat the stories too frequently because a lot of people have done the same things. I got a little bit better about how to present something that was going to be okay for the show; you had to have something mildly entertaining. It's intense. I made three separate trips to Los Angeles. I went first in mid-January and I was on the second taping day of the week and went home after my first five games, so I had a little break for a couple weeks. Then I went back the first week in February and played 10 games and then went home on Thursday and flew back on Monday to play five more games on Tuesday. That was pretty intense. It’s exhausting. It’s mentally exhausting, standing all day -- which I know people do for their jobs all the time, but I assume people who do that wear more supportive shoes than I did, which I imagine helps.The panel of judges is just what you'd imagine it would be. There is a table of people facing the stage, whom Alex calls the judges. At least one person from the legal team is there and then I think some of the writers, but I don't totally know who they are. The only person who the contestants ever have any interaction with is the legal person who comes over and writes down your Final Jeopardy wager. Once you’ve written it on the screen and press enter, the legal person comes over and writes it down in case there is an equipment malfunction so that’s its official. How to do well at ""Jeopardy!"" Learn as much as you can or have learning be an every day part of your life. There’s a lot of stuff I know from “The Simpsons,” which is a very silly place to learn stuff but I don't think I've ever gotten a bad fact from there. Try to learn things any way you can. Before you go on, study the areas you feel you need help in. Try not to get too stressed out. Some people get really frustrated or lose their cool and confidence so they don’t get off to a great start. It’s not the end of the world if you get it wrong. Alex Trebek is with it ... and helps write the answers. He’s very good at what he does, which is to make it fun, keep the game going, make sure the contestants feel comfortable, keep it entertaining. You don't really get a lot of time to talk to him, though. He makes jokes, he’s very bright and very sharp. During the game, he gives you much more feedback than what you see on TV. There's a lot more nonverbal interaction with the contestants. What you talk about at the end of the show varies quite a bit. There was a woman from Toronto and they talked about Rob Ford. One man was very into Alex’s suits so that’s what we talked about at the end of the show. He helps with the answers. He'll sit with the writers and go over stuff. He'll make suggestions about wording to help out the contestants. Most of the writers have been there a long time and he’s been there for a long run so he has a good sense of what’s going to work. And a bonus: How to remember things better! It helps me to write down everything, even if I don’t go back and look at the notes, the act of physically writing something makes me a lot more likely to remember it. I’m a big believer in cognitive benefits of hand writing. And I don't know how you develop this, but it helps to remember the context I learn something in. If I don’t have some reason to remember something, I’m a lot less likely to remember it. I was a history major in college; I like history a lot so I know a fair amount about it, so when I learn more history it fits into this broader framework of things I already know.This interview has been edited and condensed."
