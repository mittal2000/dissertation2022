If you're in New York City, there are donation centers, pop-up relief stations and a myriad of ways to volunteer. One of the best things you can do if you're in an area that was hit by the superstorm is patronize the small businesses that may be struggling. Neighborhoods like Red Hook in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side in Manhattan could use our support right now. But if you're not in the Northeast you can still help. Of course, donations to The American Red Cross or the Salvation Army are valuable, but how about shopping for a cause? The holiday season is coming up, so get started on your holiday shopping and know that part of the money you spend is going to those in need. E-tailers like eBay, Stylebop and Penfield are donating percentages of their proceeds to The Red Cross, so get to spending and know that you're helping those in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.

We can only imagine that today is an extraordinarily trying day for both of you. Waiting for the votes to be tallied and the results to trickle in isn't easy for the general public; it can only be a bigger stressor to the candidates themselves.As some 50 or so percent of eligible Americans cast their ballots today -- and plenty of others struggle to reach their polling sites or return their absentee ballots in time in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy -- you face the anxiety-ridden culmination of your candidacy.We're sure you can't concentrate on much of anything beside early predictions and voter-turnout calculations, but should you find yourself looking for a welcome distraction, we thought we'd offer you the following healthy suggestions:Get in a workout. Take your BlackBerry, if you must. But a little exercise -- whether it's on the basketball court or the elliptical machine -- can zap stress and anxiety, even after you've stopped sweating.Take a nap. It might not seem like the ideal time to check out, but here at Healthy Living, we're big proponents of napping at work. All you need is 30 minutes to have a more productive and focused second half of the day. And considering the job you're vying for, you'll probably want to sleep as much as possible while you still can.Try not to stress eat. Research shows that when our bodies are under stress, we naturally crave rich, fatty, sugary, calorie-laden foods -- things that taste good in the moment but only bring fleeting relief and can add much longer-lasting inches and pounds. Instead, try ""eating like athletes, for physical and mental strength,"" as a registered dietitian put it so well to Men's Health. That means a little less of this:    in favor of, perhaps, some fruit this afternoon, gentlemen?Governor Romney, please don't overdo it on the Cherry Coke Zero. Even though it's calorie-free, diet sodas have been linked to weight gain, diabetes, stroke and heart attack, not to mention that those ""natural flavors"" on the ingredients label might come from places you'd never expect. If you're going to drink, do so in moderation. Governor Romney, we know, as is prescribed by your faith, that you abstain from all alcohol use. President Obama, we've all read about the occasional beer summit and the hyped release of the White House's own brew (not to mention from your medical records), that you've been known to enjoy a drink from time to time. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans define ""moderate"" drinking as up to one drink per day for women and up to two for men. Sipping more than that in an effort to quell those ""polls are closing"" nerves puts you at risk for high blood pressure, liver damage, memory problems and more, according to the CDC.Stay away from the cigarettes. President Obama, please don't go sneaking a cigarette today. We know you've been tobacco-free lately, however we also know that stress is one of the top reasons smokers cite when asked why it's so tough to kick the habit for good. Sorry, but we're definitely on the first lady's side on this one.We could spend even longer suggesting healthy habits for you to turn to for relief today, like one of our favorite stress-busters, a massage, but we know you don't have much time. There are early prediction polls to attend to, after all. Good luck and good health, The HuffPost Healthy Living Team"

Don't buy into the holiday travel hype that it's too late score a travel deal over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.Instead of just going online and searching for peak holiday weekend travel days, I'm sharing my insider tips for how you can make it home for the holidays, score a beach vacation and avoid those seasonal mark ups.1. Travel in the Off Season If you're traveling for leisure this winter, pack a coat and get ready for some culture. It's the off-season in colder climates but not for museums, theater and restaurants. Montreal has winter sports, its own ice village and the famous Montreal en Lumiere festival. Book a 2-night minimum stay through December 31, 2012 and get half off the second night, plus transit tickets and a coupon book with discounts worth up to $200. Or think Iceland: You can fly to Iceland from Boston from just $555 on Icelandair, or continue on to Europe with a stopover in Reykjavik. Head to Chicago, which is teeming with museums, restaurants and winter events. Hotel occupancy last December was just 55.4 percent, meaning you get to avoid the crowds. Go in early February, and you can take advantage of the great deals at Chicago's Restaurant Week.2. Pick Your Dates All November and December travel dates are not the same. Rates vary wildly from day to day and you'll find the greatest savings if you travel on the actual holidays -- Thanksgiving Day, Christmas and Christmas Eve offer the most savings. Remember, turkey tastes good any time of day. If you're traveling for leisure, then look to travel during that ""dead week"" between Thanksgiving and Christmas for maximum savings.3. Find a Real Travel Deal Many packages are called ""deals,"" but it pays to read the fine print. Free hot chocolate doesn't make a deal. Look for how much you are saving on the room rate and then look for additional value adds. Remember to use all your resources when looking for a deal. From flash sales to Twitter promotions, offers come in hourly. If you need help weeding them out, PeterGreenberg.com reviews all the offers and publishes the day's best in the Daily Deal feature.4. Look for Freebies It's nice to score a deal, but the best deals are actually free. This week, it's your last chance to enter the Fall Sweepstakes, live until November 8. One lucky person can win the Grand Prize: a 4-night, all inclusive stay for two at the Hard Rock Hotel Cancun with $500 airfare credit and a 30-minute massage.

3,WEDDINGS,The Paper Doll Bride,"Sandy Malone, Contributor
Owner of Sandy Malone Weddings & Events, Star of TLC's ""Weddin...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-paper-doll-bride_us_5b9c7b94e4b03a1dcc7f121e,"When she called the shop to make her appointment, they told her size wouldn't be a problem, they had a way around it.  They would ""paper doll"" her.",2012-11-06,Women making adjustment to wedding gown in professional fashion designer studio,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c7b942100003100c52484.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I just finished a conference call with a client that so horrified me that I had to sit down and write this blog immediately. You are going to be just as shocked as I was when you learn about the cruel and torturous process of ""paper dolling"" brides who can't fit into sample size wedding gowns.My client, a lovely bride, went shopping for her wedding gown at what is supposed to be the nicest bridal boutique in Waltham, Mass. She did it properly -- made an appointment and brought some girlfriends with her to give her their honest opinions -- and she was very excited to start the process. Wedding gown shopping makes the engagement start to feel really REAL and it's a big deal.Like most women in the world, this client isn't a bridal sample size eight (really a four) and there was no way she was going to be able to actually properly try on anything in the fancy boutique. I ran into the same problem when I got married. Most of the time, they have you put on the gown and it won't zip -- heck, the fabric won't even begin to meet in the back. So they clip it to your bra or foundation garment to hold it up in place so you see -- sort of -- what it will look like when you wear it. Not the most flattering or ego-boosting experience around, but it does get the job done.But enough about me... my bride's experience eclipses mine completely.First off -- she's not fat. She's average. When she called the shop to make her appointment, they told her size wouldn't be a problem, they had a way around it. They would ""paper doll"" her. Not knowing what that meant and being too shy to ask (visions of the toilet-paper bridal shower game swirling), she readily agreed and made the appointment and invited her friends along.Upon arrival at the salon, she was whisked away to a dressing room to try on her first picks. She changed into the robe provided, and then the process began to unfold, hideously, in front of her. Remember, she's in a room that has three full walls of mirrors, and then a curtain for a doorway. It probably had a platform -- most of them do at the nice shops. They had her take the robe off and began to pin the dress to the front of her, as if she were a real paper doll. She didn't actually get into the dress at all, but rather, they clipped it onto her bra and undies and attached it to her all the way down. Then they proceeded to put a veil and jewelry and the whole she-bang on her as if she was really a paper doll being dressed up in a wedding gown. Weird.There's only one major problem with this strategy -- paper dolls are one dimensional and ONE-SIDED. So from the front view, she looked nice (sorta... she said the whole experience was so bizarre that trying to process how the dress looked became secondary). But from the back, her ass was hanging out! No really, there was nothing covering her backside at all other than her panties. And she realized when she turned to face the sales associates that they were receiving a 270 degree panoramic view of her butt in the wall mirrors behind her. The salesgirls oohed and ahhed about how pretty she looked but the bride was literally speechless, and mortified. Her friends, hearing the clerks' enthusiasm, wanted to see and clamored for a look from the other side of the curtain. Before the bride could even open her mouth to say ""NO,"" the sales associate whipped back to the curtain to let everybody standing outside the doorway have a look. At her nearly-bare backside. From every conceivable angle.Really? REALLY? The poor girl was mortified. As she faced them, they were seeing the least flattering view of her tush in a wide-screen. If she turned away from them, she was sticking her ass in their faces. She was trapped, speechless, frozen, and traumatized. Fortunately, her girlfriends were equally horrified and one of them actually reached out and pulled the curtain closed before anybody else wandering around in the bridal salon dressing area could have a peepshow too. But the bride was done. She got un-paper dolled as quickly as possible and hopped back into her street clothes. The shopping adventure was finished for the day, despite her earlier plans to visit several bridal shops. At that moment, she never wanted to try on another wedding gown ever again. She couldn't even look the salespeople in the eye as she beat feet out of that place, fighting a genuine anxiety attack the entire way. Oh. My. God.I honestly thought I'd heard every horror story possible from the more than 400 brides I've sent down the aisle in the past five-plus years. This one was completely new, even for me. Fortunately, this bride's wedding isn't for another 18 months so she's going to take my advice and wait a few months to let the PTSD abate before she tries shopping again (at a different boutique). And she will make sure that nobody plans to paper doll her at the next shop.You have a right to dignity and privacy and modesty when you are gown shopping and any salesperson who doesn't treat you with the proper respect doesn't deserve the immense commission she's going to make off of selling you that gown. Even if you like the dress, go somewhere else to buy it if you are treated in a manner that you deem to be inappropriate. Don't let them humiliate you or intimidate you. And remember, if the words ""paper doll"" come up, RUN!Until next time, happy wedding planning from Weddings in Vieques and Weddings in Culebra! Sandy"

So, when my wife and I started thinking about a far longer trip -- to Japan -- we knew we'd need to find a way to claw our way up to greater comfort.For a variety of reasons -- not least our fondness for London as both destination and travel hub -- we have long flown British Airways almost exclusively, and we use a BA-branded credit card. This has paid off in frequent-flier miles and silver card status, which means we're even more determined to stick with BA to keep the miles and privileges coming. Luckily, we like BA's service and schedules, so we don't feel trapped.Hence, we'd been hoarding miles, and when it was time to book our Japan tickets we found ourselves with hundreds of thousands of them -- plus a two-for-one voucher. The original idea had been to travel in business class (what BA calls Club World), which offers comfortable flat beds and excellent airport lounges with good drinks and snacks, as well as pre-flight meals for night departures. But that two-for-one voucher got us to thinking that we ought to treat ourselves to first class for most of the trip (apart from the relatively short New York-London leg, for which we booked Club), and we redeemed 200,000 miles and spent about $3,000 in taxes and fees for tickets that together would have cost -- get this -- the better part of $50,000 to purchase, about the same as the 2012 United States median household income.Fifteen hundred dollars apiece is not exactly cheap, but the same itinerary would have cost more than $2,000 each in cramped economy class (direct flights to Tokyo are less costly, but London was an immutable part of our itinerary).Here's some of what we got for our outlay, apart from a peek into a different world of travel.After our five days in London (I've written about some of the afternoon snacks and suppers we enjoyed there), we arrived at Heathrow airport's Terminal 5 at about 7 a.m. to find a team of red-jacketed porters waiting to haul our luggage all the way from the drop-off point to check-in; that might have been as far as 50 yards. I needed to visit the tax rebate desk, so my wife was installed in a comfy alcove to wait. A good start.BA's regular business/silver-card-holder lounges at Heathrow (and at JFK) are uncommonly good, but the vast Concorde Room lounge beats them to pieces. For one thing, there's direct access from the airport security gantlet-run, not a trivial consideration when you're feeling dizzy with relief at not having triggered the metal detector. Once inside, we found no buffet, no automatic coffee machine. Rather, waiters deliver anything you want anywhere in the lounge, including a terrace -- indoors, but because it is in the open space of the terminal it has an almost al fresco feel -- and a restaurant with intimate wood-paneled booths. (If the restaurant booths are not private enough for you, you can reserve a ""cabana"" with a day-bed, shower, toilet, TV and bowl of fruit. We expected a long layover on the way home, so we booked one of these for the return trip.) Our meal was a simple one -- good coffee, freshly made toast with Tiptree jam and acceptable pastries -- but many fliers were putting away colossal hot breakfasts. Some had already started on the booze -- the wine selection was tempting -- but we thought we'd wait at least until we'd boarded the plane.There were 14 seat-pods in the Boeing 777 cabin, and the atmosphere was hushed and cozy. The environment was much enhanced by subtle lighting and expansive railway-train-like rectangular windows with electrically controlled shades. These are a clever illusion, of course: Each extends over two standard airplane windows. The pods had individual clothes closets and plenty of elbow room, with deep shelves for the Anya Hindmarch toiletries bags and the junk we cannot travel without. And, as expected, the leg room was for all practical purposes infinite. For once, the electronics -- lights, seat/bed adjustment -- were easy to figure out. From the moment we boarded, all staff addressed us by name without obvious reference to a cheat sheet. Dinner is served gracefully, with no cart and no timetable: You can order from any part of the fairly diverse menu at any point in the flight, and your table will be deployed and draped with crisp linen -- and set for two if you like, since the pods have a guest seat which becomes the foot of the bed at sleepy-time. The wines were terrific and included Laurent-Perrier Grand Siècle Champagne and a more than respectable 14-year-old Bordeaux. Food varied in quality (whatever the class, this was an airplane): When we ordered toward the end of the flight (which arrived in Japan at the scary hour of 4:45 a.m.), my wife's leek and potato soup with smoked salmon was delicious and fresh-tasting, but my full English breakfast was distressingly dry and overcooked. The fine chocolates were from London's Artisan du Chocolat, a favorite of ours. We were supplied with pajamas, slippers and a comfortable eyeshade that didn't squash my nose. When it was time to use those things, a crew member turned our seats into beds and made them up with an under-pad and a warm but lightweight comforter in a pretty white cotton cover strewn with golden squares. BA's business class beds are a miracle compared to a chair, but at six feet I barely fit into them. Here, I found three or four inches of clearance above my head, and my feet didn't touch the end of the pod. We slept solidly and comfortably for more than five hours of the 11-hour flight, admittedly with pharmacological assistance. If we'd wanted to look at television, we'd have had our choice of hundreds of movies and other programs and a 15-inch screen to view them on.In the old BOAC days, when I started traveling abroad, cabin crews too often seemed stern and sullen. That is no longer the norm at BA, but as first class passengers we really were cossetted, as we might have been in a good restaurant: a discreet eye was kept on us, and needs were generally anticipated. We certainly never had to push the call button.With variations, this pattern was repeated on the following two legs of the trip. Departing Tokyo from Narita airport, we weren't on BA's home turf and I can't blame the company for the ordinariness of the Japan Airlines lounge (though it did offer massages, good croissants from Paris-based but ubiquitous Maison Kayser and little warming ovens stocked with hot towels). Once on board, all was well; one of the crew greeted us with, ""Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Schneider -- we've been expecting you."" Corny, but kind of nice. Food, again, was up and down (the down including fridge-cold cheese), but everything else was impeccable. Owing to appalling weather, the flight departed hours late and there was no point in making use of our cabana at Heathrow; we took a quick break and boarded our final flight home to New York. This was a Boeing 747; although the seats were the same, the pods they were installed in didn't seem quite as spacious owing to the more tapered cabin. We'd clearly become entirely spoiled. And upon landing at JFK, the spoiling continued: Because of the early arrival of a full flight from another destination the immigration line was very, very long, yet BA found a way to expedite the process for the dozen or so first-class passengers. Our luggage arrived quickly, too.We had a great time, but there was a paradox: Somehow, the peace and quiet, the comfortable seats/beds and the warm hospitality of first class travel made the flights seem about 30 per cent shorter than they do in the back of the plane (and genuinely eased jet lag). Yet it was all such a pleasure that we regretted sensing the time slip through our fingers.It is ridiculous to ask whether this kind of flying is worth the cash price of the fare: If the cost doesn't make you feel queasy, then perhaps you can afford it (or are profligate). It is not ridiculous, however, to ask whether my wife and I had any regrets about exchanging so many hard-earned frequent-flier miles for our tickets, and the answer is no. We would -- we shall -- do it again some time."

The 27-year-old was undergoing her third liposuction when she suffered a fatal hemorrhage, The Telegraph reports. Nascimento's aunt, Enedida Nascimento, alerted the police after it took 10 days for the Green Hill Hospital in Sao Paulo to report her death, and they're now investigating whether or not she died of a perforated kidney or a punctured liver during the surgery on October 19th. (A perforated kidney would indicate that she died before the operation was complete, and the surgery was completed to hide the mistake, according to Fox.)""She was obsessed with her looks. She was always telling me how fat she thought she was,"" the model's aunt said. ""But she didn't tell me about this latest liposuction. If she had told me I wouldn't have let her.

Nascimento was a successful television presenter in Brazil (she appeared on a Brazilian variety show entitled O Melhor do Brasil) and was also studying biomedicine. Her family's attorney has told the press that they suspect medical malpractice was at play because of the time lapse in reporting her death. If this is true, the surgeon could face manslaughter charges. “Our intention is to find out if the surgery went ahead with her alive or after she had died to try to hide an unsuccessful attempt to save her,"" Evandro Lemos, the police chief spearheading the investigation, said.This isn't the first time that plastic surgery has gone wrong...Want more?
