The suspect, who killed his girlfriend in Baltimore earlier in the day, was apparently motivated by the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown.

Not much is known about the gunman, who was identified by officials as Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, except that he was a suspected gang member from Baltimore who allegedly posted on social media that he wanted revenge for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two black men that died at the hands of police.According to the New York Daily News, Brinsley, who was pronounced dead, had ties to the '""Black Guerilla Family"" prison gang, which is also known as ""Black Family"" or the ""Black Vanguard."" The gang was formed in 1966 by Black Panther member George Jackson at the San Quentin State Prison in California, and soon grew into a multi-million dollar business with chapters stretching from Los Angeles to Kansas City and Detroit.“BGF has been talking about getting back at cops for Eric Garner and Ferguson,” a source told the News, which also reported on a suspected Black Guerrilla Family plot to kill NYPD officers in the wake of a grand jury decision not to indict an officer in Eric Garner’s chokehold death earlier this summer.A federal law enforcement official, however, told the Baltimore Sun that Brinsley had no known ties to the BGF.The gang is affiliated with leftist groups, including the Black Liberation Army, Symbionese Liberation Army, Weather Underground, Red Guerrilla Family, and Chicano Liberation Front, and one of its stated missions is the overthrow of the U.S. government. Gang members identify with tattoos and symbols including the letters ""B-G-F,"" the corresponding numbers of the alphabet 2-7-6, a crossed machete and rifle, and a black dragon climbing a San Quentin prison tower, according to Police Mag. It is structured on a paramilitary ranking system (its leader holds the rank of Supreme Commander), and many of its members use the Swahili language to communicate.The gang still operates today under James (Doc) Holiday, who was incarcerated in 1987. According to Police Mag, BGF actively recruits members from other gangs (Crips, Bloods, N.O.I., Black Panthers, or members of the 415 gang) and encourages them to continue to claim their prior affiliation. Doing so allows the BGF to operate covertly within the prison system.Last year, Baltimore officials cracked down on the gang because it essentially took over the Baltimore City Detention Center, after members allegedly extorted people, intimidated witnesses and dealt drugs with the aid of correction officers. Five corrections officers, two inmates, and a kitchen worker are currently on trial in the ongoing racketeering conspiracy case.The Baltimore FBI office issued a memo on Friday warning that the BGF was targeting ""white cops"" in Maryland, per the Sun. The memo, based on a contact who had given officials reliable information in the past, said the plan was to target white officers in order to ""send a message."""

That is why we're here!""And then, at a moment indicated by leaders, hundreds of protestors fell to the ground for a four and a half minute die-in -- each minute signifying one of the hours that Michael Brown's body lay in the steamy streets of Ferguson, Missouri, last August.During the die-in, clergy were encouraged to hold hands, stand in a circle in the center of the protestors, and pray. We each prayed silently, so I don't know what others prayed. Here is the content of my own prayer, in spirit if not in the exact words:Spirit of life and love and justice, I thank you for this day. I thank you for this day when thousands of people of all races stand together longing for justice, longing for a time when Black Lives Matter, and living our intention to turn that longing into reality. I thank you for the courage of each one of these nonviolent protestors, who each overcame fears of their own to be here.I pray for the families of all those who have been killed by police, who have been destroyed by people who should have protected them, for the grieving parents whose aching hearts will never overcome their losses. May they see their loved ones' value resurrected in these actions.I thank you for the black and brown people who are here today, for they are most at risk taking this action. They are most at risk everyday, in schools and stores, workplaces and city streets. I pray for their well-being. May they be free from harm.I grieve for the young people who are not here, whose lives have been shriveled by violence and racism, whose school experience is more like prison, whose support for bold living is minimal, who have not found their way to belief that anything they do matters. May they find the arms of loving community, of elders who encourage and support their strength, and thrive in it.I thank you especially for the amazing leadership of this action, young Black activists, whose courage gave courage to the thousands who are here, whose wisdom structured a safe and effective action, whose love gives voice to our collective cries for justice. May all that they give to the world be returned to them over and over.I thank you for the courage of white people, who showed up today in trust and in hope that our speaking up could make a difference, who committed ourselves to justice and peace for all. May we know a strength and hope far deeper than the comfort and privilege which is afforded to us simply for being white, a strength and hope grounded in unity and truth and compassion.I thank you for the Bloomington Police Department, and the Mall of America Security Force, for their willingness to keep things calm and peaceful. May their humanity continue to shine in the difficult months ahead, as we work towards systemic change when police are accountable to the same laws as other citizens.I thank you for the children who are here, children learning in the cradle that the adults they trust can be trusted to speak and work for justice, children inheriting a new understanding of what it means to grow up as part of a diverse people, united in commitment to the well-being of all.Spirit of love and justice, my heart is broken for all of the killing, for all of the oppression, for all of the destruction of life's potential. My heart is healed by the resistance, by the courage to take action, by the leadership which I experience today. May this day wake us all up, help us all to know more clearly what it means to be human. Amen.As I write this the next day, in the early morning light of the Solstice, I pray that our nation is turning towards the light. And this morning, with sadness in my heart, I add the grieving families of killed police officers in Brooklyn to my prayers, knowing that these families will now, too, face a lifetime with a hole in their hearts.May we all find peace together. May we all find justice together. May we be one nation together."

The country tries to attract tourists by touting its sandy beaches, temperate climate, spas, and resort hotels. It's tough competition. I met a couple of Romanians who said straight out that they prefer to vacation along Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. And Turkey is a more popular destination for European and American travelers.Tanase Barde, along with two colleagues, owns two hotels on the Romanian coast. They're located near the town of Mangalia in two resorts named after Roman gods: Jupiter and Venus. They're seasonal hotels. Even though we were meeting in season -- at a restaurant in the Black Sea port city of Constanta in May 2013 -- business, he told me, was not particularly good.""The Romanian state doesn't help businessmen,"" he told me. ""No one wants to help. No one wants to develop. Everybody just wants to take.""Barde put much of the blame on Romania's political culture. ""I'm very disappointed about the evolution of Romania,"" Barde observed. ""The people involved in politics are at a very low level of education, of knowledge, of vision. We don't have an evolution. We have an involution. This has happened because we can't talk about democracy without responsibility, without education. It's very good to have democracy. It's the only way, and I don't know another way. But if we don't have responsibility, if we don't have a minimal education, then democracy can be very bad. And this is what has happened in Romania now.""Barde, who by profession is an engineer, tried his hand at politics. Some time after the changes in December 1989, he joined the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party. Five years later, he was elected to parliament and served one term. He was happy about some of the changes that his party was able to push through in coalition with the Liberals.""At that time, we adopted the law on privatization, which helped us moved further along on our road to Europe,"" he recalled. ""We also adopted the law on the banking system. In 1996 when we came into power, we had very big problem with the banking system. Iliescu and his party stole a lot of money because we didn't have good clear laws and rules. So, at that time, we adopted these laws. Laws like these made it difficult for Romania to backtrack from its commitments to join the EU.""But ultimately, politics was not for him. He had a falling out with his party's leadership. He jumped ship to Traian Basescu's Democratic Party, but couldn't make a go of it there either. So he went into business.Some of the frustrations that Barde with politics have carried over into the business world. He complains about the lack of infrastructure devoted to tourism. This makes it very difficult to attract foreign tourists to his hotels. But it goes beyond the physical shortcomings.""We don't know how to treat tourists,"" he confesses. ""When I say this, I'm talking about the ordinary people: the people who come to the table to serve you. They don't have the right attitude. They're not happy to serve you. It's a very big problem.""I told him that I'd encountered that attitude a few times in Romanian restaurants and hotels. ""It's also a big difference between Turkey and Romania,"" he continued. ""You were in Turkey? The Turkish people from my point of view are number one in tourism. They are very happy if you sit down at a table. If you ask for something, he doesn't say, 'I don't have that.' He says, 'Okay, okay,' he goes out to buy it, and then he gives it to you.""He's trying to change that image with his hotels. ""We try to offer good service,"" he concluded. ""We carefully select our staff. We stay in the season all the time there. We invest.""  The InterviewDo you remember where you were and what you were thinking when you heard about the fall of the Berlin Wall?  I was a student at that time. I was in Bucharest, staying in a workers' neighborhood. Of course I was very glad to hear about the fall of the Berlin Wall. My father had been in prison when he was 12 years old so --Really, he was in prison when he was 12 years old?  It was something like prison. They took the whole family from their village. And they put them in a place where there was nothing. Nothing. Just the earth. And they said, ""You live here from now on.""  Ah, yes, I heard about this.  They made him cut reeds when he was 12. I grew up hearing stories about this period. And that's why I was very happy to hear about the fall of the Berlin Wall.  You grew up here in Constanta but studied in Bucharest?  Yes.  And what were you studying?  Electronics and telecommunications. I'm a telecommunication engineer. After I graduated, I worked in the national telecommunication system. At that time, we had only one national telecommunication system.  Were you also in Bucharest on December 21?  I was in my last year at the university. For those of us in the last year, we were allowed to finish school early to prepare for the final exam. We had three or four months to prepare for that exam. So, in December I was here in Constanta.  And what happened here in Constanta at that time?  The people went out on the street. Everybody went over to the headquarters of the Communist Party.  Is that where the city hall is now?  Yes. They broke down the doors. They went inside, and they declared the end of the Communist Party and the Securitate. Everybody was happy.  Were there any casualties? Did anybody get killed?  Not in the Constanta area, but in Cernavoda. Three or four young people were killed there. But it was a mistake. Here in Constanta the revolution was very peaceful. In Bucharest there was a big fight. Also in Timisoara and in Sibiu. But not here.  Did you participate? Did you go inside the building?  Yes, I was in the front.  How did it feel?  I felt happy. And hopeful. I thought everything would be shining and beautiful and free.  Did your parents also participate?  No. My father was at work at that time. After a few hours, I went to see him and asked if he'd heard that Ceausescu had fallen. He'd heard.  And then what happened?

Kelly appeared on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday to discuss the killing of two NYPD officers. When asked by host George Stephanopoulos if it's fair for critics to partially blame de Blasio for the death of the two cops, Kelly said the mayor had set off a ""firestorm"" by raising concerns over his son's safety.“Obviously, there's a lot of emotion involved when two police officers are killed,"" Kelly said. ""When the mayor made statements about how they had to train his son, who is biracial, to be careful when he’s dealing with the police, I think that set off this latest firestorm."" On Saturday, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot dead in their squad car by a gunman identified by police as 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley. Brinsley had reportedly posted on social media boasting of his plan to kill two cops in revenge for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police. The head of the largest police union in New York City, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, accused de Blasio and those protesting the deaths of Brown and Garner of inciting violence that led to Saturday's shooting.""There's blood on many hands tonight,"" NYC PBA president Pat Lynch said Saturday. ""That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor.""Kelly served as police commissioner from 2002 to 2013, and is a staunch defender of the city's stop and frisk policy -- which de Blasio promised to reform during his mayoral campaign.""Quite frankly, the mayor ran an anti-police campaign last year when he ran for mayor,” Kelly told ABC. ""You're talking about his opposition to stop and frisk,"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""Is that what you think was anti-police?""“I think a lot of the rhetoric was -- at a time when the police had a 70 percent approval rating,"" Kelly replied. ""Obviously that’s not the case now.""Kelly's remarks echoed those of former New York Gov. George Pataki (R), who disparaged both the mayor and Attorney General Eric Holder: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani also criticized de Blasio, accusing him of ""allowing protests to get out of control"" following a grand jury's decision to not indict police officer Daniel Pantaleo for using a fatal chokehold on Garner. ""If I was in the situation that Mayor de Blasio is in, and I feel sorry that he's in this situation, I would give a speech to the police department and I would explain that maybe I was wrong about a few things,"" he said during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday.""Giuliani also blamed the murder of the two officers on anti-police propaganda.""We've had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police,"" Giuliani said. ""I don't care how you want to describe it -- that's what those protests are all about.""Giuliani said that protests across the country after the deaths of Brown and Garner, even if they were peaceful, had led people to think that the police were bad. ""That is completely wrong. Actually, the people who do the most for the black community in America are the police,"" he said.Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, de Blasio praised the slain officers and strongly condemned the ""heinous individual"" responsible for the attack.""When a police officer is murdered, it tears at the foundation of our society,"" he said. ""It is an attack on all of us. It’s an attack on everything we hold dear.""Read more on the NYPD shooting here."

Kourtney Kardashian is quite the trendsetter when it comes to baby names. When she gave birth to her son Mason in 2009, the name was ranked at #34 on the list of most popular baby names for boys in the U.S. In 2013, according to Nameberry, Mason shot up to #4. Similarly, when daughter Penelope was born in 2012, it did not crack the top 100 most popular baby names for girls that year, but in 2013, Penelope came in at #56.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb775fc240000310057068f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this year, the on-field humiliation of the Washington football team was briefly overshadowed by increasingly vocal disapproval of the team name and Native American imagery associated with it, even among the team's faithful. But as the NFL season winds down and the organization counts the days until the misery finally comes to an end, the national debate over the franchise's embrace of an un-trademarkable, dictionary-defined racial slur appears to have faded. Groups like ""Change the Mascot"" and the National Congress of American Indians are working to keep the issue visible. The country can apparently only handle one news cycle each year focused on offensive Native American mascots, but billionaire team owner Daniel Snyder and the overwhelming -- though slowly shrinking -- majority of Americans who support the name are proof there's plenty of work left to do. Especially after a year that marked the public emergence of a misguided argument in favor of keeping the mascot.Many of the team's supporters have traditionally relied on ignorance or racism to argue that they shouldn't have to shoulder the inconvenience of changing, well, anything. This year, however, Snyder apparently realized that his organization's image problem was real, and that he needed a new strategy beyond simply telling Native Americans they were wrong to be offended. So he attempted to reinvent himself as a well-intentioned supporter of both his team's name and the people it offensively refers to, creating a foundation intended to help indigenous communities.""[Native Americans] have genuine issues they truly are worried about, and our team's name is not one of them,"" Snyder wrote in a letter announcing the program. This basic argument has been tossed around by the team's supporters -- and even among some Native Americans -- for years. And with the most vocal defender of the name now throwing money behind it, it was finally brought fully into the mainstream.A recent poll suggests Snyder is actually wrong about how Native Americans feel about the name. But more importantly, says Erik Stegman, associate director of the Half in Ten Education Fund at the Center for American Progress, Snyder fails to see the inseparable connection between the so-called ""genuine issues"" and his team's name.""If people that we're trying to convince on these policy issues still have the vision of the Washington Redskins or the Cleveland Indians or any of these others as their reference point for an actual group of people, that's a problem,"" Stegman told The Huffington Post. ""It impacts how [Native people] can advocate on all of these other very important issues.""This is particularly significant, because Snyder is right about one thing: Native Americans face many challenges beyond his team's name. Less than a century removed from some of the darkest chapters of U.S. policy on Native Americans, one in four Native people now lives in poverty. More than 16 percent of Native adults have diabetes, one of the highest rates among any ethnic group in the world. Native lands are regularly auctioned off by Congress in sweetheart deals for resource extraction. Native women are more than 2.5 times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than other women in the U.S. And drug and alcohol abuse run rampant in indigenous communities around the nation.And as Stegman says, making progress is difficult when most of the nation is only aware of Native Americans on game day, and even then, only as caricatures. To many people in American Indian country, no amount of Snyder's money can help address these problems so long as he says he will ""NEVER"" (in all caps) change a name that serves to perpetuate them. If Snyder genuinely cared about Native communities, opponents of the name argue, he would acknowledge the role his team plays in marginalizing them.Ray Halbritter, representative of the Oneida Indian Nation and an occasional Huffington Post blogger, says that instead, Snyder and other supporters of these names and mascots are denying Native Americans a simple request to be seen as equals in the eyes of their non-Native peers.""They're so desensitized, they think Indian people are not real people; our children and our concerns are not real to them,"" Halbritter told The Huffington Post. ""They don't think [the debate] is even real, they don't even think it's even worth bringing up or talking about. We're not human beings, we're not even part of humanity. And that's the problem. They think of us as just something to entertain them, or mascots -- relics out of a museum.""With only 5.2 million Native Americans in the U.S. -- 2 percent of the total population, according to the 2012 Census, with much of it concentrated on reservations in certain areas of the country -- these representations can be particularly hard to recalibrate. Halbritter says teams like Snyder's feed these misperceptions and allow the broader public to ignore the real power these words and images have on actual people.""Denigrating Native Americans as mascots dehumanizes them and it pretends that their challenges are simply not important, that their children are not as important as white children or any other race,"" he said. ""At the heart of the issues in Indian Country and virtually every organization of people in the world is what they think of themselves. ... It goes to the issue of our children and how they're affected and how their minds are shaped about how think about themselves.""The next generation of Native youth is regularly highlighted in the debate over offensive imagery, and its members have become increasingly visible as both primary stakeholders and leading activists. Earlier this year, Stegman published a report on the social and psychological impacts of these mascots and team names on Native youth. It concluded that the presence of organizations built on Native American stereotypes negatively affects the self-esteem and mental health of young Native Americans, who are already faced with inferior educational resources and a suicide rate 2.5 times higher than the national average.""School is a tough place, and when you're a young person having to deal with your identity, in this case as Native people, these representations really matter,"" Stegman said. ""They impact the way that you learn, they impact how you interact with your fellow classmates and they impact how you feel about your own culture and your own community.""People like Snyder often suggest that Native Americans tackle their most pressing challenges directly, rather than focus on a team name. But Native Americans have no intention of choosing between addressing the individual issues and combatting the broader environment of disrespect, ignorance and ostracization that contributes to them. Earlier this month, representatives from the nation's 566 federally recognized Native tribes gathered at the White House Tribal Nations Conference in Washington, D.C., to discuss the state of affairs in Indian country and outline a blueprint for moving forward.The backlash again Native mascots and team names may have gotten increasing attention for a few weeks this year and last, but Native Americans have been fighting these battles for decades. And few today are downplaying the formidable opponent they face in Snyder and his billion-dollar profit machine. Empathy is hard enough to come by as it is, and in this case, a small minority group is working to win over a sports-obsessed public that feels entitled to a team name and mascot that shouldn't be theirs to define. But both Stegman and Halbritter are optimistic that the debate is at least headed in the right direction. They see a growth in productive conversations about these damaging depictions of Native people, which have in turn produced some tangible victories. Earlier this month, the Oklahoma City School Board voted unanimously to change a local high school's ""Redskins"" mascot after impassioned testimony from a number of Native Americans.It's a small step forward, but Halbritter says if American principles hold true, it will be followed by much larger ones.""That's one of the fundamental values and principles of this country, that it finds its way to gravitate to doing what's the right thing,"" he said. ""And that's what this is about. It's trying to get the consciousness of America to line up with the principles of America so that the needle aligns to the pole of right and people just do the right thing."""

Mary Landrieu (D-LA) during the 'Women with Mary Geaux Vote' event at the Sugar Mill on November 1, 2014 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Landrieu is faced off against two Republicans for the senate seat, Rep. Bill Cassidy and retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e1852100004202c968ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a supporter of Hillary Clinton for president if she runs, I don't mind the efforts of some Democrats to urge Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to change her mind and run for president. I admire Warren, especially her recent effort to strip the ""cromnibus"" budget bill of a rollback of Dodd-Frank. On the other hand, she is now being described in the Senate by some Republicans as the ""Ted Cruz of the Democratic Party."" A major progressive Democratic House member who supported Barack Obama in 2008 expressed the same concern over the weekend on a liberal-oriented cable network. Unfair, and not good.The fact is, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren and most Democrats are more united on the basic issues than I can recall in a long time. They have all focused on the plight of the squeezed middle class and working families stuck in wage stagnation, their children burdened by substantial student loan debts while the income disparity between the super wealthy and the rest of America grows every year with no end in sight.Unfortunately, many in the media seem bent on creating bogus substantial differences among them, using empty labels as pejoratives, devoid of facts. For example, a recent Bloomberg news article recently reported that pro-Warren Democrats are concerned about Clinton's ""pro-business economic policies and a roster of Wall Street donors."" But what facts support these labels?Like Warren, Clinton supported the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As a U.S. senator, Clinton opposed extending tax cuts to those earning over $250,000 a year. She supports Obamacare, increasing the minimum wage and the president's strict regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the planetary threat of global warming. ""Pro business economic policies?""Of course, in her two successful campaigns for the U.S. Senate from New York, and in her 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton accepted donations from those who work on Wall Street. So did President Obama in 2008 as well as 2012. But what policies did either support, influenced by such donations? None are cited -- none exist.On foreign policy, former Secretary of State Clinton supported the moderate opposition to the brutal Syrian dictator, Bashar Assad -- the current policy of Obama. She supported Obama's policies backing the use of NATO air power (including French and British planes as well as U.S.) to assist the popular revolt against Libya's military dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. She supports Obama's limits on U.S. ground forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Does that justify the label of ""hawkish"" for her and Obama? Really?Of course, there are differences in style and approach. Like President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton believes in a lean and efficient government as a partner of the job creation engine of the private sector. And she has demonstrated over the years an ability to work with Republicans to get things done. Howard Dean recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. He wrote in Politico Magazine:Hillary Clinton is by far the most qualified person in the United States to serve as President. ... [S]he has a record in the Senate of successfully working with both sides of our very combative political spectrum in order to accomplish goals that improve the lives of ordinary Americans. Warren has repeatedly stated that she is not running for president in 2016. Perhaps that is because she sees no substantial policy differences that would motivate her to change her mind if fellow progressive Democrat Hillary Clinton becomes a candidate. And the senator understands that Clinton is now in the strongest position to become the nation's first woman president, leading every possible Republican presidential candidate in the polls, as well as on the four personal qualities that Americans most value in a president.But if for some reason Warren changes her mind and decides to run, vigorous competition and debates among fellow progressives on the best ideas to achieve similar goals will end up strengthening the ultimate Democratic Party nominee -- just as was the case for Barack Obama in 2008.That is why Democrats must resist the media's apparently unavoidable temptation to create excitement and -- may I suggest it? -- high ratings and lots of column inches by depicting bogus divisions among Democratic candidates. Supporters of the various candidates need to stick to the facts about their favored candidate and avoid empty, inaccurate labels in describing other Democratic candidates -- and insist that the media and the pundits do the same.Mr. Davis is a weekly columnist for The Hill newspaper, writing under the name, ""Purple Nation.""

The killing set off a wave of protests against the treatment of minority groups by police.On Friday about 100 pro-police demonstrators gathered on a sidewalk in lower Manhattan, separated from dozens of opposing protesters by a metal barricade. A contingent of uniformed officers cast a wary eye over the encounter. There was no violence.Jim and Kathleen Hall, 52 and 56, joined the rally to show support for their sons, one of whom is a New York police officer while the other is attending the Police Academy.""It's just a matter of respect,"" Kathleen Hall said. ""Every walk of life there's good and bad.""Mike Staples, 59, said he thought it was wrong for the police to be demonized.""""Being cast as all bad is completely incorrect,"" he said. ""I think it's important for everyone's voice to be heard.""Some protesters, their bodies pressed against the barricades, engaged in loud arguments with their counterparts.""Respect the badge, respect the law,"" shouted a pro-police demonstrator, eliciting an opposing protester to reply: ""It's easy to say when it's in your favor.""Protests proliferated earlier this month after two separate grand juries declined to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a chokehold, and Darren Wilson, an officer who killed an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.The protests, which have become less frequent in recent days, have forced Mayor Bill de Blasio to perform a delicate balancing act of reassuring the critics of police tactics who helped elect him last year without antagonizing the officers who work for him.Nevertheless, the mayor's relationship with the city's largest police union, has become increasingly hostile.Last week, Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, urged police officers to request that the mayor stay away from their funeral should they die in the line of duty, saying de Blasio had refused ""to show police officers the support and respect they deserve.""De Blasio called the move ""just plain divisive and unacceptable,"" and has repeatedly said in recent weeks that he will not tolerate attacks on police officers.Although the protests in Ferguson and on the West Coast have been marked by frequent outbursts of violence and property damage, the protests in New York City have generally been more restrained, although police say that two officers were assaulted by protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday.Police have arrested two suspects and are looking for four others, although they said they had a ""person of interest"" in custody on Friday.

A Rolling Stone article last week alleged a gang rape at the house which has since suspended operations. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c27e200000e80000dd30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK –- A Rolling Stone fact-checker didn't ask University of Virginia officials via email about an alleged 2012 gang rape described in an explosive and now unraveling article published last month. Under a Freedom of Information Act request, The Huffington Post obtained 104 pages of email correspondence between UVA officials and Rolling Stone contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely, who wrote the story, and assistant editor Elisabeth Garber-Paul, who fact-checked it. Much of the correspondence involves scheduling of interviews with university President Teresa Sullivan and other officials. But the emails also shed light on the magazine's fact-checking process, which has come into question amid discrepancies in the article. In early November, Garber-Paul asked university spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn several broad questions about how sexual assault complaints are handled by the school. Notably, she did not ask about the case involving Jackie, the UVA student whose story of a gang rape perpetrated by seven Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members served as the centerpiece of Erdely’s piece. It's possible Garber-Paul asked about Jackie's case by phone. But the absence of questions about Jackie or Phi Kappa Psi in the emailed fact-checking queries is surprising, given the seriousness of the allegations. Rolling Stone spokeswoman Melissa Bruno had no immediate comment on whether Garber-Paul asked questions about Jackie's case by phone.The Rolling Stone article, first published online Nov. 19, began unraveling following reports from The Washington Post, Slate, and others. Rolling Stone acknowledged discrepancies and issued an apology on Dec. 5, but still has not fully retracted the story. The magazine also has acknowledged that Erdely did not contact the alleged attackers for comment before publication because of an unusual agreement in which Jackie said she feared for her safety. Three friends of Jackie, who, in the story, discouraged her from reporting the crime, have since said publicly that Erdely never contacted them before publication and disputed her characterization of their behavior on the night in question. Erdely asked Sullivan about the alleged 2012 gang rape at Phi Kappa Psi involving Jackie, according to the article. But it remains unclear how Erdely went about corroborating Jackie's claims or how the magazine's fact-checker tried verifying details of the account.Erdely has not commented about the story for several weeks. Will Dana, managing editor of Rolling Stone, hasn’t spoken publicly on the story since Dec. 5. The magazine has made no editors available for interviews and has said Rolling Stone is conducting an internal review. There is a passing reference to Jackie in one email between Erdely and a UVA dean, but Jackie otherwise is unmentioned in the email cache. A separate sexual assault case from the spring does come up in the correspondence. On Oct. 9, de Bruyn told Erdely that her “characterization of the facts” regarding the spring 2014 case were “incorrect.” Citing federal privacy laws, de Bruyn told Erdely he couldn’t elaborate on what was wrong. That case comes up again on Nov. 13, when de Bruyn tells Garber-Paul that the university is concerned Erdely had mischaracterized the facts of the spring incident.“It has been brought to our attention by a few students that Sabrina has spoken to that she is referencing an incident where a male student raped three different women and received a one-year suspension,” de Bruyn wrote. “This is in fact objectively false.”The emails don't mention specific names, but Erdely did write about a spring 2014 incident involving a freshman whom she identified only as Stacy. In the Rolling Stone article, Stacy described how UVA officials tried discouraging her from reporting being raped to the school's Sexual Misconduct Board. Stacy told Erdely that the alleged rapist's wealthy family ""threatened to sue deans individually, they threatened to sue me."" She also learned of ""two other women with stories of assault by the same man,"" according to the article. Though the man was found guilty, he only received a one-year suspension, according to the article, which noted UVA officials wouldn't discuss the case due to privacy laws."

The last time I caught up with this artist's work, a couple of years ago, he was already painting, um... flowers -- a bold, provocative gesture, fraught with professional risk in a culture in which the mainstream could reliably be expected to sneer at such an enterprise. The paintings were beautiful, studied, quite formal in presentation -- and the last thing I would have expected from a contemporary artist at the peak of an already distinguished career.To judge by his current exhibition, ""Floral Paintings and Miniatures,"" Reiss has been working hard to extend the boundaries he himself had begun to establish in those early floral paintings. These new, large-scale works are painted with the same meticulous attention to detail and the same exemplary skill. Formally, they create the illusion of symmetry without being exactly symmetrical... Sunflowers After Dark, 2013, oil and acrylic on canvas, 68 x 52 inches (all images courtesy of the artist and Diane Rosenstein)Formally, too, they work as exhaustive exercises in the delicate art of color composition. Lilies, sunflowers, birds-of-paradise, roses, these floral images float against flat, monochrome backgrounds enhanced with cut-outs and stencils that contrast their natural beauty, with quiet irony, with cultural icons of the contemporary world: the silhouettes of cityscapes, for example, or images that seem to reference the familiar excesses of the art market. In a nod to Manet -- and perhaps, to this viewer, to the meditative serenity of Buddhist practice -- one quartet of paintings depicts the lovely form of lotus blossoms and the outline of lily pads, seen directly from above; and beneath, or perhaps more accurately behind them, as though in the water of a pond, lurk the barely discernable forms of variegated koi fish. Lilies in Blue, 2014, oil and acrylic on canvas, 44 x 44 inchesAs I perused the surface of these paintings, I was struck quite unexpectedly by their aesthetic continuity with the other components of this exhibition: a handful of the exquisitely constructed miniature dioramas that brought the artist considerable renown some decades earlier. F/X: In Search of Truth, 1990, mixed media, 14 x 24 x 24 inchesWrought with the same passionate dedication to detail and the same exacting craftsmanship, these three-dimensional mini-dramas required (and continue to require, in the examples included here) the same kind of exploratory looking: the two-dimensional surface of the paintings offers the same kind of visual complexity and invites the same kind of pleasurable detective work as the dioramas. The viewer's eye and mind are drawn into an act of (act-ive) contemplation, moving through surfaces and between objects in a constant voyage of discovery. When I used, above, the word ""delight,"" I intended it as an accurate description of the actual physical sensation that this artist's work arouses. As viewers, we feel constantly invited in, in a way that makes the work, beyond its intellectual engagement, a rare experience of sheer, genuine pleasure. If the paintings glow with their own peculiar serenity, we find ourselves irresistibly glowing with them. In today's troubled world, such a gift is not to be taken lightly."
