0,POLITICS,Obama To Announce New Climate Change Help For Island Nations,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-climate-change_us_57c855dee4b0e60d31dda9bd,The announcement signals a changing tone on the need to deal with climate impacts already underway.,2016-09-01,"President Barack Obama disembarks from Air Force One in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Wednesday. He'll head to the remote Midway Atoll on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c85648160000ef1bc00017.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama on Thursday will announce $40 million in programs to help island nations and other communities vulnerable to climate change.Obama addressed the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the World Conservation Congress in Honolulu on Wednesday night. On Thursday, he is speaking from the remote coral reef Midway Atoll, where he will announce programs to both help nations react to climate-related changes and relocate people when it becomes necessary.After the Midway visit, Obama is heading to China to attend the G20 summit this weekend ― where he and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to formally join the climate agreement reached in Paris last year. The Pacific announcement on Thursday “shows the administration’s ongoing commitment to not only working with the large emitters ― the world’s largest, in the case of China ― but also importance of working with some of the smallest and most vulnerable in the world,” a White House official, speaking on background ahead of the announcements, told The Huffington Post.The new programs include a new USAID Climate Ready Program, which will direct $9 million toward helping governments develop policies that “promote resilience, enhance access to climate finance, and improve national capacity to manage and monitor adaptation programs.” Those countries include Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.The U.S. also said it would direct up to $5 million to Pacific regional organizations through the Institutional Strengthening in Pacific Island Countries to Adapt to Climate Change (ISACC) program, and $15 million toward disaster-risk reduction initiatives in the region.The White House’s Council on Environmental Quality will also co-host a “Symposium on Climate Displacement, Migration, and Relocation” in December 2016 in Hawaii. The White House official said the efforts signal that the Obama administration is prioritizing helping countries adapt to climate shifts already underway, rather than just focusing on efforts to cut emissions driving the problem. “These announcements are a sign that we are not only not shying away from that conversation, but we’re actively embracing it,” said the official. The official said that the symposium discussion will also focus on climate relocation and adaptation needs in the U.S., where Alaskan native villages and coastal Louisiana communities are already working on relocation due to erosion and sea level rise. “We will be talking about our issues as well,” he said.“I think there’s both a realization of what’s happening, and the pace at which climate change is forcing these conversations. That grows every year, and every month as we see the impact of climate change,” said the official. “I think the goal that we set out last year in Paris to attempt to limit climate change to well less than 2 degrees in terms of temperatures rises ― even in that world there will be major relocations and dislocations.”The announcement “builds on the deep partnership that President Obama forged with island leaders when they worked together on the historic Paris agreement last year,” said Brian Deese, senior adviser to the president, in a statement. “As the President told Pacific Island leaders last night, their leadership was a key part of reaching a global climate agreement, and our partnership going forward will be a key part of winning the fight against climate change.”"
1,POLITICS,Virginia Republicans Seem Determined To Not Let Thousands Of Ex-Felons Vote In November,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-terry-mcauliffe-felons-vote_us_57c81f9be4b0a22de0941e95,They're asking the state Supreme Court to hold Gov. Terry McAuliffe in contempt.,2016-09-01,Did Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) violate the state constitution with his latest attempt to re-enfranchise those who have paid their debts to society? Virginia Republicans think so.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c822cc170000172ac76efa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What the governor giveth, the state Supreme Court taketh away. And so the governor giveth again ― but maybe not for long.Republican lawmakers in Virginia are asking the state’s high court to hold Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) in contempt for not adhering to an earlier ruling that declared his attempt to restore voting rights to 200,000 ex-felons unconstitutional.After the Virginia Supreme Court, on a 4-to-3 vote, said in July that McAuliffe’s order went beyond his clemency powers under the state’s constitution, the governor gave it a second shot in late August ― this time individually issuing restoration orders for 13,000 people who had their voting registrations canceled by the court.“I am not content to condemn them for eternity as inferior and second-class citizens,” he said of those men and women affected, all of whom had completed their sentences and had reregistered to vote following McAuliffe’s earlier decree.Now Virginia Republicans want these individual orders held invalid, too, arguing Wednesday that the governor’s move is merely a political power play and an affront to the Virginia Supreme Court.“In announcing last week his new plan to unilaterally re-enfranchise 206,000 felons, Governor McAuliffe again expressed his disdain for this Court’s decision,” read the lawmakers’ filing with the court.Lawyers for the GOP legislators told the court that “the purpose, scope, and effect of his new process is precisely the same” as the one McAuliffe employed in April, and that it’s equally unlawful because none of the former offenders who received the benefit had requested that their civil rights be restored.McAuliffe dismissed the Virginia GOP’s move and said he had “established a process that is fully consistent with the ruling as well as the precedent of past governors.”“Our ongoing fight to restore Virginians’ rights is about one thing: Moving our Commonwealth into the mainstream of American states where people who serve their time reenter society as full citizens again,” he said in a statement Wednesday.McAuliffe added that the GOP’s legal effort is simply designed to “intimidate and disenfranchise” voters who might otherwise turn the tide against the Republican Party’s presidential nominee.“The people who have filed it are more concerned with the impact new voters could have on Donald Trump’s campaign than they are with the dignity of the people whom they continue to drag through the mud with their political lawsuits and ugly attacks,” the governor said.John Whitbeck, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, called McAuliffe’s new wave of orders a “mail merge” operation to try and get Hillary Clinton ― a close friend whose presidential campaign McAuliffe ran in 2008 ― elected.He also said he and his party had hoped McAuliffe “would see the error of his ways” and do as the state’s high court had instructed. “Sadly, we were wrong,” Whitbeck said in a statement.In April, The Atlantic chronicled the racist origins of Virginia’s felon disenfranchisement laws.Clarification: Language has been updated to indicate that Republican lawmakers, not the state party, are bringing the contempt action against McAuliffe."
2,POLITICS,Donald Trump Had A Bizarre And Abysmal August,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-august_us_57c737b2e4b078581f10e063,"He trailed in the polls, had a major staff overhaul and tried to seize on a tragedy for his own advantage.",2016-09-01,Paul Manafort resigned as chair of the Trump campaign in August.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c73ee51600002900bffca6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico capped off a chaotic month for the Republican nominee, in which he feuded with the family of a killed U.S. soldier, had abysmal poll numbers and saw his campaign chair resign under suspicion of working on behalf of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.After making the deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants the foundation of his presidential campaign, Trump seemed to have a different message each day last week. First, he suggested that he was open to “softening” his position, leading to speculation that he might consider allowing some undocumented immigrants to stay in the country. Later in the week, he reiterated his original hardline stance ― that undocumented immigrants would have to leave the country, then return, in order to have a path to citizenship. On Saturday he continued in that vein, promising to begin deportations within an hour of taking office.Trump’s bad August got its start in the waning days of July, when he lashed out against Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of a U.S. soldier who was killed in Iraq in 2004. With his wife at his side, Khizr Khan gave a moving speech at the Democratic National Convention asking what Trump had sacrificed for his country. Trump responded by suggesting that Ghazala Khan “maybe... wasn’t allowed” to speak that night because of her Muslim faith. Khan herself then explained that she didn’t speak because she is still moved to tears just by seeing a picture of her son.The Republican standard-bearer then turned his sights on his own party, refusing to endorse the re-election bids of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.). Trump gave in just three days later and endorsed all three.Trump, who has made sexist and misogynistic comments throughout his campaign (and for years before that), said he would expect his daughter Ivanka to quit her job if she were sexually harassed. In a separate interview, Trump’s son Eric said that Ivanka simply wouldn’t allow herself to be subjected to sexual harassment.Later in the month, it was revealed that Trump was being advised by former Fox News head Roger Ailes, who resigned from Fox in July amid numerous allegations of sexual harassment. Trump used August to try and launch a series of bizarre attacks against Hillary Clinton, at one point apparently suggesting that the Democratic nominee should be shot.“If she gets to pick her judges ― nothing you can do, folks,” Trump said at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina. “Although, the Second Amendment people. Maybe there is. I don’t know.” Trump also claimed he was unfamiliar with comments in which one of his advisers called for Clinton to be shot for treason, but called the adviser “a very fine person” nonetheless.The month continued to get worse. Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman, resigned on Aug. 19 amid questions about his work on behalf of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine. The New York Times reported on Aug. 14 that Manafort’s name appeared in a secret government ledger in Ukraine. The Associated Press soon followed with reports detailing how Manafort’s firm had orchestrated a lobbying campaign on behalf of Ukraine, but failed to disclose the work to the Justice Department as required by federal law.After Manafort’s resignation, Trump tapped Kellyanne Conway to be his campaign manager and hired Steve Bannon, the chairman of Breitbart News, as his campaign chairman. Reports soon emerged that Bannon had been charged with domestic violence in 1996 and that he was registered to vote at an empty house in Florida. Meanwhile, Trump’s poll numbers dropped as he fell behind Clinton in virtually every survey. Adding to the embarrassment was Michael Cohen, executive vice president at the Trump Organization, who seemed to be in denial about the campaign’s numbers in an exchange with CNN’s Brianna Keilar. When Cohen asked repeatedly which polls showed Trump down, Keilar simply said “all of them.” She was correct.Trump and his campaign also began to question Clinton’s health, peddling unsubstantiated rumors that she was medically unfit to be president. The attack wound up backfiring, leading to increased scrutiny on irregularities in a letter that Trump’s doctor, Harold Bornstein, had sent attesting to his health. Bornstein admitted that he wrote the letter in five minutes while a car was waiting for him.Various surrogates for Trump, charged with defending and promoting their candidate, also had some noteworthy flubs. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, insisted that Manafort’s departure did not signal turmoil for the Trump campaign because John Kerry also shook up his staff at about the same point in the 2004 presidential election cycle. (Kerry, you’ll recall, went on to lose that election.) As Trump publicly pushed Clinton to release more of her medical records, Ben Carson said that Trump should release his. And as Trump tried to appeal to African-American voters, Mark Burns, a pastor and Trump surrogate, tweeted an image of Clinton in blackface and captioned it: “Black Americans, THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOTES and letting me use you again..See you again in 4 years.” In an ostensible effort to attract black voters, Trump painted an inaccurate picture of American cities, claiming that life in black communities has gotten so bad that African-Americans would have nothing to lose by voting for him. After Nykea Aldridge, the cousin of NBA player Dwyane Wade, was killed in Chicago, Trump took advantage of the tragedy, tweeting that it was “just what I have been saying” and declaring that “African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!”And because he couldn’t seem to find enough people to insult, Trump also went after a fire marshal at one of his rallies and a mother whose baby was crying.As The Washington Post’s Dan Balz noted, Trump’s actions took away attention from Clinton at a time when questions continued to linger about her use of a private email server and about whether donors to the Clinton Foundation got preferential treatment when she was secretary of state.Though it’s easy to assume that Trump’s bad August will hurt him in November, the GOP nominee has said that he could stand in the middle of Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue and shoot people without losing votes. One hopes it doesn’t come to that.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Instead, it will choose from a selection of names for the young gorilla and then allow the public to vote between the preselected options.For now, zoo representatives can’t say one way or the other whether they’re considering putting “Harambe” in the running.“I know everyone wants some kind of answers right now, but we’re not there,” Amy Shearer, the zoo’s chief marketing officer, told The Huffington Post. “Right now we need to be focusing on this beautiful baby and this beautiful birth.”She added that the zoo doesn’t even know whether the little gorilla is a male or a female, since the mother has been keeping close guard of her offspring ― which Shearer says is a good thing.“She is being a tremendous mom and she’s keeping that baby close,” she said.All that said, we fear for the zoo’s social media team if they don’t ultimately choose “Harambe” as an option.If the zoo does ignore the clear popular choice, they’ll be following the lead of the U.K. government, which refused to name a research vessel “Boaty McBoatface” after the moniker was a runaway winner in a public vote.Instead, we urge the zoo to follow the example of Greenpeace, which agreed to name a humpback whale “Mr. Splashy Pants,” just like the people wanted."

7,POLITICS,House Republicans Will Investigate Their Ability To Investigate Investigations,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-science-exxon_us_57c885e8e4b0a22de095027f,All in the interest of protecting ExxonMobil from state probes.,2016-09-01,Rep. Lamar Smith has demonstrated little interest in understanding climate science.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Science Committee Chair Lamar Smith (R-Texas) wants to exert congressional authority over state attorneys general who are trying to investigate ExxonMobil’s climate record.The committee announced plans to hold an oversight hearing on Sept. 14 to “examine Congress’ investigative authority as it relates to the committee’s oversight of the impact of investigations undertaken by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts at the behest of several environmental organizations.” The hearing will feature three conservative legal scholars, according to The Hill.The hearing title, “Affirming Congress’ Constitutional Oversight Responsibilities: Subpoena Authority and Recourse for Failure to Comply with Lawfully Issued Subpoenas,” is a mouthful. But it basically seeks to lend credence to the committee’s efforts to investigate the state attorneys general who are investigating ExxonMobil. The attorneys general from New York, California, Massachusetts and the Virgin Islands announced investigations into Exxon following stories in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times reporting that Exxon’s scientists knew about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, even as the company worked to undermine climate science. Exxon has denied those reports and dismissed the investigations as “politically motivated.” The company tried to fight a subpoena from the Virgin Islands AG, arguing that it violates their First Amendment rights and “discriminates based on viewpoint to target one side of an ongoing policy debate”; the AG eventually withdrew the subpoena.Several other AGs have also said they will undertake investigations and enforcement actions against climate change deniers in the fossil fuel industry.Smith, who has demonstrated little interest in understanding climate science, has been using the committee to investigate those investigations, issuing his own subpoenas in July to “protect the American people from further infringement of their free speech rights.” He has called the AGs’ investigations “a form of extortion.”A spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has dismissed the investigation as “a small group of radical Republican House members” who are “trying to block a serious law enforcement investigation into potential fraud at Exxon.”"

Even if Democrats’ evolution on Social Security fails to win them control of the Senate, it is all but certain to achieve another progressive priority: ruling out a bipartisan budget deal to cut the program in the next Congress.The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an online liberal group, solicited original statements from the candidates about why they back Social Security expansion and publicized them in a press release on Thursday.The candidates’ statements, with rare exception, mark the first time they are on the record backing Social Security expansion, according to PCCC.“Years of progressive activism led to this moment,” PCCC co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a statement touting the news. “With Hillary Clinton and Senate candidates campaigning on the expansion of Social Security benefits to keep up with the rising costs faced by our seniors, it’s clear that the center of gravity has shifted in the Democratic Party in a more populist direction.”Some of the Democratic candidates campaigning on Social Security expansion ― like Judge and Kirkpatrick ― still face long odds in their battles to unseat Republican incumbents. Others in the cohort ― such as Harris and Bennet ― appear almost guaranteed to win.But for candidates like Ross in North Carolina, who is trailing Burr by just 2 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster, an issue like Social Security could make a difference. And victories in just a handful of Senate contests could restore Democrats’ control of the upper chamber. As of late August, Democrats had a 55 percent chance of retaking the Senate come November, according to a HuffPost Pollster analysis. It is not hard to see why Democrats are at least partly pinning their hopes on Social Security. Unlike means-tested social programs often derided as handouts to undeserving people, Social Security enjoys strong support among Republicans as well as Democrats. More than two-thirds of Republicans at least oppose cutting Social Security’s benefits, according to a Pew poll released in March.Until recently, however, Democrats were more concerned that opposing Social Security cuts would make them seem like they were soft on debt. For many years, President Barack Obama doggedly sought a so-called Grand Bargain with Republicans that would have cut Social Security in exchange for revenue hikes. But an improving economy, which reduced deficits, and persistent progressive activism that framed Social Security benefits as inadequate for an impending retirement income crisis, led to a tidal change in the party’s view of the program. Social Security will not be able to pay out all of its promised benefits by 2034 if nothing is done to address its long-term funding gap. Progressives support closing the gap through revenue increases, which they argue can also finance some benefit increases. Conservatives favor closing the funding gap primarily through gradual benefit cuts.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton promised not to cut Social Security in February, saying instead that she supports expanding it. (Obama followed suit, embracing benefits expansion in a June speech.)Republican standard-bearer Donald Trump has said he would not to cut the program."
11,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Raised A Massive $143 Million In August,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-august-fundraising_us_57c88cece4b0a22de09515d9,It was the Democratic presidential nominee's best month to date.,2016-09-01,Hillary Clinton raised $143 million for her campaign and the Democratic Party in August.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c88dc0170000172ac77119.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton raised $143 million for her presidential campaign and the Democratic Party in August, according to a release from the campaign.The fundraising haul came from the combined efforts of Clinton’s official campaign committee and two joint fundraising committees, Hillary Victory Fund and Hillary Action Fund. The latter two raise money for the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party committees. The Clinton campaign took in $62 million while $81 million was directed to the Democratic National Committee and various state parties.According to the campaign, the three Clinton committees started September with $152 million cash on hand. This includes $68 million for the official Clinton campaign committee and $84 million parked in the two joint fundraising committees.“Thanks to the 2.3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.The overall total is quite a bit more than the $110 million raised by President Barack Obama in August 2012 for his re-election campaign and the joint fundraising committee linked to various Democratic Party committees. Clinton has the advantage of a more favorable legal environment for fundraising. In 2014, the Supreme Court eliminated aggregate campaign contribution limits in its McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission ruling. This allowed donors to make maximum donations to as many candidates, party committees and political action committees as they desired. The key impact for Clinton has been a joint fundraising committee ― Hillary Victory Fund ― connected to the Democratic National Committee and 32 state parties. Obama’s joint fundraising committee was connected to six state parties and the DNC. It could not direct more than $70,800 to them from a single donor. With donations capped at $10,000 for each state party and $30,800 for the DNC, that meant donors could not fully max out to all six state parties. Now they can make that $10,000 donation to all 32 of the state committees linked to Clinton’s joint fundraising committee.Additionally, Congress slipped an expansion of party contribution limits into the 2014 omnibus budget bill that passed in the post-election lame duck session. This change created three new party accounts at the DNC that could accept a maximum annual donation of $100,200 per donor. This has meant that a maximum contribution to the DNC via the Hillary Victory Fund could be $334,000.The campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has not yet announced its fundraising haul for August."

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it is running out of funds to fight the virus.The current Zika outbreak, first detected in Brazil last year, has rapidly spread across the Americas.Florida officials said more than 40,000 mosquitoes had been tested since May, and that the three samples were the first to test positive.“It means that there is a substantial amount of Zika virus in that population because it’s actually not easy to find the virus in the mosquitoes that you trap,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.Zika infection in pregnant women can cause the rare birth defect known as microcephaly, which can lead to serious developmental problems, and has also been linked to severe fetal brain abnormalities.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Frances Kerry)"

In Brazil, Zika has been linked to more than 1,800 cases of microcephaly.The first alarms over Zika in Brazil, however, occurred months before microcephaly cases emerged, as adults recovering from Zika infections appeared to have higher-than-normal rates of Guillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks itself in the aftermath of an infection, typically occurring in the days following an illness.In a report published as a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of the department of communicable disease at PAHO - the regional arm of the World Health Organization - and colleagues analyzed rates of Guillain-Barre syndrome and Zika in Bahia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname and Venezuela.They evaluated a total of 164,237 confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease and 1,474 cases of Guillain-Barre that occurred between April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, using data collected through official country reports.Their analysis found a close association between increases in Zika cases and increases in Guillain-Barre. As Zika infections waned in a country, incidence of Guillain-Barre waned as well, the team found.Compared with pre-Zika rates, Guillain-Barre increased 172 percent in the state of Bahia, Brazil, which was hard hit by the Zika outbreak. They saw similar increases in other countries, with Guillain-Barre cases rising 211 percent in Colombia, 150 percent in the Dominican Republic, 100 percent in El Salvador, 144 percent in Honduras, 400 percent in Suriname and 877 percent in Venezuela.The team found no link between Guillain-Barre and dengue, a closely related virus that had been suspected as a contributor to the increase in cases.Based on their findings, the researchers said Zika and Guillain-Barre “are strongly associated,” however, they said more study is needed to prove direct causation.Guillain-Barre causes gradual weakness in the legs, arms and upper body, and in some cases, temporary paralysis. Patients often require intensive care and a respirator to support breathing.Given these demands, the researchers said Zika imposes “a substantial burden” on populations in Latin America and the Caribbean, where some 500 million people are at risk.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Bernard Orr)"

The two men met privately on Wednesday, and their stories about the interaction differed.Trump told reporters at a press conference that they “did not discuss payment of the wall” he has promised to build if he wins the general election. But Peña Nieto’s spokesman said later that the president began the meeting by saying Mexico would not pay for the wall.Peña Nieto said so again Wednesday evening. “At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico would not pay for the wall,” he tweeted in Spanish.He also said in an op-ed for El Universal on Thursday that he told Trump he was offended by the things the candidate has said about Mexicans, and that his country would not pay for a wall. Trump wasn’t having it. While delivering a speech in Phoenix Wednesday night, Trump called the Mexican president “a man I like and respect very much” but dismissed his words about a wall. “Mexico will pay for the wall, 100 percent,” Trump said during his speech. “They don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay for the wall.”He said the structure would be “an impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall” with technology to keep people from digging tunnels or going over it. “Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it,” he said. “And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I’m sure they will.”He stuck to that message early Thursday, prompting the latest Twitter response from Peña Nieto that afternoon.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the order of the tweets from Peña Nieto and Trump.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Legal progress has not eliminated acts of violence against members of the LGBT community, however, and transgender women have suffered the most in recent years. A report co-published by New York’s Cornell University Law School and California-based civil rights organization, the Transgender Law Center in May 2016 shows that Mexico has one of the world’s highest rates of transphobic violence — including harassment, hate crimes and murder.

Born in Bogota, Colombia, as Mauricio, she remembers beings a shy boy that everyone would pick on. “Sometimes I tease people and say, ‘If you felt fat in high school, well, I was a boy!’” she tells HuffPost Mexico.  The 34-year-old started to transition six years ago, facing a number of challenges along the way. “I had to deal with a teenager’s dilemmas when I was 28,” she says. Back then, she had already completed a Master’s degree and was running two digital media companies, one of which was her own. She wasn’t as concerned with her career ― which she managed to maintain as she settled into her new gender identity ― as she was with her social life, which suffered when she came out. “Many people turned away from me because of silly little things,” she explains, recalling how her relatives, friends and co-workers reacted when they saw her in high heels and a skirt instead of a suit and tie.  Pastrana believes that society’s aversion to transgender women can be explained by widespread misogyny and “hatred of everything feminine.” But while some transgender activists work to shed light on the suffering endured by transgender women, Pastrana’s activism focuses on helping members of the community embrace their bodies and work on achieving self-love.In addition to her digital activism on various platforms, Pastrana has opened up her house in the south of Mexico City to host transgender people. She has become an informal counselor and spokeswoman for the LGBT community, offering valuable advice for trans women battling societal prejudice and intolerance. “You have to work on your self-esteem,” she says. “Let them say whatever you want! They tell me, ‘You look like a man.’ Well, it doesn’t matter to me if you think so!” Pastrana is unnerved by society’s prevailing beauty standards, she explains, since they make transgender women believe that they need to “try a little harder” to be pretty. “Many transgender people live frustrated because they are not pretty. I know some who started transitioning, ended up not being the beautiful women they had imagined, and then de-transitioned,” she says. Pastrana is intent on pushing transgender women to achieve their full potential, and tries to alert them to any self-imposed limitations. “Whenever a person says, ‘If I come out, they’ll fire me,’ they are self-discriminating,” Pastrana says. “I tell them, ‘You have not been fired. The only person who has fired you is in your own head.’”Pastrana admits that she hasn’t always found it easy to be confident, but she continues to figure out ways to push herself. “This is going to sound very Michael Jackson of me, but to deal with self-empowerment,” she says, “I ultimately had to look myself in the mirror and say, ‘I’m gonna make a change.’” "

To read this article in Spanish from HuffPost Mexico, click here.Hundreds of thousands of disenchanted Venezuelans are marching in the capital, Caracas, Thursday, as part of a campaign by the opposition to push the national electoral council to speedily hold a referendum so that citizens can decide if they want President Nicolás Maduro to stay in power.The mass rally comes at a time when Venezuelans are desperate for change in their country — which is currently experiencing its worst economic depression in more than 200 years, soaring crime rates and a shortage of basic goods.“There’s been a collapse in Venezuela, an economic, social and political crisis,” Lilian Tintori, a Venezuelan human rights activist and the wife of Leopoldo López, a hardline opposition leader put behind bars in 2015 for “inciting violence” during protests, told HuffPost Mexico.“And the worst of it is that there is no medicine or food,” Tintori said in a phone conversation from the city of Barinas, where she was mobilizing for the peaceful march to Caracas.Together with other Venezuelan activists, Tintori has been demanding the recall referendum since March, but the national electoral council has repeatedly put it off. Stalling the process is in the ruling party’s best interest — if the vote is delayed until January, even if Maduro is toppled his vice president, a Socialist party member, would retain the right to serve out his term, which ends in 2019. An earlier referendum date — the scenario the opposition is hoping for — would bring about fresh elections. Polls indicate that an overwhelming majority of citizens would opt to vote Maduro out of power.“We want a change of government and a change of system. We want new people, leaders who are respected by Venezuelans, and, most importantly, who are democratic,” Tintori said. The current protests calling for “la salida” or the exit of Maduro have been preceded by waves of dissent criticizing the regime’s failure to address corruption, security challenges and economic struggles.Maduro’s popularity has continued to plummet as citizens stand in mile-long lines to access nearly empty supermarkets, endure power outages and struggle to make ends meet. “To feed a family of four, you need 16 minimum wages,” Tintori explained.In addition to her work defending López and other political prisoners, Tintori has also called on the government to open a humanitarian channel that would allow international aid, including medical supplies, to reach those in need. Her efforts have fallen on deaf ears, however. “Nicolas Maduro’s government doesn’t want to open a humanitarian channel because it still does not acknowledge that there is a crisis,” she said. Refusing to declare a state of emergency means that supplies from international aid organizations can’t enter the country.Thursday’s mass protest aims to make a public show of the people’s anger. In a recent interview with Venezuelan radio station RCM, manager of polling firm DatinCorp Jesus Seguías estimated that 34 percent of Caracas’ residents — 1,258,000 people — would attend the march. Members of indigenous tribes from the Amazonian state have also made their way to the capital to show their discontent and demand Maduro’s ouster.The government’s history of putting down mass protests has made it difficult for the opposition to mobilize the public in recent years. In 2014, protests called for by hardline opposition leaders López, Antonio Ledezma and Maria Corina Machado were met with police retaliation, leaving 43 dead.López is currently serving a 14-year sentence for his role in organizing and taking part in the deadly protests. Tintori says he is staying strong, despite enduring physical and psychological abuse.“Leopoldo is resisting; he is holding on,” Tintori said. “He tells me, ‘Lilian, they can put me in a shoebox, but I will not bow down and I will not compromise on my freedom, because my freedom is Venezuela’s freedom.’”Since his imprisonment, Tintori has met with international figures, including Vice President Joseph Biden, Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, to ask for their support for the release of her husband and other political prisoners.Amnesty International has deemed López a “prisoner of conscience,” and has called for his immediate release. “Leopoldo López is the victim of a vicious ‘witch hunt’ against anyone who dares to disagree with the Venezuelan government,” Carolina Jiménez, Americas deputy director for research at Amnesty International said earlier this month.“It’s been difficult,” said Tintori, who has two children. “I have to stand up for my Leopoldo and others, and tell the world what is happening in Venezuela.”“There are thousands of Venezuelan families separated by exile and displacement who are fleeing from the lack of security, the government and the theft of their lands or companies,” she added. “Every day, I try to find comfort in the thought that all these families, my own included, will meet very soon.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c898dc160000ef1bc00183.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Canada has officially launched a national inquiry into its sobering epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women, or MMIW― a move many hope will shed light on an issue shrouded in decades of confusion and political inaction.Echoed by activists nationwide, indigenous families’ repeated pleas for a formal investigation into the violent deaths and disappearances of female loved ones seem to have fallen on deaf ears over the years, despite troubling statistics highlighting the urgency of the crisis. Sixteen percent of Canada’s female homicide victims in recent decades were indigenous, even though their demographic, which is “disproportionately affected by all forms of violence,” comprises only 4 percent of the nation’s female population, the government notes on its website.Canada’s national and federal police force, the RCMP, released a shocking report in 2014 concluding that indigenous women in the country were nearly seven times more likely to be murdered than non-indigenous women.The findings also revealed that between 1980 and 2013, 1,181 indigenous women in Canada went missing or had been murdered. Of those cases, 225 remain unsolved with the cause of disappearance or death listed simply as “unknown” or “foul play suspected.”These figures have been widely disputed, with several women’s rights advocacy groups like Native Women’s Association of Canada asserting there are actually thousands more Canadian indigenous women who are missing or slain.The NWAC acquired research that suggests the RCMP failed to document almost 3,000 additional MMIW cases in its report, Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett pointed out in February.While in office, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper repeatedly denied public requests for an official MMIW inquiry, saying “we are way past the time for further study.” His Conservative government’s “failure” to adequately address the crisis yielded harsh backlash from critics, including the United Nations Human Rights Committee.Harper’s successor, Justin Trudeau, vowed during his election campaign to prioritize the issue.Almost one year after Trudeau’s election in October 2015, his promised MMIW inquiry is underway, although the federal government is not directly involved at this stage. A panel of appointed independent commissioners will conduct a nearly $54 million investigation before presenting their final recommendations to the government by the end of 2018.The commissioners’ approach will include reviewing existing literature on the issue, and listening to affected indigenous families and survivors of violence in a way that is “trauma-informed and culturally-appropriate.” Their ultimate objective is to analyze the root causes behind the MMIW epidemic by “looking for patterns and underlying factors that explain why higher levels of violence occur.”The inquiry began Thursday, but Chief Commissioner Marion Buller, British Columbia’s first female indigenous judge, told Canadians not to expect major results in the near future due to the intimate nature of the process. Information about the committee and its work is limited currently, but it will establish its own office and website at some point.In addition to the independent inquiry, the Canadian Department of Justice is allocating $16.17 million over four years for new Family Information Liaison Units in each province and territory to provide resources and support to those affected by the MMIW crisis.

The region ― which includes the dozens of African countries located south of the Sahara desert ― currently accounts for about half of children living in extreme poverty worldwide. The World Bank classifies people as being in extreme poverty if they live on less than $1.90 a day. The region’s poor have further to go than others when it comes to “crossing” above the extreme poverty line. Sub-Saharan Africa also faces high levels of inequality and is in a much earlier stage of demographic transition than other areas ― meaning it still experiences high birth and death rates ― according to the report.The region has succeeded in significantly reducing its child mortality rate, yet fertility rates remain high by international standards. Though reducing extreme poverty will require a multi-pronged approach, increasing access to family planning is a critical element, per the report.Women in the region have an average of 4.7 children. That’s twice the number in South Asia, for example. One-quarter of women of reproductive age in the area say they have unmet needs for family planning. Family planning addresses a number of issues. For one, those programs can help to free up government resources.Every dollar spent on family planning can save governments up to $6, which can be spent on improving health, housing, water and other public services, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which works to bring contraception to women and girls in need. Getting contraception into the hands of adolescents is particularly crucial, since delaying pregnancy increases their chances of pursuing education and economic opportunities.But part of the issue on that front is figuring out how to effectively address child marriage.About 12 percent of girls in sub-Saharan Africa marry before they turn 15, and 40 percent wed before 18. Four countries in the region have the highest child marriage rates worldwide. In India, by contrast, which has the 10th highest child marriage rate in the world, 47 percent of girls are married before they turn 18, according to Girls Not Brides, a nonprofit that works to end child marriage. One way to combat child marriage and teen pregnancy is to incentivize girls to stay in school. Providing cash transfers for those who continue to pursue their education has been proven to help reduce the social and economic pressures surrounding child marriage, the report recommends. Still, even when contraception is made available, and women and girls know where to access it, they still often avoid it because of the stigma associated with the issue.“Women in the developing world will tell you they cannot use condoms,” Melinda Gates told The New York Times in 2013. “They can’t negotiate a condom even in their marriage because they’re either suggesting their husband has AIDS or that they do.”The Gates Foundation is one of a number of groups working to dispel those stereotypes, address other related issues among the world’s poorest and identify implementable solutions. By 2020, the organization has committed to bringing high-quality contraceptive information, service and supplies to an additional 120 million women and girls in the most underserved countries. "

In both countries, 59 percent of children are out of school.Last month UNICEF said a spike in the forced recruitment of child soldiers in South Sudan could be imminent amid fears the East Africa nation was on the brink of renewed civil war.Although school is vital for children living in crises, education is one of the least funded sectors in humanitarian appeals, the U.N. children’s fund, UNICEF, said in a statement.“For countries affected by conflict, school equips children with the knowledge and skills they need to rebuild their communities once the crisis is over,” UNICEF’s chief of education Jo Bourne said in the statement.“Schools can also protect children from the trauma and physical dangers around them.”Classroom routines can help children psychologically after witnessing atrocities, as well as safeguarding them from abuse, experts say.A crisis fund was launched in May at the World Humanitarian Summit to increase funding for children missing out on school due to war and natural disasters.The West African country of Liberia, which emerged from two civil wars in 2003, temporarily shut its schools to stop the spread of the Ebola epidemic, which ended in June.The 18 million children in the 10 worst countries for access to primary school account for almost one third of the world’s 61 million primary school-aged children who are out of school, UNICEF said.Here are the top 10 countries in the world with the highest proportion of children missing out on primary school:1) Liberia - 62 percent2) South Sudan - 59 percent3) Eritrea - 59 percent4) Afghanistan - 46 percent5) Sudan - 45 percent6) Djibouti - 43 percent7) Equatorial Guinea - 42 percent8) Niger - 38 percent9) Mali - 36 percent10) Nigeria - 34 percent(Reporting by Katy Migiro; Editing by Katie Nguyen.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights and climate change.

In both countries, 59 percent of children are out of school.Last month UNICEF said a spike in the forced recruitment of child soldiers in South Sudan could be imminent amid fears the East Africa nation was on the brink of renewed civil war.Although school is vital for children living in crises, education is one of the least funded sectors in humanitarian appeals, the U.N. children’s fund, UNICEF, said in a statement.“For countries affected by conflict, school equips children with the knowledge and skills they need to rebuild their communities once the crisis is over,” UNICEF’s chief of education Jo Bourne said in the statement.“Schools can also protect children from the trauma and physical dangers around them.”Classroom routines can help children psychologically after witnessing atrocities, as well as safeguarding them from abuse, experts say.A crisis fund was launched in May at the World Humanitarian Summit to increase funding for children missing out on school due to war and natural disasters.The West African country of Liberia, which emerged from two civil wars in 2003, temporarily shut its schools to stop the spread of the Ebola epidemic, which ended in June.The 18 million children in the 10 worst countries for access to primary school account for almost one third of the world’s 61 million primary school-aged children who are out of school, UNICEF said.Here are the top 10 countries in the world with the highest proportion of children missing out on primary school:1) Liberia - 62 percent2) South Sudan - 59 percent3) Eritrea - 59 percent4) Afghanistan - 46 percent5) Sudan - 45 percent6) Djibouti - 43 percent7) Equatorial Guinea - 42 percent8) Niger - 38 percent9) Mali - 36 percent10) Nigeria - 34 percent(Reporting by Katy Migiro; Editing by Katie Nguyen.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights and climate change.

Bongo took power in 2009 on the death of his father, who had ruled for 42 years.“Everybody knows that I won the election,” Ping told Reuters, adding that the electoral commission’s figures were based on false documents.“The (Bongo) family are repeating the same scenario for almost half a century. The opposition can win the elections but they have never had access to power... We need assistance from the rest of the world to protect the population of Gabon from a clan of mercenaries, a rogue state,” he said.Opposition supporters greeted the election result with anger. Demonstrators in the capital Libreville clashed with police and set part of the parliament building on fire. It burned for hours before being extinguished, witnesses said.On Thursday there were fresh clashes in the impoverished Nkembo neighborhood near the center of the capital. Gunfire and explosions could be heard, witnesses said. A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called for an immediate end to violence. France is Gabon’s former colonial power and retains strong economic and cultural links.“Within the framework of a political process, there’s no room for violence,” Ayrault said in a statement. “I’m calling, therefore, all parties to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid additional victims.”NO CLEAR PATHFrance, the United States and the European Union urged calm and called on authorities to release the results of individual polling stations for greater transparency, while the United Nations also urged restraint.Bongo won 49.80 percent of votes against 48.23 percent for Ping, on a turnout of 59.46 percent, according to results given region by region by Interior Minister Pacome Moubelet Boubeya.“This victory by such a tight score obliges ... each of us to respect the verdict of the ballot box and our institutions,” Bongo said in the text of a speech distributed to reporters.Ping, a political insider who has served as foreign minister and African Union Commission chairman, was a close ally of the late president and fathered two children with his daughter.His avenue for contesting the result appeared uncertain. Elections in Africa are frequently disputed but it is unusual for results to be overturned.Ping said he was not calling on his supporters to protest because they were already under so much pressure from authorities. He said he feared arms would be planted in his party headquarters and he could be arrested as a result.Voting was peaceful but the election followed a bitter campaign in which both sides traded accusations of fraud. Opposition suspicions were heightened when the release of results was delayed earlier in the week.An EU observer mission criticized a “lack of transparency” among institutions running the election and said Bongo had benefited from preferential access to money and the media.France’s Foreign Ministry also said the way in which the results were announced was a source of concern.“We think it is necessary to publish the results of all the polling stations. The credibility of the election as well as Gabon’s international reputation are at stake,” it said.(Additional reporting by Matthew Mpoke Bigg in Accra, Tim Cocks in Dakar and Joe Bavier in Abidjan; Writing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; Editing by Toby Chopra)"

Mowry told the site that the string of police shootings in recent months has also led to an ongoing discussion with her husband, Cory Hardrict.“I’m a huge advocate about Black Lives Matter and for a while, I had a hard time sleeping,” she said. “I have a son who is black and who is going to be growing up in a society such as this. It’s a conversation that I have with my husband all the time about, what are we going to tell Cree? What are we going to say to him so that he is not put in any circumstance with what’s going on? And it’s hard. It’s hard to face that reality.”Mowry added that she encourages her son to educate himself and always take necessary precautions.“It’s having the conversation and talking to them about the reality of the situation, because when you don’t look at the reality, then you’ll end up doing something and you’ll find yourself being mistreated,” the actress noted. Mowry credits social media as a powerful tool to help highlight the issues affecting local communities.“Thank God that we do live in a society where women and just people in general can have the freedom of speech. That we can say, ‘This is wrong. This is not cool,’” she said. “No matter what we’re talking about. Like I said, whether it’s about what happened in Orlando with the shootings and what’s going on with the Black Lives Matter, I am happy that we do have social media where we can expose prejudices and things that are wrong, and we can create a community to have a voice.”Read more of Tia Mowry’s VIBE interview here."

Burton didn’t mince words when he posted a short clip on Twitter, saying that his life flashed before his eyes.But Ralbovsky said Burton was in no danger as the gator’s mouth had something on it to keep it shut.“My wife, Joanie, was ready to grab the gator, but Steve lifted it higher than she could reach,” he said.Eventually, the Ralbovskys got a hold of the gator, but Burton couldn’t wait to say “see you later.”“That thing was so strong.

But he was also “glad” to be having the conversation.Ruffalo’s comments came after many in the queer community lambasted the film’s announcement. According to Variety, “Anything” will star Bomer as a trans sex worker who begins an “intense friendship” with a suicidal man, played by actor John Carroll Lynch.The “White Collar” and “American Horror Story” star, who is openly gay, joined the ranks of other cisgender actors, including Jared Leto and Eddie Redmayne, who’ve played trans characters. Leto won an Academy Award for his performance in “The Dallas Buyers Club” in 2014, and Redmayne received an Academy Award nomination in 2016 for his work in “The Danish Girl.”LGBT rights advocates have long argued such casting deprives trans actors of roles they’re overwhelmingly qualified for while perpetuating stereotypes about the community.“There are many qualified trans actors and writers who could have played in and advised on the construction of the scenes you’re about to edit into a motion picture.

As a condition of the adult probation, Salvant ordered him to serve 720 days in jail, 180 days for each of the four crash fatalities.Tonya Couch was indicted by a grand jury in May on charges of money laundering and hindering apprehension of her fugitive son. She was released on bond and placed under house confinement.Her curfew was eased in June so she could get a job. She has been working at a Fort Worth-area honky-tonk bar, according to attorney Stephanie Patten."

Once the search was over, federal authorities announced they had recovered approximately 209 pounds of cocaine. Both women were arrested, along with a 63-year-old man named André Tamine, The Associated Press reported.The astonishing twist followed weeks of lavish Instagram travel photos the women posted showing them riding ATVs, bathing in turquoise oceans, sipping on drinks in coconuts, and taking in New York City’s Times Square.“I always said I wanted to do a once in a life time trip,” one photo posted to Roberge’s Instagram account on May 19 read.The trio went before a judge Monday and was charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine. They each face a maximum sentence of life behind bars, authorities said. They were denied bail and their next court appearance is scheduled for October, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.The trio is believed to have been working with a “very well organized syndicate,” the Herald reported, citing the Australian Border Force.“These syndicates should be on notice that the Australian Border Force is aware of all the different ways they attempt to smuggle drugs in our country and we are working with a range of international agencies to stop them,” Australian Border Force Assistant Commissioner Clive Murray said in a statement.Authorities have not said where the drugs are believed to have originated. Photos shared on the women’s Instagram pages show them having traveled to London, Ireland, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, among other countries.Australian Border Force commander Tim Fitzgerald credited the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Canada Border Services Agency for helping flag the trio as “high-risk passengers,” the AP reported.The investigation remains ongoing and additional arrests could be made, the Australian Federal Police stated.

The press release containing the announcement, which was first spotted by a Penn State news website and then reported by Sports Illustrated, did not provide details on what the ceremony will include. Paterno coached at Penn State for more than four decades before he was fired in November 2011, amid the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal that engulfed the football program and the university. Sandusky, a former Penn State assistant coach, was found guilty in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys.The case involved questions about whether Paterno had known about the abuse allegations against Sandusky, and whether he had failed to report knowledge of potential abuse. Paterno died in January 2012, but his family has maintained that the coach did not have any involvement in covering up the scandal. Court documents released in July, however, showed that a man testified in 2014 that he told Paterno in 1976 that Sandusky had abused him at a football camp, but that the head coach ignored his complaint. Paterno had testified in 2011 that he did not first hear of any incident involving Sandusky until 2001. The family again denied that Paterno “engaged in a cover up of Jerry Sandusky’s crimes.”Penn State has been under pressure to honor Paterno in recent months, after more than 200 former football players petitioned the school to replace the statue of Paterno the school removed from outside its football stadium in the wake of the scandal.

Niccolai of the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven. “The decision to immunize a child does not occur in vacuum and is not as straightforward as simply accepting a preventive medical intervention or not.”Current recommendations include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria-acellar pertussis (Tdap) and meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) for boys and girls aged 11 to 12. The researchers used the 2012 National Immunization Survey-Teen to estimate how many teens in each state got at least one dose of these vaccines.The HPV vaccine, which was recommended for girls in 2006 and boys in 2011, protects against cancers caused by HPV infection, which affects about one in four Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends boys and girls get all three shots of the HPV vaccine series.The Tdap vaccine booster helps protect preteens from infections they were vaccinated against as children. The MCV4 vaccine protects against a rare but dangerous bacterial infection of the brain.“The HPV, Tdap, and MCV4 vaccines that we have in the U.S. have very strong safety records and effectively prevent several important diseases,” Niccolai told Reuters Health by email. “They are recommended for all adolescents, so there is no downside to these vaccinations,” and they are covered by insurance or the federal vaccine program for nearly all children.The researchers adjusted for factors that could influence vaccination patterns, including income, education, race and ethnicicty and insurance coverage. Then they calculated the median vaccination rates among blue and red states – meaning half of states had rates above the median for their group.In 2012, Democratic-voting “blue states” had a median of 63 percent coverage for girls and 47 percent coverage for boys for the HPV shot, compared to 56 of girls and 34 percent of boys in Republican-voting “red states.”For Tdap, blue states had a median of 90 percent vaccine coverage for teens, compared to 85 percent in red states. For MCV4, almost 80 percent of teens in half of blue states had been vaccinated compared to 73 percent in red states, as reported in the American Journal of Public Health.“We hypothesized there would be differences for HPV, a sexually transmitted infection, perhaps due to social conservatism found in many Republican states,” Niccolai said. “But we also found differences for MCV4 and Tdap, suggesting something else, perhaps related to political affiliation more broadly, that is important.”Preference for a smaller role of government in personal decision making, typically associated with more Republican views, could lead to individuals rejecting vaccinations that are recommended by federal agencies, she said. But this study alone can’t explain why differences exist between states.Underlying preferences may drive differences in voting patterns and vaccine behavior between states, said W. David Bradford, the Busbee Chair in Public Policy at the University of Georgia in Atlanta.“Remember that Democratic-leaning states tend to be on the coasts and by and large have higher incomes,” Bradford said. “The surprising part is that the authors actually control for many of the things that one would first think of as explaining differences in healthy behaviors (median income, education levels, and insurance, for example) and yet even then the impact of political preferences still mattered.”"
40,POLITICS,Third-Party Candidates Are Getting A Boost In Name Recognition,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-johnson-jill-stein-2016_us_57c739ffe4b0e60d31dcf7ef,Most voters now say they've heard of Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.,2016-08-31,"Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson at a campaign rally in Boston on Aug. 27. He underestimates his name recognition, a new poll shows.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c73d6f1800002100bce6eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Speaking last week to CNN, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson tried to spin his low name-recognition off as an advantage. “Seventy percent of Americans still don’t know who I am, and I think that bodes well for actually winning the race at some point,” he told the network.For better or worse, Johnson was actually selling himself short. While he is still lagging in the horserace polls, trailing even the 15 percent he needs to secure a debate invitation, most voters now at least know who he is, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.Sixty-three percent of voters say they’ve heard of Johnson, up from just 34 percent three months earlier. Twenty-four percent of voters now view the candidate favorably; 24 percent view him unfavorably; 14 percent have heard of him but aren’t sure; and 37 percent still haven’t heard of him.Green Party nominee Jill Stein, who wasn’t included in the May survey, is also now known to a majority of voters, although she’s somewhat less liked. Sixteen percent have a favorable opinion of her; 30 percent have an unfavorable opinion; 14 percent have heard of her but have no opinion; and 41 percent haven’t heard of her at all.That’s far more notoriety than third-party candidates have attracted in the past. During Johnson’s 2012 run for president, for instance, a September Pew Research survey found that more than three-quarters of voters had never heard of him.Still, Johnson and Stein remain lesser-known than nearly all of the Republican presidential hopefuls were in the beginning of January. And they’re still nowhere near matching the near-universal name recognition enjoyed by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Johnson’s increased name recognition also doesn’t seem to have done him much good in polls. HuffPost Pollster’s average shows Johnson pulling in less than 9 percent of the vote, a number that has remained largely unchanged during the past few months. Stein, when she’s included by pollsters, tends to take under 5 percent of the vote.Even that may overstate the percentage of each candidate’s backers who actually make it to the polls.Surveying races that include third-party candidates is a tricky prospect with no easy answers: Polls that ask about those candidates by name tend to overstate their support, while those that exclude them understate it. And as SurveyMonkey’s Mark Blumenthal noted recently, “[T]he voters who opt for Johnson and Stein – often younger and more politically independent – are also less politically engaged and less likely to vote.” According to SurveyMonkey’s tracking poll, nearly half of Johnson and Stein’s supporters give themselves a 50-50 or lower chance of actually voting for those candidates, and only about two-thirds of each candidate’s backers are certain that they’ll vote at all.Still, in a race where more than a third of voters dislike both major candidates, the public seems willing to at least pay more attention than normal to the alternatives.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 25-26 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Sam Kendricks, an American Olympian who halted in the middle of a pole vault attempt in Rio out of respect for the national anthem:”In truth, both men, in their own ways, behaved in a highly patriotic manner that should make all Americans proud,” Abdul-Jabbar wrote.“One of the ironies of the way some people express their patriotism is to brag about our freedoms, especially freedom of speech, but then brand as unpatriotic those who exercise this freedom to express dissatisfaction with the government’s record in upholding the Constitution,” he went on.Abdul-Jabbar defended Kaepernick for taking a stand (or not, as the case may be), particularly because he acted knowing full well there could be backlash.The quarterback’s protest could very well have cost him lucrative endorsement deals, damaged his standing with the team and even put his job at risk. Nevertheless, Kaepernick made his beliefs known in the name of justice.“We should admire those who risk personal gain in the service of promoting the values of their country,” Abdul-Jabbar wrote.He went on: “What should horrify Americans is not Kaepernick’s choice to remain seated during the national anthem, but that nearly 50 years after Ali was banned from boxing for his stance and Tommie Smith and John Carlos’s raised fists caused public ostracization and numerous death threats, we still need to call attention to the same racial inequities.”Kaepernick has said that his actions were a conscious decision not “to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”"
42,BLACK VOICES,It Turns Out Trump Isn’t Speaking To Black Churchgoers In Detroit,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/it-turns-out-trump-isnt-speaking-to-black-churchgoers-in-detroit_us_57c707bfe4b0a22de0938374,Are you surprised?,2016-08-31,Donald Trump has yet to speak directly to black voters and it looks like the wait continues. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c71b841700000011c76c12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Big buzz garnered this week around news that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would be delivering his first speech before congregants at a black church in Detroit, Michigan.It turns out, it was all a farce. Trump’s campaign announced the event on Monday claiming that the candidate would attend Great Faith Ministries to address churchgoers to “outline policies that will impact minorities and the disenfranchised in our country” and answer questions “that are relevant to the African-American community,” according to a statement from Trump surrogate Pastor Mark Burns. Instead, according to the Detroit Free Press, Trump’s appearance will only include a one-on-one interview with the church’s pastor Bishop Wayne T. Jackson. The interview, which will be conducted on the church’s Impact Network, won’t air to the public until at least one week after it's taped. “He’ll be here Saturday. He’s going to sit in service and have the experience in the black church, and then he and I will be in this office and do an interview for the Impact Network that will be aired later on,” Jackson told the paper. “Just like any visitor, there will be fellowship at the service, and he can talk to people one-on-one.”Trump’s resignation from speaking to black voters in Detroit comes on the heels of a new push from his campaign to expand his outreach efforts to black communities. However, so far, attempts to court the black vote, which have been laid out in a number of troubling speeches, have sparked criticism around Trump for merely reinforcing his own base of white, anti-black supporters than to show any real concern for the issues black voters demand that candidates address. Jackson, who told the Detroit Free Press that he has always voted for Democrats, said he feels the same way. He also said he plans to ask Trump if he’s a Christian, and if he’s racist.“He needs to come to African-American communities,” he told the paper. “You can’t talk to African Americans in white venues.”However, Jackson still believes Trump’s visit, which may include a private meeting with a small group of church-goers, will be beneficial in some way.“My congregation trusts my judgment,” he said. “They know that I’m not going to put anything or anyone in front of them that I feel is going to be harmful, and I feel we should have an educated conversation about what you’re going to do.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It’s not just about differences over policy,” Clinton told an American Legion convention in Cincinnati. “It truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as president and commander in chief.”Clinton, a former secretary of state and former U.S. senator, at times sounded like the Republican candidates Trump defeated to win his party’s presidential nomination. She highlighted the United States’ role as a global superpower and celebrated “American exceptionalism,” a term frequently used by conservatives in a foreign-policy context.“When we say America is exceptional ... it means that we recognize America’s unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress,” Clinton told the veterans. “When America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum.”She harshly rebuked Trump, accusing him of advocating a retreat from global affairs and suggesting that his calls for U.S. forces to torture terror suspects and threaten their families would make the country less safe.The speech came on the same day that Trump was slated to meet with Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, in Mexico City in an attempt to bolster his own foreign-policy profile before delivering a speech on immigration policy Wednesday evening in Arizona.In her speech, Clinton cited the endorsements of dozens of members of the Republican foreign-policy establishment. On Wednesday, she secured another one from James Clad, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense under President George W. Bush.In a comment that has sparked criticism from many Republicans, Trump has called the U.S.-led NATO military alliance obsolete, although he has since pledged to work with NATO to defeat Islamic State. He has also vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and to make Mexico pay for it.Brian Katulis, a national-security analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank in Washington, said Clinton’s remarks were in line with “a bipartisan consensus about how we can best keep America safe and secure.”Trump, he said, stands outside that consensus - something the Clinton campaign has attempted to exploit in courting Republican voters concerned about his rhetoric and lack of government experience.John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said Clinton’s approach could peel off some wavering voters, but could cost her support from liberals and others who are wary of overseas conflicts after protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.“It could lose her votes on the left from folks who are tired of us blundering into any more wars,” he said. “Most voters think we should focus on the home front.”(Reporting By Caren Bohan and James Oliphant in Washington and Jonathan Allen in Cincinnati.; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Jonathan Oatis)"

45,POLITICS,Josh Earnest Wants The New York Times To Give Obama Credit For Transparency,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/josh-earnest-transparency-obama_us_57c6f34ae4b078581f1067e7,He makes a tissue-thin case.,2016-08-31,"Josh Earnest keeps using the word ""transparent."" I do not think it means what he thinks it means.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg made the simple observation this week that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, as she crisscrosses the country on the campaign trail, uses two planes ― in one of which she sequesters the traveling press corps. Rutenberg notes, accurately, that this is “a departure from how presidential candidates ... have dealt with their dedicated press corps” since the era of journalists flying hither and yon with presidential contenders began about a half-century ago.Somehow, this piece inspired White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest to dash off a letter to The New York Times, demanding that the paper properly credit President Barack Obama for being a leader in the arena of government transparency. Per Earnest:In “Plane Rides and Presidential Transparency” (Mediator column, Aug. 29), Jim Rutenberg criticized the leading presidential candidates for their lack of transparency, but did not acknowledge the important and unprecedented steps that the Obama administration has taken to fulfill the president’s promise to lead the most transparent White House in history.Having read Rutenberg’s piece, I’m finding it very difficult to fathom (a) how it inspired Earnest’s reaction and (b) how it inspired this reaction in particular. Rutenberg has nothing to say about the larger concept of government transparency ― his column is about the relationship between Clinton and the reporters with whom she travels and the distance at which she keeps them.In fact, Rutenberg makes only passing mention of Obama, though what he does say is absolutely true:Right now, every signal from Mrs. Clinton is that should she win, her administration would continue the tradition of being still more secretive than the one before it; the Obama White House has achieved just that with its abysmal record on fulfilling Freedom of Information Act requests and its record of prosecuting whistle-blowers who have shared national security information with the press.I’m guessing that this is what earned the rancor of Josh Earnest, who I’ll remind you has the specific job of managing the press’s access to the president and shading news stories to the White House’s advantage. In his letter to the Times, it is not a criticism that Earnest responds to particularly well:These accomplishments include, but are not limited to, routinely and proactively releasing the name, date and time of nearly every White House visitor. Some will recall that the previous administration went to the Supreme Court to try to prevent the release of these records.This is not the best case to make if you want to argue that the Obama administration has made major accomplishments in the arena of government transparency. In the first place, while the Data.gov portal is a very nice innovation from a user-interface perspective, it was always possible to obtain the data contained therein. That information, by the way, can fairly be labeled “All The Data The Government Wants You To Have, Anyway,” because if this information was going to be a source of routine trouble to them, they would absolutely make us file a FOIA request to obtain it.Additionally, the White House has a workaround to the whole “White House Visitors’ Log” thing that’s one of the worst-kept secrets in Washington. It’s so poorly kept, in fact, that the very paper from whom Earnest is attempting to obtain “credit” has reported on the workaround at great length. Here’s Eric Lichtblau, from June 2010:Here at the Caribou on Pennsylvania Avenue, and a few other nearby coffee shops, White House officials have met hundreds of times over the last 18 months with prominent K Street lobbyists — members of the same industry that President Obama has derided for what he calls its “outsized influence” in the capital.The only thing that’s changed during the Obama administration is that the Caribou Coffee shop is now a Peet’s Coffee. (In fairness, this is a slight improvement.)And as The Washington Post’s Jason Ross Arnold noted in March 2015:Related to the visitors log is the administration’s checkered support for the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), widely known as the “open meetings law.” The administration did not try to sidestep FACA as frequently as some of its predecessors, but officials have played word games, such as calling private-sector participants on the post-Newtown, Conn., gun control task force “consultants” instead of “members.” That helped the administration conceal meeting records and member names.As for journalists being permitted to attend fundraisers “even when they are held in a private home,” I’d still call that “at best, intermittent access to such events.” The reporters to whom I have unfettered access, in fact, all greet this contention with the hardest of eyerolls, noting that at best we’re talking about momentary access to Obama’s remarks at these fundraisers, not the sort of “all-access pass” situation that Earnest seems to describe above. But don’t take my word for it ― let’s see what we can find in 20 seconds of Googling:Matt Negrin, ABC News, Dec. 9, 2011:With President Obama shifting into campaign mode to raise money for his re-election effort, the White House has generally let reporters inside the events at least long enough to record what he says to his top donors.Justin Sink, The Hill, Oct. 2, 2014:President Obama began his October campaign activities on Thursday — behind closed doors.Colleen Shalby, The Los Angeles Times, April 7, 2016:President Obama dined with Hollywood A-listers and top Disney executives in Los Angeles during a quick visit for political fundraisers.Oh, wait, that’s good news! Reporters got to attend this fundraiser! It was probably a really frabjous day for them, too. However, as Shalby went on to report, it was not to last:On Friday morning, Obama is scheduled to turn his attention to helping Senate Democrats, who have a legitimate chance of reclaiming control of that chamber. He’ll appear at a $33,400-per-couple breakfast hosted by Jennifer and Tobey Maguire in Los Angeles. The event has been described by the White House as a “roundtable” and is closed to reporters.“:( :( :(,” said reporters, I’m sure, faced with this sort of intermittent access. (I guess they’ll all get to brandish Earnest’s letter-to-the-editor in any future instances.)There are, perhaps, better examples that Earnest could use to prop up the notion that Obama deserves credit for transparency, but for him to do so would probably invite scrutiny over what’s really been something of a mixed bag in terms of keeping that promise. All of which leads us back, inevitably, to what Earnest hoped to accomplish by needling the Times over this Rutenberg piece. Per Earnest:If journalists don’t acknowledge steps that the Obama administration has taken to strengthen transparency, then who will? Leading the fight for government transparency means confronting politicians who face intense political pressure on narrow, short-term interests and pressing them to prioritize transparency, too, even when it’s politically inconvenient — especially when it’s politically inconvenient. In this regard, impartial journalists are advocates.So, if I have this straight, we cannot reasonably expect Hillary Clinton to have reporters with her on the same plane unless those same reporters bend over backward to constantly point out what a great job the Obama administration has done to “strengthen transparency.”But if we accepted this task, citing the same areas that Earnest cites ― a new government website, the visitors’ log “reform,” reporters at fundraisers ― not only would we be doing a disservice to our readers by pretending that these were, indeed, special examples of openness when they aren’t; we’d actually be sending an entirely different message to “future presidential candidates”: “Walk all over us, we don’t care.”Again, it’s very strange that Earnest picked this particular Rutenberg piece and this particular moment to come in hotter than a plate of tater tots, complaining about the short shrift Obama is getting in terms of transparency. He could have just as easily let this matter slide. But that he went in on this with an argument as transparently nontransparent as the one he offered ... well, it tells you all you need to know, doesn’t it?~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."

Penzone, a former Phoenix police officer who is expected to present a tough challenge to Arpaio in November, lost to the longtime sheriff in 2012 by six percentage points.Arpaio, 84, was expected to win his primary despite a judge’s request that criminal contempt charges be brought against him stemming from a 2007 racial profiling case where he was found to have violated the constitutional rights of Latino motorists.The investigation and possible prosecution was turned over to the U.S. Justice Department last week. It was not clear when a decision would be made.Arpaio, who styles himself as America’s toughest sheriff, said his looming legal battles apparently had no effect on the primary race.”I think the people understand that they should not believe everything they hear,” Arpaio told Reuters in a telephone interview. “They support me as they always have and that feels good.”Saban has called on Arpaio to resign, saying the sheriff has “soiled his badge” and made himself ineffective as a lawman.Saban declined comment on the election results through a spokesman, adding that he would issue a statement on Wednesday morning.Arpaio, along with three others, could face incarceration and fines if convicted of any criminal charges. Arpaio and his second-in-command, Gerard Sheridan, already have been cited and admitted to civil contempt.The charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of Latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease.Opponents also have targeted the profiling lawsuit’s high cost to the county, which will have spent an estimated $54 million on the case by next summer."
