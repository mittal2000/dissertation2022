0,POLITICS,Low and Unrepresentative Voter Turnout in California,"Rob Richie, ContributorExecutive director, FairVote",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/low-and-unrepresentative_b_5592196.html,,2014-07-16,2014-07-16-1280px1_yosemite_valley_tunnel_view_2010.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-16-1280px1_yosemite_valley_tunnel_view_2010-thumb.JPG,"Written with Duncan Hosie, this is the first in a two-part series about voter turnout decline in California and ideas to reverse it. In this introduction, we review turnout decline, disparities in who votes, and the particular problem of abstention in primary elections. In 1943, author William Faulkner tartly described California as the state where ""the sun shines and nothing happens."" His observation aptly describes California's June 2014 primary election. Despite clear skies and warm sunshine, more than three-quarters of registered voters did not vote. Turnout of registered voters, at 25.1%, was a record low. Yet this statistic conceals the extent of low turnout. In May 2014, California had 24,192,752 eligible voters, of whom 17,722,006 had registered to vote. Based on California's much larger number of eligible voters, turnout was even lower: a meager 18%.The turnout in 2014 may have been a historic low, but it reflects long-term trends in California democratic participation. While turnout rates remains higher than those of many states, they are down precipitously from the mid-20th Century, when the Golden State led the nation with some of the highest turnout rates in primary elections. Between 1950 and 1966, for example, an average of 63% of registered voters participated in primary elections. In the past decade, however, California primary turnout has been far lower. Turnout in state primaries was 34.6% in 2002, 33.6% in 2006, 28.2% in 2008, 33.3% in 2010, and 33.1% in 2012. The introduction of the Top Two primary in 2012 and the presence of presidential contests in 2008 and 2012 failed to salvage turnout. This year's 25.1% turnout marked the lowest turnout yet.Consider one precinct in Sonoma County, which epitomizes voter apathy in the primary election. The Sonoma State University precinct in Rohnert Park opened at 7 AM and remained open until 8 PM. Despite serving 8,000 registered voters, zero people voted in person. That is not a typo; zero people voted at a Rohnert Park precinct on June 3, 2014.The dramatic increase in vote-by-mail and early voting ballots partially explains why so few Californians voted in person at the Rohnert Park precinct and others across the state. In Sonoma County, for example, 81% of the 98,728 ballots cast in the June 2014 primary election were absentee ballots. California's vote-by-mail patterns have surged- from 5% of all primary ballots in 1980 to 25% in 1998 to 65% today. But even if often popular among regular voters, voting-by-mail is far from a panacea to low voter turnout. According to data from the California Secretary of State, the sharp rise in voting-by-mail since 1980, with particular growth in the past 10 years, has corresponded with steep declines in primary election turnout. California's northern neighbor, Oregon, relies on a VBM (vote by mail) system, and also experienced declining turnout in the most recent primary election.Low Turnout, Unrepresentative DemocracyThe few who did vote in the primary were older, whiter, and wealthier than registered voters and Californians as a whole. In the words of Corey Cook, the director of the University of San Francisco's Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service, the voters in the 2014 primary were ""not at all [reflective] of the population of the state."" Non-Hispanic whites are only 39% of the entire California population and 53.6% of the citizen voting age population, but comprised three in four likely voters according to a Field Poll. Only one in eight (12%) Californians are over 65, but this cohort composed more than a third (35%) of likely voters.A pre-primary poll from the Los Angeles Times and USC Dornsife College replicated these findings, and demonstrated that primary voters are disproportionately wealthy. According to the poll, 30% of the registered voters had voters over $75,000, compared to 35% of likely primary voters. The poll also illustrated that 15% of responders who had incomes lower than $20,000 had voted in the past two primaries, compared to 34% of respondents whose incomes were between $75,000 and $100,000 and 35% of respondents whose incomes were greater than $100,000. A FairVote analysis of May poll by the Los Angeles Times underscores the highly unrepresentative nature of participation California primaries relating to particularly large skews by race and age.There is a partisan element as well - one that also affects which candidates reach the November ballot. According to the California Secretary of State, 28.4% of registered voters in May 2014 were Republicans, as opposed to 43.4% of registered voters as Democrat. But a Field Poll of likely primary voters in May found that 37% were Republicans. Unaffiliated and independent voters were also unrepresented. Despite composing 28.2% of registered voters, a Survey USA poll demonstrated that this cohort was just 23% of likely voters. Moreover, the May Los Angeles Times poll found that only 11% of non-major party respondents had voted both the 2010 and 2012 primaries, as opposed to 26% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans.Why does this matter? In analyzing the 2012 elections, Daily Kos reported that Democratic performance in competitive California primaries was almost always better in November than in the June primary. Out of 13 competitive California House seats in 2012, Democrats performed considerably better in 12 of the general election contests than in the primary races. Yet these less representative primary electorates determine which candidates advance to November - and in some cases (like the 31st congressional district last year and the 25th district this year) keep one party entirely out of general elections that should be very competitive between the major parties.Low Voter Engagement and Enthusiasm: An Entrenched ProblemIn addition to low and unrepresentative voter turnout, the recent primary election was notable for another reason: a distinct lack of voter engagement and enthusiasm. A survey of 901 likely primary voters found that only 46% had been following the election ""closely."" In comparison, 67% of California likely voters in the 2010 primary and 68% in the 2006 primary reported that they had been following those respective contests ""closely."" Despite voter apathy, however, primary voters indicated concern with low electoral participation. In a survey of nearly 1,000 primary voters, 89% believed low voter turnout is ""a cause for concern.""Although low turnout in California primaries presents a particularly entrenched problem, the Golden State's voter turnout problem extends to general elections. Turnout in general elections has varied over the years, but California voter turnout in general elections is below the national average and moving in the wrong direction. California's VEP (voting eligible population) turnout in the 2006 midterm election, at 42%, was the 31st highest in the country. California's turnout in the 2008 presidential election (62.5%) was the 33rd highest in America. In 2012, only 55.9% of California's voting eligible population came to the polls, or the 41st highest in the nation.To be continued in Part 2 of our analysis."

Israel will expand its week-long military campaign in the Gaza Strip if Hamas refuses to accept an Egyptian ceasefire plan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned.

I'm doing whatever I'm doing -- folding laundry, unwrapping a sandwich, crossing the street -- when a siren begins to wail. It oscillates loud-soft, loud-soft, like a swing approaching-receding, approaching-receding.The people around me have mixed reactions. Most rush for shelter. One woman huddles on the ground, with her knees to her chest, in tears. Some teens, nonchalant, lean against a wall, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes. Like most foreigners, I skittishly follow the ""guidelines for an event of missile attack,"" which boil down to, ""duck and cover away from things that could collapse or shatter.""There is a boom and a smoke cloud in the sky to the east. The siren continues. There is another boom and two smoke clouds to the south. The siren stops. Three rockets were shot down by the Iron Dome, Israel's highly effective missile defense system.The teens are snapping pictures of the smoke clouds with their phones. A stranger helps the crying woman to her feet. People come out from cover and go back to doing whatever they were doing. I continue crossing the street, unwrapping a sandwich, folding laundry.The variable reactions are due to individuals' previous experiences. People who have grown up with sirens, but have never witnessed a tragedy are desensitized. People who have suffered trauma related to this 50-plus year conflict are hypersensitive. I don't feel like I belong to this scene, or that I am entitled to a marked reaction. I try to be stoic and inconspicuous.This is not what happens when rockets are sent to Gaza. They have no defense system. Although I have not witnessed it first hand, by most accounts missiles to Gaza bring fire, screams, chaos, and death. They obliterate their terrorist targets, but these targets are located in heavily populated areas. Based on population density numbers, it's like trying to take out basement terrorist liars in downtown Boston with long-range missiles. The missiles hit the targets and more. Israeli leaders claim they are trying to minimize civilian deaths, and yet the UN estimates about 70 percent of the fatalities have been civilian. The numbers keep rising, but the death toll from rockets approaches 200 in Gaza and remains zero in Israel.The sides are not the Palestinians of Gaza against the Jews of Israel. The sides are parties within the State of Israel and terrorists of Hamas, and both of these sides should be condemned by the international finger-pointers. However, the difference in apparent moral culpability lies in the nature of the shields protecting each side. The State of Israel has the Iron Dome, which vaporizes offensive strikes into cloud puffs, whereas Hamas hides behind a human shield, the civilians and innocents of Gaza. Both sides understand the difference between these shields. Neither is ceasing their fire. The international community rightly expects Israel to take the higher ground, to spare the innocent Gazans, but we should not forget that Hamas is sacrificing the people they claim to be liberating. They fire at Israel to free the Palestinians, and then they hide behind the Palestinians when Israel fires back.The physical threat of rockets in Israel is nominal. Fewer than ten injuries have resulted from over 800 missiles. But the emotional and mental toll is substantial. Yes, some Israelis are even Instagramming the failed attacks, mocking them. But that woman crying on the pavement, she has felt the worst of this endless conflict. Maybe she has been in a bus bombing or witnessed someone beaten to death or lost a child. For whatever reason, for her and many others in Israel, every siren symbolizes past pain and imminent loss. This is not a healthy psyche for a country. There are too many decades of trauma for Israeli political leaders to not support firing back.You still say, ""Why doesn't Israel just do the right thing and stop?"" It's a good question. The answer is probably similar to that of, ""Why doesn't the United States pass gun control legislation?"" It's because political popularity, not morals, are dictating the ethics and action.My point is that you can condemn Israel's recent behavior, but do it with awareness and empathy.Annelia Alex writes a regular blog at bannelia.com"
5,RELIGION,Sherlock Holmes Versus God Almighty: Who Is More Real?

Much as an infinitely perfect God leads to logical clashes with reality, an infinite multiverse bedevils attempts to apply tools such as probabilities to our understanding of the world.",2014-07-15,2014-07-15-Benedict_Cumberbatch_filming_Sherlock_cropped.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-15-Benedict_Cumberbatch_filming_Sherlock_cropped-thumb.jpg,"All stories are true.On its face, this is a preposterous statement. By definition fiction is false. The tourists who for decades sought out 221B Baker Street in hopes of glimpsing Sherlock Holmes were barking up an imaginary tree after fictional prey: neither the address nor the sleuth existed. Since then, the address has come into existence as the Sherlock Holmes Museum and the story has been updated, but the man remains a myth. Benedict Cumberbatch only plays Holmes. There is no such person. The lawyer's familiar disclaimer, ""Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental,"" guarantees it. Right? Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes (Creative Commons)Well, as physicist Sean Carroll likes to remind us, we live in a preposterous universe. If, as many cosmologists now argue, we occupy a dot in an endless multiverse, then all stories that can be true must be true. Somewhere out there, the real Sherlock pursues the real Moriarty. Somewhere out there Dudley Do-Right rescues Nell. Somewhere, Huck Finn and Jim really are drifting down the big river. How can that be the case? As it appears, lots of ways. If the Totalitarian Principle holds, it cannot be otherwise. That principle of quantum mechanics, enunciated by Nobel laureate physicist Murray Gell-Mann, tells us ""Everything not forbidden is compulsory."" In Our Mathematical Universe, physicist Max Tegmark points out that if the universe simply goes on forever, then just as a deck of cards endlessly shuffled and dealt will produce every possible hand, we must expect to find every possible combination of particles, including arrangements called Sherlock, Dudley, and Huck. But Tegmark adds that the same result arrives if eternal inflation proves true. Inflation, the fantastically rapid swelling of the universe after the Big Bang, followed by a much slower local expansion, is the best explanation we have for the observable bubble around us. It, too, yields endless bubbles of every variety.Brian Greene, in his book The Hidden Reality, concurs. Like Tegmark, he admits that multiverse ideas, though mathematically sound, are speculative. But Greene points with confidence to yet another route to everythingness: the Many Worlds understanding of quantum mechanics. In contrast to the multiverse, quantum weirdness is observable and undeniable. But explaining what goes on when a particle drops out of superposition has been, to say the least, a challenge.Many Worlds is now the most widely accepted explanation -- among physicists, anyway. For the rest of us it is a jaw-dropping, ""say whut, now?"" kind of story. Quantum mechanics tells us that when a particle such as an electron decoheres out of the vagaries of superposition it could be anywhere -- though it is more likely to be ""here"" rather than ""there."" Many Worlds tells us that what happens is the Universe, complete with a copy of you, me, and the electron, splits into many copies with outcomes proportional to the odds regarding ""here"" and ""there."" Most of the time you end up in the copy with high odds. Once in awhile you get a surprise. Seen from ""above"", everything happens. Including ""fiction."" Well, not all fiction. Stories of the impossible -- say, Noah's flood or Harry Potter -- don't happen anywhere. Or do they? Tegmark and others encourage us to think about yet more universes, ones where the laws of physics themselves vary. Hah, you say. When pigs fly! But why not? An endless multiverse need not have uniform laws. If the rules that govern the behavior of everything can take every possible form, then what's left on the forbidden list? Mount your brooms! Bring on the flying pigs! Expecto Patronum!Curiously, though, something is excluded. It comes not from science but from religion. That something is God. Traditional theism holds that God is supremely perfect in three ways: power, knowledge, and goodness.A longstanding objection to this claim is the Problem of Evil. How, it asks, can a perfect being allow evil to exist? A body of apologetics devoted to staving off the Problem of Evil has followed, with answers that range from blaming Eve to disputing the existence of a best of all possible worlds.In the teeth of an infinite multiverse, all these defenses collapse. A God who allows everything to happen makes no choices at all, and therefore cannot be a theistic God in any meaningful sense. At most, he can be a Creator, but that's hardly better. If all outcomes are realized, then there's no difference between a personal creator and an impersonal creative force. This realization makes a paradox of the biblical claim ""with God, all things are possible."" If that dismays you, here are some comforting thoughts. Consider: if the more radical of multiverse scenarios is true, then somewhere must be a happy place called heaven where, the moment your earthly consciousness comes to an end, an identical copy of it will continue to exist. Sadly, however, the same must be true for an unpleasant place called hell.Greater comfort, I think, is to be found in the realization that infinity is as problematic for science as it is for religion. Much as an infinitely perfect God leads to logical clashes with reality, an infinite multiverse bedevils attempts to apply tools such as probabilities to our understanding of the world. If everyone who buys a lottery ticket is a winner in some universe, why don't we all feel like winners? All those copies, including the one with the winning ticket, are genuinely us. What does it mean to hew to the average in an infinity of outcomes?Of course, the world may be preposterous. Perhaps, like infinities, ultimate answers are unattainable or meaningless. But it's also possible that a more modest, elegant, and satisfying penultimate answer exists. The only way to know is to have faith in the future and to move ahead with an open-minded, rigorous search for as much of the truth as can be grasped -- the search we call science."

Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) are once again at odds over key issues, as Brown campaigns to unseat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).Ayotte, who officiated at the wedding of Brown's daughter on Sunday, got to know Brown when he served as a Massachusetts senator before losing his seat to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). He has since relocated to New Hampshire to challenge Shaheen.Ayotte endorsed Brown, but by attacking Shaheen's positions on immigration and veterans' affairs he is effectively disparaging Ayotte's record as well. That's because Ayotte's positions on these issues resemble Shaheen's.For instance, in a press release distributed on June 11, Brown stated, ""Senator Shaheen today said that illegal immigrants descending on the southern border are fleeing violence based on gang and drug activity and that ‘refugees’ in danger of immediate threats back home should be allowed to stay in the United States. I disagree with Senator Shaheen on both the cause and the solution. The crisis on the border is mainly the result of the pro-amnesty policies supported by President Obama and Senator Shaheen, which have encouraged more and more people to come here illegally. While we need to act humanely, these new arrivals should be returned to their home countries.""However, Shaheen and Ayotte voted in support of legislation to provide undocumented immigrants with a path to citizenship, while also increasing border security. Ayotte said the bill would “finally secure our borders and fix our broken immigration system.”In addition to immigration, Brown is targeting the scandals surrounding the Department of Veterans Affairs. In an ad released Monday, Brown charges that the ""Obama-Shaheen economy"" does not work for veterans or anyone else, and that veterans ""deserve better than long waits for patient care and national scandal.""A recent article published by the New Hampshire Union Leader, however, praises efforts by both Shaheen and Ayotte to reform New Hampshire's Manchester VA Medical Center. The same article points out that Shaheen has not only sponsored various bills in response to the VA crisis, but that she has also co-authored legislation with Ayotte on the subject.This is not the first time that Ayotte and Brown's positions have been at odds. Ayotte voted for Shaheen's energy efficiency legislation earlier this year, despite Brown's attempt to block the bill. He was hoping to deprive Shaheen of a legislative victory to tout during her campaign and had even called Ayotte to discuss the bill. Ayotte, however, said she did what she thought was best for her state.The New Hampshire Republican State Committee downplayed any hint of a rift between the two, claiming Brown hadn't lobbied Ayotte at all, regardless of their discussions.Ayotte remains supportive of Brown's campaign. On Tuesday, she was fundraising on Brown's behalf.""Scott Brown is exactly what New Hampshire needs right now: someone who will always put people ahead of politics,"" she said."

It felt, at the time, freeing and hedonistic.But he hadn’t been wearing a condom when they had sex, and in the morning, he woke up wanting nothing more than to regain control over that moment.

Terrified that might change, he went to Callen-Lorde, a health clinic in Chelsea, where he was placed on a 28-day course of a full HIV-medication regimen. When taken within three days of exposure, it dramatically reduces the chances of infection—something like the morning-after pill for HIV.

At a press event Tuesday, six conservative congressmen predicted that impeachment would not happen before the November midterm elections, saying it would be politically damaging for the GOP and unlikely to succeed.""The president deserves to be impeached, plain and simple,"" Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) said. ""We've got so much on our plate, it's not practical, we don't have the Senate ... I don't think it's practical that we impeach him right now. But he definitely deserves it.""Last week, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin (R) called for Obama's impeachment, citing a ""purposeful dereliction of duty."" Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) said Tuesday that only a small fraction of Republicans agree with Palin. He said he does not think Obama's actions have reached the level to qualify for impeachment. ""I believe that Sarah Palin, who has given us good information on some issues, doesn't have the burden of leadership right now,"" Labrador said. ""It's really easy for her to go on Fox News and make statements that she doesn't have to be accountable [for] to anybody but herself.""Rep. John Duncan (R-Tenn.) said he worried that impeachment could be politically disastrous for Republicans in November.""Every political analyst, almost, that's really looked at this ... has said that nothing would fire up the base of the Democrats more than an impeachment action, and also perhaps more importantly that it would turn off some of the independents who are right now leaning our way, "" Duncan said. ""If you want to help the Democrats keep control of the Senate, this would be one way to do it, to start impeachment action.""""When someone's shooting themselves in the foot, we shouldn't take their gun away from them,"" Duncan added.Before moving on to another question, Labrador gave one final reason for Republicans to steer clear of the impeachment issue.

In an unaired ABC News segment from Friday, Attorney General Eric Holder revealed that his department would join the cases. The Justice Department provided the transcript to MSNBC. “We have already filed suit in Texas and North Carolina,"" Holder said. ""I expect that we are going to be filing in cases that are already in existence in Wisconsin as well as in Ohio.""Holder told ABC the right to vote is “the most basic of all our rights,"" and said that he will ""use every power that I have, every ability that I have as Attorney General to defend that right to vote.” The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups are challenging restrictions passed in Ohio that cut early voting days, ended same-day registration and removed early voting on Sundays and weekday evenings. A federal judge restored early voting that takes place on the last three days before the election in June. However, the other restrictions will still go into effect. Civil rights proponents say such restrictions disproportionately affect groups including minorities, students and seniors.They charge in their complaint filed July 1 that the new restrictions would “directly deny the franchise or otherwise make it significantly more difficult for tens of thousands of Ohioans to vote,’’ asserting that the changes “will be felt most keenly among lower-income voters who are predominately African-American.”In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker (R) signed a bill  in March limiting early voting in the state. In April, a federal judge struck down the state's law requiring voters to produce state-approved photo identification cards at the polls. Such legislation could have a significant impact on turnout leading up to and during November's general election in states with competitive gubernatorial contests. Democratic gubernatorial candidates in both Ohio and Wisconsin said they were cheered by Holder's comments Tuesday. ""I'm pleased that the U.S. Department of Justice will be joining the fight to protect voter rights in Ohio,"" Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald said in a statement. ""Under Governor Kasich, access to the polls has significantly decreased for hardworking Ohioans across the state. Voting is a fundamental right and, as Governor, I'll do everything in my power to protect it.""Businesswoman Mary Burke, who is challenging Walker, also heralded Holder's move. ""Scott Walker's refusal to drop his crusade for photo ID requirements is a slap in the face to Veterans, seniors and students,"" Burke Communications Director Joe Zepecki said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. ""The costs associated with this ongoing legal battle are a waste of taxpayer money. Mary Burke could not disagree with Walker more on this issue, she believes that every eligible voter who wishes to cast a ballot should have the opportunity to do so. Which is why in addition to opposing photo ID requirements, she will seek to roll back Walker's restrictions on early voting.""The Justice Department is currently challenging voter identification laws and other restrictions in North Carolina and Texas in response to last year’s Shelby v. Holder ruling, which invalidated Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. That Supreme Court decision meant that states with a history of race bias in voting are no longer required to clear changes to their voting laws with the federal government. "

In 2014, he delivered the commencement address at Georgetown University.He told Catholic News Service that he believes that Catholic scientists should not hesitate to share their love of science with their communities, in order to show that the Church is not opposed to science. “Show them that our religion does not tell us what ‘facts’ we can believe, but rather our religion gives us the reason why we go looking to try to understand those facts,” he said. Consolmagno credits his Jesuit background with allowing him to help talk about his faith in a public manner. “I can concentrate on communicating my passion for my science and let my collar do the rest of the talking for me. It has been one of the greatest blessings of my vocation,” he said, according to the Catholic Sun.

Their potential to function as artificial reef systems seems impossible. Yet, the Rig2Reef Explorers of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Amber Jackson, Ashleigh Palinkas and myself, have found that offshore oil and gas platforms provide one of the most unique artificial ecosystems in California. Artificial reefs are not all created equal. The location, substrate material, structure size and time of year, all effect the variety and density of species found there. So how do oil platforms differ from other types of artificial reefs, such as sunken ships? To explore this question, we set out on an expedition to dive three oil platforms -- Eureka, Elly and Ellen -- in addition to the shipwreck Olympic II, an artificial reef structure very unique from the platforms we have investigated thus far.Our morning began with us plunging into the surprisingly temperate waters off of San Pedro to dive the Olympic II. The 258-foot Olympic II sank on the morning of September 4, 1940, taking with her the lives of eight men; she was discovered by salvage divers in the 1960s and since then the wreck, sitting in about 100 feet of water has been a popular dive spot for recreational divers to explore and seek out the large sea bass, broom tail grouper and bat stars that hide amongst the wreckage. Although the visibility was lacking on this first dive, with a max of about 10 feet -- it was abundantly clear that the species that called this hulk their home were very different then those found amongst the legs of the platforms. These were more cryptic species -- many of which we had not yet encountered on our platform dives, and schooling fish were entirely absent, as were the colorful waving brittle stars.Our dives on Eureka, Elly and Ellen, however, were entirely different stories. Eureka, in particular was a spectacular dive. As the largest platform accessible to divers off the coast of California standing in just over 720 feet of water, Eureka boasted an immense and colorful reef. We found ourselves transfixed by the thousands of schooling sardines, tired, but determined Garibaldi defending there newly laid clutches of eggs and jacks hustling betwixt the beams. These platforms were not only rich with life, but diver friendly, allowing relatively unrestrained access to their reefs below -- some divers even proceeded to harvest enormous scallops the size of tennis balls from her legs. Despite California's law requiring that artificial reefs be placed in areas where they are needed, we found it difficult to deem these artificial structures teeming with life, as not needed. Life thrived amongst the beams of every platform, just as the larger deeper species claimed the ghostly wreckage of the Olympic II to be home. Not only were we able to take away the recreational value of the vibrant beauty generated by the species decorating these platforms -- but we also glimpsed the sustainable harvesting potential of these platforms. A harvest that we not only witnessed, but enjoyed whilst snacking away between dives on raw scallops scraped from Elly, Ellen and Eureka's legs. In this way, we participated in the small circle of life that thrived quietly beneath the industry of oil above."

Armageddon. The End Times. The Rapture. Ragnarok. There are many different terms for the end of humanity brought on as part of a divine plan or by the deities themselves, but most religions maintain a similar belief that mankind will eventually experience some sort of reckoning at the hands of the gods. Some of those who do believe in this ""end times"" scenario will resort to extreme actions in order to prepare, such as selling their homes, quitting their jobs, blowing up their family pets, and even committing suicide. And fringe groups aren't the only ones who believe in these apocalyptic situations, as many mainline Protestants believe in the second coming of Christ, and Muslims, Hindus, and other mainstream faiths contain similarly destructive scenarios in their scriptures. In fact, this death-cult mentality is shared by many: Some 22 percent of Americans believe that the world will end during their lifetime.This fatalistic belief in the end of humanity, most often because of our sins or lack of virtue, is as frightening as it is harmful. If we believe that no matter what we do, the majority of us will perish in some reign of heavenly or demonic fire, what is our motivation to plan for our collective future? Humanism is opposed to this ideology, not only because it's always based on unprovable religious superstition but because humanists believe strongly that the fate of humanity is not subject to divine whims but rests with humanity itself. For this reason, humanists work hard to ensure that our collective future is one that is sustainable and desirable for all. This motivates strong support of the environment because a stable ecosystem is necessary for a long-term existence. Humanists are also supporters of governmental policies that promote peace and mutual disarmament, because constant war is untenable and could mean the destruction of all life on the planet. And humanists are supporters of scientific inquiry, for without it we are vulnerable to diseases and natural catastrophes.The religious predictions of how the world will end are rejected by humanists not because we think that humanity is invulnerable but because we recognize that there are real threats to humanity's survival, and that by focusing on unrealistic and uncontrollable ""end times"" distractions we neglect to take ownership of our own choices, and in the process decrease our chances for continued existence. Our opposition to this religious fatalism is motivated entirely by our own belief that the ability of our species to preserve itself is entirely in our own hands and minds. We need not be afraid of the four horsemen, or of Jesus' return in a chariot of flames; rather, we should fear uncontrolled pollution, high-stakes warfare, underfunded scientific and medical research, and apathy from leaders and common citizens when it comes to solving our own problems. We can survive and thrive, but we will only do so if we reject the idea that we are all doomed to die because of what ancient books and divine prophesies tell us. Instead, let's embrace the notion that our future is what we make of it."
