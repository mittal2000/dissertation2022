By banning fracking, Governor Andrew Cuomo has acted to protect his state's citizens from a rapacious industry whose presence would inevitably result in significant health and environmental consequences.",2014-12-19,"Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo attends The Friars Foundation Gala honoring Robert De Niro and Carlos Slim at The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2014, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb162912400003100554270.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In New York State, at least, sanity has prevailed. By banning fracking, Governor Andrew Cuomo has acted to protect his state's citizens from a rapacious industry whose presence would inevitably result in significant health and environmental consequences.It's hard to overstate how important this victory is. For the past five years, New York has been one of the few states wise enough to maintain a moratorium on a practice that has devastated thousands of neighborhoods and thousands of square miles of landscapes across the United States. Fortunately, after receiving a report from the state's Health Department that found fracking could pose ""significant public health risks,"" Governor Cuomo concluded that even a single fracking site in New York State would be one too many.The final decision may have been the governor's, but the real credit for victory over the immensely powerful fossil fuel lobby goes to the passionate anti-fracking activists of New York. Thousands of ordinary (and not so ordinary!) people worked tirelessly to spread the word about the dangers of fracking. They pushed for a moratorium when few thought it was possible. They faced years of opposition from the oil and gas industry and their friends in government, and they never gave up. So this is their hard-earned and well-deserved victory, but it's also something more. It's a ringing affirmation that grassroots organizing really is powerful enough to stop these polluters before they can even get started. That lesson will be taken to heart in hundreds, if not thousands, of communities across the country. Organize and work together, and you can stop the frackers, stop the coal trains, stop the gas-export terminals, and start racing toward 100 percent clean energy for everyone.Activists in New York fought to stop fracking for the same reasons that the Sierra Club opposes it: the appalling risks and destructive footprint. But in New York, as elsewhere, fracking is all the more foolish when much better energy options await full development. New York has a tremendous economic opportunity in renewable energy. Its Renewable Portfolio Standard, with a goal of 30 percent renewable energy by 2015, has already been successful at bringing new projects online, including 21 new wind farms. It has helped create hundreds of new jobs and driven $2.7 billion in direct investments in the state. However, the program will sunset in 2015.Although the Cuomo administration has launched several energy initiatives to transform the electricity sector, none of those programs includes measurable benchmarks for getting renewable energy to scale. This week, the Long Island Power Authority's Board of Trustees voted to approve just a fraction of the renewable energy contracts promised by Governor Cuomo in his LIPA reform legislation. So although the governor has demonstrated that he's serious about protecting the health and well-being of New Yorkers, he needs to show the same kind of leadership in developing a strong, prosperous renewable energy economy for New York.One more thing: Now that Governor Cuomo has announced to the world that fracking is too dangerous for New York, how can the governors of other states justify accepting those same risks? Are the risks and the destruction of fracking somehow more acceptable if you live in California, Ohio, Illinois, or Maryland? Do the people living in those states have less to lose than New Yorkers do? Of course not. New York has its fracking ban, which is a wonderful thing. Now it's time to protect the rest of America from fracking and let our country transition to the prosperous, clean-energy economy that we need. "

According to a new French study, men who prefer hotter foods tend to have higher testosterone levels than man who prefer mild foods.The research, recently published in the journal Physiology & Behavior, polled 114 men aged 18 to 44 on their spice preferences. The men were also served a dish of mashed potatoes, and allowed to put as much hot sauce or salt as they liked on it. The University of Grenoble researchers found that men with higher testosterone levels (as tested by their saliva) both indicated a greater preference for hot sauce, and used more of it to season the potato. The amount of salt used, however, had no relation to testosterone levels. A man's preference for capsaicin, the compound in chili peppers that makes them spicy, has been previously linked to dominance behaviors, aggression and risk-taking, the researchers note. However, the direction of causality is unclear -- the preference for spicy tastes could be driven by either physiology or environmental factors. It's also likely to vary culturally. A Frenchman, for instance, may have a different approach to spicy foods than men from southeast Asia or Mexico, for instance, who likely grew up eating spicy foods and may have built up a tolerance. Previous research has shown that the more people are exposed to capsaicin, the more favorably they tend to rate its taste. ""The underlying cause of the use of spice by individuals with high testosterone levels should be further analyzed, as it might be the result of learned or innate preferences,"" the researchers conclude. Previous research has linked high testosterone levels with a heightened sex drive, a preference for the color red and risky behavior. "

As usual, this top 10 list is limited to policy progress relating to marijuana in the United States. That is, the list excludes non-psychoactive hemp, breakthrough research, celebrity endorsements, and the like.1. LEGALIZATION IN OREGON: On November 4, an impressive 55 percent of Oregon voters passed a ballot initiative to legalize marijuana for adults 21 and older, similar to the initiatives that passed two years ago in Colorado and Washington.2. LEGALIZATION IN ALASKA: Also on November 4, 53 percent of Alaska voters passed a similar legalization initiative. As a result, Alaska and Oregon became the third and fourth states to end marijuana prohibition.3. TWIN REFORMS IN MARYLAND: In April, Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) signed a bill legalizing medical marijuana in Maryland; at the same time, he signed a bill decriminalizing marijuana possession in the state. This was the first time that any governor signed two substantial marijuana policy reform bills at the same time.4. TWIN REFORMS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: In March, the local D.C. government enacted a law decriminalizing marijuana possession in our nation's capital. Then, on November 4, 70 percent of D.C. voters passed a ballot initiative to remove all penalties for personal possession and home cultivation of marijuana. (It remains to be seen whether a recent act of Congress will block the voter initiative from taking effect.)5. CONGRESS REINS IN THE DEA: This month, Congress and President Obama enacted a massive spending bill for FY 2015 that, in part, prevents the U.S. Justice Department -- which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration -- from spending money to interfere with state-level medical marijuana laws. (This will expire on September 30 but could be renewed annually each fall.)6. MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN MINNESOTA: After nine years of lobbying by advocates and patients in St. Paul, the Minnesota Legislature enacted a law in May to allow certain patients to use marijuana in a non-smokable form.7. MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN NEW YORK STATE: After 12 years of lobbying by advocates and patients in Albany, the New York Legislature enacted a law in July that's similar to the Minnesota law.8. MEDICAL MARIJUANA LOSS IN FLORIDA: On November 4, 58 percent of Florida voters voted in favor of a medical marijuana initiative. Because all Florida initiatives require 60 percent of the vote to pass, the medical marijuana initiative failed. But the close vote during a hostile midterm election means Florida voters will very likely pass a similar initiative during the presidential election in November 2016.9. 25 LOCAL INITIATIVES IN FOUR STATES: On November 4, voters in 23 local jurisdictions passed marijuana-related initiatives, joining two more that had passed local initiatives in August. In South Portland, Maine, voters legalized marijuana possession. In the two biggest counties in New Mexico and eight cities in Michigan, voters decriminalized marijuana possession. And in 14 state legislative districts in Massachusetts, voters instructed their state legislators to support legislation to legalize marijuana.10. MARIJUANA ON TRIBAL LANDS: This month, the U.S. Justice Department issued a memo stating it would not interfere with the cultivation and sale of marijuana on tribal lands, even in states where such activity is prohibited.As you can see, this was a huge year for the movement to end marijuana prohibition in the U.S.I predict 2015 will also be a big year, with state legislatures like Delaware, Illinois, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island passing various reform measures. And 2016 will be the best year ever, with five or more states (including California) legalizing marijuana at the ballot box on Election Day."

(Photo by Cem Ozdel/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae04362200003401dad8f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Thursday against a school district that serves children in Ferguson, Missouri, claiming that the election process for the district’s school board puts local black voters at a disadvantage.The Ferguson-Florissant School District, located in the greater St. Louis area, uses an at-large system to elect the members of its school board. The federal lawsuit claims that this system dilutes the black vote, causing blacks to be underrepresented on the board. Seventy-seven percent of the district's students are black, but only one of the seven board members is.Ferguson and the surrounding towns have gained worldwide attention in recent months following the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, in August. After Brown was killed by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, there were widespread protests in the area and the district delayed the start of school by more than a week. In November, after it was announced that a grand jury would not indict Wilson for Brown's death, the district again canceled classes in the face of renewed protests.The ACLU lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Missouri NAACP and the district's black residents, according to an ACLU press release. The complaint charges that the at-large voting system violates the Voting Rights Act, as it “impermissibly denies African-American voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” While more than three-fourths of the district's students are black, the area's voting-age population is majority-white. The ACLU suit contends that the district's at-large system results in the black vote getting drowned out. It calls for a new system where the district is broken down into sub-regions, each of which would elect one person to the district school board. “Elected officials in the Ferguson-Florissant School District have not been responsive to the particularized needs of the African-American community,"" the complaint reads. ""For example, the Board has been insufficiently attentive to issues of educational equity facing African-American students in the District.""When asked for comment about the lawsuit, a spokesperson for the district told The Huffington Post: “The Ferguson-Florissant School District is reviewing the lawsuit filed today by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). We hope to issue a statement in the near future.”The district was created in 1975 through a desegregation order, and encompasses a number of neighborhoods by design. Still, decades later, the district remains effectively segregated. The ACLU complaint also addresses recent protests in the area, and what it identifies as extreme, militarized police measures.“There is also a significant lack of responsiveness to the needs of the African-American community on the part of other local government officials,” it says. “These protests were triggered by a number of events following the shooting that signaled local officials’ disregard for the needs of Ferguson’s African-American residents, including the police department’s initial refusal and delay in releasing the name of the shooting officer; and the police department’s excessive response to peaceful protesters, including the use of tear gas, armored vehicles, assault rifles, and military uniforms.” "

If they had their way, Cuba's people would remain imprisoned by U.S. sanctions for another half century, long after the Castro brothers are gone. These are the same critics who continue to refer to China as ""Red China"", would like to ensure that a new Cold War endures with Russia, and would be very pleased if the U.S. were to bomb Iran. They just don't get it. The Cold War as they've known it and would like to see it has been gone for more than 20 years. More to the point, if the U.S. doesn't think more strategically about its foreign policy, as Obama has in this case, it risks making itself a relic of the Cold War on the global chess board.The crafting of U.S. foreign policy today is not simply based on partisanship, but a most noteworthy divide between those law makers whose frame of reference is stuck in the Eisenhower era, and those who recognize and embrace the ongoing transformation of our multipolar world. It makes no sense to continue to think of the world as unipolar and of the U.S. as a white knight, yet there is a strong contingent of voters and representatives in Congress who also believe Ozzie and Harriet still exist and there really is a pony sitting at the bottom of that pile of manure. What planet are they living on?If you ask me, Obama's action on Cuba was a master stroke, and full of foresight. Given that negotiations have been ongoing for more than a year to make this happen, Obama preceded Russia's annexation of Crimea. In doing so, he has undercut Putin's ability to use Cuba as a pressure point against the U.S. going forward and has, in a single action, transformed a net negative for the U.S. and Cuba into a net positive for its government, people, and businesses. The next step will be for Cuba's people to force change on the Castro government - and that will come. The Castros know that, ultimately, political change will be the price of admission to this soiree, and I believe that is a price they are willing to pay. If not, they never would have permitted this to happen.The message Obama is sending to the world is that he is not afraid to act boldly in his final two years in office, and he wishes to leave a meaningful foreign policy legacy in place. He has his work cut out for him, as his legacy is not going to be a good one in Syria or Iraq, and much of the Middle East will harbor resentment toward the U.S. for its actions over the past dozen years for a generation to come. Relations with Russia will likely remain frosty for as long as Putin remains power. But there are some significant opportunities to be seized with China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and a host of other countries in the process of enacting meaningful change.The larger message, however, is that America has an important choice to make in its next electoral cycle. It can embrace politicians who have a passport, have traveled throughout and know something about the world, speak intelligently about foreign policy and have some strategic vision, or it can embrace simple minded, uni-dimensional representatives who speak to their electorate and the American people like school children, and cast votes based on a terribly outdated view of the world. Only the latter would believe that it is not in America's interest to move forward in places like Cuba, and that, in the long-term, both countries will be better off.Daniel Wagner is CEO of Country Risk Solutions and author of the book ""Managing Country Risk""."

(Photo by Ali Atmaca/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc142a72400004f0024fa0f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BURSA, Turkey -- When 15-year-old Tambi Asaad Cimuk walked into a music store in this northwestern Turkish city last year, he had never played the piano before. Now, the shy Syrian refugee from Damascus is set to perform at Carnegie Hall next month. His teachers say he could be the next Rachmaninoff. Dubbed a child prodigy by Turkish media, Tambi, now 16, made headlines earlier this month when Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan personally granted Turkish citizenship to the Cimuk family of four. Most Syrian refugees in Turkey, who now number roughly 1.5 million, can’t even get a work permit. The Cimuk family had applied for the citizenship a month before, but the process is usually long, and rarely ends in success for refugees.But on Dec. 8, Tambi got a presidential phone call that changed his life. Before then, it had been nearly impossible for him to use his Syrian papers to travel internationally for music competitions. But Tambi’s Turkish teachers rallied together, heading a media campaign to call attention to what they say is extraordinary talent. Tambi Asaad Cimuk plays the piano in a video uploaded to YouTube by Rustem Avci, Tambi's manager.Erdogan’s phone call came just in time. Less than two days later, Tambi boarded a flight to Russia to attend an international music competition alongside pianists who have been playing for over a decade.The teenager, who left everything behind in Syria when his family fled to Turkey two years ago, says he hopes his music will somehow help foster peace. “Art shouldn’t have teams,” he said, sitting in his living room with his family. “It’s a simple message from the piano.” Tambi says he tries not to watch too much news about what’s happening in Syria. The war, now in its fourth year, is just too overwhelming. He has little stomach for talk of the politics that divides the country he left behind. What started as a series of peaceful protests against the Syrian regime in 2011 has delved into bloody civil war, uprooting millions and claiming the lives of over 200,000 people, according to some counts. But Tambi finds solace in his music. Teenage pianist Tambi Asaad Cimuk poses during an interview in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he attended a music contest on Dec. 12.“I’m expecting a Rachmaninoff out of him,” said Rustem Avci, Tambi's manager and the owner of Akademix, the private music school in Bursa where Tambi takes classes. He jests that he would have had to smuggle Tambi to Russia if he had not received Turkish citizenship. While Avci says the Turkish government giving his student citizenship might just be a good PR stunt, it makes it no less life-altering for his student. Avci and his colleagues have been Tambi’s biggest supporters, securing a full scholarship for him at a private Turkish high school and paying for his normally expensive piano lessons as soon as they realized his level of talent. But they aren't the only ones who have eyes on Tambi's future. “In 16 months, to come to this level -- it’s absolutely unbelievable,” Tamara Poddubnaya, a Georgian pianist and piano teacher at the Long Island Conservatory of Music, told The WorldPost by phone from New York. “If he continues like this, he can become a serious musician,” she continued. “He’s on the right track.”Poddubnaya first met Tambi in May when she chaired a jury at a national music competition in Istanbul. One of Tambi’s teachers introduced him to Poddubnaya. She was drawn to his dedication and what she says is “amazing potential.” Now Tambi will be spending part of next summer at the intensive international piano festival ""Music Without Borders"" in Bethel, Maine, where Poddubnaya serves as the artistic director. With his new and unexpected stardom, Tambi says his Facebook inbox is full of messages from strangers -- mostly Syrians, Turks and Circassians -- saying how proud they are and congratulating him. Tambi says that despite the overwhelming support, he fears some people might not approve of his citizenship because he’s Syrian. After all, he explains, there are plenty of talented people out there. “I’m a very lucky boy,” he says, shaking his head in disbelief. “There are so many people who want to be in my place right now.” But Tambi also feels real pressure -- it’s not every day the president tells you, “You have to work harder now,” as Erdogan told him during the phone call.“I must make Turkey proud,” Tambi says. “I must practice more and more. It’s a big responsibility.”  Tambi Asaad Cimuk excitedly pulls up a photo on his phone on Dec. 16 of Carnegie Hall, where he will be playing piano in January as part of a youth music competition. Before Syria’s war, the Cimuk family frequently traveled to Turkey, where Tambi often played the accordion at festivals celebrating Circassians, the minority group to which his family belongs. Kicked out of the North Caucasus in the 1800s when the Russians violently took over and allegedly massacred scores of the ethnic group (which Russia denies), the Circassians fled en masse. Predominantly Sunni Muslim, many are scattered across what is now Turkey, Israel, Syria and Jordan. When the Cimuk family formally received Turkish citizenship, they changed their surname from Asaad to Cimuk; it was their original Circassian last name, which they say they couldn't keep when their relatives fled to Syria generations ago. Tambi says that he misses Syria -- it’s the only home he’s ever known -- but he always felt like a bit of an outsider there as a Circassian. He’s proud and humbled to officially belong to Turkey now, he says, but he’s not one for labels. When he plays music by Russian composers, he says, he feels like he belongs to them. Tambi sits down at a keyboard in his living room, his slippered feet gently pressing on the foot pedals. For a few minutes, he’s not nervous. He’s fearless, and lost in the music.Friday, Tambi will play piano in southeast Turkey at a government-sponsored symposium on peace in the Middle East. Former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen is set to be there, as well as Turkish and foreign academics and experts. When he takes the stage, he hopes people will see him solely as a person playing a message of peace. “I will likely play Chopin, because it’s romantic,” he explains with a smile. “Mozart, because it’s about happiness, and Rachmaninoff …” he pauses, searching for the right words, then laughs, adding, “for the sake of insanity!” While the government has taken a special interest in Tambi, he says he still needs financial aid to further his musical education. He’s hoping to land a scholarship this summer when he attends Poddubnaya's workshop, and in a few years, when he attends university. He dreams of studying piano in the United States, where he will travel next month to play at Carnegie Hall as part of a youth music competition. His family, while more comfortable than many Syrians here in Turkey living in refugee camps or on the streets, cannot support Tambi’s gift alone. Plane tickets and music schools are expensive.“I couldn’t get my money out of the bank in Syria,” explains Tambi’s father, Nart Cimuk, a former electrician in Syria who now works at an elevator factory in Turkey with his wife, a former high school teacher.

Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) (L), talk about their efforts to retrieve U.S. contractor Alan Gross from prison in Cuba on December 17, 2014 in Washington, DC.

And the American Dream isn't what it used to be. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, December 18, 2014.RECENT SUPPORT FOR RE-ESTABLISHING CUBA RELATIONS - HuffPollster: ""Most Americans...think the U.S. should re-establish diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba, according to a poll conducted by The New York Times. The survey, conducted in October, found that 56 percent of Americans favored re-establishing ties with Cuba, while 29 percent oppose doing so. After American Alan Gross was released from a Cuban prison Wednesday, President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would start the process to normalize relations with Cuba. He also said the U.S. will ease its embargo on Cuba and called for debate to consider lifting it. Americans' overall views of Cuba in the October poll were lukewarm, with 39 percent rating the country favorably, 34 percent rating it unfavorably, and another 26 percent undecided. While Republicans were more likely than Democrats to hold a negative opinion, there was little difference between Hispanic Americans and Americans as a whole, the survey found."" [HuffPost, NYT]Similar to other recent polling - More from HuffPollster: ""A YouGov/Economist survey conducted earlier this year -- as well as four polls in April 2009, after President Barack Obama expressed openness to a thaw in relations with Cuba -- also found majority support for reopening diplomatic relationships."" [See also YouGov, Polling Report]Support for diplomatic relations up since 1990s - Aaron Blake: ""A Washington Post-ABC News poll in 2009 -- the last one that was conducted on the subject -- showed that two-thirds of Americans (66 percent) wanted to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, while 27 percent opposed doing so. And views on the matter have shifted rapidly -- about as rapidly as anything in politics, in fact. In 1998, Americans opposed setting up diplomatic relations, 56 percent to 38 percent. Since then, they have gradually and steadily embraced more open relations. People are somewhat less keen on the idea of ending the trade embargo and opening travel to Cuba -- two other major issues at hand as the two countries engage in talks. But both still had majority support [in 2009]; 57 percent wanted to end the embargo, while 55 percent wanted to end travel restrictions."" [WashPost]Support also high among Latinos, in Florida - A poll commissioned in early 2014 by the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council: ""For decades the rhetoric around changing Cuba policy has been that Florida would never let it happen. The results from this poll challenge that long-held belief by putting Florida 7 percentage points ahead of the nation in favoring normalization. Not only are Floridians more willing than a supportive nation for change, but [Floridians] favor strongly favor normalization by 8 percentage points more than the country as a whole. Latinos share near identical levels of support. Floridians and Latinos are more likely to be well-educated on the issue of the US-Cuba relationship because of geographic and personal ties. The numbers indicate that the closer people are to the issue, the more likely they are to favor changing policy."" The poll was conducted by the bipartisan team of pollsters Paul Maslin (D) and Glen Bolger (R). On Wednesday, the Atlantic Council expressed support for engagement with Cuba. [Atlantic Council, full report, statement on policy change]South Florida Cubans divided on embargo - Harry Enten: ""Opinions on U.S.-Cuban relations have changed vastly in the past 15 years. The Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University has been polling Cuban-Americans living in South Florida since 1991. On the embargo question, Cuban-Americans had favored maintaining or strengthening it; today, a slight majority oppose it. Only 48 percent favor the embargo. That compares with 87 percent when the question was first asked 23 years ago and 62 percent in 2000."" [538]Cuban vote has shifted to Democrats - Philip Bump: ""When we talk about the politics of Cuba, we're talking about one thing: Florida...Florida is home to three-quarters of the country's Cuban population...And as Pew Research found in June, the Cuban population in the United States has shifted to the left politically. When the organization polled in 2000, nearly two-thirds of Cubans identified as Republican, in part a function of the party's strong history of criticizing the regime of Fidel Castro. Since, that has shifted dramatically. In 2012, Obama won a majority of the Cuban-American vote in Miami. He won Cubans nationally by two points."" [WashPost]How will Florida's Cubans react? - Nate Cohn: ""It’s hard to know whether Mr. Obama’s decision will move the needle among Cuban-American voters. Polling data reflecting Mr. Obama’s decision, which will arrive in a few weeks, will tell us more....[However] Mr. Obama managed to make substantial gains among Cuban-Americans [in 2012] even though he was open to revising Cuba policy. Mr. Crist also ran on a more open Cuba policy and won the Cuban-American vote in the exit polls last month. The fact that Mr. Crist’s advisers thought it strategic to emphasize the issue may be an indication of what their polling data showed."" [NYT]AMERICANS HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM - The American Enterprise Institute's Karlyn Bowman: ""[W]hat exactly are Americans saying about the dream and how have their views of it changed over time? Do Americans believe the dream is endangered? The answers are more complicated than one might think…. Americans, by and large, believe that they can achieve their own personal version of the dream. This view has changed little over the past 30 years....Our review also suggests that people always say the challenges for the next generation will be greater than the ones they have faced….It is the public’s collective judgment about the American Dream that has undergone worrying changes. We put more weight on what people say about their own experiences, but what people think about the average American’s experiences drives our political conversation. And here, as a result of the 2008 financial crash and its aftermath, pessimism about the present and the future is palpable."" [AEI]Belief in the American dream as a whole at a low ebb - Andrew Ross Sorkin and Megan Thee-Brenan: ""Despite an improving economy and jobs picture, the public is more pessimistic than it was after the 2008 financial crisis that it is possible to work hard and become rich, according to a New York Times poll. The poll, which explored Americans’ opinions on a wide range of economic and financial issues, found that only 64 percent of respondents said they still believed in the American dream, the lowest result in roughly two decades. Even near the depth of the financial crisis in early 2009, 72 percent of Americans still believed that hard work could result in riches….Notwithstanding the bleaker view of upward mobility, the majority of those polled said they were more concerned about the possibility that too much regulation in Washington could stymie the economy than they were about the prospect of inequality.""

Gen. James L.

Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told The Wall Street Journal that three important figures in the group had been killed in recent U.S. strikes in Iraq -- two of them between Dec. 3 and Dec. 9.“These are high-value targets, senior leadership,"" Dempsey told the Journal, adding that their loss would impair planning by the group.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Daesh, is led by a self-appointed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Reports in early November suggested that al-Baghdadi may have been killed in the ongoing airstrike campaign by the U.S. and its allies in Iraq, but officials made clear that he is not among the ISIS leaders they know to be dead.The senior leaders killed in early December were Baghdadi's deputy, Haji Mutazz, and Islamic State's military commander in Iraq, Abd al-Basit, U.S. officials said. A mid-level leader, Radwin Talib, was killed in late November, they added.Talib had been the governor of Mosul, the key Iraqi city that Islamic State captured in June in its biggest victory to date. Mosul residents had suggested to Reuters in November that Talib had been killed, but this is the first U.S. confirmation.Gary Boucher, a spokesman for the Pentagon joint task force that runs daily U.S. military operations against ISIS, told The Huffington Post in an email that the killing of the militant leaders helped protect U.S. partners on the ground.""The loss of these key leaders degrades [the group's] ability to command and control current operations against Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), including Kurdish and other local forces in Iraq,"" Boucher wrote. He added that how to inflict the most damage on ISIS leadership is ""always part of our targeting calculus.""Max Abrahms, a professor at Northeastern University who has done research on so-called decapitation strikes targeting the leadership of terrorist groups, said the U.S. success in killing Islamic State leaders may have important consequences for how the group is run.It may empower lower-level militants who are less strategic in their thinking, Abrahms said, and therefore cause even more indiscriminate violence. He added that such strikes tend to boost tensions within militant groups, as fighters begin to suspect one another of having provided intelligence to the enemy and engage in struggles to fill high-ranking vacancies.The news may also signal progress at a more subtle level.""It suggests that the U.S. has developed intelligence that allows it to identify and target central figures in the organization,"" said Barak Mendelsohn, a researcher on Islamist groups who teaches at Haverford College, in an email to HuffPost. Intelligence analysts have previously warned that they have a worryingly limited capacity to monitor developments in the ISIS fight because U.S. personnel are not on the battlefields where the group is being targeted. The revelations about the deaths of ISIS leaders came amid other good news from the region. The military chief of the U.S. campaign said Thursday that airstrikes by the coalition against the Islamic State had provided Kurdish forces the support they needed to recapture significant ground from the militants. But the commander, Lt. Gen. James Terry, warned that Iraqi forces would need at least three more years of U.S. training to be a credible fighting force. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Wednesday signed orders sending hundreds more U.S. military advisers into Iraq, following Obama's announcement that he would boost the maximum number of U.S. troops that may be stationed there to 3,100.

She didn't forget part of herself, she just chose not to present it to the world. I am fascinated by her success in transforming the world while hiding part of herself.",2014-12-18,"FILE - This undated photo released by NASA shows astronaut Sally Ride. Ride, the first American woman in space, died Monday, July 23, 2012. She was 61. (AP Photo/NASA, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5ff5a260000300182de64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I stayed up until 4 a.m. last night reading Lynn Sherr's biography, Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, an unwise choice, given my schedule for today. Now, I'm sitting on my flight home to Seattle from NYC, where I just finished it, sniffling quietly, hoping my seatmate doesn't notice my tears. After I read the last page, I spent several minutes flipping through the photographs in the center of the book, staring at the various renditions of this famous woman, pictured from infancy into her fifties, then rereading snippets of pages, marveling at her complexity and wondering at the price she paid for the choices she made.It's an amazing story of a remarkable woman. I am crying again as I type. I don't really know why, though. Yes, Sally Ride inspired me. Purposeful, poised, fantastically competent, wildly successful, all that is true. Beyond being the first American woman astronaut to launch into outer space, she advised Presidents, served on national commissions, founded a social enterprise (Sally Ride Science). But at heart, she was a scientist who loved sharing her passion for physics and learning, asking questions and seeking answers. She not only showed what women are capable of doing in an era far different than today and paved the way for others to follow her, but she helped widen the road for all girls to imagine themselves doing anything they set their sights on. Not merely an advocate for expanding girls' access to science and improving science education for everyone, Sally Ride created innovative and engaging learning opportunities that reached millions of girls in their critical learning years and altered their self-perceptions and their futures. Countless girls not only discovered science, but developed their own lifelong passions for delving deep into the universe's many mysteries.The litany of Sally Ride's accomplishments is impressive, but it was her authenticity that really struck me. That's an odd thing to say, because she hid the fact that her life partner for 27 long years, way back to 1985, was a woman. She never mentioned that fact in public, and only on extremely rare occasions did she acknowledge this most intimate and important of relationships to her friends. In fact, she even lied outright on occasion to keep her secret. Of course people in her inner circle knew, but they followed her silent lead, in collusion to keep not just her image pristine, but her ability to impact others' futures intact. What did that cost her, I wonder? I fell in love with a woman for the first time in 1982. A year later, unable to align the mismatch between my public face and my private passion, I unceremoniously dumped my girlfriend. I hated myself for doing it, but I hated myself more for feeling like a fake and a liar. The risk of losing the respect and love of people important to me was simply too steep. So, I sacrificed a core part of myself, and kept it underground. So deeply did I bury this part of myself that I got married 18 months later, created a family with my husband that grew to include three children and simply forgot that I might be gay. But can one forget something so essential about oneself?Sally Ride led a bifurcated life too. She didn't forget part of herself, she just chose not to present it to the world. I am fascinated by her success in transforming the world while hiding part of herself. She was hyper-aware that her success would determine the extent of opportunities for the women who came after her. That was a responsibility she both welcomed and respected. And clearly, a pragmatist to the core who faced the facts despite the potentially high emotional cost of doing so, she was determined to succeed, as much for herself as for the future.I understand Sally Ride's decision to remain in the closet. In seeking to change the world's outlook in important ways, she rightly sensed that public awareness of her sexuality would only hurt her ability to fulfill her highest purpose. Painful to admit, but she would have accomplished far less. Sally was deeply wedded to generating social change, and I can only admire her willingness to keep that goal front and center. Courageous and authentic, she lived her life to accomplish what she saw as most important.Looking from afar, I'd guess Sally was satisfied with the life she led. She reached for the stars and got damn close. She didn't stop to ponder the trade-offs, she just did what the job required. Her longtime partner, Tam O'Shaughnessy, Ph.D. maintains that Sally was an optimist, always looking forward, not one to regret or resent past events, although she also consistently avoided delving deeply into her feelings. That approach makes sense. Keeping focused on the public good likely gave Sally Ride enough sustenance to justify her secret-keeping. I'm only sorry she wasn't able to live long enough to realize the progress of American culture and relax the rigid boundary between her public image and her full identity. Now I know why I'm crying; because Sally gave up so much to give us so much."
