Credit Star Shooter / MediaPunch/IPX",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fd8d2600002d0182dd8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s hard to imagine anyone wanting to trade places with Monica Lewinsky. Not only is she destined to be remembered in textbooks as the “other woman” in one of America’s most infamous sex scandals (culminating in the first presidential impeachment since Reconstruction), but she continues to be a cheap and popular punchline in the contemporary zeitgeist. A decade-and-a-half may have passed since her name was a staple in headline news and talk-show monologues, but “Lewinsky” is still synonymous with everything from soapy political melodrama in general to the specific sex act she performed on President Bill Clinton.Viewed from this perspective, it’s hardly surprising that she eventually returned to the spotlight in an attempt to revise her public identity. More striking is the fact that her recent speech at Forbes’ “30 Under 30 Summit” not only offered valuable insights about her role in America, but by extension drew attention to how the Internet has fundamentally changed our culture. Even as political punditsspeculate as to her potential effect on Hillary Clinton’s probable presidential campaign or debate whether she should be chiefly remembered as a victim or villain (all of which, it must be emphasized, are valid questions) we shouldn’t overlook the universal lesson Americans can pick up from both Lewinsky’s legacy.Read more on The Daily Dot"

Shaky claims about Medicare were common in the 2012 campaign, from President Barack Obama on down. Now theyâve surfaced in this yearâs midterm elections, in one of the hottest Senate races in the country. McConnell responded Wednesday with an ad giving a dire spin to Medicare cuts set in motion by Obamaâs health care law, a familiar claim from the 2012 GOP playbook. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dadd2500008b013a55a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If Republicans take the Senate next month (and if he wins his own reelection race), Mitch McConnell will be that body's next Majority Leader. Then what happens?McConnell's been frank about what the GOP would do with the Senate -- at least when he thinks nobody's listening. This quote comes from audio, obtained by Undercurrent's Lauren Windsor, of a talk McConnell gave to a Koch Brothers group in August:""Most things in the Senate require 60 (votes) ... but not the budget. So in the House and Senate, we own the budget. What does that mean?McConnell attacked the Dodd/Frank financial reform bill in further audio obtained by this week by Windsor, calling it ""Obamacare for banks.""McConnell said he would ""definitely"" defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, calling it ""the biggest part of the Dodd/Frank bill.""But then, that's been his position all along. Senate Republicans refused to accept anyone's nomination to lead the CFPB when it was formed. Said McConnell at the time: ""We're simply not going to ... confirm him or anybody else to this agency that shouldn't exist in its current form.""Last year McConnell remarked, ""If I had my way, we wouldn't have the [CFPB] at all.""The course of action McConnell lays out in these audio clips would:1. Expose Americans to toxic threats, and make additional disasters like the BP oil spill more likely.Cuts in EPA funding are intended to meet the GOP's stated goal of deregulating high-polluting industries like those of the Koch brothers themselves. That would lead to more fracking, more poisons in the groundwater, a higher risk of water-supply crises like the one recently experienced in West Virginia, increased air pollution...The result? A sicker population which is at greater risk of environmental disaster.2. Deprive millions of American of health insurance.The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. But it has extended health insurance to millions of Americans, both through the exchanges and through Medicaid extensions at the state level (excepting those states where Republican governors have refused to accept Federal funds for that purpose).Denying funding for the law would, in all likelihood, close down the exchanges and end the Medicaid program. That would lead to thousands of additional deaths like that of Charlene Dill, a young working mother in Florida. (We discussed her death and related topics with Rep. Alan Grayson here).In addition, millions of Americans would lose their exchange-based health insurance under a Republican Senate, including people who have pre-existing conditions or are under 26 years old.3. Ensure that money that financial institutions obtain dishonestly -- money like the $4.6 billion the CFPB has already returned to consumers -- would remain in the banks' pockets from now on.The CFPB reports that it arranged the return of $4.6 billion in improperly obtained fees in its first three years of operation. The money was distributed to 15 million customers. In addition, more than three quarters of a million customers will receive remediation from financial institutions (that is, they'll be made whole) as a result of the CFPB's actions.These actions will stop under a McConnell-led Senate, according to the senator himself.4. Give a green light for credit-card companies to resume the ""deceptive marketing practices"" and other abuses that the CFPB has red-flagged.In its very first enforcement action the CFPB ordered giant credit-card company Capitol One to repay $150 million to ripped-off customers, as well as $60 million to regulators, after the CFPB and another agency identified dishonest marketing practices that resulted in people being saddled with costly and ineffective add-on services they didn't want or need.Since then a total of three major credit card companies (American Express and Discover are the others) have returned a total of $425 million. Interventions like this would end under a GOP Senate, according to McConnell, and credit-card companies would be free to resume their past deceptive practices.5. Make credit-card agreements and mortgage documents harder to understand.The CFPB's rule require credit-card companies and mortgage lenders to write their agreements in plain English. That will end if McConnell has his way.The end result? Mortgage agreements that are impossible to understand, with provisions that could lead to foreclosure and/or prove financially ruinous to borrowers.6. Make it harder to shop for student loans.Defunding the CFPB would put an end to rules which make it easier for students and their families to comparison-shop for student loans.The student-loan ombudsman's office, which reviews complaints about student loans, would also be shut down.7. Decrease oversight of credit bureaus.That would mean, among other things, that it would become harder for you to obtain your own credit report or correct misinformation on your credit record.8. Close down the CFPB complaint database.Consumers can now complain to the CFPB whenever they feel they have been cheated, abused, or misled by financial institutions. The CFPB tracks these complaints and intervenes with lenders where appropriate to resolve problems.That would end, according to McConnell, under a Republican Senate.9. Increase racial discrimination in auto loans.The CFPB has been active in monitoring racial discrimination in auto lending, through its review of the business practice of the ""indirect lenders"" who underwrite these loans. That would stop.The remediation which has occurred under this program would also end if the Republican Senate and House act as McConnell indicates they would.10. Protect ""too big to fail"" banks.Although Mitch McConnell claims otherwise, defunding Dodd/Frank would be a boon for too-big-to-fail banks. While he claims the law benefits them, the evidence suggests otherwise. As Mike Konczal observes in The New Republic, banks would pursue that designation if it were advantageous to them. Instead they're making every effort to avoid the label.11. Help shady derivatives dealers While more needs to be done, the Dodd/Frank law was a definite improvement over the status quo. Konczal also offers a good overview of its other useful features, most of which would cease to exist if McConnell and the Republicans make good on their threats.12. Allow more sneaky dealing in mortgagesIn Undercurrent's audio clips, McConnell seems to suggest that mortgage lenders didn't contribute to the 2008 financial crisis. This is nonsense. Fraud and excessive risk-taking were endemic throughout the mortgage financing system, from the underwriting of new loans to the bundling and selling of mortgages to third parties. That epidemic of fraud and risk-taking was central to the financial crisis, and to a massive loss of wealth for the American majority.Americans were persuaded to take out loans without understanding their provisions, based on deceitful projections of their homes' future worth. Investors were deceived, too, as banks knowingly and deceptively bundled and sold junk-value mortgages as high-grade investments (with the collusion of the ratings ""agencies"").""I have a friend who runs a mortgage business,"" McConnell says on the audio recording, ""and he says the cost of writing a mortgage has gone up $1000 for him.""Underwriting a mortgage clearly takes more time and effort that generating reams of ""liars' loans."" Businesses would not rather bother, especially when it's more lucrative to cut corners. That's why they support politicians like Mitch McConnell -- and why the rest of shouldn't."

Now it has its sights set on the entire fast-food industry, starting with the giant of giants, the McDonald's Corp.

Eva was in fact presenting this year's Clinton Global Citizens Award to these two gentlemen, co-Founders of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a workers' rights group based in southern Florida's tomato growing region. The CIW have spent over 20 years battling issues from the rampant sexual harassment of female farmworkers to modern-day slavery in the fields. Along the way, they developed a remarkable program that binds every player in the tomato supply chain to a Code of Conduct that ensures the fair treatment of workers. This Fair Food Program is revolutionary and has turned the fields of southern Florida from ""ground zero for modern-day slavery"" to a place with no forced labor. As producer of my upcoming documentary, Food Chains, Eva continued her remarks by asking ""in an age where there is so much interest in food -- everyone seems to be soy-free or gluten-free -- why is there still very little interest in the hands that pick that food?""This year's Food Day is dedicated to addressing that question. Nearly all of the produce we eat in the United States is handpicked. Machines don't harvest our fresh lettuce, peaches, cherries, carrots, etc. People do. And as one can imagine, that work is difficult.For her 2011 book, The American Way of Eating, author Tracie McMillan spent three weeks in America's garlic capital, Gilroy, California, shuffling on her knees, yanking, clipping and trimming garlic roots. She developed tennis elbow, had horrific bruises on her thighs which she used to steady the large pruning shears, and, since farmworkers are usually paid by the piece, earned a grand-total of $21 for her day's work. ""My thighs look as though they've been attacked by an enraged but weaponless toddler,"" she writes.""My hands, swollen and inundated with blisters the first few days, have acclimatized, but there's a worrisome pain shooting up my right arm,"" she continued.The CIW's Fair Food Program not only addresses the treatment of workers, but helps to ensure they're paid a fair wage. Large buyers of tomatoes like Whole Foods, McDonald's and Walmart each pay an extra penny per pound for their Florida tomatoes. That penny is passed on to workers as a bonus -- in some cases, doubling their wages. After three years of implementing their code of conduct and wage program, the CIW and participating growers are ready to launch a consumer-facing label that will help those who have interest in the hands that pick their food to know that at least their tomatoes were humanely harvested. So on Food Day, look for the CIW's new Fair Food Label in participating Whole Foods stores, and demand that retailers like Wendy's and Publix, which have not signed the Fair Food Program, do so."

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3150f3c000018010c4899.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Madrid, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Last year Madrid's city and regional governments sold almost 5,000 rent-controlled flats to private equity investors including Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. At the time, the tenants were told their rental conditions would remain the same.But as old contracts expire, dozens of people have received demands for higher rent, been told their rents will increase dramatically, been threatened with eviction or moved out to escape the insecurity. Thousands of Spain's poor now depend for their homes on the generosity of private equity.Jamila Bouzelmat is one of them.The mother of six lives in a four-bedroom flat on the outskirts of the Spanish capital that was bought jointly by Goldman and a Spanish firm. The 44-year-old said that until March her family paid 58 euros ($73) a month in rent out of her husband's 500-euro unemployment benefit. In April, her bank statement shows, her new landlords suddenly took 436 euros from her bank account.She discovered the payment when she tried to pay an electricity bill.""We went to take money out and there wasn't a cent left in the bank,"" she said, her 18-month-old daughter playing at her feet. She got charity hand-outs to feed her children, aged between 18 months and 19 years, and now lives in fear of the rent bill. Goldman declined to comment.In the buildings sold to the funds, Reuters has spoken to more than 40 households who face similar difficulties. They include some of Madrid's most vulnerable people: an unemployed single mother of five with a severely disabled daughter, for example, and an HIV patient with one lung. Both faced evictions that were temporarily halted at the last minute.There is no suggestion the buyers have acted illegally. Having bought around 15 percent of Madrid's publicly held social housing, the new owners are simply exercising their right to charge commercial rents once reduced rents that tenants have paid expire.However, Socialist councilors in Madrid have launched lawsuits directed at the state bodies that sold the rent-controlled homes, and tenants meet weekly to organize street protests. Evictions ordered and postponed by the new owners are an increasingly common sight in Spain's media.The ructions in Madrid come as Spain tries to recover from its historic property-market collapse and deep economic crisis. Between 2007 and 2013, Spanish property prices fell by nearly 40 percent. More than 3 million houses and apartments sit empty, according to official figures. Spain has one of the smallest stocks of social housing in Europe, but as Madrid's authorities cut their budgets, they have sold what they can at fire-sale prices.For the private equity firms that bought the flats, the deal was good business. For tenants, less so. The poorest had long benefited from rent reductions - some of them officially documented contracts, others informal arrangements with well-meaning public officials.Of the homes Goldman bought, around 400 benefited from official rent reductions, according to one government source. Such cuts were agreed individually for up to two years, and some tenants used to pay less than 20 percent of the going rate. The informal deals are hard to count.The apartments were sold by two government agencies. One of them, the Madrid city housing body, told Reuters the sales were crucial to paying its debt, but did not answer questions on the number of tenants affected or their situation.The other, the regional housing body known as IVIMA, sold its flats to Goldman Sachs International and Azora, a Spanish private equity firm which invests in rental accommodation. Azora set up a management firm, Encasa Cibeles, to manage the flats, and both Goldman and Azora referred inquiries to Encasa Cibeles.In the case of Bouzelmat, whose rental agreement ended in March, an Encasa Cibeles spokesman declined to comment on ""processes and methods of payment."" But he said Bouzelmat had been paying by direct debit. The company said it respects all ongoing contracts, including rent reductions, and once these expire, reviews each tenant case-by-case. ""Evictions occur in an extremely small number of cases,"" the spokesman said: ""Our priority is to help those in need and we are doing this with a team of social workers looking to help the most vulnerable.""Pablo Sola, a spokesman for IVIMA, said the deal had been exemplary and IVIMA meets Encasa Cibeles every week to ensure ""no family that wants to pay"" is evicted. ""The Madrid government has not washed its hands of the management of these flats. We are following up the process to avoid the eviction of any family in financial difficulty.""The public-sector real estate workout is creating winners and losers. Spain needs new investment to put a floor under its property market - a necessary condition for a broader recovery - and at the same time its social safety net needs funds. Economist Miguel Hernandez said foreign investors play an important role by providing cash to public institutions.""These funds may appear to be acting like vultures, but they are also helping the system, because the administrations had very few options to get the cash they needed,"" said Hernandez, professor at IE Business School.""A GOOD PRICE""The red-brick development where Bouzelmat lives is in Vallecas, a working-class area in the south of Madrid. Thousands of new flats - many of them state-owned social housing - were built there during Spain's property boom in the early 2000s.When boom turned to bust in 2008, Spain's budget for housing collapsed. It was 1.4 billion euros in 2008 and is now 800 million. That left local governments scrambling to cut costs, and eyeing privatizations. To lure foreign investors, Madrid overhauled rental laws, making it easier for landlords to evict non-paying tenants. It worked: Investment in Spanish real estate increased 12-fold last year to 5.2 billion euros.A confidential May 2013 report - commissioned by Madrid city council and prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers - found that the city's housing unit, known as EMVS, was unsustainable. EMVS, set up over 30 years ago to house the poor and disadvantaged, had higher debt repayments than its cash income. PWC's report advised Madrid to sell some flats immediately.In July 2013, the city sold 1,860 properties to a fund jointly owned by Blackstone and Spanish fund Magic Real Estate. The average price per apartment was around 67,200 euros.EMVS said the sales were crucial to paying down its debt. Opposition United Left councilor Angel Perez said it was an outrage. ""You are playing with people's lives,"" he told an angry town hall session at the time. Blackstone declined to comment. Magic Real Estate did not respond.Within weeks of the Madrid City Council's sale, IVIMA, the regional housing body, sold another 2,935 apartments - including Bouzelmat's - to Goldman Sachs and Azora for roughly 68,500 euros per unit.Taking an average size of around 70 square meters for the flats sold, Goldman and Blackstone and their Spanish partners paid around 970 euros per sq m for the properties. Flats in Vallecas sell for around 2,000 euros per sq m, real estate agent websites show - about 200,000 euros for a 100-sq-km home. ""The price per unit was very cheap,"" said Fernando Encinar of Madrid-based real estate agent Idealista. ""In any market, if you buy in volume you get a good price.""""TAKE NO ACTION""Last October, Pablo Cavero, Madrid councilor for transport, infrastructure and housing, told a council session that the only change for the IVIMA tenants would be ""the name at the top of the rent bill,"" the minutes show. He declined to be interviewed.That month, tenants in Bouzelmat's block, some of whom had official rent reductions, received a letter from Encasa Cibeles saying: ""The rental contract will not suffer any change. You will maintain the same rental conditions that you have currently, including the monthly rent and the length of your contract."" The letter, seen by Reuters, said tenants needn't do anything.It did not mention what would happen after the contracts ended, nor did it refer to reduced rents. These were separate arrangements that each tenant made with their state landlord. For instance, if a tenant lost their job, they would submit documentation and IVIMA would grant a discretionary reduction for a fixed period, documents seen by Reuters show. Of the 20,000 homes IVIMA now owns, around 27 percent have a formal rent reduction of between 5 percent and 95 percent, a source close to IVIMA said.Late last year, Encasa Cibeles invited four tenants' representatives from Bouzelmat's block to a meeting. The company told them rent reductions would not be renewed once contracts expired. ""Encasa Cibeles told us they would respect reductions until the contract ended but then it would return to the base rate, because they were not a charity,"" said Saida Juarez, the tenant representative from the block.""FULL PAYMENT""Unemployed hairdresser and mother-of-three Yasmin Rubiano lives in a flat now owned by Goldman and Azora. Rubiano said she stopped getting a printed rent bill once her reduced rent of 50 euros per month ended in December, but got no word from the new owners.In January she started to receive monthly text messages from her bank, which she showed a reporter, advising that it had received a demand for 498.18 euros. She has been paying 100 euros a month to show goodwill, but cannot pay more. In March, Rubiano said, she received a letter from Encasa Cibeles demanding full payment or threatening legal action.The Encasa Cibeles spokesman said it had nothing to do with the text messages. Social workers have been working for some time to find the best solution for the family, who still live in the flat, he added. ""Encasa Cibeles has not started any legal action against them.""The situation with Blackstone and Magic Real Estate is slightly different. Their tenants generally have longer contracts and fewer formal deals for reduced rents, though most pay below market rates. As with the Goldman flats, tenants were told nothing would change: ""The contracts ... are guaranteed,"" seller EMVS said in a July news release. ""The only thing that will change in the rent statement is the issuer.""As leases near expiry, at least 20 tenants in one block have signed new contracts for sharp rent rises, said a source with knowledge of the matter.When Blackstone and Magic Real Estate bought the flats, Jaime Gamarra, an unemployed 62-year-old receiving benefits of less than 400 euros a month, had not been paying full rent for around a year. After he lost both his jobs, a woman at the council had told him to pay what he could afford.On March 12, he got a letter from the new management company, Fidere, saying he owed them 5,133.54 euros in ""inherent obligations"" to be paid by March 5.""I started to panic,"" he said. He met Fidere and was told his arrangement with the council was not viable for the firm. On June 24 he got a letter of eviction. A judge overruled this in September, but Fidere can appeal. Gamarra fears he will be thrown out.""These flats were built with public money for people in difficulty,"" Gamarra said.Jorge Arriba, a 37-year-old car mechanic, lives in a Blackstone flat; his 10-year contract ended in August. He used to pay 415 euros per month in rent, around a third of his salary. When he met Fidere in May, he said, they told him the rent would go up from September.On Aug. 6, the 20 tenants in Arriba's block signed new contracts with Fidere, some of them seen by Reuters, which stipulate a rise of more than 40 percent in rent over three years. Blackstone referred inquiries to Fidere.""It is not true that it is our intention to increase rent once the contracts end,"" Fidere spokesman Miguel Onate said in an email. Later, he said ""some people have lost the public subsidy they received from the council."" Of the flats under Fidere's management, he said, fewer than 2 percent have recurring problems with payments.Six sources involved in the bidding process told Reuters that bidders knew the straitened circumstances of the tenants. The funds that entered final bidding - nine in all - were given detailed information. The sale terms, seen by Reuters, show the regional government stressed that the new owners must honor all the tenants' rights and obligations.Goldman went for the Madrid homes after a successful pair of similar deals in Germany, a person familiar with the matter said. Goldman looked at the profiles of the tenants and considered whether the properties were ""under-managed from a yield perspective"" and whether new ownership could ""improve rents."" The deal was particularly appealing because 85 percent of the flats were occupied and most tenants were paying rent, in contrast to other properties with high percentages of defaulted mortgages or laws that made it hard to raise rents.Some local politicians say IVIMA acted illegally by selling the flats cheap. IVIMA Director Ana Gomendio declined to comment.Now a judge will decide who, if anyone, to blame. Any tenants evicted can reapply for social housing. Around 13,000 households are already on the waiting list for flats owned by Madrid city council, a source close to the council said. (Edited by Sara Ledwith) "

That's a quick summary of my brief and fiery career at the Washington Post. I was just 27 years old in 1973 when Bradlee hired me to write in the Style section of the newspaper. I had caught the paper's attention with a series of profiles I had written for the New York Post, then owned by Dorothy Schiff, and I was flown down to Washington for interviews. Bradlee was the last and toughest. He snarled, threw around F words and popped a trick question. ""We've been accused of racism,"" he said, referring to the Metro Seven suit filed by the paper's black reporters a year earlier. I was Haitian-born and black. ""How do you feel about working for a racist paper?"" ""If I was going to worry about who was racist, I wouldn't be in this business,"" I answered. He roared with laughter and I was aboard.I was excited to work at the Post during Watergate. Woodward and Bernstein were making new revelations every day. Style was an innovative section which gave writers lots of space to tell a story. The paper was in a state of siege with the government. John Mitchell was sending warnings to Katharine Graham that she would get ""her titty caught in a wringer."" The hostility from the White House was palpable. When I made a routine call for a list of guests at a White House dinner, the operator hung up on me. Much later, I realized I had shared in one of the bravest moments in American journalism, long before the industry lapsed into caution and a lack of skepticism about government.I was assigned to profile figures that emerged from Woodstein's investigations. I chased Egil Krogh, a Nixon operative, and a dozen others. Most of them declined. But after President Nixon fired his attorney general and Robert Bork agreed to take over, I was dispatched to Bork's home with a photographer. I told him it was his chance to tell his side of what was being called the Saturday Night Massacre. To my surprise, he let us in and explained for an hour that he had accepted the job because didn't want the government to fall into chaos. He let us take a picture of him sipping a Scotch, which he would reprimand me for decades later. The story was on the front page of Style the next day with a front-page teaser. I ran into Bradlee on the elevator. There was no congratulations -- instead: ""What are you going to do next?"" he asked.Bradlee was undoubtedly the best newsroom leader I ever worked for. He pushed you to be better, spotted the weak spots in your draft and had a nose for news. When I sent him a short wire story about two teenage black girls in Alabama who had been sterilized, I was on the next plane to Montgomery. I covered Duke Ellington's New York funeral -- after coming in at 4 a.m. to write a 5,000 word obit on deadline.I also learned it was not smart to get on his bad side. After a year at The Post, I began to understand why the black reporters had sued. The Post, with seven or eight African-American journalists, probably had more than any other major newspaper at the time. But the paper's coverage of black Washington was as bad as its national coverage was good. When the District of Columbia won the right to elect its mayor, the story in the paper included interviews with addicts and winos on one of the city's worst blocks expressing indifference. I wrote a memo pointing out that the District had one of the largest middle classes in America and that when a bill was passed that affected white people, we should get the opinions of white inmates in federal prisons.My apartment in Adams-Morgan became a meeting place for the paper's black reporters. I argued that we needed to back up our demands with facts and statistics. Some of the numbers shocked us. The usual upward path at The Post was to go from Metro to the national desk. Yet, in a period of eight years, not a single black reporter had been promoted. That prompted a memo. We analyzed the coverage of middle class blacks in the Metro pages. Memo. I was soon identified as a ringleader. When tensions became unbearable, I applied for an opening in Los Angeles. Bradlee wrote me a letter rejecting my application because I was ""gifted but a pain in the ass, and no one wants a pain in the ass."" I showed the letter to some colleagues seeking advice on how to respond. It was soon public and in Alex Cockburn's media column. I decided to resign and moved to California anyway but learned that confronting Bradlee had a cost. I was turned down for several newspaper jobs. I switched to magazines and soon re-launched my career. I would go on to work a decade at Fortune and manage several major technology magazines. Years later, I ran into Bradlee at a social event. He shook my hand warmly and said, ""We learned a lot from you."" I realized that by standing my ground, I had earned his respect. In 2009, I was approached about running The Root, a website founded by Washington Post publisher Don Graham and Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. I warned Gates I had left The Post decades earlier in something of a huff. The word came back from Washington: ""Welcome back.""Joel Dreyfuss is living in Paris and writing a book about the 300-year history of his family in Haiti."

I see it as an opportunity to unearth the worms and re-soil.,2014-10-23,"WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 08: FILE, Rabbi Barry Freundel at Kesher Israel Congregation in Georgetown is taking and making a number of calls since the announcement that one of his congregants Joe Lieberman, was just selected to be Al Gore's running mate, in Washington, DC on August 8, 2000. (Photo by Michael Lutzky/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f18e210000d601c91bd1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Up until last week, Barry Freundel was the rabbi of a large Orthodox Jewish shul in Washington D.C. He was a leader in modern Orthodox thought and an intellectual force in the Jewish world. He was on the executive board of the Rabbinical Council of America and served as an expert on conversion and ethics across the nation. Until last week, when he got caught committing acts of voyeurism in the mikva (ritual bath) -- namely using hidden cameras to film women showering before immersing in the ritual bath. After the initial revulsion passes, let's talk about a broken system that allows this to happen. After we shake our heads in disbelief and say how stunned we are that this could ever happen -- let's talk about power. And let's talk about the powerless. Let me preface with this: I am aware that this situation is an outlier. The majority of clergy are people who have sacrificed their family, their time, financial gains to serve their higher power. They are good folk. With mostly good intentions and are usually the kind of people you want on your life team. The ones I have been lucky to know (with one or two exceptions) have been people with incredible love of fairness. They are ethical to an eye-rolling degree. They recognize the responsibility they have assumed as a religious leader -- which is to see the value of every congregant (as excruciatingly hard as that may be) and to never for one second think that they can not be held accountable. And not only to God. To the congregant. To the board of directors. To the audience that listens to them every week. When Barry Freundel violated the women of his congregation, a few things became clear. First- the man is a weak megalomaniac with a sexual fetish. Many articles and blog posts have commented on his vast intellect and his large congregation and his lengthy resume. But here's what he also is: a perverse man who loves power. And here's the kicker that's frustrating tho those who want to neatly file people into categories- you can be both - an intellectual cleric who has published and accomplished great rabbinical feats and someone who uses that exact power to prey on the powerless. The second thing to bubble up to the surface was that the system that allowed him to do this is broken. Namely, a system that allows men to assume that much unilateral control of anything will unearth the worms that lie beneath the soil. Yes, you may also grow a verdant rose garden sometimes- but you must watch vigilantly for the worms. A system that has men making all the legal and religious decisions about women's bodies is a hopelessly flawed system. If laws pertaining to women don't at the very least have women's input and decision making and presence -- than those laws will be used against women. We have seen this happen on Capitol Hill. We have seen it happen in fundamentalist Islamic countries. We see it happening in Orthodox Judaism. Laws pertaining to women's sexuality and bodies must be legislated by women. To avoid the burka or any other obsessive covering of women's bodies and voices, we need to hand the laws (not just the keys to the mikva) over to the women. The third thing that resonated with me after learning about Barry Freundels crimes is that those who are converting into a religion are particularly vulnerable and powerless. Lack of knowledge makes you powerless. Being new to a system (or a school or a profession) makes you vulnerable. It's exactly those people that need to be protected most. And that are easiest to prey on if you are sick and broken and nefarious. Conversion processes need to be vigilantly monitored. Specifically for female converts, those involved in the converting need to not only be men- for so many reasons. Least of all is that converting to Judaism culminates with being naked in a mikva. That is no place for men. No matter what kind of sheet or raincoat or blanket you throw on the woman. Could there be any more vulnerable position than a naked woman immersing in a bath in order to be officially accepted into a religion? Yes there can- when there are also three men observing the ritual. Beyond the ick factor and the inherent patriarchy of it, there's also the worms underneath the soil. We need to be vigilant and protect the vulnerable. And before people get up in arms about using this heinous crime to promote a feminist agenda -- I disagree (although each and every one of us promote agendas every day of our lives). I see it as an opportunity to unearth the worms and re-soil. The current soil is all wrong. At the very least, we can learn from this pitiful event and change the broken system."

At the time, Dr. Phil was given my number and he called promptly and directly (no assistant) to discuss an important national topic. With the Housewife (who is no longer part of the Bravo franchise), I dialed one assistant who patched me through to another until I was finally speaking with my subject after a lengthy hold. That's when the realization hit home: We have reached a pop culture-dominating existential crisis; reality stars are getting too big for their britches or for what any ""15 minutes of fame"" should entail. I did not feel this way about Zach Rance, a contestant on this past season of Big Brother (CBS). While last season's contestants offended the masses with racist and homophobic comments, this year's group carried the heightened awareness of the 24/7 live feeds. Contestants reminded themselves and each other that everything they said could be scrutinized by the public. They also truly seemed to be a more decent bunch. Of course, there were minor slip-ups now and then, not uncommon among overtired, high-adrenaline folks cooped up indoors for days. Christine, a married Gen Y-er, held hands a bit too much with hot Cody, generating outrage from viewers. Another contestant, the innocent and sweet Nicole, freaked out when the word ""retarded"" escaped her lips. She was immediately regretful, stressed and insanely penitent. Zach was loudmouthed and initially seemed somewhat obnoxious, but he would later surprise viewers and his cast mates. In the season premier we were introduced to Zach Rance, 24, as an ""unemployed,"" immature-seeming frat boy who literally said whatever was on his mind. We weren't prepared to like him. Then the tide turned. Zach became fascinating and fun. It was clear that his ""loud mouth"" insults ""I hate you all"" were a veiled ""I love you and I am enjoying this game AND the persona I have created."" Zach, known for his vociferous ""Zach Attacks,"" also formed a very close bond with cast-mate Frankie Grande, pop star Ariana Grande's brother. Viewers were obsessively watching ""Zankie"" videos via Youtube, speculating about the nature of their adorable bond and curious about the cuddling that sometimes took place between beautiful men of differing sexualities. It became obvious that Zach could balance sensitivity with the other aspects of his persona. He could get angry one minute, but we would the sentimentality behind that the next. He mentioned loving and missing his family throughout. He certainly excelled at torturing his cast mates, but he wasn't afraid to shed tears in the diary room sessions. There is a certain appeal to the unexpected and millions of viewers fell in love and were excited to embark on Zach's journey. As certain and determined that he was of being a winner when the show began, he surprised viewers with a magnificent exit post eviction. Greeting Julie Chen with a rose and an adoring and charming demeanor, we watched the always prepared host turn from questioner to coy, lash-batting schoolgirl (apologies, Les Moonves). However, it was not just charm that characterized Zach, it was an overwhelming sense that when you stripped down the confidence of the game player, here was a very humble young man. Here was a man who was aware of the reality behind ""reality."" Earlier on it was clear that Zach noticed the good in people despite what others said. Zach and Donny, an older contestant who was socially excluded by other castmates, struck a bond when Zach was able to see through to Donny's heart. The two had appeared to be polar opposites. The fact that the 24-year-old would bond so well with and show so much respect for the greatly underestimated 42-year-old groundskeeper spoke volumes about Zach's character. It also showed that he had a (wise) mind of his own that could resist social pressures.Zach became notorious during the season for his utterly ridiculous sayings. One middle school student was reportedly suspended for calling his teacher a ""fruit loop dingus,"" a Zach expression that got repeated and retweeted. Zach tells me that he used this expression long before Big Brother.Over the phone, Zach is jovial as he tells me that he and Victoria (who was also a contestant) will be hosting a poker night. The day before, he used his new celebrity status for a good cause, attending a fundraiser to help young twins suffering with cancer. His mother Jill posted a photo from the event wherein it is evident Zach clearly loves children and he is committed to the cause. He is holding one of the girls in a genuinely connected, paternal fashion with a smile that is both wide and natural.""It's just a game,"" Zach says when I mention my surprise that he is co-hosting the poker night with Victoria. He ""hated"" her during the game. He says that she approached him afterwards and asked if they were friends. He said yes right then and there, knowing it was time to flip the switch from ""reality"" to reality. He relates that he has not watched any of the highly entertaining episodes of his season. I tell him I am genuinely shocked. ""Maybe I'll watch it later,"" he replies, ""but I haven't felt the need to. I'm happy. I think I once read that Angelina Jolie does not watch her own movies. I had a great time so maybe I will just leave it alone. There's no need to rehash or get upset when I am this satisfied with how everything turned out.""""But,"" I protest, ""I want to know what you think of the ways your fellow houseguests played you! They took advantage of you. Don't you want to see it?""""I'll get back to you if I end up watching,"" he assures me, adding, ""But I'll wait at least six months. I don't really care. I know what I saw in front of my own eyes. If I see stuff I don't like, I don't know how I'll react.""When I ask him if all the ""Is he straight as he claims or is he gay?"" talk gets to him, his response is ""no, not at all. What are you gonna do? What can you say? There's no point."" I think of what Ru Paul often says and realize that in many instances, I share the mentality: ""What other people say about me is none of my goddamn business."" Zach seems to radiate this mantra. He holds a special 'bro'mantic place in his heart for Frankie, is as much as he says. The ""he doth protest too much"" era is passe. Zach will not partake in that foolishness. He wants me to print one thing about him and he is very adamant: ""Write that I am in the middle of H&M right now dancing."" He said he doesn't plan on staying unemployed for long and is looking to pursue some opportunities in entertainment.That evening, I text Zach to thank him. I decide to add: ""Stay Humble!"" I hope the import of my message is not lost, that these are sound words for anyone who has embraced ""reality"" today."

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said Ebola has killed more than 2,000 people in her country and has brought it to ""a standstill,"" noting that Liberia and two other badly hit countries were already weakened by years of war. (AP Photo/Abbas Dulleh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e5abc2600003500803d34.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since the start of the Ebola outbreak, we’ve noticed a lot of questions floating around out there about exactly what the disease is, how it spreads and how the world is responding to it. To set people’s minds at ease, we decided to tackle a few of the most commonly asked questions about the Ebola virus.  The question: The answer: Before this current outbreak, there have only been 2,418 documented Ebola patients with varying strains of the disease, which is far too few patients for scientists to learn from and treat with experimental drugs. Also, the relatively small amount of people who would have benefited from an Ebola cure (previous outbreaks are contained after several hundred are sickened) might mean that big pharmaceutical companies don’t have enough of a financial incentive to pursue expensive drug research.Then there’s the “10-year-slide” in research funding for the National Institutes of Health, which doles out money for research projects around the nation. Dr. Francis Collins, head of the NIH, told HuffPost’s Sam Stein that his institute has been working on a vaccine for Ebola since 2001 -- and would probably have had it ready in time for this current outbreak had it not been for money shortfalls.More fundamentally, though, treating viral infections is a lot more challenging than treating bacterial infections. While we have a range of antibiotics to defeat bacterial infections, most of the treatments we have to combat viruses are vaccines, which are only effective to prevent infection -- not cure it. The most successful antiviral medications out there are one for HIV/AIDS, herpes and the flu.  Learn more about the experimental treatments for Ebola, like blood transfusions or drugs that are in clinical trials. Dr. Felicity Hartnell, who is a clinical research fellow at Oxford University, holds the vial of the Ebola vaccine called Chimp Adenovirus type 3 (ChAd3) before the first healthy UK volunteer receives an Ebola vaccine at the Oxford Vaccine Group Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM) on September 17, 2014 in Oxford, England. (Photo by Steve Parsons-WPA Pool/Getty Images)The question: The answer: Politically, the drumbeat for a U.S. travel ban on travelers from the affected countries Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia is getting louder. But there are several public health reasons why CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden and other officials are resisting the idea.1. Anything that makes it harder for help to enter Ebola-ravaged countries (by, say, not allowing health workers to come back after volunteering), will only worsen the epidemic and make it more likely to spread to other countries in Africa.2. While a travel ban may not affect most Americans or the U.S.'s national trade, it would have a devastating economic impact on the developing countries that could destabilize them politically, worsening their response to the virus.3. It could motivate travelers from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to hide their country of origin, making it more difficult for government officials to track recent arrivals.The question: The answer: This is perhaps the one message various public health authorities are united on: Ebola is not airborne. Doctors and scientists have been fighting the disease since 1976, and based on the evidence they’ve collected, the virus is not spread by air, water or food (except by handling infected bushmeat).Instead, officials say, there is evidence that the virus spreads via direct contact with an infected person or their body fluids like blood, vomit and diarrhea. That’s why the people who are most at risk of contracting the disease are not, say, those who sat next to an Ebola patient on the plane, but those who cared for an Ebola patient or buried the body of someone who died of Ebola.But the consensus among the scientific community isn’t as clear cut. In addition to hypotheses from a few virologists who theorize that a mutation to become airborne is possible (but extremely unlikely), there are also a few controversial studies in animals that could suggest an unknown mode of transmission that hasn't been officially recognized yet, reports the New York Times.In one from 1995, two monkeys contracted Ebola from a group of monkeys who did have Ebola -- despite the fact that they didn't have direct contact with each other. In another from 2012, a group of monkeys contracted a strain of Ebola from a group of pigs, again without any direct contact between the two groups.A hazmat worker moves a barrel while cleaning outside an apartment building of a hospital worker, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2014, in Dallas. (AP Photo/LM Otero)The question: The answer:As of Oct. 19, the number of people infected with Ebola is 9,936, and the number who have died is 4,877. But just because officials say this outbreak has a 70 percent mortality rate, it doesn’t mean that the death rate has “risen.""Disease detectives on the ground are having a difficult time tracking all Ebola patients and their outcomes. While this outbreak's current mortality rate seems to be around 50 percent (what you get by dividing 4,493 by 8,997), the World Health Organization thinks the death rates are even higher based on the outcomes of patients they have been able to track from infection to outcome.Based on the outcomes of 1,737 patients WHO was able to follow from the beginning to the end of their illness, the current outbreak actually has a 70 percent mortality rate, according to a study of the first nine months of the epidemic, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The rate was consistent across all three countries that have been hit hardest by the virus. Among health workers, the mortality rates are 56.1 percent in Guinea, 68.4 percent for Sierra Leone and 80 percent in Liberia.And on a related note…  How do officials predict future Ebola infection numbers?   The answer: WHO predicts that if strong relief efforts don’t turn the tide soon, there could be 20,000 Ebola cases by Nov. 2.The way they do that is by taking past infection numbers from August and seeing what patient numbers will be if August’s infection rates continue growing as they have been, explained WHO Ebola response team member and study co-author Prof. Christl Donnelly of Imperial College London.The question: The answer: The Spanish nurse who contracted Ebola from her patient had a dog named Excalibur. While he wasn’t showing Ebola symptoms, public health officials in Spain euthanized him on the chance that he could pass the virus on to human beings.Meanwhile, nurse Nina Pham’s dog, Bentley, is being quarantined and cared for by several Dallas city agencies while Pham undergoes Ebola treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. The two divergent approaches reflect uncertainty about how exactly Ebola jumps from animals to humans, and whether dogs can be infected with Ebola.In 2001 during an Ebola outbreak in Gabon, up to 25 percent of dogs from infected towns tested positive for Ebola antibodies, which means they had some of the virus to them, reports the Associated Press. But since Ebola-infected dogs don’t seem to show symptoms, it’s not clear what exactly needs to be done to dogs who may have been exposed to Ebola. Quarantine them the normal 21 days? Take daily temperature readings? In Bentley's case, only time will tell.This Oct. 13, 2014, photo released via Twitter by the City of Dallas Public Information Managing Director Sana Syed shows Bentley in Dallas, the one-year-old King Charles Spaniel belonging to Nina Pham, the nurse who contracted Ebola.

From 1976 to 2007, flu-related deaths have ranged from 3,000 to 49,000 people every year in the U.S. and 50,000 people are expected to contract HIV, another potentially deadly virus with no cure. Meanwhile, only four people in the U.S. have Ebola right now. So why do 45 percent of Americans worry that they or their loved ones may contract Ebola?The answer, said Cornell psychology professor Valerie Reyna, is fear of the unknown, which produces more dread than a familiar fear. While that fear is rational, said Reyna to HuffPost's Carolyn Gregoire, certain social (media) contexts can multiply and amplify perceived threat, creating unnecessary hysteria. Public officials can calm fears, said Reyna, by being completely truthful -- especially about situations in which they’re not sure of all the facts. Have a question for Healthy Living?

14,POLITICS,Tom Cotton's Consultant Who 'May Not Exist' Actually Does,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-cotton-senate_n_6024944.html,,2014-10-23,"UNITED STATES - FEBRUARY 26: Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., appears at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in Rayburn Building titled 'International Wildlife Trafficking Threats to Conservation and National Security.' (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8da822200004301dd7d47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It turns out Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton (R) was not employing some sort of phantom consultant in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor -- it's merely a new one without a long paper trail.Since March, Cotton has paid some $323,000 to a firm called Right Solutions Partners LLC, according to federal election filings. One news outlet noticed that fact, but also could find no sign of a human being attached to the firm, and no indication the firm had done work anywhere else. When no explanation was forthcoming from Cotton's campaign, it prompted a headline that said the congressman was paying a consultant who ""may not exist.""The campaign did eventually get around to explaining to HuffPost that the person behind the firm is a former top fundraiser for the Club for Growth, Erika Sather, and that the money had been paid to her through Right Solutions, which she created a little more than a year ago. Sather also has reportedly signed on to help Rand Paul build his national fundraising base, and has worked with her former boss at the Club for Growth, Pat Toomey, among others.In the super-heated atmosphere in the waning days of a bitter campaign, it can be easy to spin disparate facts into a suspicious picture. While Cotton's campaign did not explain why it hadn't clarified the situation sooner to head off an unflattering story, Sather herself agreed that the only thing that was unusual about her arrangement with Cotton wasn't unusual at all. Her firm just hasn't been around long enough to generate much history.""That's correct, my firm is new,"" Sather said by email when HuffPost was able to reach her Wednesday evening. She'd have answered earlier, she said, but she had been busy doing her job of fundraising. She is, after all, responsible for all of Cotton's national buck-raking.Mystery solved."
