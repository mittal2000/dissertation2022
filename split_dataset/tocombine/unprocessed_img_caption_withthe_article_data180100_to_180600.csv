Copyright Â© 2012 Dana Adam Shapiro. Excerpted with permission by Scribner, a Division of Simon & Schuster, Inc.NAME: Ann  OCCUPATION: Non-profit YEAR OF BIRTH: 1972 CURRENT MARRIAGE STATUS: Divorced DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN? Two boys, 8-years-old and 5-years-old WHERE YOU GREW UP: GA TOWN WHERE YOU LIVE: NY YEAR OF MARRIAGE: 2001 HOW LONG YOU DATED BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED: Five years YEAR OF DIVORCE: 2012In high school, I liked my looks, but I didn't know that other people did. I was never the hot girl. I was told: ""When you grow up, you'll be pretty."" Boys liked me, but I thought it was because I was nicer than most girls. I don't know what was going on with me, but up until my marriage, I only liked the guys who weren't that into me. The good guys, I'd get bored so fast. Chris and I met at a restaurant. He had just moved to New York, but he started working immediately as an actor. I'd been waiting tables for four and a half years so I was like, ""Wow, he's on it!"" I was surprised I started falling for him because he was so clean-cut and beautiful, and that was never attractive to me. But I could see that he was talented, and every time he came around, he was just so nice. He didn't have that New York, actor-y, pessimistic sense of humor where everybody's too cool, just going pfft, pfft. He liked all these cheesy, romantic songs that to me were like blech. I couldn't believe I was going gaga over a guy who was playing ""The Dance"" by Garth Brooks on guitar in front of me! But he was doing it, singing, and I was like, ""Aww! What a sweet soul!"" He just seemed so wholesome, so pure. God, I'll never be that dumb again.   It was heartbreaking, the way I found out about everything. He was shooting a movie on location. For the first part of the shoot, he kept in contact but I could see him turning into a weirdo, being really distant, thinking they're doing this heavy shit that's gonna blow some minds, y'know? Like: ""Oh, you wouldn't understand."" Like they're making Apocalypse Now. It was creeping me out. I just wanted to go, ""Dude, it's a movie. It's a bunch of hot people in make-up. Relax.""Our video chats got to the point where he was just: ""Uh-huh. Uh-huh."" So I thought, ""Okay, I'll just leave him alone until he gets done with this character."" But when he came home, something felt wrong. All of a sudden, he was really concerned with wearing ""cool"" clothes. He kept calling it Williamsburg. Like, now he's Mr. Grit, y'know? He was just acting like an asshole. Nothing felt true. And then I started getting that bad feeling. It was burning. One night we were in the kitchen and I just went, ""Oh my God, Chris, are you having an affair?"" He slumped into the kitchen counter and said: ""Really? You think after all this time being married we're not going to have feelings for someone else?""   I was pretty sure who it was, they'd worked together on the movie. So I asked him: ""Did you kiss her?"" He said: ""No, it was just this emotional connection..."" I started crying. ""I'm so sorry you had to go to her to get your emotional needs met. I always told you that you could talk to me about anything."" He was clearly annoyed that we were even having this conversation. But I said, ""I think we need to call a therapist."" At this point, I didn't even think he had sex with her -- or anybody else. I didn't even think he'd kissed her. I was so insecure, I started thinking that, somehow, this was all my fault. I must have done something to make him so unhappy. I thought maybe I was hideous looking. Or that maybe I was walking around with a faulty vagina. So I went to my gynecologist and I said, ""Look at it. Test it out. Is it in working order?"" I thought maybe I needed to get one of those surgeries down there [laughs]. But he said it was fine. And then I went to my girlfriend, who is bisexual, and I was like, ""Look at it."" And she was like, ""You're fine!"" And then she dropped her pants and said, ""Look, they're all different."" And hers did a weird thing, but it was fine, too [laughs]. So Chris and I went to the therapist. And the whole time he was acting like: ""This is ridiculous."" We went back home and he had to leave the next day for a photo shoot in LA. And that's when I started thinking: ""I'm gonna do something so crazy when he's gone."" I never knew his [email] password; I wouldn't even think to ask. So after he left for the shoot, I called him, all frantic, like: ""Oh, shit! School just called and I need to print out some pictures for something -- can I have your password?"" And he was like, ""Uh, but..."" ""Just give it real quick."" ""Well, you could use..."" ""No, no -- this is faster."" I did a good job. Real savvy. And that's how I saw all the emails between him and her. I just typed in the first letter of her name and there they were. He was telling her about how he'd been feeling dead and lifeless the last decade, and how now, finally, he knows what true passion is. He said he felt like he'd been strapped onto a rocket and launched into space. It was awful. My body went into shock. My hands closed up, and my feet. I couldn't hear. It was like I'd just watched someone get killed right in front of me.  I called my friend Lynne and said, ""Buy a pack of cigarettes."" (I had quit smoking two years before.) So she came over, I got onto Chris' other computer and that's where I found all these photos of them in bed together. What I just hated -- and what stuck with me for so long -- were the pictures he took of her looking like a tortured, beautiful soul. That whole bit, like, Oh, don't look at me. There was one of her sitting outside the hotel room with their dirty sheets in a ball, like, oopsy daisy! It felt like they were laughing at me. So I called him: ""I found the emails and I saw the pictures.""   He said, ""Ann, stop reading them."" I said, ""Okay. I'm sorry."" But I didn't stop reading them. I forwarded them to myself and to my friend. Because I knew he'd erase them and I didn't want to be able to talk myself out of what I'd seen. Everything fully came out around New Years. We were driving, and I said, ""Have you ever been with anyone before this? Or is this the only time?"" He said, ""Four or five others."" I couldn't even react anymore. I said, ""There's got to be more. How can I try to fix something if I don't know the whole truth? Give me the whole truth so I can know if I can deal with it."" So on New Years day, he gave me the list -- about 40 names. One girl got pregnant; he had to pay for an abortion. Another one was one of my best friends. I was her maid of honor. She was at our wedding. I remember them singing, ""You're the One that I Want"" together, and I was just thinking, 'Oh, there's crazy Lexi humping my husband! What a funny gal!' At that point, nothing would have shocked me, so I had to ask him, for real: ""Have you ever killed anybody? Accidentally or anything? Have you ever raped anyone? Have you had sex with a man? Are you a pedophile? Did you ever sleep with my sister or my cousin? Just tell me the truth."" I was destroyed, and I was mad, but then I started thinking: 'This must be hard for him, too. He's got to have so much guilt. Let him process it, give him a chance to do the work he needs to do. Maybe this is a chance for us.' I was so willing. But he couldn't do it. And I got tired.  I made plans to go to Palm Springs. Before I left, I said, ""I'm afraid I'm going to have to let you go. I don't want to let you go, but I will if I have to."" He said, ""Do whatever you have to do to be happy."" And that's what it took. I went to Palm Springs, did a ceremony for myself, let him go, came back, and said, ""I want a divorce."" And it felt so good. I agonized over that for the longest time. But then I really came alive. You know when you're a kid, like eight-years-old, and nothing's gone wrong yet, everything's pure, and you feel like, 'Oh God, I can do anything'? That's how I feel again. I'm through being a ""cool"" girl. From now on, I'm only gonna love full-on, huge, and no games. I want to be completely transparent, through and through. Even when I think: 'Oh no, this is not a good side of me, this is an embarrassing side, this could be icky' -- I'm not going to act like it's not there. I know now that you have to put everything on the table. If you don't, that's not fair to the other person because you have to at least give them the chance to love all those 'off' things about you. And if you can fall in love being completely who you are, that sounds like the best thing ever. If I end up being alone, so be it. But I don't want to fake anything ever, ever, ever again.You Can Be Right (Or You Can Be Married): Looking for Love in the Age of Divorce hits shelves September 4. "
1,TRAVEL,What Does It Mean When Your Cruise Ship Is Sick?,"Joel Connable, Contributor

As the anchor, I would toss to the reporter, who was live on the scene, telling us about a macabre-sounding disease called, ""norovirus.""As we head into the end of summer and beginning of Fall, we will hear more about the norovirus because cruise ships will start their Caribbean cruises and the cold and flu season kicks off again. This means more stories about cruise passengers getting ill while at sea.The word ""norovirus"" does sound pretty bad. I even thought there was something dangerous about sailing on cruise ships after I heard about case after case. That was until I talked to doctors at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and found out that norovirus is nothing more than the stomach flu -- and it isn't a disease that people only get on cruise ships.According to the braniacs at the CDC, ""the common cold is the only illness more common, and the CDC estimates that there are more than 20 million cases of norovirus annually.""I just came back from a cruise with my parents who are in their 80s. If anyone would be sensitive to illnesses or the norovirus, it would be my mom and dad. None of us got sick after 12 days at sea onboard the Celebrity Silhouette. Healthy people who wash their hands and eat their vegetables are unlikely to get sick on cruise ship, even if there are people with norovirus onboard. Thanks Mom.I have been on more than 70 cruises and never been sick. More people get sick flying on planes every year compared to people who cruise. Fewer people cruise, of course, which makes the comparison a little unfair, but if someone gets sick on a plane, should we all not fly?""Norovirus is a very contagious virus,"" say researchers at the CDC. ""You can get norovirus from an infected person, contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces. The virus causes your stomach or intestines or both to get inflamed (acute gastroenteritis). This leads you to have stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea and to throw up."" The bottom line is, you barf and get the runs.So why do we hear so frequently about norovirus if it is not a cruise ship disease? Should we be scared to go on cruises, since we could all end up in our staterooms barfing and pooping? The answer is no.We hear about norovirus on cruise ships, first, because news stations love to report the story. It makes a good, ""if it bleeds, it leads headline."" The second and more important reason is that cruise ships are one of the few hospitality industries that must report every sickness on a to the CDC. The CDC tells me, ""Nowhere else in the public health system of the United States is norovirus a reportable illness. Norovirus is not a 'cruise ship' illness, but an illness commonly seen in many settings throughout the United States.""When you stay in a hotel, there may be several people who are suffering from the stomach flu. You wouldn't know about them because you probably won't see them. When someone gets sick in a hotel, they don't go downstairs to the front desk. Even if they do tell the front desk, the hotel does not have to report it to any official organization, thus there are no records. On a cruise ship, sick passengers go to the medical office, they tell the doctor they are sick and the doctor has to notify the CDC that a passenger was treated for that illness. The CDC says, ""Anyone can be infected with norovirus and get sick. Also, you can have norovirus illness many times in your life. Norovirus illness can be serious, especially for young children and older adults."" The people who cause norovirus on cruise ships are usually sick before they get on. Other people get sick because they haven't washed their hands properly, they are elderly or they have some sort of disease that compromises their immune systemNorovirus, just like the flu and, even a cold, is more dangerous to the elderly and small children. The smart people at the CDC say, ""Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States. Each year, it causes about 21 million illnesses and contributes to about 70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths. Norovirus is also the most common cause of foodborne-disease outbreaks in the United States."" The CDC inspects all cruise ships that dock in the United States. It's part of their Vessel Sanitation Program. Cruise ships are scored, just like many restaurants are scored by health inspectors. You can see cruise ship inspection scores hereIf you go to the link, you will see that most cruise ships get health inspection scores in the 90s and even perfect scores. (Eighty six or above is considered passing.) The Vessel Sanitation Program also monitors vessel cleanliness and there is no correlation between scores and outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness. In fact, Crown Princess, which was forced to end a cruise early in February 2012 to contain an outbreak, scored a 100 on its November 2011 inspection. The twice-yearly exam is known to be thorough and challengingThis may be a healthy time to sail, as cruise lines are developing proactive procedures to ensure that passengers on voyages, particularly throughout the winter season, don't get sick. If you cruise, you will see the staff cleaning everything all the time and you can't walk into a dining area without having your hands sprayed with hand sanitizer.I think cruising is one of the best ways to travel. If you like to pay one price and see several destinations with all your meals included, it is one of the best all-inclusive vacations around. Thank God for our immune systems and Purell hand sanitizer.If you ever have a question about cruising or travel or you want to share your stories, send me an email at joel@travelnewsanddeals.com. Happy travels everyone."

(AP Photo, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baeb0842400005100967ded.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Malia Mattoch McManusHONOLULU, Aug 17 (Reuters) - A team of researchers trying to solve the mystery of aviator Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance said on Friday that underwater video from a Pacific island has revealed a field of man-made debris that could be remnants of her plane.The footage was collected in July by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) during a $2.2 million expedition to Nikumaroro in the Republic of Kiribati.Unsolved questions about Earhart's fate have long heightened her legendary status as a pioneering aviator, and TIGHAR's voyage to seek clues in her disappearance gained interest far beyond the shores of the remote island where the team searched.The search was plagued by technical issues in what researchers described as challenging ocean conditions off the Nikumaroro reef, where they believe Earhart's plane landed and was then swept away into the sea.TIGHAR Director Ric Gillespie said that once his team experienced the harsh conditions, they knew they would not find a ""nice intact airplane."" He added the local environment is ""very severe"" because the ocean ""tears things up and tries to bury"" them.The TIGHAR team returned to Honolulu, which is 1,800 miles (2,900 km) northeast of Nikumaroro, with no wreckage found. But the researchers said they took hours of underwater video, which they could not view while in Nikumaroro.TIGHAR said on Friday that one segment of the video shows a field of man-made debris that the group maintains could have come from Earhart's plane.Gillespie could not give a size of the man-made objects shown in the video, saying there was nothing in the images with which to compare them for scale.To the untrained eye, the photo supplied by TIGHAR does not appear to show any evidence of wreckage. But Gillespie said forensic imaging specialist Jeff Glickman of the firm Photek Inc identified the images as a debris field.""It's still very early days, but we have man-made objects in a debris field in the place where we'd expect to find it if our theory on the airplane is correct,"" Gillespie said.The TIGHAR announcement comes two days before a Sunday broadcast of a Discovery Channel special on TIGHAR's expedition.""We were rushing to get at least some video reviewed so we could show something (on Discovery),"" Gillespie said. He added that his group has reviewed only 30 percent of the video they collected.""We don't want to oversell this. It's more evidence. It is where it should be, and that is encouraging,"" Gillespie said. ""If it does appear to be airplane wreckage, it becomes figuring out how to go back and look at it.""Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departed Papua New Guinea July 2, 1937, during Earhart's quest to circumnavigate the globe along an equatorial route. But they disappeared that day and emergency searches did not locate them.Hans Van Tilburg, coordinator of the maritime heritage program for the Pacific region of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said making a discovery of a decades-old object in the Pacific Ocean is very difficult.""The Pacific Ocean is a high-energy environment and the aircraft they are looking for is quite fragile,"" he said. ""Therefore finding something and making identification is very difficult. You are looking for broken pieces."" (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis and Lisa Shumaker)PHOTOS:"

From firearms and the Colt Revolver, to Mark Twain and Harriett Beecher Stowe, to the first public park (Bushnell Park opened the same year as Central Park in New York City) and museum (Wadsworth Antheneum). Today, however, we are a small city that is too often forced to confront a frustrating duality. We are proud and grateful that global companies like Aetna, The Hartford, Travelers and United Technologies Corporation continue to make Hartford their corporate home. At the same time, Hartford has the highest unemployment rate in Connecticut (hovering around 14.5 percent, but down from a high of 17 percent when I took office in June 2010) and one of the lowest median incomes in the country. Conversely, Brookings Institution recently named us the most productive city in the world and Parade Magazine named us the second hardest working city in the country. Our graduation rate, while dramatically improved since we launched a comprehensive education reform effort five years ago, is still no more than 50 percent, yet Richard Florida named us the 17 most creative city in America.With these weighty issues at the forefront of my public policy agenda, and considering that we are jam-packed into a small geographic area, there is very little room for error whenever we launch a dynamic initiative that intends to dramatically shift the way Hartford's residents think about government and the services we provide. Said another way, they are skeptical -- and, as can undoubtedly be said in every city and small town throughout the country, who can blame them?When I took office, following a scandal that further depressed Hartford and resulted in the arrest and resignation of the former Mayor, I immediately began the process of analyzing how we could tackle some of our most dramatic problems, particularly in the areas of education, income and job development, through better coordination and collaboration. As a small city of only 18 square miles and almost 2,000 acres of historic park land, there are over 250 churches and thousands of non-profit social service providers. These institutions and service providers, while necessary and important, compete for dollars, patients or clients and publicity. Out of this concentration of services and a dwindling ability to provide financial support grew Opportunities Hartford, an ambitious initiative designed to identify the greatest short, medium and long-term opportunities that exist in education, job readiness/creation/career advancement and family sustaining income, expand and enhance those opportunities, and funnel public and private sector funds to identified and targeted areas and programs.The program has been in existence for about a year and is being led by a work group of eight and a steering committee of 40 from various sectors across Hartford. Fundamentally, it coincides nicely with my Administration's efforts to make our Downtown more welcoming, walkable and vibrant through the iQuilt Plan and the recently received federal Department of Transportation TIGER IV award. This almost $20 million dollar project -- the Intermodal Triangle Project -- will create over 275 job-years of work and generate almost $2 million dollars of new economic activity. Coupled with the work we are doing with our Congressional Delegation to have the Colt Gateway designated as a national park, which could generate an additional 1,000 jobs and infuse over $150 million dollars in sales back into the local economy, we are equally primed to change the physical landscape in Hartford in meaningful, lasting and dramatic ways.While these important infrastructure projects move forward, we are simultaneously preparing for the final release of the Opportunities work plan, one that will include concrete immediate, medium and long-term action steps to continue increasing educational attainment, bridging the gap between self-sufficiency and the median income and increasing the supply of jobs that pay a fair wage and provide benefits. While this project is still somewhat in its infancy, it promises to completely revolutionize how non-profit and social service providers look at government as a funding source and how they assess which services to deliver and how to deliver them. While it is odd to many to hear a Democrat talk about compression, consolidation and collaboration in ways that reduce size and increase efficiency -- thus generating cost-savings -- mayors do not have the luxury of accepting the status quo, we are often forced (by duty and psychological make-up) to take positions that often run opposite of both conventional wisdom and what's generally politically popular. Opportunities Hartford is primed to do just that, and Hartford, which undoubtedly will be all the better for it and might once again find itself an iconoclast; leading the way in innovation and creativity."

Record heat throughout the US farm belt states have curtailed crop production and likely will send corn and soybean prices to record highs according to the US Department of Agriculture. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2cf211f0000250123ac60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bloomberg View:Record-high corn prices should be sending a clear message to policy makers in Washington: Requiring people to put corn-based fuel in their gas tanks is a bad idea.Since 2005, the U.S. government has mandated that gasoline contain ethanol, almost all of it derived from corn. The policy, ostensibly aimed at reducing the countryâs dependence on foreign oil and at improving the environment, has been a bonanza for farmers. Land planted with corn soared by a fourth after Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which required that gasoline producers blend 15 billion gallons of ethanol into the nationâs gasoline supply by 2015.Now the drought of 2012, the worst in more than 50 years, is making clear the downside of a policy that leads the U.S. to devote 40 percent its corn harvest to fuel production. With this yearâs crop expected to be the smallest in six years, corn prices have jumped 60 percent since June. The ethanol requirements are aggravating the rise in food costs and spreading it to the price of gasoline, which is up almost 40 cents a gallon since the start of July.More from Bloomberg View:  - Carbon Taxes Cut Debt, Cool Planet - Can Gates Do for the Toilet What He Did for the Computer?Buying MeatThe damage is far-reaching. Beef and pork producers are slaughtering their stocks at a record pace to cut use of corn feed that costs two-thirds more than three months ago. This week, President Barack Obama told a campaign rally in Iowa that the federal government will buy $170 million of meat to prop up the market. U.S. cattle herds next year are forecast to be the smallest since 1952, a guarantee of more expensive food in years to come.Ethanol production and the drought are hardly the only forces contributing to higher prices. Exports of corn to China and other countries also play a role, as do ethanol policies in Europe. And it is true that ending the ethanol mandate might cut food prices by no more than 5 percent at best.Still, the drought lays bare the folly of trying to expand an industry where the economic fundamentals donât make much sense. Based on its energy content, ethanol is roughly 50 percent more expensive than gasoline, and the acreage required to produce it distorts land prices. Farmers this year planted the largest corn crop in 75 years, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The price of an acre of prime farmland in Iowa -- the nationâs biggest corn producer -- has more than doubled in the past five years, a time when other real estate prices tumbled.Researchers at Texas A&M University have estimated that diverting corn to make ethanol forces Americans to pay $40 billion a year in higher food prices. On top of that, it costs taxpayers $1.78 in subsidies for each gallon of gasoline that corn-based ethanol replaces, according to the Congressional Budget Office.As for the environmental virtues of ethanol, those were debunked long ago. True, gasoline-ethanol blends can lower greenhouse emissions by 20 percent, and ethanol can replace toxic additives such as benzene that make gasoline more combustible. But growing corn is energy intensive. Tractors that run on diesel fuel must plow fields, plant seed, spread fertilizer and pesticides (that run into local waterways), harvest the crop and haul it to refining plants. Unlike oil, ethanol is highly corrosive and canât be transported by pipeline. Trucks or trains must carry the finished product to gasoline blenders. By some calculations, ethanol takes more energy to produce than it yields, negating the environmental benefits.More than 150 House members and 25 U.S. senators, as well as the director general of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, have asked Obama to temporarily suspend the ethanol mandate in order to check the rise in food prices. He should listen to them, and Congress should permanently roll back the ethanol requirements.This isnât to say ethanol doesnât have a place in the U.S. energy mix. Gasoline needs to be combined with agents that carry oxygen to help cars and trucks run more efficiently. Ethanol fits the bill. But the government should let the demand for ethanol obey the laws of the market, rather than the desires of the agricultural lobby.Read more opinion online from Bloomberg View: Can Gates Do for the Toilet What He Did for the Computer?  and Carbon Taxes Cut Debt, Cool Planet.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb355cf200000e8000031f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One thing that you don't want to admit to in the tech world is getting old. (I guess that's true in general but in technology land it's almost a taboo.)Technology has a reputation for being a young person's game. That's a perception that I would like to change. But it's tough when we technologists believe it ourselves. Here are three examples of ageism that happened to me all on the same day:A young 20-something techie explained to me that she was getting old fast and needed to start a startup before she got too old to have great ideas. ""Everyone knows that after 30 your mind slows down and the billion dollar ideas stop flowing.""A post-50 techie told me on the phone that he was getting old, feeling slow and unhealthy, and that perhaps his best years were behind him. He had been a giant lion in Silicon Valley in the '90s and now he feels like a little lamb.A good friend sent me his resume: He just got suckered into early retirement by his employer of 20 years and feels totally lost in the world of hack-a-thons, meetups and fancy new Java VM languages. For the last 20 years he's been coding UNIX operating system tools while being an excellent father. And now he thinks he's competing with his post-college kids for the same jobs!Lies! It's all lies! (Is there a Myth Busters show for misconceptions about aging?)To counter this sort of self-inflicted ageism I'll use myself as an example:Sure, when I was young I had a dozen ideas a day. But most of them slipped away. I hardly ever completed anything. Now that I am older, I have the ability to finish what I started. I can ensure an awesome end-product because I've been through the whole product development cycle too many times to count.When I was young all the ideas that excited me were mine. Now, I don't care where the idea comes from. I'm much more interested in success for the team than pushing my agenda. I think this is one of the reasons why 99 percent of all startups fail: Young people, pushing their ideas, unable to gain perspective, chasing after personal success. A successful startup usually has an inter-generational mix of people at its core.But enough about me: Let's use Bill Gates as example: He dropped out of Harvard to create Microsoft and bulldozed his way to the top of the technology heap. He did some stuff when he was young that I bet he is not proud of, just like any normal human, but he ostensibly ""won"" the game.Bill's best ideas were not those from his youth. His best ideas, and what history will remember him for, came after he retired and created the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife! Reinventing the toilet might not be as sexy sounding as another Pinterest-Photo-Streaming-Mobile-Coupon app, but it's 100 times more important. Long after that Pinterest-Photo-Streaming-Mobile-Coupon app is forgotten, the Gates Foundation's work in sanitation will be celebrated.I bet Bill feels older, perhaps slower, but he looks like he's in great shape. When you're young you don't have to exercise and eat right. As you age you have to do it. I know for us aging hackers the idea of exercise is about as appealing as an hour spent with IE6. But it must be done. This morning I put Billy Blanks in the old DVD player and did my Tae Bo Flex. And the great thing about being an old hacker is that all the stuff we learned back in the '80s and '90s is still relevant and critical: LISP, Objective-C, UNIX, POJOs, User Centered Design. Our skills are not outdated! Our skills are continually rediscovered by every new generation.So if you're young, don't rush into an ill-thought-out startup because you fear your biological clock. And if you're old, get your game face on and keep hacking!"
10,WELLNESS,The Art of Living: Falconry,"Kate Moulene, Contributor
Founder of Capian Enterprises",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/falconry_us_5b9c1387e4b03a1dcc7c2af4,"Falconers are interested in the magic that is derived for a brief moment when a mere mortal is permitted to join forces with nature's most adept, feathered lightning bolt.",2012-08-17,2012-08-01-168309_1603819732216_1137781287_31460676_5874801_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-08-01-168309_1603819732216_1137781287_31460676_5874801_n-thumb.jpg," When most people hear the word falcon they think of the Atlanta Falcons, the football team, or a Falcon jet, but falconry is a sport that has no interest in pigskin footballs, hot cheerleaders, or private rental jets. Falconers are interested in the magic that is derived for a brief moment when a mere mortal is permitted to join forces with nature's most adept, feathered lightning bolt. These aerial marvels, which often weigh less than five pounds, have been the inspiration for stealth jets and avian history. With eyesight eight times more accurate than a human (1), and species that have clocked diving speeds at more than 200 miles per hour (2), the 238 species (3) of hawks that exist worldwide are winged marvels.When people use the words ""hawk"" and ""falcon"" there is confusion about exactly what birds are being described. Hawk is a generic term (like raptor) that includes all species in the order falconiformes. Falcons include only members of the family falconidae, which are birds that fall into a category of ""longwings."" All falcons and hawks are birds of prey and can be referred to as raptors, and a person who hunts with a raptor is called a falconer.Getting a falconry license is learning the art of hunting with an aviary partner. Long before your local grocery store or the option of fast food -- or even personal firearms -- men (and women) who wanted to eat meat took their feathered friend out into the fields to scurry up a rabbit or some other tasty morsel. According to The Modern Apprentice, falconry is often considered the world's oldest sport, with records dating as early as 722-705 B.C. In the 4th century BC there are pictures of gold coins with Alexander the Great with a hawk on his fist. (4)When falconers fly their birds the raptors are free-flying and have the option of leaving if they choose. Some birds do leave, but it is rare as a remarkable partnership forms between the man and bird. In the wild it is estimated by falcon experts that up to 75 percent of first-year birds die in the wild (5). The intrusion of overpopulated developments has taken away much of these animals native land and native hunting grounds, so survival has become a deep challenge. Environmental impact studies done by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services have shown clearly that falconry has absolutely no negative impact on the wildlife populations, and in some cases the boundless care that falconers have taken for these birds has helped to protect them. (6)The legal permission to hunt with a bird is regulated by the Department of Fish and Game. The first step for an apprentice is to find a licensed Master Falconer who will agree to oversee your training for the first two years of practice. I began my journey after reaching out to Bill Murphy, the president of the California Hawking Club, who I found on Facebook. Bill wanted me to know some local falconers and women in the sport, so he introduced me to Helga. Helga is a drop dead gorgeous blond brainiac who has a Ph.D. in forensic psychology. It did not take long to realize that most falconers are extremely interesting people. One of the great things about engaging in any new endeavor is that you meet people whom you would never possibly encounter in your own repetitive daily life.Helga invited me to join her one day at a dusty equestrian center tucked at the bottom of the Los Padres National Park, where dozens of little midget horses from Iceland were racing madly around an arena being judged on their ability to buzz past one another at shocking speeds. Helga also competes in equestrian events. ""They are the Ferrari of horses -- five gears,"" she explained. One faster than the next. Little packages of forward momentum.As we stood in the middle of nowhere, a hawk flew over us and perched on the edge of the nest it had built for its offspring high among the branches of a lone tree. Take note, falcon nests are huge. Even from the ground one could see that several small chihuahuas could make themselves quite at home inside this little habitat. Peaking over the ridge of the 100-foot high aerie were several little hawks quite excited about the 'rents coming home with a meal. As I watched the birds, listened to Helga, and tried to keep track of the ponies roaring by every few seconds, a feather came floating down from the nest and landed within a half inch from my foot. I glanced at it a moment, picked up the little plume and tucked it safely away in my pocket. Helga began taking me to field meets and introduced me to some of the best falconers in the area. One of them, David Peterson, tech genius in his day life, offered to work with me as an apprentice. By the time I had all the necessary paperwork in hand and built a proper mews -- which is another world for a preposterously large birdhouse -- I had moved far out into the valley beyond Los Angeles civilization, which put me out of reach to David and Helga's hunting areas, and I had to start the search for a Master Falconer all over. I was blessed to meet Stephanie Sayre, who runs a raptor rehabilitation and education program called Wings of Discovery, and she offered to take me under her wing as well. I trapped Theia, my first Red Tail, on Nov. 23, 2011. Exhilarating, adrenaline-charged, nerve-racking and elated are a few words that come to mind. Reaching down and picking up a young Red Tail in my arms was one of the most breathless moments of my life.My time with Theia was like a walking meditation, quiet and focused and learning to stay completely present in each moment. She was exceptionally patient with my naÃ¯ve efforts and seemed to watch me as much as I watched her -- learning to trust me and understand that I was there to care for her and support her own efforts in hunting. I allowed her to hang out in my office all day because she hated being alone, and I quite frankly hated not having her near. In June, after seven months of spending hours each day together, it was time to let Theia go free. We walked down the riverbed next to my house and for a long time sat together as the sun started to drop. There were rabbits and ground squirrels scurrying everywhere, but she was well-fed and content, so she just sat with me and enjoyed the peace. After about 15 minutes she flew up to a nearby tree and perched. I think she was waiting to see how long it would be till I whistled, signaling her to return to my arm. No whistle came. Then she took flight. Magnificent and alone, she flew down the valley to a higher perch on a beautiful oak. I waited until it was dark and went inside. In the morning she was gone. Twice she has flown back to trees in the yard where I have seen her -- looking majestic and content as she pursues her world. Someday perhaps it will be one of her offspring that another new falconer partners with as they learn this learn this remarkable art. To Be Continued -- The Art Of:Motorcycles. Pole Dancing. Kindess.
