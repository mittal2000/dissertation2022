With El Tri just minutes from clinching a spot in the quarterfinals of the 2014 World Cup, the Netherlands scored two late goals to flip the scoreline for a 2-1 win in a gripping Round of 16 clash at Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza on Sunday. The Netherlands' rally began in the 88th minute when midfielder Wesley Sneijder scored the equalizer following a corner kick. Soon after Sneijder's right-footed blast beat standout Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, reserve forward Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the winning goal on a penalty kick in stoppage time. The penalty was awarded by referee Pedro Proenca when Dutch striker Arjen Robben went down after contact from Mexico defender Rafael Marquez. Robben had previous, perhaps more substantive, penalty shouts denied earlier in the match but earned a spot kick for the Netherlands in the climactic moment. After the final whistle eliminated his team, Mexico coach Miguel Herrera took a verbal swipe at Robben and the officials in Brazil. ""Three times [Robben] dove,"" Herrera said in Spanish, as translated by ESPN. ""This was a World Cup where everyone was against Mexico all the time.""After a scoreless first half, Mexico grabbed a 1-0 lead early in the 48th minute through Giovani Dos Santos. With Ochoa continuing to make impressive reaction saves as the second half progressed, it looked like that goal would be all that was needed."

Yet millions of children in emerging markets do not. Preliminary results of a ground-breaking new multi-ethnic study, Intergrowth-21st, funded by the Gates Foundation, shows that fetal growth and development is determined more by the social, economic, nutrition and environmental condition of the mother before and during pregnancy rather than the mother's nationality and ethnicity. The Intergrowth-21st findings inspire new insights into how governments, the private sector and civil society globally could level the health, growth, and development playing fields for infants and children from ethnic groups in all countries in the first 1000 days after conception. Today in The Global Search for Education, we shall hear more about the issues and share some of the recommendations offered by the Symposium on Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition in Emerging Markets. It is my pleasure to welcome Sir George Alleyne (Chancellor, University of the West Indies), Tsung-Mei Cheng (Co-founder of the Princeton Conference), Caroline Fall (Professor, International Paediatric Epidemiology, University of Southampton, UK), Governor Madeleine Kunin (Author of The New Feminist Agenda, Defining the Next Revolution for Women, Work and Family), Sania Nishtar (Founder and President, Healthfile, Pakistan), and Srinath Reddy (President, Health Foundation of India). ""The main barriers are a lack of long-term vision and political will - the will to organise the food supply, to educate girls and women, and to build and maintain a skilled and motivated maternal and child health workforce."" -- Caroline FallGovernor Kunin: Can you please summarize the new evidence about the critical importance of the first 1,000 days of life. What are the implications for poor and wealthy nations?There have been dramatic reductions in maternal and infant mortality rates around the world. More lives can be saved if we can harness the research that informs us that the first thousand days of a baby's life are critical to adult well being. Good nutrition and medical care for the mother play a crucial role long before fertilization takes place. No longer can we separate genetics from the environment because a mother's genes may be influenced by malnutrition. The lessons we have learned tell us that the best investments a country can make are in good maternal and infant care. Not only will this save lives; it will help produce a society of healthy and productive adults.Caroline Fall: We know what works for maternal and child health and nutrition (MCHN), and yet there is still a persistent failure of delivery. What are the factors involved?Practically everyone in the world who has a surgical operation gets an effective anaesthetic. This is because anaesthesia is a relatively simple, brief, and direct treatment administered by a well-paid professional, and is of immediate obvious benefit to all concerned. Millions of mothers and children remain malnourished because ensuring good maternal nutrition and excellent pregnancy and child care is complex and takes concerted effort across multiple sectors and over many years. Maternal malnutrition creates few immediate problems, and policy makers may genuinely be ignorant of the far-reaching consequences of the stunting effects on the fetus and infant. They may genuinely be unaware that the child's brain never makes up the deficit and that the child is destined to become a more sickly and unproductive adult. The main barriers are a lack of long-term vision and political will -- the will to organise the food supply, to educate girls and women, and to build and maintain a skilled and motivated maternal and child health workforce. ""Conditional cash transfers, text-message-based initiatives, school-based food programs, vitamin-fortification schemes, and local leadership have all proved effective in improving maternal nutrition."" -- Sania NishtarSania Nishtar: Is maternal and child malnutrition mainly a question of poverty and scarcity of food, poor availability of nutritional foods, or lack of education and poor choices? What is your view of the most effective ways to address the underlying issues?It is a combination of all these factors, although the role played by financial access barriers is the most salient. The impact of factors such as poverty, maternal literacy, sanitation, and housing conditions on children's health and, in turn, on social and economic outcomes, is well documented. The problem is that these factors are not amenable to isolated public-health interventions. But another, less widely discussed social determinant -- maternal nutrition - could be. The good news is that there are solutions. Conditional cash transfers, text-message-based initiatives, school-based food programs, vitamin-fortification schemes, and local leadership have all proved effective in improving maternal nutrition. Such initiatives should be backed by policies that foster positive nutritional choices. Compelling policymakers to implement such policies will require a new set of skills that draws upon lessons from around the world. Initiatives aimed at enhancing the public's knowledge of nutrition are also crucial -- not least because they can motivate citizens to pressure their governments to take action.Tsung-Mei Cheng: As an illustration of the MCHN crisis, what challenges must China address to make significant progress, and what strategies are they currently pursuing?Maternal and child health and nutrition in China have been the major beneficiaries of China's 1978 Reform and Opening. The reform ushered in a period of rapid economic growth of 10 percent a year for most of that period, particularly during 1990-2010. Between 1990 and 2010, infant mortality and under-five years mortality dropped by 70.5 percent and 69.8 percent, respectively, and the prevalence of underweight children by 50 percent. Maternal mortality dropped by 56 percent between 2000 and 2013, and 92 percent of all pregnant women received prenatal care. Significantly, nine-year universal education during this period also vastly raised the ability of the Chinese ""mother,"" chief nurturer of the family, to properly care for her children. Challenges, however, remain. Rural Chinese children, especially those living in poorer inland and western provinces, still bear a disproportionate burden of growth-related problems. Stunting and underweight prevalence in central and western China is two to three times higher than richer eastern China. Rates of stunting and being underweight among the estimated 15 million children of China's vast population of migrant workers who are left behind in the villages are one-and-a-half times those of their non-left-behind counterparts. Moreover, by the Chinese government's own account, the infrastructure to improve rural child nutrition is still fragile, unstable, and vulnerable to changes in economic conditions. Also worrisome are the worsening trends in stunting and underweight prevalence since the 2008 financial crisis, and the toll that environmental pollution has taken and is continuing to take on all Chinese, including children who are more vulnerable to the harms that environmental degradation causes. Looking ahead, China's slower economic growth today, and in the foreseeable future are likely to exacerbate the problems of Chinese children's health and nutrition. Fortunately, China's top policymakers are aware of the problems and have acted on them. For example, in 2011, China's State Council issued the ""Concise Outline of Child Development in China 2011-2020,"" making improvement of maternal and child nutrition an important government mission and part of the 12th five-year plan. The specific goals are to reduce stunting, underweight and anemia prevalence among Chinese children. Some specific measures include strengthening health education and maintenance of women and children including teaching of knowledge about nutrition, and building comprehensive child nutrition monitoring programs. The Chinese government has decided to treat child nutrition improvement as a strategic mission in raising the quality of the Chinese people. ""Substantive impact can only be achieved if the quality of services provided in primary and secondary health care facilities is improved through a supply side response that provides skilled personnel, adequate infrastructure and assured availability of medicines."" -- Srinath ReddySir George Alleyne: How do you see the progress with MCHN compared with progress in other basic human rights, such as literacy, and compared to the progress on major health problems, such as AIDS?Recent years have seen remarkable progress in MCHN both in terms of the science of child growth and development, and in the programs and policies to be applied. There has been renewed and heightened interest in the past decade, partly because of the appreciation of the long term sequelae for health, education, the economy and social services of childhood malnutrition and stunting. There are technologies available for even more rapid advance if only the health services were adequate to deliver them effectively. The progress in this area has been as substantial as in the field of HIV, although the light of popular interest does not shine as brightly on the problems of mothers and children, which do not seem so dramatic.Srinath Reddy: What are the largest MCHN challenges for India, and what strategies are most effective in your view?Despite an accelerated rate of decline over the last decade, India's aggregate national rates of maternal and infant mortality remain higher than those of her economic peers and even of several South Asian neighbors. The present rates (42 per 1000 live births for IMR and 178 per 100000 live births for MMR) fall short of the targets proposed in the Millennium Development Goals of 2000. Hidden within these numbers are huge inequities between different population groups, determined by region, income, education and caste. The high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality are partly responsive to the national program for increasing the demand for institutional deliveries. However, substantive impact can only be achieved if the quality of services provided in primary and secondary health care facilities is improved through a supply side response that provides skilled personnel, adequate infrastructure and assured availability of medicines. Efforts to reduce child mortality under 5 years must improve immunization coverage, sanitation, potable water supply, and primary care for acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. Under-nutrition in childhood (an appalling 42percent) must be reduced not only to protect physical and cognitive growth but also to prevent susceptibility to both childhood infections and chronic diseases in later adulthood.

""Until now, maybe Israel was the first problem in the eyes of many Arabs,"" he said. ""Today, they have to say it openly, the real problem for the Arabs and for us are not the mutual mistrust but really the problem of terror, which is a common danger to them and to us.""Peres said the peace process could be kick-started by the new common enemy. ""We have to take the joint interests, which are many, and didn't exist before,"" he said, proposing ""to establish a functional headquarter of Arab countries and Israel to fight a common danger, because the terrorists are destroying the Arab world. They are the greatest danger to the Arab world, as well as to us a great danger. We have to fight them in order to stop it.""The Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has pledged to take Tel Aviv and Jerusalem,  and to ""liberate Palestine"" as part of its campaign. ""The headquarters would be functional, not territorial, because Hamas or the terrorists don't have a certain place, they don't respect borders, they don't respect law, they are mobile,"" he said, never mentioning ISIS by name. ""We have to fight them in every corner, to search after them in every place they are, to do whatever we can to prevent them before they are killing people.""The Middle East, said Peres, has entered a new phase of history and won't turn back. ""The future is already here. You see the first part of the future, and that is the dismantling of the Middle East as we used to know it. One country falls after another country,"" he said. ""There is a real need to construct a different Middle East. The Middle East must change because the world has changed. And instead of oppositional armies that are fighting usually one against another, now we have a net of terrorists that are trying to destroy everything. They are not two; they are hundreds. They don't have a common ground; they don't have a common future.""Peres was interviewed by a HuffPost blogger as he completed his last official visit to the United States. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who has served in the Israeli government for 67 years, leaves the Israeli presidency in July. Many in Washington, including Supreme Court justices and congressional leaders, came to fete the 90-year-old leader at the Israeli Embassy on Wednesday. The former Israeli prime minister and defense minister was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda on Thursday. Besides Peres, only three other individuals -- Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela and Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi -- have received the trifecta of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.Asked if Israel is willing to risk Israeli lives to protect Jordan if ISIS attacks the kingdom, Peres said that doing so would not be purely a selfless act. ""We are not risking one life for another. We are trying to defend the life of the two of us because we have a common enemy,"" the Israeli president said. Peres, who met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office on Wednesday, praised him during the interview. He said: ""I have the highest respect for Obama. I have worked with 10 American Presidents, both Republicans and Democrats. As far as Israeli security is concerned, he has done the most that an American president can do. We trust, appreciate and are grateful for the support.""He had harsh words for those who say that Obama has not been a friend of Israel. ""The people who make these remarks are gossips. We are living in a world where image-making is important, so we ignore the facts. What counts is his record not the gossips.""He also defended Obama against the critics of his administration's Syria policy. ""When it comes to the Sunnis and Shiites, it is not for the United States or for us or for anyone else to settle who was the heir of Muhammad,"" he said, referring to a long-standing blood feud. ""This is a Muslim and Arab problem and they have to deal with it. I think the best and the right way is to tell the Arab world ... gentlemen, it is your problem and you must find a solution. American soldiers cannot settle a religious problem that is basically Muslim.""In Syria, he said, at least one group has come out a step ahead. ""The Kurds, as a matter of fact, have established their own state. It's a matter of fact,"" he said.Peres also denounced the formation of the Fatah-Hamas Palestinian unity government as ""wrong"" and questioned its long-term viability. He emphatically denied that the Obama administration has recognized the terrorist group Hamas, which the administration's foreign policy critics have charged.""Obama did not recognize Hamas,"" said the Israeli president. ""His position, vis-a-vis Hamas, remains the same. His condemnation of Hamas did not stop him from lauding his friend of 20 years, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as ""a courageous man and a great partner."" He particularly highlighted Abbas' recent speech at the Islamic conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.""For the first time, an Arab leader stood up not outside the Arab world but in the heart of the Arab world, Saudi Arabia. He spoke not in English, not in Hebrew, but in Arabic. He condemned the kidnapping and terror and called for peace. He called for cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian forces to bring an end to terror. Look, it is something unmatched and unprecedented.""Peres, who is known as the eternal optimist for Middle East peace, seemed to want to nudge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to begin peace talks. He said, ""If we have disagreements, the purpose of negotiations is to overcome the disagreements and find common ground."" The Friday morning resignation of U.S. special Middle East envoy Martin Indyk did give the usually sunny idealist pause. He was forced to concede that Indyk's leaving causes the diplomat to be ""not too optimistic"" that any progress can be made in the peace talks. "

Every four years. How often is there a World Cup? Every four years."" And if Americans were still not convinced of the liberal soccer and World Cup conspiracy and of how un-American, subversive and unpatriotic soccer is -- the growing interest in the sport being ""a sign of the nation's moral decay"" -- they just had to read the nine-point manifesto by another expert on the American psyche, Ann Coulter.Among Coulter's most brilliant points:There is no accountability in soccer, little self-expression, not much prospect for personal humiliation, for personal disgrace or major injury (""After a soccer game, every player gets a ribbon and a juice box"") and, God forbid, girls can play with boys in soccer. For all these reasons, Liberal moms -- ""soccer moms"" -- love this sport, Coulter suggests.Coulter buttresses her warning that the growing interest in soccer is a sign of our nation's moral decay with the facts that soccer ""is foreign... the French like it,"" it is ""like the metric system"" and, worst of all, ""You can't use your hands in soccer.""But Coulter saves her most eloquent and compelling point, and hope, for last:If more 'Americans' are watching soccer today, it's only because of the demographic switch affected by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 immigration law. I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time.Keith Ablow and Ann Coulter are not the first to warn Americans about the growing evil influence and moral decay represented by that fureign game of soccer and, every four years, by that pagan, un-American spectacle, the so-called World Cup.As the 2010 World Cup began in South Africa, conservative media figures attacked the tournament, soccer and used them as ""a proxy to attack President Obama and progressives.""Courtesy Mediamatters.org, June 11, 2010, by Oliver Willis:Glenn Beck: ""Barack Obama's policies are the World Cup."" In an extensive rant on the June 11 Glenn Beck Program, Beck purported to explain how President Obama's policies ""are the World Cup"" of ""political thought."" Beck stated, ""It doesn't matter how you try to sell it to us, it doesn't matter how many celebrities you get, it doesn't matter how many bars open early, it doesn't matter how many beer commercials they run, we don't want the World Cup, we don't like the World Cup, we don't like soccer, we want nothing to do with it."" Beck stated that likewise, ""the rest of the world likes Barack Obama's policies, we do not.""Beck added ""those who like the World Cup... they're the most likely to riot,"" commenting that by contrast, ""I haven't seen the baseball riots."" He later said of soccer, ""I hate it so much, probably because the rest of the world likes it so much, and they riot over it, and they continually try to jam it down our throat.""G. Gordon Liddy: ""Whatever happened to American exceptionalism?"" Discussing soccer's popularity in the U.S. on his June 10 program, G. Gordon Liddy asked, ""Whatever happened to American exceptionalism?"" Liddy noted that ""this game... originated with the South American Indians and instead of a ball, they used to use the head, the decapitated head, of an enemy warrior.""MRC's Dan Gainor: Also on the June 10 G. Gordon Liddy Show, Media Research Center's Dan Gainor said, ""the problem here is, soccer is designed as a poor man or poor woman's sport"" and that ""the left is pushing it in schools across the country."" He added: ""generally football games in this country don't devolve into riots or wars."" He later added that the sport of soccer ""is being sold"" as necessary due to the ""browning of America.""Read more here.And please read Paul Vale's point-by-point rebuttal of Coulter's silly manifesto here, and root and wave those American flags for Team USA playing against Belgium on Tuesday -- the team that according to Coulter, represents ""a sign of the nation's moral decay.""Prove her wrong!"

Looking above at recent temperature anomalies, much of the US is experiencing warmer than average temperatures; the east Pacific warm spot still prevents much rain from reaching California. Much of the Arctic Sea surrounding the North Pole is experiencing much warmer than normal temperatures - not good news for our Arctic thermal shield of ice, which is predicted to shrink further in 2014 (see below).

""It's a showdown between humanity and barbarian savagery.""ISIL Sunni militants have seized a broad swath of territory in northern and western Iraq in recent weeks in their quest to topple the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shi'ite, and set up a classic Islamic caliphate.Deeming Shi'ites to be heretics, ISIL militants have posted videos showing executions of government troops upon capture. Iranian media are rife with reports of other atrocities allegedly committed by ISIL.Disgruntled Iraqi Sunnis accuse Maliki of excluding them from power, which has prompted some Sunni tribes and former Saddam loyalists to join ISIL's armed rebellion.Iran is a close ally of Maliki and its official reaction has been guarded as the ruling clergy sought to play down the idea of a showdown between Shi'ites and Sunnis, who make up the overwhelming majority in the Muslim world.In his speech, Khamenei characterized the events in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East as a Western conspiracy.Last week, Khamenei said he opposed intervention in Iraq by the United States or any other country to stop ISIL. President Barack Obama has said he would not send ground forces back to Iraq, limiting assistance to military advisers, intelligence and surveillance operations.

Muslim women are not permitted to marry Christian men under the Islamic laws that Sudan applies.""The talks now are aiming to get her out of Sudan on a Sudanese passport,"" the source said.South Sudan, which has a majority Christian population, became independent from the mostly Muslim north after a referendum in 2011 that ended years of civil war.Ibrahim's case has been closely monitored by Washington and London, which last month summoned the Sudanese charge d'affaires to protest against Ibrahim's initial death sentence and urged Sudan to uphold its international obligations on freedom of religion and belief.A U.S. spokeswoman said on Thursday before Ibrahim's release that Ibrahim had all the documents she needed to travel to the United States.The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Sudan since 1997 over alleged human rights violations. It intensified sanctions in 2006 over Khartoum's actions in its conflict with rebels in the western region of Darfur.

The agency says the regulation would not protect any new waters, but rather clarify waters, such as streams and wetlands, that are already protected under current law.Republicans like Barrasso, however, view the move as another example of federal overreach that threatens local land use and zoning.""Federal regulations have never defined ditches and other upland drainage features as 'waters of the U.S.,'"" Barrasso said, according to the  Casper Star-Tribune. ""But this proposed rule does, and it will have a huge impact on farmers, on ranchers, on small businesses that need to put a shovel in the ground to make a living.""In 2012, Barrasso joined Sens.

21,POLITICS,Sex and the Constitution: Why Lawyers Aren't Asking the Right Questions,"Mark Olmsted, ContributorAuthor, Speaker, Editor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-and-the-constitution_b_5538332.html,"If the right to get married -- though not specifically mentioned by the founding fathers -- is deemed fundamental to unfettered human experience, wouldn't the same argument be made in regards to physical intimacy?",2014-06-28,Emergency contraception. Woman taking the morning-after pill. Her partner is behind her.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce4e2400005100577071.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Watching some of the recent and unfortunate internecine battling about HBO's Prop 8 documentary, (shame on you, Andrew Sullivan) I can't help thinking how unsophisticated the legal arguments around it will appear in a few decades. Not because gay people getting married will be ubiquitous and yawn-inducing, but because new questions will have emerged: Why should the state be involved in recognizing marriage at all? Why should anybody, gay or straight, have increased status and rights because they are sexually and romantically involved with each other? How does this not create a marital apartheid, where those who choose to remain single, are divorced, or simply have not found the ""right"" person, are deprived of the ""plus-one"" benefits they could use with friends and relatives instead of a spouse? After all, marriage isn't even mentioned in the Constitution; equal process under the law is. I recognize most of the United States is not ""ready"" for this kind of thinking. Even the most anti-gay justices -- and certainly the pro-Prop 8 defenders -- did not challenge the idea that marriage itself is an indispensable component of ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" It is just one of many implied rights not spelled out in the Constitution that are now considered ""constitutional"" (like the right to privacy).But what about the right to sex? Why, if the right to get married -- though not specifically mentioned by the founding fathers -- is deemed fundamental to unfettered human experience, wouldn't the same argument be made in regards to physical intimacy? Why isn't this right being specifically articulated in the current lawsuits pitting religious freedom against access to reproductive choice?Another right not spelled out in the Bill of Rights, but virtually uncontested, is that human beings should not have to procreate if they don't want to. We can see this reflected in the exception carved out for cases of rape in so many abortion statutes: if a woman did not engage in consensual sex, it is mostly agreed she should not be forced to bear that child. Similarly, there is no proscription against the celibate. By extension, we can claim another unspecified right as ""constitutional"": the right to abstinence.Unfortunately, abstinence is also the only 100 percent surefire method to avoid pregnancy. Condoms break, IUDs fail, doses of the pill can be unintentionally skipped. It would also be disingenuous to ignore the source of a lot of unplanned pregnancy -- impulsive moments fueled by passion, alcohol or both. This is the nature of human sexuality. We don't always weigh potential consequences when the desire to please or be pleased takes hold.So we have these facts that can easily be stipulated in court:1. The only certain method of pregnancy prevention is abstinence.2. If a woman chooses to have sex with non-procreational intent, she needs to use contraception.3. Some women, as a matter of financial reality, will not have access to contraception or abortion if it is not covered by health insurance.4. All women for whom contraception and abortion are not covered by insurance cannot exercise concurrent rights to both sexual intimacy and the certainty of not having to bear a child.This begs a truly basic question that remains unposed before the court: Do women have a constitutional right to have sex? The de-facto reality is that men already do, because even if intercourse results in pregnancy, they do not bear the child and are rarely forced to take responsibility for it if they don't want to. Many mothers prefer no father to an unwilling one, or become attached to someone else.  At present, the lawyers for the Justice Department are being sucked into arguing the case on Hobby Lobby's terms: as an issue of religious freedom. While this may be a thinly-veiled camouflage of familiar cultural clashes of the past century, they do have in their favor that ""freedom of religion"" is spelled out in the Bill of Rights. Truly creative legal minds would piggyback on the continued expansion of rights not specifically delineated in the Constitution, but increasingly understood as part of ""the pursuit of happiness"" for the vast majority of Americans. They need to ask the justices if the urge to be intimate and the choice not to have offspring are every bit as essential to fundamental notions of liberty as a belief that the biblical sanction to ""be fruitful and multiply"" gives an employer the right to edit the medical coverage of his employees."
