2,FOOD & DRINK,One Great Passover (and Gluten-free) Cake Two Ways,"Jamie Schler, Contributor
Writer specializing in food and culture",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-great-passover-and-gl_us_5b9df6d8e4b03a1dcc8fa18e,"I was determined to create a cake that one-ups the old-fashioned, traditional Passover sponge cake.",2014-04-07,2014-04-05-CocoaEspressoAlmondPassoverSpongeCakeI1.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-05-CocoaEspressoAlmondPassoverSpongeCakeI1-thumb.JPG,"Passover is upon us and as we clean out the house and kitchen, get rid of all wheat and grain products, as we lock our flour, yeast and baking powder away with so many of our other baking products, we ponder what sweet treats and desserts we can serve our family over the eight days of the holiday. Special meals, the Passover Seder, followed by a week of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snack times have us combing through blogs and old Sisterhood Cookbooks for new recipes and ideas of how to keep the family happy. Am I right? Cooking and eating during Passover is a meticulous, studied affair, and many of us go out of our way to prepare special foods. The rules concerning what is to be eaten and, more importantly, what cannot be eaten by Jews for the duration of the 8-day festival is extremely strict. Jews are forbidden to eat chometz, any food containing barley, wheat, rye, oats, and spelt. For many Jews, corn, millet, rice, beans and lentils are off limits, too. Food cannot be leavened, so no yeast, baking powder or baking soda, which makes baking -- and keeping the family happily supplied with cake -- tricky. Especially those of us who are home bakers or who do not have a kosher bakery or shop nearby. But after many years, I do have a repertoire of some great recipes, including a Chocolate Chestnut Fondant (omitting the flour), Strawberry Mascarpone Cheesecake, Chocolate Almond Torte and Chocolate Espresso Pecan Torte. This year, I wanted something light, more delicate; I was determined to create a cake that one-ups the old-fashioned, traditional Passover sponge cake, that inimitable standby, that emblematic myth of the holiday. Usually store bought. Usually dry. Usually flavorless.I developed a Passover-friendly and gluten free sponge cake, and have created both a lemon and a chocolate espresso version of this light, delicate yet satisfying almond cake. Baking the sponge in a narrower, taller pan (7 ¼ inch-diameter x 4 inch-high) made for a dizzyingly tall and very impressive cake. Be extra careful when unmolding as the top of the cake is crispy and flaky; it is best to use a springform pan so you can just lift off the sides then loosen and slide it from the bottom onto a serving platter. I did partially cool the cake upside down (which I often do for sponges as it helps keep them from sinking), placing a cool rack upside down on the top of the pan and slowly flipping it upside down.COCOA ESPRESSO ALMOND PASSOVER SPONGE CAKE (gluten free)Whether you celebrate the Jewish festival of Passover or not, this cake is a splendid addition to your baking repertoire and your table. Made without flour, it is a wonderful, tasty gluten-free treat as well.4 large eggs, separated 1 cup (200 g) sugar 1/4 cup (65 ml) prepared strong coffee 1/4 tsp vanilla extract 1/2 cup (45 g) ground almonds 1/2 cup (90 g) potato flour * 1/4 cup (25 g) unsweetened cocoa powder * Pinch salt + few drops lemon juice for whites Handful slivered blanched almonds to decorate, optional* I use what is called fecule de pomme de terre, potato flour but has the consistency more of a light cornstarch than flour. Try finding potato flour but if you cannot find it then try potato starch. When measuring both the potato flour and the cocoa powder, lightly scoop and spoon each into a measuring cup then scrape off the excess with the flat side of a knife blade. Do not pack into the cup.(For the Lemon version: omit the prepared coffee and the cocoa powder. Instead, add finely grated zest and juice from ½ lemon, beating both into the thickened yolk/sugar mixture with the vanilla.)Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Have ready a springform pan -- I used a 7 1/4 inch-diameter x 4 inch-high springform but a regular 8-inch pan (with high sides) is fine, too, simply adjust baking time. Separate the eggs; place the yolks in a large mixing bowl and the whites in a medium bowl, preferably plastic or metal. Add a pinch salt and a few drops lemon juice to the whites and set aside.Using an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks for a couple of minutes until thick and pale. Add the sugar and continue beating until thick and creamy. Beat in the prepared coffee and the vanilla extract until well blended and thick. Quickly beat in the ground almonds.Using very clean beaters, beat the egg whites on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase the speed to high; beat the whites until thick, glossy and peaks hold. Do not overbeat until the whites are dry. Using a spatula, gently but firmly fold the stiff whites into the lemon almond cake batter in 3 additions. Sift the cocoa powder onto the potato flour and stir together; fold in the potato flour/cocoa mixture with the third addition of the whites in order to avoid overworking the batter. Fold in the whites just until all the lumps of white have disappeared.Gently pour the batter into the springform pan. Dust with a couple of tablespoons slivered almonds. Bake in the preheated oven 30 - 45 minutes, depending on your oven and pan size. The cake is done when puffed, set and golden. Gently press on the top of the cake and it should feel set, much like an angel or sponge cake. A tester inserted in the center should come out dry.Remove the pan from the oven onto a cooling rack and allow to cool to before unmolding, but carefully run a long, thin blade around the sides to loosen the cake while still warm. Be extra careful when unmolding as the top of the cake is crispy and flakey; it is best to use a springform pan so you can just lift off the sides then loosen and slide it from the bottom onto a serving platter. I did partially cool the cake upside down (which I often do for sponges as it helps keep them from sinking), placing a cool rack upside down on the top of the pan and slowly flipping it upside down.Jamie Schler lives, eats and writes in France.

3,WELLNESS,Engineer Involved In Fatal Metro-North Train Derailment Had Undiagnosed Sleep Apnea,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sleep-apnea-metro-north-train-engineer-william-rockefeller_us_5b9df700e4b03a1dcc8fa874,"Symptoms of sleep apnea are often not very specific, meaning not everyone who feels tired during the day or who snores at",2014-04-07,"FOR USE AS DESIRED, YEAR END PHOTOS - FILE - First responders work the scene of a derailment of a Metro-North passenger train in the Bronx borough of New York Sunday, Dec. 1, 2013. The train derailed on a curved section of track in the Bronx, coming to rest just inches from the water and causing multiple fatalities and dozens of injuries, authorities said. Metropolitan Transportation Authority police say the train derailed near the Spuyten Duyvil station. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df70026000032008013af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Train engineer William Rockefeller, who ""zoned out"" while at the controls of a Metro-North train in New York in December when it derailed, resulting in the deaths of four people and injuries of more than 70, had undiagnosed severe sleep apnea, according to news reports.The New York Times reported that the sleep disorder -- which is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime fatigue -- was made worse by his recent change in shifts, to work in the early morning. While sleep apnea affects at least one in four men and one in 10 women, most people with the condition -- as many as 80 percent -- are undiagnosed, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Sleep apnea has been linked with a number of health ills -- including diabetes, obesity and heart disease -- and it also carries a huge financial cost. A 1999 study in the journal Sleep showed that untreated sleep apnea in the U.S. is associated with as much as $3.4 billion in additional medical costs. Sleep apnea is notoriously dangerous for people in transportation-related industries in particular, since the condition causes daytime fatigue. Pilots, for instance, are required to undergo sleep apnea screening by the Federal Aviation Administration. And while truck driving rules from the U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration don't address sleep apnea specifically, they do state that any condition that would impair ability to drive safely must be treated before the driver can regain ""medically-qualified-to-drive"" status. Symptoms of sleep apnea are often not very specific, meaning not everyone who feels tired during the day or who snores at night has sleep apnea, notes the University of Maryland Medical Center. However, a doctor may recommend evaluation by a sleep specialist when sleepiness starts to affect quality of life or others' well-being/safety, or if someone has noticed pauses in breathing during sleep.Sleep apnea diagnosis involves undergoing a sleep study, which includes a number of tests. The most popular test, a polysomnogram, involves the recording of heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, eye movements, blood oxygen levels, air movement through the nose, snoring and chest movements during sleep. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute notes that if a doctor suspects sleep apnea, he or she might try putting the patient on a CPAP machine (CPAP stands for continuous positive airway pressure, considered the gold standard treatment for sleep apnea), for half a night while the patient is undergoing a sleep study.

CARBON CAPTURESaskatchewan Power in Canada will open a $1.35 billion coal-fired electricity generating plant this year that will extract a million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from its exhaust gases - the first carbon capture and storage plant of its type.Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the group meeting in Berlin, will help governments, which aim to agree a deal to slow climate change at a Paris summit in December 2015. Few nations have outlined plans consistent with staying below 2 degrees C.Another report by the IPCC last week in Japan showed warming already affects every continent and would damage food and water supplies and slow economic growth. It may already be having irreversible impacts on the Arctic and coral reefs.The new draft shows that getting on track to meet the 2C goal would mean limiting greenhouse gas emissions to between 30 and 50 billion tonnes in 2030, a radical shift after a surge to 49 billion tonnes in 2010 from 38 billion in 1990.The shift would educe economic output by between 2-6 percent by 2050, because of the costs of building a cleaner energy system based on low-carbon energies that are more expensive than abundant coal, the IPCC said. Capturing carbon dioxide is also expensive, it added.China and the United States are the top emitters.One option is to let temperatures overshoot the 2C target while developing technology to cool the planet by extracting greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, the draft says. The draft that would add to risks of warming and push up costs.Extracting carbon from nature includes simple measures such as planting more trees, which soak up carbon as they grow, or capturing and burying greenhouse gases from electricity-generating plants that burn wood or other plant matter.A problem is that markets for trading carbon dioxide focus on cuts in emissions at power plants and factories burning fossil fuels, not renewable energies which are viewed as green.""In Europe there is no incentive"" said Jonas Helseth, director of environmental group Bellona Europe who chairs a group of scientists and industry experts looking at burying emissions from renewable energy.The IPCC draft report is the third and final study in a U.N. series about climate change, updating findings from 2007, after the Japan report about the impacts and one in September in Sweden about climate science.The September report raised the probability that human actions, led by the use of fossil fuels, are the main cause of climate change since 1950 to at least 95 percent from 90. But opinion polls show voters are unpersuaded, with many believing that natural variations are the main cause. (Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Andrew Heavens)"
