0,POLITICS,Imagining The World With A Nuclear-Armed Donald Trump Is Truly Terrifying,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nuclear-armed-donald-trump_us_57a22a94e4b0e1aac9143474,Anybody who knows anything about nukes is unsettled by the idea of Trump having access to them.,2016-08-03,"Hotheadedness and nukes don't mix, Trump's critics say.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a245df13000029007c2c32.jpeg?cache=wvqacERIsn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MIT professor emeritus and progressive icon Noam Chomsky says the prospect of a President Donald Trump with access to the nuclear launch codes should terrify anyone who cares about the future of humanity.That’s partially because nobody, perhaps including Trump himself, has any clue what he’d do with that power.“Trump’s expressed views tell us nothing,” Chomsky told The Huffington Post, referencing the GOP presidential candidate’s wildly inconsistent claims on various policy issues. “But the idea that someone with such personal characteristics could have his finger on the button should terrify people who care about the future.”The Huffington Post interviewed Chomsky before Wednesday’s news that Trump was reportedly unaware of ― or unconcerned with ― the concept of mutually assured destruction, and had repeatedly asked an unnamed foreign policy expert why the U.S. can’t use its nuclear arsenal.This mindset directly undercuts a key principle of nuclear deterrence, which holds that governments with nukes won’t actually use them because doing so would ensure catastrophic retaliation and possibly end the human race.Trump’s campaign has since denied the claims that MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough initially made about this conversation. But they are consistent with what many experts see as Trump’s history of making deeply troubling remarks about nuclear arms.Chomsky cited a chilling piece by Bruce Blair, a nuclear safety expert and scholar at Princeton University, who earlier this year outlined what it might be like with Trump’s finger on “the button.”With thousands of warheads at its disposal, the office of the United States presidency is now a “nuclear monarchy,” explains Blair. The commander in chief has “virtually unlimited power to rain down nuclear weapons on any adversarial regime and country at any time” which could extinguish “hundreds of millions of lives” in just a few hours. There’s also the possibility of that proverbial 3 a.m. call giving notice that a nuclear strike is imminent, writes Blair. With just 30 minutes to deal with missiles launched from Russia or China (and 12 minutes or less for missiles launched from submarines in the Atlantic Ocean), the president must have the brainpower and steadiness to confront such a crisis.We now have to ask if Trump is fit to manage any of these frighteningly real scenarios. Chomsky says no. Not just no, but hell no. “Trump and the [party] are loud and clear: We must race to the precipice as quickly as possible,” he said. “That alone is enough to disqualify them from holding any office, and it’s just for starters.”Maybe that’s no surprise coming from Chomsky, who has previously said the GOP poses “literally a serious danger to human survival” due to the party’s denial of climate change. But nonpartisan nuclear experts, as well as Trump’s conservative critics, have voiced similar concerns.Former CIA Director Michael Hayden expressed discomfort on Wednesday about Trump’s ability to muster the “speed and decisiveness” needed to determine whether to use nuclear weapons. For that reason and others, Hayden, a Republican, said he couldn’t picture himself voting for Trump.John Noonan, a Republican national security expert who advised former GOP presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, expressed profound alarm over the prospect of a nuclear-armed Trump.Nuclear weapons experts have also expressed anxiety over the possibility of a possible President Trump, citing his recent remarks.“Widespread, bipartisan concerns about Trump’s personality and character, coupled with some irresponsible and uninformed statements he has made about the inevitability and desirability of proliferation and the role and purpose of nuclear weapons, are real cause for worry,” Kingston Reif, director of disarmament and threat reduction policy for Arms Control Association, told HuffPost.In March, Trump refused to rule out using tactical nuclear weapons in the war against the self-described Islamic State. He later sounded unconcerned by the use of nuclear weaponry, going so far as to ask why the U.S. had nuclear weapons if it couldn’t use them. Trump also wouldn’t rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe.“Questions about Trump’s fitness to be commander in chief are an illustration that deterrence is not foolproof,” Reif said. “Cooler heads may not always prevail.”Though Trump’s list of public spats and embarrassing feuds appears to have no end in sight, the onetime reality television star has responded to detractors by saying he has “one of the best temperaments.” And while Trump has said it’s “highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely” that he would ever use nuclear weapons, he’s also made a point of keeping his options open.Nukes and hotheadedness simply don’t mix, and the constant questions about Trump’s disposition should be a wake-up call to voters, said former Rep. John Tierney (D-Mass.), executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.“It is imperative that the next president is tempered enough to carefully manage and navigate a potential nuclear crisis situation,” Tierney added. “The world’s safety and security literally weighs in the balance.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
1,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Campaign Chair Insists Everything Is Fine,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-trump-turmoil_us_57a218cfe4b0104052a0a203,"“The candidate is in control of his campaign,"" Paul Manafort said.",2016-08-03,Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort says the campaign is going well.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a2234d2a0000fa01fb474a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, pushed back against reports of turmoil within the Republican nominee’s campaign on Wednesday, accusing Hillary Clinton’s campaign of spreading a false narrative.“The candidate is in control of his campaign. That’s number one, and I’m in control of doing the things he wants me to do in the campaign,” Manafort said in an interview on Fox News.“The turmoil, this is another Clinton narrative that she put out there and that the media is picking up on,” he added, describing the campaign as “in very good shape” after reportedly raising $82 million in July ― its best month yet.The campaign careened off the rails over the weekend after the Trump picked a fight with the Gold Star parents of a slain Muslim American war hero. Ignoring aides and prominent GOP members, he doubled down by saying he didn’t “regret anything” about critiquing the family.The real estate mogul didn’t stop there, however, racking up an astonishing number of controversies in the last 48 hours that threatened to disintegrate his already shaky support among elected officials in his party.Trump refused to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in their primary campaigns, angering Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, who was reportedly so “apoplectic” at the move he called the candidate to urge him to change course. He drew the ire of military veterans at a campaign event in Virginia by telling a Purple Heart recipient that he “always wanted” to get the medal. At the same event, he ordered a crying baby to be carried out of the room. He also said he feared the November election would be “rigged” against him, without providing any evidence ― a dangerous assertion that could delegitimize the outcome.“Well, I just hear things,” Trump said when asked to provide proof. “And I just feel it and I felt it having to do with the primaries.”The candidate’s actions seemed to be taking a toll on his campaign staff, who were reportedly “suicidal”:Manafort denied Harwood’s report, but some of his close friends described him as being “frustrated” by his inability to manage Trump in any sense, according to HuffPost’s Howard Fineman.As talk of potentially replacing Trump on the ticket percolated among some GOP officials, NBC News reported that top Trump endorsers were considering holding an intervention with the candidate in hopes of righting the ship. Among those involved, per NBC, are Priebus, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.While Manafort dismissed the NBC report during his Wednesday interview, he did not explicitly deny the possibility of an intervention in coming days.“This is the first I’m hearing of that,” he said. “The only need we have for intervention is maybe for some media types who keep saying things that aren’t true.”Trump’s inability to stay on message in the last few days even worried Gingrich, a supporter and surrogate who was nearly named Trump’s presidential running mate. “The current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable, because right now neither of them is acceptable,” Gingrich told the Washington Post on Wednesday. “Trump is helping her to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "
2,BUSINESS,Walmart's Latest Move In Its War To Overtake Amazon,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walmart-jet-amazon_us_57a216e0e4b04414d1f2e098,Walmart is going shopping.,2016-08-03,"An employee collects items for customer orders at the Jet.com Inc. fulfillment center in Kansas City, Kansas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a22e7c2a00002e004f8247.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Walmart struggles with slumping sales, the company may be in talks to buy Jet.com, the ambitious e-commerce startup launched last year.The potential deal is valued at up to $3 billion, though Jet is valued at less than half that, according to a Wednesday report in The Wall Street Journal. Acquiring Jet would spur Walmart’s online efforts as it tries to catch up to online retail behemoth Amazon.Walmart declined to comment on this story. Jet did not respond to requests for a statement.Walmart spent $3.8 billion over the past year to boost sales, particularly online, as its overall sales failed to grow for the first time in 46 years. In May, the retail giant reported quarterly e-commerce sales growth at just 7 percent, down from 17 percent in the same time period last year. Compare that to Amazon’s 31 percent sales growth in the last quarter, up from 20 percent a year earlier.In other words, Walmart has a long way to go before it can challenge Amazon online. But Jet could help. The New Jersey-based startup has seen impressive growth since its July 2015 launch. Between September and December, average monthly sales grew by 28 percent, according to a white paper from the research firm Slice Intelligence. Jet’s possible acquisition by Walmart drew criticism from some who see selling it barely a year after launch as a bailout to make investors whole before the company falters. In its report, The Wall Street Journal noted that a sale “would mark a disappointing end to one of the most ambitious challengers to Amazon.”Jet set out last year to tackle Amazon by channeling Costco’s membership model and tweaking its delivery system to beat the e-commerce juggernaut with cheaper prices. By pulling in revenue through membership fees and pairing customers with the cheapest possible shipping methods, Jet said it could drastically lower prices.In October, three months after its launch, Jet dropped its $50 annual membership fee and kicked off an aggressive advertising campaign in hopes of luring more shoppers. The startup claimed it could keep prices low by subsidizing them with sales commissions it collected from third-party merchants on the site. The site billed itself as a destination for shoppers buying home goods in bulk. In that sense, it worked. Buying laundry detergent, paper towels, toothpaste and coffee cost much less on Jet than Amazon, according to a report by Money magazine, which estimated monthly shoppers could save up to $500 a year.Yet, Jet’s sales still represent less than 1 percent of Amazon’s sales. And integrating the company with Walmart may not be easy. For years, Walmart’s technology efforts were fractured, with one team at the headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, and the more experimental @WalmartLabs at a chic Silicon Valley office in San Bruno, California. In January, the company moved to combine the teams, creating a new unit called Walmart Technology, with about 8,000 workers. It’s unclear whether Walmart would keep Jet as a standalone site, or if it would integrate the company’s complex back-end technology into its own Walmart.com."
3,POLITICS,Runaway Trump Train Picks Up Speed As Aides Can't Grab The Controls,Howard Fineman and S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/runaway-trump-unmanageable_us_57a15f8de4b08a8e8b600c89,"Paul Manafort isn’t quitting, but is said to be “frustrated.” The RNC is distancing itself. Even Trump's kids seem powerless.",2016-08-03,"Donald Trump, flanked by campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka, checks the podium at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 20.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a1671b2a00002e004f7fec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s campaign chairman, has had success dealing with hard-to-manage dictatorial types, from Imelda Marcos of the Philippines to Jonas Savimbi of Angola to Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine.But he is described by close friends as “frustrated” beyond measure by his inability to manage Trump in any sense.Reince Priebus, the pliable chair of the Republican National Committee, went to extraordinary lengths to legitimize Trump ― but now the RNC is throwing up its hands and distancing itself.Even longtime Trump friends ― he does have a few, such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ― are shaking their heads at what they regard as his self-destructive knack for saying awful things at the worst times.And insiders say Trump’s children ― said to be a moderating influence at times ― have neither the political knowledge nor the clout with their dad to restrain him, assuming that they indeed want to.In all, the world of Republican operatives, insiders and elected officials has concluded ― rather too late in the game ― that Trump is an unmanageable mess who can only win the presidency if Julian Assange, Vladimir Putin or a prosecutor somewhere destroys Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.“This election is going to be decided by outside events,” said a patient but perhaps overly optimistic Trump adviser. “If, that is, we can figure out how to get the candidate to use them.”In a text to The Huffington Post, Manafort flatly denied the essence of a tweet by respected CNBC and New York Times reporter John Harwood saying Manafort had given up on the campaign, and said campaign spokesman Jason Miller would soon release a statement. Miller, a few minutes later, tweeted: But Manafort’s friends and allies confirmed that he is “frustrated” by Trump’s refusal to seek advice ― or listen to it if offered ― as he sends out cascades of disastrous tweets and Facebook posts.“The problem is that Trump watches TV every minute that he isn’t actually on his phone, either talking or tweeting,” said one adviser. “And then he gets angry at what he sees on TV and reacts.“But I don’t think Manafort will quit,” the adviser said. “He’s come too far for too long in this business to stop now, no matter how frustrating. There is nothing Paul can do.”Another member of Manafort’s circle described Trump in unflattering terms and said that while Manafort is there for the duration, he is counting the days.In effect, Manafort’s allies are distancing their friend from the mess he is part of.According to sources close to the campaign, it took longtime buddies Giuliani and Tom Barrack to convince Trump to stop his attacks on the Gold Star Khan family.The same distancing is going on at the RNC.Priebus’ response to Trump’s feud with the Khan family, for example, was to state on CNN: “I think this family should be off limits.”And Tuesday, in response to a HuffPost query about Trump’s statements questioning the legitimacy of the country’s elections, the committee suggested posing the question to Trump’s campaign, instead. “I would ask the campaign to clarify what they mean,” said RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters.Trump’s post-convention bender has put his party leadership in a nearly impossible situation. For weeks before Cleveland, Republican National Committee officials pushed the idea that Trump would unify the party at the convention and come out ready to take on Clinton.But after a rocky convention that included a prime-time speech from a rival who refused to endorse Trump and his own wife’s plagiarized remarks, party officials were privately explaining the difficulties in dealing with their nominee.Trump does not take well to criticism, one official said, so any critique has to be prefaced with lavish praise ― as if dealing with a child.One RNC member told HuffPost on condition of anonymity that Priebus routinely tells members that he frequently must “talk Trump down from a ledge,” and that the campaign would be in even worse shape if he didn’t.Another RNC member could only offer: “What do you want us to say?”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The stunning move, as a jury in a criminal case against Pacific Gas & Electric deliberated for a fourth day, means the company now faces a maximum federal fine of $6 million, instead of $562 million, if it is convicted in one of the worst disasters of its kind in history. The jury is considering 13 criminal charges stemming from the blowout and fire that destroyed 38 homes in suburban San Bruno. Pursuing the half-billion-dollar fine would have required prosecutors to present the jury with complicated instructions to determine how much the utility had saved by breaking safety regulations, according to The Mercury News.The court filing didn’t explain why prosecutors abandoned that strategy. But the move surprised officials representing San Bruno, a suburb south of San Francisco.“There may be a reason based on legal strategy to seek severely diminished fines if PG&E is found guilty in this trial,” said state Sen. Jerry Hill (D), who represents the area. “But for many, myself included, there is no reason that can justify this move when weighed against lives of the eight people who perished when the PG&E pipeline in San Bruno exploded in September 2010 ― after PG&E repeatedly put its profits ahead of public safety and service.” Prosecutors have accused the utility of violating federal pipeline safety regulations and keeping inaccurate records. Engineers and company officials knowingly increased pressure in aging pipelines and failed to conduct expensive tests, according to testimony in the trial. PG&E then obstructed the federal investigation into the blast, according to the office of U.S. Attorney Brian Stretch.Stretch’s office didn’t respond to The Huffington Post’s inquiries Tuesday.“Regardless of this action or the next legal steps, we want our customers and their families to know that we are committed to re-earning their trust by acting with integrity and working around the clock to provide them with energy that is safe, reliable, affordable and clean,” a PG&E spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday. PG&E has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Defense attorneys contend no one at the company deliberately sidestepped safety measures.San Bruno City Manager Connie Jackson said securing a guilty verdict is more important than the size of the fine. “Not being subject to the potential $500-million-plus fine can look like giving PG&E a pass,” Jackson said. “But we’re not critical of the prosecutor for doing what he did today.“We are interested in a guilty verdict that will remain a black mark on the seal of PG&E that will be an inducement for them and the industry to increase safety,” Jackson said. California’s Public Utilities Commission imposed a record fine of $1.6 billion on PG&E in September for the blast."

9,THE WORLDPOST,Brazil's Military Will Be Deployed To Guard Rio Tourist Sites,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rio-olympics-military-brazil_us_57a1eb2be4b08a8e8b601ec7,Focus turns to security around tourist sites and stadiums ahead of the Games.,2016-08-03,Brazilian Army soldiers patrol in front of the Olympic park ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a1ed5113000029007c2a8c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil said on Tuesday it was deploying the military to patrol the emblematic tourist sites in Rio de Janeiro to guard against the “minimal” chance of an attack, though security at the Olympic stadium appeared slack three days before the Games.Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes said deploying the military to the Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf Mountain would free up police to patrol other areas of the city during the Games, which run from Aug. 5 to Aug. 21.Speaking at the inauguration of the center for international police cooperation, which allows countries competing in the Games to share information on security threats, Moraes said agents with handheld metal detectors would check visitors to the Christ the Redeemer statue, which sits atop the Corcovado mountain at the center of the city.“The two (tourist) points where we’ll deploy the armed forces are Corcovado and the Sugarloaf Mountain,” Moraes told reporters.The military will also patrol strategic points in Rio such as energy, water and telecommunications installations, airports and tram stations.Concerns over possible attacks at the Games jumped last month after Brazil detained 12 people on suspicion of links to the Islamic State militant group. Police said they were monitoring some 100 suspected Islamist militants, particularly in the porous southern border region with Paraguay and Argentina.However, the minister said that the chances of any attack were “minimal.”The security operation for the Games will include a total of 85,000 police and soldiers.However, at the main Olympic stadium on Tuesday, an X-ray machine to scan visitors was not connected and there was no bar code scanner to check Olympic accreditation.Organizers last week canceled the contract of the relatively unknown security firm, Artel, which was supposed to check credentials and bags at the entrance to stadiums, replacing them with military police reservists.“As the people who were going to do this service are not here, the machine is turned off,” said one reservist, who asked not to be identified, standing beside a metal detector. “We are going to see if by tomorrow they turn it on.”A Reuters reporter was able to walk around the Engenhao stadium, visiting the changing rooms and other areas, without any restrictions. The minister said that security would be tightened on Wednesday.“We have already incorporated 2,000 of the 3,400 expected agents and we have until tomorrow to get them trained and operational. If there is any problem, it will be checked and fixed,” the minister said.Built for the 2007 Pan-American games, the Engenhao stadium has the capacity for up to 60,000 spectators, including temporary stands. It will host soccer between Wednesday and Sunday, and will be the venue for athletics from Aug. 12 onwards."

Trump lashed out at Khan after he delivered a moving speech at the Democratic National Convention alongside his wife about losing their son during the Iraq War.Khan, who is Muslim, also decried Trump’s repeated calls to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S., noting he has “sacrificed nothing” for the country he is campaigning to lead.When Trump was questioned about the dispute on ABC News, his response focused on how Khan’s wife, Ghazala, remained silent during the DNC speech, as if she “wasn’t allowed to have anything to say.” Trump also claimed that he had made “a lot of sacrifices,” such as creating jobs and building structures with “tremendous success.”Even HBO comedian John Oliver, who hosts the popular weekly show “Last Week Tonight,” appeared to lose his temper while addressing Trump’s insensitive response to the Khan family.“OK, for a start, [Khizr Khan’s] wife has explained that she chose not to speak because she gets too upset when she sees images of her dead son’s face, you fucking asshole,” Oliver barked.“Honestly,” he continued, “we may be on the brink of electing such a damaged, sociopathic narcissist that the simple presidential duty of comforting the families of fallen soldiers may actually be beyond his capabilities, and I genuinely did not think that that was a part of the job that someone could be bad at.”Hollande denounced Trump’s remarks as “hurtful and humiliating” and warned of the global implications a Trump presidency would have. “If the Americans choose Trump, that will have consequences, because an American election is a world election,” he said.The embattled French president is expected to run for re-election in 2017. He has fielded sharp criticism on France’s national security following two horrific terrorism attacks in July. Less than two weeks after a truck driver plowed through a crowd of innocents celebrating Bastille Day in the streets of Nice, two teenagers slit the throat of an elderly French priest at a church in Normandy. Both incidents were claimed by the so-called Islamic State, sparking nationwide fear and panic.Hastily politicizing the tragedy in Nice ― much like he did after the deadly attacks in Paris in January of last year ― Trump cast the blame on his democratic rivals in the U.S., and emphasized the threat that “Islamic terrorism” poses to the world. His ongoing anti-Islamic rhetoric has been widely condemned as fearmongering, both in America and abroad.Soon after the gruesome murder of Father Jacques Hamel in Normandy, Trump asserted that France had lost its identity: “France is no longer France,” he claimed.“France will always be France,” an angry Hollande retaliated. “It never gives up, because it still bears ideals, values, principles that are recognized worldwide, and it’s when you lower your standards that you are no longer what you are. That’s something that may happen to others, on the other side of the Atlantic.”French Prime Minister Manuel Valls also spoke out sharply against Trump’s influence, suggesting “Trumpization” in the form of “sweeping accusations” and “slander” had started to seep into French politics. It is “undermining our constitution, our principles, our values and the rule of law,” he warned.Valls’ comments came in the wake of an influential Trump endorsement by Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right Front National party.“Between [Donald Trump] and Hillary Clinton, it is clear that I would choose Donald Trump,” said Le Pen, who has also garnered attention for her Islamophobic remarks. Le Pen’s niece Marion, the vice-president of the Front National, and father Jean-Marie, the former party leader, have also endorsed Trump.Domestically, Trump’s row with the Khan family triggered a damning reaction from U.S. President Barack Obama, who called the Republican nominee “unfit to serve” as president.“Why are you still endorsing him?” Obama asked Republican politicians. “What does this say about your party that this is your standard-bearer?”Several Republican leaders, including Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Pat Toomey (Pa.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa) have since denounced Trump’s comments. Despite the outrage from foreign leaders and domestic politicians, including many within his own party, Trump has yet to apologize to the Khans.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

About $1 billion of this has not yet been delivered, according to the report published on Wednesday.More funds are also needed to help families cover food and other basic costs, ODI Executive Director Kevin Watkins said.“If you’re a parent faced with a choice of giving your children a square meal at the end of the day, or paying for the transport ... to send them to school ... you’re likely to make a choice in favour of adequate nutrition,” Watkins said in an interview.Poverty levels among Syrian refugees have increased sharply since the start of Syria’s civil war in 2011, as rental charges, rising food costs and spending on healthcare and heating have eaten into the savings of refugee families.More than half of the 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon cannot afford enough food, and some 70 percent live on less than $115 per month, the country’s poverty line, ODI said.Nearly 90,000 Syrian refugees in school in Lebanon may lose their places because of lack of funding, the report said.Lebanon’s minister for education, Elias Bou Saab, urged donors to deliver on their February pledges, and to commit to funding education over several years.“Only then can we make the decisions needed to keep children in school. Regional governments need more planning certainty,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.“For our part, we will do everything we can to get every child into school.

But if I go to school, nobody is going to bring food to my home,” the report quotes a 13-year-old refugee in Turkey as saying.Sarah Brown, president of international children’s charity Theirworld which published the report, said the lack of access to education was widely cited by refugee parents as one of the main reasons for risking the hazardous journey to Europe.“The vast loss of potential caused by the crisis in education threatens to deprive Syria of the skills it will need to rebuild a war-torn society,” said Brown, wife of U.N. envoy for education and former British prime minister Gordon Brown, in a statement.Watkins said young teenagers with no hope of an education grow up at greater risk of being recruited by extremists.“I would say not delivering on this pledge is about the highest mistake it’s possible for the international community to make at this stage,” he said.(Reporting by Alex Whiting, Editing by Katie Nguyen.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

A series of anonymous allegations and counter-allegations had poisoned the culture at the college, he added.The president of the seminary, Hugh Connolly, said no investigation had taken place because there had been no official complaint.“It is very important that anything we do, we do in natural justice, in other words, that we will always act only when we have clarity and when we have grounds to act,” Connolly told RTE. “Broadly speaking, I think the atmosphere is a very good one.”(Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

Following the team’s practice on Saturday, Bennett stood in front of reporters wearing a “Black Lives Matter” shirt and continued to stress the importance of supporting one another. “With everything that’s going on in society right now, you just want to be a good advocate for speaking up when things are going wrong,” Bennett said. “The women and WNBA have really stood up for what they want, and I think that it’s time for the players in the NFL.”You can watch his press conference comments here.Bennett’s comments come in the wake of a public protest by members of the WNBA, including the Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Indiana Fever and Phoenix Mercury, who wore all-black warmup shirts to speak out about the shootings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and the Dallas police officers in the early days of July.In Bennett’s opinion, the superstars of the NFL have not taken on as large a role in speaking out against social injustices as athletes in other major sports have. He even went as far as to name Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton as one of the players who is not doing enough. “The greatest players aren’t involved like LeBron James, Chris Paul and all these guys. Our great players are just sitting back and taking the dollars, whether it’s Cam Newton, all these guys are not really on the forefront of trying to change what’s going on.” Bennett reportedly reached out and apologized to Cam Newton Sunday for the comments he made after Saturday’s practice, explaining that he did not intend to create tension between players. “It takes a village to do something like this. It’s not going to be one player.” Bennett told ESPN. “It’s going to be a group of players. I just want to emphasize that to a lot of the players.”"

That includes a huge bump in fundraising during and immediately after Clinton accepted her party’s presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28. According to the campaign, Clinton raised $8.7 million online from 8 p.m. on July 28 to 8 p.m. on July 29.“We come out of the Democratic National Convention with our party united and our supporters energized for the final 98 days of this campaign,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. “Our goal for the next 98 days is to take the remarkable outpouring of support we saw as Hillary Clinton took the stage in Philadelphia and build on our efforts to organize and mobilize millions of voters to elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot in November.”The majority of money Clinton raised in July went into her campaign coffer. In total, she raised $63 million for her official campaign committee and another $26 million for the Democratic National Committee and various state parties through her two joint fundraising committees. She ended the month with $58 million cash on hand.The $63 million Clinton raised for her campaign in July tops the $49 million President Barack Obama pulled in for his during the same month of the 2012 election cycle, even though Obama is the most prolific fundraiser in American political history. That may be because the 2012 Democratic convention was held in August, rather than July. Conventions not only tend to provide a bump in polling, but also help boost fundraising. Obama’s fundraising haul for his convention month, August 2012, was $110 million, $85 million of it for his campaign.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has not yet released his campaign’s July fundraising numbers. On Monday, however, the billionaire candidate stated that he had raised $36 million from small donors in July. Forbes also reported that Trump had raised $70 million for his campaign and the Republican Party in July, according to fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci. It is not clear how much money went to the campaign or the party."

Pollsters recognize something called social desirability bias, when voters are reluctant to tell an interviewer they hold an unpopular position.The phenomenon has caused real problems for polls in the past. The canonical American example is Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles and an African American. He narrowly lost the 1982 race for California’s governorship to a white candidate, despite leading in the polls. In the U.K., the “shy Tory” factor left surveys, particularly in the 1990s, seriously underestimating how many conservative voters would turn out on Election Day.But pollsters for both parties say there is little evidence to suggest that Trump is facing a similar issue.“It’s possible [that some respondents won’t admit to supporting Trump], but I don’t think so,” said Bill McInturff, a longtime Republican pollster. “For two candidates with unusual negatives, the ballot by sub-group looks pretty traditional for what we’ve been seeing the last few cycles.”“We won’t be able to say for sure until after Election Day, but it’s very unlikely,” said Mark Mellman, a longtime Democratic pollster. “Most of these kinds of theories don’t hold much water. People claimed primary polls were undercounting the Trump vote and they did not.”Indeed, if Trump’s poll numbers were suffering from voter embarrassment, we probably would have seen it already. But Trump did not reliably outperform the polls in actual voting during the Republican primaries. As FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten noted in May, “Trump did worse than the polling forecast in 19 states; he did better in 15 states. ... Overall, Trump’s percentage of the vote versus the polls is about what you’d expect of the average politician.”A pollster for Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump’s rival in the primaries, told Politico last month that Cruz’s campaign faced “no challenge accurately measuring Trump voter support” and saw “zero evidence” of a shy Trump effect.The general election might be different from the primaries. Republican voters reluctantly falling into line with their nominee could be more susceptible to embarrassment.If so, there would be another way of measuring it: Trump would be doing worse in polls conducted by a live interviewer than in polls conducted online or using automated phone calls, where respondents don’t have to disclose their opinions to real people.“The best way to see it would be to compare self-administered with live interviewer,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “The problem is we don’t really have comparable self-administered and live surveys since MOST self-administered are not representative random samples.”Still, data from HuffPost Pollster’s tracking of the presidential race suggest that support for Trump varies little between live-interviewer surveys and those conducted online or using automated calls.Greenberg noted one other way of testing whether Trump is suffering from voter embarrassment. And here too, she said, the phenomenon seems overstated or non-existent.“I also look at how the Trump vote lines up with partisanship,” she said in an email before the conventions. “In many of the places I’m polling, Trump’s vote is lining up with the percent who call themselves Republican.”If anything, Greenberg said at the time, it was Hillary Clinton who was “underperforming relative to partisanship.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Real incomes for the bottom 99 percent of American households have actually fallen since the economy technically climbed out of recession.The recovery has been weak because people who live in the United States do not have enough money to buy the things they need. When consumers fail to spend money, shopkeepers cannot employ the workers needed to sell them goods and producers cannot employ people to make stuff. This means fewer people are working, which in turn means that families have less money to spend on necessities, and the cycle continues.The solution is for somebody to spend money to put people to work for good pay. Since the private sector is failing to do that, the government has good reason to step in. That spending can be paid for by increasing taxes, by cutting other spending, by issuing new debt or some combination of the three. Which brings us to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who are both running for president and talking about the economy. Trump is running a fascist campaign which, in addition to attacking American veterans, women and immigrants, has proposed a massive tax cut. Even under a generous analysis from a conservative think tank, Trump’s tax plan would balloon the total federal debt by about 75 percent, with the overwhelming majority of the benefits flowing to the super rich. None of this would directly address the core economic problem behind the sluggish recovery ― ordinary Americans not having enough money to buy things. In other words, Trump’s tax plan is a complete joke. But even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Appearing on Fox Business on Tuesday, Trump vowed to “at least double” the size of Clinton’s proposal to spend $275 billion rebuilding American infrastructure. This would be, effectively, a massive government spending program aimed at putting people back to work, addressing the actual economic problem of the day. When Fox asked how Trump would pay for his $550 billion-plus program, which would rival the amount of infrastructure spending in President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package, Trump made vague gestures to a “fund.”“People, investors,” Trump told Fox Business. “People would put money into the fund, citizens would put money into the fund and we will rebuild our infrastructure with that fund and it will be a great investment and it’s going to put a lot of people to work.”This is an awkward description of a very common process otherwise known as “borrowing money.” It drew immediate scorn from “how are you going to pay for that?” circles. But here’s the thing: Selling bonds to pay for spending isn’t just a reasonable idea. It’s the obvious smart thing to do.Right now, it is actually profitable for the U.S. government to borrow money ― even if you don’t take into account economic growth, future tax revenues or any of the other effects that increased government spending might have.The global economy is so screwed up that investors are offering the U.S. government negative real interest rates. Taking inflation into account, investors will pay the government to park their money with us. We can quite literally profit from borrowing.In late June, Ezra Klein directly asked Clinton whether she would take advantage of these conditions to boost government spending. She rejected the idea, arguing that the government should tax the rich to pay for new investments. That’s all well and good, but there’s no reason Clinton couldn’t do both. She didn’t explain why her administration would be incapable of both taxing the rich and capitalizing on a debt market that quite literally allows the government to reduce the deficit by borrowing money. Trump’s infrastructure plan, if you can call it that, is vague and poorly defined. But so is Clinton’s. Her initiative involves private capital, public investment and a new institution known as an “infrastructure bank” which may or may not be a truly great idea, depending on the as-yet-unreleased details. And it’s OK to be vague about the details of these proposals months before taking office, when you don’t know exactly what Congress or the global economy will look like. But the idea of borrowing money to pay for a major investment in the U.S. economy is perfectly sound. Only very hard-line conservatives would reject it. And in the process of attacking Trump’s tax plan, the Clinton team has at times relied on conservative arguments. During a speech in late June, Clinton attacked the idea of printing money to pay for new debt. “We know what happens to countries that tried that in the past, like Germany in the ‘20s or Zimbabwe in the ‘90s,” Clinton said. The United States in 2016 is not Germany in the ‘20s or Zimbabwe in the ‘90s. It has a functional economy and a stable, legitimate democratic government with a debt burden nowhere near what the Weimar Republic faced after World War I. Even if investors weren’t offering to pay us money to borrow from us, we would not be risking hyperinflation by financing modest new borrowing with money-printing. That isn’t a radical idea. It’s Keynesian economics, something Democrats typically approve of. Clinton’s attacks (which have been echoed by allies on Twitter and in a Democratic National Convention video) smack of fear-mongering, not measured analysis.To be clear, under the tax plan Trump put forward in September, the federal government would effectively borrow $10 trillion, hand almost all of it to rich people and then see what happens. If things get ugly, Trump has said he would print money to deal with it. That’s a dumb plan. But it’s not dumb because it involves borrowing or printing money. It’s dumb because it would give tons of borrowed money to rich people for no reason. The infrastructure plan Trump floated on Tuesday wouldn’t do that. It involves borrowing money (at a profit) and spending it on projects that put people to work tackling real economic needs. That’s a good idea, if Trump actually understands it.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The fire, which has been burning in Soberanes Creek, Garrapata State Park and the area north of Big Sur since July 22, is now larger than San Francisco, the Weather Channel noted Monday.

Cal Fire said last month it responded to twice as many fires in the first half of 2016 as in that period of 2015.“Your mind sort of rejects something that is so not natural,” Calaveras County resident Kim Dougherty, who lost her home in last fall’s Butte fire, told The Huffington Post at the time. “It’s hard to imagine the enormity of it because you don’t even realize that your favorite tool, a screwdriver you’ve carried with you for the last 40 years, is gone.

And if it does, simply quit your job or switch careers. NBD.On Tuesday, Fox anchor Megyn Kelly joined just about every woman on Earth in disagreeing with this theory, after Eric Trump told CBS that his sister “wouldn’t allow herself to be subjected to [sexual harassment].”Fox’s most powerful female correspondent doesn’t think much of this answer.Ever since she called out Trump for his past comments about women in an early GOP primary debate and suffered through a public back-and-forth with the reality star, Kelly ― who works at a very conservative news network ― has become a rather unlikely feminist hero. Reportedly, it was Kelly’s private admission to investigators that she too had been propositioned by Fox News CEO Roger Ailes early in her tenure that fueled the news network to force the long-serving CEO out. She also reportedly encouraged other Fox employees to come forward.Eric Trump’s comments on Tuesday followed some equally offensive remarks from his father, which were published on Monday in USA Today. When asked what he thought his daughter would do if subjected to sexual harassment, Trump said, “I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case.” He also cast doubt on the numerous allegations against Ailes, saying he’s confused why all these women are “complaining.”In both the Trumps’ remarks, there’s a classic problem of blaming the victim. “The idea that women choose or don’t choose to be sexually harassed is toxic rhetoric that inherently places the blame on women rather than the men who commit the harassment,” writes HuffPost’s Jenavieve Hatch. And by saying Ivanka wouldn’t put up with such behavior, the implication is other women do tolerate harassment.The elder Trump also puts the onus on women to deal with harassment. But of course, the “walk away from your entire career” strategy only (maybe) works for someone like Ivanka ― a woman born into extreme wealth who doesn’t actually need to work for money. Many women don’t have much choice about whom to work for and when to quit. What’s more, some women actually care about their jobs and wouldn’t just give up because of the boorish behavior of some guy.After all, what kind of strategy is it to change your entire career because of some sexist bully? Even if you don’t need a job ― or a specific career ― you do have the right to work in an environment free from sexual propositions and demeaning treatment. Really, that’s a right. There are laws against sexual harassment and discrimination.In Ailes’ case, he was accused of not renewing anchor Gretchen Carlson’s contract after she declined to have sex with him. Should Carlson just have quit and let Ailes’ behavior stand, so it could potentially be repeated on more women? This is pretty absurd stuff -- even coming from a presidential campaign that has actually made the harassment and marginalization of women part of its strategy.Just on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested that Hillary Clinton doesn’t “look presidential” ― a gendered argument if there ever was one. A woman, of course, doesn’t look anything like any U.S. president, since there’s never been a female running America. Perhaps the Trumps are hoping that Clinton will just change careers.Sigh."

The young men arrived at her office the next day at 10:15 a.m.Heard then asked the teens why they wanted to work, assuming that they would say they wanted money. The response Heard got instead surprised her.“That’s when Desmond told me, ‘We just don’t want to be in gangs.’”Heard said the other three teens turned their heads away, but Woodard pressed on. “He said, ‘Tell her the truth, tell her they’ve approached all of us, not just me.’”The boys confirmed that they had been approached by gangs. “I knew then we had to put them to work fast,” Heard said.The boys were hired that day and Heard posted about the experience on Facebook:So far the post has received over 600 shares, over 400 likes and comments from people beaming with support.Heard told HuffPost that the boys are hard workers that don’t turn up their noses at any task — even when tending to the community’s new chickens.“Even cleaning out the chicken coop yesterday, they do it and they don’t complain at all,” Heard said. “Anything we ask they do it.”"

Half of the participants were getting at least 14 percent of their calories from animal protein and at least 4 percent from plant protein.At the start of the study, participants were 49 years old on average. Most were women.By the end of the study, about 36,000 people died – about 8,850 of cardiovascular disease and roughly 13,000 of cancer.After accounting for lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking, obesity and physical inactivity, each 3 percent increase in calories from plant protein was associated with a 10 percent lower risk of death during the study period.In contrast to the benefits seen with plants, each 10 percent increase in the proportion of calories from animal protein was associated with a 2 percent higher risk of death from any cause and an 8 percent increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease during the study period.This association between animal protein and mortality was even stronger for people who were obese or heavy drinkers, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.“Obese individuals, as well as individuals with unhealthy lifestyle choices are more likely to have underlying metabolic or inflammatory disorders which could enhance the adverse effects of high animal protein intake,” Dr. Pagona Lagiou, a nutrition researcher at the University of Athens who wasn’t involved in the study said by email.Animal protein, however, didn’t appear linked to higher mortality for people with a healthy lifestyle. For these people, eating more plant protein also didn’t seem tied to a longer life.Because the study was observational, it can’t prove that the type of protein people eat directly influences how long they may live, the authors note. It’s also possible that the eating and lifestyle habits of healthcare workers might not be representative of the broader population of adults. The real risk of mortality from animal protein also appears largely tied to processed meat, noted Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston.“Other animal source foods seem pretty neutral overall but represent a diverse group, from chicken to eggs to yogurt, for which we need to understand each of their specific health effects, outside any single isolated nutrient such as protein,” Mozaffarian, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.“Based on a wealth of evidence, it’s crucial to eats lots of specific, healthier plant-based foods: fruits, nuts, seeds, beans, non-starchy veggies,” Mozaffarian added. “But don’t focus on ‘plant-based’ per se: a lot of the worst choices in the food supply are plant-based, from French fries to soda to white bread and white rice.”SOURCE: bit.ly/2aGeXoG JAMA Internal Medicine, online August 1, 2016."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-stolen-election_us_57a104c8e4b0e2e15eb7b3f0,The GOP nominee and a key adviser warn that the presidency will be stolen from him.,2016-08-02,Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is warning his supporters that a victory in the November election is likely to be stolen from him.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a106992a00000002fb448e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump appears to have decided that the only way he can lose the November election is if it is stolen from him, thereby putting Republican Party officials in yet another no-win situation.Either they defend their presidential nominee and impugn the integrity of this country’s balloting, or incur the wrath of millions of his supporters who might believe his unsupported assertion of a “rigged” election.So far, the consensus response has been silence.The top two elected Republicans in the country, House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), both of whom have endorsed Trump, declined to comment. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus’ spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, referred questions back to Trump. “I would ask the campaign to clarify what they mean,” she said.Trump’s campaign did not respond to Huffington Post’s requests for clarification. But at a town hall meeting in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday, Trump told his audience: “I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest.”In an appearance on Fox News that aired later, Trump suggested there had been election fraud in 2012, and that it would likely happen again. “I’m telling you, November 8, we’d better be careful because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it’s going to be taken away from us,” he said.And on Fox News again Tuesday, Trump said that with courts striking down voter ID laws as discriminatory, fraud was even more likely. “People are going to walk in there, they’re going to vote 10 times, maybe. Who knows? They’re going to vote 10 times,” Trump said.The campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton denounced Trump’s remarks as irresponsible for a major party nominee. “Even for a reflexive conspiracy theorist like Trump, this is pathetic. It’s dangerous, too,” Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said.One RNC member who spoke on condition of anonymity could offer no defense: “What do you want us to say?”Trump’s claims ― for which he offered zero evidence ― appear to be following the advice of former campaign staffer and longtime adviser Roger Stone.“I think we have widespread voter fraud, but the first thing that Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly,” Stone told the conservative website Breitbart.“He needs to say, for example, today would be a perfect example: ‘I am leading in Florida. The polls all show it. If I lose Florida, we will know that there’s voter fraud. If there’s voter fraud, this election will be illegitimate, the election of the winner will be illegitimate, we will have a constitutional crisis, widespread civil disobedience, and the government will no longer be the government,’” Stone said. “I think he’s got to put them on notice that their inauguration will be a rhetorical [one], and when I mean civil disobedience, not violence, but it will be a bloodbath. The government will be shut down if they attempt to steal this and swear Hillary in. No, we will not stand for it. We will not stand for it.”Stone, like Trump, pointed to the 2012 election and Ohio in particular. He cited GOP strategist Karl Rove’s storied meltdown on the set of Fox News when he refused to believe analyses that Obama had won that state.“The reason he was so certain is because it was bought and paid for. He knew the fix was supposed to be in. Therefore I can only conclude that sometimes things don’t stay bought, and perhaps Obama came in with a better offer,” Stone said.That theory, that Democrats had committed widespread election fraud to win Ohio, was a favorite among internet conspiracy theorists after Obama’s re-election. To counter that, the state’s Republican secretary of state, Jon Husted, conducted an exhaustive investigation that found, out of 5.6 million votes cast, a total of 135 involved possible fraud. Most were instances of a person trying to vote twice, while two dozen involved people registered to vote in Ohio and another state.Husted told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that while Democrats are wrong to say that Republicans have made it too difficult to vote, “Donald Trump is wrong when he says the system is rigged. Ohio is a place where it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.”The “rigged election” claim is only the latest Trump statement from which other Republicans have sought to distance themselves. His feud with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army officer killed in Iraq, his attacks on an Indiana-born judge of Mexican heritage presiding over a fraud trial against him, and his comments about women have all caused other Republicans to denounce their presidential nominee’s views.This article has been updated to include additional remarks Trump made on Fox News.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
29,BUSINESS,The One Billionaire With The Credibility To Debunk Trump,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warren-buffett-stop-donald-trump_us_57a0d1d8e4b0693164c2d56c,Warren Buffett might be the only super-rich person Americans actually listen to.,2016-08-02,Hillary Clinton and Warren Buffett at an event in 2007. The billionaire called out Donald Trump at a Clinton rally Monday. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a0d2091300002a007c2773.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Could Warren Buffett be the one billionaire that can actually help defeat Donald Trump?Buffett, who is the third-richest person in the world, called out the GOP presidential nominee Monday at a rally for Hillary Clinton. The self-made billionaire, who runs conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to release his tax returns, and blasted the reality TV star for the offensive comments he’s made about Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan. (“The final straw,” Buffett said.) And, of course, Buffett criticized Trump’s business background:“In 1995, when he offered this company, if a monkey had thrown a dart at the stock page, the monkey on average would have made 150 percent,” Buffett said. “But the people that believed in him, that listened to his siren song, came away losing well over 90 cents on the dollar. ... I’ve really never known another businessman that brags about his bankruptcies. To tell you the truth, why not? I mean, it’s his claim to stardom. I don’t know anybody else that’s had six bankruptcies, but there he is.” Buffett, who’s supported Clinton for months, is not the first billionaire or prominent businessperson to denounce Trump. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg forcefully made the anti-Trump case at the DNC last week. George Soros, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and Dallas Mavericks owner and reality TV star Mark Cuban are all pro-Clinton. But Buffett, with his reputation as a modest, folksy billionaire ― it’s a thing, I know ― might be the one super-rich person that Americans actually listen to. He’s been critical of Trump for years.In an election cycle where voters ― particularly those supporting Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ― have expressed anger over rising inequality and the role of money in politics, it’s unclear what kind of sway the super-rich’s words have over the electorate.When HuffPost reported in June that 56 top businesspeople had endorsed Clinton, commenters weren’t impressed. Many thought this was just confirmation that Clinton was on the side of Wall Street and “in the pocket” of corporate interests. An introvert with a down-home populist reputation as a Coke-drinking, ice cream-eating guy who chooses to reside in his home state of Nebraska rather than the super-elite bastions of, say, New York City or London, Buffett isn’t your typical rich guy. He still lives in the five-bedroom house he bought a half-century ago for $31,500. He’s reportedly never attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland ― possibly the ultimate ultra-elite schmooze fest. On Monday, he pledged to drive up to 10 voters to the polls on Election Day. He is, in other words, the anti-Trump. (Though he’s not free from controversy. Buffett’s business in mobile homes has been criticized for preying on the poor.)In 2011, Buffett wrote an editorial for The New York Times titled “Stop Coddling The Super-Rich,” where he said that his secretary and every person in his office was taxed at a higher rate than him. “My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress,” he wrote. “It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.”Buffett argued that the federal government should raise taxes on those making more than $1 million, inspiring the Obama administration to propose its so-called Buffett rule. The new tax did not pass the Republican Congress.Trump has proposed cutting taxes on rich people. This position hasn’t done him any favors with the wealthy. Even the infamously pro-business, pro-Republican Koch brothers have declined to support him.On Tuesday morning, Trump declined to respond to Buffett. “Look, Warren Buffett has been a fan of — he’s a Democrat,” Trump told Fox Business Network. “He’s been a Hillary fan for a long time, and I think that’s fine. Hillary’s a disaster.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
30,POLITICS,Mike Pence Privately Sought Stimulus Funds That He Publicly Criticized,Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-stimulus_us_57a0ca3ae4b0e2e15eb75d0f,"In a letter, the current vice presidential nominee acknowledged that government spending would yield economic benefits.",2016-08-02,A portion of the letter written by then-Rep Mike Pence (R-Ind.) to then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a0ce2e2a00000002fb431a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In February 2009, then-Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) derided President Barack Obama’s stimulus legislation as nothing more than a debt creator. “This bill is not about stimulating the economy,” he said, previewing his vote against the legislation. “It is about stimulating more government.” Six months later Pence privately wrote the administration and requested more than $6 million in stimulus funds for his district.Pence’s lobbying was done on behalf of the city of Muncie, which he represented in Congress. In a letter to then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, he requested approval for a $6.295 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant to supplement funding for the city’s Downtown Economic Enhancement Project. In contrast to his public assessment of the stimulus bill, he predicted in the letter that this money would “help preserve and create jobs while promoting economic recovery.” The funds Pence requested were part of a $1.5 billion grant program that had been authorized by the president’s stimulus bill. “I believe both projects are worthy for TIGER Grant investment and will provide real and long-term economic and livability benefits for the City of Muncie and the surrounding area,” Pence wrote. The letter, obtained by The Huffington Post through a Freedom of Information Act request, complicates the image Pence has projected as a fiscal hawk with sharp, unbending conservative principles. A Pence spokesman, however, sought to cast the letter as an act of responsible legislating more than an abandonment of principle. “Governor Pence opposed stimulus as a member of Congress,” said Marc Lotter, his press secretary. “However, once it became law, he had a responsibility to support local efforts to secure funding for projects that could benefit people in his district. Since the Obama/Clinton administration was forcing current and future taxpayers to pay for the $787 million in stimulus, Hoosiers had a right to see worthy projects funded through it.”Pence is far from the only Republican member of Congress to publicly rail against the stimulus bill while privately petitioning for its goodies. Throughout 2009 and 2010, GOP members routinely showed up at ribbon-cutting ceremonies to celebrate the opening of shops and factories that had benefited from stimulus money. During the 2012 presidential campaign of Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), it was revealed that she had repeatedly sought stimulus funding from various agencies despite having harshly criticized the idea on the stump. In late 2012, then-vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was criticized in a debate for having sent two separate requests for stimulus funding. In actuality, he had sent four. Like Bachmann and Ryan, Pence was outspoken in his opposition to the stimulus bill. He predicted that the bill would “not grow the economy,” argued in favor of a package half the size composed entirely of targeted tax cuts, and later called for a “freeze” of federal spending. For stances like this, he earned plaudits from conservative groups, such as the Club for Growth, which said it had for years celebrated Pence’s “principled stands for economic conservatism.” It is also, in part, why he was tapped as a vice presidential nominee by Donald Trump, whose aides saw Pence as a balance to the mercurial and unpredictable candidate at the top of the ticket and as a way to appease the conservatives in the Republican Party.Pence has occasionally muddied that reputation, most notably with his decision to expand Medicaid as governor of Indiana. But while the stimulus request adds another complication, it’s worth noting that he ultimately proved unsuccessful. According to the anti-spending group Center for Effective Government, which tracks stimulus spending, Muncie received roughly $2.5 million in Recovery Act funding, none of which was awarded by the Department of Transportation. The funds Pence sought would have gone to a bike and pedestrian “Cultural Trail” as well as to a “Quiet Zone” in which certain railroad crossings would have been eliminated and others would have had their safety features enhanced. Muncie leaders were hoping downtown development would be improved if trains passing through did not necessarily have to blow their horns.“The city had been looking at it for a dozen or so years,” said Dick Weigel, senior project manager with HWC Engineering. “They felt like in order to revitalize downtown that was a key piece of that effort.” The project has proceeded without the stimulus money.

For those who slept through middle school history class, in the late 16th century, over 100 colonists disappeared from a North Carolina settlement overnight, only to leave behind a cryptic message carved into a fence that surrounded the village.The reason behind their disappearance has never been substantiated. Some have theorized that the group fled to Croatoan Island off the coast of the colony, while others have speculated that a supernatural event was responsible. (If the rumors are true, we’re guessing Ryan Murphy and co. are going with the latter). The other photos from the set that feature a colonial-era farmhouse, as well as the teasers for the new season released last month, seem to support this theory. According to FX CEO John Landgraf, the newest installment, much like the previous seasons, will utilize flashbacks to different time periods as a storytelling device.“It’s set in the present although with echoes of the past,” he told Variety. “It’s set in two time periods … but principally in the present.”Watch the six teasers below: "
