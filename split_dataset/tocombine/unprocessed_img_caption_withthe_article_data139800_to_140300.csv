According to a Radar Online exclusive, Anna Wintour is hosting a private dinner with Dunham in attempt to ""seduce Lena into bringing her next generation audience into the Vogue brand.""Lena and her show ""Girls"" have been featured in Vogue before (see here and here), but never on the glossy's coveted cover. And the more we think about the prospect, the more we genuinely hope it's happening. Below, seven reasons a prospective Lena feature makes total sense:1. We're patiently waiting for ""Girls"" to come back on the air already, and a lengthy story will whet our appetite for drama during the hiatus.2. Lena has covered fashion mags before... and can seriously smize.3. We know Lena is interested in fashion...""I do love clothes. People are always surprised to hear that -- they think I walk around in a washcloth or something."" -- as told to Marie Claire UK4. ... so she could get a great boost from Vogue editors' expertise.5. Lena loves Delia's -- could she be the one to convince Vogue to showcase more low-key, low-budget brands?6. Featuring a regular, non-model figure like Lena's would do wonders for our body image. (Take that, New York Times!)7. Both Lena and Anna are political and use their stature to champion causes dear to them.C'mon, Anna -- we have a feeling a Lena Dunham issue would be a total blockbuster.

Watching young children sharing the love of our music with their parents and grandparents is the ultimate reward for our efforts. Very humbling.MP: If you could say something to everyone on the planet, what would it be? ML: Keep a cool head and a warm heart. A mantra that became a song, inspired by the wise words of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. If we all take the time to listen and love each other, this world would be a better place.MP: How do you keep your center in the middle of chaos? ML: Since learning Transcendental Meditation from Maharishi in December 1967, it has been a valuable practice which has enabled me to go through some very stressful life experiences while remaining centered.MP: What makes you vulnerable?ML: Because of the inherent challenges of life on the earth, all of humanity is vulnerable. This is all the more reason to seek the kingdom of heaven within and find the peace that leads to understanding.MP: What's your biggest passion or project right now? ML: For years, I have been writing and recording music that has never been released. Lately, I have been motivated to share with everyone. As a songwriter, your songs are, in a way, like your children -- you want them to be appreciated.MP: What causes are you most involved with? Why?ML: Beginning this summer, I have decided to spotlight the efforts of City Year, an organization that mentors kids who are at risk of dropping out of school and never reaching their full potential. I’m making a year-long commitment to City Year. The service that city year volunteers provide is of enormous value to our society. I applaud all organizations involved in the service of education. I’ve always been very involved with environmental issues. I was fortunate to be one of the speakers at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero some years back, and Bruce Johnson and I served on the board of the Surfrider Foundation here at home. Locally and globally, we need to be doing everything we can to help Mother Earth.MP: What's one of the biggest lessons you've learned from being a part of a legendary band?ML: I learned that when you do the best job that you can do, some people will idolize you, others won't care and some will vilify you. I believe it is important to remain humble and thankful for the blessings in our lives, for the tremendous opportunities that are a result of our musical success.MP: What's been your greatest struggle?ML: To coexist while watching the people I love choose less than life-supporting paths via drugs, alcohol or poor lifestyle decisions. There is so much to life; my heart breaks watching someone held captive by addiction.MP: What would you like your personal legacy to be?ML: On a personal level, I would like my loved ones to know that I have always done the best that I could to demonstrate my love, and worked hard to provide them with a sense of security. On a more global level, I would like to see that my efforts, whether with the Beach Boys or as an individual, achieve as much benefit to humanity as possible during my lifetime. Peace and love!
