2,POLITICS,Obama Wants More Girls And Kids Of Color To Learn Computer Science,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/computer-science-for-all_us_56abe38be4b00b033aaf3689,The White House has a new plan to get students involved in the important subject.,2016-01-30,A new initiative announced Saturday by the White House will allocate billions of dollars in funding for school districts to expand access to computer science education.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States has a problem with access to computer science programs in schools. In nine states, not a single African-American student took an AP computer science exam last year. Significantly fewer girls took the exam than boys.A new initiative announced Saturday by the White House seeks to rectify some of these inequalities. The plan comes after President Barack Obama announced his commitment to expanding computer science offerings during this year's State of the Union address, in which he said he wants to every student to have hands-on computer science and math classes. The push, titled the Computer Science for All initiative, includes $4 billion in Obama's upcoming budget and $100 million to be distributed directly to districts.""In the new economy, computer science isn’t an optional skill -- it’s a basic skill, right along with the three 'Rs.' Nine out of 10 parents want it taught at their children’s schools,"" Obama said during his weekly address Saturday morning. ""Yet right now, only about a quarter of our K-12 schools offer computer science. Twenty-two states don’t even allow it to count toward a diploma."" The plan will ""help make sure all our kids get an opportunity to learn computer science, especially girls and minorities,"" he said.If passed, the $4 billion Obama allocates for the effort in his upcoming budget would be distributed to states over the next three years. To receive the funds, states will have to submit plans describing how they intend to expand computer science access in schools. The $100 million for districts will be distributed in the form of a competitive grant. Districts will have to apply for the grant by describing nationally replicable plans to expand computer science offerings for students.The $4 billion and $100 million in funding ""will allow more states and districts to offer hands-on CS [computer science] courses across all of their public high schools, get students involved early by creating high-quality CS learning opportunities in elementary and middle schools, expand overall access to rigorous science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) coursework, and ensure all students have the chance to participate, including girls and underrepresented minorities,"" according to a press release from the White House.Other organizations and federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation and the Corporation for National and Community Service, are committing funds to the initiative specifically intended for training and supporting computer science teachers. Obama has also called on companies, politicians and philanthropists to get involved in the initiative through increased investments.On a call with reporters, Microsoft President Brad Smith called the initiative an ""economic and social imperative.""Acting Secretary of Education John King said the initiative builds on progress already happening at the state and local level.""If all do our part we can create a movement that not only gets our students ready for the future, but gives them a voice in shaping that future,"" he said."

But the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting reported on Friday that officers took her down using an ""Aikido restraint"" move, didn't check in on her overnight and waited 11 minutes to give her CPR when they found her unresponsive.Guards at the center are supposed to check in on juvenile inmates every 15 minutes, but McMillen may have gone unchecked for hours, according to the New York Daily News. One guard is on paid administrative leave for missing the checks, pending an internal investigation.A state Department of Juvenile Justice spokesman told the Daily News that McMillen refused to take her hooded sweatshirt off when she was booked on a misdemeanor charge of domestic assault on Jan. 10. Several guards then used what the state is calling an ""Aikido restraint"" move, which could be any number of moves from the Japanese martial art. It's unclear exactly how McMillen was restrained.Guards tried to wake her with verbal commands at 6:30 a.m., 8:17 a.m. and 8:53 a.m., according to reports. When they tried to physically wake her at 10 a.m., she was ""cold"" and unresponsive in a sleeping position.The responding guard then waited nine minutes to call 911, and another two after talking with dispatchers, according to a CBS report.""The staff performed an Aikido restraint hold to safely conduct a pat-down search and remove the youth's hoodie,"" a state official wrote in an incident report. ""The purpose of having multiple staff involved in a controlled restraint is to ensure the safety of the youth and staff.""The teen's ""repeated refusal to cooperate with staff and remove her outer garment prompted the restraint,"" the official wrote.McMillen's attorney, Ron Hillerich, told WLKY that the teen ""was a healthy young lady."" Preliminary autopsy reports found no signs of overdose or trauma."

But Trump has taken the strategy of playing to Americans' worst fears and anxieties to a new level, proposing deporting all undocumented immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the United States.Trump's strategy does seem to have succeeded so far. Stations have granted him unprecedented attention and he leads the Republican field of presidential candidates.Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. Also on HuffPost:"

He produced the political web series “Chasing the Hill,” starring “The West Wing” alum Richard Schiff and featuring cameos from real-life politicians like Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. He next ran for Congress against 17 other candidates vying to replace retiring California representative Henry Waxman. A profile of the wild 2014 race in The New York Times Magazine, “The Real Candidates of Beverly Hills,” led with a scene aboard Roske's 45-foot yacht.Now the longtime coastal dweller speaks with a convert's zeal about Des Moines, which he touts as the next big magnet for creative types alongside the likes of Austin and Portland. He said a recent Politico Magazine story on how ""America's dullest city got cool"" was dead right. And he raves about his neighbors' generosity, local politicians' accessibility and Des Moines' affordability compared to places like Brooklyn. ""It has a strong artist community,"" Roske said of his adopted city of just over 200,000. ""We just need, physically, more human beings right now."" Roske has had a burst of creativity since moving a year-and-a-half ago into a late 19th century house within spitting distance of the state capital.He staged a play about Abraham Lincoln in the capital, where audience members watched from legislators' desks, and now hosts the weekly TV show “Roske on Politics” on a local ABC affiliate. He's interviewed all the major 2016 candidates -- if you count the 17 seconds or so he got with Hillary Clinton -- and Sunday's half-hour episode will be devoted to an interview with Sen. Bernie Sanders. (I-Vt.)Roske also wrote and directed a scripted drama about the caucus process, “Courting Des Moines,” which premieres Sunday night at the Varsity Theatre. The film picks up where “Chasing the Hill” left off. Congresswoman Samantha Clemons -- played by Melissa Fitzgerald, also of “The West Wing” -- is now running for president and heads to Iowa, where the real-life Democratic and Republican caucuses will be held Monday.“It’s a very entertaining, light portrayal of the Iowa caucus process,"" Roske said. ""It’s as positive as 'House of Cards' is negative.”Former sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), who appeared on Roske’s show when a spare bedroom served as a makeshift studio, is co-hosting the premiere event. Like ""Chasing the Hill,"" the film uses the real-life political media circus as a backdrop for a fictional portrayal of political figures. ""Courting Des Moines"" features actors playing politicians and politicians, like former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, acting (he plays the president). Media figures, like ABC News political director Rick Klein, also make cameos. Roske also wrote fictionalized versions of some real-life local pols, many of whom get to see for the first time Sunday night how they've been depicted on screen. Some locals, accustomed to journalists and filmmakers pouring into the state every four years and doing live shots in front of hay bales, can be wary of an out-of-towner serving up well-worn cliches about life in the Hawkeye state. But Roske said he's reassured Iowans that isn't his intention. ""This a love letter to the Iowa caucus process,"" Roske said. ""I’m a huge believer in the caucus process. I think it’s the last true bastion of American democracy -- here and New Hampshire. So I want this movie to help in whatever part it can to solidify this place.""There's long been criticism of a primary process in which Iowa and New Hampshire, states with small populations and little diversity, have a disproportionate effect on the presidential race. Roske, however, sees Iowans taking their role seriously in assessing the candidates and believes the sort of retail politics that's traditionally worked in the state marks a crucial test for every White House hopeful. “Iowa’s job is not to pick the winner,"" he said. ""It’s to winnow the field, to find out who can talk one-on-one. And if you can’t sit down with them at their kitchen table and care about them, that their sister-in-law just went in the hospital, you’re not fit for the job of president.""Roske's gotten to know the men and women who want to be president this election cycle through ""Roske on Politics,"" which airs after ABC's ""This Week"" in Des Moines and is now broadcast in a second, crucial market for political junkies. ""Roske on Politics"" also airs after ""Meet the Press""on NBC's affiliate in northern Maryland and Washington D.C He owns the TV show and has a hand in all aspects of the low-budget production -- from shooting himself on location to editing and writing captions. Though presidential candidates, and the traveling media horde, will move on from Iowa after Monday night, Roske said he's not worried about keeping the show going. He plans to travel to South Carolina ahead of that state's primary and will do a month-long stint in Washington D.C. Still, the show is not just about campaigns, he said, but more broadly serves as nonpartisan venue for conversations about issues not necessarily tethered to a national race. ""I don’t even say bipartisan,"" Roske said. ""It’s a show about politics. To me, that’s not a partisan discussion.""One of Roske's favorite episodes featured an interview with a Muslim woman who emigrated from Bosnia, pegged to Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Another favorite examined homeless youth, he said.Roske, who was raised in Minnesota and still has family there, said he intended on renting out the Des Moines house after finishing the movie and heading back to California. But in the process, Roske said he ""literally fell in love with Des Moines.""“Making ‘Roske on Politics’ is the most creative and mentally fulfilling thing I’ve ever done,"" he said.

I think it’s the last true bastion of American democracy -- here and New Hampshire. So I want this movie to help in whatever part it can to solidify this place.""There's long been criticism of a primary process in which Iowa and New Hampshire, states with small populations and little diversity, have a disproportionate effect on the presidential race. Roske, however, sees Iowans taking their role seriously in assessing the candidates and believes the sort of retail politics that's traditionally worked in the state marks a crucial test for every White House hopeful. “Iowa’s job is not to pick the winner,"" he said. ""It’s to winnow the field, to find out who can talk one-on-one. And if you can’t sit down with them at their kitchen table and care about them, that their sister-in-law just went in the hospital, you’re not fit for the job of president.""Roske's gotten to know the men and women who want to be president this election cycle through ""Roske on Politics,"" which airs after ABC's ""This Week"" in Des Moines and is now broadcast in a second, crucial market for political junkies. ""Roske on Politics"" also airs after ""Meet the Press""on NBC's affiliate in northern Maryland and Washington D.C He owns the TV show and has a hand in all aspects of the low-budget production -- from shooting himself on location to editing and writing captions. Though presidential candidates, and the traveling media horde, will move on from Iowa after Monday night, Roske said he's not worried about keeping the show going. He plans to travel to South Carolina ahead of that state's primary and will do a month-long stint in Washington D.C. Still, the show is not just about campaigns, he said, but more broadly serves as nonpartisan venue for conversations about issues not necessarily tethered to a national race. ""I don’t even say bipartisan,"" Roske said. ""It’s a show about politics. To me, that’s not a partisan discussion.""One of Roske's favorite episodes featured an interview with a Muslim woman who emigrated from Bosnia, pegged to Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Another favorite examined homeless youth, he said.Roske, who was raised in Minnesota and still has family there, said he intended on renting out the Des Moines house after finishing the movie and heading back to California. But in the process, Roske said he ""literally fell in love with Des Moines.""“Making ‘Roske on Politics’ is the most creative and mentally fulfilling thing I’ve ever done,"" he said. ""I want to keep doing it until I drop dead.”Also on HuffPost:"

King will of course always be remembered as the strong wife and mother who supported her activist husband up until his murder in 1968. But while so much of her legacy is intertwined with that of her late husband's, what's often forgotten is the fact that Mrs. King was an activist in her own right, well before she married her famous husband. Here are the 7 things you may not know about Coretta Scott King's activism: She was active in the Civil Rights Movement as a young college student. King became a member of the NAACP after she was banned from student teaching while pursuing a graduate degree at Antioch College. When one of her supervisors told her that black teachers should not teach white students, she protested, and joined the NAACP on her campus as well as the the Young Progressives and the Civil Liberties Committee. She was an advocate for human rights. In 1983, Mrs. King helped create the Coalition of Conscience. The organization is a collective of 800 human rights groups dedicated to promoting world peace. It sponsored the 20th and 25th anniversaries of the March on Washington. She was against apartheid. She was part of several protests against apartheid in South Africa, and lobbied for the release of Nelson Mandela. She traveled several times to the country to meet with anti-apartheid activists and to support black South Africans affected by state-sanctioned oppression. She was a staunch advocate of gun reform. King was against gun violence, and worked closely with gun control activists Sarah and Jim Brady to speak out on the need to reform the way people access and use guns in the United States. She supported feminist causes. She played a vital role in the founding of the National Organization for Women, and was appointed by President Carter as a commissioner on the National Commission on the Observation of International Women’s Year. She was an LGBT ally. King described homophobia as ""a form of bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood."" Despite her ties to the Baptist church, she worked to raise awareness specifically in the black community about the lives of gay and trans people. At the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic she called for more funding and research and in 1983 she lobbied for an amendment of the Civil Rights Act to include members of the LGBT community in the Protected class, which includes women and people of color.She kept her husband's legacy alive through her own activism. After her husband's death, King founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, Georgia, and served as its president for more than a decade.

16,POLITICS,Trump Taps 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' To Close The Deal In Iowa,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-iowa_us_56ac36fce4b0010e80ea3e55,His Iowa fans like that Trump is an ego-driven loudmouth billionaire. They think he’ll get things done.,2016-01-30,Trump Announces Candidacy for 2016 Presidential Election,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56703dc71900002300789e6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The Donald Trump Show rolled onto the campus of Drake University at the exact moment a bunch of “politicians” were debating each other on television Thursday night.Since Trump doesn’t consider himself a politician -- even though he’s running for president -- he blew off the Republican debate and staged a celebration of his ability to raise money for charity.To the strains of the Rolling Stones, he strode onto the stage. He wore a gleaming white grin and his famously aerodynamic orange hair, and pointed and waved like the TV star he is.Trump was born in Queens, New York, not in a crossfire hurricane, and his daddy gave him a million bucks to start in business. But none of that mattered to the crowd inside and out. Nor does it seem to matter to Iowa Republicans, judging from HuffPost Pollster's aggregation of 92 polls that shows Trump with a widening lead heading into the final weekend before the caucuses. To the audience in the small theater and the hundreds of yards worth of folks lined up on the sidewalks outside, Trump was Jumpin’ Jack Flash -- a gas, gas, gas.There were screams and even a squeal or two when he appeared.Many, if not most, of the people who show up at Trump rallies are not closely aligned with the world of politics and its operation. They tend not to be union members, activists for seniors, or members of the church political outreach club.They are average and politically unconnected people who feel that the government and big companies and foreign countries have screwed or forgotten them.And they think the country -- which is all they’ve got by way of grandeur -- is falling apart and away from them in ways they cannot explain, but feel in their hearts and paychecks.It’s a crowd in which the men, and some of the women, are far more likely to be wearing a football jersey than a Polo sweater.They tend to be middle age, some with kids in tow. It's not the Hillary sedate senior crowd or the burning Bernie young people. Not so many are alumni of Iowa or Iowa State, but some are grads of high school and community college.“Trump is the one who can bring the country back to what it used to be,” said Steve Fligg, a salesman from Des Moines, who was standing in a long line on the Drake campus.“We used to be number one, but now we are losing that to China,” he said.“Trump has the knowledge and the background to really run our country and bring it back because he’s got a lot of business experience.”Jason Hall, a 41-year-old union man who is not a Trump fan, has a lot of friends who are.“Trump is ‘tavern talk’ and they loved it,” Hall said. “They are people who get a lot of their information from TV ads and don’t know much about any of the issues. But they hear Trump and they like that he sounds like he is on a barstool.”Inside the auditorium, the crowd cheered as Trump ticked off the names of rich friends he had commanded to give money to the cause of the night: military veterans.He claimed to have raised $5 million in 24 hours of phone calls. It was like one of those TV “telethons” of old, except that it was The Donald doing all the dialing on his own.Where all the money will go and how exactly it will be spent by the Trump Foundation -- which Trump uses to advertise his good works -- was left unspoken. But to the crowd in the theater, it was as though he had performed some kind of miracle -- with the implication that he could do the same for everyone in the room and everyone in the country.He could be Midas for All, and he would scare away the Chinese and the undocumented immigrants and ISIS radical Islamists and inefficient Washington bureaucrats and … make America Great Again.Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

The good news is any of us can get grittier with a little extra focus and effort.,2016-01-30,2016-01-21-1453412683-198975-11SignsYouHavetheGritYouNeedtoSucceedHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-21-1453412683-198975-11SignsYouHavetheGritYouNeedtoSucceedHP-thumb.jpg,"There are a ton of qualities that can help you succeed, and the more carefully a quality has been studied, the more you know it's worth your time and energy.Angela Lee Duckworth was teaching seventh grade when she noticed that the material wasn't too advanced for any of her students. They all had the ability to grasp the material if they put in the time and effort. Her highest performing students weren't those who had the most natural talent; they were the students who had that extra something that motivated them to work harder than everyone else.Angela grew fascinated by this ""extra something"" in her students and, since she had a fair amount of it herself, she quit her teaching job so that she could study the concept while obtaining a graduate degree in psychology at UPenn.Her study, which is ongoing, has already yielded some interesting findings. She's analyzed a bevy of people to whom success is important: students, military personnel, salespeople, and spelling bee contestants, to name a few. Over time, she has come to the conclusion that the majority of successful people all share one critical thing--grit.Grit is that ""extra something"" that separates the most successful people from the rest. It's the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality.Developing grit is all about habitually doing the things that no one else is willing to do. There are quite a few signs that you have grit, and if you aren't doing the following on a regular basis, you should be.You have to make mistakes, look like an idiot, and try again, without even flinching. In a recent study at the College of William and Mary, they interviewed over 800 entrepreneurs and found that the most successful among them tend to have two critical things in common: They're terrible at imagining failure and they tend not to care what other people think of them. In other words, the most successful entrepreneurs put no time or energy into stressing about their failures as they see failure as a small and necessary step in the process of reaching their goals.You have to fight when you already feel defeated. A reporter once asked Muhammad Ali how many sit-ups he does every day. He responded, ""I don't count my sit-ups, I only start counting when it starts hurting, when I feel pain, cause that's when it really matters."" The same applies to success in the workplace. You always have two choices when things begin to get tough: you can either overcome an obstacle and grow in the process or let it beat you. Humans are creatures of habit. If you quit when things get tough, it gets that much easier to quit the next time. On the other hand, if you force yourself to push through it, the grit begins to grow in you.You have to make the calls you're afraid to make. Sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do because we know they're for the best in the long-run: fire someone, cold call a stranger, pull an all-nighter to get the company server back up, or scrap a project and start over. It's easy to let the looming challenge paralyze you, but the most successful people know that in these moments, the best thing they can do is to get started right away. Every moment spent dreading the task subtracts time and energy from actually getting it done. People that learn to habitually make the tough calls stand out like flamingos in a flock of seagulls.You have to keep your emotions in check. Negative emotions will challenge your grit every step of the way. While it's impossible not to feel your emotions, it's completely under your power to manage them effectively and to keep yourself in a position of control. When you let your emotions overtake your ability to think clearly, it's easy to lose your resolve. A bad mood can make you lash out or stray from your chosen direction just as easily as a good mood can make you overconfident and impulsive.You have to trust your gut. There's a fine line between trusting your gut and being impulsive. Trusting your gut is a matter of looking at decisions from every possible angle, and when the facts don't present a clear alternative, you believe in your ability to choose; you go with what looks and feels right.You have to give more than you get in return. There's a famous Stanford experiment where an administrator leaves a child in a room with a marshmallow for 15 minutes, telling the child that she's welcome to eat the marshmallow, but if she can wait until the experimenter gets back without eating it, she will get a second marshmallow. The children that were able to wait until the experimenter returned experienced better outcomes in life, including higher SAT scores, greater career success, and even lower body mass indexes. The point being that delay of gratification and patience are essential to success. People with grit know that real results only materialize when you put in the time and forego instant gratification.You have to lead when no one else follows. It's easy to set a direction and believe in yourself when you have support, but the true test of grit is how well you maintain your resolve when nobody else believes in what you're doing. People with grit believe in themselves no matter what and they stay the course until they win people over to their way of thinking.You have to meet deadlines that are unreasonable and deliver results that exceed expectations. Successful people find a way to say yes and still honor their existing commitments. They know the best way to stand out from everyone else is to outwork them. For this reason, they have a tendency to over deliver, even when they over promise.You have to focus on the details even when it makes your mind numb. Nothing tests your grit like mind-numbing details, especially when you're tired. The more people with grit are challenged, the more they dig in and welcome that challenge, and numbers and details are no exception to this.You have to be kind to people who have been rude to you. When people treat you poorly, it's tempting to stoop to their level and return the favor. People with grit don't allow others to walk all over them, but that doesn't mean they're rude to them, either. Instead, they treat rude and cruel people with the same kindness they extend to anyone else, because they won't allow another person's negativity to bring them down.  You have to be accountable for your actions, no matter what. People are far more likely to remember how you dealt with a problem than they are how you created it in the first place. By holding yourself accountable, even when making excuses is an option, you show that you care about results more than your image or ego.Bringing It All TogetherGrit is as rare as it is important. The good news is any of us can get grittier with a little extra focus and effort.Is grit really that important? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

But, of course, a camera can capture it all. Easily. This week the people at EyeEm Photo Blog challenged photographers professional and amateur to have a go at macro photography, the art of capturing the world's most diminutive visual treasures. The resulting images depict the pillowy texture of flower petals, the opalesque glow of water droplets, the furry exterior of a string of thread. The following image proves the immense richness of the world around us, if we take the time to look closer. Also on HuffPost:"

Adam McKay, a multi-platform Hollywood hyphenate who helped create some of the most memorable comedies to hit the theaters, is back at the box office with his rendering of Michael Lewis' The Big Short. And he's a man on a mission: ""I just feel like if another crisis comes, we're going to get hit again and we're going to be on the hook,"" he says. In an interview with The Huffington Post, McKay says he was drawn to this movie -- which documents the traders who bet big against America's ""too big to fail"" banks before they collapsed -- because he was ""struck by the fact that the conversation had already stopped"" after the financial crisis. So he's taken Lewis' story and added a blend of interweaving cinematic techniques, creating a film he hopes will be both enjoyable to watch and offer a call to rectify a system that still shows signs of breaking.""I think the biggest crime was that no one was prosecuted,"" says McKay of those who played a part in the housing collapse. ""I think for the most part there was one guy that got put in jail, and I think that's shameful. ... The banks are clearly still too big to fail.""Listen to HuffPost's interview with McKay in the podcast embedded above. The McKay segment begins at the 14:38 mark.But it's very clear that what McKay hopes to achieve by bringing The Big Short to a wider audience is more than merely filing an angry brief against Wall Street. The story's characters -- an odd collection of eccentrics who spotted the rot in the housing market and how deeply embedded the big Wall Street firms were in it -- profited immensely from the tragedy that befell the economy. McKay says there's an important lesson in that: It sort of questions, like -- can there be a hero in a system this far gone? And what is a hero? I'm really proud of the fact that, in the end, you have these guys making loads of money -- but we in no way feel good about it. And I feel like that's something that's been lost in our society. Now, it's sort of like, if you make money, you're good, even if you make money through crappy means. ... That's not cool! I love the fact that these characters in the end are having a crisis.In addition to Adam McKay, this week's ""So, That Happened"" features award-winning author and Atlantic reporter/essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who joins us to offer his perspective on reparations, Reconstruction and the Democratic primary. We're also joined by Florida law professor Tim Canova, who's emerged as Debbie Wasserman Schultz's first primary opponent in a long time. He'll make his case for why he's ready to take up the challenges his opponent has abandoned.""So, That Happened"" is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week is Adam McKay, director of ""The Big Short""; Ta-Nehisi Coates, author of Between the World and Me; and Tim Canova, Democratic candidate for Florida's 23rd District House seat. Also joining are Huffington Post reporters Paige Lavender and Lauren Webber."

Muva spoke with Theo Von and Matthew Coles Weiss for their ""Allegedly"" podcast Wednesday, the same day West went after Khalifa in a rambling Twitter rant after some misunderstanding about the meaning of ""KK"" (weed, not Kim Kardashian). The ""Yeezus"" rapper not only brought Rose -- who dated both Khalifa and West -- into the argument, but also her and Khalifa's child, Sebastian. ""I would never talk about kids in an argument. It just shows what type of person he is,"" Rose said. ""Even him saying stuff about my son, I still didn't say anything about his kids. I'm not going to. They are innocent babies. You don't ever talk about a baby, ever, ever. That just shows how fucking ridiculous he is."" She said she wasn't surprised by his outburst because he's a ""fucking clown."" Rose said the only reason she tweeted about West was because he brought up her son. ""The crazy thing is, he came out with a song last week saying I had my son for a meal ticket and I didn't even say anything,"" she continued. ""You took me around the world, we dated for, like, two years, but you're talking shit about Wiz and my baby ... I mean, he still talks about me in songs, he still talks about me all day.

Doug Ducey (R) and lawmakers for the state announced a partnership on Thursday to introduce legislation in Congress to sever ties with the appellate court once and for all -- with their sights set on joining up with another circuit or creating a brand new one just for them.“Arizonans deserve better than this from the people in power, and that includes a judicial process that is judicious in nature,” Ducey said in the announcement, which was backed by fellow Arizona Republicans Sen. Jeff Flake and Rep. Matt Salmon. “It’s time that Congress takes overdue action to resolve this crisis in our courts -- and I’m proud to join a strong coalition of Arizona leaders stepping up to facilitate the process in Washington.”Ducey said the reason for the overhaul was the 9th Circuit’s reputation as “the most overturned and overburdened court in the country,” and that the court’s “voluminous caseload and disproportionate size” essentially meant justice delayed for Arizona residents.“This circuit is overloaded hugely and it's larger than any other circuit, larger than several combined, so it needs to be split off. So, I'm glad to make another push,” Flake said, referencing prior failed attempts to reform the 9th Circuit, whose jurisdiction is by far the most geographically vast in the country.Arizona’s move isn’t unprecedented. Bills going as far back as 1983 have aimed to break up the 9th Circuit. One ambitious 1999 proposal sought to reorganize it into regions and remake its judicial governance from the ground up.But where those efforts seemed pragmatic, more recent history strongly suggests that politics rather than a concern for judicial efficiency is the reason for the renewed focus on the court.Almost 10 years ago to the day, conservative outcry against the the liberal 9th Circuit -- which covers the entire West Coast, plus Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii and a couple of territories -- led to congressional action to split it in two. But the efforts never went anywhere.Flake insisted that ""due process"" for litigants, and not politics or dislike for the court's rulings, were the motivating factors for getting Arizona out of the 9th Circuit this time around.But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who wasn’t part of Ducey's announcement but supports the proposed shakeup, was more blunt about what leaving the court would mean for the state.“I'm all for it. I've been for it for years,” McCain told The Huffington Post. “[It’s] come up many times before, for years.” He added that anyone who has closely followed the decisions of the court “wants to get the hell out” of its jurisdiction.In a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership in October, Ducey said Congress should consider ""realigning"" Arizona in the more conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, or else create a brand new circuit encompassing Arizona and other ""non-coastal states.""Arizona has a bruising history with the 9th Circuit, in large part because its judges on numerous occasions have ruled state legislation unconstitutional or dismissed lawsuits by local officials. And the Supreme Court, for the most part, has let those rulings stand.Perhaps the greatest bench-slap Arizona received in recent memory was when the Supreme Court struck down key parts of its controversial ""show me your papers"" law, which was touted by Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio and unduly targeted Latinos and immigrants.""The Government of the United States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy said in the ruling, reminding Arizona who has the ultimate authority over immigration matters. (The 9th Circuit had earlier blocked the most contested parts of the law.) But Arizona has had other run-ins with the appeals court, such as when it tried but failed to convince its judges it should be able to deny driver's licenses to DREAMers, to implement a constitutional amendment that would've stripped bail access from undocumented immigrants or to allow a wholesale ban on ethnic studies at Arizona schools. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court tossed a request by Arpaio to review his lawsuit over President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration -- already the locus of another multi-state case the justices will hear in the spring. Arizona is involved in that case, too.To be sure, the Supreme Court itself has had issues with the 9th Circuit's decision-making. In 2010, one of its judges lamented that, in a 10-year span, the ""court got it wrong"" in 81 percent of the cases that reached the high court. Other circuits had an average reversal rate of 71 percent.The difference is notable, but not extraordinary. And, all told, it could be attributable to the factors Ducey and Flake pointed out, like workload and its massive jurisdiction. All of that is independent of any grievances Arizona may have with the 9th Circuit's rulings. ""We’ve seen these efforts before from Republicans in recent years, and the intent is always the same: To break up a court that they tend to disagree with,"" said Kyle Barry of Alliance for Justice, a left-leaning advocacy group of more than 100 organizations focused on the judiciary. ""They complain about consistency in the court, yet want to dismantle an entire circuit because they don’t like its decisions.""Sidney Thomas, the court's chief judge, did not return a request for comment from The Huffington Post. But U.S. Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, who led the 9th Circuit until 2014, lauded prior chief judges who fought back congressional attempts to break up ""this great circuit of ours.""Cristian Farias reported from New York; Jennifer Bendery reported from Washington."

She was one of 32 students and faculty killed that day, in what remains the nation’s deadliest shooting rampage by a single gunman.“Hillary Clinton is addressing the issue of gun violence prevention,” Read says in the ad. “It’s clear from the way she talks about it that she’s talking from conviction, and I do think Hillary Clinton has been very forthright in calling out the leadership of these organizations like the NRA.”“I wish we never had to talk about it, but we have to talk about it, and she is,” he adds.The web spot, called “Conviction,” was first shared with The Huffington Post. It is the third in a series released by the super PAC, which spent six figures on ads ahead of the Iowa caucus Monday. The other spots in the series were 30 seconds long and each highlights multiple issues, from Clinton’s stance on Wall Street reform to Planned Parenthood funding, so this third spot is unique in that it's 60 seconds and focuses on a single issue.Clinton’s campaign and her allies have worked to draw contrasts between her record on gun safety and that of her main competitor for the nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). While Sanders has repeatedly said that he has a D- rating from the NRA and supports banning assault weapons and instituting universal background checks, Clinton has highlighted his vote in 2005 to shield gun makers and dealers from legal liability, and a vote against the Brady bill in 1993 that created the federal background checks system. Clinton frequently criticizes the NRA for its advocacy against gun control of any kind as she campaigns, and has called for a “national movement” to convince lawmakers that more should be done. Read was at the White House earlier this month alongside President Barack Obama as he announced new steps his administration would take to strengthen background checks and devote additional funding to mental health services.“Peter Read is one of too many parents who have suffered in a way that no one ever should,” said Guy Cecil, Priorities USA’s chief strategist. “We need leaders like Hillary Clinton who aren’t afraid to stand strong against powerful special interests like the NRA and politicians who do their bidding in the face of these senseless acts of violence.”Also on HuffPost:"

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton might face problems in a general election. And the American Association for Public Opinion Research releases a set of election polling explainers. This is HuffPollster for Friday, January 29, 2016.WATCH OUT FOR SURPRISES IN IOWA - Leonid Bershidsky: “J. Ann Selzer, who has conducted polling on the Iowa caucuses since 1988, says the contests almost always yield surprises….Iowa governor Terry Branstad predicts that this time, 150,000 Republicans are likely to turn out, energized by [Donald] Trump's candidacy….On the other hand, if the commitment of these political neophytes doesn't extend to actually journeying out in the cold night and spending several hours caucusing in a classroom or barn, it will be [Ted] Cruz who will get a boost. [Bernie] Sanders' ability to beat [Hillary] Clinton also hinges on how organized and civic-minded his young supporters turn out to be….That, however, doesn't mean that Trump and Sanders will triumph….A surge of voters from the center that lifts Clinton and Marco Rubio, the front-runner among mainstream Republicans, may be the biggest surprise for the pollsters this year.” [Bloomberg]Rubio has been rising slightly - While much of the focus has been on Trump and Cruz, the Florida senator has been picking up a little steam in the polls. The HuffPost Pollster average shows a small uptick in Rubio’s Iowa numbers in the last few weeks. How much has he gained? - The latest NBC/WSJ/Marist poll in Iowa shows Rubio in third place with 18 percent -- a 5-percentage point improvement over the last NBC/WSJ/Marist poll in early January. The poll also shows evidence that measurements of Rubio’s support could be influenced by pollsters’ assumptions about turnout: Marist samples using random digit dial methods, but then matches the sample to a voter list. Random digit dialing involves calling randomly selected telephone numbers to reach a random sample of Americans, but some pollsters sample from lists of registered voters instead for pre-election polls. Voter lists have been found to be more accurate for polling elections, since they allow pollsters to check who's actually registered to vote, and often how they do so. Among those respondents who could be matched to the voter list in the newest NBC/WSJ/Marist poll, Rubio took second place with 22 percent. His support dropped to 14 percent among those who couldn’t be matched to the list. On the other hand, Rubio’s numbers have remained stable in the latest Monmouth University poll, which samples from a voter list. Monmouth actually reported the horserace numbers for several different levels of turnout varying from low to high, but in these calculations Rubio’s support levels are mostly unaffected turnout -- he stays around 16 percent. [Marist, Monmouth]Sanders and Clinton remain deadlocked. - New polls from Monmouth and NBC/WSJ/Marist show Clinton with a 5-point and 3-point lead respectively, but with other polls showing mixed results, the HuffPost Pollster average has Clinton up by just a single point. [Marist, Monmouth, HuffPost]TRUMP COULD FACE A CHALLENGING GENERAL ELECTION - Nate Cohn: ""Donald Trump’s path to the Republican nomination has become a lot clearer over the last month….Mr. Trump has benefited greatly from receiving the preponderance of news media coverage since entering the race. And it has also helped that the Republican candidates have largely shied away from attacking him. But it’s an open question whether Mr. Trump could retain all of this strength in the face of concerted and coordinated attacks against him. He simply hasn’t faced anything like it."" [NYT]Little evidence Trump could win in a general election - Amy Walter: ""I have no idea what is going to happen in Iowa and New Hampshire. If the polls are correct, Donald Trump is on his way to victory in both states. On the Democratic side, Iowa is a coin-toss and Bernie Sanders wins big in New Hampshire. For many Republicans, Cruz represents an obvious - and predictable - road to a loss in November: a conservative and ideologically rigid message to a shrinking base of voters. Meanwhile, Trump represents the audacity of hope, an opportunity to appeal to a crop of voters who’ve either sat on the sidelines or voted Democratic in the past. Even many Democrats worry that they don’t have the playbook to deal with Trump. But winning over GOP voters is NOT the same as winning a national election."" [Cook Political] HILLARY CLINTON HAS AN ELECTABILITY PROBLEM - HuffPollster: ""Hillary Clinton may have something of an electability problem. The problem is not that Democratic voters don't think she's electable. It's that they don't care who's electable. That's too bad for Clinton, since she's made electability a cornerstone of her campaign….HuffPost teamed with YouGov to probe the views of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. What we found is that only 8 percent say they're backing somebody who isn't their top choice, but whom they see as more electable. Sixty-two percent say they're supporting their favorite candidate regardless of that consideration, while the rest are undecided or don't plan to vote….A majority of all Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters -- 54 percent -- now say that Clinton's chief rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is in fact electable.""

INACCURACIES IN POLLS ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED - David Dutwin: ""Polling is under siege. Recent failures in election polling in Britain, Israel and a few high-profile states in the U.S. midterm elections have been squarely attributed to an increased unwillingness of many Americans to take surveys (what the industry terms 'declining response rates')....Yet, with apologies to Mark Twain, the simple truth is that the death of probability-based, scientifically rigorous and highly precise polling has been greatly exaggerated. Polls serve a critical role in democracy and, contrary to noisy critics, continue to provide highly accurate estimates of public sentiment. Recent research into Pew Research Center, ABC-Washington Post and CBS-New York Times telephone polling finds little growth in inaccuracies in polls over the past 20 years, despite response rates having dropped from the 30 percent range to the single digits. Indeed, reported estimates show absolutely no increase in bias."" [WashPost]AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC RESEARCH CREATES A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING 2016 POLLS - AAPOR: ""With this year’s unusually contentious presidential race comes an unusually loud chorus of criticism about the accuracy and impact of election polling.

David Perdue is blocking his own judicial nominee, Dax Lopez, over immigration reform.",2016-01-29,Georgia Sen. David Perdue doesn't like that his Latino judicial nominee was part of a Latino group that advocated for Latino issues.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56abacdd1a00001001ab1984.jpeg?ops=crop_0_108_4365_2802%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) just torpedoed his own judicial nominee, Dax Lopez, a conservative Republican who was on track to become Georgia's first-ever Latino federal judge. His reason? Lopez used to be a member of an organization of Latino elected officials that opposed the state's controversial immigration law.Perdue originally recommended Lopez to President Barack Obama for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Obama nominated him in July 2015, with Perdue's blessing and the support of Georgia's other Republican senator, Johnny Isakson. Lopez was reviewed extensively and has since been waiting for his hearing before the Judiciary Committee.But Perdue now says he won't be turning in his so-called blue slip to the committee, which means Lopez's nomination is dead. It's an unofficial rule that the committee chairman won't give a nominee a hearing until both of his or her home-state senators submit their blue slips -- literally, they are blue pieces of paper -- to signal that they're ready to move forward. In a statement last week, Perdue said he is ""uncomfortable"" with the fact that Lopez was a member of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, which in 2011 strongly opposed a bill, and now law, that empowers state police to question anyone about their immigration status. Lopez, who has been a DeKalb County state judge since 2010, left the group in September.""I am particularly concerned with his continued participation with this organization and his public comments after he became a state judge,"" Perdue said. ""I thank Judge Lopez for his service to the people of DeKalb County, but I am unable to support his nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia moving forward.""His change of heart on Lopez caught some people off guard, including Isakson, who said it was the wrong move.""I respect his decision, but I think he should have had a hearing,"" Isakson told The Huffington Post on Thursday. ""He was vetted thoroughly before he was nominated, so he's a good man.""HuffPost caught up with Perdue and asked why he wouldn't give Lopez a hearing so he could at least answer questions about his role at GALEO. That's what Lopez himself has said is the most frustrating aspect of it all.""Part of my responsibility as a member of the committee is that, if I blue slip a person, I feel like I have to support that person,"" Perdue said.That's not true, though. Agreeing to give someone a hearing doesn't mean you have to vote for them. It just means they get a hearing. Perdue disagreed.""No, I felt like I have that responsibility to the committee,"" he said. ""If I'm not going to support the nominee, why would I recommend him for a hearing?""When HuffPost said doing so would let the full committee decide if Lopez should move forward, Perdue was done with the conversation.""Well, that was my decision. Thank you,"" he said, walking away.Perdue's move has infuriated civil rights and Latino groups such as the Hispanic National Bar Association. ""We find it difficult to see how his association with GALEO can be somehow disqualifying. Our only inference is that he's unacceptable to Senator Perdue because he is a Latino who believes in Latino participatory democracy,"" said its president, Robert Maldonado.Some Republican state officials, though, are with Perdue.""This organization has strongly supported amnesty for illegal aliens and seeks to end the enforcement of America's immigration laws,"" Georgia state Sen. John Albers said in a statement. ""Both by word and action, Judge Lopez has routinely demonstrated that he identifies with the philosophical position of this group.""With Lopez sidelined, that leaves an uncertain fate for a court seat that's already been vacant for more than 550 days. It's also on a court so overwhelmed with work it's been deemed a judicial emergency, meaning each judge is juggling more than 600 cases or 430 to 600 cases for more than 18 months.The drama over Lopez comes as Senate Republicans have drastically slowed down the pace of confirming federal judges at all -- an effort to prevent Obama from putting his nominees on courts. They let only 11 judges get confirmed last year, which is the fewest in more than half a century. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) agreed to let five judicial nominees get votes in the early part of 2016, but it's unclear what will happen after that. Some conservative groups are pressuring Republicans to halt confirmations entirely.Also on HuffPost:"
31,POLITICS,"In An Immigration Debate Focused On Borders And Walls, Asians Often Get Left Out",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/asian-immigrants-undocumented_us_56ab9b79e4b077d4fe8dcea3,Which makes little sense if you look at the numbers.,2016-01-29,"Jose Antonio Vargas, who ""came out"" as undocumented in 2011, is from the Philippines.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_38_119_2349_1475%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Conservative rabble-rouser Ann Coulter unwittingly summed up one misunderstanding about undocumented immigrants in America earlier this week, when she suggested ""we put a few of them on buses.""Her tweet referenced ""that illegal who 'lives in the shadows' with his own show on MTV"" -- presumably referring to journalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas, who is undocumented and whose film ""White People"" aired on the network. But Coulter either didn't know or didn't care that if Vargas were to be deported, it couldn't be by bus. He was born in the Philippines. Immigration, especially unauthorized immigration, is often framed as a Latino or, specifically, Mexican issue. There are many examples of this: Coulter summing up deportation as a matter of putting people on buses, politicians pivoting directly to security along the southern border when asked about immigration policy, and media focusing on whether Latino voters are swayed by such policies. Asian immigrants, by contrast, are usually left out of the discussion -- even though they make up the fastest-growing undocumented population and are expected to surpass Latinos as the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by mid-century. Asian-Americans are also becoming a larger proportion of the electorate, and some Democratic politicians have made an effort to target them. But they don't get the same level of attention as Latino voters. Vargas is trying to bring Asian immigrants into the conversation. ""We have so relegated this to a border issue, to a Mexican issue, to a brown issue, that we are not seeing the global view,"" Vargas said. ""I think that is a danger."" He came to the U.S. from the Philippines when he was 12 years old, and has been living here without authorization since. Vargas, now 34, ""came out"" as undocumented in 2011 and then founded a group called Define American that seeks to reshape the immigration debate, in part by highlighting a wider array of stories.Last weekend, the group held a film festival in Iowa that featured movies not just about Latinos -- who currently make up the largest proportion of undocumented and legal immigrants in the U.S. -- but also people from Asia and Africa. One movie screened was ""The Joy Luck Club,"" a story about Chinese-American women and their immigrant mothers. Janet Yang, a producer of the 1993 movie who participated in a panel at the festival, said by phone that it's even harder now than it was then to get a film like ""The Joy Luck Club"" made. That's a loss for everyone, she said. ""It's something that is just so good for America to be reminded of these stories and how rich this country is because of it,"" said Yang, who is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. It is ironic how invisible Asian immigrants are in the debate now, when earlier immigration laws, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, were largely shaped around arguments over admitting people from China and Japan, said historian Erika Lee, who wrote The Making of Asian America: A History and also appeared on the panel. When Asian immigrants are mentioned these days, it's often as the ""model minority"" or ""model immigrant,"" she told HuffPost, which pits them against Latino immigrants in a way that is harmful for both populations. ""It further demonizes Latino immigration and it also helps deflect from the problems Asian immigrants do continue to have,"" Lee said. Asians and Pacific Islanders make up more than 80 percent of the people in the government's employment visa backlogs, according to Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. They also account for more than 40 percent of the people waiting for family immigrant visas. ""This is significant, but few know that these backlogs force so many AAPI [Asian-American and Pacific Islander] families to be separated from their loved ones for decades at a time,"" she said in an email. Chu also noted that undocumented young people from Asian and Pacific Island nations make up only 2.6 percent of recipients of deportation relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, even though they account for about 8 percent of those eligible. ""In order to truly raise more awareness about our community, we need the media to help us share AAPI stories and to provide a more holistic narrative of those impacted by our broken immigration system,"" Chu said. ""It is through these stories that we can ensure that Asians and Pacific Islanders are no longer rendered invisible in our push for comprehensive immigration reform.""Also on HuffPost:"
