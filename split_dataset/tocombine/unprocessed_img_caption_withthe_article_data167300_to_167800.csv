0,PARENTING,10 Steps to Ensure Your Kids Will Need Post-Holiday Therapy,"Bethany Meyer, Contributor
Blogger, I Love Them the Most When They're Sleeping",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/holiday-stress_us_5b9cafeae4b03a1dcc80e18a,"Take a family picture with the tree before it's bailed and strapped to the minivan roof. Promise the kids that you will decorate the tree tonight. When you arrive home, ask your husband to put the tree in a bucket in the backyard. Forget to check to see if he has put water in the bucket.",2013-01-04,"Young girl helping her mother decorating the Christmas tree, holding some Christmas baubles in her hand (Focus on bauble)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cafea2000003100fdac4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"1. Reserve a weekend in December for the annual choosing and cutting down of the Christmas tree. Make sure to choose a tree farm almost an hour's drive north. On the day you make the trip, bring a friend of your oldest son's along. Because six people weighing in on a tree could lead to a dreaded tie. You'll need the extra set of eyeballs... just in case.2. Arrive at dusk on a rainy, overcast Saturday, just as they are closing. Look at your husband in disbelief when he tells you we've been turned away ""for legal reasons."" Some nonsense about navigating the farm in the dark and the possibility of falling in holes. Leave without a tree. Take the five children to Dairy Queen and give them each a Blizzard for dinner. Hock a loogie into your husband's Blizzard when he isn't looking. After all, if he hadn't tried to reclaim his youth by organizing that tackle football game in your backyard with the 5th grade boys, you'd have been there before closing -- and left with a tree.3. Wake up early Sunday morning. Pack coats, hats, gloves, doughnuts, water, baby wipes and children into the minivan. Arrive at the tree farm an hour north for the second time in 14 hours. Watch in horror as the children leap from the car directly into the mud because you've forgotten to pack their rain boots.4. Walk to the farthest left corner of the tree farm with your husband, who amuses himself by pinching your butt cheek every 4-5 trees. Refrain from tackling your two older sons when, with ninja-like stealth, they jump out from behind a tree and scare the be-Jesus out of you. Keep your face expressionless when your two younger sons hand you a dozen colored tags that they've pulled from trees other people have marked and paid for already. Nonchalantly toss the tags into the nearest hole. Kick mud into the hole to bury the evidence. Point to the nearest tree and tell your husband, ""cut it down fast before they kick us the fuck out of here!""5. Take a family picture with the tree before it's bailed and strapped to the minivan roof. Promise the kids that you will decorate the tree tonight. When you arrive home, ask your husband to put the tree in a bucket in the backyard. Forget to check to see if he has put water in the bucket. Be too tired to decorate the tree that night.6. Put the tree up five days later. Play Christmas music. Make hot chocolate with marshmallows for the kids and homemade Bailey's for you and your husband. Turn on the gas fireplace. Unwrap each ornament slowly, pause, smile, then begin the story of where each ornament came from... because every ornament has a story, and you remember each and every story. When no one, including your husband, listens to your stories... when they repeatedly interrupt you, when they rip ornaments from your hand with their dirty, ungrateful little fingers, when they fight over whose turn it is to place the star on top of the tree... tell them they are taking all of the magic out of Christmas.7. When your husband announces he will not be watering the tree this year because it's ""a waste of time,"" look at him quizzically. Narrow your eyes. In your mind's eye, recollect the year he created a device for watering trees he felt should be patented. The funnel he duct-taped to the PVC tube that allowed him to stand at his full height of 6'2"" plus an additional three feet away to water the tree without brushing against so much as one pine needle. Walk upstairs to the hall closet. Open it. Peek inside. Yep. It's still there. Nope. Still no patent. Close the closet door. Scratch your head. But, for god's sake, hold your tongue.8. Spend the next three weeks giving the tree a wide berth. Admire it from afar, as though you're a stalker. Or a peeping tom. Instruct the kids to do the same. On Christmas Eve, after the kids have gone to bed, take every piece of furniture from that room and move it as far away from that fire hazard...I mean from the tree as possible. Scowl at your husband when he raises his eyebrows and suggests you do the nasty on the carpet of razor sharp pine needles that now covers your family room rug. Leave a note for Santa to place the gifts 3-4 feet away from the tree. And, above all else, instruct him not to light his pipe until he's several houses away from that goddamn tinder box.9. Spend Christmas morning watching the joy on your kids' faces as they unwrap each of their presents. Watch those looks of joy morph into masks of pain as they slip their unsuspecting fingers into new ski gloves riddled with needles as sharp as splinters. Spend Christmas night snuggled up on the sofa with your husband. Listen to the cats chasing each other up and down the Christmas tree. Hear the sound of two million pine needles hitting the presents. Cringe at the shattering glass, as the precious ornaments... each with its own story...f all from the tree and hit the Lego sets below. Do. Not. Turn. Around. And. Look. At. The. Carnage.10. The following morning, announce that, ""we are getting that miserable excuse for a Christmas tree out of this house today."" Tell the kids to pipe down when they beg for one more day. When your husband walks past you on the way to his shed and you overhear him mutter, ""I just need my chainsaw,"" take a tug of that Bailey's. It matters not that it's only 8:30 a.m.. Chainsaw + Christmas tree + Family Room = No one will judge you. When he returns to the house with a pair of pruning shears, breathe a sigh of relief. Keep the children occupied while he desecrates the Christmas tree that you grabbed in a flash... I mean that they chose so lovingly. After he's hacked off every single branch, beg him not to show the children the naked trunk that used to be their beloved Christmas tree. Dry their tears and offer hugs of compassion when he disregards your plea because he believes, ""this is one of the greatest ideas I've ever had."" Silently vow to head directly to Target to purchase an artificial tree on clearance the minute they are all back in school.Follow these 10 steps to ensure your kids too will need post-holiday therapy.

Here's one way to begin: Dump your list of resolutions.People are remarkably bad at remembering long lists of goals. I learned this at a professional level when trying to get my high-performance coaching clients to stay on track; the longer their lists of to-dos and goals, the more overwhelmed and off-track they got. Clarity comes with simplicity. As marketers and neuroscientists have also shown, the more choices we have the less likely we are to take action. The solution was to teach people to adopt key themes into their lives rather than lists.So, for 2013, what are the three themes you're going to use to guide your personal behavior? My three themes, for example, are presence, boldness, and enthusiasm. These will be my daily focal points. Watch the video in this post for how these themes can help you make 2013 your best year yet.

But even as the community inched back to normal, reminders of the Dec. 14 massacre that claimed the lives of 20 first-graders and six adults were everywhere.For parents of the surviving students, there was a lingering anguish over how much their children understand and how it may have changed them.Syeda Suriya Ahmed said her 6-year-old son, Mamnun, a first-grader, has suffered nightmares since the shooting. A few days ago, he drew a picture of an adult lying in a pool of blood and told his mother it was a picture of his principal.Ahmed, who came to Connecticut from Bangladesh 15 years ago, said her son speaks occasionally about the gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, by name. Lanza shot himself dead following the rampage.""How can he know that?"" Ahmed asked. She said she has been careful not to talk about the shooting in front of her son.A gregarious and playful child, Mamnun said he likes computers, and after school on Thursday he giggled happily as he played with a photographer's camera.His mother said Mamnun has talked a lot about the shooting.""He didn't want to go to school this morning. He was scared about the police,"" Ahmed recalled as she served her son a bowl of pasta as an after-school snack.Memories of the tragedy continue to haunt Ahmed as well. After first becoming aware that a shooting had occurred at the school, she said she had to wait an agonizing 90 minutes before learning that her son was unharmed.Once parents were allowed to pick up their children, Ahmed - who does not drive - had to knock on the doors of three neighbors before finding someone who could drive her to the fire station where children evacuated from the school had been taken.""How can this happen at a school? All those innocent children, how can it happen?"" she said.Anca Roberto said her 5-year-old daughter, a kindergartner, knew only that ""something bad"" had happened at school. In a way, her daughter was lucky to be young enough so that the magnitude of what happened would not register.""We talked to counselors about how to deal with this. If she asks, answer. But we don't want to push the envelope,"" Roberto said. (Reporting by Edith Honan; Editing by Steve Gorman and Lisa Shumaker)"

There are two reasons why cliff divers may sail off into empty space with relative equanimity. The first is that they know how to dive, and thus their descent, barring calamity, is both targeted and controlled. It is not the haphazard, sprawling belly flop the fiscal cliff seems to signify.But that is the lesser of the reasons why that flight from the cliff face may be expected to end well. The greater reason resides at the bottom, in a pool of water. In fact, it is the pool.The pool has equally profound implications for the cliff that currently imperils our economy and bedevils our government, but for the balm of a temporizing remedy. In this case, though, it is a pool of money.The average cost of bringing a new FDA-approved drug to market has long exceeded $500 million. That cost encompasses drug development, and the rigorous sequence of testing required to show both that a drug works as intended, and is suitably safe. Even despite the time and money the process requires, the outcomes -- as we all have cause to know -- are not completely reliable. Perhaps, then, the price tag should be even higher?As for breakthroughs in basic biomedical research -- the kind that truly promise to change the human condition for the better, and engender Nobel prizes -- they may cost more, evolving slowly from an insight, through years of painstaking toil, to clinical utility at long last and great expense.The point of which is: Not even a vanishingly small percentage of the tiny percentage of the richest people among us could even dream of funding such an effort personally. Almost no one who would stand to benefit from -- indeed, whose life might one day depend on -- a critical biomedical advance could afford to pay a fraction of its costs. That vanishingly tiny sliver of the population that could do so is unlikely to, for a number of reasons. The timeline for nurturing biomedical breakthroughs exceeds individual patience. The identification of appropriate candidate projects requires expertise extreme wealth does not confer. And to whatever extent the super-wealthy might underwrite biomedical research, one may presume they would fund projects of personal interest, rather than those of greatest potential benefit to the population.To which I say: Thank goodness for the pool! For that's what the aggregation of tax revenue used to subsidize the NIH, the CDC, and the FDA is. A pool of funds in support of critical work on which lives -- perhaps our own, perhaps those of people we love -- might depend. Work that almost no individual could support, and no individual would.The obligatory spending cuts onto which a fiscal cliff dive would flop us all include huge reductions in the budgets for the NIH, the CDC, the FDA, and other federal health agencies. That might sound fine to you because it might mean you get to keep a bit more of your own money. It might sound good to have lower taxes. It might sound good until the day you need a treatment that doesn't exist -- because nobody funded its development. None of us is an island.So hanging on to a bit more of our money might sound good until the day of reckoning, whenever and however it arrives, when our flight is ending and our landing becomes salient. At that point, we are apt to find ourselves wishing for... a pool.-finDr. David L.

This morning, as I was scooping my dog's poop, I realized that I could take a few lessons from my dog...Always ready. Gingi could be fast asleep on her bed, but the minute she hears a footstep or a door open, she is up and frisky and eager to go. There's no ramp-up time in the morning. No complaints about not getting enough sleep or being tired at the end of a long day or too busy with something else.Never lazy. Even if she is comfortably snuggling on the couch with the family, if the doorbell rings, Gingi is the first one up to see who is there. If I'm comfy on the couch, I pause in hope that someone else will get the door, or answer the phone, or check the oven when the timer goes off.Enjoy food. Even though she eats the same food every day, Gingi is always excited at mealtime. I'm not saying that I should eat the exact same food every day, but I don't take pleasure the way that she does.Ask for what you want. When Gingi wants to play, she brings her ball to the back door or nuzzles into your lap. When she wants to go out, she barks by the door. When she's thirsty, she stands over her water bowl, then paws it if we take too long to notice. If I am hugging my husband or one of my daughters, she always nudges her way into the embrace for her share of the love. I frequently find it hard to ask for help or attention, hoping that my husband or children will read my mind or simply figure it out for themselves.Hold no grudges. It's been a busy week, so I haven't spent any time in the yard with her, despite her daily attempts. She is always eager to play no matter what happened yesterday, or even five minutes ago. No pouting or withholding because she didn't get what she wanted.Relax. If there is one lesson that I really need to learn from Gingi, it's the ability to simply relax and be. No agenda. No goals. No guilt. Simple, pure enjoyment of life.As for that poop part of her life... well, there's a lot to be said for high-fiber and no junk food, which she proves to me twice every day.For more by Marjoy Abrams, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."
6,DIVORCE,What To Do When Your Partner is Thinking Of Leaving,"Andrea Wachter, Contributor

Man packing his clothes into suitcase, sad woman hugging pillow in the background. Selective focus on woman.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9caa1d240000300094c546.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It seems to me in our great grandparents and grandparents' era, people seemed to stay together no matter what. In today's fast moving, perfectionistic world, people seem quick to leave no matter what. In my therapy practice, I often help ambivalent clients differentiate between deal-breakers and deal-makers. Should they stay or should they go? And of course, we talk about the grass needing maintenance on the other side of the fence as well. If your partner is thinking of leaving you, here are some tips to help you navigate this painful chapter.Know That It's Not All Your Fault: Despite what your partner may say, the fact that they are thinking of leaving you is not all your fault! I am sure you have some relationship patterns to change -- we all do -- but the fact that they are considering giving up on the relationship is not (and I repeat not) all about you. Your partner may have issues with some of the things you do, but a healthy and committed partner tells you about them respectfully, remains open to working on them and decides which issues are essential to change and which ones they can live with and accept.Do look at your part in the relationship struggles. It doesn't mean you are a bad person. It simply means you are a teachable person who is willing to grow and change. Over time you will find out if your partner is willing to grow and change as well. Stay In the Moment: The natural tendency in a life crisis like this is to fret about the future. But you never know what may happen. I have seen couples make it and thrive after infidelity. I have seen partners who didn't think they could survive a break up be the ones to make the final decision to leave and end up happier. The bottom line is that you have no idea how this is all going to turn out. Just do what's right in front of you and when the time comes to make a decision, in that moment, you will know. Much like reeling in a fishing line, we all need to learn how to reel our ever so creative and active minds back to the present moment. The stories and scenarios we create seem so real, they actually cause us to have feelings about things that haven't even happened. Catch yourself when you can and reel yourself back to actual -- factual -- reality.Don't Make Any Major Decisions: Don't even buy a new washer and dryer right now! The only thing you need to do is your basic self-care and necessary responsibilities. Continuously ask yourself, ""What do I need to do to take care of myself and my children?"" When enough time, tears and tantrums pass, you will be clear about what to do. Making a decision from the place you and your partner are in right now is likely to be reactive, rather than rational. Unless your partner is abusive and/or an addict (and unwilling to work on it), I recommend that you give this process enough time to make sure you are a making a well thought out decision.There is nowhere to go that will be magically easy or bring permanent happiness. Unless you are both perfectly clear that the relationship is over, or there is abuse (in which case it should be), this relationship might be worth waiting for. The decision will unfold and become clear over time.Don't Be Your Partner's Therapist: Your partner may be confused and in a lot of pain right now, but you are not the best person for them to sort this out with. You both need safe, objective, loving and forthright people to support each of your very different needs. It's not good for you to be constantly hearing every detail of your partner's ambivalence about the relationship and it's not good for them to be hearing the daily details of your emotional pain. If it feels productive and important for you to hear some of your partner's grievances, and you can still maintain your sense of self, then do that. However, if you feel like you are turning into a therapist or a punching bag, it is best for you to set some limits. Don't Turn to Addictions for Comfort: Many people want to turn to addictive habits for comfort at a time like this. And while they do provide short-term relief, they will surely lead to long-term grief. Are you numbing your feelings with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, shopping, gambling, food, diets, purging, or obsessing on your appearance? Are you excessively exercising, or using your TV or computer until you're zoned out? Are you preoccupied with another relationship? Even depression can be a way to numb out and avoid painful emotions. The truth is that it's hard to feel emotional pain and it's hard to feel the consequences of addictive habits intended to avoid emotional pain. However, only one will lead you out and through while the other is a dead-end road of anesthetization. Once you find the right kind of support and build a tolerance for feeling difficult emotions, you will see that all feelings eventually pass. You can learn to receive comfort externally from others and internally from yourself.Don't Lose Yourself: When a person is at risk of being left, their basic sense of value is extremely threatened. The natural tendency is to wait, like an innocent puppy, to see if its owner is going to come back. What once may have been an equal playing field between partners can turn into a one-way power play, with all the power in the hands of the person considering leaving. Who would want to be left? Who would want to be potentially rejected by someone you love? But love, in spite of countless poems and country-western songs, is not enough. It takes shared values, commitment, maturity, spirituality, communication and grit (from both partners!) to make a long-term relationship live a long and healthy life.While it is important to stay open to working on relationship issues if your partner is willing to respectfully discuss them, it is equally essential that you stop putting all your focus on your partners wants, needs and feelings and begin to regain your own sense of power. You were (hopefully) okay before you met your partner, and if the relationship ends, you can be okay again. Your partner may be unsure about the relationship, but what are you unsure about? What do you want? What are you unwilling to live with? What do you need to be different if the two of you were to stay together? Pursue What Brings You Joy: In addition to dealing with moment-to-moment self-care during a life crisis, it is essential that you also begin, when you are ready, to use this time as an opportunity to find things that fulfill you. Not only will this help you in the present, but it will create hope for the future. And as a bonus, people who feel joy and do things they feel passionate about are much more attractive to their partners than people who are chronically depressed and overly dependent. This may mean reestablishing things you used to be passionate about and got away from. It may mean cultivating some new interests. What did you used to love that you gave up when you met your partner? What have you always dreamed of doing but never had the time or courage to do? Whether it's a meditation or yoga class, a book club, a hiking or biking group, a new sport you've never tried, a craft, music lessons, or reconnecting with an old friend, it is critical that you find, have and/or rekindle the things that bring you joy. When we give up important parts of ourselves for a relationship and the relationship is at risk, our stability is at risk as well. When we are filled up and living a full life that we love, we may still need to grieve and face the unknown, but we will not have forsaken ourselves in the process. You might be feeling abandoned by your partner right now but you do not have to abandon yourself.Andrea Wachter is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and co-author of The Don't Diet, Live-It Workbook.

""These things happen,"" I said. ""We live in a violent world and Adam Lanza was a troubled soul."" Why focus so much attention on this one tragic incident, when in fact children die every day, all around the world, from malnutrition and neglect, abuse and war? Besides, I had Christmas shopping left to finish and time was running out.Turns out, the incident hasn't been easy to shake. Not for me and not, I suspect, for most of us. In my case, the fact that these were young children learning their letters from teachers and a principal who literally gave their lives trying to save their young charges, hit me hard. I have five children and I've been a teacher. Images of classrooms and lunchrooms, hallways and even the principal's office have been imprinted on me for the past 20 years. In my mind, I could imagine the events unfolding all too clearly. My children could have been -- could still be -- gunned down in school, on a college campus, or hell, walking across a street at the wrong time, like a friend of ours who was recently murdered in Baltimore on his way home from choir practice, or like my daughter, whose car took a bullet when she drove down the wrong city street at the wrong time of night.What message could I possibly take from Sandy Hook, except one of anger and despair? Anger, because no matter how many times this has happened in our country, people can still easily buy weapons and ammunition of the sort nobody should use outside of war. Despair, because innocent people are murdered every day as a result of this nation's love affair with guns.But it turns out that there is a very different message to take away, a message of hope that I hope to send to others. This is what hope looks like: A delegation of students who survived the 2005 school shootings on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota making their way to Newtown, Connecticut, to comfort the grieving community of Sandy Hook Elementary School. The former Red Lake students are now in their 20's, and they drove 1,500 miles to carry the message that life can, and must, go on, and that there is joy even after your darkest hours. ""We know exactly what those kids and families are going through,"" Leah Cook, who was 16 at the time, told an AP reporter. Cook, who still has a mark where a bullet grazed her leg as she fled her classroom, added, ""We want to share with them what we went through and show them that there's hope and let them know they're not alone.""What gave the Red Lake students the idea that they could, and should, make this trip? They were doing what Columbine High School students did for them, after they survived their own school shooting in 1999. When the Red Lake delegation went to Newtown, they met with Sandy Hook Elementary School families and teachers with a dream catcher, tribal flags signed by kids from their school and a memorial plaque that the Columbine students had given the Red Lake students in 2005, with the understanding that they would pass it on if there were ever another school shooting. Where there is despair, there is hope -- if we can come together to grieve, to comfort one another and to shine light into our darkest corners. My message? Reach out and comfort someone today. Spread hope, and there will be less room in this world for darkness."

He simply sat there as if Santa's lap was a chair like any other.",2013-01-03,"Santa Claus decorations are pictured on December 4, 2012 at the Galeries Lafayette Paris department store, ahead of the Christmas celebrations. AFP PHOTO MIGUEL MEDINA (Photo credit should read MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cae992200005600d955c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's a patch of green space about half a block from my house called Fireman's Park, named for the big metal bell that sits in the center as a memorial to firemen killed in the line of duty. Every Christmas, our fire department puts up a manger alongside the bell, replete with the baby Jesus, the wise men, a goat and a donkey, and they string multi-colored lights all along the perimeter of the park. On Christmas Eve, four fire trucks pull up to the park, sirens blaring, and one of the firemen, who is dressed as Santa Claus, descends from the hook and ladder. He then takes a seat by the bell, and children wait in line for an opportunity to sit on his lap and tell him what they want for Christmas.This year, I took my 23-month-old son, Eddie, to meet him. Eddie had been coughing for the last several days, the kind of cough that sounds like a barking seal, but I thought seeing Santa would cheer him up. As we waited on line, eating ginger snaps and drinking warm cider, we bumped into a boy from Eddie's class, whose father told me his son had croup but that he had gone to school for several days before being diagnosed. It's highly contagious, the father added. So that's what my son has, I thought. Sometimes, your child's diagnosis comes not from your own doctor, but from the doctor of the kid who got him sick.As we talked, a stout woman with a ponytail and glasses walked down the line telling everyone, ""Santa has a hernia. He can't have anyone on his lap.""By the time we reached Santa, it was raining.""Is it true, you have a hernia?"" I asked Santa, holding Eddie in the air above the man's lap.He didn't answer. He just reached his arms out for my son and sat him on his knee.""And what would you like for Christmas?"" Santa asked.Eddie had been saying, ""San-ta! San-ta!"" over and over again all week, but now that he was face-to-face with the man, he just sat there and said nothing. He didn't look particularly happy, and yet he didn't look particularly sad or frightened. He simply sat there as if Santa's lap was a chair like any other.""What would you like for Christmas, young man?"" ""Tell him what you want,"" I said.Eddie looked up at Santa and then stared out into the park. I shrugged my shoulders, snapped a photo, and then lifted my son off Santa's lap. A woman dressed as Mrs. Claus then handed Eddie a candy cane filled with green and red Spree, and I was handed a heavy paper bag whose weight made you think it was laden with all kinds of delights but I knew from having received one last year that all it contained was two delicious apples and an orange.Christmas morning, Eddie opened his gifts and then starting taking other people's gifts from under the tree, saying, ""San-ta! San-ta!"" in that syncopated manner in which people talk when they're speaking a language other than their own.A few days after Christmas, we headed upstate to visit my brother and sister. My sister's boyfriend, Rip, has broad shoulders, a white beard and moustache, rosy cheeks and a twinkle in his eye. As soon as he walked in the room, Eddie's eyes grew wide like saucers. ""San-ta! San-ta!"" he said. Rip played up the resemblance and lifted his big beefy hands in the air and pretended he had a pen in one hand and a pad in the other, and said, ""I have you on my list for next year. You better be good.""Throughout dinner, Eddie would look up at Rip and stare. Rip would then lift up his hands and pretend to make a list, and Eddie would lean over toward my husband and whisper something, though he doesn't yet speak in full sentences, so much of it was gibberish. After a while, I tried to distract Eddie from staring by placing in front of him a pooping deer I'd just bought on sale at a drug store. The deer is fed brown jelly beans, which then come out his rear end if you press down on his tail. But there was something blocking the hole through which the beans are released, and I spent much of the meal trying to dislodge the blockage.  After dinner, we went back to my brother's house for dessert. After we finished eating, my nephew brought out his hermit crab and set it on the table. It looked like just a shell until the crab began to crawl out and make its way across the table. Eddie kept saying, ""Eeew,"" and every time the crab would head toward him, Eddie would shout, ""San-ta! San-ta!"" and Rip would gently turn the hermit crab so that it veered off in another direction.Having Santa at our table put me in a dilemma. If I told Eddie that Rip wasn't really Santa, it would imply that there really was a Santa, and I wasn't sure I wanted to reinforce that notion. If I told Eddie that Rip couldn't possibly be Santa because in fact there was no such thing as Santa, it might crush his sugar-coated little heart and all his hopes and dreams. Of course, I could just let Eddie believe that Rip was Santa and that our family had really good connections. For simplicity's sake, that's just what I did.By New Year's Eve, I would have thought Eddie would have forgotten about Santa. But as I got dressed to go out, I propped Eddie up in my desk chair, and as he rifled through my desk drawer, he found my Christmas address labels, each of which had a little cartoon drawing of a snowman, a Christmas tree or Santa Claus. We'd been playing with these address labels since they arrived in late November. Every time he pulled them out of my drawer, I'd ask him which cartoon character he wanted, and once he chose, I would cut the character off the label and stick it on his hand. Santa was the perennial favorite. This particular morning, he bypassed the address labels and reached deeper into the drawer and found a set of Forever postage stamps that had Santa on them. He was about to begin sticking them all over his hands when I caught him and took the sheet away.""San-ta!!"" he shrieked. ""San-ta! San-ta!""""They're stamps!"" I said, folding them up and putting them in my pocket.That evening, we attended a New Year's Eve party down the street. There were about 10 of us seated at two tables that had been pushed together to form an ""L."" About halfway through dinner, Eddie got up from the table and even though I was seated just one chair away from him, the chairs were jammed up so close to the wall, he had to walk all the way around the entire ""L"" to reach me. He grabbed my hand and began tugging on it so that I would get up from my seat. He then pulled me to the front door, where outside, he could see the multi-colored Christmas lights of Fireman's Park. The woman hosting the party lived right across the street.""San-ta,"" he said, pointing outside. The lights obviously reminded him of the night he met Santa in the park. ""San-ta,"" he said again. He was now tugging on my arm to take him outside.""He's not out there, buddy. He'll be back next year,"" I said. I was now enlarging the myth of Santa, but my back was against the wall.Eddie began to cry, and I felt like I'd once again failed to shield him from life's disappointments. But as we walked back to the dining room, Eddie spotted the wood truck one of the dinner guests had given him earlier in the evening.""Truck!"" he said, and he sat down to play with it."
