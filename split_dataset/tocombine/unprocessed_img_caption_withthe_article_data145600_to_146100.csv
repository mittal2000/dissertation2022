Publisher, GetawayMavens.com; Northeast getaway expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/west-chester-pa-qvc_us_5b9d6c87e4b03a1dcc87d0dc,"A university town, this main street, shaded by old growth trees, is so charming it stole a whole scene in the movie Marley and Me.",2013-08-20,2013-08-09-AmericanHelicopterMuseumWestChesterPA.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-09-AmericanHelicopterMuseumWestChesterPA.jpg,"QVC prides itself on not merely selling products, but building relationships; this multi-national corporation wants customers to love the products, talk about the products, and be 100 percent happy with the products. And if not, to find out why. I'm the first to admit that I'm not a shopper, I've never watched a shopping channel and yet, after a behind the scenes tour of QVC, I admire the old-fashioned, quality-is-key, customer-is-king emphasis of this multibillion-dollar virtual mall. As the world's leading multi-media retailer, QVC streams live on TV and online, to about 100 million homes in the United States 24/7. (Worldwide, twice as many.) And with 20,000 square feet of space, it's the largest television studio on the east coast and the largest live studio -- truly live, with no delays -- in the country. Incredibly, all the action takes place in a little college town, 30 miles outside of Philadelphia, Pa.The acronym QVC stands for Quality, Value and Convenience, but at least one spouse of an addicted shopper calls it ""Quick Vanishing Cash."" Say what you will about the gauche materialism of our day, there is no disputing that QVC, purveyor of $8.5 billion worth of goods per year, is quite the undertaking, and no group of people displays more panache and fun while doing that than the hosts and celebrity presenters of QVC. Jimmy Fallon, 50 Cent, William Shatner and James Taylor have hawked products from these studio sets, some even taking calls and conducting online chats. QVC relies on celebs and product developers to serve as guest product experts. Joan Rivers has a regular gig and Justin Beiber caused chaos when he came through QVC doors and tweeted that fact out to his millions of followers. Most of the 2,300 QVC employees in Pennsylvania never show up on air, unless they inadvertently walk cross-camera, as shown in a hilarious blooper roll. It is live TV after all. One hundred merchandisers roam the world in search of superior goods; stamped with a QVC seal of approval, the company goes to great lengths to guarantee quality, testing each product to assure that it works well and that it can be packaged and sent to eager buyers countrywide without breaking. And of those products chosen, only 52 percent will have their 15 minutes of fame on TV. Other employees work the phones, maneuver robotic and hand-held cameras, analyze sales and call data second by second, field questions and comments, and feed all this back to on-air hosts who are constantly apprised, through ear mikes, of units sold, what sales tactics are working best (""whatever you said a minute ago, say it again!""), and alert them if a product is selling out. Viewers tweet, chat and post to Facebook in real time and often form the course a sales-pitch will take.Millions of people contact QVC through phone and computer, but there are several ways to get a firsthand look at this unpretentious billionaire of a business, should you find yourself in this part of the country.1. A one-hour guided studio tour ($7.50) introduces you to what goes on while the cameras roll. Popular with tech nerds, business, fashion, merchandising, and communications students and of course, fans of the show, guides like the bubbly, knowledgeable Anne Driscoll take you though observation galleries above the network of sets and within reach of NASA-like production rooms.2. Celebrity hounds will want to check the QVC website for a schedule of when their particular heartthrob will be touting his/her goods for a live audience. There are only 140 seats in an intimate theater setting and tickets are free, but as you can imagine, they are gone as soon as they become available. 3. For the ultimate QVC experience, however, go not only behind the scenes but practically in them. Every Friday, a three-hour ""All Access"" Tour ($75) brings you down to the studio itself, into one of several Green Rooms, and on live sets where you've got to move quickly and talk in whispers and sign language. You'll bounce from set to set to see how much prep work goes into each segment. Your tour ends with lunch in the commissary with some of your favorite presenters. One-hour tours daily at 10:30 a.m., Noon, 1 p.m., 2:30 p.m. and 4 p.m., $7.50. There are two three-hour all Access Tours offered every Friday; from 9 a.m. to noon and noon to 3 p.m. These are incredibly popular, and reservations are a must.  What else is there to do in the area, you may ask? Of course, there's Longwood Gardens, which are gardens the way QVC is a shopping mall, and the multi-generation Wyeth (NC, Andrew and Jamie) museum and studios, Brandywine River Museum. But there's also a quirky place a stone's throw from your car in the QVC parking lot -- the American Helicopter Museum. You can't miss this museum. It's the hangar with several large copters in front and screaming school kids making a beeline to those they can sit in. As the former MBB Helicopter Manufacturing Co., it explains why the Bells, Cobras, Boeings and Sikorskys look so at home here. The oldest is a 1946 Sikorsky S-51 the coolest, a tilt rotor Bell Boeing Osprey flown by the marines. Helicopter rides are available every other month (look online for schedule), and cost just $40 for a seven-minute ride. Not bad for a view of this beautiful region. Wed-Sat. 10am-5pm, Sun 12-5 p.m., $10 adults, $8 kids.You'll also want to stroll, shop and eat in Downtown West Chester. A university town, this main street, shaded by old growth trees, is so charming it stole a whole scene in the movie Marley and Me. You might be surprised to find world and regionally renowned shops like Eclat, regarded as ""Best Chocolate"" by Bon Appétit Magazine and called ""Celebrity Chocolate"" by the New York Times, A Taste of Olive with a bounty of infused oils and vinegars, including rare white balsamics, and Kreutz Creek Vineyards Tasting Room, which offers up sweet, light Port. (Here's a pretty impressive chocolate fondue: melt a pound of premium dark chocolate and mix with half-bottle of Kreutz Creek Port in a fondue pot. Instant raves). For a bit of U.S. history, try the Lincoln Tea Room, a former print shop where Abe Lincoln authored and copied his own biography in 1860 (considered the reason he became so popular before being elected). There are plenty of restaurants, but you can't beat Limoncello for its substantial $10.95 Italian buffet lunch with plenty of salads, fish, meat and fried and sautéed veggies. But save room for dessert; the signature frozen ""Flute"" dessert is the perfect cool and light finish to a hearty meal. With all this to do, you'll certainly want to stay nearby, right? The Warner Hotel, right in downtown West Chester, pays homage to its former life... as a movie theater. The Desmond differentiates itself from the rest of the corporate pack with four-poster canopy beds in each room. Connoisseurs of luxury country inns will love Inn at Whitewing Farm where former stables and tack rooms have been polished and fashioned up for overnight guests -- with made-to-order breakfast and round the clock snacks complimentary with each room.For more about these accommodations and more recommendations about what to see and where to eat and stay in Brandywine Valley, Pa., go to GetawayMavens.com."

2,FOOD & DRINK,America's Best Chain Steakhouses,"The Daily Meal, Contributor
All things food and drink",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americas-best-chain-steak_us_5b9d7327e4b03a1dcc8822c7,There comes a time in just about everyone's life when they feel the urge to eat some red meat.,2013-08-20,2013-08-20-6texaslandandcattleTexasLandandCattle.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-20-6texaslandandcattleTexasLandandCattle.jpg,"There comes a time in just about everyone's life when they feel the urge to eat some red meat. Sure, a supermarket steak cooked in a frying pan might suffice, but there's nothing quite like the experience of going to one of those big chain steakhouses. We've come to depend on these places for a good steak and a cold beer, enjoyed in a comfortable and just-boisterous-enough atmosphere, with an overall experience that leaves you full and content. From sea to shining sea, it's our right to have unrestricted access to chain steakhouses, darn it, and for that reason we set out to find out which are the country's best (Credit: Texas Land & Cattle).Click here to see America's Best Chain SteakhousesThere are two very different types of chain steakhouses, and for today's purposes we're ranking only one of them: the casual chains. While both Outback and Ruth's Chris specialize in steak, they couldn't be more different otherwise, so comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges. Comparing Outback to LongHorn, on the other hand, well that's something worth exploring.RELATED: America's 20 Best SteakhousesSo when you think ""chain steakhouse,"" what comes to mind? Odds are it's a rustic, masculine, most likely wooden building, emblazoned with an eye-catching, brightly lit logo. Inside, there's a bar with some TVs, plenty of comfortable seating, maybe some cattle paraphernalia on the walls (or boomerangs, in the case of Outback), neon beer signs, and a steak-heavy menu, obviously. But there are plenty of subtle differences, and no chain is exactly like any other.RELATED: A Guide to Steak CutsTo assemble our ranking of America's top chain steakhouses, we took a look at all the steakhouses across the country with more than 15 locations, and ranked them according to the variety of steaks on the menu, the quality of the meat used, the overall dining experience and atmosphere, the quality and variety of side dishes and other menu items, and additional perks like lunch deals, charitable efforts, promotions, and efforts to go above and beyond, like mentioning when specific menu items are in peak season. We assigned each of these categories a point value, tallied them up, and at the end of the day there was one clear winner.- Dan Myers, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: Is Pinkberry America's Best Frozen Yogurt?

During twice-daily venom ""milking"" shows, half a dozen snakes are pulled out of boxes and persuaded to release their poisonous fluid into containers that range from Big Gulp-size for cobras and rattlers to test tube-size for little coral snakes.

But it was never as inspiring as when my dear friend Nevia, owner of Bodhi Tree Farm, called out of the blue and asked if I could take some heirloom tomatoes that were simply too ripe to sell. She specializes in growing heirloom vegetables, especially tomatoes. My answer was: Yes, I'll take them!What I didn't expect, though, was that 120 lbs of tomatoes would soon show up at my door! My initial excitement began to turn to apprehension. Even if I managed to cook all of them before they rotted in their boxes, how was I going to preserve so much sauce?I had bought a small canning pressure cooker a few months ago. Although I had very good intentions, with my usual busy schedule I never even took it out of its box. Now I had no choice...

It took a little investigating, but I ended up finding all the information I needed on the USDA website. Now I just had to roll up my sleeves and get to work.It took me two 16-hour days to prep, cook and can my tomatoes and I ended up with only about 40 pints worth of the precious sauce -- most of which I ended up giving away! However exhausting the experience was, I found it profoundly satisfying and humbling. I felt connected to my ancestors in a way I never had before... My great-grandmother must have been doing this her whole life!Although I made several different kinds of sauces that weekend, the classic tomato sauce with basil remains my favorite. You can make it either with red or yellow heirloom tomatoes. It is perfect with pasta and some parmesan shavings. It also makes the most delicious topping for a pizza margherita; I even like to poach eggs in it, which I serve with a slice of crusty sourdough.Buon Appetito!Classic Heirloom Tomato Sauce with Fresh Basilmakes approximately 2 cups active time: 30 min3 lbs (1.4 kg) very ripe red or yellow meaty heirloom tomatoes - peeled and seeded (seeds strained and juices reserved, about 3/4 cup) 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil (see cook's note 2) 6 large garlic cloves - skinned and finely sliced 1 small bunch basil (3 oz) (85 g) - leaves removed from stems and torn in 1"" pieces 3/4 to 1 teaspoon sea salt to taste freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 teaspoon aged balsamic vinegar (preferably 20 to 25 years old)Step 1: Place the tomatoes in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped.Step 2: Heat a large heavy-bottomed soup pot at medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and garlic and sauté for 1 minute only. Add the tomatoes and reserved tomato juice and bring to a boil. As soon as the sauce reaches boiling point, reduce heat to medium to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 40 minutes to 1 hour (depending on how watery your heirlooms are) until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes separate from the olive oil, stirring from time to time. Add the basil, salt, pepper and balsamic. Continue to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes until basil has wilted. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl to cool, or proceed with your recipe of choice.Cook's note 1: Refrigerate up to 3 days or freeze up to 2 months.Cook's note 2: If making several batches of the recipe, decrease the olive oil by half and increase the cooking time to about 30 minutes for each additional portion. Example: If you multiply the recipe 3 times, use 9 lbs tomatoes, 3/4 cup oil and simmer the sauce for 1 hour and 40 minutes to 2 hours. All other ingredients in the recipe can be multiplied exactly 3 times. Last but not least, you'll need to increase the heat as it'll take more heat to keep a good simmer going with this much sauce."

How often should you bathe your baby?,2013-08-20,5 month old baby boy bathing and enjoying getting his hair washed,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d7092240000510053978e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Chaunie Brusie for GalTime.comWhen my husband and I first became parents, our daughter developed a flaky, yellow, scaly ""rash"" on her head. We rushed her to the pediatrician's office, anxious to restore our baby's perfect skin.The diagnosis?We were bathing her too often.In our quest to become the perfect parents, we had lovingly looked forward to her bath time each and every night, enjoying using her first little baby wash, anxiously fretting over the optimal bath temperature. She loved her bath and we loved the calming routine it provided to her at nighttime. Little did we know that our little bath time routine might actually be harmful to her.How often should you bathe your baby?Healthy Children, the official parenting site of the American Academy of Pediatrics, states that infants up to a year old may only need bathing three times a week. And as we found out the hard way, bathing babies more often than is necessary can dry out their skin.Is excessive bathing harmful?Generic baby soaps, even the hypoallergenic and gentle formulas, still contain moisture-stripping ingredients that can cause a baby's skin to dry out excessively, especially in the head and scalp area, and may lead to overactive oil glands that could contribute to ""cradle cap,"" that yellow, scaly rash that our daughter experienced.In our case, we also found that the baby wash that we were using tended to ""build up"" on our daughter's head, even with thorough rinsing, and made the cradle cap worse. The Mayo Clinic reports that the ""exact cause"" of cradle cap is not known, but is thought to be a result of hormones and/or a fungus or yeast that lives on the skin. The best prevention?Washing your baby's scalp every few days, instead of every day.Obviously, we didn't set out to bathe our baby everyday with the intention of drying out her delicate skin or giving her a raging case of cradle cap; instead, we were trying to bond with our baby and establish a calming bedtime routine. We knew that she enjoyed her nighttime bath and it set the tone for the evening to get her ""ready"" for bed. (Although ""bedtime"" is a loose term with a newborn, of course.)When we finally realized that daily nighttime bathing of our baby was not only unnecessary, but making her uncomfortable, we switched up our nighttime routine. Without a warm bath to calm her, we tried infant massage with some lavender baby lotion (the lavender is supposed to be calming) and stuck to swaddling and nursing her (well, obviously, I was the one nursing her) to cue her to sleep.In only a few days, with the reduced bathing, our daughter's cradle cap cleared up and we relaxed a little on our strict nightly bath time routine.Until that is, her next diaper blowout.
