And it can also be nerve-wracking! You're standing in front of two people who are having an out-of-body experience and you have to be their rock and emotional support throughout the ceremony. Over the years I've coached many a panicky uncle or grandmother, sister or brother, not to mention college drinking buddy, who is nervous because they don't know what they ""should"" do or ""should"" say when they officiate the wedding of a cherished friend or relative.Well, here's the thing -- five years after the ceremony no one will remember what you said, but they will remember the tone and feeling of the ceremony. When done well, a ceremony renews and refreshes people in an emotional way.So what does this mean for you as a guest wedding officiant? Well, it means you don't have to offer guests groundbreaking insights into the existential meaning of marriage! It simply means you have to: Be Prepared. Be Engaging. Be You.   You've probably been to enough weddings to know that they can easily turn into a boring, funeral-like affair. So, in this post I'd like to focus on how you can be an engaging officiant and hold people's attention during the ceremony.The tricky part about speaking in public is that all of what we communicate takes place simultaneously on two levels: content and tone. We often think that if our content (words) is solid, then the way in which we present it (tone) doesn't matter. However, a full 80 percent of what we pay attention to is the non-verbal, i.e. tone of voice, pacing, and facial and body expressions. Only 20 percent of what we pay attention to is actually the ""what"" of what is being said.So, while you can have a well-written ceremony laced with loving, inspiring words, if you don't deliver those sentiments with enthusiasm and conviction, then it all falls flat. Yes, what you say is important, very important, but if you don't ""deliver"" it so that people pay attention, it's all for nothing.6 Non-Verbal Tips for Being An Engaging Officiant:Eye Contact: When you make eye contact with people as you speak, you build a bond with them. Memorize your opening words and deliver them looking at the couple and their guests as this will make everyone feel you're talking ""to"" them and not ""at"" them. Smile: No one is judging you. The vast majority of people are relieved it's not them standing where you are! So, smile -- it's a wedding and not a funeral.Body Orientation: When the couple stands in front of you, make sure they're facing each other so the guests can see their profiles. If the microphone is on a stand, adjust it to the correct height so you're not leaning down and into it. With solid preparation, you won't have to be glued to your book and you can stand straight and look directly at the couple and their guests. Space: Oftentimes couples don't know how to stand or what to do in the ceremony, so make sure they're not standing far apart from each other. I usually suggest they hold hands. The three of you want to stand close enough to the front row of seats so that an intimacy is created. And if you are standing in front of an arch, make sure the flowers don't droop on you. I've had photos taken of me where it looks like I've got roses sprouting out of my head!Voice & Pacing: Be animated -- avoid speaking in monotone. Don't rush! Pause between thoughts to emphasize what you're saying. You're taking this group of people on an emotional journey, so have fun with it. There's no hurry. Pause for dramatic effect. Pause so guests can think about what you've just said. Attire: Ask the bride for her preference in terms of what you wear, i.e. suit and tie? Dress? Length? Color? I typically wear a black suit, white shirt and my tie compliments the groom and his groomsmen. You don't want your clothes to distract from the bride and groom. Although your ""title"" is officiant, what you really are is the ""host"" of the ceremony and as such, you are in charge. Prepare with generosity and focus. Bring to the ceremony the ""you"" whom your couple loves. And most especially, use the above tricks that will let people want to pay attention to you. Do all this and five years from now your couple and their guests will still be smiling when they think on the gift of your ceremony!JP Reynolds, M.Div. has officiated more than one thousand weddings and has coached hundreds of people in how to create and deliver heartfelt, personalized ceremonies.

We all have our weaknesses, and I suspect that the greed and insecurity that drive him are at least as painful, somewhere deep down, as many other forms of suffering. But that doesn't mean that he's ready to be president, either. Because with this kind of greed and self-absorption comes a weakened capacity to see the world around you. If you have $250 million and you're doing anything other than giving it away or thinking about how to give it away, then it's hard to see how you could have the compassion and concern for your fellow human beings that is the starting point of a decent presidency.This post originally appeared on my blog, The Wheat and Chaff."

In more traditional circles, the theme for a fifth wedding anniversary is wood. But since I'm celebrating the anniversary of my divorce -- my annivorceary, if you will -- I think a more appropriate theme for me is ""would,"" as in what I wish I would have known back in 2007.In honor of the occasion, I'm giving myself a present: a letter from me today to me five years ago. In the hope that this advice might help others who are at the beginning of a divorce, a copy of my letter follows: Hi, Christina 2007! It's me -- Christina 2012. Wow. That steady diet of stress, insomnia and crying isn't working for you at all. You look terrible -- except for the weight loss. I know you hate it when people comment on it, but take it from me: emaciated looks good on you. Wait! Don't start crying again! I know it probably seems insensitive of me to joke about this stuff. But that's the first bit of good news I have for you: I can joke around, because life is so much better in 2012 than it was in 2007. Things are going to improve with each passing day. It won't be a straight line, but the overall trajectory is definitely up. Six months from now you are going to feel so much better than you do today. And it will just keep getting better and better. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and you'll get there, I promise.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. The reason I'm writing is because I have a really valuable gift for you: Pearls! Not the kind that pretty you up; the kind that smarten you up. I'm going to tell you five things I know now -- in 2012 -- that I really wish you would have known at the beginning of the divorce process.So, listen up.1. You're doing the right thing. You know all that tossing and turning you do each night, wondering if you're doing the right thing by getting a divorce? Well, you can cross that off your list of things to worry about. And while you're at it, you can also quit fretting about whether all the sleep loss is giving you cancer. It's not. But it is giving you bags under your eyes -- and unlike the dramatic weight loss, those don't look so good. When it comes to your marriage, you did everything you could to try to make things work. Before long you will begin to appreciate that. You will get to the point where you won't even regret that you endured all that marriage counseling for nothing. You'll actually be grateful for that, because you'll have the peace of mind that comes from knowing you gave it your all. And you'll realize that if the marriage counseling had helped even a tiny bit, you, your kids, and your ex might still be trapped in that miserable marriage.   2. Your kids are going to be fine. I'm not going to sugar coat this: divorce is hell. It's hard on everyone, including your kids. But you are all going to come through this with flying colors. And not only are your kids going to be okay, they will be better than they were when they were subjected to that mess of a marriage. The key to helping them pull through this with the least amount of emotional trauma comes down to this: Trust your gut. You've got good instincts when it comes to your kids, so make sure to follow them. And don't forget to take care of yourself so you can be in a position to take good care of them, too.But there are a couple of messages you need to deliver to your kids. Make sure Aaron knows you're fine. He's worried about you and that's why he keeps checking on you all the time. Tell him you appreciate his concern, but at twenty-three years old he does not need to be your babysitter. Tell him you'll take a rain check on all that doting on you he's doing, and you'll cash in, with interest, in about forty years when you're in the dementia unit of the old folks home. He can come check on you as much as he wants then. And Hannah's worried about you, too. Even though she's not quite seven, she's always regarded you as capable and resourceful. But right now she's not so sure. Let her know that while you are sometimes sad about the divorce, you are still strong -- strong enough to take care of her. Strong enough to get through this. And strong enough to help shepherd her through this, too. 3. You and your ex won't hate each other forever.  I know it seems hard to imagine right now, but you're going to get to the point where the two of you aren't at war anymore. It's not like you're going to be BFFs or anything. But you don't need to be BFFs -- or even just plain friends -- to be effective co-parents. But it really helps to not hate each other. It's going to take a while, but I promise you'll get there.  In the meantime, here's a little trick I learned. Think of your ex as a Home Depot employee. After the Home Depot man helps you with something, you don't analyze every word he said. You don't obsess over the exchange. You don't let the encounter wreck your day. No. You thank him, go about your business, and don't give him another thought. Your ex is the Home Depot man. Treat him accordingly.   4. Your marriage counselor was right.  You know those last couple of sessions you had booked with your marriage counselor before you moved out? He's going to suggest that you use them as solo sessions to examine your role in your disaster marriage so you won't make the same mistakes in a future relationship. You're going to be really offended at that suggestion -- not because you object to his characterizing your marriage as a disaster. And not because you don't accept the fact that you played a role in it. Rather, you'll be offended at his insistence that you will end up in another relationship, because you have zero interest in ever dating again.   The thing is he's right. Eventually, you are going to date again -- and you're even going to get into a full-blown relationship. In fact, your future boyfriend (who is awesome, by the way) has asked me to tell you that he would really appreciate it if you sort through at least some of these issues before he comes along. He says you'll both lose a lot less sleep if you follow your counselor's advice. And that will help with those bags under your eyes -- but that's my advice, not his. He's way too awesome to say anything like that.  5. Let your lawyer do his job.  You chose your lawyer carefully. Now trust your decision and back off a little. He's going to make a mistake or two (or three -- but who's counting?) along the way. (Like accidentally mailing a letter for you to your ex's address. Not cool.) But remember, he's human and humans make mistakes -- including you. After all, if everyone were perfect you wouldn't be getting a divorce right now.One of your main frustrations with him is going to be this: You're going to feel like he treats your divorce like routine business, and you're going to wish he acted like he cared just a little more. Part of the problem is his minimalist communication style, and there is definitely room for improvement there. But the fact is your divorce is routine business for him -- and that's not a bad thing. You don't want your lawyer taking your divorce personally. Taking things personally clouds one's judgment. So, let your friends and family take your divorce personally, and let your lawyer do his job. Here's another thing to watch out for: You're going to think your lawyer isn't listening to you when you tell him (over and over and over again) that your main concern is your daughter, not the money. But he's not blowing you off. He knows that unless there's abuse or neglect, your ex is going to get your daughter first, third and fifth weekends just like everyone else. I know the thought of your daughter being gone that much sounds terrible right now, but the sooner you make your peace with it the better. The reason the standard schedule for non-custodial parents is so common is because it works pretty well. Your lawyer has seen what happens when people get so rattled about the kids that they take their eye off the ball when it comes to the property division. His job is to make sure the property division is fair so you will be in the best position possible to care for yourself and your daughter. By focusing on this aspect of the divorce, he is actually helping you and your kids in both the short and long run. There's so much more I could tell you, but my goal is to arm you with knowledge, not spoil any surprises. And boy, are there some fantastic surprises coming your way. So, keep your chin up and try to enjoy the weight loss while it lasts. When your fighting spirit returns, your fighting weight won't be far behind.   Happy Annivorceary! Rock your pearls of wisdom with impunity and I'll see you in five years!"

The staff over at Mom.Me found a way to fix a shrunken shirt that doesn’t involve giving it away or throwing it out.First, fill a sink with cool water. Then, pour 1/4 cup of hair conditioner into the sink, stirring the solution around. Next, lay the shirt in the water and allow it to lay flat for 15 minutes. Then, remove and soak it in clean, cool water for five minutes or until there is no more residual conditioner. Next, wring out the water and lay the shirt on a stack of towels. Then, Mom.Me blogger says to ""set one hand on the neckline of the shirt, and use the other hand to gently stretch the bottom hem down. Work from left to right, pulling the hem down an inch or two to resize the length of the shirt.” Next, pull the shirt’s edges in opposite directions to widen it. Finally, allow the shirt to air dry on a towel. Okay, this may sound a little complicated but it’s definitely better than losing your best shirt forever.

The storm has claimed at least 33 lives in the United States, and has caused massive flooding accross much of the Atlantic seaboard. US President Barack Obama has declared the situation a 'major disaster' for large areas of the US East Coast including New York City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c761d3c0000320009c50d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Superstorm Sandy has left buildings and boardwalks ravaged, subways and streets flooded and hundreds of thousands of people throughout the northeast evacuated from their homes due to flood dangers. But once the water has gone down and people are able to return to their homes, those who have experienced flooding in their residences should be aware of another potential health danger -- mold.Mold's ideal growth environment is a flooded home, since it's moist inside and there's ""organic"" material (such as ceiling tile or carpet padding made from natural fibers), which allows for the germination of mold spores, according to the New York State Department of Health. The EPA pointed out:During a flood cleanup, the indoor air quality in your home or office may appear to be the least of your problems. However, failure to remove contaminated materials and to reduce moisture and humidity can present serious long-term health risks. Standing water and wet materials are a breeding ground for microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and mold.According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, mold can begin to grow within 48 hours from when flooding first occurs.The health risks come from actually breathing in these mold spores, which can provoke negative symptoms in people, the Mayo Clinic reported. Breathing in mold can lead to symptoms including sinus infections and congestion, coughing and breathing problems, and irritation of the eyes or skin, the New York State Department of Health reported. And the Environmental Protection Agency reported that people who already have lung disease may also be in danger of developing mold infection in the lungs. The New York State Department of Health also reported that people who are immunocompromised -- like those undergoing chemotherapy treatments, or people with HIV/AIDS -- may also be particularly at risk for negative health effects from mold. Mold may also provoke asthma symptoms in people with the respiratory condition, according to a 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. ""We were able to find sufficient evidence that certain respiratory problems, including symptoms in asthmatics who are sensitive to mold, are associated with exposure to mold and damp conditions,"" Noreen Clark, dean of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor's School of Public Health, who was the chair of the committee that wrote the report, said in a statement.""Even though the available evidence does not link mold or other factors associated with building moisture to all the serious health problems that some attribute to them, excessive indoor dampness is a widespread problem that warrants action at the local, state, and national levels,"" Clark added in the statement. If you're looking for evidence of mold in your home, it usually manifests as a slimy or furry patch of growth that may also smell kind of musty, the New York State Department of Health reported. To remove the mold, first make sure to get rid of the source of moisture -- if there's still leaking or puddling, make sure to get the water out. Then, throw away the item that the mold is growing on (like the carpeting or ceiling tile), and make sure all things that are wet are dried completely. If the mold is growing on a hard surface, make sure to use gloves and a dust mask to scrub the mold away with a rag dipped in a detergent. However, for more severe mold cases, it may be necessary to call in a professional, the New York State Department of Health said. "

OK, maybe not really, but I do have a list of some pretty persuasive reasons if you'll indulge me. First, we're both brunettes. Any objections? I didn't think so. We both went with color. She wore pink for the big day, and I wore red. My groom entered our reception to ""SexyBack,"" hers wrote the song. And finally, her new husband is musically-inclined and so is mine. Where do we differ? There are the obvious fame and fitness disparities that I'm sure you're listing in your head right now. However, when it comes to saying ""I Do"" there is an additional, more striking contrast.My better half, the lead singer and songwriter of indie band Bad Lucy, didn't serenade me with his dreamy falsetto. On the other hand, Mrs. Timberlake's new groom recently revealed he sang as his bride walked down the aisle. In theory, it is the fairytale moment every bride might hope for. Even I, admittedly, wished and asked for a secret song in my honor at our reception. But the theoretical and the reality of your big event are two different things. And, in hindsight, I am thrilled and truly grateful my groom didn't take to the microphone. Convincing your fiancé to serenade you, whether he is a trained singer or not, might not be the best idea, and here's why:Emotional overload: Unless your groom has been performing day in and day out since he was on the Disney channel, the emotions of the ""I Dos"" might be too much. My groom didn't want to take on the added pressure of having to perform at his own wedding. ""I want to feel and embrace the emotion of each moment and let nothing get in the way of that,"" he told me. When I saw him, with tears welling up over his baby blues at the end of the aisle, I felt peace and joy knowing he had the freedom to feel without being distracted by the anticipation of performing. You and your groom should be carefree, focused on taking it all in. Despite all the pomp and circumstance we put into weddings, they are not meant to be performances. The most beautiful unions are those when both the bride and groom are at a raw and emotionally vulnerable place. It's expected: If your fiancé is a singer, people might expect a song. If he's a comedian, guests will assume he'll rattle off some jokes at the reception. Expected details, performances included, leave less of a 'wow' impression than true surprise moments. What if Justin read a poem dedicated to Jessica instead or what if she sang at the reception? Remember, garnering more buzz about your big day often requires you to stray away from the norm. No solos, this is a duet: There is no ""I"" in team, and the marriage you are about to embark on is about teamwork in every sense of the word. If a memorable performance is really important to you, I vote for bride and groom dances, songs or comedy duets. Doing something together is not only fun on the day of; it also brings you together during stressful planning moments. OK but really, it's about the bride: There is a little Bridezilla in each one of us, and this is a somewhat acceptable form of the condition. This is your day, and the last thing you want is a distraction when you are walking down the aisle or making your grand entrance. Cameras, both still and video, should be pointed in your direction, all eyes on you. Right? OK, maybe that is a bit vain, but you get the point.Lucky for me, I couldn't heavy hand my crooner groom into a wedding day performance. Instead, I have a lifetime of giggles courtesy of the video of our silly dance routine. Our number won't win any awards, but we did it together. And, with a little patience, I finally got my song. One year after we tied the knot, my best friend wrote the song ""Weather"" about our union. ""You and I, we go together no matter how high comes up the weather."""

In fact, I often tell students when it comes to style, nothing is an accident. Every detail is designed and intentional, so with that in mind, let's take an inside peek at the subliminal, subconscious -- yet intentional -- messages sent by the presidential candidates throughout the recent televised debates. Detail 1: The Psychology of ColorDid anyone else notice the fabulous red ""power"" tie Mitt Romney rocked during the first and last presidential debates? That tie was not incidental; it was intentional. I know what you're thinking... the color choice was a symbolic representation of the Republican party, right? Probably not, considering President Obama also wore a red tie twice during the 2008 debates. The point is, as the non-incumbent (a.k.a ""underdog""), in the first debate Romney had to prove himself a formidable opponent, one to be taken seriously by the voting public and the current administration. Romney had to come out swinging, and apparently he did. In fact, most analysts immediately dubbed Romney the clear winner in Round 1 of the three presidential debates. And, as both a political scientist and style expert, I can't help but think that red ""power"" tie certainly didn't hurt that winning image. On the other end of the color spectrum, in addition to red, blue ties are often worn by presidential candidates on either side -- and not just in honor of Old Glory. There is some serious color psychology going on under the surface of this seemingly ""patriotic"" color scheme. According to a survey conducted by three global marketing firms, blue is the most preferred color the world over. In addition, blue is associated with loyalty, trust and reliability. (Perhaps that's why we use the phrase ""true blue""?) Therefore, the U.S. President wears blue as a symbol of loyalty, not only to a specific voting demographic or political party, but as a symbol of his loyalty to the United States and the American public as a whole. So perhaps President Obama's shift to a burgundy tie in the final debate was a last-ditch effort to regain control and assert himself as Commander-in-Chief, often alluding to the knowledge and experience he acquired during the last four years in office. Red, as aforementioned, is considered a power color because red is associated with blood, and therefore the passion and vitality that flows from the heart, which leads me to my next point... Detail 2: Complexion, Complexion, Complexion Just as the color red denotes vitality, or the life-blood coursing through our veins, a rosy complexion is generally associated with good health. I'm not sure if it was the red tie, which clearly complemented Romney's hair and skin tone, or the makeup (I suspect it was a combination of both), but the Republican candidate's complexion looked especially ruddy and vibrant when he sported a red tie. Obama's complexion, on the other hand, tended toward ashy and sallow, and I can't help but think that a little pop of rosy color would have provided a stronger contrast to the dark suit, dark hair and dark skin to brighten him up a bit. It's fairly obvious the past four years have taken their toll on President Obama, though it seems premature greying and aging has become commonplace for any contemporary Commander-in-Chief. Take a look back at pictures from the 2008 debate, and you'll see the stark contrast in complexion I'm talking about.In fact, complexion is so important it was most likely one of the factors that threw the 1960 presidential election in John F. Kennedy's favor after the first ever televised presidential debate on September 26. Nixon, who had recently spent two weeks in the hospital and had lost 20 pounds, showed up in an ill-fitting suit and refused to wear makeup to improve his complexion or lighten his five o'clock shadow. Kennedy, on the other hand, had just spent the weeks prior to the debate campaigning in California and his complexion reflected a tan, well-rested candidate. Furthermore, Kennedy wore makeup which, no doubt, further improved his TV image. Whether or not the televised ""Great Debates"" threw the election in Kennedy's favor is irrelevant; what is important to note is the pervasiveness of style over substance. The majority of those listening to the debates on the radio deemed Nixon the winner, while the overwhelming majority who watched the debates on TV perceived Kennedy as the winner. Point being, more often than not, we ""listen"" with our eyes.Detail 3: Accessories Make the ManFinally, it's the little (or not so little) details that matter. Did anyone else notice Romney's supersized accessory in the final debate? Why was Romney's flag pin twice the size of the President's?! As a former bureaucrat, I have been an official recipient of one of those government-issued patriotic flags. (My pin actually had two flags, the Stars and Stripes alongside the Union Jack. It was a gift indicating my assignment to serve at the U.S. Embassy in London.) Having worked in Washington and overseas for the U.S. government, I've seen oodles of those mini patriotic pins, but never one the size of Romney's. Was it some campaign manager's or stylist's attempt to one-up the President on the accessory front? Perhaps there should be some sort of regulation or standardization of accessories in presidential debates similar to those that attempt to equalize the candidates' heights or balance out official ""floor"" time. Substance vs. StyleAs a diplomat turned designer, I know how important image is to outcomes. Hey, I wasn't appointed an official representative for the U.S. government at age 24 by being oblivious to details. As we head toward Election Day, I hope you'll heed the advice I give my students. Both substance and style are important, but the nonverbal often affects us at the subconscious level. So be sure you can separate the substance from the style, and you're on your way to becoming a savvy media consumer and prudent political participant."

People should also be aware of the possibility of smoke, escaping gas or damage to the structure of the building (which would make it unsafe to walk in). If it is OK to enter the building, the Department of Health warns people to use a flashlight to look around -- NOT an open flame -- since there may be gas in the building. It's also important to turn off the outside gas lines and have them checked, not to mention the water and electrical lines. People should also wear proper attire -- gloves, and rubber boots with heavy soles -- if walking around inside a damaged building. The Department of Health also advises people to keep photographic record of all damage done to the property, as well as costs necessary to repair the damage, and to not discard anything before inventory is taken.

This one comes from an Inuit custom between fathers and sons.In central Alaska, there is a river that begins on the northwest slopes of the Alaska Range and flows more than 650 miles to the Bering Sea. The shores of the river are mostly thick with trees and uninhabited. These chilling waters are known as the Kuskokwim River.John Larson, a Dateline NBC correspondent, was in Alaska covering a news story when he learned of an Inuit custom in which elders take their sons once a year to the mouth of the Kuskokwim River. Here the largest salmon return from the Bering Sea. The elders teach their sons that if you watch closely enough, you'll see the biggest fish barely break surface, leaving an almost imperceptible wake. When the big fish break surface in this way, the Inuit say they are making eyebrows in the water. The slight break of surface is known as the wake of an unseen teacher.When father and son alike see this wake, the harvest begins. This is a powerful metaphor for how we fish for what matters in our lives. We are always looking for the teachers that swim just below the surface, like the face of God skimming below the surface of our days.The Inuit believe that, wherever the large salmon break surface, they leave traces of everything they've carried from the mountains to the sea and back. If a son can swim to the spot and drink, he will have the strength of salmon wisdom growing in his belly.This Inuit ritual is another indigenous instruction for the great care and attention needed to see through to the essential realm of spirit that underlies everything. Though even when sighting what matters briefly, there is no guarantee that the deeper reality will surface in the same place twice. Still, it is the art of sighting the wake of an unseen teacher that begins the harvest. This way of listening below the surface of things opens a kind of education that is not really teachable, though we can bring each other to its threshold through love.Excerpt from Seven Thousand Ways to Listen, just published from Simon & Schuster Oct. 9, 2012.

As early as Monday morning, Sandy was causing the seaside promenade to be broken into pieces that could be seen floating in the swelling waters. Even before the storm made landfall, a 50-foot section of the boardwalk was wiped out by strong waves, NBC reports. Atlantic City's boardwalk opened in 1870, making it the first boardwalk in the U.S. Its original purpose was merely to keep sand out of the city's ritzy hotels and train cars, and no commerce was to be allowed within 30 feet of the walk, according to Atlantic City online. This ordinance was scrapped 10 years later and shops on the walk boomed. The City and the boardwalk declined in prominence in the 1960s, as USA Today points out, but was revitalized by the introduction of casinos in 1978. From salt water taffy, to Miss America, to the Trump Taj Mahal, the Atlantic City boardwalk is one of the East Coast's great icons and sources of nostalgia. Take a look back, and add your own favorite photos. Ed. Note: To clarify, the entirety of the Atlantic City boardwalk is not gone, though a portion of it was taken out by the storm. However, the section of the boardwalk that was destroyed was in mostly residential areas, rather than the iconic tourist stretch, and it was already slated to be demolished and rebuilt, says the Press of Atlantic City."
