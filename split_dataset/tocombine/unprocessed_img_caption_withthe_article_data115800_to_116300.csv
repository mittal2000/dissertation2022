After an early penalty surrendered by the Selecao produced another deficit, an unlikely goalscorer soon doubled the Dutch advantage: Daley Blind. While Blind is far better sighted than his surname suggests, the 24-year-old midfielder had never previously scored an international goal for the Netherlands. His career milestone score pushed the Netherlands' lead to 2-0 in the 16th minute.

Yet, the Republicans, and their pitiable leader John Boehner sink to new levels of absurdity by the day. On Thursday, Boehner announced that Republicans intend to sue the President for changes to his signature health insurance law, known as ""Obamacare.""Speaker Boehner has been talking about his plans to sue the President for over a month. He should proceed with caution. The American people are sick and tired of being sick and tired at this ""do-nothing"" Congress. House leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) lost his party's primary to a political unknown because he was out of touch with voters in his conservative leaning district in the suburbs of Richmond Virginia. This should be a warning bell for many House Republicans. The House Rules Committee recently has fallen into line with this sue-the-President scheme by making public a copy of the draft legislation outlining Republican complaints. But where does it stop? Instead of working for the American people as they were elected to do, they are wasting time, money and energy on this kind of nonsense.The real issue at hand is a simple one: Republicans in Congress simply are not willing to work with President Obama. The President time and time again has extended an olive branch to Speaker Boehner in efforts to build cooperation. Republican lawmakers say it's Obamacare that bedevils Congressional cooperation. But wounds run deeper than that. Republicans have been trying to repeal the law for years, claiming it will ruin the country financially and that Americans would refuse to enroll in its coverage. The cynics and critics were wrong. Millions of Americans signed up for Obamacare and the country has moved on with business as usual.No, this latest fiasco is not about the Affordable Care Act. It is about Midterm elections. Yes, it is about politics, and the reality that Republicans have little progress to report to their constituents. They have little that they accomplished on behalf of the Republican base. They should have thought of that last year while they put their energies blocking any idea the President had to move the country forward instead of doing the business of the people they were elected to serve. Republican are so desperate they are even speaking of impeaching President Obama. They had better hope they keep their own jobs come November. Meanwhile the president is not sitting on his hands waiting for Speaker Boehner to come to his senses. I have to commend President Obama for using his executive powers to move the country forward! That's exactly what he was elected to do. Bravo!"

Reynolds American Inc.'s third-quarter profit grew nearly 7 percent as higher prices and smokeless tobacco gains helped offset a decline in the number of cigarettes it sold. The nation's second-biggest tobacco company on Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2012 reported net income of $420 million, or 74 cents per share, for the three-month period ended September 30. That's up from $394 million, or 67 cents per share, a year ago. Adjusted earnings were 79 cents per share, matching beating analysts' expectations.(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb310a01f0000df0023bf10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Martinne Geller and Kate HoltonLONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc is in talks to acquire rival Lorillard Inc in a multi-billion dollar deal that would reshape one of the world's biggest and most profitable tobacco markets, the companies said on Friday.A deal would also involve the sale of some brands to Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group to address potential antitrust concerns, as well as the purchase of more shares in Reynolds by British American Tobacco (BATS), its largest shareholder.In a statement confirming what people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters, Reynolds, No.2 player in the United States with brands including Camel and Pall Mall, said the talks were consistent with its strategy of weighing options that would help boost shareholder value.Buying Lorillard, which had a stock market value of $22.9 billion on Thursday, would give Reynolds the leading U.S. menthol cigarette Newport and its leading e-cigarette blu.Analysts say the combination could also generate $500 million in annual cost savings, helping the No.2 and No.3 U.S. players compete with Marlboro maker and No.1 Altria Group Inc in a market where sales volume is falling about 4 percent a year as more Americans quit smoking.Despite the decline, the U.S. remains the biggest tobacco market in the world after China and the most profitable.""Reynolds is getting both a fantastic brand in Newport and strong intellectual property in the e-cig category,"" said analyst Philip Gorham at research firm Morningstar. ""It's a good deal strategically, we just need to know what they're paying. If they pay a premium to today's price, it's going to be on the rich end of historical deals.""Historically, he said tobacco deals have fetched an average enterprise value (equity plus debt) of about 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which is about where Lorillard's stock was trading on Friday, up 4.8 percent in New York.SUPPORTING THE DEALBAT, which owns 42 percent of Reynolds, said that if the deal proceeds, it would expect to support it by buying more shares in Reynolds with the aim of maintaining its current stake, which is the company's only exposure to the U.S. market.Over the last 50 years, the United States has seen several waves of lawsuits against tobacco firms, including complaints by individuals, class action suits and a massive racketeering case. Cases have concerned the industry's negligence, disclosure of health risks and advertising practices.Litigation risks contributed to the 2008 separation of Altria and Philip Morris International, which is now the world No.1 selling Marlboros everywhere except the United States. But analysts say the litigation risk has waned, so there is now more openness to trade there.""A lot of the more extreme class action suits haven't really made the progress people thought they might,"" said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo, who questioned whether by buying into the United States, Imperial would be taking on additional risk.""I'd have thought that given Imperial's leverage in the negotiations, they will be able to insist that they don't,"" he said.Imperial, known for its Gauloises and Davidoff cigarettes, said it was in talks with Reynolds and Lorillard about buying certain assets they might sell but saw no guarantee the proposed deal would come off.A source familiar with the situation said Imperial was lining up about $7 billion to finance the potential purchase of brands such as Kool and Salem, which would ease antitrust concerns thrown up by a Reynolds-Lorillard combination.Reynolds, Lorillard and BAT said there were no assurances a deal will be reached. They added that unless circumstances dictate otherwise, they did not intend to comment further.Imperial shares closed up 3 percent at 2,740 pence, while BAT shares ended up 0.2 percent.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb768573c000032000d8ab6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is and isn't about LeBron James returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is about a man growing up and breaking free. To understand the magnitude of LeBron's decision, we need to examine the Decision. Through the free agency period of 2010, LeBron James embraced the attention and fell in love with the spectacle. Ultimately, in a 75-minute TV special, James announced he was leaving Cleveland to sign with fellow All-Stars and 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami.And the world erupted, betrayed. LeBron was supposed to lead his Cavaliers into clash after clash versus Wade's Heat, a la Magic Johnson and Larry Bird or even Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant. Past legends announced their disapproval, blustering how they would never have joined their rivals. But we forget the paradox of LeBron James: the last high school-to-NBA prodigy, and the first Twitter-era superstar. No one before had to face a 24/7 spotlight. No one was signed by Nike to a seven-year, $93 million shoe deal before playing a minute of collegiate or pro basketball. No one was the heir apparent to Jordan despite playing like Magic. We blame him for going AWOL, but the fact remains that no one asked LeBron who he wanted to be. Somehow, we remain astonished that LeBron tried to make people happy, believing that the role carved out for him was his destiny.He had to leave, to grow up and realize that he is one of the best players ever, with a unique combination of astonishing speed, strength, vision and fire, all piloted by a chess player's mind. He is a battering ram on ice skates, a gale-force wind with the feet of a dancer. The problem was, to the eternal delight of any fan with the bravado of anonymity, he forgot that. He allowed the shrieking to drown out the fact that all he had to do, all he ever had to do, was win. He slipped, reaching his nadir in the 2011 loss to the Dallas Mavericks just when the haters were howling like monkeys, rattling the bars and foaming at the mouth. And that's when LeBron hit mute on the world. Before, the joy he displayed was a weapon, to be held gingerly and with reverence. He loved being Cleveland's treasured son, and so he played the part. He joked too much and won too little. Now, rings in hand and demons exorcised, there is a different joy -- a joy in purpose. LeBron James plays with the quiet self-assurance of a man who treats his craft as sanctuary, not theater. He will still unleash rim-rattling dunks, hurl passes that bend the laws of geometry, but these are expressions of an artist where before they were outbursts of an actor. He no longer plays for the lights; he plays for the game. He suits up not to lift us, but to fly.He finally understands he is singular, and he is special.And that's why I never really believed it would be as easy as people assumed for the Miami Heat to retain the services of LeBron James. He let others dictate his 2010 free agency. Dwyane Wade tipped off Heat president Pat Riley that James could be pried away on promises and bling. His friend and business partner Maverick Carter told him to use the Decision to raise money for charity.Pat Riley promised him he would be Magic. He wouldn't have to score nor carry the team. But LeBron mastered himself. He sat down at season's end and remembered leading Miami in scoring all four years. He remembered playing the most minutes on his team every year -- a lead that only increased annually. He remembered believing Heat owner Micky Arison would spare no expense, and then bidding farewell to key contributor Mike Miller for purely monetary purposes. He remembered the promises, both fulfilled and broken.Pat Riley delivered an unhinged press conference this offseason in which he challenged his stars to stay in Miami, if they ""had the guts"". He preached loyalty and patience -- two virtues he talked LeBron out of practicing in leaving Cleveland. I wondered if Riley saw a team that would collapse without LeBron James. 2010 LeBron James would have been grateful to Riley, enough to overlook the fact that he was never Magic, overlook the financial reality of two expensive and insufficient co-stars, overlook how this Heat team was embarrassed in the Finals. He would overlook the broken promises. But that boy was gone.In LeBron James's thoughtful, honest and elegant essay, he shows a degree of personal growth matching the maturation in his game. He was a kid four years ago who needed a place to grow, needed to realize he owed nothing to anyone, and that there were many fans who felt privileged to watch him.He says he knows Cleveland probably won't win a championship, and that's okay. He says that what he left behind in Ohio was bigger than basketball, although he needed to leave to realize it. The one word I most associate with LeBron James now is a word I never thought I would tag him with: serenity.This summer, LeBron once again sat amidst promises and optimism, and felt threads of possibility run through his fingers. He remembered the ones fulfilled, remembered the ones broken.He knows now that for every moment of harmonic resonance a championship roster exhibits, there will be catastrophic missteps. He knows no vision for him will come exactly as promised. For every 2013, a season which his Heat reeled off a 27-game winning streak en route to defending their title, there will be a 2014, a season in which his team staggered through the regular season before getting run over.And so LeBron opted for something he was far too young to understand four years ago. He chose to give himself to something bigger than the game.Because no matter how far we wander astray, we can always go home."

We should at least give them a fair chance to make their case.",2014-07-12,"American Flag at Half-mast at USA-Canada Border Crossing, Niagara Falls, New York, USA",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf83200000f90101d0b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Children have been all over the news, and for the wrong reasons. Three missing Israeli teens were found dead in the occupied West Bank, sparking the reprisal killing of a Palestinian boy who was burned alive. Reports of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children arriving into the U.S. from Central America have dominated the media as politicians and the public grapple with how we as a nation should respond.I did not make the connection between the two sets of tragedies until I read a short piece entitled ""The New Way of War: Killing the Kids."" The notion that children are increasingly not only collateral casualties but also targets of war was amongst the findings in the annual report, ""Children and Armed Conflict,"" recently released by the United Nation. Examples provided in the U.N. report include the kidnapping of schoolchildren in Nigeria, children being used as human shields in Syria, and the killing and maiming of youth in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Central American countries from where most of the recent unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. began their arduous journeys -- El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- are not in the U.N. report. But there is ample evidence to support that many of them are in a similar situation of targeted violence. First, mainstream media and human rights organizations report that children from these countries are on the front lines of gang violence. Gangs are in schools and on the streets, targeting boys for recruitment and girls for ""sexualized killings."" A Washington Post article quoted a young boy interviewed by the Women's Refugee Commission: ""In El Salvador, there is a wrong -- it is being young... It is better to be old.""Then there are interviews from the children themselves:After interviewing more than 400 children who successfully fled their home countries, the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] found that almost 60 percent of children had legitimate claims to seek asylum in the United States. Most were escaping recruiting attempts by violent gangs who forced participation or threatened the entire families of children who refused. Which is why the U.N. is advocating that these Central American children arriving into the U.S. be treated as refugees. Even the Department of Homeland Security acknowledges that they are ""com[ing] from extremely violent regions where they probably perceive the risk of traveling alone to the U.S. preferable to remaining at home."" Yet, some politicians seem to be simplifying the dire reasons for these minors' migration, attributing it to a rumor that they would receive permission to stay and blaming their parents for bringing them here unlawfully (some are coming to unite with their parents, which is a related but also separate issue concerning our broken immigration system, but more than 60 percent do not have a parent in the U.S.). The government's response to these children has been considerably more punitive than humanitarian, by focusing on detaining and quickly processing the young arrivals -- the latter is not necessarily punitive, until you put it in the context of White House advisor Cecilia Muñoz's remarks doubting that most can make a case to stay, and that children as young as ten years old have had to appear in court without a lawyer. I have been representing indigent immigrants for the better part of my career, and so have witnessed many wrenching situations that are almost impossible to solve. This is not one of them. We know that children are increasingly the targets of wars across the world. Some of them are coming from neighboring countries into the U.S. to seek refuge. They are youth who can integrate into and contribute to our society. We should at least give them a fair chance to make their case."

(AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13a18240000500024e9c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Richard Balmforth and Natalia ZinetsKIEV, July 12 (Reuters) - Ukrainian war planes bombarded separatists along a broad front on Saturday, inflicting huge losses, Kiev said, after President Petro Poroshenko said ""scores and hundreds"" would be made to pay for a deadly missile attack on Ukrainian forces.In exchanges marking a sharp escalation in the three-month conflict, jets struck at the ""epicenter"" of the battle against the rebels close to the border with Russia, a military spokesman said.The planes targeted positions from where separatists using high-powered Grad missiles bombarded an army motorized brigade on Friday, killing 23 servicemen.Warplanes also struck at targets near Donetsk, the east's main town where rebels have dug in, destroying a powerful fighter base near Dzerzhinsk, Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the ""anti-terrorist operation"" said.""According to preliminary assessment, Ukrainian pilots ... killed about 500 (rebel) fighters and damaged two armored transporters,"" Lysenko told journalists.In an earlier air attack on a base near Perevalsk, north of Donetsk, two tanks, 10 armored vehicles and ""about 500"" rebel fighters were destroyed, he said.Rebel representatives, quoted by Russian news agencies, denied they had suffered big losses and said the Ukrainians were using outdated intelligence about where separatist forces were deployed.""There were no volunteers (rebels) where the Ukrainian aviation was active yesterday,"" said a spokeswoman for the Luhansk-based separatists, referring to the Peravalsk attack.Earlier, the border guard service said jet fighters were scrambled to strike at the pro-Russian separatists after they resumed missile attacks on government forces deployed near the frontier with Russia, south-east of the city of Luhansk.In the military action, which began on Friday evening and continued well into Saturday, five Ukrainian servicemen were killed, Lysenko said. There had been 16 overflights by Ukrainian fighter jets in all, he said.Rebels had also carried out mortar and missile bombardment of army checkpoints at Dyakove and Nyzhnoderevechka near Luhansk, the ""anti-terrorist operation"" said.Journalists based in Donetsk said Ukrainian forces appeared to have shelled Maryinka, a suburb, on Friday night. Ten multi-story apartment blocks bore traces of fire and parts of shells could be seen in the street.Poroshenko, whose forces had recently seemed to be prevailing over the rebels, had vowed on Friday he would ""find and destroy"" the rebels responsible for the missile attack at Zelenopillya, which also wounded nearly 100 and was one of the deadliest yet against government forces. NEW SENSE OF URGENCYThe increasing violence will bring a new sense of urgency to diplomatic attempts to end the worst crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War.After a pro-Western revolt in Kiev ousted a Moscow-backed president in February, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and pro-Russian separatists seized strategic buildings in towns in the Russian-speaking east, setting up ""people's republics"" and declaring they wanted to join Russia.More than 200 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed since then, and hundreds of civilians and rebels have also died.The United States and the European Union have brought in limited sanctions against Russian businesses amid Ukrainian allegations that Moscow has fanned the conflict and turned a blind eye to military equipment and Russian fighters crossing the border.On Saturday, the EU targeted 11 Ukrainian separatist leaders with travel bans and asset freezes, avoiding fresh sanctions on Russian business to avoid antagonizing its main energy supplier.The rebels' missile strike on Friday at a motorized brigade was against a part of a contingent of troops sent to the area specifically to try to block military equipment and guns being brought in from Russia to help the rebels.""The situation on the border is very difficult because there is a strip of border there which has been turned into the epicenter of confrontation,"" Lysenko said.""This is because this is a part of the border through which the Russian terrorists are trying to bring in military equipment and arms.""Ukrainian forces are there to cover that part. If the Ukrainian unit pulls out of there then columns of military equipment will start to flow on to Ukrainian territory again,"" he said.Rebel fighters said Ukrainian fighter planes had also carried out air strikes on Saturday in the eastern town of Horlivka. ""There were a series of powerful explosions. Details are being clarified,"" a separatist representative, Konstantin Knyrik, was quoted as saying by Russia's interfax news agency. EYES ON CONTACT GROUPFriday's military setback at Zelenopillya took the gloss off the government's recapture of the rebel stronghold of Slaviansk last weekend.The Ukrainian military, following the Slaviansk victory, says it has readied a plan to oust the rebels now from Donetsk, a city of 900,000 people where separatist forces are dug in.Poroshenko has said the military plan will be aimed at protecting civilians there and had appeared to rule out the use of air strikes and artillery to crush the rebels.Poroshenko, who was also urged by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to use a sense of proportion in actions against the separatists, had further talks on Friday with Donetsk mayor Aleksander Lukyanchenko on the issue.Western allies and Russia are pressing for a new meeting of the 'contact group' involving separatist leaders to try to negotiate an end to the crisis.Poroshenko says he has proposed various venues for these talks to take place but has said there will be no repeat of a 10-day unilateral ceasefire by government forces which lapsed on June 30.The Ukrainian government says that ceasefire was repeatedly violated by the rebels and that more than 20 Ukrainian servicemen were killed while it was in force.(Additional reporting by Maria Tsvetkova, editing by John Stonestreet)"

In the past year, Greenwood was busy working with orchestras, Thom Yorke spent his time on Atoms for Peace, Philip Selway began his solo album and Colin Greenwood focused mostly on charity work.As NME points out, Greenwood hinted at this timeline in April, teasing that the band would regroup this summer. He confirmed plans for a ninth studio album were in the works and told Nashville Cream, ""But, you know, we're a slow-moving animal, always have been. I guess we'll decide then what we do next.""The band's last album ""The King of Limbs"" was self-released in 2011 and debuted at number 6 on the U.S. Billboard 200, but was the first Radiohead album since 1995's ""The Bends"" to not reach number one in the U.K.  "

When she joined Vice President Walter Mondale's presidential ticket in 1984, Geraldine Ferraro didn't just make history, she changed the political world for women -- for women as candidates and as participants in our democracy. During the campaign she said, ""This candidacy is not just a symbol, it's a breakthrough. It's not just a statement, it's a bond between women all over America."" And she was right, having women run for office isn't about symbolism -- it's about having a truly representative democracy. Everyone needs to have a voice at the table. That's what we work toward at EMILY's List. EMILY's List got its start in 1985, building on the momentum for women that Geraldine helped kick start. The women we see in the House and Senate today owe a great deal to Geraldine -- she showed voters that women could compete and be tough under pressure while still being likable. Her candidacy gave credibility to women in all walks of life. Her running mate Mondale said ""I thought that putting a woman on a major-party ticket would change American expectations, permanently and for the better."" And he was right. Thanks to Geraldine's willingness to blaze the trail, so much has changed in the past few decades. So much progress has been made for women. We now have countless women serving in public office who are qualified and ready to be on the presidential ticket in 2016, 2020, 2024 and beyond. We've had women chairing House and Senate Committees, serving as Speaker of the House, as cabinet secretaries, as Supreme Court justices. But only one other woman has been on a major party's presidential ticket, and no woman has been elected president or vice president since Ferraro's campaign began. We still have progress to make. As much as things have changed for women, too many things have stayed the same. Women still earn less than men for the same job. Women earn just 77 cents on the dollar. That gap grows even larger for African-American women who earn just 65 cents, and Latina women who earn just 54. Gender discrimination in pay doesn't just affect women -- it affects every American family and our country's economy as a whole. Too many women are working for a minimum wage that they can't live on. Women are a full two-thirds of minimum wage earners, and many of those women are working hard to support their families, but can't make ends meet no matter how many hours they put in. Americans across the country are starting to see what happens when we elect women to office. The historic number of women in the Senate ended the government shutdown and helped construct and pass a budget, a transportation bill and a farm bill. Women in Congress pushed through the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and forced our nation to have long-overdue discussions about sexual assault in our military and on our college campuses. The Democratic women in the House and Senate are working to make sure every family has a fair shot at getting ahead, not just getting by. That's the kind of leadership that Americans are looking for. Our government is slowly starting to look more like our country -- and we're seeing just how great that can be. But, women still make up less than 20 percent of Congress, despite being 51 percent of the population. We need to elect more women at every level of office. And it's time that representation reached our nation's highest office.In 2016, we have the chance to change all of that. And the women whose names you're hearing in the 2016 mix are already leading our nation and fighting for a fair shot for all Americans. Hillary Clinton has made a career out of championing the middle class -- working for women and families at home and abroad, and bolstering American jobs as a First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State. Women like Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar have fought for better policies for families -- things like financial and consumer safety, fair pay policies and better healthcare options. It's been 30 years since Geraldine made history. And it's been 30 years of women making history since. Now, it's time for a woman to break that last glass ceiling and bring a strong voice for women and families to the White House. It's long past time -- there must be a Democratic woman on the ticket in 2016."

""I don't like two people of the same sex making public displays of affection. It's a question of respect. And I'm convinced that it's also morally harmful for children.""La Repubblica reports that the mayor is proposing a new ordinance that would ban PDA between gay couples, who could be fined up to 500 euros for sharing a kiss on the streets of Borgosesia.As Pink News notes, Buonanno -- who also told La Repubblica that he intends on putting up a photograph of virulently anti-gay Russian President Vladimir Putin in his office -- has a ""reputation for inane stunts.""Earlier this year, for instance, he was expelled from Parliament for pulling a sea bass from under his bench and waving it around.

The story of apes and humans trying to coexist in the ruins of our modern society includes not just action and spectacle, but pauses and breaths.It all works because director Matt Reeves structured his film like a prestige drama. (In an interview with HuffPost Entertainment, he explained one of the touchstones for the project was ""The Godfather."") ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" focuses not on good guys and bad guys, but three-dimensional characters. That colors the film's antagonists -- Gary Oldman's Dreyfus, a leader of a human colony left alive following a devastating simian flu that wiped out most of the population, and Toby Kebbell's Koba, an ape previously tortured by human beings while in captivity -- in shades of grey recognizable to those who watch television shows such as ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad.""""The thing is a lot of blockbuster movies have villains who become almost cartoonish. They're not really nuanced,"" co-writer Amanda Silver told HuffPost Entertainment. ""Matt, particularly, wanted even the bad guys to have a rationale. They're not truly bad guys, because they think they're doing the right thing. That's just an interesting concept. It makes for a much more complicated and thoughtful movie.""""It's kind of villains in quotes,"" Rick Jaffa, Silver's husband and co-writer on ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" said. ""I think audiences really appreciate when you try that. It takes things to a higher level.""Jaffa and Silver, who also wrote ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" contributed a first draft of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" before writer Mark Bomback and Reeves rewrote the script to center the film's plot more squarely on Caesar (Andy Serkis), the ape revolutionary from the first film. Bomback and Reeves also made sure to keep Oldman's Dreyfus on a recognizable plane.""Matt and Mark, especially with the humans, worked very hard at [keeping the villains empathetic],"" Silver said.One scene in particular that sets ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" apart from films of its ilk happens just before a climatic battle, when Dreyfus scrolls through old photos of his deceased young sons on a recently powered-up iPad. He breaks down crying at the sight of their cherubic faces.""That is one of my favorite scenes,"" Silver said. ""We had that in our original script too, and that's the kind of scene that when people are getting stressed out about the length of the movie, it usually gets cut.""""It's really a tribute to Matt that he thought to leave such moments in,"" added Jaffa. ""I can tell you as a screenwriter that the unspoken rule is that if you're going to have a scene like that in a movie, you're always going to attach it to information that's vital. Otherwise, it'll never make it.""""That moment is pure character,"" said Silver. ""That's rare, and very noble. Very exciting.""Also exciting for the husband and wife duo is their work on James Cameron's ""Avatar"" sequel. ""We can't really get into the 'Avatar' discussion, but we can say that working with Jim has been a thrill,"" Jaffa said. ""It was a great honor to be brought on, and we've loved it. We love him. We're on a journey, and it's a lot of fun. It's really cool."""

By the time that divisive contest was over, Brazil probably would have preferred if the Netherlands hadn't played either. The Netherlands claimed third place at the 2014 World Cup with a 3-0 victory over Brazil at Nacional in Brasilia on Saturday. The Dutch, who were runners-up in 2010, jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the first half and added a third goal in second-half stoppage time. Ranked No. 15 in the FIFA rankings released before the start of the World Cup, the Netherlands notched victories over Spain, Australia, Chile, Mexico and Costa Rica before losing to Argentina in a penalty shootout in the semifinals. Despite Van Gaal's public criticism of the third-place match, his team ended its trip to Brazil on a high note with a decisive win over the hosts. ""Today's match I think for us was the best way to end this tournament,"" Netherlands forward Arjen Robben said after the win, via The Telegraph. ""We also fully deserved this third place the way we played. Nobody expected us to be in the last four.""With Brazil playing without injured star Neymar and reeling from a 7-1 thrashing in the semifinals by Germany, the Netherlands took control of the third-place match early, scoring two goals in the first 16 minutes. Striker Robin Van Persie converted a penalty kick for the opening score after Brazil defender Thiago Silva took pulled down Robben. The lead was doubled in the 16th minute when a ball headed by Brazil defender fell for the Netherlands' Daley Blind in the penalty area. Brazil managed to reach halftime without surrendering any more goals but could not hold the Netherlands scoreless the rest of the way. In the first minute of second-half stoppage time, midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum added the final goal for the Dutch. ""It's a terrible feeling, I don't know what to say,"" Brazil's Oscar said after the defeat, via The Associated Press. ""After a huge loss to Germany, today we tried our best from the beginning to win third place but it wasn't our day. We have to see what went wrong so we can improve for the future."""

Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel (1969) ""They are not like us. We sanctify life, they sanctify death."" Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel (2014)""Though it may be of little solace, we must take comfort in the moral government, culture, and society we have created."" Yehoshua Oz, Israel Democracy Institute (2014)More galling than Israel's brutal behavior toward the Palestinians is their determined effort to cloak their actions with claims of morality. There is, of course, nothing new in this. Throughout history, more powerful nations have always sought to portray themselves as more noble and their conquests as serving an elevated purpose. As the Great Powers of Europe wreaked havoc on their weaker neighbors or on Asians, Africans and Latin Americans, they masked their own barbarism, at least in their own minds, as being dictated by a civilizational imperative. Tens of millions of dead Irish, Poles, Jews, Algerians, Africans, South Asians, Vietnamese and countless others bear witness to the contrary. As Americans, we inherited this mantle -- and we have worn it well. We celebrated what could only be described as genocidal campaigns against our continent's native peoples, as victories against savagery. And we portrayed our brutal Westward advance as progress and a fulfillment of our God-given destiny. Our utterly inexcusable use of nuclear weapons and refusal to inform the Japanese of the effects of radiation ultimately took the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocents. Despite this, we called the bombing ""lifesaving"" and heralded the role it played in ending the war. Much the same could be said of our use of napalm and carpet bombing in Vietnam and, more recently, our decade-long sanctions against Iraq, followed by our invasion and occupation. We called it ""bringing freedom,"" but to the millions of dead, maimed, tortured and homeless Iraqis other descriptions come to mind. Israel is no stranger to this game.  From the beginning, its founders saw themselves as the bearers of Western civilization. In ""The Jewish State"", Theodor Herzl described his ambition to create a colony that would be ""a rampart of Europe against Asia... an outpost of civilization against barbarism."" His colleague, Max Nordau, envisioned the Zionist enterprise as extending ""the moral boundaries of Europe to the Euphrates."" And Ze'ev Jabotinsky wrote ""we will always be on the side of the West, for the West has represented a more superior culture than the East... and today we are the most prominent and loyal bearers of that culture."" The earliest European Zionist settlers in Palestine, then, saw themselves as colonizers bringing progress and civilization to a desolate land populated by a backward people. They even referred to the indigenous Arabs as ""Red Indians"" -- mere obstacles, with no rights, to be removed in order to pave the way for a far nobler enterprise. Their mythic construct was captured in popular culture in Leon Uris' book and movie Exodus, in which Israelis are portrayed as a moral people seeking only freedom and a future, forced against their will to confront a ""savage culture"" that only wanted to kill them.This powerful myth took hold in Israeli culture and has held fast for almost a century. Despite the ""ethnic cleansing"" campaigns of 1948, the documented massacres, the effort to obliterate Palestinian villages and history, the occupations and the attendant killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese, the forced expulsions of thousands, the use of torture and prolonged detention without trial or charges and the daily humiliation and degradation of an entire captive people -- many, though not all, Israelis still see themselves as the moral nation in the Middle East. The stark contradiction between how they see themselves and the reality of what they were doing, has led the Israeli leadership to develop a rather bizarre form of denial. They cannot acknowledge that they do evil, and, therefore, they deny it or present themselves as victims of the duplicity of their enemies. When sleeping children or men watching a World Cup match are killed by ""not-so-smart"" bombs falling on Gaza, then Hamas is to blame -- because they must have ordered them to be there. When reporters take pictures of destroyed homes and wrecked lives, Israel's propagandists insist that these photos have been recycled or staged. Given this mindset, Israel will admit no wrong. What they are saying and what they insist that we must also believe is that ""Israel doesn't kill innocents. If they are dead, it is either because they were guilty or it was someone else's fault. And if you continue to insist that it is our responsibility, then it must be that you are under the influence of our enemies."" Of course, the propaganda of the powerful and their self-delusion has limits. It may still control the way the Gaza story plays out in U.S. mainstream media, but for much of the world's media and for independent bloggers here in the US, reality has broken through. This can also be seen in the witness of Israeli human rights groups and journalists who have long been sharp critics of their government's immoral behavior. As I write, the horror of Gaza continues. This is the fifth major assault in nine years. When and how it will end is unclear, but here's what we know for certain: No good will come from this madness; there will be no winners; the Palestinian people will pay the dearest price; and when the dust settles and the tears dry, Palestinians and Israelis will be more embittered and will feel less secure, with both waiting for the next round. In spite of this, Netanyahu and his ilk will continue to claim that they are the moral nation, all the while attempting to bully into submission anyone who dares to disagree. They will do so with renewed vigor, because myth and denial and, when that fails, intimidation are the means the powerful use to enforce their claim to morality."

How many different people have you been that you would barely recognize?At 29, I've definitely been more than one person. There was Teenage Jess, who lived in a small town in Texas and wanted more than anything to get out of Dodge and go to an Ivy League school. There was Shy College Jess, who finally made it to Brown University, but spent most of the time too timid to come out of her shell and did not date a single guy in four years.  But then, as time went by and I found my footing, there was Sassy Jess, two years out of college, who lived and worked in Beijing as a magazine editor. To be honest, I miss Sassy Jess -- I could really use her feistiness sometimes. Eventually, Sassy Jess gave way to Brazen Jess, who packed up everything and moved to Australia because she was taking a chance on a big love. And now, at nearly 30, I wonder if I've finally become Stable Jess, living and working London for the past two years; going to dinner parties and plays -- Stable Jess, but also Brazen and Sassy and Shy and Teenage Jess, all at once.I struggle to remember exactly what I felt at the moments when I went from one version of my life to another. It does feel like some of my major life events happened to another. What, for example, did I feel when I met an exciting Brazilian during the Summer Olympics in China? Or how did I react when a dashing Englishman broke my heart on a snowy winter day five years ago? What was I thinking when, as a TV reporter, I snuck into an teenage boot camp for a story? When I went skydiving in Australia (something I would never dare do now), was I shaking from fear or excitement -- or both?Forgetting can be a beautiful thing, but sometimes we live too much in the present. We forget about all the girls and women we have been. I recently read through years' worth of correspondence with my best friend for a book we were writing together and realized there were entire crushes that I had forgotten even existed. There were whimsical hopes that I am now saddened to realize have fallen entirely by the wayside. There was the real-time giddiness of discovering the world and growing up, remembering of how it felt to jump into the ocean in Australia for the first time or cycle along a quiet Beijing alleyway at 3 a.m. -- it was all there. More than anything, the letters let me relive those dizzying moments of falling in love. I've concluded that, just like cats, we may get as many as nine lives... if we're lucky. Jessica and Rachel's book, GRADUATES IN WONDERLAND, is an epistolary memoir about their postcollege adventures living in New York, Beijing, Paris and Melbourne. Jennifer Weiner named it one of her Top Ten Beach Reads of this summer. It's out now."

Washington's risky game of political brinkmanship neared crisis point Tuesday, with no deal yet nailed down to avoid a catastrophic US debt default, just 36 hours before a crucial deadline. Despite global fears that the US government could run out of money to pay its bills on Thursday, the rift cleaving US politics and a fight for the soul of the Republican Party thwarted compromise. Hopes a nascent deal between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate would open the way to resolve a fight over raising the US borrowing limit and reopening government proved over optimistic.

As the NH Journal first reported Thursday, Ayotte will preside over the nuptials of Scott Brown's 23-year-old daughter, Arianna, and her 23-year-old fiancée, who once served as an intern in Brown’s Senate office. Brown is running for the Republican nomination in the hopes of unseating Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). The wedding will take place at a winery in Lee, N.H. “I consider it a great honor to have been invited to perform this ceremony, which will join the lives of two special young people -- Arianna and Jim. I'm looking forward to celebrating on Sunday,” Ayotte said in a statement.An Ayotte spokesman said the wedding will be the first she has ever officiated. The senator endorsed Brown in May, though the two have differed on policy matters. A WMUR/University of New Hampshire poll released Tuesday shows Shaheen with a 12-point lead over Brown in a hypothetical head-to-head match-up. Though Brown's summer will undoubtedly be filled with campaign events, he'll also be kept busy with family: his older daughter Ayla, who was a semi-finalist on the fifth season of “American Idol,” is getting married in Nashville, Tenn. in August.

(AP) -- Twice last year, Alix Tichelman found herself alone with a man suffering from a drug overdose. The first time she called 911. The second time, police say, she just walked away.Tichelman, 26, faces manslaughter charges in California after police say the alleged high-priced prostitute calmly collected her things and left as Google executive Forrest Hayes lay dying on his yacht in November following a heroin overdose. About two months earlier in Georgia, she made a panicked call to 911 as her boyfriend Dean Riopelle, owner of a popular Atlanta music venue, suffered an overdose in their home.Tichelman was never charged in Riopelle's death, but police said Thursday they're going to re-examine that case.""Both subjects in these cases died of heroin overdoses so there's just several factors we want to look at to make sure that we didn't miss anything,"" Milton police Capt. Shawn McCarty said.Police in California say Tichelman had many clients in the wealthy Silicon Valley, but it wasn't clear how long she may have been involved in prostitution. Police there also said that, after Hayes' death, she had done online searches for how to defend herself legally after administering a lethal dose of heroin.No one answered the door Thursday at the two-story home in the upscale Folsom, California, neighborhood listed as the address for Tichelman's father. The front door was damaged, with a broken door handle and scuff marks on the wood.A message taped to the door and dated July 8 read, ""Please no visitors or media or other contact with the residents, respect our privacy and our property.""Neighbor Brad Parks, who lives three doors down, said the family moved in a year or two ago. He said he didn't know much about the parents and had seen Alix Tichelman just two or three times, most recently about two weeks ago.Numerous social media postings, photos and other articles online suggest Tichelman was pursuing a career as a fetish model and a life with Riopelle — one photo posted on her Facebook page shows her displaying a diamond ""promise ring"" given to her by Riopelle.Riopelle and Tichelman had been dating for about two and a half years and lived together, said Riopelle's sister, Dee Riopelle.In a 2012 interview with a fetish magazine, fIXE, under the pseudonym AK Kennedy, Tichelman describes herself as a model, writer and makeup artist.She also said she was interested in bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism, or BDSM. She said she and Riopelle would go to clubs, with her wearing a collar and leash.Photos that accompany her interview show her in sexually suggestive poses wearing a variety of skimpy outfits, including a studded leather jacket with thigh-high fishnet stockings.Riopelle was the lead singer of a rock 'n' roll band called the Impotent Sea Snakes, known for its wild stage shows and sexually explicit lyrics. Online videos show the band performing at a massive music festival in Germany, with members dressed in drag. Riopelle, under the stage name ""13,"" is wearing a long, pink wig, a leopard-print jacket, platform boots and tight pants.Back in Georgia, Riopelle also was known for owning the Masquerade, an Atlanta music venue that is a popular destination for rock, punk and metal acts. Housed in a former mill, the venue is composed of three levels: ""heaven"" upstairs; ""purgatory"" on the main floor; and ""hell"" downstairs. He was also known for his love of monkeys, as evidenced by his well-kept property in Milton. Just to the right of Riopelle's home stand large animal enclosures, which include a barrel strung up by rope and fencing extending to the top.Riopelle went to the University of Florida and got a degree in construction engineering. But when he was told by a boss to cut his hair and wear a bigger tie, he decided engineering wasn't for him, his sister said. He opened his first bar, also called the Masquerade, in the historic Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa, Florida, his sister said. About 25 years ago, he moved to Atlanta and opened the Masquerade there.Over the years, he also opened several sports bars and a fetish bar, his sister said.""He was very, very wise when it came to business sense,"" Dee Riopelle said. ""Everything Dean touched turned to gold.""In September, however, he and Tichelman's lives took a dark turn. On Sept. 6, a drunken Tichelman called police, saying Riopelle threw her to the ground, according to a police report. Riopelle told officers that she had taken pills and drank alcohol, and had been stage diving and exposing her breasts that night at the Masquerade. He said he took her home because he did not approve.Riopelle also told officers that she bit him on the finger and threatened to hit herself and tell police Riopelle had beaten her. A neighbor confirmed hearing Tichelman say that. She was charged with battery and arrested; Riopelle was not.Less than two weeks later, a panicked Tichelman called 911, saying her boyfriend had overdosed on something and wouldn't respond. She told a dispatcher that his eyes were open but that he was unconscious, describing his breathing as ""on and off."" In the 911 tapes released Thursday, she can be heard saying, ""Hello, Dean? Dean, are you awake?""Tichelman tried for five minutes to revive him before calling 911, according to a police report. She said she had been in the shower when she heard a crash and came out to find Riopelle unconscious. Tichelman said she did not know how much drugs Riopelle had taken, but that he had been on a ""bender the last few days,"" according to the police report.Riopelle died at a hospital a week later. An autopsy report listed his death as an accidental overdose of heroin, oxycodone and alcohol. Tichelman had told the dispatcher that he had been taking painkillers and drinking.Police say surveillance video from the Google executive's yacht shows Tichelman's next deadly encounter with heroin in California, on Nov. 23.Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark gives the following account from the video:Tichelman prepares the heroin to a liquid and injects it into Hayes' arm. Shortly after, Hayes clutches his chest, near his heart. Tichelman tries to prop him up, but he then loses consciousness.Tichelman then starts picking up her belongings, including the needle, and cleans up a counter while stepping over Hayes several times. During that time, Tichelman calmly drinks a glass of wine and surveys the scene.Tichelman then goes outside the cabin of the boat on the dock, looks back inside, then pulls down a window blind, closes a door and leaves.""Never does she call 911 or call out to others in nearby boats for help. She never tries to administer any aid to him,"" Clark said. ""She is more concerned about getting herself out and concealing evidence than helping Mr. Hayes.""Clark said that investigators learned that Tichelman later did online searches ""on how to defend herself after giving a lethal dose of heroin.""Investigators also learned Tichelman planned to leave California late last month, possibly for Georgia, and maybe even leave the country, Clark said.———Collins reported from San Francisco.

""It's a good deal strategically, we just need to know what they're paying.""At banking group Wells Fargo, analyst Bonnie Herzog estimated Reynolds would pay a premium of about 20 percent to Lorillard's latest closing price of $63.09 per share, which would value the company at $27.2 billion.Cigarette sales volumes are declining in many mature markets due to rising health consciousness and weak economies. Yet their high price places them among the most profitable consumer goods. And electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are growing rapidly despite the threat of increased regulation.SUPPORTING THE DEALBritish American Tobacco Plc (BAT), which owns 42 percent of Reynolds, said that if such a deal proceeds, it would expect to support it by buying additional shares in Reynolds with the aim of maintaining its current stake.Reynolds, Lorillard and BAT all said there were no assurances that a deal will be reached. They added that unless circumstances dictate otherwise, they did not intend to comment further.Imperial, known for its Gauloises and Davidoff cigarettes, said it was in talks with Reynolds and Lorillard about buying certain assets they might sell but also saw no guarantee the proposed deal would come off.A source familiar with the situation said Imperial was lining up about $7 billion to finance the potential purchase of brands such as Kool and Salem, which would ease antitrust concerns thrown up by a Reynolds-Lorillard combination.""This transaction in our view will be very positive for the global tobacco industry and could be just the beginning of future transactions with (e-cigarettes/vapor products) being the underlying catalyst,"" said Wells Fargo's Herzog.Imperial shares were up 2.9 percent at 2737 pence at 1258 GMT, while BAT shares were up 0.5 percent.

Despite those obstacles, the three men, who are worth a combined $184.3 billion according to Bloomberg, urged Republicans to listen to reason.""A Congress that does nothing about these problems is extending an irrational policy by default; that is, if lawmakers don’t act to change it, it stays the way it is, irrational,"" they added. ""The current stalemate -- in which greater pride is attached to thwarting the opposition than to advancing the nation’s interests -- is depressing to most Americans and virtually all of its business managers.

That may be the case, but they both need to put aside those differences and act soon. Violence has erupted again between Palestinians and Israelis threatening to reach a new and dangerous crescendo, and there is a growing urgency next door to the Palestinian Authority and Israel, with forces threatening the Hashemite Kingdom north and east of Jordan. Over the past year cracks never before seen have appeared, challenging the integrity of King Abdullah's country. A year ago it was written in the Jerusalem Post: It is only a matter of time before the bloody and messy civil war in Syria puts further pressure on the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and then easily spills over into the Palestinian territories and Israel. An oasis of relative calm and stability remains in Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Israel. We must assure those entities are not swallowed up by the tumult of their neighborhood. A key ingredient for that cohesion to hold is an agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. Despite the best efforts of Secretary of State Kerry and his team this past year the Israelis and the Palestinians did not reach an agreement. They no longer have the luxury of such time. Time will soon tell, if it has not already by the recent escalation of events between the Palestinians and the Israelis, that the ""relative"" calm oasis of the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and Jordan will be swallowed up by destructive elements on the move.The Middle East may be entering the beginning of Islam's own version of the Thirty Years War which devastated Europe 500 years ago. If radical elements from Syria and Iraq are able to take over Jordan, or even parts of Jordan, Israel would be exposed all along her long and vulnerable eastern front. For Israel to have that peaceful border on her east remain intact she needs to strengthen Jordan and to strengthen Jordan a viable Palestinian State needs to be established. Such a change would take internal and external pressures off the Hashemite Government and increase her stability. The establishment of a viable Palestinian State would also transform a number of regional dynamics. Diplomatic relations would be established between Israel and many other countries creating a new cohesion in the area. Second, Palestinians would have a state they would not want to lose. That is to say, they would be highly motivated not to do anything that could invite Israel to reconquer their territory. The Palestinian government and people would have very strong incentives not to allow radical elements to take over a Palestinian State. Mechanisms for economic, environmental, and security cooperation between the three states would need to be created, as well as opportunities for people to people engagements as already modeled by the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies and other grassroots NGOs. Investment in tangible deliverables for the citizens of all three countries would also be essential to create further buy-in by the Jordanian, Palestinian, and Israeli populations. Having laid out the scenario of what would happen following the establishment of a Palestinian State does not mean everything would so nicely fall into place. However, the status quo between the Palestinians, Israelis, and Jordanians is already being challenged by radical Islamic elements and something has to be done now to counter that force. While the majority of Palestinians are not so radical, the longer a viable Palestinian State is not created radical elements will find the right conditions to grow within a frustrated Palestinian populous, particularly as that power takes on a greater role in the region. The horrific murder of the Israelis teens did not happen in a vacuum. Prime Minister Netahyahu and President Abbas may wish they had someone else to negotiate with across the table. That is a luxury neither can afford anymore, otherwise events outside of their control will dictate in very unpleasant ways their future. It is time for both of them to dig deep and make the hard and difficult decisions to create a viable Palestinian State along with a secure Israel with both fully engaged with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan."
