Cut to poignant parenting moment.Earlier in the day, during a painfully unsuccessful attempt to teach my 15-month-old to color with crayons, something unexpected happened. Unprompted, she picked up the ripped, drool-soaked piece of yellow construction paper and lifted it up to veil her eyes.She was instigating Peek-a-Boo. She was doing her first comedy bit -- and by the grin on her face, she thought she was killing it.""Well, look at that,"" I said to her. ""You're a regular George Carlin."" Truth be told, I personally never found George Carlin that funny. But, let's be honest: on a scale of 1 to Fey, Peek-a-Boo registers at a negative Leno. Even so, I played along with her routine until the violent Hulk-style arching of her back against the high chair's harness suggested she'd had enough. ""And... scene!""

""Clearly, mental processing and learning skills are key to the excellent performance of the professional athletes. However, it is unclear whether this superior learning ability is unique to professional athletes, and moreover whether these are innate skills that led them to be selected by these teams, or whether these skills have been acquired through extensive training,"" study researcher Jocelyn Faubert, of the University of Montreal School of Optometry, said in a statement. ""It will therefore be interesting to see how individuals of all athletic abilities improve their perception score as they train with this system.""The study included 102 professional athletes from the English Premier League (soccer), the National Hockey League, and France's Top 14 (club rugby), as well as 173 elite amateur athletes. Thirty-three non-athlete college students were also included in the study. The researchers had all the study participants undergo a task called ""3D-MOT"" 15 times. (It should be noted that the study researcher is the CEO of a company that produces 3D-MOT commercially.) LiveScience explained how exactly the task worked:The task, based on a test known as the 3D-MOT procedure, works like this: A number of colored spheres are shown floating in 3D space. Four of the spheres flash a different color briefly, then blend back in with the other spheres for a period of eight seconds. The viewer must keep track of the four that changed color, and identify them after the spheres stop moving. If the viewer makes errors, the spheres slow down; if he or she is accurate, the spheres speed up.Researchers found that the elite athletes did better on the test than the university students.""Although the context had nothing to do with any specific sport, we found that professional athletes were able to process the visual scenes much better than amateur athletes who were in turn better than the students,"" Faubert said in the statement.

Not coincidentally, a popular image, one that's often depicted through illustrations, reveals an energized and powerful silhouette in the night's light of an animal seemingly wailing at a celestial being that will never answer its calls.But, interestingly, as we think this through a bit more, we realize that the wolf is not howling at the moon but at his pack mates. This is their time for communication, when the earth rests still and their voices carry best. With that in mind, as we ponder this image and consider this time in the cycle of our own lives, in the deep heart center of the winter season, we can easily appreciate how much force it would take to move us from our slumber. Indeed, we need the howling wolf to hear the message... and, what might that be?Considering recent events, I think the answer is apparent. As a culture, we must deal with the use of guns and reevaluate the question of civil liberties and rights associated with our laws concerning them. As difficult and contentious a subject as this might be, the wolf howling in our backyard tonight is imploring us to respond and take this on, consider it with the full attention that it deserves and not to fall back into our trenches. No, the time has come to take action and make some adjustments in order to save our pack.All of that being said, there's still no simple answer. And I am not going to suggest one here. But, like the members of the pack of wolves, they listen to each other. They couldn't survive otherwise. And for us too, this is a good time to remember the value of listening and hear what is being said. In order to move forward, we need to respect each other and stay together.A friend of mine recently told me a story of the impact it had on her life when, as a child, her friend was hit by a car and badly injured. The friend remained in critical condition for weeks after the accident, and it was unclear whether she would survive. It affected her so much so that it actually resulted in a change of behavior. Identifying a new type of fragileness for life, and in an attempt to avoid the notion of having to say goodbye to her friend or to anyone else she cared deeply about, she actually stopped using the word ""goodbye"" for some time. Although subtle, her mother picked up on this, and kept a reciprocal distance from the phrase out of respect for her daughter, until her friend recovered and they both adapted it again. It wasn't until years later that they discussed it, but she never forgot how taking her slight behavioral shift as a cue, rather than just simply a new habit or circumstance, kept her mother more attune to the message she was expressing.Now, take this story and relate it back to nature. In this case, my friend's howling was heard, as subtle as it was. And her mother kept this secret safe until it was ready to be released.Now, take this occurrence in nature and relate it inward. Think of the wolf as a metaphor for a person, and the pack as a metaphor for their community. Many a howl we've let out, calling for hope, support, change or danger, and many have discounted it, regarding it as business as usual. But like the wolf, we have allies who may not be in plain sight, or better yet, we may be one of those hidden allies. In this, we can see that as a group, we are greater than the sum of our parts. And while wolves utilizes their sharp skills of cooperation, working together to achieve their goals of survival, we too can work in cooperation -- regardless of our individual beliefs -- to achieve our goals as well.For more by Dr. Michael Finkelstein, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."

For me, a fashion show is about curating the vision I've been researching for months into a tangible production that everyone can get something out of. The best part of designing any collection is seeing it come together when that first look hits the runway.For fall 2013, I thought a lot about the defense mechanisms people project to the world and began to explore the ways in which these mindsets are empowering. This got me thinking about the world of nature and the methods of defense inherent in certain animals and insects like beetles, scorpions and dart frogs. We translated the concept of natural protection metaphorically in a balance of light and dark, and literally in pieces like the trapunto-stitched jackets resembling the padded armor of trilobites.Color was huge for me, which is specific to this collection but I wouldn't say it's a departure from who I am -- it's just about looking at nature in a different way. When you hear ""nature"" you think about muted, earthy tones, which isn't always the case. The vivid colors and prints exist in nature, but look synthetic since you're not around them every day, which was an interesting dichotomy to explore.Casting models was tricky since we were after such a specific look. Definitely strong girls that looked beautiful naturally and carried themselves with confidence, but there was also a focus on specific features like eyes spaced farther apart and rounder faces. Ethereal but hard around the edges: a look that would render the collection as a kind of shield. Hair and makeup grounded the concept in reality. I don't want to give too much away, but think ""protected.""I'm most excited about the debut of my first jewelry collection with Shapeways 3D Printing marketplace. Not only does it translate the idea of exoskeletons into armor you can actually wear, but its innovation lies in its immediacy. Today is all about the ""nowness"" of fashion; everyone wants something at the click of a button the first time they see it. Now they don't have to wait four months until next season; they can order straight from the runway. This is the future of fashion, and it begins with Kimberly Ovitz fall 2013."

Now I have heard about 200 drunken impersonations of Bon Qui Qui over the years, but seeing the real BQQ staged as a worker in Wang's Soho store was freaking genius. Not only does she piss off Brazilian Victoria's Secret Angel Alessandra Ambrosio, she also offends Simon Doonan, creative director at Barneys New York, by calling him a ""toddler in a wallpaper shirt"" and imposes her own music talent on A$AP Rocky. Freaking genius.This video epitomizes why Alexander Wang is SO freaking cool. And why I am overly excited for his debut in Paris at Balenciaga this upcoming month. Nicolas Ghesquière, who used to hold the Balenciaga helm position, is also breathtakingly cool, but in a different way. Alexander Wang had Courtney Love perform in a gas station kegger at one of his after-parties. He is overwhelmingly right on the pulse of awesome new vibes and the best people and references from the past. While Nicolas Ghesquière was always painstakingly chic and on the mark with his collections, Alexander Wang has a sense of humor and irony that only a crazy American can create.Another reason I am overly excited about Alexander Wang at Balenciaga is that his clothes are incredibly wearable. Wang's first couple of collections for his self-titled line were the best in basics; tees, denim, dresses, jackets and sweatshirts. What a girl really wears, day in and day out. Balenciaga hasn't seen that kind of accessiblity in years. Also, Wang's own collection is very well-priced. And his T by Alexander Wang line is, in my book, down right affordable. I hope to the lords of fashion that the powers that be at Balenciaga take a note from Wang's own success at a lower price point. It would be incredible if Balenciaga did a few items each seson at an affordable price point.Go Alex! I will be cheering you on from NYC! Super stoked to see what this incredible young fashion talent brings to the table for his Paris debut!Watch my Fashion Rant on Look TV for more background on Balenciaga, Nicolas Ghesquière and Alexander Wang:"

The river runs away from the base of the towering Andes through the small Argentine town of Potrerillos near the city of Mendoza. The experience of sliding down this river is so scenic it comes as little surprise it has also become so popular.Mendoza is malbec central and, as such, tends to attract a sophisticated crowd of adventurous oenophiles. The Mendoza River makes a great break from the wine tasting and provides a way to burn off some of the calories from all the grilled meat hawked in town.The rapids along the stretch of the Mendoza frequented by rafting tour operators run from level three to four on the International Scale of River Difficulty; think of it as geometry rather than calculus. The only complicating factor is that the river itself, having so recently cascaded from altitude, is quite cold. Wetsuits are encouraged, and all-weather gear is an absolute necessity.For those willing to raft a little further than others, the Potrerillos Reservoir, a lake formed by the massive dam blocking the river, is a lovely place to relax in the sun. The weather is temperate and the breezes are invariably cool. This is wine country after all. On shore there are hiking trails that travelers can follow to scenic overlooks, but all that time spent walking would be better spent, realistically, with a glass of malbec in hand."

This morning, over a breakfast of green tea and fresh fruit (she is a vegan, I am on a diet), avoiding too much football talk, we chatted instead about what she is planning to wear during her time in New Orleans.Hilary is no stranger to exclusive sporting events, having spent time in London last year for the Olympics.

It is one of the only occasions (outside of the Olympics) that brings people together from all industries, including sports, music, film and more."" As such, outfits during Super Bowl-related events have to be both comfortable and fashionable. Here is a rundown of what she plans on wearing:Friday, February 1, for the plane ride from Baltimore to New Orleans: ""I'll be wearing cuffed jeans, flats (heels in airports can be treacherous), a purple sweater and a purple scarf."" She then enlightened me as to the tradition of Purple Fridays in Baltimore. ""Every Friday in Baltimore is Purple Friday.""

Saturday, February 2, Brunch with her BFF For brunch with her bestie Carrie, another huge Ravens fan whose birthday it is on Saturday, she'll wear skinny jeans and flats, ""so that we can walk around the French Quarter after brunch."" A white collared button-down shirt and the same purple scarf as the one she will wear Friday will complete the outfit, while still representing her team colors. In case it rains, ""I'll bring my light camel-colored J. Crew trench coat.""Sunday February 3, Super Bowl For the last two games (against Denver and New England), Hilary has worn the exact same outfit. While she is somewhat superstitious, she admits: ""I just don't think I can wear it to this game, it's way too casual."" Indeed, the day the Ravens played Denver, Hilary decided to wear her Ray Lewis t-shirt that says ""Welcome to Baltimore"" to her yoga class before watching the game. Home after yoga, still in that shirt, she slipped on a pair of Under Armour workout pants and a black double-breasted comfy sweatshirt, and happily cheered. Come the following Sunday, the same outfit made its appearance for the New England game, with a similar effect. After giving much thought and consideration to her outfit for Super Bowl Sunday, she has decided on the following: a purple shirt and a white Zara blazer with black skinny jeans, and a pair of heels. Comfortable and chic, ""this will be my outfit for the NFL tailgate which will flow into the game."" Any fashion no-nos, I ask? ""Anything red..."" No surprise there."

A generous dollop of that wealth courses through Singapore on February 10, 2013, when the Chinese usher in the Year of the Snake, and little red ang pow or hong bao envelopes stuffed with bills exchange hands all over the city-state.But budget travelers fear not. In a country where a brand new 2012 Toyota Camry costs $146,000, and million-dollar Ferraris and Lamborghinis are driven on the roads -- not just parked in driveways -- daily, there are plenty of alternatives that won't send your checking account into cardiac arrest.Photos by Sanjay Surana unless noted."

First, go to the store and buy a chicken. Next, remove its wings. Next, truss its little feet together. Now paint it brown. What does it look like? Exactly: a football. Chickens are footballs, except for the wings. And that's why when we watch football, we eat chicken wings.Slideshow: Best Chicken Wings in the U.S.Some people might question the logic of the above theory, but they, of course, have not been drinking enough beer. Because that is the other thing that goes perfectly with chicken wings: beer, and enough of it.Of course, it's perfectly simple to order up a bunch of standard-issue buffalo wings, open a Bud and have a fine ol' time watching big people with a ball smash each other silly. But given that I work at a place where we seem to be testing a new wing recipe every single day--everything from classic buffalo wings to Vietnamese-fish-sauce-soaked wings (which, contrary to how they sound, taste great)--the one-note approach seems a little like a cop-out. Given the vast world of wings out there, here are a few more off-the-wall beer-pairing thoughts:Classic Buffalo Wings Classic lager beer: Brooklyn LagerReally, Really Hot Wings Crisp pilsner beer: Trumer PilsAsian-Influenced Wings Belgian tripel ale: Westmalle TripelSweet, Sticky, BBQ-ish Wings Lightly bitter English pale ale: Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale AleFruit-Glazed Wings Fruit-infused beer: Harpoon UFO Raspberry HefeweizenMore from Food & Wine: More of America's Best Chicken Wings Delicious Chicken Wing Recipes Best Burgers in the U.S. Best Pizza Places in the U.S. America's Best Bars Ultimate Super Bowl Recipes"
