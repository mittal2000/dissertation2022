""Residents provided information that the aircraft crashed into Tangok mountain.""There was no immediate word on whether anyone survived.Earlier, the National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) said a twin-turboprop plane had lost contact with air traffic control as it flew over the forested area of eastern Indonesia but efforts to trace it were difficult because of failing light.Trigana Air Operations Director Beni Sumaryanto said that within 30 minutes of hearing that the aircraft was missing, the airline sent another plane to scour the same flight path but it had found nothing because of bad weather, local media reported.According to the official BASARNAS Twitter account, the aircraft, a short-haul ATR 42-300 airliner belonging to Trigana Air Service and built in France and Italy, was carrying 44 adult passengers, five crew and five children and infants.The plane was flying between Jayapura's Sentani Airport and Oksibil, due south of Jayapura, the capital of Papua province.Air transport is commonly used in Papua, Indonesia's easternmost province, where land travel is often impossible.According to the Aviation Safety Network, an online database, the ATR 42-300 that went missing made its first flight 27 years ago. ATR is a joint venture between Airbus and Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Italian aerospace firm Finmeccanica.The airline has been on the EU's list of banned carriers since 2007. Airlines on the list are barred from operating in European airspace due to either concerns about safety standards or the regulatory environment in their country of registration.The airline has a fleet of 14 aircraft, according to the airfleets.com database. These include 10 ATR aircraft and four Boeing 737 Classics. These have an average age of 26.6 years, according to the database.Trigana has had 14 serious incidents since it began operations in 1991, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Excluding this latest incident, it has written off 10 aircraft.Airline officials were not immediately available to respond to enquiries from Reuters.Indonesia has a patchy aviation safety record and has seen two major plane crashes in the past year, including an AirAsia flight that went down in the Java Sea, killing all on board.The AirAsia crash prompted the Indonesian government to introduce regulations aimed at improving safety.Indonesia's president promised a review of the aging air force fleet in July after a military transport plane crashed in the north of the country, killing more than 100 people.

3,RELIGION,Exhibit Explores Indiana Jones's Quest For Religious Relics,"Sara Weissman, Religion News Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indiana-joness-religious-relics_us_55cba863e4b0f1cbf1e73fcf,Sacred artifacts make religion “physical in a way that’s hard to ignore.”,2015-08-16,"<p><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: OpenSansRegular, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.4440002441406px; line-height: 18.4979991912842px; background-color: #f5f5f5;"">The Holy Grail from “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” is on exhibit at the National Geographic Museum in Washington, D.C.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55cbac9f170000b70056758e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (RNS) The exhibit “Indiana Jones and the Adventure of Archaeology,” at the National Geographic Museum until Jan. 3, features 100 carefully crafted film props alongside real archaeological finds.There’s the golden Ark of the Covenant from “Raiders of the Lost Ark” — the model for the container that housed the Ten Commandments, complete with two winged cherubs as described in the Old Testament.There’s the cup representing the Holy Grail from “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”And there are the oblong, translucent Sankara stones from “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” an imagined artifact based on symbols of the god Shiva.What is it about Indiana Jones and, more broadly, the quest for religious relics that captures people’s imaginations?Exhibit curator Fredrik Hiebert said his archaeology students loved the movies when he used to teach at the University of Pennsylvania. So when George Lucas, creator of the film franchise, reached out to National Geographic about an exhibit, Hiebert “took 20 seconds to say yes” to the proposal.“I like the fact that George Lucas can entertain, make you laugh and make you think deeply about God, the afterlife and the past at the same time,” said Heibert.And that’s precisely the appeal of Indiana Jones, according to Peter Manseau, who holds a doctorate in religion from Georgetown University.“It’s not simply archaeology but the archaeology of the sacred, the idea that once upon a time humans had this immediate capacity to connect with something sacred,” said Manseau, who writes about Jones’ connection to sacred objects in an upcoming issue of the magazine CrossCurrents.Sacred artifacts also excite people because they lend legitimacy to religious stories, Manseau noted. As much as religion is a matter of faith, he said, these archaeological adventures are at some level quests for proof because sacred artifacts make religion “physical in a way that’s hard to ignore.”In his own work, Manseau has often gone to see relics, particularly remains of saints, in the process of writing his book “Rag and Bone.” He recalled the impact of seeing the finger of John the Baptist in Florence, Italy, presented artfully in a glass and gold case.“It was clearly a human finger, a real human life, and that gives stories associated with it all the more power,” he said. “These objects have been the receptacles of devotion for centuries and that also gives them their own significance.”The Indiana Jones films themselves, meanwhile, authenticate religious stories in a way that’s unusual for Hollywood, Manseau said. For example, in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” when the Ark of the Covenant is opened, rays of fire strike Jones’ rivals, confirming the ark’s supernatural powers.But the films also critique certain religious ideas, Manseau said. In “The Last Crusade,” Jones finds that the Holy Grail is a simple unadorned cup from which Jesus may have drunk during the Last Supper or perhaps the Crucifixion, as opposed to a bejeweled gold goblet. This is arguably an understated endorsement of a simpler, non-ostentatious Christianity.Today, Manseau sees a connection between Jones’ archaeology of the sacred and his own profession as a religion writer.People’s overwhelming curiosity about quests for religious artifacts may not be unlike the search for religion stories. “You’re digging into people’s lives,” he said. “You’re digging into their experiences, looking for the most sacred moments to them.”Meanwhile, the real-life quest for religious artifacts is ongoing. National Geographic is currently studying the oldest temple in the world, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, Hiebert said.“It gives me goosebumps,” he said. “I’m thinking this could be the next location for an Indiana Jones film.”Also on HuffPost:"
4,POLITICS,Huckabee Backs Denying Abortion To 10-Year-Old Raped By Stepfather,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huckabee-abortion-10-year-old-rape-incest-victim_us_55d0a275e4b07addcb433a4a,"""Does it solve a problem by taking the life of an innocent child?""",2015-08-16,"<span class=""big""><strong>MYTH:</strong></span> Abortion is dangerous.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d355f41700006e00567c56.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee supports Paraguay's decision to deny an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim, he revealed in an interview Sunday.In an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" the former Arkansas governor argued that the Paraguayan government's refusal to allow an abortion for the now-11-year-old, who gave birth last week after being raped by her stepfather, prevented a second tragedy. ""Let nobody be misled, a 10-year-old girl being raped is horrible, but does it solve a problem by taking the life of an innocent child?"" he asked. He added later, ""When I think about one horror, I also think about the possibilities that exist and I just don't want to think that somehow we discounted a human life ... Let's not compound the tragedy by taking yet another life.""Paraguay law allows abortion only “in very rare cases when it’s deemed necessary to save a woman’s life,” ThinkProgress noted. Huckabee has taken a firm stance against abortion and suggested last month that he wouldn't rule out using federal troops to stop women from accessing the procedure. He also identifies with a small group of conservative legal scholars who believe the Constitution gives the president the power to outlaw abortion, despite the Supreme Court's many rulings on the matter.

5,TRAVEL,European Vacation -- in Philadelphia!,"Lev Raphael, ContributorAuthor, reviewer, and blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/european-vacation--in-phi_b_7958790.html,Of course it felt a bit like an outpost of the gorgeous museum in Paris -- but without seeming imitative or second best.  This museum had its own special grace and logic.,2015-08-16,2015-08-13-1439484174-6501791-museerodin4ba2573341b4d.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-08-13-1439484174-6501791-museerodin4ba2573341b4d-thumb.jpg,"None of the friends I told about going to see Philadelphia's Rodin Museum this month knew it was there. I confess I hadn't either until fairly recently, but once I did, I was determined to visit. On my first trip to Paris years ago, French friends had recommended the Rodin Museum along with other small museums like the Picasso, the Cluny and the Carnavalet as places that I would love for their size and lack of crazy crowds. They were right and I'd suggest starting at the Rodin for its setting and collection when you go to Paris -- it's an ideal introduction to the city's spirit.Loving Rodin's work, I was primed for quiet glory when I got to Philadelphia. But I wasn't prepared for the stupefying heat that smacked me with a furious migraine when I left the airport, which only got worse in a cab that felt like a sauna. Yes, the cab had air conditioning -- but not enough to battle my nausea and vertigo.Now, we've all had those travel moments were we think, ""I wish I were home."" Well, mine started to dissipate when I checked into my hotel and saw the view from my 27th floor balcony. I felt transported to somewhere in Europe. It was cool, elegant, classic. That's a good way of describing Philadelphia's recently-restored Rodin Museum, which has the largest collection of Rodin's work outside Paris. It's housed in a gorgeous neoclassical building in lovely landscaping on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The grounds are, an oasis in that city, the building a refuge of cool textures and lines, a setting for work of magnetic brilliance. Rodin's ""Burghers of Calais"" are there, ""The Thinker,"" and many dramatic portrait busts of artists and politicians. There's radiant, compelling beauty at every turn.The Museum was hushed and cool when I visited, small enough to allow for as much contemplation as you wanted, for losing yourself in the textures, lines, emotions and stories of each piece, imagined and real. Of course it felt a bit like an outpost of the gorgeous museum in Paris -- but without seeming imitative or second best. This museum had its own special grace and logic. It's a perfect achievement in its own right, filled with wonders large and small that made Rodin himself, or at least his artistic imagination, seem constantly present and enveloping.Dinner that evening seemed appropriate at Parc Restaurant and Bistro and I lucked out at having a charming server, Déborah, from Nantes, a large city in Northwest France. She complimented my somewhat rusty French once I realized where she was from and started using it (I remembered enough to recount an anecdote about a friend's shopping misadventure in Paris). France has been a favorite travel destination of mine for many years and though I've eaten at Michelin-starred restaurants and a chateau with a cooking school, I was in heaven surveying the menu with one classic bistro dish after another. That's my preferred style these days. I ordered Badoit for table water and the beer I first began drinking in France years ago: Kronenbourg. My starter was a delectable tuna Carpaccio. I couldn't make up my mind among all the terrific choices for entree, but the ambiance made me go for that bistro classic, steak-frites, which was perfectly prepared and mouth-watering. The Bordeaux I drank was a strong complement. I sighed with contentment a lot during this meal. I admired the graceful and unhurried service (even the killer bread), which I associate with being in Paris -- or Western Europe in general. At the end, my dessert, a pistachio and strawberry concoction, was a standout, and I savored it with a glass of sublime Calvados. Espresso was the natural finish to a terrific meal where I'd happily lost all sense of time.I loved the classic Parisian feel of the bistro, down to the sidewalk tables which were great for people watching and looked out on gorgeous Rittenhouse Square. I would highly recommend an evening there when you're in Philadelphia -- or two if you have the time. I wish I could have gone back.For me, Parc brought back happy memories of dozens of lunches and dinners in Paris and created some new ones. Can you ask more of a trip, and one so close to home? As for the migraine... My medication finally worked, but I'm sure the art, fine food and wine helped just as much."

We hope to dig deeper and showcase stories, advice and lessons from founders, investors and other key players in the growing startup ecosystem all over the world. You can sign up to stay up to date with this series here. Back in the Echelon Conference, we interviewed 3 different women venture capitalists. So far, we've written about Ardent Capital's Tee Suraphongcai and 500 Startups' Edith Yeung. Today, we're featuring Tina Cheng from Cherubic Ventures. Tina had worked in Silicon Valley tech giants Yahoo and CISCO before deciding to return to her home country Taiwan to become an entrepreneur. She teamed up with a friend to start an education startup that she would run for 2 years. This gave her the opportunity to gain some real operational experience of growing a company from zero to something. However, the everyday grind of running a startup would bite Tina as she recalled struggling after 2 years of running the company because of the stagnant growth they had hit entering their 3rd year. While the company is still up and running up to today, Tina decided to leave after 2 years for a change in scenery. She recalled, ""I didn't have a mentor at that time who could've told me that this stagnant growth was normal and that sometimes you just have to plow through these phases.""Her experience both in the Valley and in Taiwan would help her build her network and prepare her for the venture capital (VC) world.She shared, ""I now have a big network and a lot of contacts both in the Silicon Valley ecosystem and Taiwan that really helped me get to where I am today which is at early stage investment, knowing entrepreneurs and being a good judge of character.""She highlighted how you have to be ""able to decide if this person has the right qualities to run this startup or does this startup company have the necessary ingredients to be successful in the space they're in now.""Early Stage VC - More than a science  When we asked Tina what she looks for when investing, she talked about early stage investing being more of an art rather than a science. She shared, ""If you talk to a lot of early stage investors, they'll tell you the same thing. When you're an early stage startup, you don't really have revenue. A lot of them only have a prototype or an idea some times. In that scenario, you're only looking at the entrepreneurs and the team.""However, she also shared with us how what they look for in China and US also differ. She shared, ""In the US, we want to look for teams that are really really strong in their domain expertise and they usually have really really strong product vision.""Tina added, ""Where does this founder/team want to take this product to a future that no one can see right now? A lot of the products that you see today like Snapchat, Airbnb and Uber, when they first started out, people thought they were crazy right but the founder didn't just give up.""This is the product vision and belief in yourself that Tina looks for when investing. She highlighted how it's easier to trust a founder who has a strong product vision and has the technology in the Western world because there's a higher chance that they'll actually see things through even if the idea is crazy.On the other hand, in China and Asia, the product innovation that happens is a bit different. Tina shared, ""The startup ideas aren't necessarily groundbreaking or innovative or they may not have the strongest technology but the founders in Asia have to be really good at finding traction, finding users and taking market share.""She highlighted how successful founders in Asia are usually very charismatic, move really fast, understand how to find and get a large user base, and most importantly, how to outpace the competition.  Here's Tina during the Tech in Asia Taipei tour (Photo taken from Tech in Asia)Trends in Taiwan  Tina shared how in Taiwan you will see a really strong manufacturing industry and people who work really really hard. She mentioned how NEST and Fitbit actually have their products made in Taiwan.At the same time, Tina is happy to see how the government is starting to push for the growth of a lot of businesses and startups in Taiwan. She mentioned how there is now more funding from the government and the government has created incentives for international investors to not only invest in Taiwan but to also bring in international know how, mentorship and partnership to the ecosystem.While India and China are the main powerhouses in Asia right now, Tina mentioned how Taiwan is trying to find its positioning and transition from manufacturing to looking for the next big wave. She shared, ""It could be in the 'Internet of Things' space. They're also trying to develop more software talent.""She added, ""A lot of entrepreneurs in Taiwan are coming to the US to find investors. They apply to Y Combinator and 500 Startups so they're aware that to be successful, they'll have to step out of Taiwan as well to look for the opportunities.""Common Mistakes of Founders in Asia  We then moved on to discuss common mistakes Tina sees in founders. The first mistake she pointed out was the lack of product testing and user testing early on. She shared, ""Right now, it's really super easy to test a product idea and start a company but you will be amazed how many pitches we get where founders pitch ideas and have a massive plan but haven't gone out to test it and ask people if they want to use it.""She added, ""They spend a lot of time building this sophisticated product only to find out that there no market for it. They put more emphasis on the product but they forget the market.""The second problem she sees in entrepreneurs is that they're not willing to invest in people. She shared, ""A lot of Asians are very reluctant or are slower to hire great talent. They're less willing to pay to get the best talent. They're a lot more traditional and they're less risk-taking.""However, Tina also believes that right now in Asia, a lot of people want to stay in big companies so startups really have to out-pay the big companies to get the best talent. Being a VC calls for a lot of networking and speaking with founders (Photo taken from Tech in Asia)What she looks for when investing  Tina believes that entrepreneurs really have to be a little bit crazy to succeed. She shared, ""It's a good balance of not caring about what other people say to you because you can't let that affect you but you also need to know when to take advice but you have to stay optimistic and hopeful all the time because it's so hard and once you get and you're down and the entire office can feel it.""But how do you stay optimistic all throughout? One of the key drivers Tina shared with us was just having conviction, whatever it is you're dong. She added, ""We see a lot of times, the difference between success and failure is whether or not you can pull through and make it even when the times are bad.""Persevering despite being rejected multiple times is one example Tina gave. She shared, ""Years ago, nobody told me how important that outlook is. They tell you to think about whether your product is good enough or if you've found the right people but actually you also need to have the right attitude. Your attitude will decide if you can persevere."" While it won't always workout, staying optimistic can help you last longer. However, at the same time, you have to be able to tell whether or not your company really has a shot. If the answer is yes, Tina advices, ""You just have to plow through no matter how hard it is. Sometimes, it's a dead end but you'll never really know.""Indeed hindsight is twenty-twenty but you just have to take your chances. Challenges in Venture Capital  With so many new funds popping up in Asia, Tina shared how even venture capitalists have a lot of pressure to produce results. She shared, ""More people are looking into deals and that pushes the valuation really high and so as an investor you also have to ask yourself should I invest. Is it a good company? Does this make sense?""A lot of hard questions and decisions to make but of course, luck also play a big role in the success of these startups. Tina shared, ""Timing and everything. A lot of things go into making a successful startup. There's no one formula. If everything we invest goes bust, we don't have a next fund.""One key thing about the venture capital industry though is relationships and knowing people.Tina shared, ""One key thing especially about early stage venture capital is that its extremely relationship based. A lot of times, you're meeting founders, startups, and other investors. You're not just in the office everyday.""While Tina didn't expect this level of networking, she looks forward to the challenge of finding the right companies to invest in. Only time will tell what companies these will be. ---About the Author---David Ongchoco is a student entrepreneur and avid storyteller from the Philippines studying at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in what he likes to call, LIFE.

We hope to dig deeper and showcase stories, advice and lessons from founders, investors and other key players in the growing startup ecosystem all over the world. You can sign up to stay up to date with this series here. Back in the Echelon Conference, we interviewed 3 different women venture capitalists. So far, we've written about Ardent Capital's Tee Suraphongcai and 500 Startups' Edith Yeung. Today, we're featuring Tina Cheng from Cherubic Ventures. Tina had worked in Silicon Valley tech giants Yahoo and CISCO before deciding to return to her home country Taiwan to become an entrepreneur. She teamed up with a friend to start an education startup that she would run for 2 years. This gave her the opportunity to gain some real operational experience of growing a company from zero to something. However, the everyday grind of running a startup would bite Tina as she recalled struggling after 2 years of running the company because of the stagnant growth they had hit entering their 3rd year. While the company is still up and running up to today, Tina decided to leave after 2 years for a change in scenery. She recalled, ""I didn't have a mentor at that time who could've told me that this stagnant growth was normal and that sometimes you just have to plow through these phases.""Her experience both in the Valley and in Taiwan would help her build her network and prepare her for the venture capital (VC) world.She shared, ""I now have a big network and a lot of contacts both in the Silicon Valley ecosystem and Taiwan that really helped me get to where I am today which is at early stage investment, knowing entrepreneurs and being a good judge of character.""She highlighted how you have to be ""able to decide if this person has the right qualities to run this startup or does this startup company have the necessary ingredients to be successful in the space they're in now.""Early Stage VC - More than a science  When we asked Tina what she looks for when investing, she talked about early stage investing being more of an art rather than a science. She shared, ""If you talk to a lot of early stage investors, they'll tell you the same thing. When you're an early stage startup, you don't really have revenue. A lot of them only have a prototype or an idea some times. In that scenario, you're only looking at the entrepreneurs and the team.""However, she also shared with us how what they look for in China and US also differ. She shared, ""In the US, we want to look for teams that are really really strong in their domain expertise and they usually have really really strong product vision.""Tina added, ""Where does this founder/team want to take this product to a future that no one can see right now? A lot of the products that you see today like Snapchat, Airbnb and Uber, when they first started out, people thought they were crazy right but the founder didn't just give up.""This is the product vision and belief in yourself that Tina looks for when investing. She highlighted how it's easier to trust a founder who has a strong product vision and has the technology in the Western world because there's a higher chance that they'll actually see things through even if the idea is crazy.On the other hand, in China and Asia, the product innovation that happens is a bit different. Tina shared, ""The startup ideas aren't necessarily groundbreaking or innovative or they may not have the strongest technology but the founders in Asia have to be really good at finding traction, finding users and taking market share.""She highlighted how successful founders in Asia are usually very charismatic, move really fast, understand how to find and get a large user base, and most importantly, how to outpace the competition.

Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-and-the-kurdish-co_b_7994540.html,The history of Tal Abyad is a metaphor of the Syrian civil war and of the ambivalence in the larger motives of the various actors engaged in the ongoing struggle to expel Islamic State (IS) jihadists from the region.,2015-08-16,2015-08-16-1439738948-1189542-Northern_Syria_offensive_2015.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-08-16-1439738948-1189542-Northern_Syria_offensive_2015-thumb.png,"The history of Tal Abyad is a metaphor of the Syrian civil war and of the ambivalence in the larger motives of the various actors engaged in the ongoing struggle to expel Islamic State (IS) jihadists from the region. The Syrian town lies along the Turkish border with Syria, mirrored by the Turkish town of Akcakale on the opposite side of the frontier.Its population is a mix of Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Turkmen. Historically, the town of some 50,000 people was an important border crossing between Syria and Turkey. During the Syrian Civil War its importance has been underscored by its proximity, less than 50 miles, to the Islamic State's capital, Ar Raqqah. The border crossing was an important transit point for jihadist fighters traveling from Turkey to join IS militants in Syria as well as being an important smuggling route for the Islamic State.Islamic State jihadists captured the town on June 30, 2014. They overran the Kurdish forces, comprised of YPG (People's Protection Units) and the Kurdish Front Brigade which were defending the town. The YPG is the Syrian offshoot of the PKK (Kurdistan Worker's Party). The PKK is a militant, secular, leftist organization based in Turkey that has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for self-determination of the Kurds in Turkey. The Kurds comprise between 15% and 20% of Turkey's populace. The PKK has been implicated in hundreds of attacks against Turkish security forces and has been branded a terrorist organization by both Turkey and the United States. Both organizations are separate and distinct from the Peshmerga, the military forces of the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. Although the various Kurdish groups in Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran share a common ethnicity and culture, politically and ideologically they are very different. On July 21, 2014 IS militants announced that all Kurdish inhabitants had to leave Tal Abyad or they would be killed. Thousands of the town's inhabitants, including Turkmen and Sunni Arab families, promptly fled. Islamic State militants systematically looted the abandoned homes and resettled displaced Arab refugees from the surrounding region.  YPK Northern Syrian Offensive April-August 2015A year later, on June 15, 2015, the town was recaptured by a combination of YPG, Free Syrian Army (FSA) forces and a variety of Arab militias operating under the umbrella of the Burkan al-Furat (The Euphrates Volcano), the YPG-FSA ""joint operations room"", supported by air power from the U.S. and its coalition partners. Following the battle, U.S. officials praised YPG troops as being the most reliable of the ground forces working with the U.S. to roll back the Islamic State. The victory was seen as striking proof of how the combination of overwhelming American air power and effective and reliable boots on the ground could decisively defeat Islamic State forces. The capture of Tal Abyad had another consequence. By combining Kurdish control of the Kobani and Jazeera cantons it created a ""Kurdish corridor"" extending from Iraqi Kurdistan all the way to the city of Kobani in north-central Syria. It thus linked up two of the three current autonomous Kurdish zones in Syria, in the process forming the nucleus of, what the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan fears, will, potentially, be a Kurdish controlled zone that could someday serve as the core of an autonomous Kurdish state. ""Kurdish Corridor"" in Northern Syria, August 2015Some Kurdish groups have already declared this region to be autonomous from Syria, calling it Rojava. It is also referred to as Western Kurdistan to distinguish it from Eastern, i.e., Iraqi Kurdistan. To date, no government has officially recognized the independence of Rojava. This ""Kurdish Corridor"" is a 250 mile stretch of territory along the Turkish border averaging about 50 miles wide running from the border of Iraqi Kurdistan to the outskirts of Jarablus on the west bank of the Euphrates River. Although the population of the region is approximately 40% to 50% ethnic Kurds, it also includes large numbers of Sunni Arabs and Turkoman. Both groups have been cooperating with the PKK in the campaign to expel Islamic State jihadists. Politically and culturally, however, they have little in common with the secular PKK. The prospects of an autonomous Kurdish state in the region would raise fears of an ethnic cleansing of non-Kurdish inhabitants and would quickly disintegrate the nascent coalition. Islamic State propaganda has been quick to capitalize on those fears, warning Arabs in the region that they would be expelled from their homes if the PKK's plans for a ""Kurdish Corridor"" are successful. Unofficially, the Turkish government has echoed similar comments.Within weeks of the recapture of Tal Abyad, Turkey announced that its air forces would join the U.S. led air campaign against Islamic State. In a statement issued on July 24, Turkish officials confirmed that following a telephone conversation between U.S. President Obama and Turkish President Erdogan on July 22, Turkey would allow American use of a number of air bases in Turkey, including the giant air base at Incirlik, to stage air operations against Islamic State targets in Syria. The use of these Turkish bases would reduce the air time of American air forces to their Islamic State targets to less than 30 minutes. On July 24, three Turkish F-16 fighters struck Islamic State targets in the Syrian border town of Hawar Kilis. A few hours later, Turkish air forces struck positions in northern Iraq being manned by PKK forces. Since then scores of Turkish air attacks have been launched. A disproportionate number of those air attacks have been directed at Kurdish forces operating in Syria and Iraq. Concurrently, Turkish government sources declared that Turkey and the United States had agreed to form an ""ISIS free buffer zone"" along the Turkish border north of Aleppo and that both governments had agreed that Kurdish forces would not be allowed to push west of the Euphrates River. In addition, there were widespread reports that the Turkish government was organizing a separate Turkoman militia force that it would fund and arm to use as a potential block to Kurdish forces. The Turkish proposal for an ""ISIS free buffer zone"" would prevent Kurdish forces from potentially capturing control of the seventy odd mile strip of land north of Aleppo and along the Turkish border that would allow them to link up with Kurdish forces in Afrin. That link up would cement the final leg of a Kurdish corridor from Iraqi Kurdistan to the Mediterranean Sea. Not only would such a corridor be a critical element in the formation of a future autonomous Kurdish state but, more importantly, it would allow the direct export of petroleum from Iraqi Kurdistan via Mediterranean ports. Significantly, Kurdish forces in northern Syria have disclosed that they were no longer receiving U.S. air support in its ground offensive against Islamic State forces in Jarablus. This city is the last major border crossing between Syria and Turkey still controlled by Islamic State and is critical to the flow of Jihadists into Syria as well as a key conduit for IS smuggling operations. The Pentagon has declined to either confirm or deny the Kurdish claim that they are no longer receiving American air support for operations west of the Euphrates River. More concerning, however, is mounting evidence of past Turkish government collusion with Islamic State. On July 25, The Guardian disclosed that U.S. Special Forces had captured ""hundreds of flash drives and documents"" when, on the night of May 15-16, 2015, they had raided the compound of Islamic State's financial chief, Abu Sayyaf. The documents showed there had been widespread collusion by Turkish government officials in the smuggling of oil from Islamic State controlled oil fields in eastern Syria. Stolen antiquities, another lucrative source of revenue for the Islamic State, were also being smuggled out of Syria with the tacit consent of Turkish officials. Indeed, it's possible that the highly publicized destruction of archeological sites in Syria and Iraq by Islamic State was nothing more than a cover for the systematic looting and sale of artifacts from these archeological remains. According to The Guardian, ""direct dealings between Turkish officials and ranking ISIS members was now undeniable."" Smuggled oil alone was responsible for generating between $1 million and $4 million a day in revenues for Islamic State. For now, the United States finds itself in a position where a key ally, Turkey, is effectively at war with the one ground force, the Kurds, that, when supported by American air power, have been the most effective in rolling back the Islamic State. The Turkish government has made it clear that given a choice between defeating Islamic State and forestalling any possibility of an independent Kurdish state along its southern border, it will opt to go to war against the Kurdish YPG and to tolerate the continued existence of the Islamic State. Under those circumstances is it any wonder that the Islamic State continues to survive?"

No state funds were used for abortions, except in the case of incest, rape or when the life of the mother was at stake.Several conservative state legislators had urged Hutchinson to end all state payments to Planned Parenthood, citing the videos.Federal law requires state Medicaid programs to cover family-planning services and supplies for anyone of child-bearing age. Ending the agreements with Planned Parenthood would limit beneficiaries' access to care and services from qualified providers of their choice, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Alabama and Louisiana, which have also sought to end their agreements with Planned Parenthood, were cautioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that their actions could put them afoul of federal regulations which make any qualified provider eligible to participate in the program.Planned Parenthood, which provides healthcare services to millions of women at hundreds of centers nationwide, has denied any wrongdoing. The organization also says abortions make up 3 percent of its work."

I'm gonna let whatever this inquiry is go forward and we'll await the outcome of it,"" Clinton told reporters at the Iowa State Fair, where she was endorsed by Tom Harkin, the state's former Democratic senator. ""It's not anything people talk to me about as I travel around the country. It is never raised in my town halls, it is never raised in my other meetings with people.""In a HuffPost/YouGov poll in late July, 60 percent of respondents said that Clinton's use of a personal email address was a somewhat serious problem. The same poll found that Republicans were five times more likely to describe Clinton's personal email usage as a very serious problem.Clinton's comments came after she turned over her personal server and her lawyer handed in a thumb drive with emails that she had already submitted to the State Department. This week, McClatchy also reported that two emails on the server had been found to contain information classified as top secret. The FBI is investigating how such sensitive material wound up on Clinton's server, though Clinton herself is not the target of the investigation, The New York Times reported.Clinton also said that attacks on her email are partisan and accused Republicans of politicizing the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left four dead, including ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.""I do think if you look at the Republicans in Congress, the ones running for president, there is an unfortunate tendency to try to make partisan a tragedy in Benghazi,"" she said. ""This is the usual partisanisation [sic] of anything that goes on.""The former secretary of state on Friday joked about the investigation, saying how much she loved Snapchat, a picture and video message service that automatically deletes messages.""I love it, I love it.

But the vote could expose a deep divide among Merkel's conservatives, damaging the German leader and her close ally Volker Kauder, the head of her bloc in parliament.Kauder, who incensed fellow lawmakers last week with threats of retaliation if they rebelled and voted against a bailout, has described the involvement of the International Monetary Fund as a ""condition"" for the support of his party.However under the bailout approved by euro zone finance ministers at a meeting in Brussels late on Friday, it is unclear whether the IMF will end up playing a role.IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the ministers by telephone that she could not commit until her board reviewed the situation in the autumn. She renewed a call for ""significant"" debt relief for Greece, a demand Merkel's government has repeatedly pushed back against.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble reiterated his opposition to an outright writedown of the face value of Greek debt in an interview with Deutsche Welle published on Saturday. He said the scope for milder forms of debt relief, like extending debt maturities, was ""not very big.""The IMF took part in the first two rescues for Greece, which totalled 240 billion euros, and Berlin is keen to keep it on board because of the Washington-based institution's reputation for rigor.RISK OF BIG REBELLIONLast month, a record 65 lawmakers from Merkel's conservative camp broke ranks and refused to back negotiations on the bailout.Far more could rebel in Wednesday's vote, with top-selling German daily Bild estimating that up to 120 members of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), may refuse to back the government.The Bundestag debate on Greece is scheduled to start at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Wednesday, disrupting Merkel's travel plans.She had been scheduled to leave on a government trip to Brazil around that time. Her spokesman Steffen Seibert said the departure would be delayed by several hours.Merkel will also move forward to Monday a planned trip to Milan. She had been due to travel there for talks with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Tuesday, but will now stay in Berlin that day to lobby conservative lawmakers on the bailout.If 100 or more of her conservative allies rebel in the vote it would be seen as a major political setback for the chancellor, who remains highly popular after 10 years in office.""The government is in a real quandary,"" said Greens leaders Katrin Goering-Eckardt and Anton Hofreiter in a statement. ""It can't demand IMF involvement and at the same time refuse its demands for debt relief.""A large rebellion would be an even bigger danger for Kauder, whose threat last weekend to sanction lawmakers who voted against the bailout by removing them from key parliamentary committees appears to have backfired, firing up the ""No"" camp.Senior Merkel allies Ralph Brinkhaus and Eckhardt Rehberg tried to put a positive spin on the Greek deal, noting that Schaeuble had won concessions on privatizations and that the first tranche of aid, at 26 billion euros, would be smaller than initially planned, keeping Athens on a tight leash.""What the IMF is saying about its future involvement is positive - even if it isn't ready to commit until the autumn,"" they said.But Bild asked in a full-page spread: ""How dangerous is it getting for Merkel?"". The paper said it would be a ""political catastrophe"" for her should she fail to get a majority of her 311-strong conservative bloc in parliament to back the deal.Also on HuffPost:"
