Trayon Christian, 19, an engineering student, says he bought a $349 Ferragamo belt at Barneys and was promptly collared by undercover cops, who asked, 'How could you afford a belt like this? Where did you get this money from? The teenager is shopping for justice, claiming snooty Barneys staffers and New York City cops racially profiled him for credit card fraud after he bought a $349 belt. Christian told the Daily News he filed a lawsuit after he was targeted by staffers at Barneys' and detained by police because they didn't believe he could possibly afford to buy such an expensive belt.

As one of your most famous songs reminds us, you're not a mind-reader. But they will blame you. Timing is everything and the seeming hypocrisy of a rapper who's rhymed about racial profiling and police misconduct now promoting a $33,000 watch at the infamous department store is too juicy of a headline to ignore. And, to be fair, it's been several days now since the news broke that Trayon Christian, a 19-year-old engineering student from Queens, is suing Barneys and the NYPD for racial discrimination after purchasing a $349 Ferragamo belt from the store. He was stopped just after exiting, handcuffed and detained in a jail cell until the police ran out of reasons to keep holding him.It's been several days, too, since the follow-up story of Kayla Phillips, a 21-year-old nursing student, who was swarmed by undercover cops after buying a designer handbag at the same store back in February. She too is planning to sue Barneys and the police.Barneys itself has gone into crisis management mode, issuing a statement acknowledging that the treatment of the two shoppers was unacceptable and hiring a civil rights attorney to lead a review of its fairness and equality practices.  But still no words from you, Jay-Z -- one of the most prolific wordsmiths of a generation.To be honest with you, I couldn't care less whether you keep Barneys' money. It won't change a reality of more than 700,000 people -- mostly Black and Latino -- stopped and frisked by the NYPD in a single year. It won't change the reality that our culture encourages the criminalization of communities of color. But I do believe that you, along with the rest of Black America, deserve to know more about what's happening outside those department store windows -- so many unanswered questions remain.We should know more about the other 50 people arrested near the retail outlet -- who they are, the racial makeup of the group. Whether they were eventually charged or let go? And what was Barneys' role, if any, in those arrests? That's why ColorOfChange members are calling on NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly to conduct a full investigation into the arrests. Others are speaking out as well. Rev. Sharpton and the National Action Network have demanded a meeting with Barneys' executives and a Change.org petition, urging you to reconsider your contract has already made headlines. Should you break your silence, perhaps you could speak out and join us in holding the NYPD accountable too. It may be just a 45-minute subway ride from Brooklyn to the Barneys flagship on the Upper East Side, but you of all people know just how long that journey really feels. Throughout your career, you have been the voice of a generation of Black men who daily endure profiling and harassment from police officers. Why stop talking now?Rashad Robinson is executive director of ColorOfChange -- the nation's largest online civil rights organization.

""People still emphasise having an heir and passing on the family name.""On a cool autumn day, the 11th annual parade was marked by colourful costumes, plenty of exposed skin, musical performances and vendors lining the route to and from the city hall.Spokeswoman Meico Tsai praised the liberal attitudes that have put Taiwan far ahead of its neighbours in terms of tolerance of gays. ""Compared to other Asian countries, we're more open, but we still have a long way to go,"" she said.Sexual-orientation education is a part of the primary school curriculum and LGBT individuals enjoy legal protection from hiring discrimination and other forms of prejudice.""Korea is much more conservative,"" said South Korean national Carmen Yoon, a first-time attendee. ""I hope Taiwan will legalise gay marriage and we can follow their example.""Taiwan, where Chinese nationalist forces fled after being defeated by the Communists in 1949, is a self-governing nation that is claimed by China. A former dictatorship, it underwent a peaceful transition to democracy in the 1980s and has developed one of the most thriving civil societies in Asia.Mainland China maintains a largely indifferent attitude toward LGBT issues as cities boast thriving yet underground gay cultures. Legal protections are virtually nonexistent and though gay marriage has been proposed in Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament, it has never been placed on the agenda.New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to permit same-sex marriage this year and the Australian Capital Territory approved the measure this week.Neil Peng, co-writer of ""The Wedding Banquet"", an early film focusing on a same-sex relationship, said Taiwan's gay community had been helped by uncensored discussion in the arts.He pointed to the effect throughout Chinese-speaking countries of the best-selling book ""Crystal Boys"".""These kinds of works force people to face facts,"" he said.

2,BUSINESS,NYSE Runs Twitter IPO Test To Avoid  Facebook Chaos,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/twitter-ipo-test-nyse_us_5bb300b3e4b0480ca661084d,"The Big Board, run by NYSE Euronext, regularly does systems testing on the weekends, but this was the first time it had run",2013-10-26,"A user checks a Twitter feed on a smartphone in this arranged photograph taken in London, U.K., on Friday, Oct. 4, 2013. Twitter Inc.'s initial public offering documents suggested a valuation of $12.8 billion for the microblogging service, underscoring the seven-year rise of a still unprofitable company that has helped revolutionize how people share information. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb300b22500003600389a40.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By John McCrankNEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange on Saturday did a test run of Twitter's highly anticipated market debut, as it seeks to avoid the types of problems that plagued Facebook's initial public offering on rival Nasdaq.The Big Board, run by NYSE Euronext, regularly does systems testing on the weekends, but this was the first time it had run a simulated IPO, and it did so at the request of its member firms - many of whom took part in Facebook's 2012 IPO on Nasdaq OMX Group's main exchange.The NYSE was testing mainly for two things: To see if its systems could handle the amount of message traffic that might be generated by the IPO; and to make sure that once the IPO took place any firms that placed orders would promptly receive the reports telling them that their orders had been executed.It can also be seen as part of NYSE's struggle with Nasdaq for supremacy in technology listings. Both exchanges vied to be home to Twitter's stock, and many analysts said the trading disruptions that occurred on Facebook's Nasdaq debut likely played to NYSE's favor, as it tries to become the destination of choice for technology listings, something Nasdaq once dominated.Twitter, which intends to sell 70 million shares at between $17 and $20 each, will be holding the biggest Internet IPO since Facebook, which sold a much larger 421 million shares at $38 each. Twitter is expected to start trading as early as November 7.In the case of Facebook, the tremendous volume of orders on the first day of trading exposed a glitch in Nasdaq's system, ultimately preventing timely order confirmations for many traders, leaving them unsure about their exposure for hours, and in some cases for days afterwards. Major market makers estimated they lost collectively up to $500 million in the IPO.The absence of Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld while the meltdown was occurring magnified the criticism toward the exchange - he had been celebrating the debut at Facebook's California headquarters before jumping on a plane back to New York.Nasdaq was fined $10 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission - the largest fine ever for an exchange - and said it would voluntarily pay up to $62 million to compensate firms that had been harmed. On Friday, Nasdaq said $41.6 million of claims put forward qualified for the compensation plan.The chaotic debut also contributed to a decline in Facebook's stock. The stock hit a low of $17.55 in August, though it has since more than recovered the losses, closing on Friday at $51.95, well above its IPO price.While Nasdaq had tested its systems in the lead-up to the IPO, allowing member firms to place dummy orders to a test symbol over a specific period, it limited the total number of orders that could be received in the simulation to 40,000. On the day of the IPO, over 496,000 orders were placed before the IPO opened, with around 82 million shares traded. By the end of the day, more than 500 million shares had traded hands, a record for an IPO.NYSE's tests on Saturday ran hundreds of thousands of orders, with one single firm placing an order at one point for nearly 81 million shares.""This morning's systems test was successful, and we're grateful to all the firms that chose to participate,"" an NYSE spokesman said. ""We are being very methodical in our planning for Twitter's IPO, and are working together with the industry to ensure a world-class experience for Twitter, retail investors and all market participants.""THREE TEST IPOSOn an average trading day, there are around 700 people on the floor of the Big Board dressed in business suits, many also wearing blue jackets with their firms' names emblazoned on them.On Saturday, about 20 people - floor operators, technicians, and designated market makers, who are akin to air traffic controllers for stocks, overseeing trading and ensuring fair and orderly markets - gathered in small groups around various screens, dressed in jeans and sipping coffees.At 7 a.m., just as they would for an actual IPO, over 20 NYSE member firms began sending in their orders for the Twitter IPO simulation. The market opened up as it normally would at 9:30 a.m., but in this case using data from Friday to recreate a normal environment with 3,800 listed stock trading. IPO orders kept coming in and NYSE had a phone line open to keep members apprised of the situation and to answer questions.Shortly before 10 a.m., the first of three test IPOs to mimic the Twitter debut took place, using the symbol IPOA.The designated market maker (DMM), in this case a representative from Barclays, ran the auction, with orders coming in electronically on a screen and from brokers on the floor using hand-held computers.A major difference between NYSE's system and Nasdaq's is that Nasdaq's is fully electronic, while NYSE's normal IPO procedures include human intervention, through the DMM.Once a price had been determined, based on the orders that had come in, and following communication with the investment bankers and brokers, the DMM froze the order book and hit a blue ""DONE"" button on his keyboard. Immediately after, alerts went off on the brokers' handheld devices indicating their orders had been executed.A NYSE employee on the floor wearing a Bluetooth earpiece, who was connected to the call with member firms, called out the action as it happened.The exercise was completed two more times, using test symbols IPOB and IPOC, with KCG Holdings and Goldman Sachs as DMMs, and with saws and drills buzzing in the background from weekend renovations, instead of the usual din of traders.Both NYSE and Nasdaq have said 2013 is shaping up to be their best IPO year in more than half a decade.(Reporting by John McCrank; editing by Gunna Dickson)"

They said it represented the largest ever bitcoin seizure.Ulbricht's lawyer could not immediately be reached on Friday evening, though he previously told reporters that Ulbricht denied the charges.Since it began operations in 2011, Silk Road provided an anonymous site where drug dealers, counterfeiters and other criminals could shop for everything from heroin to hit men, according to the Justice Department.More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using bitcoins, according to authorities. The currency, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking bitcoins to Silk Road.With nearly 30,000 bitcoins previously seized, federal agents have now collected more than $33 million in bitcoins, based on current value, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said.The seizures were carried out as part of a corresponding civil action against Silk Road and Ulbricht. Ulbricht, who is detained in California, is expected to appear within weeks in Manhattan federal court to face criminal charges of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.Court documents allege that Silk Road saw some $1.2 billion in bitcoins change hands during more than two years of operation and charged between 8 and 15 percent in commissions.(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

Once they die, he scoops them up by the shovel-full. Then he repeats the ritual.""It's literally a huge problem,"" said Stuckey, a Houston environmental attorney.Stuckey is one of several landowners who allow researchers to use their property to learn more about tawny crazy ants, a nuisance spreading rapidly across the U.S. Gulf Coast.Originally from South America, the ants were discovered in Texas in 2002, and there have been confirmed sightings in at least four other states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. They are ""within four miles of Alabama right now,"" according to research scientist Joe MacGown at the Mississippi Entomological Museum.The good news: Tawny crazy ants do not sting or bite like fire ants, which have been around since the 1970s.The bad news: Tawny ants multiply very quickly and like to make their home in warm, tight spaces including around electrical equipment, under floorboards and in car engines.Large swarms of the ants have been found in the mall area of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, although they have not done any significant damage, said NASA Houston Facilities Management and Operations Chief Shelia Powell in an email.""We are principally concerned about the possible damage to infrastructure such as electronics, employees' automobiles, and our facilities,"" Powell said.NASA uses a local extermination company, which has come up with a temporary strategy using frequent application of multiple products to kill them, she said.Still, not enough is known about their physiology to predict how far north or inland they will travel, and how best to eliminate them, experts said.""You almost have to see it to believe what a nuisance these can become,"" said Robert Puckett, an associate research scientist at Texas A&M University. ""I've been in people's houses where they show me trash bags full of ants they've swept up.""Diana Tahtinen, who owns a home south of Houston, estimates having spent about $1,000 a year for pest control during the last three years of battling the ants on her land.""It has a huge impact on your quality of life,"" she said.The ants hitch rides in landscaping and building materials and even on shoes or cars, which is common for invasive species, said David Oi, a research entomologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Although financial losses have not officially been tallied, Tom Rasberry, a Houston exterminator credited by local experts with discovering the ants in the U.S., believes that the costs over a decade of damage could be in the hundreds of millions.State and federal funds to combat the ants have been slow in coming, Puckett said. But Texas A&M has several projects in the works to learn more about the ants, thanks partly to state funding formerly reserved for fire ants that has now been opened up to tawny crazy ants.Traditional extermination chemicals do not seem to work.""You can spray and it will kill tens of thousands, but they come back,"" said Stuckey.

9,TRAVEL,Beautiful Bali: How to Enjoy It Despite the Crowds,"Lina Eroh, Contributor
Full Time Wanderer + Writer + Entrepreneur",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bali-travel_us_5b9d9cbfe4b03a1dcc8a3a15,"Bali isn't exactly an unknown destination and for some, that's a turn off. True the island is packed with tourists, but exploring the unique Balinese culture and temples, as well as the hidden beaches, is still worth your time.",2013-10-25,Lina ready to release a baby turtle on Kuta's beach in Bali,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-22-lina_and_baby_turtle.jpg,"Bali isn't exactly an unknown destination and for some, that's a turn off. True the island is packed with tourists, but exploring the unique Balinese culture and temples, as well as the hidden beaches, is still worth your time, especially when you consider the quality and affordability of the amenities. Your visit to Bali is best divided into two categories: beaches and culture.There are endless options for the former, but because we were short on time, we first settled on Kuta, a mere 4km from the airport.Kuta gets a bad rep for being a tourist trap full of drunk Australians, trash, and trashy t-shirts and bumper stickers. All this is pretty accurate, but you can find some peace if you make the effort.The beach is far from stunning, but it's decent, especially considering its proximity to a transport hub. It's also a good place to learn to surf, which is exactly what we did. Having surfed in Oahu, Hawaii, I can say with 100% certainty that Kuta isn't a great place to learn, no matter what the brochures tell you. The waves break too close to shore, which means you either get a very short ride (by hopping off quickly) or you crash into the sand and get all the respective tumble that comes with it. Sand burn hurts, so jumping off is better, but it results in little time on the board and lots of time spent dodging other surfers who don't know what they're doing.Besides surfing, we spent our time in Kuta checking out the temples, browsing the shops, and releasing baby turtles into the sea. On our second stop in Bali, we opted for a quieter beach to the south of Kuta. Tubon Beach, or Airport Beach as we called it for its perfect view of landing planes at the nearby airport, was a lot quieter and more peaceful than Kuta. There were hardly any touts, but if you wanted to catch waves you needed to charter a boat as they break farther offshore.Despite its positives, Tuban, like Kuta, was far from spectacular. For those types of beaches and that type of surfing, you need to rent a motorbike or taxi and head south to the Bukit Peninsula. The most famous beach here, and rightfully so, is Uluwatu. Make sure you make the right before paying for parking at the temple and follow the paved road all the way to the end. Head down the steps, through the rocky outcroppings, and discover this:You can spend all day here, at least while it's lowish tide, relaxing in the natural pools and watching the amazing surfers offshore. There's plenty of food to buy, so no need to bring anything along. And, if you're not convinced yet, it's just absolutely beautiful:More hidden beaches line the Bukit, but you'll have to follow the surfers or ask locals how to find them. We spent the rest of our day at Padang Padang, which was also accessed by a stunning staircase. If the main beach is crowded, head right. There are hardly any people to be found and the sand is even better.Other beaches you may want to check out are Bingin, Impossibles, and Balangan. Each offers an interesting access point and great surfing offshore. If you're looking for some beach dining, stop at Jimbaran on your way back to Kuta and grab some seafood in the sand. It's a tad pricey, so we had to skip the eating part, but the sunset was free -- and stunning.Unlike most of Indonesia, Bali is primarily a Hindu island, with all the ceremonies and offerings to match. Once you get off the main tourist drag in Kuta, you find yourself amidst beautiful mini temples and locals who put out offerings and light incense sticks throughout the day. Going inside the temples is difficult as the doors are often locked, but make sure to take a look around and keep an eye out for ceremonies and celebrations. We saw two large affairs -- one from our hotel balcony and the other right on the beach.If you like what you've seen in Kuta, then a few days at the inland town of Ubud will blow you away. Yes, it's full of tourists, but it's also full of Balinese locals performing the rituals that make up their days. Ceremonies and dance performances (both for tourists and locals) are aplenty, and you only need to get lost in the back alleys to stumble onto tiny temples and shrines that will blow your mind.Make sure to visit the Lotus Pond and the Royal Palace in town before taking trips further afield.We took an unguided walk along the Campuan Ridge one day and on another, chartered a car to Gunung Kawi and the Tegallalang rice terraces. You can ask for Goa Gajah, or Elephant Cave as it's commonly known, to be included in this route as well.Impressed? We know we were. Despite the crowds, there's still plenty to be discovered in Bali and its beautiful hotels and delicious food make it a great destination for any budget.
