0,HOME & LIVING,Crespi/Hicks Estate: A Cultural Icon Comes on the Market,"Douglas Newby, Contributor
Real estate broker specializing in Architecturally Significant...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crespi-hicks-estate-sale_us_5b9cbe21e4b03a1dcc81659f,One of the most extraordinary homes in the United States goes on the market.,2013-01-24,Original Photograph of Construciton at Crespi Hicks Estate,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-01-21-WalnutHill555550BW097550x309.jpg,"Once in a generation an extraordinary home in the United States might come on the market. That's occurring now in Dallas -- the Crespi/Hicks Estate, a home designed by Maurice Fatio and located on a 25-acre property, will shortly be available for purchase.It is a home that will help the world understand architectural significance, the sophistication and economic vibrancy of Dallas. It is a wonderful example of the great estate homes built in the 1920s and 1930s, and the result of the positive progression of preservation.Architectural significance starts with the estate's original architect, in this case, Swiss-born architect Maurice Fatio. He was voted the most popular architect in New York in the 1920s and he designed for prominent individuals and families including the Vanderbilts, the Duchess of Marlborough, the Stotesburys, Edward F.Hutton and Otto Kahn. The Crespi Estate was Fatio's architectural triumph, and his last great estate home, before his early death in his 40s.No extraordinary architecture is created without a client with a fine architectural sensibility, sophistication and an unrelenting vision. In this case, that client was Pio Crespi, a cotton merchant and an Italian count, and his wife, Florence. The couple retained Maurice Fatio to design their home, which was completed in 1939. The design of the Crespi Estate had been internationally vetted, enjoyed and celebrated for over 50 years when the current owners purchased it 16 years ago. With a cultivated eye, they were inspired to complete the original architectural vision of Maurice Fatio. With architect Peter Marino they honored, and further refined, the powerful architecture and perfect proportions that Maurice Fatio was known for in New York and Palm Beach in the 1920s and 1930s and is still celebrated today.Dallas has commanded world-wide attention with the I.M. Pei-designed Meyerson Symphony Center, the Sir Norman Foster-designed Winspear Opera House, the Renzo Piano-designed Nasher Sculpture Center, the Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince Ramos-designed Wyly Theater, the Brad Cleopfil-designed Booker T. Washington Arts Magnet School, the Thom Mayne-designed Perot Museum of Nature and Science and the Edward Larrabee Barnes-designed Dallas Museum of Art. These cultural spaces speak collectively to the community's commitment to the arts, education and architecture. The Crespi/Hicks Estate, considered by many to be the finest estate home in America, personifies the passion Dallas homeowners have for architecture and design. The Crespi/Hicks Estate also places the progression of preservation in a whole new light. For several decades, preservation has been associated with the preservation community and town councils using heavy-handed tactics and rhetoric to try and to save historically significant homes. Often these tactics fail and actually accelerate a structure's demise, spurring owners to tear down historic homes in the middle of the night to avoid pending restrictions.With an architectural magnet like the Crespi Estate, in an economically strong and culturally vibrant city, great things can happen. On their own volition, the current owners, without historic restrictions or preservationists' pleas, quietly acquired the original Crespi Estate and assembled an astute team of architects, designers and artisans to preserve and accentuate the aesthetics of the home.While many might assume that if an original 25-acre estate property is acquired, the original home would be torn down and 25 faux mansions would be built on one-acre lots. With this home, in this city and with these homeowners, the story is much different. It is almost always less expensive to build a new home rather than renovate an original architectural piece of art. With the Crespi/Hicks Estate, $2,000/square foot was carefully spent to renovate and complete the original Maurice Fatio-designed home, creating an estate home with enduring appeal and with real value.Dallas' strengths have always been the vision and business environment that allows and prompts efforts like this. Currently, Dallas, economically, is one of the strongest city in the country. It was the first to come out of the recession, its inventory of homes on the market is at a 12-year low, and the efforts of an entire generation of business leaders and philanthropic leaders is taking shape downtown and across the Dallas.As some cities fight for survival, Dallas continues to thrive economically and aesthetically. International, national and regional architects continue to win AIA awards for their Dallas-designed homes. For years, Fortune 500 companies have moved their headquarters to Dallas, and now both business and billionaires are finding economic and aesthetic reasons to make Dallas their home. Dallas has a great city manager and mayor, and more people than ever are moving to Dallas because they want to benefit from the economic environment and quality of life. The Crespi/Hicks Estate gives another compelling reason to move to Dallas.The Crespi/Hicks Estate, offered at $135,000,000, offers real economic value for the next owners. The price reflects the $2,000,000/acre land value and the $2,000/square foot cost of the improvements, including the main house, guest house and pool house. Land in Dallas' prestigious neighborhoods, such as Mayflower Estates, has doubled in value every eight years for the last 16 years. If land continues to appreciate at this rate, the next owners will have land worth $200,000,000 in the next 16 years.The home itself has one of the most important architectural pedigrees, and unlike new homes that depreciate, this home will have enduring value and become even more treasured as the home features artisanship, materials and a site that cannot be replicated, even if one had five or 10 years to commit to a residential project. Just as with artists and great pieces of art, such as Edvard Munch's The Scream that sold for $119.9 million in 2012, architectural masterpieces recede from the public consciousness until they are offered for sale.After raising six children, the current owners recently became empty nesters which has prompted this home to come on the market, allowing even those mildly interested in art, architecture and design the opportunity to become better acquainted with architecturally significant homes.The next owner of this home will have more than just a sophisticated interest in art and architecture, and the proper resources, the buyer will undoubtedly eschew the temporal and have a passion for the finest."

Maybe at some point in our lives, we must act.",2013-01-24,"A NYPD officer leads demonstrators over the Brooklyn bridge towards downtown Manhattan during a One Million Moms for Gun Control Rally, Jan. 21, 2012, in New York. Demonstrators called for new gun control legislation, demanding a ban on assault weapons and stricter regulations on gun purchases. The One Million Moms for Gun Control group formed in the wake of last month's massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbfe9240000310094cdcf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the reality of what happened in Sandy Hook fully registered, I was filled with helpless rage. Twenty children and six adults were mercilessly gunned down by an allegedly mentally ill man who had legal access to assault weapons; firearms so powerful they allowed this alienated individual to transform himself into his own self-styled Rambo.Why weren't we all taking to the streets, banging pots and pans like those women in Egypt? I wanted to open the window of my apartment in Brooklyn and yell, ""Enough is enough!"" Maybe others would join in. From our fire escapes and front stoops, we'd all be shouting and wouldn't stop until something was done. In the days following the shooting, I didn't sleep well. With a sudden start, I'd wake in the middle of the night, picturing the parents of those children. Were they able to sleep or eat or even speak? I imagined the mothers waking each day to the horror of what happened; their minds returning again and again to their children's last moments, unable to make sense of this violent, sudden loss. The pain of this national tragedy had shaken me from complacency. It was no longer enough to wring my hands and hope for better days to come. It was no longer enough to hold my kids close and feel grateful they were spared when other children, just as sweet or silly, were not. Sandy Hook had chosen love, but I was still mad as hell.With tears in my eyes, I vowed to a friend that I would dedicate part of my life to help put protections in place that would prevent another massacre of innocents. Like so many others, I searched for ways to engage politically. I signed online petitions for stricter gun regulations, wrote letters to Congress and posted editorials about gun control on social media. But as days turned into weeks, it was difficult to maintain the fervor without feeling a bit shrill, strident or even downright annoying. After a while, I got the feeling that my friends and neighbors wanted me to stop my lunatic shouting onto the street and just shut my goddamn window. Fast forward one month.The Brooklyn chapter of One Million Moms for Gun Control had organized a protest against gun violence in my neighborhood. Hundreds of mothers were to convene at a plaza just four blocks from my apartment. From the plaza, they would march across the Brooklyn Bridge to rally in front of City Hall.The founder of One Million Moms, Shannon Watts, had mobilized thousands of mothers across the country via social media. Watts, a mother of five, had shared that desire to do something after the Sandy Hook shooting. She ended up creating her own little Arab Spring from her home in Zionsville, Indiana. A neighbor who shared my perspective on gun control had invited me to the protest. Without hesitation, I accepted the invitation. But I woke up to a cold front. It was 26 degrees outside. That's pretty darn cold by New York standards. An email update for the event encouraged protesters to bundle up and wear long underwear. Upon reading it, I felt a sense of dread normally reserved for unwanted family obligations.As I showered, I imagined fighting the winds on the bridge and shivering through tedious speeches by city council members. Nothing in me wanted to go to the protest. I came up with a million reasons why I didn't need to go, not the least of which was the fact that I already lived in a state that just passed some of the strictest gun control legislation in the country. Digging through my dresser drawer in search of long johns, I wondered if the effort would fall on deaf ears, if the fight for change was futile, if it was healthier to just focus on my own family and let go of the rest.A month earlier, I had been so vocal and unwavering in my anti-gun opinions, promising to do everything in my power to help change legislation. Yet, that day an opportunity to exercise the hard-won freedom to assemble was practically thrown in my lap and I felt ambivalent. My iPhone calendar alert sounded a soft alarm: MLK Day: Protest at Cadman Plaza. The electronic reminder settled my confusion. This was a national holiday commemorating a man who worked unceasingly to create a humane society through nonviolent resistance. I had always been proud that I shared the same birthday with Dr. King. I spent much of middle school in the library reading his great orations. His words gave me both goosebumps and a moral grounding.Given the dire state of our country and planet, maybe it was no longer sufficient to simply be inspired by the words of great men. Maybe at some point in our lives, we must act.I pulled on my long johns and got dressed. Several hundred people had gathered in the plaza for the One Million Moms rally. I couldn't help thinking there should've been more, but I now understood what we were up against. We were all frogs doing the backstroke in slowly boiling water.I scanned the plaza in search of the neighbor who'd invited me. Apparently, she didn't make it. A woman handed me a hand-painted sign that said Magazines are for Reading. I found a few fellow mothers from my daughter's preschool and away we went. The blustery winds ripped right through us as we marched across the iconic bridge. Despite wool gloves and socks, our fingertips and toes went numb. But I felt happy and whole again as I held up my sign for all the camera crews and the honking horns of oncoming traffic. I was finally doing something. And something was probably better than nothing. Our hand-painted protest signs were like bright splashes of hope against the gray winter sky."

Sweetened by Coca-Cola's trademark of touching images, feel good music and sprinkling of nostalgia, the Atlanta beverage giant makes a play at convincing us that they want to be leaders in tackling the nation's weight problem. If you did not know better, it almost works.But this new campaign has a fundamental flaw. Coca-Cola and its beverage industry brethren have the dubious distinction of being the biggest contributors to the nation's obesity crisis. Over the past 30 years, 43 percent of the increase in daily calories consumed by Americans has come from sugary drinks. In a veiled mea culpa, Coca-Cola finally acknowledges the need to reverse their tendency toward super-sized portions, obscure label information and predatory marketing to children. Unfortunately, their initial steps and recommendations focused largely on physical activity are as flat as a lukewarm soda left on the counter all afternoon. In fact, in light of increased public support for regulations on their marketing practices, Coke's meager changes seem cherry-picked to provide more political cover than health impact. In 2011, the California Center for Public Advocacy, in league with leading health professionals and organizations around the nation, challenged the beverage industry to give more than lip service to the obesity crisis. Given the industry's broad product mix, their unrivaled access to the youth market and retailers, and their unparalleled influence over what Americans drink, they are ideally suited to be a part of the obesity solution. For that reason, we proposed seven concrete and meaningful steps they could take to make a real impact. Sadly, Coca-Cola's latest campaign ignores all of these.If Coca-Cola is serious about making a genuine contribution to solving the nation's obesity epidemic, here are seven steps that will put substance behind their latest campaign:  1. Stop all advertising and promotion of sugary drinks to children under the age of 16.  2. Print warnings on containers stating the link between consumption and obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.  3. Stop selling sugary drinks in parks, afterschool programs and other places frequented by children.  4. Put in large print the number of teaspoons of sugar per container.  5. Stop marketing sports drinks as healthy beverages.  6. Charge more for sugary drinks than equivalent no-calorie beverages.  7. Stop promoting the sale of sugary drinks at store entrances, checkout aisles and in store windows. For full rationale behind these steps, visit: http://tinyurl.com/7StepSolution. Given the magnitude of America's obesity crisis, Coca-Cola is right about one thing -- this is the time to come together to find real solutions. And while we congratulate Coke for publicly acknowledging the obesity epidemic, we urge them to make these seven changes. As their new ad says, we all have a role in addressing obesity. No one has a bigger part to play than the beverage industry -- not simply by encouraging American's to exercise more but also by changing their own corrosive marketing practices."

Prince William's pregnant wife Catherine left a London hospital four days after she was admitted for treatment for acute morning sickness, an AFP photographer said.AFP PHOTO/Leon Neal (Photo credit should read LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbf571f00002c0021589c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kate Middleton's acute morning sickness was brought to the public eye when she was checked into a hospital in December, and a report has now surfaced that she's turning to hypnotherapy as a way to overcome her negative associations with food, an Australian tabloid is reporting. An old friend of the Duchess of Cambridge reportedly told New Idea magazine that Kate, who is due in July, is still having a hard time finding food appealing at this point in her pregnancy. The friend went on to tell New Idea that the hypnotherapy aims to remove negative thoughts she has toward food and replace them with ""cravings for healthy, nutritious food."" Though morning sickness is common, Duchess Kate's acute morning sickness (also known as hyperemesis gravidarum) is rare and much more severe. It's estimated that 70 to 80 percent of women experience morning sickness, while just one to two percent of women get hyperemesis gravidarum. Symptoms of acute morning sickness involve more than just an upset stomach and may include an extreme and persistent feeling of nausea, along with vomiting, which can lead to dehydration. Whether Kate is actually undergoing hypnosis is up for debate, given the source of the report. But the claim raises questions of whether hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective as a treatment for women suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.Medical studies do not offer conclusive evidence. In 2010, researchers at Queen's University of Belfast in Belfast, Northern Ireland, completed an examination of six different studies on hypnotherapy and acute morning sickness and found encouraging results for its use as a treatment. However, the researchers concluded that the quality of evidence was not sufficient to establish whether hypnosis is truly effective. According to Dr. Tony Chon with the Mayo Clinic's Complimentary and Integrative Medicine Program, studies on hypnotherapy's effectiveness have shown mixed results. However, he told The Huffington Post that enough anecdotal evidence exists to suggest that the method can be a help to women, especially when so few treatment options exist for acute morning sickness. ""There's a lot of misconceptions about hypnosis, where everything is in dark room and someone's going to be swinging a clock in your face and youre going to be barking like a dog,"" Chon said to HuffPost.Instead, he explained, the practice should relax the mind, making the subject more open and receptive to positive suggestions. Since morning sickness conditions the brain to associate food with nausea, hypnotherapy could possibly recondition that response, according to Chon.""When someone is going through a trance with hypnosis, then you're kind of trying to change the way someone thinks about food,"" he said. ""Rather than saying you're going to get nauseaus, you're saying the food that you see from this point on is going to be very nutritious, it's going to be good tasting, it's going to lead to a positive pregnancy.""  According to the National Institutes of Health, other treatments for acute morning sickness include eating small, frequent meals and eating dry foods, like crackers. Severe cases might call for intravenous (IV) therapy, and medication might be used when the vomiting is enough to present a potential risk to the mother or her unborn baby. "

Lenin's body is still a Red Square attraction despite the fall of the Soviet Union and Mao's brittle carapace brings in Tianeman hordes. The newest member of this fraternity of relics is Kim Jong-Il, North Korea's dictator and champion golfer who has been laid out in a state mausoleum.Last week, the first group of western tourists entered Kim's unliving room and the Times of London wrangled an interview with one of the tourists, who said the North Korean's had ""done a good job"" preserving their now definitely fearless leader. Unfortunately, the opening of this peculiar attraction -- certainly intended as a tribute despite being a geo-political rubbernecker's dream -- doesn't mean that travel to North Korea is likely to get any easier any time soon. Though several tour companies, including Koryo Tours, offer trips into the country, independent travel doesn't appear to be a looming possibility. The issue appears to be the desire of the North Korean government to keep its citizens from interacting with the outside world.As the Los Angeles Times recently reported, tourists are now allowed to bring phones into the country but are still banned from making local calls. Last year a bus driver made international headlines when he accidentally turned off a government planned route, offering the traveling press core a quick glimpse of one of Pyongyang's impoverished neighborhoods.When the country does open more, it is likely that Kim will remain the starring attraction. As HuffPost Travel blogger Richard Bangs experienced on his recent trip to the Hermit Kingdom, local guides have an encyclopedic knowledge of Kim's life and are eager to point out important places like where he was born, a ""birth foretold by a swallow and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow across the sky.""Other Kim-centric attractions include the dictator's private residences and where he and his father sermonized together. This means that to the xenophobic North Korean government, tourists have become things looking at Kim Jong-Il. "

It's time to take a time out from those messy bachelor habits and get in the organized zone! In order to get and stay organize, bachelors should think of their pads as various zones (like in football) in order to divide and conquer. Below are essential tips needed for each zone of a bachelor's apartment.The Entry Zone The first space when you walk in the door is most essential to keeping a pad organized. Let's face it, shoes are always hard to keep track of and end up being cluttered throughout your place. By investing in a shoe rack you not only keep all your shoes in the same space you remind yourself to take your shoes off right when entering your pad. The Work Zone  Get with the times bachelors! Make your work zone tech-savy in order to be clutter-free. One way to keep your information organized is by managing your contacts in your smart phone -- keeping the data up-to-date and deleting contacts that are no longer needed. Another tech tip is to buy an external hard drive and back up all of the files on your computer on it so that you never lose any important information. Back up and sync your data a couple of times a week in order to prevent total data loss in case you lose your phone or your computer crashes.The Chow Zone  Stay healthy and save money by eating in most days of the week. Each week, create a simple meal plan, write up a shopping list (or use a handy app, like Grocery iQ, on your phone so you have it with you at all times) and shop weekly. Your menu doesn't have to be complicated and can simply rotate through five to 10 favorite meals. Having a list ensures you have what you need and keeps you from straying to junk food. For easy meal prep, keep your freezer, refrigerator and pantry stocked with ""staples"" (ground beef/turkey, chicken, pork chops, pasta, rice, beans, vegetables, fruits, etc.) that will allow you to make a variety of dishes.The Thread Zone  Establish a weekly laundry day as a way to avoid having to wear something inappropriate to work or another event because nothing is clean. Place a sorting hamper in the bathroom or bedroom (wherever you typically get undressed) so you can sort your lights and darks as you take them off. Having a laundry hamper provides a place for the dirty clothes and keeps them off the floor, which women find unattractive! When laundry day comes, you're already sorted and are ready to wash.The End Zone  A bachelor's favorite space is his living room, therefore it is the most prone to getting cluttered. One way a bachelor can keep his living room tidy is by purchasing a storage ottoman. The ottoman allows the bachelor to store items that tend to cause clutter such as blankets, remotes, magazines, etc. The ottoman also is a great piece of furniture that allows a bachelor to kick his feet up while watching a game!"

Deen's husband, Michael Groover, is down 60 pounds, according to People, while eldest son Jamie has shed 45 and Bobby has lost 33. For the full story on her family, click over to People.com.While Deen's weight loss has slowed (she had lost 30 pounds in June), she's stayed on track thanks to ""Moderation, moderation, moderation,"" she told the magazine.Her diagnosis came with a hefty dose of controversy, as she revealed she had diabetes at the same time as announcing a new partnership with Novo Nordisk, the maker of a diabetes drug, The Atlantic reported. She had also hidden the condition for some time, while continuing to promote her notoriously butter-laden recipes, according to the AP.But she seems to be on the right track, especially if her family is on board. Social support -- whether it's from family members or even close friends -- can be the key to lasting weight loss. Shedding pounds as a team affords people the opportunity to swap healthy recipes, discuss their progress and exercise with a like-minded buddy who can help maintain accountability, according to the American Psychological Association. Even virtual social support -- via Twitter, for example -- can help people lose the weight and keep it off, according to a recent study.Of course, a few small changes to her cooking repertoire can't hurt, either.

But, sometimes, the juxtaposition of place, time and melody combines and hits a target deep inside the heart triggering explosive thoughts.Here in Belgrade, Americans are not uniformly welcomed. The vestiges of the United Nations-sanctioned bombing by NATO forces during the Kosovo War remain visible here, even as the invisible marks of fierce nationalism and international condemnation lie hidden in Serbians' psyche just beneath the surface of daily life. As a visitor here, I am keenly aware of this history and the events that occurred in my lifetime.So it was with a sense of the surreal that I listened to the music projected over the loudspeakers in my hotel's lobby. Not just any piano music, but very specifically, one of the most patriotic contemporary American songs: Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA."" Seriously. Now, this particular song caught national attention in 1984, and then gained in popularity and prominence during the Gulf War, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and most recently with the success of the American raid that resulted in Osama bin Laden's death in 2011. I know it best from hometown rodeos in Colorado and Wyoming. So strong are my associations with this particular melody and lyrics that the experience of hearing it is inextricably linked to mental images of a rodeo queen galloping with the American flag streaming above her rhinestone-studded cowboy-hatted head.This is why I was so utterly taken aback when the sedate piano version of ""God Bless the USA"" wafted through the air here in Belgrade. At first, I thought there had to a live pianist -- an ex-pat American, no doubt -- who slipped in a little hometown melody for the sake of nostalgia and remembrance. But, no, the waiter informed me. The song, like all the others before and after, was simply on a playlist downloaded from ""somewhere"" and played here everyday. How weird, how very, very weird.Weird, because this is a song of American patriotism playing in a country that provided some of the most horrifying examples of late 20th-century nationalism and paid for it, in part, with justice meted out by American fliers. This is a righteous song for those who pledge allegiance to the USA. It is a song of national pride, which comes close to nationalism, and therein lies the complexity and nuance.There's a fine line between constructive pride of country, culture and history, and the devastating metastatic outgrowth of a nationalism that perpetrates genocide. Patriotic songs surface on both sides of that line, and such stirrings in the breast of patriots cross national boundaries and require vigilance among us all.So what does it mean for an American to listen to this song in the Serbian capital? What does it signify that the Serbian staff hum the melody daily yet are ignorant of the lyrics? And, could it be that this song resonated in the minds of servicemen who were proud to be American as they participated in the NATO bombing of Belgrade and put their lives at risk to protect the rights of others? I wonder about these questions as I silently sing the lyrics.I am proud to be American, here and now, gazing at buildings that still bear witness both to those who fought against the poison of nationalism and those who suffered beyond description during the genocide. It's a heavy thing to remember and even more important that we never forget."
9,HOME & LIVING,How to Organize Your Bedside Table for Better Sleep,"Brooks Palmer, Contributor
De-cluttering expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bedside-table-organization_us_5b9cbf83e4b03a1dcc817521,Our well-being is dependent on how well we rest each night.,2013-01-23,"Twin beds with table lamps lighted up in a high class, dimly-lit hotel room",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbf83240000300094cdb5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I have spent the past 12 years helping clients let go of unnecessary items in their homes, offices and lives -- one area at a time. This post focuses on cutting back on the clutter from your bedside.I've worked with a lot of people on the space next to their bed, and the feedback they gave me is that it truly helps them sleep better at night. This is my process:1. Excavate. Take everything off of and out of your bedside table. Also remove anything from off the floor next to the bed, and anything under your bed. Place everything on top of your bed. If you can remove the table or cabinet next to the bed, do so. Take a few minutes to focus on the empty space that's left. Sometimes a space vibrates after you remove the things in it, like it comes back to life. Notice the calm it produces in your body and mind.Stand over your bed and survey all your stuff. We absorb what's in our space. You have been taking all this stuff with you when you go to sleep at night. It makes it hard to get good sleep. Our well-being is dependent on how well we rest each night.2. Carefully choose what soothes you. You're going to go through each thing on the bed and see if it supports a restful night's sleep or not. Pick up the first thing and ask, ""Does this make me feel peaceful or not? Does this relax or agitate my mind? Does this make me want to lie down on my bed right now and close my eyes, or does this worry or adrenalize me?""Our sleeping life is the antithesis of our waking life. What supports one doesn't support the other. You want to remove what keeps you awake. You want to invite in with pampers and soothes. Toss what you no longer want into the trash bags, and put back things that belong in another part of the house.Put back the nightstand next to your bed with nothing on it. Lay down on your bed, close your eyes and feel the stand. Ask yourself, ""Do I like the stand? Does it feel like we are friends? Does this support my sleep or not?"" If not, let it go. You may not have something to replace it with, but you're better off having the empty supportive space.I'm tempted to tell you what not to put by your bedside based on clients that I've worked with, but you know best what supports you. 3. What to put back. Take a look at the remaining items on your bed. You're going to pick the ones you want to take to sleep with you at night. The fewer the items the better. If you like to read before you go to sleep, pick one or two books that you most want to read. I had a client who had multitudes of moisturizing creams. Looking at them as a whole made her anxious. So we chose the few she would buy if she were shopping at a spa store. What basic essentials are going to make you melt into your bed?Make sure not to layer or stack things. We feel more peaceful when things are unobstructed and there is space between things.Don't put anything you're keeping on the floor next to the bed.Leave the space under your bed open. Things under the bed have a way of distracting us while we sleep. It's nice to have the support of the open space.Please write and tell me your experiences clearing your bedside clutter; it helps inspire people when you share.Brooks Palmer is the author of Clutter Busting: Letting Go of What's Holding You Back (New World Library, 2009) and Clutter Busting Your Life: Clearing Physical and Emotional Clutter to Reconnect With Yourself and Others (New World Library, 2012).
