0,POLITICS,Paul LePage Endorses Donald Trump Just A Week After Trashing Him,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-lepage-donald-trump_us_56d20183e4b0bf0dab3256d6,He reportedly urged other Republicans to write an open letter disavowing the businessman.,2016-02-27,Maine Gov. Paul LePage quickly backed down in his opposition to Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d2038f1e00008700702eed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) apparently didn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump. Days after pushing his fellow GOP governors to speak out against Trump, he's endorsed the Republican presidential frontrunner.During a meeting of Republican governors last weekend, LePage said the real estate mogul would harm the party and urged those present to write an ""open letter"" to the American people distancing themselves from Trump, The New York Times reported. The plan, according to the Times, went nowhere.But less than a week after his plea, LePage completely reversed his position and publicly endorsed Trump.“I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular, so I think I should support him since we’re one of the same cloth,” he told radio host Howie Carr on Friday.LePage has tried to fashion himself as a tough-talking governor of sorts. In 2011, he ordered a mural in Maine's Department of Labor removed because he didn't like it and last month he blamed the state's heroin crisis on men with names like ""D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty,"" who he claimed were selling the drugs in the state and impregnating white women. LePage later apologized for the comment. His endorsement of Trump came the same day as that of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who frequently criticized Trump when he was running against him."
1,POLITICS,Here's What Congress Is Doing About Lead Pipes In Flint And Elsewhere,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-flint_us_56d0a37be4b0871f60eb4ab6,Don't expect the ones in your community to come out of the ground anytime soon.,2016-02-27,Rep. Brenda Lawrence is a fan of new legislation to help cities like Flint.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Congress might soon take action to help cities avoid another water lead poisoning crisis like the one in Flint, Michigan.""We make certain promises to people in this country: clean water, safe food and clean air,"" Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. ""We are now in the Senate -- and we'll be doing it in the House -- passing funding and resources so that we can fix our water infrastructure in America,"" Lawrence said.Democrats originally pushed for $600 million of direct federal assistance to Flint, mostly for grants to help the beleaguered city of nearly 100,000 replace its lead pipes. Republicans resisted the proposal, with some tarring it as an ""earmark"" since it directed funds only to one community. The resulting bipartisan compromise would help any state -- not just Michigan -- access loans to deal with water emergencies and infrastructure upgrades.Congress now has a big opportunity to do something about lead. People might be more aware of the problem of water lead than ever -- 58 percent of Americans surveyed by HuffPost/YouGov in January said they had been following the Flint water crisis at least somewhat closely. A search of national polling archives suggests that, prior to Flint, little effort had been made to measure awareness of the problem.Roughly 10 million American homes and buildings get water from service lines that are at least partly made of lead, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Federal law requires public water systems to treat the water so it won't corrode pipes, but treatment mistakes in any locale with lead pipes could cause a Flint-style crisis. ""The one good thing that can come out of this is that more people can become cognizant of water lead as a source of exposure,"" historian Werner Troesken said. Troesken's 2006 book The Great Lead Water Pipe Disaster details case studies of water lead poisoning dating to the 1800s, when many cities began using lead pipes for water distribution. A single glass of water in some towns at the turn of the century could contain as much lead as a black market abortion pill. But lead poisoning symptoms can be so varied and subtle -- causing not just miscarriages, but also such generic problems as high blood pressure and constipation -- that doctors often struggled to recognize the source of their patients' problems. Public health officials focused more on infectious diseases like cholera, and doctors who recognized the water lead problem had a hard time convincing the broader medical community. Today, thanks partly to epidemiologists studying lead's effects at the population level, lead is recognized as completely unsafe, especially for children, for whom it can cause permanent brain damage and behavioral problems. Epidemiologists regard lead paint and dust as the primary source of poisoning, but Troesken's current research suggests children who grow up in cities with corrosive water supplies and lead pipes are basically less likely to succeed in life. The approach nationally continues to be to leave the pipes in the ground, since digging them up would be expensive. And if water is treated with anti-corrosion chemicals, it can form a barrier that coats the interior of lead pipes and prevents lead particles from heading toward people's faucets. Federal law requires public water departments to keep an eye on lead levels in water sampled from people's homes to make sure the corrosion control is holding up. It's a wishful strategy -- the Flint water crisis showed a weakness in the regulation when Flint officials, apparently deliberately, sampled water from homes that didn't have lead service lines, thereby masking the problem as it emerged.The legislation crafted in the U.S. Senate doesn't address the regulation, though it does encourage the EPA to step in and notify the public if local water authorities are dropping the ball. Instead, it provides $100 million to help states apply for subsidized loans in the event of a Flint-like emergency, and $70 million in credit subsidies for states to get loans to help pay for water infrastructure upgrades, such as replacing lead pipes. ""The media’s attention to Flint has put a spotlight on the crisis we face across the nation due to a failure to address aging water infrastructure,"" Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said in a statement this week. Clean water advocacy groups think the bill is good, but not great. They prefer legislation introduced by Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) that would toughen monitoring of water lead levels and the regulations triggering lead pipe removal. “The Senate aid package for Flint is an important start but not nearly enough to help the city deal with the immediate and long term health impacts of this crisis,"" the League of Conservation Voters' Madeleine Foote said in a statement about the plan for loan assistance. ""There are many more Flints across the country, and we must make the commitment to seriously invest in our critical water infrastructure and finally address systemic injustices; all Americans deserve access to clean air and water.” The Senate bill has been held up by a handful of Republicans, though Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), one of its chief architects, has said she's optimistic the bill will get a vote next week. The EPA is in the process of revising the Safe Drinking Water Act regulation that deals with the way public water systems respond to high lead levels. An agency working group recently made recommendations that a coalition of activists -- including Dr. Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech engineering professor who helped blow the whistle in Flint -- have said won't do enough to clamp down on shoddy water testing by utilities and to get rid of lead pipes across the country. Paul Schwartz, a water policy expert at Water Alliance, welcomed the Senate bill but said lawmakers should be looking at current water regulations.""They're still at the margins of fixing the problem, but not really at the heart of what the major problems are in Flint and across the water utility systems in the United States,"" Schwartz said."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by a significant margin in Saturday's primary in South Carolina.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d0d2121e0000230070ede4.jpeg?ops=crop_0_145_3000_1891%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- As Hillary Clinton heads into Saturday's Democratic presidential primary, she is not taking her more-than-comfortable lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the state polls for granted. Clinton, her husband Bill and her daughter Chelsea have appeared at dozens of events around the state, as have African-American Democratic political leaders like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) who have endorsed her bid for the nomination. Sanders, in contrast, wasn’t in South Carolina Thursday, and was only scheduled to hold two rallies in the state Friday afternoon and evening. Instead, the senator has invested time in states with primaries and caucuses scheduled for next month, such as Oklahoma, and he will be in Texas and Minnesota Saturday evening -- places where he needs to rack up delegates to still have a shot at beating Clinton. If Clinton wins on Saturday, as she is expected to, it will be in large part a result of what her team learned from 2008. Eight years ago, then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois dominated among African-American voters, who make up a majority of the primary electorate here, while also picking up roughly 25 percent of the white vote. Clinton held a lead among black voters for months ahead of that primary and had high-profile endorsements from black officials. But Obama’s campaign out-organized her team on the ground, convincing many skeptical voters that he was, in fact, a viable candidate following his win in the Iowa caucus.Bill Clinton also managed to alienate some in the state during that primary when he appeared to dismiss Obama’s victory in South Carolina by noting that Jesse Jackson, an African-American, had twice won the state. This time around, the former President Clinton has been visible at a number of get-out-the-vote events and rallies for his wife, but has stayed on message.During a surprise stop Friday morning at Drip, a Columbia coffee shop, Bill Clinton told The Huffington Post that he is confident his wife will win Saturday. “All the people who were for her then are helping her now,"" he said, ""and then she’s got a lot of people who supported President Obama.” Clinton’s campaign has been criticized this election for lacking a coherent message, a criticism she also faced in 2008. Obama’s message of hope and change proved to be more appealing than Clinton’s emphasis on her experience and qualifications. But in South Carolina this year, Clinton has found a theme and stuck with it: She’s a fighter who will help others break down barriers to opportunity. On Thursday, Clinton spoke at a Baptist church in Florence alongside Booker. The crowd was at capacity, forcing a fire marshal to bar another 50 people who showed up from entering -- including this reporter. But dozens stuck around to listen to Booker and Clinton over speakers piped outside. “I don’t know if there’s a politician in America with more grit and determination and resilience than her,” Booker said. “Because every step of the way she was attacked, she was backstabbed, she was pulled back, she was tripped up, but she kept rising to better levels of service every single time.""We know that there’s been no step along this journey to justice that hasn’t been fought with people trying to push you back,” he continued. South Carolina faced two racially fraught tragedies last year. Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, was killed by a white police officer in April; in June, a mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel church in Charleston left nine people dead. Clinton advocated for racial justice and healing after those events, and held a forum Tuesday with mothers of unarmed young blacks who have been killed in high-profile acts of brutality. Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton; Sandra Bland's mother, Geneva Reed-Veal; Maria Hamilton, the mother of Dontre Hamilton; Lucy McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis and Eric Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, attended.Clinton's more personal approach seems to be working.“She’s more in the trenches compared to what she was doing before,” said Tatt Enhead, a 43-year-old Methodist preacher, who was listening outside of the church in Florence. “Before, she talked about things that pertained to the community, but you’re seeing her much more in the community than in previous times.” Clinton and her supporters have also tried to cast doubt on Sanders’ authenticity as an advocate for racial justice and criminal justice reform. Booker suggested, at a Thursday event at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, that Sanders had come to such issues too late. “Hillary was talking about these issues before it was election time,"" he said. ""She was in the trenches fighting for the things I care about, not just today and not just yesterday."" Sanders supporters would respond by noting that the senator was arrested protesting segregation in Chicago in 1963 and attended the historic March on Washington that year. Democrats voting for Clinton told HuffPost they appreciate that Clinton honors the achievements Obama has made in office while she campaigns. To hammer that message home, Priorities USA, a super PAC backing Clinton, is running radio ads here featuring former Attorney General Eric Holder's endorsement of Clinton, emphasizing that Obama chose Holder to defend voting rights and investigate police misconduct. Other ads for Clinton similarly emphasize her connection to Obama. In Florence, Darlean Faust-Sellers said that while she was still not a fan of Bill Clinton's 2008 remarks about Obama, she was even more displeased with Sanders suggestion in 2011 that another Democrat should challenge his re-election bid. “I just thought it was unprofessional for [Sanders] to be running a campaign for the Democratic Party and he chose to talk against President Obama,” she said. “Who does that?"" Clinton, she said, has earned the support of South Carolina voters: ""Hillary has status because she’s been there through the thick and the thin; she’s been doing things to prove herself worthy."" Clinton drew big applause at a forum in North Charleston Thursday evening when she boasted that she is “a proud Democrat ” -- an implicit critique of Sanders, an independent who has distanced himself from the Democratic Party. Clinton emphasized the importance of having a strong party leader at the top of the ticket in November. “I support Democrats, and I want to help elect Democratic senators, especially after this latest behavior by the Republicans in the Senate to deny the president the right to send a Supreme Court nominee to the Senate -- that has just gone way too far,” she said. “This has to be a priority. I will be the head of the Democratic Party and I take that seriously, and I want to help South Carolina field more Democrats at the local and state level.”Charnita Mack, a 22-year-old journalism student at the University of South Carolina, told HuffPost Thursday that she was voting for Clinton because she likes her positions on early childhood education and gun safety. She predicted Clinton would win by a comfortable margin Saturday.“She has a lot of African-American support, mainly because of how much she supports Obama,” Mack said. “We want somebody we feel like we can trust when Obama leaves.” "

In one area, they ate all the leaves from blackberry stems but left the prickly bramble.It is not the first time goats have been used as gasoline-free lawn-mowers. They have been used at Alphabet Inc's headquarters in Mountain View, California, and at the Historic Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.Keever did say that Salem is not ruling out using goats in the future for certain landscaping projects, such as maintaining steep hills.(Reporting by Eric M.

Moscow's intervention effectively destroyed the hope his enemies have maintained for five years -- encouraged by Arab and Western states -- to topple him by force.The agreement is the first of its kind to be attempted in four years and, if it holds, would be the most successful truce of the war so far.But there are weak spots in a fragile deal which has not been directly signed by the Syrian warring parties and is less binding than a formal ceasefire. Importantly, it does not cover powerful jihadist groups such as Islamic State and the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's branch inSyria.""Let's pray that this works because frankly this is the best opportunity we can imagine theSyrian people has had for the last five years in order to see something better and hopefully something related to peace,"" U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said at a midnight news conference in Geneva.He said he expected occasional breaches of the agreement but called on the parties to show restraint and curb escalation.Several insurgents in the western and northern part of the country said early on Saturday that it was mainly quiet so far.Nevertheless, Fares Bayoush, head of the Fursan al-Haqq rebel group which fights under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, told Reuters that continuing violations could lead to the ""collapse of the agreement"".""There are areas where the bombardment has stopped but there are areas where there are violations by the regime such as Kafr Zeita in Hama, via targeting with artillery, and likewise in Morek in northern Hama countryside.""REPORTS OF VIOLENCEIn early reports of violence, a Syrian rebel group in the northwest said three of its fighters had been killed while repelling an attack from government ground forces a few hours after the plan came into effect. Its spokesman called it a breach of the agreement; the Syrian military could not be reached immediately for comment.Syria's state media said at least two people were killed and several wounded when a car bomb exploded at the entrance of Salamiya, a town east of Hama city and a frontline between government forces and Islamic State group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors the conflict said it was carried out by Islamic State.The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said Islamic State fighters had attacked Tal Abyad, a town near the Turkish border.Damascus and Moscow say they will respect the agreement but continue to fight the Nusra Front and Islamic State. Other rebels seen as moderates by the West say they fear this will be used to justify attacks on them.Russia's defense ministry said it would suspend air strikes in a ""green zone"" -- defined as those parts of Syria held by groups that have accepted the cessation -- and make no flights at all on Saturday.""Given the entry into force of the U.N. Security Council resolution that supports the Russian-American agreements on a ceasefire, and to avoid any possible mistakes when carrying out strikes, Russian military planes, including long-range aviation, are not carrying out any flights over Syrian territory on Feb. 27,"" the defense ministry said.Sergei Rudskoi, a lieutenant-general in the Russian air force, told a news briefing that Moscow had sent the United States a list of 6,111 fighters who had agreed to the ceasefire deal and 74 populated areas which should not be bombed.Nusra Front, one of Syria's most powerful Islamist rebel groups, often operates close to other groups, making it potentially difficult to prove whether strikes have targeted it. On Friday, Nusra urged insurgents to intensify their attacks on Assad and his allies.""THERE IS CALM""A rebel fighter said government forces briefly fired artillery at a village in Aleppo province, which he said was under the control of the Levant Front, another group under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army which has backed the truce.Nevertheless he said the frontline was quieter than before the agreement took effect.""There is calm. Yesterday at this time there were fierce battles. It is certainly strange, but the people are almost certain that the regime will breach the truce on the grounds of hitting Nusra. There is the sound of helicopters from the early morning,"" he told Reuters earlier on Saturday.Fighting raged across much of western Syria right up until the cessation came into effect but there was calm in many parts of the country shortly after midnight, the Observatory said.""In Damascus and its countryside ... for the first time in years, calm prevails,"" Observatory director Rami Abdulrahman said. ""In Latakia, calm, and at the Hmeimim air base there is no plane activity,"" he said, referring to the Latakia base where Russia's warplanes operate.Some gunfire had been heard shortly after midnight in the northern city of Aleppo, and there were some blasts heard in northern Homs province, but it was not clear what had caused them, Abdulrahman said.After years in which any action by the United Nations Security Council was blocked by Moscow, Russia's intervention has opened a path for multilateral diplomacy while undermining the long-standing Western demand that Assad leave power.The Security Council unanimously demanded late on Friday that all parties to the conflict comply with terms of the plan. De Mistura said he intends to restart peace talks on March 7, provided the halt in fighting largely holds.U.N.-backed peace talks, the first in two years and the first to include delegations from Damascus and the rebels, collapsed earlier this month before they began, with the rebels saying they could not negotiate while they were being bombed.The government, backed by Russian air strikes, has dramatically advanced in recent weeks, moving close to encircling Aleppo, Syria's biggest city before the war, and threatening to seal the Turkish border that has served as the main lifeline for rebel-held areas.Washington said it was time for Russia to show it was serious about halting fighting by honoring a commitment not to strike Syrian groups that are part of the moderate opposition.(Reporting by John Davison, Mariam Karouny and Tom Perry in Beirut, Louis Charbonneau and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations in New York, Tom Miles and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva and Andrew Osborn in Moscow; Writing by Mariam Karouny and Peter Graff)"

And anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock for the past few decades knows there aren’t many big Latino-centric movies. In fact, even when movies are about real Latinos, or other people of color, studios often go ahead and just cast white people anyway.And the problem isn't just onscreen. A Columbia University study of the 10 highest-grossing movies domestically between 2010 and 2013 found that Latinos made up only 6 percent of writers, 2.3 percent of directors and 2.2 percent of producers.While lack of diversity in Hollywood has been getting a lot of attention recently with the #OscarsSoWhite movement, the Brown Ribbon Campaign is an effort to make people realize that the issue is more comprehensive than white versus black.The National Hispanic Media Coalition promoted the campaign at their Impact Awards Gala, which honors positive media portrayals of Latinos, on Friday.""The issue of diversity in entertainment can no longer be a black--white dialogue,"" Alex Nogales, president of the NHMC, said in a statement. ""It has to include Latinos, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, and women. Every community has its creatives and we gather at the Impact Awards to honor ours and inspire more.”"

Kamisher-Koch argued at a meeting of administrators, students and faculty that beverages like Red Bull and 5-Hour energy promote a “culture of stress” and encourage bad academic habits.Dan Detora, executive director of dining hall services, told NBC that consuming energy drinks can have potentially serious health consequences. College officials also told the outlet the drinks have been linked to unsafe behavior like alcohol abuse and ""high-risk sexual activity."" At least two students told The Middlebury Campus that this link also worries them. But it’s very possible administrators -- and these students -- are confusing causation with correlation. While multiple studies link energy drinks to “risky behavior,” there’s little evidence that these drinks cause people to engage in high-risk behavior. It could simply be that students drawn to risky behaviors are also drawn to energy drinks.""It appears the kids who are heavily into drinking energy drinks are more likely to be the ones who are inclined toward taking risks,” Kathleen Miller, an addiction researcher who led a 2008 study on the subject, told The New York Times.And some students are questioning the decision.""There are more important things for them to address,"" Arnav Adhikari, a senior who works at a cafe on campus, told NBC News. ""And what do energy drinks have to do with sexual activity?""Adhikari also suggested the claims of energy drinks being too unhealthy were a bit hypocritical, since Dining Services still sells plenty of fried food.In any case, energy drinks aren’t banned altogether. Students are still allowed to drink them -- they just have to buy them somewhere else."

But without Scalia, it appears the new reality at the high court was too big a gamble for the company to continue with the litigation.""Growing political uncertainties due to recent events within the Supreme Court and increased likelihood for unfavorable outcomes for business involved in class action suits have changed Dow’s risk assessment of the situation,"" the company said in a statement.Dow said a case the Supreme Court heard last year but hasn't yet decided, Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo, was the reason its own case was still on hold at the court. Both cases present common questions of law that may limit class-action liability -- an area where the Supreme Court of late has been friendly to business interests.Stunningly, Dow's statement singled out two major cases in which Scalia wrote the majority opinions -- 2011's Wal-Mart v. Dukes and 2013's Comcast v. Behrend -- essentially conceding that, without Scalia, the company no longer had any prospects of winning. Both of those cases were decided 5 to 4, with conservatives ruling for the corporations.Given the new eight-justice court, Dow called its decision to end the litigation ""the right decision for the company and our shareholders."" As is usual with settlements, the company maintained its innocence.""While Dow is settling this case, it continues to strongly believe that it was not part of any conspiracy and the judgment was fundamentally flawed as a matter of class action law,"" the company said.A jury in 2013 had found Dow Chemical liable in a price-fixing scheme with four other companies for chemicals used to produce urethane, a compound used in foam upholstery for furniture and plastic walls in refrigerators, according to Bloomberg. About 2,400 businesses that bought the chemicals from Dow joined in a class action against the industrial giant.Friday's settlement is just another example of the shifting landscape at the Supreme Court -- and why it matters who fills the now-vacant seat."

The president has made no secret of his desire to shut down Camp Delta, the internment facility for jihadists, which is housed on the base. Closing down ""Gitmo,"" as the interment facility is typically referred to, figured prominently in President Obama's election campaigns in both 2008 and 2012. The Obama White House has repeatedly asserted that the existence of the internment facilities at Gitmo is a ""powerful recruiting tool"" for jihadist organizations and should be closed. The U.S. Congress has repeatedly stymied these plans, refusing to appropriate money for the closure of Gitmo, and even going so far as to pass legislation specifically requiring Congressional approval for the transfer of any detainees from Gitmo. The president has one other alternative for closing down Gitmo, he can issue an executive order unilaterally withdrawing the U.S. from the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934, thus rescinding America's right to operate a naval base at Guantanamo Bay and, by extension, forcing the closure of the facility and any of the detention camps housed there. In recent weeks there has been a spate of media reports asserting that the White House may in fact be considering such an action. Additionally, Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz, during the Republican presidential debate sponsored by CNN on December 15, warned that, ""I fear that by the end of this year, President Obama plans to give the Guantanamo Naval Base back to Cuba."" Senator Cruz repeated his allegation at a campaign rally in Reno, Nevada, on February 22. Senator Marco Rubio, another Republican contender for the nomination, made the same allegations at a rally in Las Vegas on February 21.To be fair to the Obama White House, it has not given any indication that it is in fact even considering the option of returning Gitmo to Havana. Responding to press reports suggesting that such an action was under discussion, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated clearly that, ""The naval base is not something that we believe should be closed."" Secretary of State John Kerry echoed similar comments when he declared that returning the base to Cuba ""was not part of the discussion on our side."" Moreover, unilaterally returning the base to Cuban sovereignty during a presidential election year would have far reaching consequences for Democrat candidates for political office. If the Obama White House were to unilaterally give back the naval base to Havana, it would most likely come in the period following the November election. The question we need to ask is, does President Obama have the constitutional authority to unilaterally return the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base back to Cuba? The surprising answer is yes.The United States acquired the right to maintain a naval base at Guantanamo Bay pursuant to the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations that the two countries signed in 1903. The treaty stipulated that the newly created Republic of Cuba would lease to the United States land surrounding Guantanamo Bay for the purpose of establishing a coaling and naval station for as long as necessary. The treaty acknowledged that Cuba retained ""ultimate sovereignty"" on the land being leased, but that the United States could ""exercise complete jurisdiction and control."" The 1903 treaty was subsequently abrogated and replaced by the 1934 Cuban-American Treaty of Relations. In that treaty, the government of Cuba again confirmed the lease of land at Guantanamo Bay to the United States for the purpose of a naval base unless the agreement was modified or abrogated by mutual consent of the two parties or the base was abandoned by the U.S. The treaty also increased the rent for the leased land from $2,000 a year, payable in gold coins, to $4,085 a year, payable in cash. That same rent has continued to this day.  Map of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.The base itself covers approximately 45 square miles of land and water at Guantanamo Bay on the southeast corner of the island of Cuba. The shorthand term ""Gitmo"" evolved from the airfield designation code GTMO used by the U.S military. The facility is the oldest overseas naval base still operated by the United States and the only base it operates in a communist country. The facility houses approximately 9,500 sailors and marines. In January 2002, the United States established a military prison within the confines of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to, according to then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, ""house extraordinarily dangerous people, to interrogate detainees, and to prosecute detainees for war crimes."" At its peak, the detention facility held 670 individuals. Since then, as of February 2016, the number of detainees has been reduced to 91. Of those 91, 35 are eligible to be transferred to other countries, 10 are awaiting trial by military courts, and 46 are still being evaluated. A total of 783 individuals have been detained at the camp since it was established. 532 prisoners were released during the Bush Administration and the Obama Administration has released 151. There have been nine detainees that have died from either natural causes or suicide. It currently costs the United States approximately four million dollars per year to house each prisoner. According to the Director of National Intelligence, as of July 15, 2015, approximately 30 percent of the inmates released have either been confirmed or are believed to have reengaged in ""combatant activity.""In addition to the main facility, nicknamed Camp Delta, which consists of six separate detention facilities numbered 1 to 6, there are a number of smaller facilities at the base. These include Camp 7, used to house high security detainees formerly held by the CIA in overseas ""black sites"" under the extraordinary rendition program, Camp Echo, where detainees are held prior to appearing before the Military Commissions, and Camp No, a ""black site"" about a mile outside the main camp perimeter where interrogations were conducted. There is also a small site, nicknamed ""Penny Lane,"" where inmates that the CIA was attempting to recruit as double agents to spy on al-Qaeda were held. Detainees in the camp have accused the United States of abuse and torture. In January 2009, Susan J. Crawford, who had been appointed on February 7, 2007, to the Convening Authority for the Guantanamo Military Commissions by the Bush administration, issued a report concluding that there was at least one instance where the torture of a detainee had occurred. Ms. Crawford is an American lawyer who had previously served as the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.President Barack Obama issued Executive Order No. 13492 on January 22, 2009, two days after taking the Oath of Office, suspending the proceedings of the Guantanamo military commission for 120 days and ordering the shutdown of that facility by year end. A U.S. military judge at Guantanamo rejected that request. The United States Senate subsequently passed an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009, on May 20, by a 90-6 vote to block funds required for the transfer or release of prisoners held at the detention camp. The House followed suit and the provision was enacted on June 24, 2009.  Newly arrived detainees at the Guntanamo Bay naval base, January 2002 President Obama issued a presidential memorandum on December 5, 2009, ordering that the Department of Defense purchase the state run Thompson Correctional Center in Thompson Illinois, and prepare to accept prisoners transferred from the Guantanamo Bay facility. No such transfers ever occurred, however.Congress subsequently reaffirmed its restrictions on the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo to either the United States or foreign countries in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Similar restrictions have been imposed on subsequent Defense Authorization Bills since then. The 2014 NDAA spelled out in detail the procedure required to obtain Congressional approval for any transfer of detainees. In addition, Congress imposed other restrictions, including a provision that Congress has to be notified 30 days before any transfers are carried out. The White House announced on November 4, 2015, that it would submit a plan in early 2016, to shut down the detention facility and transfer the remaining detainees to U.S. soil. On February 23, 2016, President Obama, claiming that the continued operation of the detention facility at Guantanamo bay was ""contrary to our values"" and that it was an embarrassment to the United States that ""our closest allies have raised...with me continually,"" unveiled a proposal to shut down the facility and identified potential sites where detainees could be transferred.According to the latest proposals, prisoners could be housed in facilities in military prisons in Leavenworth, Kansas and Charleston, South Carolina or U.S. military bases in the continental United States. Several civilian prisons in Colorado were also proposed. There are a number of terrorists already being held in the ""super-max"" wing of the prison facility in Florence, Colorado. According to the Department of Defense, it would cost between $290 million and $475 million to prepare existing state or federal prisons to only hold Guantanamo detainees. Not surprisingly, ever since the Cuban revolution brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959, Cuba's government has opposed the United States' continued use of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay. Havana has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. presence in Cuba was on land ""illegally occupied"" under international law and has asserted that the 1903 and 1934 treaties were imposed on Cuba by the threat of force in violation of the Vienna Laws on Treaty Conventions. Since the revolution, other than for one instance in 1960, which the Cuban government claims was done in error, Havana has refused to cash any of the checks that the American government has submitted to Cuba for the payment of the land leased by the United States. Instead they have argued that the U.S. ""is in default.""Fidel Castro reportedly kept the un-cashed checks in a drawer of his desk and would on occasion show them to visitors, pointing out that the checks, made out to the Treasurer General of the Republic, referenced a position that no longer existed in the Cuban government.  Embassy of the Republic of Cuba, Washington DCDuring the ceremony for the raising of the Cuban flag at the newly reopened Cuban Embassy in Washington DC, on July 20, 2015, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez emphasized that the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba would not be ""complete"" until the ""return of the occupied territory in Guantanamo and respect for the sovereignty of Cuba.""Should Congress refuse to implement the president's proposal to close the detention facility at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, a foregone conclusion given the widespread Republican opposition to the proposal, he has a number of other options at his disposal. First of all, he could withhold the payment of the $4,085 lease payment that is due to Cuba on the anniversary of the Cuban treaty with the United States. The next installment is due on June 9, 2016. The failure to make the annual lease payment would be an event of default under the treaty. A second option would be for President Obama to simply terminate the 1934 treaty with Cuba by executive order. The Constitution of the United States specifically gives the president the authority to negotiate treaties on behalf of the United States subject to their ratification by two-thirds of the Senate. The Constitution, however, makes no reference to who can terminate a treaty and whether the president needs the consent of the Senate to do so.According to Michael Ramsey, a professor of law, at the University of San Diego Law School and a specialist in the areas of constitutional law and foreign relations law, Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution clearly states that, ""the President has the executive power of the United States."" Treaties are considered laws under Article VI of the Constitution and are the responsibility of the President to ""execute."" Professor Ramsay argues that when a president ""decides that a treaty should no longer apply, he is executing the treaty"" in accordance with the powers granted to him under the Constitution.Secondly, according to professor Ramsey, from the very beginning of the U.S government, it was recognized that, as Thomas Jefferson, George Washington's Secretary of State wrote, ""the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether; it belongs, then, to the head of that department (i.e., the president), except as to such portions of it as are specifically submitted to the Senate."" In other words, the conduct of the United States' foreign relations is clearly vested in the office of the president.The Constitution does not specify that the consent of the Senate is necessary for the termination of a treaty. There are certainly plenty of precedents where presidents have terminated existing treaties without the consent of the Senate. In 1939, President Roosevelt terminated the Treaty of Friendship with Japan. President Carter terminated the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan in 1979, when the United States formally recognized the People's Republic of China and its government in Beijing. President George W. Bush withdrew from the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in January of 2002. In none of these cases did the sitting president seek Senate ratification of his actions.Moreover, there is also a significant precedent with respect to ambassadorial and other presidential appointments. The Constitution requires Senate ratification of ambassadorial appointments, but is mute on the role of the Senate when it comes to the termination of such appointments. Although presidents have submitted such appointments to the Senate for confirmation, no single president has ever submitted an ambassadorial termination to the Senate for approval. Presidents have been free to fire ambassadors, or for that matter other appointees that require Senate approval, at will. According to professor Ramsey, ""the president has constitutional authority to abandon the base according to the terms of the treaty,"" although his actions could be constrained by Congressionally imposed statutory limits. In addition, based on historical precedent, it would seem that President Obama also has the constitutional power to terminate the 1934 treaty with Cuba that grants the United States the right to operate a naval base at Guantanamo Bay. From a practical standpoint, either act, should he decide to carry one out, would be largely symbolic. The president would still need Congressional approval for the funds to actually shut down the base and to transfer the detainees to other locations. Even if the treaty was terminated, it is highly unlikely that the Cuban government would attempt to seize control of the facility by force and risk a military confrontation with the American soldiers there. A unilateral termination of the treaty would certainly bolster Cuba's legal case against the U.S. that the base facility is illegal. It might also prompt the Cuban government to take the United States to the World Court and try to embarrass Washington by obtaining a judgement against the continued U.S. occupation of the facility.What exactly, if anything, is the Obama administration planning in regard to the continuation of the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba? We will certainly know by the end of the year.For additional comments from professor Michael Ramsey on the subject of this column go here."

Our study has shown that age is a major influence on what our immune landscapes look like, which is probably one of the reasons why there is a declining response to vaccination and reduced resistance to infection in older persons.""So, according to the researchers, something as simple as changing our immediate environments can cause profound changes in our immune systems, which impact our risk of developing auto-immune diseases, allergies, cancers, and many other health concerns.""The bad news is that 25 percent of the variation [in our immune systems] is caused by our genetics, so there is not much to do there. The good news is that 75 percent is not genetic,"" Liston said. ""If we can predict exactly how each environmental factor alters the immune system, we might end up being able to reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases by approaches as simple as altering diet or sleeping patterns."""

The program -- which has helped India’s solar industry get off the ground and become one of the fastest growing in the world -- required new projects be built with parts made in India. Despite India’s argument that the local product requirement was crucial to India's meeting its commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement, the WTO ruled that requirement unfairly discriminated against U.S. solar manufacturers.This is exactly the kind of decision that has many environmentalists worried about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the sweeping and controversial trade agreement President Barack Obama signed in February. The agreement has not yet been approved by Congress. Dozens of environmental organizations expressed deep concerns about the TPP.Friends of the Earth called the decision ""an outrage"" in a release. The group said that India “reasonably provided some preferences for local producers of solar energy in order to convert from a carbon economy to a green economy.""The Sierra Club called the decision a “step in the wrong direction” and said it could easily apply to U.S. subsidies for renewable energy: ""Almost half of U.S. states have programs that, like India’s, offer incentives for renewable energy production that creates local, green jobs. The U.S. should drop this case to avoid undermining climate protections abroad and at home.”The American appeal to the WTO only covered a small part of India's solar policy, said U.S. Trade Representative Press Secretary Andrew Bates. ""The single measure that the Obama Administration took issue with required the use of more expensive and less efficient solar equipment -- thereby raising the cost of generating clean energy across India,"" Bates said. In its submission to the WTO, the USTR's office cited an Indian solar industry group estimate that the domestic requirement increased prices by 15 to 16 percent. President Obama, Bates noted, has supported India's solar policy since it was launched in 2010. Obama's language at the time included a caveat alluding to disagreement about the made-in-India requirements. The WTO decision won’t have a major impact on India’s ability to meet its climate goals, said Anjali Jaiswal, director of the The Natural Resources Defense Council India Initiative. Yes, the Indian solar industry will now be undercut by a huge volume of cheaper solar products made in China and the U.S., she told HuffPost, but India was always going to import large amounts of solar hardware to meet its goals because of limited supply domestically. “When you look at, overall, the domestic content requirement, it affects about 10 percent of India’s [solar] industry,” Jaiswal noted.Jaiswal agreed that the trade rule dispute seemed like a throwback: “Some of the arguments are Reagan-era arguments that we see. And those are largely business interests protecting their business interests.”Now, she said, self-interest is being deployed to meet India’s solar goals.

17,POLITICS,Republicans Push Education Department To Defend Its Handling Of Sexual Assault Cases,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/education-secretary-title-ix_us_56cf45e8e4b0bf0dab31253d,Obama's pick to lead the department can expect to spend the next year justifying its treatment of colleges.,2016-02-26,Dr. John King speaks during his Senate confirmation hearing to become Education secretary on Feb. 25.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cf825c1500002b000b0ba7.jpeg?cache=MkGuiJ6DRL&ops=crop_13_572_2987_1703%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"If Dr. John King Jr. is confirmed to head the Department of Education, he can expect to spend the coming year defending to Republicans the agency's handling of campus sexual assault. At least, if the past two months are any indication.GOP members of the House and Senate have increasingly started looking into whether the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights has overstepped its bounds and bypassed regulations as it enforces the gender equity law Title IX. King, currently the acting secretary for the department, has been nominated to officially take the reins and appeared before House and Senate committees this week to discuss various Education Department initiatives. The confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Thursday, where he answered only one question about sexual assault, was an exception.The day before, King faced grilling from the House Education and Workforce Committee. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) told King she was ""very concerned"" that OCR was going around Congress and ""legislating"" through so-called Dear Colleague letters. An Education Department Dear Colleague letter is issued to every school in the country accepting federal funding and advises of current laws and regulations they must abide by.""I'm deeply concerned about the offices' legitimacy and effectiveness on these issues and the potential negative impact on students and institutions,"" Foxx said.Foxx questioned whether OCR was too focused on adding schools under investigation rather than ensuring ""justice"" in individual cases they review, alluding to inquiries that have dragged out for multiple years. Some students who filed complaints that resulted in investigations agree. Two complainants for an ongoing sexual harassment investigation of the University of Notre Dame sent a letter to Alexander and Murray on Thursday noting that their case has been open for 898 days at this point, according to a copy obtained by HuffPost. A group of activist faculty members sent a letter as well. Foxx also suggested that OCR was using these letters as a way of getting around formally changing regulations. She said the letters carry a ""strong intimidation tone"" and that schools see them as having the force of law.""The letters generally try to do two things: one is to clarify how the department interprets existing law and regulation, to provide clarity, and also to provide models of best practices,"" King responded. OCR received some defense Thursday from a collective of 27 student groups, including student governments, law clubs and activist organizations, who wrote a letter to Senate HELP committee chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Murray. ""It would be deeply inadvisable to condemn the Department's work to clarify the law, when schools have abdicated their responsibility to ensure educational equity for so long, with such devastating consequences for student survivors,"" the groups wrote. In 2013, student activists held demonstrations, gathered petition signatures and met with federal officials to press the Education Department to get tougher on schools investigated for their handling of sexual assault cases. They got their wish, as OCR became more forceful in declaring universities in violation of Title IX throughout 2014 and 2015. Yet some senators have questioned whether the Education Department has overstepped its role in how it enforces Title IX on sexual violence cases.In 2013, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) raised concerns about a resolution that the Education Department and the U.S. Department of Justice reached with the University of Montana. McCain suggested federal civil rights officials ""single-handedly"" redefined the meaning of sexual harassment at America's colleges. More recently, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) requested in January that the Education Department explain where it drew its authority to issue Dear Colleague letters on bullying, harassment and sexual violence, pointing specifically to letters from 2010 and 2011.One of the main concerns expressed by critics is that OCR has not allowed a ""notice and comment"" period before issuing consequential guidance -- the term for telling schools how to comply with existing regulations. Catherine Lhamon, the head of OCR, told Lankford in a letter last week that such a period wasn't necessary because the Dear Colleague letters don't carry the force of law, as the Supreme Court affirmed in a case last year. The letters, Lhamon said, merely advise the public and institutions of regulations OCR is already tasked with enforcing, and explain how it interprets existing law. OCR's 2010 Dear Colleague letter on bullying and harassment, Lhamon said, was based on previous guidance letters that did go through notice and comment periods. The 2011 letter on sexual assault built on precedent from letters of findings that came from Title IX investigations of schools under previous administrations, she added. Dissatisfied with Lhamon's response, Lankford's office told HuffPost it is considering next steps but hasn't yet determined what they are._______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

He cited the new law as a significant factor in his decision, saying the policies ""don't make any logical sense at all"" in a university environment.""It's not like there are a bunch of pheasants roaming around the campus, it's not a hunting environment,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem to be appropriate to this kind of place.""Gun-friendly Texas announced the changes last year, which will allow students and faculty with permits to carry concealed handguns on campus, in classrooms and in some dormitories. The law goes into effect at universities in August and at community colleges next year.Steiner noted that a university atmosphere, centered on work, stress and discussion, would be irreversibly shifted if students knew guns were in the room. He said they would only serve to increase self-censorship, especially in a department like architecture where students are encouraged to honestly critique their classmate's work.""How do you criticize someone when you know or suspect that they have a firearm?"" Steiner asked. ""Having been in those situations, people can lose their tempers. That's not a situation where a firearm would enhance the experience.""This point has already drawn fire after the University of Houston faculty senate showed professors a slideshow this month discouraging them from discussing ""sensitive topics"" and encouraging them to refrain from criticizing the new laws.In a letter addressed the university, UT president Gregory L. Fenves wrote the decision to comply with the policy ""has been the greatest challenge of [his] presidency to date,"" but he had an obligation to uphold the law. Several areas, including some laboratories, areas with children and some university dorms, will prohibit handguns, but classrooms will allow them.""I do not believe handguns belong on a university campus,"" he wrote. ""Although there is great anxiety about the impact of SB 11, I urge you not to let this weaken us as a university community."""

On his song, ""Famous,"" West came under fire for the lyrics: ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that bitch famous.""Though West said Swift (and Kardashian) were originally cool with the lyrics, Tay's reps swiftly dismissed his claim, saying that the singer ""cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message."" Which brings us to the part in her new post where Kardashian says she is ""wanting everyone to be as honest as Kanye."" Does this mean that Swift might've signed off on the controversial lyrics?

Rick Snyder (R) announced Friday. ""Flint residents should not have to pay for water they cannot drink,"" Snyder said in a release.The water won't be free, however -- just less expensive. Flint's water turned brown and gross shortly after the city switched its water supply to the Flint River in April 2014, but Snyder's administration insisted it was fine until last fall -- when it admitted some Flint kids had been poisoned by high levels of lead in the water. Flint switched back to the Detroit water system in October, but residents are still relying on bottled water for drinking and cooking because their taps remain unsafe. All along, Flint residents have been paying the highest water bills in the nation, according to a survey by an environmental nonprofit called Food & Water Watch. Nationally, the average annual bill was $316 in January 2015, compared with $864 for Flint. The relief Snyder announced Friday is the result of a $30 million piece of legislation passed earlier by the Michigan legislature. Rather than refunds for past payments, residents will get credits on water bills going forward, until the total credit received equals the amount paid for water usage since April 2014. Since Flint water bills are divided between consumption and sewer usage, residents will still have to pay the sewer half. The release from Snyder's office says the credits will only apply until regulators deem the water safe to drink again, which could be a matter of weeks or months. ""Making the water that comes out of the tap in Flint safe to drink again is the top priority,"" Snyder said.HuffPost readers: Do you live in Flint?
