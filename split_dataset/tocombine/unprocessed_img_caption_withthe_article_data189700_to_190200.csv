One U.S. study, for instance, found that half of mothers aren't getting appropriate amounts of shuteye.According to those findings, a full 59 percent of full-time working mothers weren't getting enough sleep, and 48 percent of stay-at-home moms reported the same, according to MSNBC. A National Sleep Foundation poll found that the average woman between the ages of 30 and 60 only sleeps six hours and 41 minutes a night.""Becoming a parent was to insomnia what a box of cupcakes and a gallon drum of Hershey's chocolate syrup is to diabetes,"" HuffPost blogger Teresa Strasser wrote last March. ""What can be managed under the best of circumstances is now a full-scale crisis that has been ignited by the sweet nectar of parenthood.""By now we all know the serious health effects linked too little sleep, including weight problems, moodiness and hypertension, among others.So this Mother's Day, give your mom the gift of rest.
