In the Church, discernment, listening to our hearts, and deep prayer and meditation, are all called for before entering into or ending such a union.",2014-11-18,2014-11-17-10547013_872700842761187_3877595845183240904_o1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-17-10547013_872700842761187_3877595845183240904_o1-thumb.jpg,"What a beautiful and blessed morning, learning that it is official that Pope Francis is coming to Philadelphia in September, 2015! ""The World Meeting on Families"" is what I'm most passionate about and is constantly on my mind. I passionately write about success and how to connect the dots that helped me. I owe my surviving and keeping a family together to my Catholic upbringing and spiritual search. As beloved Mother Teresa quoted: ""The way you help heal the world is you start with your own family."" Being widowed and having a family tragedy nearly destroyed me. I couldn't bear to think of what it might do to an innocent child.Pope Francis's visit to Philadelphia will truly be the highlight in my life and maybe yours, too. I continue to keep my heart open to learn more about the concerns regarding traditional marriage that might affect us all. Below is a tribute to the Catholic Church on family and marriage as the foundation that served my soul's highest interest. Whether you are religious or not, perhaps there is something here that might relate to you as well. As I wrote in Imprinted Wisdom:The Power of LoveMy parents had been very strict, raising us with morals and values through the word of God, rather than in the ways of the world. Those values stayed with me and I still practice them as much as possible with my own children. I feel blessed that I've endured some things in marriage that others may have given up over, and feel that Church teachings reflect the true picture of marriage, divorce, and their effects on children that we cannot always see.I have seen those vows‒""for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health""‒neglected, even though we should view them as a blessing and a protection. In my marriage, and in my life, I have learned not to pass judgment; I also do not feel that entering into a marriage agreement or leaving it should be taken lightly. With more than half of all marriages ending in divorce, we need to give this matter serious consideration as there are many long-range consequences for everyone involved.This is not a stand against divorce, but rather a stand for love. I have seen examples of people ending a marriage only to realize later that they hadn't been so bad off after all. In the Church, discernment, listening to our hearts, and deep prayer and meditation, are all called for before entering into or ending such a union. But many who choose divorce are abused, physically or mentally, and in those cases, not only their happiness, but also their lives are in danger, and surely God does not intend for them to remain in harm's way.One of my heartfelt prayers was to be able to keep my family together, and this prayer came with the greatest challenges and obstacles. Staying together as a family is probably one of the hardest things in the world for some of us, and it surely wasn't always easy for me. In a marriage, when we think that someone else, in some other place, would bring us greater joy, most of the time it's only our thoughts that we need to change. In those instances, our disharmony comes from inside us, from within our own minds.  Staying in a marriage or union for the sake of keeping the family together can provide just as many challenges to overcome as divorce. But the persevering individuals who stay in the union may have been able to do so by finding peace of mind through faith, or else by investing in other aspects of their marriage, perhaps by focusing on the children or on their profession, something that gives them a sense of fulfillment, thereby taking pressure off their partner. This can deepen their relationship with God and allow them to grow. Some who choose to leave the union or marriage because of disharmony, rather than abuse, often find new obstacles and challenges in the next partner or circumstance. That is why it is such a gift when we at last begin to see the truth; for some of us, our greatest opportunity to start over comes from staying right where we are. My own marriage improved greatly only when I silently vowed to take God as my spiritual husband. In doing so, I could actually feel the joy coming from my earthly husband, almost as though a weight had been lifted from him. And I found that my own joy and contentment grew as well. A sacred vow of emotional interdependence and a reliance on the word of God is a marriage made in heaven, whether we stay single or not.I relate deeply to 1 Corinthians 7: 7-9 because it gives me a clearer understanding that God knows us, His children, better than we know ourselves. The scripture reminds me that no one is going to fill us with as much love as God does. And maybe this is the first vow that we need to make, in a marriage of the Sacred, before making marriage vows with another person. To me, this union with God seems to be the only kind that will keep us on the right path, married or not.Could it be that the holy marriage described in the sacrament of Holy Orders, in which priests are ordained, is actually meant for all of us, not just for priests? A marriage made in heaven, based on a love and unity through the Holy Spirit that no one else can ever separate us from, makes more sense the longer I ponder it.About Catherine Nagle: Catherine grew up in Philadelphia with 16 brothers and sisters, reared by loving, old school Italian parents.

Republicans are counting on a swift vote in early 2015 on building the Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast now that Republicans clearly have the numbers in the Senate.

On average one significant pipeline incident occurs in the country every 30 hours, according to the data.So what would happen if Keystone XL is built? The U.S. State Department estimates Keystone XL could spill up to 100 times during its lifetime.One difference between Keystone XL and the vast majority of other pipelines that have spilled is that it will be carrying tar sands oil, which has proven very difficult, if not impossible, to clean up. A 2010 spill of tar sands oil in the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, for example, has yet to be cleaned up despite four years of effort. Another tar sands spill in 2013 fouled an entire neighborhood in Arkansas. Federal regulators have acknowledged that Keystone XL, too, will spill.TransCanada's existing Keystone I tar sands pipeline has reportedly leaked at least 14 times since it went into operation in June 2010, including one spill of 24,000 gallons. The State Department's environmental reviews have pointed out that spills from Keystone XL are likely. The pipeline will cross a number of important rivers, including the Yellowstone and Platte, as well as thousands of smaller rivers and streams.Yes, politicians are looking to score political points in their vote on Keystone XL. But in the rest of the world, this is no game and if Keystone XL moves forward, the losers will be streams, rivers, wildlife, water, our climate, and, ultimately, all of us who depend on them."

And you see that his suit fits him like a glove. Like a very tight glove. This is important information.,2014-11-18,"NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 17: Actor Benedict Cumberbatch attends 'The Imitation Game' New York Premiere at Ziegfeld Theater on November 17, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fe9d3c000018010d1dd8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am sure that you, too, have fantasized about what ""The Meeting"" would be like. Perhaps there is a small crowd of fans outside an event, with you at the front. Your fingers brush his as you hand him a Sharpie to sign his name and you exchange meaningful looks and maybe a ""hello"" or ""thank you."" Or you pass him on the street and you manage to both acknowledge his presence and respect his privacy with a quick wink and nod of the head. Or he saves your life on a busy London street by pulling you out of the way of a speeding car. Or he comes up to you at the launch party for your new book to tell you how much he wants to play the main character in the movie version. I am just saying -- it could happen. In reality, ""The Meeting"" will not really be a meeting at all, and it will go down like this: By some weird, uncharacteristic stroke of luck, you score tickets for you and a friend in New York City for a screening of his new movie, The Imitation Game, followed by a Q&A with him. It's only two hours away from where you live! It promises to be a fabulous evening with dinner and drinks and a city shimmering in early Christmas excitement and lights. You get ready. You wear skinny pants and big earrings and sparkly eye shadow, because if any occasion calls for sparkly eye shadow, it's this one. You draw the line at wearing Spanx. A girl has to be comfortable for ""The Meeting."" You accidentally spray perfume in your mouth right before you leave the house, so for the rest of the evening everything tastes slightly of daisies and alcohol. Dinner is lovely. You and your friend arrive at the event and decide to wait outside for a bit. Because clearly, there is a chance that the man will pull up at the front entrance, in a cab. The sight of every black Suburban gets your heart racing and you clutch your phone in your coat pocket. There are a lot of black Suburbans in New York City. You feel a bit ridiculous, but not as ridiculous as you thought you would. So you keep waiting in the cool evening air. At some point, you realize that this is sort of silly, and not wanting to miss the main event, you head inside. You watch his new movie and it is everything that you hoped it would be and everything the critics say it is. You laugh and cry and think deep thoughts and feel hopeful and sad at the end. Mostly sad. Then you have to pee. You may or may not knock down a couple of old ladies on your way to the bathroom and thus you only have to wait in line for 10 minutes. When you get back to the auditorium, you settle in your seat and just as you get your camera out of your purse, the light in the auditorium blinks once, maybe twice.The curtain on the stage goes up. And there he is. Just like that. Like it's his job to be sitting behind all curtains on all stages. Like he belongs there. No big deal. You may or may not whoop and screech a little with the crowd, but it's all so intoxicating and your voice gets lost in all the noise and excitement anyway. You try to not grin like an idiot. ""Dignity, woman, dignity!""He is far enough that your camera only takes crappy pictures, and you sort of give up, because you just want to watch and listen. He is close enough though to see his face and his expressions and he is exactly like you imagined him. You are sure that he talks about really, really smart and interesting things, but what those things are exactly is a bit of a blur. Some people start to leave and you think, ""Really, people? Really?"" But you get to move up a couple of rows and you get a less crappy picture. And you see that his suit fits him like a glove. Like a very tight glove. This is important information. And then it's over. Before ""The Meeting,"" you thought that you'd be sad when it's over. But you are not. This is exactly how it was supposed to happen. You catch a late train home and feel a sudden rush of excitement and creativity that you haven't felt in a few weeks and that, frankly, sort of worried you a bit. But now you are full of ideas. It's not like this one evening has changed your life. You never expected that. But adventure inspires. Talent inspires. Intelligent, interesting people inspire. You feel grateful that you were able to soak all of that up tonight. It's 2 a.m. by the time you put on your comfy pajamas and check on your little boy, who is sleeping curled up like a cat. Your husband left the hallway light on for you. You crawl into bed and think about how tomorrow, there are lunch boxes to pack, emails to answer, appointments to keep, conference calls to attend. You think about the long, dark winter ahead and feel sort of OK about it. You feel like something has shifted, but there, in the early morning darkness, you can't quite put a finger on it. Your insides are buzzing and you just feel like you can tackle whatever comes next. You think about how odd it is that such fuel, such spark can come from the most unexpected places: from a city, a movie, a crowd. From a man in a nice suit, saying interesting things. From a man you never really met.Zsofi McMullin blogs at http://zsofiwrites.com"
3,RELIGION,Pope Francis Calls Assisted Suicide 'A Sin Against God',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-assisted-suicide_n_6172982.html,,2014-11-17,"Pope Francis pauses during the weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square, at the Vatican, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2014. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f3193c000032000db0e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) Pope Francis has warned doctors and ethicists on several hot-button social issues, attacking abortion, embryonic stem cell research and euthanasia as “playing with life” and “a sin against God.”In a strongly worded address that marked a departure for a pope who tends to focus more on social justice issues, Francis denounced what he called the “false sense of compassion” that was used to promote abortion and those who regarded euthanasia as “an act of dignity.”“We are living in a time of experimentation with life. But a bad experiment,” the pope told members of the Association of Italian Catholic Doctors at the Vatican Saturday (Nov. 15).Francis also condemned in vitro fertilization, which he said promoted children as “a right rather than a gift to welcome,” and embryonic stem cell research, which “used human beings as guinea pigs to presumably save others.”“This is playing with life,” he said. “Be careful, because this is a sin against the Creator: against God the Creator, who created things this way.”Francis has spoken out several times against the assisted suicide movement, which he considers to be a symptom of today’s “throw-away culture” that views the sick and elderly as a drain on society.On Saturday, the pope said it was unlawful to take a life and warned of the dangers posed to the elderly by “hidden euthanasia” in our “culture of waste.”The Vatican’s top bioethicist recently condemned as “reprehensible” the doctor-assisted death of 29-year-old American Brittany Maynard, who said she wanted to die with dignity because she was suffering from terminal brain cancer.“This woman did this thinking she would die with dignity, but this is a mistake,” said Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, the head of the Pontifical Academy for Life.Maynard, who moved to Portland, Ore., to take advantage of the state’s assisted suicide law, took a lethal prescription provided by a doctor and died on Nov. 1 after leaving family and friends a final farewell message.The pope did not mention the Maynard case but urged doctors to think carefully about their work and take courageous decisions in their care of the elderly, ill and disabled while protecting the sanctity of human life.“Your work wants to witness by word and by example that human life is always sacred, valuable and inviolable,” the pontiff said. “And as such, it must be loved, defended and cared for.”"
4,CRIME,"2 Men Both Wrongfully Convicted For Same Crime, 17 Years Apart",Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alstory-simon_n_6155658.html,,2014-11-17,"Alstory Simon shows his emotion as he speaks to reporters while leaving the Jacksonville Correction Center as a free man Thursday, Oct. 30, 2014, in Jacksonville Ill. Simon's confession helped free a death row inmate in a case that was instrumental in the campaign to end capital punishment in Illinois. Anthony Porter had spent 16 years on death row and his supporters maintained he was wrongfully convicted. Simon was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison. But the Cook County State's Attorney's Office began re-examining Simon's conviction last year after he recanted his confession. Simon alleged he was coerced into making it by a private investigator. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b9c82100003300c657bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No one argues that two teens were shot and killed in bleachers above a swimming pool on Chicago's South Side more than 30 years ago. What's harder to say is who the shooter was late that August night in Washington Park.That's because two men have been separately accused, convicted and, more surprisingly, exonerated for the 1982 killings of 18-year-old Jerry Hillard and 19-year-old Marilyn Green.Police and prosecutors first thought the couple were killed in an armed robbery by Anthony Porter, a convicted felon. Multiple witnesses allegedly saw him in the park around the time of the 1 a.m. shooting. A jury agreed and condemned Porter to death. But he was hastily freed in 1999 when another man confessed in a news broadcast to the killings.A NEW SUSPECTThe Cook County state attorney's office reset its sights on Alstory Simon, the man who confessed to shooting Hillard and Green in a dispute about drug money. Simon pleaded guilty to pulling the trigger and tearfully apologized to Green's mother, saying that he accidentally shot her daughter. Down came a 37-year sentence.But in a remarkable twist, Simon regained his freedom on Oct. 30. The current Cook County state attorney, Anita Alvarez, cast doubt on Simon's confession and the original lawyer who represented him. Alvarez leveled the blame for Simon's predicament on the Medill Innocence Project, a team of students and a journalism professor from Northwestern University with a stated mission of freeing innocent prisoners. Her office wouldn’t share copies of the review that laid out specific misdeeds by the Northwestern team, but Simon’s new attorneys said their client confessed because he’d been threatened and promised money from book and movie deals if he cooperated.It was all but a formality when Circuit Judge Paul Biebel vacated the murder and voluntary manslaughter record. LIFE AFTER PRISONThe dust has just begun to settle for Simon, 64. He spoke exclusively with The Huffington Post about his transition to life outside the walls of Illinois' Jacksonville Correctional Center.""It feels good to be out,"" Simon said on a telephone from an undisclosed location. ""I've still kind of been sheltered away. I still kind of feel myself institutionalized in many respects. The world has changed so much with the technology.""For 14 of his 15 years in prison, Simon was locked in a cell for 23 hours a day with another inmate. It’s no wonder that freedom has come as a shock to Simon.""It's like a frightening experience in a sense,"" he told HuffPost. ""I've got to get adjusted all over again. I was so used to being confined for so long that I still feel a sense of solitude is a security blanket. I was surprised by how much fear I had crossing the street. I feel more comfortable being secluded in my room."" WHO'S GUILTY?How could a conviction fall apart for the second time in a single case? And if Simon isn't guilty, who is?Alvarez, the state attorney, stopped short of saying he's innocent. She blamed former Northwestern University journalism professor David Protess, his students in the Medill Innocence Project and private investigator Paul Ciolino for manipulating Simon. Her review ""raised serious questions about the integrity"" of their work. “At the end of the day and in the best interests of justice, we could reach no other conclusion but that the investigation of this case has been so deeply corroded and corrupted that we can no longer maintain the legitimacy of this conviction,” Alvarez said.The argument Protess, Ciolino and the students had assembled against Simon that until recently passed official scrutiny went as follows:The mother of Marilyn Green saw Simon and his wife Inez Jackson with her daughter and Hillard shortly before the shooting. Jackson told the Northwestern unit that she'd seen Simon shoot the couple. She accused him on television. At least one other witness has lined up against Simon. He then made the confession, recorded in his Milwaukee home by Ciolino. Simon refused to explain why he confessed and repeatedly admitted to the killings, because he's considering pursuing litigation over his lost years.DOUBTS ABOUT SIMON'S GUILTA new documentary made with Simon's participation, called ""Murder In the Park,"" charges that Ciolino resorted to shady moves to coerce Simon into confessing. Ciolino brandished a gun, promised Simon money from book and movie deals, and duped him by saying he'd get a two-year sentence if he cooperated, according to director Shawn Rech's film.Jack Rimland, then Simon's defense attorney, had a conflict of interest, according to Rech: Rimland worked closely with Ciolino and Protess, people who portrayed Simon as guilty. Protess and Rimland overlooked the fact that six original witnesses who said they saw Porter commit the shooting, commit a robbery or, at least, run through the park at the time of the shooting, according to documents Rech cites. The case weakened as Simon's estranged and dying wife Jackson recanted her accusation.""The decision [to prosecute Simon] flew in the face of all the evidence,"" Rech told HuffPost.""A Murder in the Park"" premieres Nov. 17 at the DOC NYC festival in Manhattan. Simon will be in attendance. ""You judge it for yourself and you'll see if I'm guilty,"" Simon said, the closest he came to an outright denial. THE FALLOUTProtess' gleaming reputation was already partly tarnished before Alvarez's announcement. He retired from Northwestern when a university review said he'd made ""false and misleading statements"" about his work on a separate wrongful conviction. He now runs the Chicago Innocence Project. He declined to comment, but has written blogs for HuffPost with a full-throated defense of his investigation, and criticism of the motives of Simon's attorneys and the documentarian.Ciolino remains a Chicago P.I. and says it's hard to ignore the incriminating statements Simon made.""Simon confessed to a Milwaukee TV reporter, his own lawyer and others since he confessed to me. You explain that,"" Ciolino said in a statement.Any fault must rest with the Cook County state attorney's office, according to Paul Cates, the spokesman for the Innocence Project. (The national Innocence Project, which tries to find DNA evidence to free the wrongly convicted, is not affiliated with Protess or the Chicago Innocence Project.)""Whatever sins that David committed, it was ultimately the state that decided to prosecute him,"" Cates told HuffPost. ""If they no longer feel confident in their evidence, then they did the right thing.""Richard Devine, the Cook County attorney whose office prosecuted Simon, is now in private practice. He did not respond to requests for comment. MOVING FORWARDThe ripples from these events traveled in many directions. The mishandling of Porter's case led to former Illinois Gov. George Ryan (R) banning the death penalty.Witness testimony in the case was always shaky, and after Simon's confession, even more witnesses changed their statements. Additionally, after Simon pleaded guilty in Chicago, prosecutors in Milwaukee stopped pursuing him as a suspect in another killing there that had once been linked to him.""It was just a lot of suspicion,"" Milwaukee Assistant District Attorney Mark Williams told HuffPost. ""There wasn't a whole lot of solid evidence against him.""With those cases and his prison time behind him, the simple pleasures are enough to satisfy Simon now. He's been taking long walks, visiting his daughter and grandson, and cooking favorite foods like banana bread. ""I would like to maybe settle down in a nice, warm-climate place and maybe travel a little bit and keep my family close,"" Simon said. ""I'm getting on with my life.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated attorney Jack Rimland's name and wrongly said Alstory Simon was under investigation in two Milwaukee killings. Simon was investigated for one homicide there. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact The Author"
