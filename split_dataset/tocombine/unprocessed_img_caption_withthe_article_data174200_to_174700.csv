They could be hoping in vain.Weather: Low 60s with a chance of isolated thunderstorms. Watch out for lightning.Injuries:* Detroit -- DT Corey Williams is questionable. DE Cliff Avril and star safety Louis Delmas are probable, but unfortunately CB Bill Bentley is still doubtful and CB Jacob Lacey is out. Please note that in all of these instances, the player is on the defensive side of the pigskin. Watch to see whom Bears offensive coordinator Mike Tice chooses to test.Chicago -- When your team is facing a suspect Lions special teams squad, the last person you want hurt is Devin Hester. Hester has a quadriceps injury, but is probable. Stay tuned. Promising rookie WR Alshon Jeffrey is out. Keys to the Game: Lions offense -- Matthew Stafford is not having a banner year. The Lions barely prevailed in Week 6 and struggled again for most of Sunday. For the first three quarters of their last game, Matthew Stafford was 1-of-5 for 28 yards and an interception on throws aimed more than 15 yards downfield. Then he turned it on in the fourth quarter. Again. Is he channeling Tim Tebow? No. 9 finished with 311 yards passing, a TD passing, a TD rushing and one interception. Although Calvin Johnson has yet to catch a TD pass from Stafford, the all-Pro wideout ended the day with six receptions for 135 yards. The tight ends caught six passes in this rally, which is significant because they have not been much of a receiving threat in 2012. More importantly, there was a running back sighting in Detroit. In fact, there were two. Mikel Leshoure managed 70 yards on 15 carries and Joique Bell joined the party for 38 rushing yards of his own. If Detroit can keep that up, life should get easier for Stafford and all of the WRs. Despite being somewhat scoring-challenged, the Lions possess the second passing offense in the league. No excuses then. And of course, 42-year-old Jason Hanson continues to be a machine in the kicking game. Hanson admitted to being nervous before nailing the game-winner. Awww -- that's sweet. Who knew he even had nerves?Reinvented return man Stefan Logan pitched in with 98 yards of his own. Now, if they can just keep Devin Hester from scoring on returns...Lions defense -- One would credit the Silver and Blue D with two interceptions and a fumble recovery - -except that they were playing the Eagles (Yeah, and Juan Castillo was the person Philly fired.) The return of Delmas had an expected elevating effect that went beyond his interception. The Lions secondary had not picked off an opposing quarterback this season. Jay Cutler, take note.  Bears offense -- With both Matt Forte and Michael Bush, the Bears should rank much higher in rushing than tenth. The key to this game will be whether or not these running backs can get it in gear and grind out some yards and clock time. Likewise, Jay Cutler's passing attack should be better than 23rd in the NFL, but there are still protection and dropped-ball issues. Chicago is coming off a bye and a drubbing of the Jacksonville Jaguars. The only legitimately contending team the Bears have beaten is Dallas. Against the Cowboys, Cutler went 18-of-24 for 275 yards and two scores. The Bears rushed 25 times for 93 yards. If they can have success with this offensive structure, Chicago will win. If they abandon the run, it's a toss-up. Bears defense -- Yes, we know they're old. They're also the top-ranked run D in the NFL. Both passing defenses are hovering in the middle of the pack. However, the Bears lead the NFL with 13 interceptions. That is a statistic that may well have some bearing on this game.Viewing note -- The Lions had 16 penalties last week. Of course they did. Let's not forget that the last time these teams played resulted in a bench-clearing brawl. Straight Up: Bears Against the Spread: Bears -6.5 (Do not go over this; remember the strength of schedule -- or lack thereof.)

2,DIVORCE,Why Premarital Counseling Didn't Work For Me,"Amira Young, Contributor
Writer, La Divorcee Vita",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-premarital-counseling_us_5b9c65f2e4b03a1dcc7e5a7e,"I went into my marriage with my eyes on forever, and I needed the tools for it.",2012-10-20,Discontented bride - young woman holding beautiful wedding flowers bouquet (peony),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c65f22000003100fd8d8d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was a beautiful Sunday morning over five-and-a-half years ago. My ex and I sat in a class with 10 other couples -- most of them in their late 20s and early to mid-30s. We were just babies compared to them. I stared at the girls' huge diamond engagement rings in wonder compared to my tiny one. I was feeling butterflies in my stomach. How did I get here?A woman with dark hair stood in front of the class and smiled. ""Welcome to your first premarital class,"" she said. ""I'm your instructor, and I'm a marriage and family therapist. In the next 10 weeks, we will be exploring marriage and what you will need to make it last. This will be intense, and not all of you may last. But if you do, you will have an excellent chance of lasting for the long haul.""During our nine-month engagement, my ex and I took the the ten-week course described above and a four-week course with a rabbi. We didn't miss a session of either and did our homework dutifully. We weren't going into marriage flippantly. And yet here I am, divorced. What went wrong?My parents and in-laws paid for the first class as an engagement present for us. I was more than happy to attend. I went into my marriage with my eyes on forever, and I needed the tools for it.After introductions, we were handed spiral notebooks with the coursework and were given our first lesson and homework assignment, all based around expectations. What did we expect from our marriage? Were we both in agreement about certain issues and understanding where the other was coming from in terms of the future? Were we ready?It seemed like we were going about things the right way, but I was still concerned as we left the class. Were we really on the same page? I wasn't entirely sure where I stood, or even if I was ready to be married. My ex and I went through our first homework assignment: a list of expectations. I would read the questions, state my answers and he would follow with his. They seemed to match most of the time, so I figured it was right and wondered why I was worrying.In the following weeks, we learned about conflict resolution and fighting fair, sex in marriage and even how to handle our finances. About three weeks before the class ended, we met with the therapist for a private session. My ex led the conversation, talking loudly about how much he loved me, how set we were to be married and how great everything was. I quietly sat there and nodded. I felt like I was invisible, and my gut was telling me there was something amiss in this whole situation.I was dying for the therapist to ask me questions, particularly without my ex in the room. I had a hard time being honest about my doubts when he was full speed ahead. But I was always told that this was good for me, to be quiet and to not let my worries take over. So I went along with it.As we transitioned to the religious class, we seemed to have a good grounding. The religious class provided us some extra knowledge, but nothing that we didn't already know moving forward. We seemed to be ready. On our wedding day, the officiating rabbi said that no matter how many classes we took or how prepared we seemed to be, marriage was a whole different story. And he was certainly right.I was amazed that after we got married, all the lessons we learned seem to disappear. Rather than fighting fair, my ex became an attack dog, calling me names when our lessons clearly stated not to do so. He was not alone; when the name-calling started, I would respond by stonewalling or completely tuning him out, which is a major no-no. Regarding compromising about sex, he had agreed to schedule it before the wedding. After we were married, he put up wall after wall to prevent us from having sex and said that if we scheduled it, it would lose its spontaneity. And finances? Don't even get me started.It didn't make sense. Weren't we great students? We prepared ourselves dutifully and should have had a terrific marriage.It was only several years later, when my ex and I were in marriage counseling to solve our problems, did I realize the truth. He was talking about sending our non-existent kids to a local private school. I reminded him that the night after the marriage class about children, we took a walk and I talked about how I wanted to send my kids to public school. At the time he agreed.""I figured that we wouldn't have enough money, so that's why I said it,"" he said. I was curious about what other expectations he had lied about, so I went back to that first assignment one night. It became clear to me that he wasn't be honest at the time; he just said what I wanted to hear.I continued to fight for our marriage despite the dishonesty, because I am not one to give up. But when you start with a faulty foundation, the structure just won't stay standing. And no matter how good of a student you are, you don't really know success until you experience failure and know what it looks like. After all, the key to being a good pupil in life is to learn from your mistakes."

Armstrong said Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2012, he is stepping down as chairman of his Livestrong cancer-fighting charity so the group can focus on its mission instead of its founder's problems. The move came a week after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency released a massive report detailing allegations of widespread doping by Armstrong and his teams when he won the Tour de France seven consecutive times from 1999 to 2005. (AP Photo/Peter Morrison, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb19c8f2200003401db5dcc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've swallowed everything about the Lance Armstrong/Livestrong controversy whole. I am a nonprofit consultant that helps organizations find their way out of big messes. I find that messes are always symptomatic of larger illnesses (please forgive the pun) and that they are often opportunities to rethink and figure out what is right and true.Here's what I believe is right and true. Lance Armstrong is a hero to millions afflicted with cancer. I don't believe that it is about how many medals he has (or doesn't have). It's about the fact that he made a decision to touch peoples' lives as a cancer survivor. The statistics speak for themselves. Livestrong has raised millions to fight for a cure. Lance has talked to and sat with thousands of cancer survivors over these years and no one will strip the medals of hope he placed around the neck of each of them.It absolutely stinks when our heroes fail us. But what is it about him that cast him as a failure? He cheated to win. More than once. OK, I get it. That is bad. But let me be provocative for a moment. If you had cancer -- if you had it bad -- would you cheat to beat it if you could? I am thinking long and hard about this.So Lance Armstrong is a tough cancer survivor who did what it took to be a champion. In one arena he crossed the line. But maybe where it really counts, he became a true champion -- for all cancer survivors everywhere.And that's a role he cannot be not be stripped of. He should't be.So here's my recommendation. The last thing we should do is hide Lance under the staircase like evil Muggle stepparents.Lance Armstrong needs to get back on the road. In a car this time. Not as a celebrity, not with an entourage, not even with his agent. Maybe just a few friends. I'm picturing a smart car. He does, after all, have a lot to learn.Once a month or once a quarter, Lance should hit the road. He should map out a route that enables him to visit the most numbers of hospitals large and small. He should visit the cancer wards. No fanfare. He should sit by bedsides and listen. He should hang a figurative medal of hope around the neck of each person he meets. Maybe he'll talk about the choices he has made and what they feel like. I bet those cancer patients will hear his story a bit differently from others.No press while Lance is there. Livestrong Communications staff should keep them away until Lance is back in his car and back on the tour route. Then the local press might just want to talk to the folks he coached. Not to hear Lance's stories but to hear theirs. These stories will fuel Livestrong's work.I am not a cancer survivor so I don't know for sure. But I'm betting that a guy who helped to build a $30-50 million organization to fight cancer and has beaten it himself would still be a hero to me."

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d75e2500003600388e1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The social media revolution has altered how brands engage with the social consumer. This is an age where influence triumphs over awareness, where consumers are more wary of promotional messages, and where brands are continually shaped by consumer perception and less by themselves. Brands have to cope with being an open book in the digital ecosystem, and no longer be the sole author of their brand messaging. Indeed, it is an exceedingly challenging age for brands, marketers, and advertisers.With this in mind, it is important to consider how brands can create the relevant content to support their digital assets and drive meaningful dialogue about their brand. More importantly, brands have to consider how to make their content social, which entails going beyond content consumption and facilitating content sharing. Social content is shareable because it inspires emotions and provokes reactions. It is a challenging premise indeed: How can brands continue to inspire, stay relevant, and excel in this socially charged ecosystem? This post revolves around why it's important to write a social brand story, why a social brand story is an ecosystem of content iterations, and why some content is more contagious than others. The team at Singtel, Singapore's largest telco and one of the country's oldest companies, is the inspiration for this post.Truly, it's no longer a question of whether brands should be on social media, but how brands can distinguish themselves, secure consumer trust, and succeed in this competitive digital ecosystem. This is a story of how Singtel got more social online, and did it right.Neuroscience supports the importance of writing a social brand story  The work by Dr. Paul MacLean, who wrote about the Triune Brain Theory and influenced modern-day neuroscience, has classified our brain into three distinct portions -- the reptilian brain (decision-making), the limbic brain (emotional center) and the neocortex (rational thinking). Robert Ornstein wrote in The Evolution of Consciousness that our reptilian brain is our ""fight or flight brain,"" whose chief purpose is concerned with our survival. As our decision-making hub, our reptilian brain is motivated by trust, has immensely strong inertia, and would often go with the ""safest"" choice that guarantees our ""survival."" So how does this relate to social content? Research from neuroscience has shown that people connect better with stories and not just facts. This is substantiated by Roger Dooley's work in neuromarketing. In Brainfluence, Roger uncovered that 95 percent of our decision-making is not affected by conscious rational thinking. In fact, our decision-making is motivated largely by our emotions and our survival instinct, and specifically, our ability to trust. Storytelling is the magic sauce that allows the brand to become more than an entity, but to be an experience -- an experience that aids the consumer in the decision-making process. Ultimately, a social brand story appeals to the emotional, removes the fear, and builds trust. People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. -- Maya AngelouInstead of using hard facts and throwing excessive promotions at consumers, focus on writing a social brand story as a constant motif where meaningful social content can be sprung from.In Singapore, SingTel decided to invest in creating its own social brand story. The push was to build emotional attachment, personify the brand, and make the brand as approachable as possible. This journey started officially for the brand in November 2011, where SingTel unveiled TGIS (Thank Goodness It's SingTel), a bi-weekly lifestyle series on the brand's YouTube channel that showcased the latest in consumer technologies, local news, events and trends. It was important for the team that the content produced had a strong focus on relevance and value-add, and less about overly-promotional drivel. Photo courtesy of Miguel Bernas""Our approach with TGIS is always to figure out what kind of content consumers want, not whether we have a product to sell. Any mention of SingTel products and services is in context and must feel like it belongs there."" -- Miguel Bernas, Director of Digital Marketing, SingtelIn each episode of Season 2 in TGIS, for example, relevant SingTel services and products are included as non-intrusive click-throughs within the show to guide viewers along if they wish to find out more information about the various products mentioned. ""It's too easy nowadays for consumers to tune out advertising. Consumers will always avoid commercial messages but they will seek out good content."" -- Miguel BernasA social brand story is therefore important -- as stories create possibilities, possibilities create dialogue, and dialogue facilitates connections. A dear friend and mentor, Antonio Lucio, extended this musing of mine -- he believed that when such connections are anchored in shared purpose, they can be translated into action. 1. Be Relevant A good social brand story is an ecosystem of listening and constructive iterations.Today's brands are open books where there is no single author of the respective brand story. While the brand can try writing the narrative on its own, it is up to the brand's consumers to embrace, alter, or reject the brand's messaging. Today's social brand story and how it portrays itself through outward communications is written together with the consumer -- and it is an ongoing process. Social content never guns for brand-led perfection. Social content embraces listening and feedback from the crowd. Social content is all about iteration, and using consistent feedback for improvement. ""We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak."" -- Epictetus, Greek PhilosopherBrands need to listen to create value-added content. It's a continuous dialogue which they use to improve their content, and gain the trust of their consumers in the process.Instead of making a one-sided, solely brand-led decision, SingTel decided to listen and encourage participation from their online communities. Prior to the launch of the first season of TGIS, SingTel held a Casting Call in 2011 in search for a resident host for TGIS -- a host who is personable, technology savvy, and suitably engaging on-screen. The initial judging had ladies from SingTel's online communities submitting short video entries, which were posted on SingTel's Facebook page, of why they wanted to be groomed to be the resident host for TGIS. Eventually, after two rounds of judging, Joanne-Marie Sim, a Singaporean blogger, edged out more than 350 hopefuls to be the resident host for TGIS.Joanne-Marie Sim, Host of TGIS""We didn't want a local celebrity or a recognizable face to host TGIS. We wanted someone who could represent the audience, which was why we opted for public auditions instead of turning to the talent agencies."" -- Miguel BernasIt paid off handsomely for the SingTel team. On average, 90 percent of its online audience watched through 75 percent of the episodes. By the end of season in May 2012, the series attracted more than half a million views. Of notable mention as well is Singtel's other forays into different video series that are not necessarily technology- or product-led. Home Without Walls is a commendable initiative by Singtel that celebrates the enduring spirit of friendship and kinship through candid interview vignettes, weaving in motifs of love, tradition, and dreams despite contrasting factors such as age and personality. 2. Be ContagiousA good social brand story resonates by being unpredictable, getting the attention of tastemakers, and is told on the right medium.You know that ""viral"" has officially become part of the marketing lexicon when it's no longer just referred to the pervasiveness of the common flu. I have lost track of how many times clients have asked on how to make social content be ""guaranteed viral."" In fact, that question must be one of the worst questions you can ever ask a marketer! But really, why does some social content resonate better than others? Why do some stories spread like wildfire on the internet and become a brand's dream come true? Contagious social content can be dissected into three key tenets -- community, content, and medium. For social content to catch on and get more contagious, it needs to attract the attention of tastemakers and influencers, and stand out in the swarm of content one consumes online every day. For it to stand out in the first place, such social content has to be unpredictable, aim to surprise, and be unanticipated by the crowd. Realistically speaking, however, one can never consistently anticipate to be unexpected. It is a better bet to tailor content to be relevant and resonate with the intended audience. The medium in which this content is produced is also important, as it affects how fast it is shared, and how identical these shares are to the original source. Richard Dawkins, the father of memetics, discussed this in 1976 in The Selfish Gene, and referred to this as fecundity -- declaring that the medium in which ""content"" gets shared is important -- as the faster it produces, the more successful it will be. It is thus not surprising that the best and most contagious social content are largely visual -- either photos or videos. According to M Booth and Simply Measured, videos are shared 12 times more than links and posts combined on Facebook. Photos are liked two times more than text updates on Facebook as well. On YouTube, more than 100 million users are taking a social action on videos every week. ""In the age when consumers can pick and choose what kind of content they want, where it's so easy to tune out content they dislike, our challenge is to offer content that's of real value. That's what TGIS promises to offer."" --Miguel BernasOne particular TGIS episode, ""How to Save a Wet Phone,"" for example, was certainly unexpected content from what was seen to be a traditional telco. The episode featured the resident host, in an eye-catching swimsuit, jumping into a pool to ""save"" a mobile phone, and later debunking common myths of how to restore a phone that was immersed in water. When the episode was published on Singtel's YouTube channel and Facebook page, It was shared repeatedly by the community, and became a talking point in the Singaporean digital space for a week. Currently, the video has registered a total of 420,000 views, making as one of the most popular videos a local company has ever produced in Singapore. But it's not all about swimsuits -- a TGIS episode featuring a drop test for a Nokia Lumia smartphone garnered more than 94,000 views.Are you ready to start crafting your social brand story? ""Consumers are constantly connected, whether to share opinions on social networks or consume content on sites like Youtube. SingTel has recognized this growing behavior and wants to where our consumers are."" -- Miguel BernasThe customer-centric thoughts from Miguel were well-put and encouraging as SingTel continues to write their social brand story. Social brands that do well on social media understand the importance of focusing more on the ""social"" -- the people, instead of the ""media"" in social media. Social brand stories that excel are ones which are able to engage the social consumer into its ecosystem and demonstrate the brand experience it has to offer. Ultimately, the hallmark of a good social brand story is written when the social consumer is at the heart of the brand experience. Author's Note: I was on the judging panel for SingTel's Casting Call in search for their YouTube Channel Host in 2011, and was subsequently invited to attend engagement sessions with their great social media team upon their re-launch of TGIS (Thank Goodness It's SingTel), a bi-weekly lifestyle series on their YouTube channel, in 2012."

The company has also been engaged in protracted talks in San Francisco with local authorities who insist that Airbnb renters pay a hotel tax.Last year, the company hauled in a $110 million investment round from venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst Partners with an implied valuation of more than $1 billion.Thiel, a Facebook director, made headlines in August when he cashed out most of his Facebook stake, netting roughly $400 million.Airbnb and a spokesman for Thiel both declined comment Friday afternoon.(Reporting By Gerry Shih; Editing by Bob Burgdorfer, Bernard Orr)"
