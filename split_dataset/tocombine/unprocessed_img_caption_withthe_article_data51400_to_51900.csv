Erdogan, whose alliance with the Gülen movement ruptured in 2013, demanded on Saturday that Washington hand over the cleric. Additional comments from Turkish officials suggested that Gülen’s residence in the U.S. could pose a threat to relations between the two countries.“I do not think any country would support [Gülen], the leader of a terrorist organization. Countries standing by this person will not be a friend of Turkey,” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said at a press conference in Ankara, in a clear reference to the U.S.Gülen strongly denied any role in the uprising against Erdogan’s government. “As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations,” he said in a statement distributed by the Alliance for Shared Values, a U.S.-based nonprofit connected to the movement.Speaking to reporters in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Gülen suggested the coup may have been staged, Reuters reported.It’s an inconvenient time for a flare-up in the already strained U.S.-Turkey relationship. Cooperation between the two countries appeared to be on the rise after the Islamic State militant group attacked Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport last month, said Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.“This is going to become a major sticking point in bilateral ties,” Cagaptay said. “Washington does not want a problem to arise right now, but it has risen.” Erdogan, who himself was once allied with the religious Gülen movement, has waged a campaign to purge its members from all levels of government since their alliance broke down in 2013. Washington has rebuffed past calls from Ankara to turn over Gülen, citing a lack of evidence that he was guilty of wrongdoing. It’s likely that Erdogan’s government will now step up the effort to present evidence against the cleric, putting the U.S. in a difficult position with an ally that currently hosts U.S. troops operating the air war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking to reporters in Luxembourg, said the State Department had yet to receive an extradition request from Turkey for Gülen. The Associated Press later reported that Erdogan was demanding the U.S. turn over Gülen, although it’s not clear whether he has filed a formal request.Kerry invited the Turkish government to present evidence of Gülen’s involvement in the coup attempt that “withstands scrutiny.” A State Department official declined to elaborate on how the U.S. would go about determining whether the evidence would warrant sending the cleric back to Turkey, where it is almost certain that he would face harsh punishment.Turkey abolished the death penalty over a decade ago as a condition of ascension talks with the European Union, but Yildirim hinted on Saturday that the government was considering reinstating the policy. “As is known, capital punishment has been abolished in the Turkish legal system. Today, our parliament will convene and we will discuss with other parties the additional measures or legal arrangements that should be put in place to prevent crazy attempts of this kind in the future,” the prime minister said, adding that those responsible for the uprising “are more despicable than the PKK terrorist organization.”Because the Gülen movement is an opaque group whose members don’t identify themselves publicly, it is difficult to gauge the size of their presence in Turkey, much less within specific government or military institutions. A former member of the Turkish Foreign Service, Sinan Ulgen, estimated that Gülenists account for 1 to 2 percent of the population, but some reports estimate that it is closer to 10 percent. There’s an “obvious risk” that the government will indiscriminately target people it suspects of being affiliated with the Gülen movement based on limited evidence, Ulgen said, referring to the precedent of the 2014 crackdown against the group.“The government has not particularly followed the rule of law, believing that the ends justified the means,” he said.Already, the government has arrested more than 2,800 people, though it is unclear what ties, if any, those people have to the Gülen movement or this week’s uprising.Gülenist involvement in the attempted coup that began Friday night is, at this point, still only a matter of speculation. Experts are divided on whether the government’s allegations are likely to be true. “The one institution that is quite impervious to the Gülen movement is the military,” Henri Barkey, director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, told The WorldPost on Friday. But Ulgen had a different view.“Given that there were already accounts that military was getting ready for large-scale purge within its ranks, I think it is fair to say that there is indeed Gülenist activity within the military ranks that potentially may have been part of this coup attempt,” said Ulgen, who is now a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe. “I think it would be a fair assessment to state that Gülenists were at least part of it ― if not exclusively responsible.” "

2,QUEER VOICES,"Chris Colfer Praises Clinton, Blasts Trump As A 'Click Hole'",Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-colfer-hillary-clinton_us_578904f3e4b03fc3ee50922f,"""I think she’s quite extraordinary,” the ""Glee"" star said.",2016-07-16,"""I remember as a kid secretly looking up to her,"" Colfer said of Hillary Clinton",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57895e8219000026008a6866.jpeg?cache=n96PdiFtu8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Glee” star Chris Colfer is reveling in his role as an author, just releasing the fifth installment of his hugely popular fantasy series, The Land of Stories (This one is titled An Author’s Odyssey). And he’s excited about what he describes as the “closest thing to going to the homeland”: having a role in “Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,” due out in the U.S next week.But Colfer, 26, is also currently energized by the presidential election. He’s helping to turn out the vote and raise money for Hillary Clinton, whom he’s looked up to and supported for many years. He even surprised her by showing up at one of her book signings in 2014.“Being a child in the ‘90s, I grew up in a very conservative household,” he told me in an interview on SiriusXM Progress. “All of my family were Republican — they’re still Republican. Our dinner table arguments should be filmed, because they’re so hysterical. She was constantly on the news for being ambitious. I remember even as a kid people were labeling her as, ‘How dare this first lady be ambitious?’ like it was a negative quality. And I remember seeing how many times she was publicly told, ‘No, you can’t do that. No, no, no.’ And she always said, “Yes, and…Yes, and…’ I remember as a kid secretly looking up to her. I think she’s quite extraordinary.”Colfer is, however, reticent when it comes to speaking about Donald Trump, simply because he thinks the GOP candidate just gets too much attention.“If I’m gonna have a voice politically, I want it to be positivity for Hillary,” he explained. “I don’t want it to be negativity for Donald Trump. Because I feel like people get trapped in that. As soon as you say something negative about Trump that’s all that people post, that’s all that people write. Because he’s a click hole.”Colfer, an openly gay actor who played the openly gay Kurt Hummel on the groundbreaking “Glee,” also weighed in on how much things have changed in the seven years since the musical TV series first aired. “The world has changed so much during that time,” he said. “And when I first started, actors were told, ‘Do not come out of the closet if you want to have a career. Keep it to yourself. You don’t make it known.’ The world has changed so much ― it’s strange to think of the mindset that I was in pre-‘Glee,’ pre-’Modern Family,’ pre-marriage equality.”"

Like any good New Englander, change does not come easily and I didn't imagine that this experience could be replicated - anywhere. That is until I discovered Caramoor.Come to find out, New Yorkers don't have to travel three hours for an idyllic combination of music, setting, and stars. Caramoor, New York's premier summer music festival, offers everything that is enjoyed at Tanglewood - world-class music with some of the world's leading performers, a stunning physical environment, and of course, beautiful night skies - and all without the Berkshires commute. Caramoor Music Festival (with programming this summer from mid-June through the end of August) resides at the historic Westchester Rosen estate in Katonah, NY, just sixty minutes (fifty miles) from Manhattan by car or public transportation. This short commute offers a thrilling payoff. Soprano Georgia Jarman sings Zenobia in Rossini's Aureliano in Palmira, Photo provided by Caramoor.Caramoor is the summer home of New York City's Orchestra of St. Luke's, which anchors much of its programming. It also hosts the Bel Canto Young Artists program, and in conjunction with these two institutions, this weekend Caramoor presents an exciting production of Rossini's rarely-performed work Aureliano in Palmira. Tenor Andrew Owens and sopranos Georgia Jarman and Tamara Mumford (who appears at the Met this season in Anna Bolena) sing in this early Rossini work that has been rarely heard since its 1813 La Scalla premier. Caramoor's Director of Opera Will Crutchfield has been instrumental in reassembling the score which was 'shred' by the composer after its initial rocky debut. This is a fine cast in a performance of a lost bel canto work that could enter the standard repertoire of opera houses. Go to Caramoor and be the first to rediscover. Pacifica Quartet, Photo provided by Caramoor.Also at Carmoor next week, Pacifica Quartet returns with an interesting chamber music program that includes two Beethoven works and a piece by Shulamit Ran, String Quartet No. 3: Glitter, Shards, Doom, Memory. Pacifica Quartet is known for daring repertoire and its exuberant performance style. The ensemble has been in residence at NYC's 92nd Street Y and Boston's Isabella Steward Gardner Museum.And later in the week, Caramoor's Bel Canto Young Artists program offers Beethoven in Song, a look at Beethoven's vocal output and a preview of Caramoor's concert production of Fidelio. Chick Corea Trio, Photo provided by Caramoor.Caramoor hosts an important day of jazz each summer, and on Saturday July 23rd, the Chick Corea Trio anchors the Caramoor Jazz Festival with his show, ""75 Years of Jazz Piano"" at 8pm. Corea is joined by Christian McBride and Brian Blade. Earlier in the day (gates open at 11am) Catherine Russell, Brianna Thomas and Charanée Wade sing blues. Caramoor Jazz Festival is particularly know for spotting up and comers, and this year feature trumpeter Etienne Charles and his Creole Soul Band, saxophonist Bria Skonberg, harpist Brandee Younger, and the Harlem Stride Piano Hour.Tickets for Caramoor Jazz Festival are available here in ZEALnyc's Shop.Pianist Jeremy Denk appears at Caramoor on Sunday, July 24th.

At a time when Americans are wrestling with deep divisions of all kinds,, 51 percent of the population has just been foolishly ignored.It's been exactly a century since the first woman was elected to Congress: Republican Jeanette Rankin of Montana. Today, women number just 19 percent in the House. (Tiny Rwanda is first in the world, with 64 percent of lower chamber seats held by women - who, by the way, have been leaders in that nation's rebirth since the 1994 genocide.)Democrats have been way ahead of Republicans in electing women to high office in this country since the 1990s. Female Dems outnumber Republicans by a three-to-one margin. The Congressional gender imbalance probably won't change much in November. The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers says 15 Democratic women are in the running for Senate seats compared with seven Republicans. On the House side, 138 Democrats are still in races, yet just 64 from the GOP are running. Sure, many of us advocating gender parity are cheering the prospect of Hillary's joining Theresa May in Britain and Angela Merkel in Germany, at the helm of three of the world's most powerful countries. But it's cool comfort when we look at the obstacles blocking women from Congress - structural, financial, and personal.Incumbency may be the most enormous barrier. Incredibly, some 88 percent of office holders are regularly reelected, thanks to their built-in fundraising muscle. When the huge majority of incumbents are men, women are essentially shut out. Republican women have an especially hard time reaching financiers and other power-brokers. Meanwhile, Democrats get a tremendous boost from the political action group EMILY's List. After all, ""Early Money Is Like Yeast.""But once women do break through, the gains are lasting. We've seen the long Senate tenure of Republican Susan Collins and Democrats Barbara Mikulski, Dianne Feinstein, and Barbara Boxer. (Boxer is retiring, but California's duet is likely to continue: Kamala Harris is expected to succeed her.)Democratic women in Congress have reached critical mass -- and they're critical actors. Why does this matter? For one thing, when women help lead a governing body, the culture changes. As Senator Mikulski says, ""We work on macro issues and macaroni and cheese issues."" For Republican women, problems start in the primaries, thanks to too little mentorship, minimal early funding, and the assumption that they're not conservative enough. Facing these hurdles, many pragmatic GOP women don't bother to compete. The one area they do show progress is at the state legislative level, where the party has seriously invested in growing the base of young female candidates.Especially if the Republican Party suffers major losses this year, the post-mortem should address not only diversity writ large but also strategies for getting women in their ""pipeline"" to move up.Why do I as an ardent Democrat care about the other party? The short answer is I want our country to work. Dozens of women in Congress have told me stories of how they reach across the aisle. An example: Three years ago, women forged a Senate compromise just days before we were going to plunge off the fiscal cliff. Sen. John McCain wondered aloud how much the Senate could get done if it were 50 percent female.  Women who want to go to Washington need path pavers, not wall builders. Mr. Trump has blown his huge opportunity. The rest of us don't have to. Swanee Hunt founded Political Parity, a program advancing women's leadership in the United States.

5,BUSINESS,3 Legal Mistakes Every Businesses Should Avoid,"William Morrow, ContributorMotivational Speaker, Blogger, Entrepreneur, Freelance Writer.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-legal-mistakes-every-bu_b_11035120.html,"In order to reduce your potential of contributing to the penalty-based revenue businesses generate for the US government, the following are legal mistakes you should avoid at all costs.",2016-07-16,2016-07-16-1468706567-3371640-BusinessMistakes.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-16-1468706567-3371640-BusinessMistakes-thumb.jpg,"Image Source Running a business is like running a marathon. You have the law, the government, and the competition all eagerly expecting you to make a mistake. Unlike in the marathon, any mistake you make cannot be forgiven. That being said, many of the mistakes businesses make are usually due to negligence and ignorance. Notwithstanding the intent behind these mistakes, you can be made to pay a huge price for committing them. However, nothing can hurt your business as much as running afoul of the law in the process of running your business. Small business owners can pay the hardest for legal mistakes. This might be because of their small profit margin compared to their overhead. However, it's to be noted that small businesses are the largest driver of revenue for the US government. A 2010 research puts the contributions of small businesses to the private nonfarm GDP at 46%, based on a 2008 findings -- the most recent one backed with data.There are roughly 29 million businesses in the US alone, and roughly 18,000 firms that employ over 500 workers. Is taxation the only way by which the US government generate funds from these businesses? You will agree that's not true. Fines make a huge proportion of the source of revenue to the government.In order to reduce your potential of contributing to the penalty-based revenue businesses generate for the US government, the following are legal mistakes you should avoid at all costs. Improper Tax Fillings  Taxes are how the governments make the bulk of their money. Businesses and individuals are obligated to give up a percentage of their income or revenue to the government. Failure or inconsistencies in this regard can lead to having the feds look into your accounts. The consequences of this itself can have a setback on your business.According to San Diego criminal lawyer, Vik Monder, dealing with financial related offences could be treated as criminal charges. Most tax offences are often treated as fraud. To avoid having to deal with fraud charges, which on its own can be expensive to fight, taking the time to put your tax filings and paperwork straight is crucial.Hiring Employees with Current Legal Issues Apart from battling with the law on your own, you want to avoid having your employees wrestling with the law. The law may be against discriminating against people on account of their past, but issues they're currently dealing with will have an impact on your business. A more supportive way is to provide assistance to see that the affected person -- if this is important to you -- gets through their legal storm successfully. Businesses have been known to hire employees only to fire them later after discovering about their current or past legal issues. This kind of situation creates unnecessary setbacks for a business.The best way to avoid finding yourself in such a situation is to do some findings on people before hiring them to join your business.Running Your Business without Involving Legal Experts While most small businesses may not be able to afford the luxury of having an attorney on their pay role, involving a legal expert in the legal-related dealings of your business is a must. Consulting a lawyer before making business decisions that have legal ramifications will help you prevent getting into trouble with the law. It's also beneficial when it involves entering into business partnerships with others.For instance, when you're required to sign an agreement before you're to enter into a type of partnership, you should always consult your lawyer for clarity on the content of the agreement before you sign it."

Ron was driving and had to pull over just so we could relish the moment. We both worked so hard on this film, for almost five years; it felt incredible to have it recognized with such a great honor!""That's filmmaker, Louise Amandes, sharing the moment she found out Bezango, WA, her documentary feature made with producing/directing partner, Ron Austin, had been selected for exhibition by the prestigious San Diego Comic-Con. As any independent filmmaker knows, these are the moments, rare and wonderful, that can truly change the trajectory of one's career, of one's project; bringing it to an audience it might not have found otherwise; allowing it to be discovered in an artistic field of thousands of offerings. Simply put, it can be life-changing. When I started blogging several years ago, one of my missions was to use the platform I had to shine whenever light I could on the artists, the projects, the smaller, more independent endeavors, that often get lost in the sea of art and craft available in our burgeoning marketplace. Bezango, WA, and Louise Amandes, seemed perfect candidates, so I sat down with her to get a bit more perspective on her and this unique project. A feature-length documentary, Bezango, WA, focuses on an eclectic and vibrant community of Seattle-area cartoonists, sharing their wide gamut of artistic styles and sensibilities, along with glimpses into individual philosophies, creative processes, even the struggles inherent in making art while attempting to make a living.An eclectic artist herself, Louise knows a little something about both the joy and struggle of the artist's life. Throughout a long and colorful career, she's worked as a screenwriter and songwriter, improv actor, drummer; talented graphic artist and web designer, along with her ""day job"" as a sought-after Seattle massage therapist (she was the on-set consultant for director/writer Lynn Shelton's film, Touchy Feely, starring Rosemarie DeWitt and Ellen Page). With such a diverse background herself, it's not hard to picture her finding affinity with artists in the cartooning community, many of whom she met, along with creative partner, Ron Austin, while studying animation and motion graphics.   My first question, Louise, is how did you and Ron come to work together, and how did you arrive at the idea of doing a documentary on ""Seattle cartoonists""?Ron and I made a few short films together early on, and when it came time to decide on our next film, he had the idea of focusing on the cartoonists and comic artists of the Seattle area, where we are both based. Ron has been part of the cartooning community here for many years; he's dabbled in cartooning himself, and was involved in the cartoon group, Cartoonists Northwest, so he knew there was a rich assortment of stories to tell about this particular genre of artist.  But neither one of us had any idea how to actually tackle the subject, even whether to make a feature film or create a web series. We decided to start by interviewing a few cartoonists and see where it evolved from there. We originally had a select group we were talking to and thought about focusing the project largely on them, but as word got out about what we were doing, more and more people started recommending we interview this person or that person. We came to discover there was this vast community of extremely talented artists here, who support and inspire each other through all kinds of events and collaborations, and we quickly realized this community was the heart of the story. One can really sense, while watching the film, how much you respect and admire both the creativity and the struggles these people experience in making art in a challenging market.That's true. As artists ourselves, particularly indie artists with our own set of challenges, Ron and I wanted to highlight these incredibly talented people who never stop doing their art despite the struggles of living in an area like Seattle, which has become a very expensive place to live, and working in a field that's highly competitive and not always lucrative. Our goal with Bezango, WA was to honor that commitment to their work, and reflect just how real and ""down home,"" in a way, these artists are despite those struggles. Independent films come with inherent challenges for any production team, particularly given the lower budgets and limited production personnel. While it's not common for a creative team to both wear the hats of ""producer"" and ""director,"" the success of Bezango, WA makes clear that you and your partner figured it out!   Can you give us an idea of how you two divvied up the production and creative tasks during the years of putting the film together? We both had our hands in every element of making the film. Ron was the chief financial contributor and I was in charge of production. In the beginning, Ron did a lot of the cinematography, while I set up the interviews and staged the shots, setting up the lighting and audio. At first I didn't even know how to use the DSLR camera, but over time I got a handle on it, and we ended up filming with two cameras for each interview... giving us a much better selection of shots to choose from. As we moved into post-production, I did a larger percentage of the editing, as well as setting up the music for Brian Cobb to create, and working closely with Andrew Lloyd, our sound editor. Ron also had a hand in the editing, music, and sound, but the bulk of that was done by me to balance out his financial contribution.Your respect and affinity for this particular community is evident in every frame of the film, from the stunning ""beauty shots"" of the Pacific Northwest, to the intimate and revealing conversations with individual artists. The vulnerability and openness of many, the shared stories and candid perspectives offered, give testament to their commensurate respect for the celebratory intent of the film, making it a mutual admiration event! Tell me, what are the reactions Bezango, WA is inspiring, and what do you most hope people get out of it? The reviews, both personal and editorial, have largely been positive. People have let us know how much they enjoyed learning about this group of artists, learning about this industry that so many had no idea existed. Some feedback suggested we'd included too many artists in the original edit, so we took a look at that and have edited it down since the original screenings. But for those interested, the original, full-length version of the film will be the one screened at San Diego Comic-Con. As for what I hope people get out of it: It was really important to Ron and me to use our medium to educate the world about these artists, their art, and their struggles. I hope, after viewing the film, that people have a better understanding of this community, and will support these great artists who work so hard to put out amazing work, especially those from the area we feature. One of the best comments I continue to hear from people is that they feel we've educated them about a community they had no idea existed, one they will now definitely support by buying more graphic novels and comic books. I know you've done a number of screenings at various film festivals and regional events since the film's completion, but getting selected for the San Diego Comic-Con is quite a prestigious honor, one, I hope, that vaults the film, and you as filmmakers, into the next stratosphere. Having seen and enjoyed your documentary immensely, I very much agree that it offers unique insight into a very specialized art form, one which I had little knowledge of up till now, while revealing the universal struggle that exists with artists of many mediums. It's a both wonderful testament to, and a window into, the world of the talented group you feature. I encourage audiences and appreciators of art to grab a badge and get to the screening.   Speaking of which, how can readers see the film this coming week at Comic-Con? People with Comic-Con badges can see the film on Friday, July 22nd, at 11:05 am PST-12:50 pm PST. It will be screened in Pacific Ballroom 23 on the , 1st floor of the Marriott Marquis right next to the Convention Center. There will be a Q &A after the film with Ron and I, which will also include Frank M. Young, David Lasky, and Pat Moriarity, who are featured artists in the film. Thanks, Louise, for sharing a bit about your documentary. I have no doubt Comic-Con attendees will find it as inspiring as I did. I wish you and Ron all the best with its continued rollout, and look forward to seeing what's next from you.You're welcome, and thanks for helping get the word out. Every independent artist knows -- including me! -- that our task is to find the balance in creating great work, getting it seen, heard, and appreciated, and, at the same time, assuring one's survival and forward motion. Which makes me all the more honored to have our little film selected for this event. I'm looking forward to the feedback and excitement it will bring to our artists, our film, and to us as filmmakers. We're happy to be included and hope to see lots of you there!

The film premieres on July 16th at OUTFEST in LA. #milesthemovie , #OutfestLA Tim Boardman's Twitter, Instagram. Photo by Spencer Kohn.Now Tim Boardman is my type of lad. You know why, don't you, readers? (wink wink)Tim lost his brand new sunglasses last week JUST as he was heading to LaLa Land for the premiere of his film, Miles, which is being presented at #OutfestLA . Tim, I hope you got another pair of sunglasses because I'm told they are a commodity in LA!It's hard to focus when I'm looking at Tim's picture so you may notice I'm all over the place in this intro. I'm not sorry. And what would an article by me be without a connection to ""V""? The premiere of Miles is July 16th, same day as ""V"" actress Faye Grant's birthday.Miles centers on a young gay man who discovers his recently deceased father has squandered his tuition fund in an illicit affair. He joins the girls' volleyball team in his small town to win a college scholarship.Let's find out more about Tim Boardman!You play the title character in the Nathan Adloff-directed indie MILES. How'd you get the part?I auditioned. The process was actually very interesting because I was cast all off of self-tapes. Nathan was in LA, I was in NY. I didn't meet any of the team in person until a week or two before shooting began.What initially drew you to this project?There are so many different life lessons / issues in this film that it's hard not to relate to something in this story, no matter who you are. Miles reminded me so much of myself in terms of fighting for something I felt passionately about and not always having that genuine support from other people and the struggle of dealing with that. I lost track of how many times I read the script.Tell us about your first meeting with Molly Shannon and Paul Reiser, who also star in the film?We didn't have any prior meetings to shooting, so I actually didn't meet them till the first day we filmed our scenes together. We had such a short time to connect and get to know each other, so we just immediately opened up and hit it off right away. They really took me under their wing and are truly amazing, welcoming and talented individuals.Your character, Miles, is an openly gay 17 year old who is comfortable in his own skin. How important do you think it is to have positive roles portrayed in film and TV? What do you think people will learn from your character and or the messaging of the film?I think it's very important to have positive roles portrayed in film and TV. What I love about this story that's different from a lot of other LGBT films, is yes he's gay, but that's not what the story is about. It's about fighting for what you believe and what you think is right. Yes, any great film has obstacles, but when it's constantly negative it doesn't always leave you as the viewer feeling the greatest. That's why having a positive figure like Miles, despite his struggles, will definitely resonate with audiences and give them inspiration to achieve what they deem to be impossible.You're heading to LA for the premiere of Miles at OUTFEST on July 16th. What are you most excited about with regards to premiering MILES at such a reputable festival?I'm honestly just excited to meet other filmmakers and actors who love this craft just as much as I do. And to take part in a festival that celebrates opportunity and the arts.You will also be seen in the 2017 comedy Wilde Wedding opposite Glenn Close, John Malkovich, Patrick Stewart, Peter Facinelli, and Minnie Driver. Can you tell us a bit about your role? What was it like to be part of such a star-studded cast? Any fun stories from set?I play a character named Dylan who is the nephew of Glenn Close's character. I am one of several members in this large ensemble cast. I would describe my character as slightly awkward and nerdy, but good looking yet he doesn't know it. Overall, it was an absolute honor to work alongside these Hollywood legends. These are the kind of people I look up to and to be able to work with them for a month was unreal. They were such a fun and friendly group. My favorite memory from set was when we shot one scene over the course of two overnight shoots. We had the majority of the cast together filled with lots of positivity and laughter despite the late hours.You are originally from CT but now live in Brooklyn. What is a typical day look like for Tim Boardman in Brooklyn?It varies day to day. Some days I have auditions, others I don't. I like to work out and go to the gym when I'm not auditioning or working on a script, so I try and do that about five days out of the week. I also keep up with my training by taking acting classes, voice lessons and dance classes as I have a background in Musical Theater. I also take like to take a nap at least once a day if I can.Anything else you'd like to say?Look out for Miles! If you're in the area come to Outfest and get in the standby line at the Director's Guild of America! Screening Saturday, July 16th at 2:30pm. #LGBTQ"

The man had not traveled outside of the United States in the prior year.The woman developed fever, fatigue, a rash and body aches the next day, and sought treatment. Health department officials then confirmed her infection.When her male partner developed symptoms seven days later and sought treatment from the same caregiver, he, too, was diagnosed with Zika.Health officials from New York reported the case in the CDC’s weekly report on death and disease. They said the timing and sequence of events support female-to-male Zika virus transmission through unprotected vaginal sex.The CDC said it recommends that all pregnant women who have a sex partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with Zika use barrier methods such as a condom every time they have sex, or they should not have sex during the pregnancy. Although no cases of woman-to-woman Zika transmission have been reported, these recommendations now also apply to female sex partners of pregnant women.CDC said it is updating recommendations for sexually active people in which the couple is not pregnant or concerned about pregnancy and for people who want to reduce personal risk of Zika infection through sex.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Jonathan Oatis)"

11,POLITICS,Can You Imagine Donald Trump Hosting A Town Hall On Race In America?,Nick Wing and Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-race-town-hall_us_578951e0e4b03fc3ee50f394,"Yes, this is something we really have to think about.",2016-07-15,Picture known racist Donald Trump talking about race in America.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578951ff2400002600b31722.jpeg?cache=VCf6W40yFL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Thursday, President Barack Obama held a “National Conversation” on race, and even though it left much to be desired, his comments about policing and the black community start to look a little better when you consider who might take his place in the White House come January. Imagine an America in which Donald Trump, the current presumptive GOP nominee, is president. That America, like this one, will struggle with longstanding problems of racism and police departments that routinely abuse their power in black communities. In an effort to smooth over the tension, imagine the (admittedly unlikely) scenario in which President Trump agrees to host a town hall discussion where he’ll field questions from family members of black men and women who were slain by members of law enforcement.That’s the mission Obama embarked upon last night, all while trying to balance his role as leader of 320 million Americans ― including plenty of racist white people ― and his own experiences as a black man in America. It disappointed a number of activists, who say Obama missed an opportunity to more candidly and aggressively address anti-black racism.The whole event was the latest instance of Obama, the first black president, taking on the nearly impossible role of a racial healer. He tried, and even if he ultimately failed to move the needle last night, that could be more than we’ll ever be able to say for his successor.Seriously, can you picture Donald Trump taking a shot at this? Imagine, if you will, a dialogue that goes something like this:Audience member: What are you going to do to stop police violence?Scary.Even Trump understands that this wouldn’t go well, which is why he would likely avoid taking on the issue entirely. He is not a “racial healer,” despite what his surrogates say. “The blacks” don’t love Trump. A recent poll of black swing-state voters showed him getting literally zero percent support. Zilch.Trump’s base trends older, whiter, more male. He’s become a figurehead for the very people most responsible for sowing racial resentment in the U.S. over the past few generations. And while Obama regularly faces accusations from people who think even his most mild-mannered, even-handed comments about race in America are dividing us, we can’t help but wonder how a Trumpian approach would be more effective.Whatever you think about how Obama tackles these difficult discussions about race, we shouldn’t take for granted the ambition of his attempts. We may not see anything like them for a while with a President Trump ― or even a President Clinton ― in office.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "

But whether the allegations of former students now suing Trump University are true, it’s unlikely the company would have attracted as many customers without Trump’s brand name and its “university” tag.Now, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and 11 other progressive senators want regulators to warn consumers about businesses posing as colleges or universities without proper certification. The senators wrote a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Education Department and the Federal Trade Commission asking the agencies to set up an online alert system that warns people about for-profit education scams before they get roped in.Regulators should “take immediate steps to warn consumers regarding unlicensed and potentially fraudulent universities,” the letter says. The lawmakers are also urging regulators to enforce existing laws to protect consumers. Their letter points out that in 2005, New York regulators told Trump University that the company was violating state law because it was not a chartered university. Nonetheless, the senators say, it took five years to get the company to stop marketing itself as a university. The senators are asking for a response by August 31.

Already.,2016-07-15,Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton is making speeches and appearing at events to raise his national profile.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578839fa1a000024006fa854.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― The 2016 election is four months away, but some prominent Republicans are already laying the groundwork for the 2020 presidential race.Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton are expected to address the delegations of three key early primary states ― Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina ― next week at the party’s convention in Cleveland. Both men will also deliver remarks on stage at Quicken Loans Arena on behalf of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, raising their profile in front of a national audience.Cotton, 39, is also headed to the early caucus state of Nevada later this summer to address the Second Annual Basque Fry, a popular gathering of GOP activists and community and state business leaders. Several would-be presidential candidates attended the inaugural Basque Fry in 2015.Cotton’s background as a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as his outspoken role on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would make him an attractive candidate.Potential candidates usually test the waters at events like the Basque Fry, where they have a chance to meet and impress potential supporters and donors.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is expected to speak at the GOP convention next week as well, but he does not have any visits scheduled with early state delegations. Cruz will, however, host a delegate “thank you event” for his supporters during the convention ― fueling speculation over his future ambitions. The conservative firebrand, who has not endorsed Trump, came closest to denying the brash businessman the nomination earlier this year by winning 559 delegates. Given his impressive grassroots operation, he would be well-positioned for a 2020 run should he decide to throw his hat into the ring once more.Though Cruz may be keeping his head down, his allies on the influential GOP Rules Committee, which met this week in Cleveland, made a play to change the rules governing future contests in the wake of Trump’s performance in the primary.Trump did better in “open” primary contests, where members of any party may cast a ballot, rather than in “closed” contests, where only registered Republicans can cast a ballot. Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who led Cruz’s delegate operation, and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a friend of the Texas senator, pushed for more “closed” primary contests. Their effort ultimately failed before the committee, but by a smaller-than-expected margin.Making the laying of groundwork by possible future contenders more than a little awkward, however, is the fact that Trump may yet win the White House ― and hence choose to run for re-election in 2020. The early jockeying is further indication of the party’s tepid confidence in their own nominee months before ballots are even cast in November."
15,TECH,Facebook Gives Pathetic Excuse For Its Diversity Problems,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-diversity-problems_us_5788efc1e4b03fc3ee5077b2,"""This is a f**king insult,"" one outspoken advocate of diversity in Silicon Valley said.",2016-07-15,Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during an interview in 2015. The company on Friday said it's struggling to find qualified candidates of color.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5788f0652400002700b31547.jpeg?cache=dJhHpBHR4e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook says it’s having trouble hiring people of color because public schools are failing to educate them properly.The company is 52 percent white, 38 percent Asian, 4 percent Hispanic and 2 percent black, according to diversity numbers released Thursday. Sixty-seven percent of Facebook employees are male overall.In a blog post about the data, Maxine Williams, Facebook’s global head of diversity, offered an excuse that belies the social network’s status as one of the most valuable and resource-rich companies in the entire world.“It has become clear that at the most fundamental level, appropriate representation in technology or any other industry will depend upon more people having the opportunity to gain necessary skills through the public education system,” Williams wrote.The so-called “pipeline” problem is a familiar argument, and it’s valid to an extent. It’s true that computer science isn’t a requirement in many public high schools, which theoretically means the populations most dependent on public education are less well-equipped to pursue engineering in college.Facebook’s blog post explains that minorities and females were less likely to take the College Board’s Advanced Placement exam in Computer Science, for example.“In 2015, seven states had fewer than 10 girls take the Advanced Placement Computer Science exam and no girls took the exam in three states,” Williams wrote.“No Black people took the exam in nine states including Mississippi where about 50% of high school graduates are Black, and 18 states had fewer than 10 Hispanics take the exam with another five states having no Hispanic AP Computer Science (CS) test takers,” she added.Then again, Facebook isn’t hiring high school students. And it also has a whole lot of jobs that have nothing to do with computer science. Those roles are also mostly occupied by white people, though the genders are close to balanced.Leslie Miley, director of engineering at Slack and an outspoken advocate of diversity in Silicon Valley, said in an interview with The Huffington Post on Friday that Facebook’s statement was a “fucking insult.”“You can quote me on that,” he added.Facebook has pledged to do better. Black representation in non-tech roles grew from 3 percent last year to 5 percent now. And the company is promising $15 million (or .004 percent of the company’s $336 billion market value today) to the nonprofit Code.org for computer science education over the next five years. Code.org has supplied training and resources to public schools for years, but it also offers unconventional online courses that anyone can access if, say, they aren’t in a position to take an AP test.“Are you going to make a commitment to hire from these programs?” Miley said. In response to Miley’s criticisms, a Facebook spokeswoman told HuffPost that the company aggressively markets its Facebook University program to colleges across the United States as a means to serve “underrepresented communities.” Facebook University is a sort of pre-internship program for students to enroll in after their freshman year of college, and it’s open to people without strong computer science backgrounds. It’s paid, with housing and meals provided by Facebook.The spokeswoman would not say how many students from Facebook University or the company’s other internship programs are ultimately hired full-time by the social network. But she said Facebook University has grown from 30 students to 170 in recent years.Still, Miley told HuffPost that the bottom line is that Facebook could easily find more people of color to hire if it wanted to ― it would just have to adjust how it recruits and values candidates. Facebook is free to hire whom it wants, but if diversity is a priority, as the company states, then it needs to change its formula.“Facebook is looking for people who are already like them, looking for students that they can turn into Facebook employees, and really denying the individuality that students of color can bring to the table,” Miley said.This article has been updated to include additional information from Facebook."

It was the last real opportunity for Republicans to deny Trump the presidential nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Republicans’ last realistic chance to deny Donald Trump their presidential nomination fizzled Thursday, as a key rules change proposal failed to get enough votes to reach the convention floor next week.Leaders of the Free the Delegates group needed 28 votes of the 112-member Convention Rules Committee to force the full Republican National Convention to consider their “conscience clause.”Instead, the most group leader and Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh could muster was about 21.“Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. There should be absolutely no question as to who we vote for,” said Arizona delegate Bruce Ash.How many votes Unruh had exactly isn’t known, because she failed to demand a recorded vote before the chairman ruled it closed. On a previous vote by Trump supporters to shut down debate on her proposal, the vote was 77-21.The vote followed weeks of a publicity campaign and lobbying effort by Unruh’s Free the Delegates and the supporting Delegates Unbound group. Unruh made her final appeal to her fellow 111 committee members, telling them her proposal restored their right to vote their conscience.“That is a God-given right that shouldn’t be taken away by the RNC or any state,” she said.When she began a public campaign to stop Trump last month, she had hoped for 57 votes, a majority. With that kind of backing, she believed she could have won over a majority of the 2,472 total delegates to support the rule, which in turn would have ended Trump’s chances.In the past couple of weeks, though, Unruh downgraded her goal to 28 votes, enough for a “minority report” from the Convention Rules Committee. That would have carried far less weight on the convention floor, but still would have guaranteed a floor vote.The Trump campaign and RNC leaders wanted to avoid a public display of internal party strife at the convention, which they hope instead to choreograph as a show of unity behind their nominee. They lobbied delegates to oppose Unruh and back Trump.Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a delegate and a Trump critic, pleaded with Trump to recognize why so many are uneasy with him and to do something to mend fences. “This angst isn’t going to go away just because we papered over it with rules,” Lee said. “I say to Mr. Trump, and those aligned with him, make the case to those delegates who want to have a voice.”It’s unclear whether Lee will get a response that offers him much comfort. At about the same time that Lee was speaking in committee late Thursday, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was sending this Tweet: “Anti-Trump people get crushed at Rules Committee. It was never in doubt: Convention will honor will of people & nominate @realdonaldtrump.”The “conscience clause” proposal was just one of dozens of rules changes the committee considered Thursday. The panel touched off hours of intrigue as it began by taking an hours-long break ― at first explained away as caused by a jammed printer, but eventually conceded as an attempt to cut a deal with some rules-change sponsors to save time.“Obviously we did not stand adjourned for three hours for a jammed copier,” committee chairwoman Enid Mickelsen said when the panel finally began its work after lunch.Those hours were spent trying to appease Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general and ally of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who pushed attempts to weaken the RNC chairman as well as to encourage states to restrict participation in primaries to keep out non-Republicans. Many conservative Republicans believe that independents and even Democrats have too much influence in choosing their nominee, thanks to open primaries.But Cuccinelli said that after a day and a half of negotiations, the deal fell apart. “The RNC pulled out of it,” he told reporters afterward, blaming the impasse on how many bonus delegates states that hold closed primaries would get.Cuccinelli wanted a 20 percent bonus, while the RNC came back with an offer of no higher than about 6 percent, he said. “They yanked it. They changed the numbers,” he said.RNC strategist Sean Spicer said the negotiations were far more complicated than that, involving a number of disparate issues. As to the bonus delegate number: “Ken Cuccinelli doesn’t get to decide,” Spicer said, adding that other stakeholders had different views.With the deal gone, the committee went through each of the elements of the proposed package one by one. Proposals to take away the power of the RNC to change its rules outside of a nominating convention and the ban on lobbyists took about an hour each. Both failed overwhelmingly.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Still, the network was so impressed by the Missouri native, who had devoted his adolescence to poring over Top 40 playlists and dissecting Michael Jackson, Madonna and Duran Duran videos with fervor, that executives opted to hire him anyway.Ever the pop culture aficionado, Holmes became a ubiquitous MTV presence over the next three years, hosting “Total Request Live,” “Say What? Karaoke” and a plethora of Spring Break-themed shows. From the outside, it seemed like a dream come true. The reality, of course, was much more complicated.“I thought that if I were ever able to just step into my dream life – and a job at MTV was absolutely my dream life – that it was going to fix everything for me,” Holmes, now 45, told The Huffington Post. “I thought that it would turn me into some idealized version of myself.

Collectively, they create a literary “mixtape,” if you will. In it, Holmes doesn’t shy away from discussing his early struggles with his sexuality as a closeted gay teen, often in a wry, self-effacing way. “To be a young gay kid is to work around the clock,” Holmes writes in one chapter, before a cheeky footnote clarifies: “In 1984 you could get called a faggot, and then the guy who said it to you would put his headphones back on and resume listening to Twisted Sister or Mötley Crüe or whatever other group of men in bustiers, fishnet stockings, and full faces of L’Oréal products he had been enjoying before he accused you of being gay for holding your books the wrong way.” While he admits to still being “a little self conscious” about his musical tastes, Holmes said many readers have already responded to his professed passion for the MTV days of yore.“If you grow up having that sort of weird, dull pain of not fitting in or not feeling like you belong or feeling like what you are is not what you’re being told you’re supposed to be, you tend to gravitate toward art, music, theater ― things where the emotions are heightened,” Holmes told HuffPost. “Popular culture is something we all share together, and people like to hear about it and talk about.”The book also delves into Holmes’ time at MTV, his public coming out in a 2002 Out magazine profile and his eventual move from New York to Los Angeles, where he now lives. In hindsight, he said that he wishes he’d addressed his sexuality sooner, possibly even during his time on the air at MTV, but feels it would’ve been problematic for a number of reasons.“I look back at the self that I was when I was 28 or 29, and I don’t know if that guy would’ve been the world’s best spokesperson,” Holmes, who was already out to friends, family and colleagues during his MTV stint, said. “I was still dealing with some sh*t back then, so maybe it’s for the better that I didn’t publicly make any sort of announcement until I was a little more secure.”These days, he said he’s the happiest he’s even been, having amassed a “really, really good group of gay friends” with whom he’s experiencing a “second adolescence” of sorts.“Many of our straight friends are settling down and having kids or are just moving out of L.A. and New York and into the suburbs, so that leaves a bunch of us who, at 45, hang out together and cause trouble,” he quipped. “In a lot of our cases, we didn’t really have our 20s. We were working things out when most people get out and carouse.”In Holmes’ case, that renewed vigor also means new music. Although the industry is a vastly different place than it was during his “TRL” run, he said he still loves discovering new tunes, naming recent albums by The Hold Steady, Fifth Harmony and Tegan and Sara as favorites. As grateful as he is to MTV for launching his career, he doesn’t watch much of the script-based programming that the network now favors. Criticizing that shift, he said, is “a bit like complaining that the clothes at Baby Gap don’t fit you – they’re not for you.” “It’s not for me, but it’s not supposed to be for me,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s my age or just the world we live in now, but I find it much harder to keep up with what’s going on. I don’t even understand how the Top 40 works anymore.”Still, he added, “I have to imagine that kids are still finding things that they love and that mean something to them.

19,MEDIA,White House Correspondents Association Struggles To Find Role In 2016 Election,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-correspondents-association-donald-trump_us_5788fd2ee4b08608d3343215,What to do when the biggest disputes over access have shifted from the briefing room to the campaign trail?,2016-07-15,The White House Correspondents Association has found itself in the unusual position of dealing with sustained campaign press controversies. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The White House Correspondents Association, as its name implies, is primarily concerned with press access to the White House. But the biggest media disputes this past year have occurred on the campaign trail, prompting the association, at times, to wade cautiously into controversies involving not the sitting president but the candidates trying to replace him. Its latest attempt to weigh in on behalf of journalists, however well-intentioned, led to a backlash among the press. Wall Street Journal reporter Carol Lee and Reuters’ Jeff Mason, the outgoing and incoming WHCA presidents, respectively, wrote a USA Today op-ed Thursday on 2016 campaign restrictions. To some journalists and media critics, the piece suggested the campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have approaches to the press that are similarly problematic.They are not. Clinton’s refusal to hold a news conference for more than seven months deserves criticism, and White House reporters should be concerned about the precedent being set. If elected president, would Clinton ever meet with the press?Still, the Trump campaign’s treatment of the press has been far more troubling, including onerous restrictions at events, gratuitous swipes at journalists, threats of opening libel laws, physical attacks and operating a media blacklist that is unprecedented in American politics.The framing of Lee and Mason’s piece, titled “Trump, Clinton both threaten free press,” was described by The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple as an “absurd false equivalence.”“On balance, though, Trump is a hazard to the media; Clinton runs from it,” Wemple wrote. “Veteran reporters like Lee and Mason are trained to draw such distinctions, yet they appear to believe that the concept of fairness requires a finding of equal culpability between the presidential contenders.”In a joint statement Friday, Lee and Mason pushed back against the criticism.“Our op-ed laid out legitimate and different concerns that we have about each candidate with regard to the press,” they wrote in the statement, published in full below. “We did not render a verdict on which candidate poses more of a problem; people can draw their own conclusions about that. To suggest that we were somehow presenting a ‘false equivalency’ misses our point.”In a normal election cycle, the occasional statement reiterating support for press freedom may have sufficed. But the Trump campaign’s severe restrictions have led some journalists to privately discuss whether collective action is needed. The problem is there’s no equivalent to the WHCA for campaign reporters, which puts the century-old organization in an unusual position. Does the WHCA stick with tradition and focus on the waning months of President Barack Obama’s administration, while only speaking out occasionally? Or does it intervene more forcefully given that one of these two presumptive nominees will be taking over in January?“The WHCA’s focus is access to the White House and the president,” Lee told HuffPost prior to Thursday’s op-ed. “While campaigns for the president matter, it’s not the president. And so there’s a little bit of a distance that’s been traditionally maintained. We’ve waded in when we felt that things were building up enough that it was useful for us to say something.”The WHCA’s first comment came in March in response to reports that Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, had physically assaulted reporter Michelle Fields. (Lewandowski was later fired by the campaign, and Fields now writes for The Huffington Post.)The WHCA condemned any “violence or intimidation” against journalists in response to the assault report and expressed being “increasingly concerned with some of the rhetoric aimed at reporters covering the presidential race.” The statement didn’t specify any campaign as being primarily responsible for the uptick in heated language. However, Trump, by far, has leveled the most personal attacks on reporters, whom he frequently labels “disgusting” at rallies.In June, the WHCA criticized the Trump campaign for denying press credentials to news outlets after The Washington Post ― a higher-profile outlet than others barred from events ― was added to the blacklist. The Trump campaign had already been denying credentials for nearly a year to other outlets, such as BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post. The WHCA’s sporadic public statements are its most visible responses this cycle, but its members do more behind the scenes too. The WHCA’s leadership keeps tabs on problems bubbling up at campaign events based on their own experiences and conversations with colleagues. And WHCA board members have traditionally met with campaigns of the major party nominees to advise them on coordinating a “protective pool” system by which a rotating pool of reporters cover the Republican and Democratic candidates each day, as is done for the sitting president.In May, Lee and Mason met privately with Trump press secretary Hope Hicks and Lewandowski. The conversation was pegged to arranging a pool, though Lee recently told HuffPost the WHCA representatives made clear to Trump’s team that the group doesn’t tolerate banning news outlets in the White House.Mason, who began his term this week, recently said over email that the group would be “watching the campaigns closely and will weigh in when we need to do so,” though reiterated the WHCA’s mission is to focus on the White House. “Our priority is to keep doing what we’ve been doing: press for access to the president and his staff on a daily basis as he closes out his administration,” he said.Some veteran White House reporters, such as CBS News’ Bill Plante, believe the WHCA should continue its mission to focus primarily on the White House, even as he’s troubled by the Trump campaign barring some news outlets from events.“The whole idea that you can ban reporters because you don’t like their coverage flies in the face of freedom of the press,” Plante said in a HuffPost interview this week. And if a Trump White House “were trying to ban a news organization from the White House briefing room because they didn’t like their coverage,” he added, “there would be a huge reaction I’m sure.” Still, Plante said he expected a Clinton White House, like its predecessors, to try getting around journalists. “Every administration, beginning with the Reagan administration, has tried to assert more and more control over the press,” he said. New York Times reporter Peter Baker, who has covered the last three presidents, also pointed out in an email that the WHCA’s mission has always been focused on the White House, “but over the years it has weighed in from time to time in trying to prod those who want to live in the White House to recognize the obligations of transparency that come with the job.”“Should it take that on in a more fulsome, comprehensive way? It’s worth debating,” Baker said. “You could argue it’s better that we make our expectations and views known earlier in the process rather than just wait until someone shows up at our door on January 20 every four years. But keep in mind that many if not most of the reporters covering the campaign don’t belong to the association, so it would require rethinking our membership and who we aim to serve.”The full statement from the WHCA’s Lee and Mason is below:The White House Correspondents’ Association defends the First Amendment in the context of the presidency, and, as such, speaks up when a presumptive nominee from either party falls short. Our op-ed laid out legitimate and different concerns that we have about each candidate with regard to the press. We did not render a verdict on which candidate poses more of a problem; people can draw their own conclusions about that. To suggest that we were somehow presenting a “false equivalency” misses our point."

Reid Ribble (left) and Scott Rigell, who co-sponsored the Social Security bill, riding their motorcycles at the Capitol in May 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578908c61300002c0005e1df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In an unusual move, a small group of House Republicans has endorsed higher taxes as part of a bipartisan strategy to improve the long-term financing of Social Security retirement insurance. “It’s the only bipartisan bill on Social Security reform that’s in the Congress right now,” said bill author Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.), speaking on the HuffPost Politics podcast “So That Happened.” Listen to our interview with Ribble at the 38-minute mark:Joined by four other Republicans and one Democrat, Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Ribble unveiled the legislation at a press conference outside the Capitol this week ― just before Congress adjourned for the rest of the summer. It’s highly uncommon for Republicans to endorse any kind of tax increase, even if it’s paired with benefit cuts. It’s probably not a coincidence that Ribble and all of his GOP co-sponsors are leaving Congress at the end of this term.Ribble told HuffPost that he thought some sort of reform would happen before he left. But he’s not on the House committee that oversees Social Security. “I kept expecting somebody to do it,” he said. “I was expecting the committees to do it, but they didn’t.”Social Security retirement insurance, which provides monthly benefits for 44 million older Americans, has enough money in its trust fund to cover those benefits until 2034. Through a combination of tax increases and benefit cuts ― mostly the latter ― Ribble’s legislation would make the program solvent for the next 75 years.Social Security is funded by a payroll tax, but only the first $118,000 in wages is subject to the tax. Even though that limit is adjusted for inflation each year, thanks to income inequality the tax captures a lower percentage of overall earnings than it used to. Ribble’s bill would achieve about a third of its revenue by gradually lifting the cap to $308,750, at which point he said the tax would capture the same percentage of wages as it did when Ronald Reagan was president.Nancy Altman is co-director of Social Security Works, a group that opposes any cuts to the program. She said she opposes Ribble’s bill, which would reduce benefits for some, in part by increasing the retirement age. But she welcomed the fact that even a few Republicans came out for raising the cap on the payroll tax. “What he is proposing is something that should have been done decades ago,” Altman said. “So That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week: Wisconsin Rep. Reid Ribble; Tim Black, host of “The Tim Black At Night Show”; and Huffington Post reporters Dana Liebelson, Ryan Reilly and Lauren Weber.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

Jesse Jackson.",2016-07-15,Mourners pay their respects to Alton Sterling at his funeral Friday in Baton Rouge.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578930ce1300002d0005e2d3.jpeg?cache=fHG8QPON3l&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alton Sterling’s life and legacy were recognized Friday by hundreds who packed a Baton Rouge auditorium for a special memorial service.Sterling, 37, died on July 5 after cops fired multiple bullets into his chest and back near a convenience store where he frequently sold CDs. His death sparked several protests in Baton Rouge and across the country, as people declared an end to police terror against black lives. Yet while the days after Sterling’s death were filled with anger and outrage, on Friday pastors and speakers, including Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson, among others, encouraged a spirit of praise and peace as they paid tribute to Sterling. The service was filled with powerful speeches, songs and poems, many of which included important messages on the need to end police killings of black men and women in America.“We’re not trying to convince you we matter. We know we matter,” Sharpton said in a stirring speech. “We have an inferior judicial system that does not protect all of it’s citizens equally.”“We’re not anti-police, we’re anti-wrong,” he added. “This man should not be here at his own funeral.” Rev. Jesse Jackson delivered a similar message and demanded that justice is the only satisfactory solution. “There is no substitute for justice,” Jackson said. “Not a check, not legal settlement, not a proclamation, not a street sign. Only justice will do.” Everyone who attended the service had been invited by the family, said one pastor at the beginning of the service. HuffPost reporter David Lohr was there on behalf of Black Voices, and streamed the service live on Facebook:Sterling, who is the 558th person to be shot and killed by a police officer this year, was the father of five children. Abdullah Muflahi, the owner of Triple S store where Sterling was shot, told the crowd: “Alton wasn’t just a CD man in front of my store. He was also a good friend of mine.”Muflahi added that Sterling told him to call him “Big Boy” and how he always made him smile.“He showed me a lot of love. He was friendly, welcoming, he was truly the meaning of Southern hospitality,” he said. “He was a big-hearted, sweet kind, selfless person. He made himself a place in everyone’s heart.”Many others shared positive reflections on Sterling. “He liked to laugh and make others laugh. He was always the life of the party,” said Sister Sateria Tate-Alexander. “He was loved by everyone.” Cameron Sterling, Alton’s 15-year-old son, didn’t speak, but shared at a press conference earlier this week that his father “was a good man and he will always be a good man” and urged protesters to remain peaceful and respectful of his father’s legacy. Other speakers talked about police brutality and the need for reform across America. “We have unjust laws, policies and procedures that are allowing unarmed black men to be killed by white police officers,” said Elder Tabatha Jackson. “Pain and anger has the ability to destroy you all,” she added, before making a more direct address to Cameron, Alton’s 15-year-old son. “Cameron, don’t let it.” Jackson also highlighted the important need to vote and encouraged attendees to do so to make sure their voices are truly heard: “Voting is critical to upholding our elected officials accountable, if you don’t register to vote, don’t protest.” This message was reinforced in a statement read aloud on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, and by U.S. Congressman Cedric Richmond, who, during his speech said: “We need our elected officials to wake up, show up, and stand up and speak up. We have to stand up and change the mentality of shoot first and ask questions later.” Members of Sterling’s family highlighted their family’s strength and resilience in light of so much pain and mourning.“The Sterling’s are strong people.

His death sparked several protests in Baton Rouge and across the country, as people declared an end to police terror against black lives. Yet while the days after Sterling’s death were filled with anger and outrage, on Friday pastors and speakers, including Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson, among others, encouraged a spirit of praise and peace as they paid tribute to Sterling. The service was filled with powerful speeches, songs and poems, many of which included important messages on the need to end police killings of black men and women in America.“We’re not trying to convince you we matter. We know we matter,” Sharpton said in a stirring speech. “We have an inferior judicial system that does not protect all of it’s citizens equally.”“We’re not anti-police, we’re anti-wrong,” he added. “This man should not be here at his own funeral.” Rev. Jesse Jackson delivered a similar message and demanded that justice is the only satisfactory solution. “There is no substitute for justice,” Jackson said. “Not a check, not legal settlement, not a proclamation, not a street sign. Only justice will do.” Everyone who attended the service had been invited by the family, said one pastor at the beginning of the service. HuffPost reporter David Lohr was there on behalf of Black Voices, and streamed the service live on Facebook:Sterling, who is the 558th person to be shot and killed by a police officer this year, was the father of five children. Abdullah Muflahi, the owner of Triple S store where Sterling was shot, told the crowd: “Alton wasn’t just a CD man in front of my store. He was also a good friend of mine.”Muflahi added that Sterling told him to call him “Big Boy” and how he always made him smile.“He showed me a lot of love. He was friendly, welcoming, he was truly the meaning of Southern hospitality,” he said. “He was a big-hearted, sweet kind, selfless person. He made himself a place in everyone’s heart.”Many others shared positive reflections on Sterling. “He liked to laugh and make others laugh. He was always the life of the party,” said Sister Sateria Tate-Alexander. “He was loved by everyone.” Cameron Sterling, Alton’s 15-year-old son, didn’t speak, but shared at a press conference earlier this week that his father “was a good man and he will always be a good man” and urged protesters to remain peaceful and respectful of his father’s legacy. Other speakers talked about police brutality and the need for reform across America. “We have unjust laws, policies and procedures that are allowing unarmed black men to be killed by white police officers,” said Elder Tabatha Jackson. “Pain and anger has the ability to destroy you all,” she added, before making a more direct address to Cameron, Alton’s 15-year-old son. “Cameron, don’t let it.” Jackson also highlighted the important need to vote and encouraged attendees to do so to make sure their voices are truly heard: “Voting is critical to upholding our elected officials accountable, if you don’t register to vote, don’t protest.” This message was reinforced in a statement read aloud on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, and by U.S. Congressman Cedric Richmond, who, during his speech said: “We need our elected officials to wake up, show up, and stand up and speak up.

24,ENTERTAINMENT,How Jonah Ryan And 'Big Head' Explain America,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/big-head-jonah-ryan-donald-trump_us_5789137fe4b0867123e106fd,"“Veep,” ""Silicon Valley,"" Donald Trump and the all-American act of failing up.",2016-07-15,"Jonah Ryan and Nelson ""Big Head"" Bighetti -- not America's two biggest idiots, but close.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578915752400002600b315ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Thursday, two things happened. In the morning, The New York Times revealed that Donald Trump was dead even with Hillary Clinton in terms of national support — at 40 percent each, according to a New YorkTimes/CBS News survey. Then, a few hours later, the Emmys revealed that both HBO’s “Veep” and “Silicon Valley” had been nominated once more for Outstanding Comedy Series.The events had nothing to do with each other. But all three acts ― the Donald Trump campaign, the Julia Louis-Dreyfus-led TV series about Washington D.C. incompetence and Mike Judge’s show about tech startups ― do share one thing in common: basking in the all-American tradition of white men failing upward.Regardless of how much you believe the start of Trump’s success should be attributed to that of his father, the real estate wizard Fred Trump, what’s indisputable is that Trump has continued since then, in spite of his own repeated failures. There were the well-documented bankruptcies of his Atlantic City casinos, yes, but there were also the now-defunct Trump Airlines, Trump Magazine, Trump Mortgage, Trump Vodka and on and on and on. And yet, here we find him, a businessman with a trail of disaster behind him, promoting himself as the businessman who can turn America around. And doing so successfully.The disconnect between Trump’s business narrative and business history has frustrated his many critics on both sides of the aisle, who believe they should provide ample evidence of his inability to lead the nation. But maybe we ― and I include myself in that group ― shouldn’t be so surprised. After all, the U.S. has a long and storied history of people, and white men in particular, achieving great success in spite of themselves.Anyone who has worked at an office for a length of time knows the tangible feeling of disgust as a less qualified (and sometimes wholly incompetent) employee gets the raise you deserved, the promotion you wanted or the recognition you need. Everywhere, there is evidence should you seek it that the system is set up for certain people at the expense of others. Men have an easier time receiving funding for their company or getting promoted within it. CEOs get $40 million golden parachutes to go away. George W. Bush, of all people, becomes president.Maybe that’s what makes two particular storylines in “Veep” and “Silicon Valley” so painful: the unstoppable rises of Jonah Ryan and Nelson “Big Head” Bighetti.Jonah Ryan, played by Timothy Simons, is a giant, gangly idiot of a man who works for, and sometimes seemingly against, President Selina Meyer. In Season 5, however, he finds himself thrust into a congressional race by sheer force of luck ― his uncle, a politically powerful man in New Hampshire, needing “some spectacular dumbass” to run against a widow until the real candidate ― Jonah’s cousin ― comes back from his military tour. But Jonah, as confident as he is foolish, gains momentum through a willingness to say whatever needs to be said (sound familiar?), and then, against all odds, he wins. Congressman Jonah Ryan, the newest spectacular dumbass in Congress.In “Silicon Valley,” on the other hand, there is Big Head, played by Josh Brener. Unlike Jonah, he is short. Like him, he is an idiot of a man with impeccable luck. While Ryan obtains power in spite of himself, Big Head obtains money. Despite no clear talent of any sort, the former Pied Piper employee ends up earning $600,000 to do nothing but sit on the roof at Hooli, a Google-like corporate behemoth, simply because the company’s CEO, Gavin Belson, wanted to stick it to Pied Piper. In essence, as someone puts it, Big Head becomes Hooli’s “VP of Spite.” In Season 3, the company even hands the local idiot a $20 million severance package if he will agree to a non-disclosure agreement.“You will not discuss anything you did at Hooli at all, in perpetuity, throughout the universe,” a Hooli employee tells him.“I didn’t really do anything at Hooli, so ... ” he replies.“Good! You’re getting the hang of it already.”(Big Head, naturally, is later offered a job as CEO of Pied Piper.)Perhaps the success of Big Head and Jonah Ryan should frustrate viewers. America, after all, was built on the idea that hard work leads to opportunity, not that bumbling idiocy leads to success. But certainly no one should ever be shocked by the storylines. After all, we have spent our entire lives watching men fail upward in real life. And soon, one could fail his way into the White House, too. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

This is their story. And soon, you can watch actors recreate the crime on TV. NBC has ordered a true crime spinoff of the long-running drama “Law and Order,” to be called “Law & Order: True Crime - The Menendez Brothers.” The first season of the anthology series will reportedly focus on the brothers’ notorious trial, according to Entertainment Weekly, with eight hourlong episodes to be executive-produced by Dick Wolf and written by “Law & Order” veteran René Balcer.“Rene and I have been working together over the past three decades and he is one of a handful of truly great showrunners with whom I’ve worked,” Wolf said in a statement. “‘Law & Order’ won the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series under his watch.”Following a highly publicized trial in the early ‘90s, Lyle and Erick Menendez were convicted of murdering their parents and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The brothers, who were 18 and 21 when the murders occurred, claimed they had been sexually and verbally abused by their parents. The 1994 television film “Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills” previously tackled the controversial killings, but considering the popularity of series like “Making a Murderer” and “The People vs. O.J. Simpson,” this seems like an open-and-shut case. "
26,CRIME,'Coffee With A Cop' Helps Officers And Civilians Find Common Ground,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coffee-with-a-cop_us_5787d00be4b03fc3ee4fd691,"The events are a small, positive step in many cities where trust is broken.",2016-07-15,"Dorothy Smith, right, talks with Miami-Dade county police officer Delma Noel-Pratt, left, during a Coffee with a Cop event at a local McDonald's on April 27, 2016, in Miami Gardens, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5788178e1b00002600f6e002.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Attempts to cool the tensions between police and the communities they serve have led some people to look for solutions in a hot cup of coffee. After the recent killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling by police and the fatal shooting of five Dallas cops by a sniper, the gap between officers and communities of color can seem unbridgeable. But a sergeant in a small police department near Los Angeles says he’s found tremendous success with a simple formula: having cops talk with members of the public over coffee in neutral settings. “Coffee is the mechanism. It’s the conversation that starts as a result of the coffee,” said Chris Cognac of the Hawthorne Police Department. “There’s nothing more important than this. People need to sit down, take a breath and listen to each other. We all want the same thing.”Cognac co-founded “Coffee with a Cop” in 2011, and the program has been picked up by hundreds of police and sheriff’s departments around the country. There’s typically a spike in interest in the program after disputed killings, he said, including the recent deaths in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and Dallas. The events aren’t formal, and don’t take much work to set up. Police schedule a Coffee with a Cop in a neutral place like a McDonald’s or Dunkin’ Donuts. People get a free cup of coffee and the chance to talk with officers and detectives.Opportunities to connect with law enforcement in a relaxed setting don’t happen very often, and many people only interact with cops during a confrontation or to report a crime. Peter Moskos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former Baltimore officer, said that Coffee with a Cop reminds police that they need more regular contact with civilians. “It’s such a basic fundamental element of policing, but many cities don’t do that,” said Moskos. “You shouldn’t need a program to discuss things over a coffee, but this shows that police departments are willing to make some steps.”Cops participating in the coffee klatches are often rank-and-file officers who work in the neighborhood where the event is being held. Some people want to talk about deep issues like Black Lives Matter, but often times attendees simply want help with neighborhood problems, like a series of car break-ins.“It’s not a briefing. It’s an intimate setting. There’s no speeches,” said Cognac.Simply put, the goal is to make police and civilians more comfortable with one another. That trust can pay dividends when a shooting or other crisis tests the strength of law enforcement’s relationship with the public.The events were part of a package of reforms in a city in eastern Washington state, after the Department of Justice investigated police there last year for fatally shooting a homeless man who’d been throwing rocks.The killing of Antonio Zambrano-Montes in Pasco, Washington, was likened to a “Ferguson moment” for Latinos. Pasco Police Capt. Ken Roske was skeptical that Coffee with a Cop would make a difference, but recognized that the department needed a new approach to community policing in the predominantly Latino city. “People are calling us names, but we knew we had a community that we had to continue to provide services to,” said Roske. “We could either put the brick wall up and say ‘we’ve done all we could do,’ or we could be open to see what else could we do”Tensions are lower now, Roske said, and Coffee with a Cop has been an important part of the police force’s effort to better engage with the public.Even one critic who’s upset that no charges were filed against the Pasco officers in the Zambrano-Montes case said the department has improved its standing with the community.“The value really comes because it’s like old-school police. Police who used to walk the beat, would know the people in their communities,” said Rick Rios of Consejo Latino, a group calling for police reform. “They had a public relations problem, so they had to make some kind of an effort.”But don’t think of Coffee with a Cop as a program for small towns with little crime, Cognac said. Police departments in big cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Boston and Montreal participate. Officers can enroll in a six-hour training before their first meeting, or download information from the Coffee with a Cop website.Casual conversations can’t fix every issue, and Cognac admits they won’t bring down crime statistics. But they can start to change the relationship between officers and locals.“You can’t measure the impact,” said Cognac. “The only way you can measure the impact is when there’s a critical incident and people come forward to defend you. This is the only program that heals.”"
