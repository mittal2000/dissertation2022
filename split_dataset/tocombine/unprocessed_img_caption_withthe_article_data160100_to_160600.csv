0,WELLNESS,How to Stop 'Shoulding' Yourself to Death: Breaking Free From the 'Should' Police,"Nancy Colier, Contributor

We have been taught, mistakenly, that if we don't ""should"" ourselves into action, we will become like those giant sloths that hang on trees -- inert. If not controlled, we would be unkind, ungrateful, un-generous, unproductive and every other ""un"" you can think of.",2013-03-21,Person under crumpled pile of papers with hand holding a help sign,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf10e26000032007fad01.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Are you ""shoulding"" yourself to death? All day, every day, are you telling yourself what you ""should"" do? Have you forgotten what you even ""want""? If you are like most people, the answer is ""yes."" The ""Should"" List Best-Sellers:You should be grateful to be alive. You should forgive. You should be compassionate. You should meditate. You should give back. You should be able to do nothing. You should be productive. You should de-clutter. You should take more trips. You should appreciate what you have. You should spend more time with your kids. You should want to spend more time with your kids. You should have more fun. You should spend less time on technology. You should have more sex. You should want to have more sex. You should laugh more. You should lose weight. You should exercise more. You should drink less. You should be happier.Whatever the specific ""shoulds"" on your list, they always add up to the same ""should"": You should be better!  The ""should"" police are here to tell you that, as you are, you are not good enough. What are we afraid will happen if we stop ""shoulding"" all over ourselves? We have been taught, mistakenly, that if we don't ""should"" ourselves into action, we will become like those giant sloths that hang on trees -- inert. And worse, if we don't ""should"" ourselves into being good, we won't be good! If not controlled, we would be unkind, ungrateful, un-generous, unproductive and every other ""un"" you can think of. Quite a vision of our basic nature! ""Shoulding"" all over ourselves actually strengthens our belief that -- left to our own devices -- we cannot be trusted.Because so much of our behavior is driven by ""should,"" we are losing our ability to distinguish what we really ""want."" We have been taught what we ""should"" want, but no longer know what we actually want, and often confuse the two. Out of touch with our own ""wanting,"" we have lost a sense of intimacy with ourselves. We know who we are supposed to be, but not who we are.To correct the ""Should""/""Want"" imbalance and bring us back into alignment with our true selves, I suggest the following practices:1. Ask yourself throughout the day ""Am I doing this because I want to or because I should?"" If it's because you ""should,"" then ""Why do I believe I should?"" ""What do I fear will happen if I don't do it?"" Finally, notice if recognizing your choice as a ""should"" changes the choice itself, or the way it feels to carry out. Even if your actions remain unchanged, simply identifying your choice as a ""should"" or ""want"" is meaningful, and will help you know your true motivations and intentions and thus -- know yourself. 2. Set aside a period of time (at least an hour every day) as a ""should-free"" zone -- a time when you only attend to that which you ""want."" If anything shows up as a ""should,"" set it aside for later or let it go altogether. If no ""want"" shows up, that's fine as it may take some time for a ""want"" to actually form inside you. Remember, ""want"" itself has become atrophied, like an under-used muscle. As well, sometimes the ""want"" is just to do nothing, so listen for that ""want"" as well. Through these practices we often discover that we are not what we assumed (and were taught to believe). When we stop telling ourselves that we ""should"" be good, it turns out that much to our surprise, we are good. Our natural instinct is in fact to be compassionate and kind; being good simply feels good. When we stop forcing ourselves to be good (in order to check it off our ""should-do"" list), and instead, allow our inherent goodness to lead us into action, we feel nourished and full, simultaneously receiving the goodness that we offer. Goodness that emanates from ""want"" feels radically different (and better) than goodness that comes from ""should."" We may also discover that we want some things that we could never have imagined wanting. One woman assured me that she would absolutely positively never ""want"" to exercise, and never do it if she didn't ""should"" herself into it. I gave her a challenge -- to stop exercising until she genuinely wanted to. If the wanting didn't appear, she would simply return to exercising because she ""should."" Low and behold, 23 days later, a real desire to move showed up! It turned out that her body wanted to walk in the park -- not on a treadmill as she had been doing for 25 years. And surprisingly, there was also a craving for swimming, something she had never considered. ""Who is this person that actually wants to move, and swim of all things!"" she exclaimed. It was an enlightening discovery -- to realize that she was not someone who wanted to lie on the couch and eat bonbons all day. The act of suspending ""should,"" and giving ""want"" a chance to emerge allowed her to meet her true self. Sometimes ""want"" never comes. There are things we do in life strictly because we ""should,"" and some are very important. I am not suggesting that we stop being responsible adults. However, when we do something because we ""should,"" and we mindfully acknowledge that ""should,"" then, we can offer ourselves compassion in the doing. We can take good care of ourselves, and honor the wisdom and strength of our discernment -- to choose to do something even when we simultaneously do not want to do it. The choice is made mindfully, which, in and of itself, feels both loving and empowering. Even hard choices, when made in the light of awareness, are nourishing and satisfying, which is not the case when we are blindly obeying yet another ""should."" Becoming aware of our relationship with ""should"" and ""want"" allows us to meet who we really are. Simultaneously, it gives us freedom. When we are aware of the forces that are driving our actions, we can decide how we ""want"" to live and break free from the tyranny of ""should."" We have been trained to believe in ""should"" and fear ""want,"" but this conditioning, with a little practice, can also be undone and re-trained. Start offering your ""should"" police a day off here and there and get ready to meet someone you may never have known.For more by Nancy Colier, click here.For more on success and motivation, click here."

3,WELLNESS,"'Healthy' Fast Food Dishes Like Egg White McMuffins, Turkey Burgers Could Boost Companies' Profits",Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healthy-fast-food_us_5b9cf342e4b03a1dcc8339d8,The impact of offering healthy dishes on fast food companies' bottom line is also magnified by the fact that few people eat,2013-03-20,"This product image released by Burger King shows the fast food restaurant's new Turkey Burger. Burger King says it's introducing a turkey burger for the first time. The burger will be part of its limited-time offers for the spring. McDonald's and Wendy's say they've never offered a turkey burger, although regional chains Carl's Jr. and Hardee's rolled them out in 2010. (AP Photo/Burger King)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf3422100003000c5539a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This month, three major restaurant chains beefed up their offerings of ""healthy"" fast food -- perhaps good news for dieters who occasionally find themselves eating meals at major fast food chains. But the executives of these companies aren't trying to make their customers thinner. They're trying to make their profit margins bigger.McDonald's announced it would sell a yolkless version of its Egg McMuffin breakfast sandwiches, Burger King unveiled a turkey burger that's been called ""a gamechanger"" in the industry, and Cracker Barrel -- which says it is ""unable to provide exact calorie or fat information"" for hearty dishes like fried chicken and mac n' cheese -- quietly started testing a new ""Wholesome Fixins"" menu of dishes with fewer than 600 calories. Perhaps counterintuitively, fast food executives don't expect these new dishes to sell particularly well -- healthy options at unhealthy restaurants almost never do. Darren Tristiano of market research firm Technomic noted that only a quarter of all Americans say they ever order off a ""healthy menu."" He added that, in most markets, only 1 to 2 percent of all burger orders are veggie, and fried chicken dishes generally outsell comparable grilled chicken dishes nine to one. ""The consumer is always going to gravitate towards flavor -- and that's never going to be healthier,"" Tristiano said.Instead, these chains are adding egg whites and ground turkey to their menus to make consumers think of their restaurants as healthy -- or at least not gratuitously unhealthy -- and, by extension, OK to visit. In other words, healthy menu items are marketing tools. Like any other new product introduction, they bring attention to the chain; unlike, say, Cool Ranch Doritos Tacos, they shift perception of the brand toward virtue. And rightly so: Burger King's turkey burger weighs in at 530 calories, 15 percent fewer than a classic Whopper.But once customers are in the door, they often order unhealthy food no matter what. Even those drawn by the promise of a diet-friendly meal often end up ordering the burger and fries.""People might not actually have any interest in actually getting this item, but they'll sort of appreciate it being there,"" explained trend forecaster Marian Berelowitz of JWT. ""Or maybe they're thinking, 'Well, next time I'll get that.' But then they never actually do.""Nima Samadi, an industry analyst at IBISWorld, traced fast food's eagerness to introduce healthy items back to the experience of McDonald's in early 2000s, after the release of the film ""Super Size Me."" Director Morgan Spurlock's hit documentary generated enough bad press to pose a serious threat to the chain -- prompting McDonald's to abolish the ""supersize"" option and add a range of new salads and, later, smoothies to its menu.""Their reputation was down in the dumps. They were dealing with a lot of perception issues,"" Samadi explained. ""But by systematically rolling out healthy items, they've been able to change that a lot.""The new menu items made consumers feel better about McDonald's -- but they continued, by and large, to order the same old Big Macs. Other chains that have since introduced healthy options have had similar experiences.To be sure, some people do order the healthy options. They're not total loss leaders. According to the NPD Group's Bonnie Rigg, about 8 percent of all restaurant meals are motivated by health. That's not a huge share, but if fast food chains were to cede it entirely and offer no healthy options, they would certainly lose some business. Rigg said the interest in healthy meals is higher (about 11 percent) among those over 65, a growing share of the American population. Partially for that reason, she expects sales of healthy-menu items to ""grow strongly"" through 2022. The impact of offering healthy dishes on fast food companies' bottom line is also magnified by the fact that few people eat alone. If just one member of a dinner group was dieting, the lack of a low-calorie option at a given restaurant could be a dealbreaker for the others as well. Cornell University professor Brian Wansink, author of the forthcoming book Slim By Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, added that a so-called ""veto vote"" based on dietary concerns is disproportionately likely to come from the ""nutritional gatekeeper"" of a family, often a mother. ""For that reason,"" he said, ""The wrong thing to do is think of the calculus when it comes to these new healthy dishes as being how many of them are sold. What you have to consider is how many additional things get sold that [restaurants] wouldn't have sold if those healthy items weren't on the menu.""That calculus works in practice as well as theory, if a study on the sales of healthy dishes at chain restaurants released last month by the Hudson Institute is to be believed. But it's less clear how it affects Americans' health. New low-calorie options might make the average meal at a fast food restaurant less unhealthy. But that's a Pyrrhic victory against obesity if the broader menu variety gets more Americans eat fast food for dinner.Clarification: Language has been added to the article to indicate that McDonald's menu included some salad choices prior to 2004."

(AP Photo/Random House)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf397240000500094e2ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I read Michael Moss's new book, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, I saw myself in it. I grew up as an average American kid in the 1990s, eating and enjoying all of the food items highlighted in Moss' book. Sugary cereal before school. Lunchables pizza with my classmates in the cafeteria. ""Healthy"" low-fat cookies for dessert. Like many other parents, mine were poorly educated on the health implications of daily consumption of these products. They just knew that my sister and I loved this food and would eat it without apprehension. In some cases, like the low-fat cookies, my parents believed that they were providing a healthy alternative to other snacks.As I grew older, the effects of my diet became more apparent. I was an active child. I played outside with my friends, and on organized sports teams including baseball, basketball, soccer and football. Even with my constant athletic involvement, I still was overweight throughout all of my adolescent years. I was teased because of it. My weight issues peaked my sophomore year of high school when I weighed 250 pounds, stopped playing sports, had no self-esteem, and was winded after running a half mile.Reading Moss' book, I grew uneasy as he described the marketing and engineering principles used to reach one of the most targeted demographics: children. Examples include the use of fruit juice concentrate, which can make up as little as five percent of the total beverage, to give the ""health halo"" to sugary drinks. Other packaging mistruths include the promotion of cereals that are more than 50 percent sugar as part of a well-rounded breakfast. Lunchables are packaged to imitate the cheerful appearance of a gift to make children especially excited to open and enjoy the food inside.Since the 1970s, researchers have known that kids are attracted to higher levels of salt and sugar, which companies have used as an advantage for their products. Moss quotes Julie Mennella, a biopsychologist, who describes this as ""manipulating or exploiting the biology of the child."" I was one of the kids these companies targeted and successfully sold their products to, becoming one of their ""heavy users.""Moss declares that, ""[the companies] may have salt, sugar, and fat on their side, but we, ultimately, have the power to make choices. After all, we decide what to buy. We decide how much to eat."" I fully agree with his sentiment. After my sophomore year in high school, I made the choice to stop eating these highly processed foods and began my own exercise program. Now I have completed six half-marathons and one full marathon and maintained my 65 pound weight loss. I earned a degree in nutrition and am currently working toward becoming a registered dietitian. However, from my own experience, personal responsibility is difficult to maintain when other manipulative forces are at work.I don't blame companies for providing a product that is unhealthy. Businesses need to make investors happy and produce growth by selling more. I do take offense to trickery and the obfuscation of nutritional messages that manipulate children and parents into purchasing unhealthy products as ""normal"" every day food. It makes losing weight and maintaining it really hard. This food environment that is promoted as ""normal"" today is one in which the deepest discounts at the grocery store are almost always offered on unhealthy junk food, and the food companies with the least healthy products often have the brightest and most appealing shelf-placement and packaging. Do we really want to make unhealthy food the easy option, the norm, the default?As a FoodCorps service member teaching kids about healthy food, I see these issues firsthand. First graders know exactly what potato chips or pizza are but cannot identify cauliflower. We receive requests from high school consumer science teachers to lead nutrition classes, because their students eat a bag of Cheetos and a soda for breakfast. Even though at FoodCorps we have successes and are making small changes, it is difficult to change students' perception of foods in this toxic food environment. Many of them would call normal food the stuff that ends in ""nugget"" or ""mac,"" instead of spinach or sweet potatoes. I believe a good first step is to protect and support our children with education and environments conducive to healthy behaviors. It is not acceptable to quit in the face of initial opposition from children to new and different foods. Like FoodCorps co-founder, Debra Eschmeyer says ""We don't give up on our kids with math, and we shouldn't give up on them with healthy food.""In addition to education, we must fight for change. We must stop giving the upper hand to companies that sell food on the premise of ""betcha can't eat just one."" We need to work together to create a ""normal"" food environment in which it is not a struggle to be healthy. We must strive for this change, one meal at a time."

Civil libertarians say it is a threat to free speech in an age when the internet gives everyone the power to be heard around the world. (AP Photo/Sang Tan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf1932000003100fdc5e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As your children develop and enter the social world outside of your home, their peers' importance to them will grow. In fact, as your children progress through high school, their peer group will exert a sometimes dismayingly great influence over them as you feel your own relationship with them diminish. Basically, being accepted and liked by their peers and having friends becomes a central part of their self-identity. That pursuit of friendship has been dramatically altered by new technology. At one level, social networking has been a boon to offline friendships. Friends can stay in regular contact, share ideas, feelings, and experiences in real time without the barriers of distance or time that used to limit them. Cyberspace has become to the only place to hang out for a generation of children whose parents are too afraid to allow them to ""roam free range."" Additionally, social media affords children the opportunity to practice communication skills, gain confidence in social interactions, and build friendships with the greater comfort that comes with mediated relationships. Social networking also allows children to express themselves in different ways and gauge the reactions of others. There is some evidence that the more time young people spend on social media, the more ""virtual empathy"" they're able to express, meaning they're able to express concern for others through text messages and social media posts. So, in some ways, online technology has extended the meaning and range of friendships in a positive direction.Yet, the immersion in technology that is simply life as they know it for digital natives is having an even greater impact on how children view friendships than the benefits I just described. This influence may make the costs outweigh the advantages (you have to be the judge). When you look at how technology has changed the definition and meaning of friendships to children, you'll notice several things that place online friendships in a different sphere than face-to-face friendships. Whereas, in the physical world, the word friend is a noun and a condition (""a friend""), in cyberspace it's a verb and an action (""to friend""). The development of conventional friendships is an incremental process that involves deepening stages of shared communication, trust, and openness. Online, friends are made in the click of a mouse, unilaterally, and with little or no communication between the ""friends."" Old-school friendships are private, online friendships are decidedly public. There is one quality in particular that signifies what is perhaps most stark distinction between traditional and online friendships, namely, the former is about the quality of relationships and the latter is often about the quantity of relationships. In real life, the goal is to have a few really good friends. With social media, the goal -- which is obviously in the best interests of the social networking sites -- is to accumulate as many so-called friends as possible. The message that children who spend a great deal of time in these forms of social media is that quantity trumps quality. So children may come to value friendships in terms of numbers rather than depth. Technology has also created another term in the lexicon of friendships, namely, ""defriending."" Losing a friend in real life is often, but not always, difficult. Sometimes, friendships fade away with time and absence of contact and the impact on children tends to be minimal. Other times, there is a conflict that precipitates the end of a friendship. In this case, though there may be ill feelings, the break-up is private, there are clear reasons for it, and both children had an understanding and perhaps some control over what happened. In contrast, so-called defriending that occurs through social media can be more painful than losing friends in the real world because it's usually abrupt (a click of a mouse), unexplained, and may be public. Defriending through social media can also be crueler because of the distance and disconnect that technology provides during a conflict. Children tend to be nicer when face to face because they see the impact of their rejection on their friend and, thankfully, most children don't like to hurt others. Do you remember the saying from the 1979 film, Alien? ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" Well, in today's connected world, that could be modified to ""In cyberspace, no one can hear you scream.""With this constant exposure to these messages from technology about what friendships are, a concern is whether those messages will begin to shape how children approach, create, and maintain relationships off line. A follow-up concern is, if this is the case, what are the ramifications of these altered perceptions and experiences of friendships on children's future friendships and the role of friendships in our increasingly technologically mediated culture. Unfortunately, if these concerns are legitimate, by the time we find out, it will be too late."

Author, ""The Fourth Trimester: Understanding, Protecting and N...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newborn-infant-crying-fourth-trimester_us_5b9cf23ae4b03a1dcc832e26,"What do we do after we've diapered, fed, swaddled, cuddled, rocked, sung, de-swaddled, re-diapered, bounced, swung and walked the floor? What do we do if we've emptied our entire bag of infant-calming tricks and nothing works?",2013-03-20,Their Baby Cuteness Doesn't Predict Adult Attractiveness ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b03bb26000036007ef76b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"When a newborn infant screws up her face and lets loose with a full-throated wail, it's one of the most nerve-jangling sounds we can hear. Even worse is the eerie silence that can come between screams. When the howls go on and on, we instinctively want to do something to help. We want to make the crying stop. But, what do we do after we've diapered, fed, swaddled, cuddled, rocked, sung, de-swaddled, re-diapered, bounced, swung and walked the floor? What do we do if we've emptied our entire bag of infant-calming tricks and nothing works? Here's what we do. We hang in there. We do our best to stay calm. We keep trying. Certainly, there are times when a pediatrician should be called for advice or a check-up to make sure nothing is physically wrong. But infants cry -- a lot -- for good reason, or sometimes for no apparent reason. Science tells us that even when we can't figure out what's wrong, our soft words and comforting touch still teach the infant this optimistic life lesson: When you're in distress, mom or dad or someone who loves you is going to stick by you, even when they don't have a clue what's troubling you. The Fourth TrimesterWhen I say ""infant"" or ""newborn,"" I mean a baby who is roughly three months old or younger. Infants that young are simply not neurologically or emotionally prepared to have their cries ignored. Later, they'll begin to figure out all the wonderful ways in which tears and sobs can manipulate their parents. But not yet.Multiple branches of science, including evolutionary anthropology, neurology, biology and developmental psychology, tell us that the first three months of life is a crucial bridge from the comfortable world of the uterus to life in the world we all know. Think of it as the fourth trimester, a period of intense development in which infants have more in common with the fetuses they were than with the human babies they are becoming. That's because human infants are unique in the animal world. They come to us with only 25 percent of their brains developed, the least neurologically prepared primate on earth. The brains of human newborns come equipped with more than enough neurons, but they don't yet have the brain wiring that allows for communication among the cells. Those communication networks begin to develop from day one with each sound, taste, blurry sight and comforting touch that comes their way.  Infants are helpless for sure, but they're also amazingly competent. At birth, they have only one communication tool at their disposal: their cry. It signals hunger, discomfort, fear, or lonelines -- all needs that were effortlessly met in the womb. Their very survival during the fourth trimester depends on their cry.Something to Cry AboutThink for a minute about what the world must look, sound, feel and smell like to a newborn baby. Put yourself in a neonate's place and imagine emerging from a cozy, temperature-controlled and highly personalized sac and suddenly landing in this chaotic world of ours. Everything formerly known and craved -- food, warmth, security -- has been left behind. Lights, noise, pokes and prods are alien and harsh. Exhausted from the birth rides, infants take their first breath and exhale a vigorous cry of life. Repetition is Boring, Even when You're a Week OldIt's our job to ease them through this time of transition by responding to cries and trying to give them what they need. When the need isn't food, a diaper change, relief from being too hot or too cold or other obvious necessities, we're stymied. I don't believe that there is a magic formula for comforting every baby every time. One infant might calm down when swaddled while another hates the tight wrap. One might find comfort in quiet darkness while another quiets down to the sound of a lullaby.One father told me that he was sure he found the perfect routine to soothe his infant son. He ran water in the shower, while cuddling the baby as he bounced on an exercise ball in the bathroom. The combination of dim light, the sound of water, the bouncing motion and the security of being in his father's arms was just the ticket. It worked on day one. It worked again on days two and three. The parents were delighted, and the father felt like a child-care genius. Then came day four, and the shower bouncing routine no longer worked. The baby continued to be inconsolable as his father bounced away and the water ran down the drain. We've all had similar experiences. We find a certain way of holding brings peace and are sure that a football hold, for example, is the ticket; or a cradle hold; or an over the shoulder hold. We think the answer is to face the infant forward or backward or sideways or face down on our laps. It works once or twice, then stops working.The truth is, babies are like the rest of us. Something pleases them one minute, they lose interest the next. Babies get bored, too. Silence works one day, a lullaby the next. Rocking one day, laying them down while rubbing their backs the next. It's an ongoing experiment, and your efforts to understand represent the first days of what will become a lifelong communication based on observation and love. The best you can do is pay attention to their signals day by day. When an infant cries, he has a need. You know how to check a diaper or prepare a feeding. But loneliness is also a need for a brand-new human being who, for nine months, has never been alone. So hang in there. Let them know that you've got the parental chops to see them through distress. Let their most early experiences in life show them that, just as their biological mothers were right there with them through the three trimesters of pregnancy, someone who loves them is going to be right by their side through the crucial fourth trimester of development.EARLIER ON HUFFPOST PARENTS"

AFP PHOTO / Karen BLEIER (Photo credit should read KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf2022000004e00fdc607.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A study by Pew Internet in 2012 found that parents are online more than non-parents, concluding that they have greater concern about what their children are doing online and adopt new technology in order to monitor, and that a growing number of parents are social media users themselves. Most parents of this current generation are 'digital immigrants,' meaning they learned to use online media and technology as adults; however their children will be 'digital natives,' having grown up with this technology from a very young age. New technology and social media has done amazing things for the average person, providing the opportunity for anyone to voice their opinion, to connect to similar-minded people and to communicate with others across the digital space. Social media also has its negatives, such as the trend of people being dishonest when online and, conversely, of revealing private and intimate information when online. I've written before about being authentic in digital interactions (here), but an extension of this is the representation of children by their parents on social media and how parents reveal personal details about their family. There's a growing awareness of the potential negative impact from 'oversharenting': how a parent's sharing of private details about their children could be harmful to the child's healthy social and psychological development. It's easily understandable why parents want to share about their child -- children do funny, adorable and sometimes completely frustrating things, and sharing these anecdotes provides parents with the opportunity to gain a laugh or sympathy from others. It is also understandable that people write about the things that they are surrounded by for most of the day, just as people who are focused on their careers frequently write about work. Parents can experience more social isolation than non-parents and social media provides an opportunity to connect with others. Yet, a number of experts have advised parents to be cautious and considerate when posting about other people, especially children. Consider this social media profile: the mother's profile picture is an image of her child, there is very little mention of the father or other friends or family, and the majority of the status updates and images posted relate to activities or commentary about the child. Here's another example: a parent who after the birth of their child creates an email address and social media account, and then begins posting on behalf of that newborn child. You could be forgiven for wondering why an individual's online activity appears to be more about someone else than it is about their self. Obviously the purpose of the profile is important here -- a blog about motherhood which is located within a community of other parents is totally appropriate if that was the intention in creating that account. Most people these days understand the fundamental rule of online privacy, which is that you don't directly write about other people without their permission because there's a risk of negative consequences; at least they would be angry with you about what was written and at worst there could be legal issues due to libel or defamation. But isn't it strange that this rule of courtesy doesn't extend to children, who are unable to give informed consent to having their information shared publicly? Is it because of an assumption that children aren't likely to read or understand the information, and therefore won't be affected by it? This belief is unfortunately short-sighted because it fails to consider that online information could be permanently recorded and that one day the child will be interested and capable of looking at this information. Aside from the privacy issues, this type of behavior reveals an identity issue and loss of boundaries between parent and child. A profile picture is what we choose to show of ourselves to the outside world; there's already been considerable research and discussion about how profile photos are carefully chosen to show us at our best and how they also reveal information about our identity or our values. By choosing to show a profile image of their child the person reveals that they over-identify with their 'parent' role, and the focus on writing about the child shows they've prioritized the child as the most important aspect of them self, rather than discussing their self as a distinct individual with separate interests and hobbies. The ideal here would be a balance of the various roles that we all perform, such as 'mother' 'wife' 'employee' 'daughter' etc., and a balance of attention across the various life domains, such as work, health, leisure and social, as well as family. According to Jacques Lacan, a contemporary of Sigmund Freud, a crucial phase of child development is the 'mirror stage' which he believed occurred between the ages of six months to eighteen-months-old. It is during this stage that the formation of the ego occurs; this develops from awareness within the child of the differentiation between itself and the external world. Prior to this stage the child imagines that everything is an extension of itself. It is through the attention of the parents, commonly the mother, that the child gains an opportunity to see itself as a separate being by reflection from the other person. One of the fundamentals of psychoanalysis is the belief that problems in this stage of development will continue to occur in the social relationships of this individual throughout their lifespan. So, how does a child properly develop this sense of ""otherness"" when the parent has over-identified with their role, and the child is an extension of the parent's identity? The result is that the child will constantly look to others for reassurance or confirmation of who they are, their existence is dependent on their relationship to another person. Parents have a responsibility to do their best to assist their children with developing into healthy balanced individuals. Part of this responsibility is acknowledging the child's right to privacy and their right to be respected as an individual, balanced with also monitoring and supervising them. It is also important for children to grow up to make their own choices about who they are and how they want to represent themselves, without having their identities formed for them by pre-existing information on social media -- a reflection of stories, images and opinions of which they are not the author. Access to online activities should be introduced at age-appropriate developmental stages. Assisting a child to set up an account or profile is an opportunity to discuss with them responsible and respectful online activity and empowers the child to assume ownership of their digital identity.If any of this behavior sounds familiar for you, take a moment to consider how you can model appropriate online behaviour and support your child to make wiser choices online."

It must have been written in the stars, seeing as this beautiful Spanish beach city seems to have as many watering holes as there are balls of gas burning holes in the night sky. Wine bars, whiskey bars, cocktail bars, sports bars, beer halls, and pre-game-for-the-club bars all can be found with ease. Heck, there are even beach bars where you can swim off the last round. And we at Party Earth know such exhaustive options can be overwhelming, even driving people crazy enough to drink (did we just figure out Barcelona's secret to its nightlife?).Anyway, we'll stop theorizing and do our jobs, which is to clear through the clutter and show you some of our top spots to go. So whether you want loud and rowdy or trendy and upscale, below are some of our favorite bars in Barcelona, with enough combined variety to please all alcohol-inclined tastes. Chupitos Barri GòticHere's a quick Spanish lesson for today: ""Chupitos"" means shots. And in the case of this unruly Barri Gòtic bar, it means an absurd amount of them. The options are posted across the entire wall behind the long bar, and with more shots on display than LMFAO could shout in a single song, it'll take a lot more than one visit to try every one of these depravity-inducing concoctions. The bartenders at Chupitos Barri Gòtic are as much entertainers as they are drink pourers, lighting things on fire (don't worry, your hair is safe) and ordering patrons to partake in drinking activities that you'd never want the boss to see. With no descriptions or ingredients listed, picking your shot is like a drunk man's Russian roulette: maybe you'll get a delicious glass with blue flames dancing on the surface, or you could find yourself sucking down liquor out of a phallic-shaped squirt gun -- either way, you'll be too drunk to care.Dry Martini BarThose who prefer their drinks made with vermouth, dashed with bitters and pinched with unique crushed herbs only a botanist has heard of should head to Dry Martini Bar, an upscale mixology joint in the L'Eixample neighborhood. Plush leather seating and fine liquors lining the portrait-laden walls highlight the upscale atmosphere, all enjoyed by a regular clientele that is more mature than what's found at your average Barcelona drinking destination. An evening here means joining the well-dressed denizens slowly savoring the flavors of their expertly crafted drinks rather than throwing them back in one rambunctious gulp. So put on your best Sean Connery voice and tell the white-tuxedo-toting waiter that you'd like your martini ""shaken, not stirred."" Then sit back and let them do whatever they want -- they know more than you.Soho El RavalLess than 10 miles away across the Strait of Gibraltar, it's no surprise that Morocco's culture is so widespread in Spain. And for those looking for a signature North African experience in Barcelona, Soho El Raval may be the city's best, and certainly most authentic, Moroccan hookah bar. If you want to blow rings of fruity smoke with your friends while you pass the day, just step into the open entrance and take a seat against the Egyptian tapestries that line the ground floor or head up to the cozy second floor loft. It's a shabby little place; its warm and friendly atmosphere makes up for any lack of décor. With a variety of beer options and delicious shawarma also available, hookah lovers visiting Soho for the first time will be saying to themselves that this could be the start of a beautiful friendship.London BarThe historic London Bar has been open since 1910 and was once the favored watering hole of such hard-drinking notables as Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso. Character oozes from the art deco walls lined with antique adornments and even an old piano, keeping the bohemian vibe alive and well inside. Expats and travelers escape the hectic flow of nearby Las Ramblas with a cold beer during the day, and a backroom opens up later in the night to accommodate the growing crowds. Whether it's to drink within the walls of history or simply make a mellow stop before hitting the crazier bars in Barcelona, we think that if London Bar was good enough for one of the greatest drinkers (and writers) of the 20th century, then it's probably good enough for you.For more articles and reviews, go to Party Earth."
