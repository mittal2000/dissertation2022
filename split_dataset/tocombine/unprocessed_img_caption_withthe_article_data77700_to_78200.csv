0,POLITICS,Ben Carson Is Dead Wrong About A Muslim President And The Constitution,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-constitution-muslims_us_560032c2e4b0fde8b0cf0ee0,The Founders said no to a national faith and no to religious tests for public office.,2015-09-21,The Constitution does not endorse Ben Carson's views.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_12_281_2708_2270%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson took a dubious stand on American values on Sunday when he expressed his unwillingness to support a Muslim presidential candidate. Asked by NBC's Chuck Todd whether Islam is ""consistent with the Constitution,"" Carson said no. His campaign spokesman Doug Watts didn't help matters Sunday night when he told NBC News that ""there is a huge gulf between the faith and practice of the Muslim faith, and our Constitution and American values.""""That can be disputed,"" Watts said. ""That can be debated. But there's pretty strong evidence to that effect.""What really can't be disputed or debated is what the Constitution says -- and doesn't say -- about which faith or creed best represents its values. The Constitution does not permit a national religion, and the Framers took great care to draft the document in secular terms. On the one hand is the First Amendment, which clearly states that the government cannot make any law ""respecting an establishment of religion."" In the words of the Supreme Court, this generally means that the government can't ""set up a church,"" ""pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another,"" or otherwise become entangled in religious affairs.As University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone wrote in a Huffington Post blog last year, one reason the Framers created this ""wall of separation between church and state"" was that they viewed religion ""not as a unifying force, but as a potentially divisive factor that threatened to undermine their goal of forming a more perfect union.""The founders' concerns help explain why another section of the First Amendment -- the one protecting the right to freely exercise any religion -- also stands as a barrier against official attempts to give primacy to one religion over another.The Supreme Court put this right in its proper context in a 1985 decision (which references Islam by an older term):At one time it was thought that this right merely proscribed the preference of one Christian sect over another, but would not require equal respect for the conscience of the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Mohammedism or Judaism. But when the underlying principle has been examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all.The Constitution is also explicit about how ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.""More than 50 years ago, the Supreme Court was presented with an opportunity to interpret that section of the Constitution, in the case of a Maryland official who was appointed by the governor but denied his commission because he refused to profess a belief in God under the state constitution.The Supreme Court unanimously sided with the official, holding that Maryland's requirement violated the U.S. Constitution. Curiously, though, the court did not base its ruling on the ""no religious test"" clause, which comes in Article VI, but determined that the First Amendment was enough to decide the matter conclusively.""We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion,"" wrote Justice Hugo Black for the court. ""Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against nonbelievers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.""Professor Stone observed that since that 1961 decision, it has been ""accepted wisdom that governments in the United States cannot constitutionally deny individuals the right to hold public office because they do not believe in God.""By the same token, it should be accepted wisdom that Carson is the one on the wrong side of the Constitution when it comes to accepting a Muslim in the Oval Office. Nothing in our founding document stands in the way of a Muslim or any other believer or nonbeliever from serving in any public office."

Just months after the horrific church shooting that took place only nine miles from its arena, the team will be playing for the ""Charleston 12"" -- the 12 people who were at the prayer service at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church when the gunman opened fire -- as well as for the city’s community as a whole, as it begins to recover from the June 17 tragedy. Stingray team president Rob Concannon announced on Monday that his organization will host a “special Opening Night” on Oct. 17, to “honor and remember” those affected by the shooting.“It’s going to be a pretty special night,"" Zach Fisch, the team's director of communications and broadcasting, told The Huffington Post on Monday. ""We wanted to do it right and we wanted to remember everyone that was in that church.” The Stingrays will be wearing jerseys emblazoned with the “Charleston Strong” slogan that gained traction after the massacre -- a rallying cry of sorts for the South Carolina community at large. They also will be taking donations throughout the night, with the collected funds going to the victims’ families.The event will, of course, celebrate the lives of the nine people who were killed in the attack. But the Stingrays also want to shift some of the focus to the shooting's three survivors -- Polly Sheppard, Felicia Sanders and her granddaughter -- who have “kind of felt forgotten” in the hate crime’s aftermath, according to Fisch. “Everyone is coming to the aid of the church, which is very valid and needed, but we wanted to make sure that the three people that were impacted [by the shooting] were recognized, that the community has rallied for them and that the 'Charleston Strong' mantra that we really have rallied around in this community was out there,” Fisch said.Fisch explained that Concannon has already spoken to and received the support of the survivors, who will be in the arena for the game’s honorary puck drop. And while Fisch stressed that the team felt a connection with each of the members of the ""Charleston 12,"" one victim, Tywaza Sanders, had an even more direct link to the organization. Sanders, Concannon stated, had been a participant in the Stingrays’ “Learn to Play Hockey” roller camp two decades ago.It is these relationships -- with those who were both within and outside of the church walls that day -- that are the basis of and the inspiration behind the team’s opening night, and all that it entails.Also on HuffPost:"

Clinton could face more hurdles if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.Sanders already has introduced legislation in the Senate to crack down on what he called ""skyrocketing"" increases in prescription drug prices.On Monday, shares in biotech companies such as Immunogen and Gilead Sciences dropped after Clinton tweeted that steep prices for specialty drugs were ""outrageous.""""Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on,"" she said. She pointed to a New York Times story that said while prices sometimes rise due to drug shortages, other times prices balloon as a result of a company's business strategy of buying older drugs and turning them into expensive specialty drugs.The newspaper reported how the price of a drug to treat a deadly parasitic infection soared to $750 a tablet from $13.50 after it was bought in August by a pharmaceutical company.The Nasdaq biotech index skidded 4.6 percent on Monday while the S&P healthcare sector fell 1.35 percent."

Many of them, as it turns out, are located in the same state: California.In a story published last week in The New York Times’ The Upshot section, David Leonhardt points out that six of the top seven schools ranked in the paper’s second annual College Access Index are University of California campuses. The rankings are based on three key factors -- share of students receiving Pell grants, those students’ graduation rates and the annual cost of tuition, fees and housing combined for low- and middle-income students.While Leonhardt reports that, based on the index, economic diversity at the nation’s top colleges and university has stagnated, some campuses are making progress.The University of California schools are seeing success, he argues, because of their “aggressive” push to keep tuition affordable for low-income, first-generation students and to prioritize the community-college transfer pipeline. This achievement is at risk, however, because state funding stagnation -- and threats of further cuts -- have made for a lower number of in-state students being enrolled at the state’s public universities when compared with wealthier out-of-state and international students, who pay higher tuition. The feature includes video interviews with students who participate in LEDA, a national program that helps low-income students succeed in college, and who spoke to the challenges they’ve encountered while pursuing their education.In a companion piece to the new index, Leonhardt reports on the increased popularity of an easier-to-understand financial-aid calculator developed by Wellesley College two years ago. Previous coverage from the Times on this issue has included the efforts of Washington University to recruit more economically-diverse students and the creation of a new annual prize awarded to top colleges that excel at enrolling and graduating low-income students.MORE:Quartz: When It Comes To Casting Models For Fashion Shows, Inclusivity Is InNextCity: Tracking Sickness Through a CellphoneThe What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.

In his opening monologue, host Andy Samberg accidentally-on-purpose confused ""wage gap"" and ""age gap"" between men and women to call out Hollywood's problem with both of those things. Amy Schumer's sketch comedy show beat a bunch of guys, while director Jill Soloway's ""Transparent"" also won big. Viola Davis made history.While this is progress, though, it's more of a small battle in a larger war for gender parity.Women of every color, of course, are still vastly underrepresented all over Hollywood -- behind the camera as well as in front of it. A 2015 study by the Women's Media Center revealed a striking gender imbalance among Emmy nominees in writing, directing, editing and producing categories in the past 10 years. Looking at nearly 50 subcategories, researchers found that women received just 22 percent of nominations over the past decade.  The numbers were particularly bleak in directing categories, where women comprised just 8 percent of nominees.But we already knew Hollywood sucked for women. This year was supposed to be better!Except it hasn't been -- not really. While individual women have (very deservedly) triumphed this awards season, the broader picture is still just as disappointing as ever.The Huffington Post looked at the same writing, directing, editing and producing categories as the Women's Media Center -- everything from Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series to Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing For A Limited Series Or Movie -- for this year alone. Out of all 2015 nominations in these categories, only 26 percent were given to women. That's better than the last decade as a whole, but not by much.But maybe equality reigned in the winner's circle?Nah. Out of 230 awards in these behind-the-scenes categories, women received just 72 of them -- a little less than one-third.And until there's gender parity behind the camera, don't expect to see gender parity in front of it. A 2015 study by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University pinpointed exactly why all of this matters. Researchers found that shows executive-produced or created by women also included more women writing scripts and playing onscreen roles. In other words, when executives unlock doors for women in the industry, women will hold them open for others. And when they don't, well, nothing changes.Hollywood put on a great show this year.

The story cited an unnamed “senior Vatican official” as the source of the offense.That really got the ball rolling, and in a cascade of tweets and blog posts, conservative Catholics and their allies voiced outrage at the “childish dig at the pope” and the “juvenile” and “deliberate insult” to American Catholics.“(T)he White House wants to deliberately embarrass the Pope by sticking a thumb in his eye, and by sticking their noses into Catholic doctrine and teachings,” Ed Morrissey wrote at HotAir.com.Even the editorial page of The Washington Post got into the act on Saturday (Sept. 19), writing that the Vatican “has raised objections” (a Vatican spokesman in fact noted that the Holy See does not as a matter of course comment on such matters) and criticizing the Obama administration for being willing to offend a kindly soul like Pope Francis while kowtowing to oppressive governments such as China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba.The president would never invite dissidents to receptions for those countries’ leaders, the Post said. (It did not mention that Francis is also being criticized for not meeting political dissidents and speaking out more forcefully on human rights while in Cuba.)The Post also said inviting Campbell insulted Francis because she criticizes church policies on euthanasia; Campbell said in an email she has never raised the issue or criticized the Vatican over it.“While I won’t have the opportunity to meet Pope Francis directly, I’ll be carrying in my heart many of the people that I’ve met on our Nuns on the Bus tours across this great country,” said Campbell, who is currently on a bus tour with other nuns to promote Francis’ teachings ahead of his visit.“These are the people Pope Francis cares about,” she wrote, referring to the struggling Americans she has met in various cities on the current trip. “These are the people we care about. Pope Francis knows the type of work we Catholic sisters do as we walk with the people, and we are grateful for his leadership bridging divides and transforming our political and economic systems.”On further review, maybe American conservatives and Obama critics are more upset than the pope they say they are defending.While the guest list apparently irked the Vatican official who spoke to the Wall Street Journal, several other church officials in the Vatican and the U.S. said privately they didn’t consider the issue a problem or worth coverage.They said there are far more important issues to think about in connection with the pope’s Sept. 22-27 trip to Washington, New York and Philadelphia, and they noted that the guests in question represented a handful of people out of many thousands.Administration officials also said the White House worked with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Archdiocese of Washington, Catholic Relief Services and Catholic Charities to distribute invitations to guests from around the country.Leading evangelicals and representatives of other faith groups were also invited, and many guests were told they could bring friends of their choosing.(Jewish representatives will be absent because the event falls on Yom Kippur, the sacred Day of Atonement. That timing was the source of scattered complaints, though most Jewish leaders dismissed such grousing and said they understood scheduling was difficult. Francis is to formally meet with Jewish and interfaith leaders Friday in New York.)It seems unlikely that Francis would have a major problem with Campbell.He has gone out of his way to praise the work of American nuns, whose social justice outreach seems to mirror his own priorities, and he ended a Vatican investigation of U.S. sisters launched under his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.Moreover, Francis last week named Sister Maureen Kelleher, a founding member of Campbell’s group Network, as a special delegate to a major Vatican summit on families next month.The pope has also welcomed gay people to the Vatican and invited a transgender man from Spain to meet with him at his private residence. He has met with advocates for LGBT Catholics and appointed a German bishop to next month’s Vatican synod who has suggested that the church bless gay couples.Just last week, a New York priest who ministers to gay and lesbian Catholics revealed that after celebrating Mass with Francis at the pontiff’s chapel in the Vatican, he gave the pope a DVD that tells stories about LGBT Catholics and their relationship to the church.“This is from the gays and lesbians of the United States,” the Rev. Gil Martinez, pastor at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, told Francis, according to Martinez’s interview with The Huffington Post.In chatting in the pope’s native Spanish about his upcoming U.S. visit, Francis told Martinez: “I would love to visit and talk to gay and lesbian people. And please tell the gays to pray for me, and I shall pray for them.”On Wednesday at the White House, the pope may be able to deliver that message in person — if he can find them in the crowd.(Editor’s note: David Gibson assisted Sister Simone Campbell in writing her 2014 memoir, “A Nun on the Bus: How All of Us Can Create Hope, Change, and Community.”)Also On HuffPost:"

Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) grabbed himself a moment in the media spotlight by declaring that he would boycott the pope's address to Congress because of its focus on climate change. Pope Francis' climate discussion ""has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into 'climate justice' and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies,"" Gosar wrote on Townhall.com.But Gosar's pontiff-pouting is excessive. Though his writings and comments on climate change, homosexuality and income inequality have earned him a reputation as ""the liberal pope,"" Francis isn't much different than his two immediate predecessors, journalist Tim Carney argued on HuffPost's ""So That Happened"" podcast.""If the pope got to vote in Congress and they got a voting scorecard, Francis would have looked like Benedict and John Paul,"" said Carney, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a columnist for the Washington Examiner. ""John Paul and Benedict would have been big liberals on economic issues and social conservatives, and Francis is a big liberal on economic issues and a social conservative.""Carney argued in a lengthy Examiner story that Pope Francis' apparent liberalism results more from a shift in emphasis than from any actual policy changes coming out of the Vatican.The Roman Catholic Church might be well known for its opposition to birth control and abortion, but the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops typically stakes out liberal positions when it lobbies on issues like unemployment insurance and nutrition assistance. These efforts usually fail to make news.As for Francis' recent letter giving all Catholic priests the discretion to absolve the ""sin of abortion,"" Carney said that U.S. bishops had already delegated such discretion to priests.""It was more of a symbolic action, and more about emphasis and tone than about any actual church policy in the U.S.,"" Carney said. ""But that symbolic action, that emphasis and tone, that's important. That's the biggest difference with this pope.""Also on HuffPost:"
14,SPORTS,Yet Another NHL Enforcer Appears To Have Died By Suicide,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/todd-ewen-enforcer-dead-dies_us_56001a08e4b08820d919521d,Todd Ewen died Saturday from what authorities say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.,2015-09-21,Todd Ewen died Saturday at 49 of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560042431c00002500082a7b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Police have decided to classify the death of former NHL enforcer Todd Ewen over the weekend as a suicide, the St. Louis County Police Department confirmed to The Huffington Post on Monday. The 49-year-old, who had a history of depression, died Saturday from what authorities say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.While information is still being collected about the case, the death of yet another NHL enforcer by apparent suicide could lead to louder calls for the NHL to do more to discourage teams from employing an enforcer, an unofficial “fighter” role that some see as inherently dangerous. (It should be noted the popularity of the position has declined some in recent years.)The enforcer is an unofficial role in hockey in which a player acts as a team's fighter. Ewen, who went by “The Animal"" during his playing days, was involved in well over 100 fights during his career, according to HockeyFights.com. The St. Louis Blues, one of four teams Ewen played with during his career, mourned Ewen's death in a tweet on Saturday.""We're sad to learn of the passing of former Blue Todd Ewen today,"" the team said. ""Our thoughts are with the Ewen family at this time.""The dangers of the enforcer position have received closer attention in recent years. In 2011, The New York Times published a three-part series on former NHL enforcer Derek Boogaard entitled, “Punched Out: The Life and Death of a Hockey Enforcer.”Boogaard, who suffered from depression, died of an overdose at age 28. After he died, he was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a brain disease thought to result from repeated head trauma and linked to depression and aggression. This was followed months later by the deaths of two other NHL enforcers, Rick Rypien and Wade Belak. Rypien, 27, also reportedly died by suicide. Police investigated Belak's death at the time as an apparent suicide, although Belak's family and friends have said that they believe the 35-year-old's death was an accident.At least five former NHL players have been found after their deaths to have CTE. But as recently as May, NHL commissioner Gary Bruce Bettman denied that a link exists between hits to the head and the degenerative disease. “From a medical science standpoint, there is no evidence yet that one necessarily leads to the other,” Bettman said at the time. “I know there are a lot of theories, but if you ask people who study it, they tell you there is no statistical correlation that can definitively make that conclusion.”The link is certainly clearer than that, and so the Los Angeles Times labeled the comments “stunningly irresponsible.” The Sporting News called them “mind-blowing” and compared Bettman to a “climate-change denier.” Chris Nowinski of the Concussion Legacy Foundation took to Twitter to ridicule Bettman as well.As CTE cannot be detected until after death, it is not yet known whether or not Ewen suffered from the degenerative brain disease.

And it may end up costing him a small piece of his ego.Exemplifying his legendary need-to-win mentality, Jordan texted friend Denny Hamlin last Wednesday and challenged the NASCAR professional to a race -- stating that he would admit that Hamlin is the better driver if he managed to pull out the W over Jordan.And in an unfamiliar turn of events, Jordan somehow came up short when it came time to race. Hamlin crossed the finish line first, then demanding that Jordan fess up and admit Hamlin’s dominance.As Jerry Bonkowski of NBCSports reports, Jordan said:""‘I know you’re headed into the playoffs and I just want you to know I’ve never admitted to anybody that anyone is better than me at anything, my whole life. But if you win this race this weekend, I will admit that you’re a better driver than I am.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’d be awesome.’”For Jordan, who had been in Monte Carlo since at least last Monday, this weekend’s defeat may have brought up memories of his rendezvous in Minor League baseball -- a one-year stint that marked possibly the last time he was less than the best in a competitive endeavor.Stay tuned for updates on whether or not Jordan actually admits to the loss.Also on HuffPost:"
16,ENTERTAINMENT,"Punk Rock Frontman's Drug Addiction Almost Killed Him, But He Lives To Scream About It",Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fidlar-interview-riot-fest_us_55f9b4a8e4b0b48f6701a9e8,"""Look at old punk rock dudes,"" Zac Carper said. ""They’re either dead or sober.”",2015-09-21,"Zac Carper of FIDLAR performs on stage at Heaven on June 23, 2015 in London, United Kingdom.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f9b56520000025002424f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Given that some of FIDLAR's best-known songs have titles like “Cheap Bear” and “Cocaine,” it’s hard to blame fans of the Los Angeles band, itself an acronym for “Fuck It Dog, Life’s a Risk,” for associating the skate punk outfit with a live-fast-die-young party-hardy ethos.But it wasn’t until very recently that most FIDLAR fans realized just how serious the partying had gotten, particularly for frontman Zac Carper.As Carper and his bandmates -- Brandon Schwartzel, Elvis Kuehn and Max Kuehn -- began doing interviews promoting the Sept. 4 release of their second full-length album, “Too,” that reality surfaced as songs with titles like “Overdose” and “Sober” required some explanation. Carper has not minced words about the turmoil that almost killed the band. And him.In conversations with music journalists from Vice, Spin and other outlets, Carper spoke in detail about how his struggles with addiction to a wide gamut of drugs -- including cocaine, meth and heroin -- and his efforts to, finally, sober up served as the source material for many of the songs. Carper’s newfound sobriety -- he’s been clean for over a year following six stints at rehab and a pep talk from Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, a fellow California punk who's dealt with addiction -- may have come as a surprise to some fans accustomed to the beer-slamming, YOLO-friendly party jams that dominated their successful, self-titled debut record, released in 2013. But in conversation with The Huffington Post backstage following the band’s high-energy set at Riot Fest in Chicago, Carper said he couldn’t imagine it any other way. “I was a fucking junkie and a meth head for like the whole [previous] tour cycle and after doing this record I was like, I just gotta be honest,” Carper explained. “I’ve felt so much better saying in the press, you know what, I don’t get fucked up anymore.”Some fans have reached out to him to share that they’ve dealt with similar substance abuse problems, but there’s also been some backlash, of course. Others seem to liken the news of Carper’s struggles to something of a buzzkill -- Carper’s sister told him that one person on the band’s Facebook page called him a “fucking narc,” he laughed.“I’m not going to let that fuck with me. This is the only fucking thing I know how to do and I love doing it,” Carper said of the negative comments. “It’s the classic, especially in punk music: ‘Oh, God, he’s sober, album’s gonna suck, man.’ Look at old punk rock dudes. They’re either dead or sober. Really, there’s no fucking in between.” Fans and music writers alike who have latched onto the band’s party-centric tone have been missing the point all along, Carper argues. Their coverage in the press has been a source of frustration for him.“The way that the first record turned out, the press really pushed that we were the skater-party-punk people but that wasn’t the case with us. … I never preached getting fucked up,” Carper said. “All the songs were just shit about shit I was going through. A lot of people make assumptions and I’m half to blame here -- I wrote songs called ‘Cocaine’ and ‘Wake Bake Skate’ and ‘Cheap Beer’ -- but I just wish people would just take the songs and interpret it for themselves and not think it’s, like, who I am really.”Compared to the mostly loud, relentless jams on FIDLAR’s first album, many of the songs on “Too” take a slower and more nuanced approach.The result is a sort of aural hangover. A handful of songs -- like “Punks” and “West Coast,” which originally appeared on a 2012 EP the band released -- wouldn’t have felt out of place on that first album, while its darker, more confessional moments -- like the mid-album trio of “Sober,” “Overdose” and “Leave Me Alone” -- are new territory for the band. They make for some of the album’s finest, most unexpected moments.The self-deprecating lyrics on these songs dive into Carper’s experiences with overdosing on heroin a reported three times in one month, his intervention -- when a group of friends and family members gathered and told him, “Dude, you’re fucking dying” -- and his mixed feeling about sobriety. The band worked with a producer, the Nashville-based Jay Joyce, for the first time on this album and Carper credits Joyce with how those songs turned out. “Sober,” he added, wouldn’t have been on the record were it not for Joyce’s influence. The song deals with Carper’s reaction to his girlfriend at the time breaking up with him over the phone while he was in rehab.Though they cover darker subject matter than FIDLAR's older work, songs like the regret-laden “Stupid Decisions” fit in seamlessly with the older, lighter material in the band’s Riot Fest set. The band's fans crowd-surfed and pumped their fists in the air.The contradiction between playing songs including the lyrics “I’m spending all my cash on cheap cocaine / And I’ve been wasted, every day” and the newer songs in live sets today is not lost on Carper. Channeling the emotions behind songs written about the darkest moments of his life serves a function “like therapy” for him, he said.It's not all gravy, of course. Life on the road comes with a minefield of triggers -- he admits he misses ""getting fucked up” -- so he deals with lingering temptations by listening to a lot of music and helping produce records for other bands while on the road. He’s already produced work for bands including the Frights and Swimmers and is also working on a new album for the Australian band Dune Rats. He is also in ongoing therapy to help him along in his recovery.But all things considered, Carper said the sober life is getting better each day. He described the band as tighter than ever and said he finds it easier to connect with fans at shows now that he’s not using. He also believes the band’s live sets are stronger than when he was high. “I’m really grateful I’m not fucking sticking heroin up my ass and smoking meth,” Carper said. “You can’t shoot dope like a gentleman. You can drink like a gentleman, you can smoke weed like a gentleman, but once you start shooting dope.. That heroin chic thing never worked for me.”"
17,POLITICS,Obama Explains Difference Between Police Reform And 'War On Cops',Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-police-reform_us_56002672e4b0fde8b0cefcdd,"“We want to protect our police officers. We’ll do a better job ... if our communities can feel confident that they are being treated fairly.""",2015-09-21,Demonstrators protesting police brutality march past police officers in New York City at a May Day rally.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama on Saturday applauded the “outstanding work” of law enforcement as he called for criminal justice reform during a speech at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner.“I just want to repeat, because somehow this never gets on the TV: There is no contradiction between us caring about our law enforcement officers and also making sure that our laws are applied fairly,” Obama said. “We want to protect our police officers. We’ll do a better job doing it if our communities can feel confident that they are being treated fairly. I hope I’m making that clear.”Obama's comments follow accusations from Republicans -- and Fox News -- that the president and police reform advocates are stoking violence against law enforcement. GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) criticized Obama earlier this month for his silence about the so-called ""war on police"" that is allegedly ripping our nation to shreds. “Cops across this country are feeling the assault,” Cruz said after he was asked about the death of Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Darren Goforth in August.“They’re feeling the assault from the president,” the Texas senator continued. “From the top on down, as we see -- whether it’s in Ferguson or Baltimore -- the response of senior officials of the president, of the attorney general, is to vilify law enforcement. That is fundamentally wrong, and it is endangering the safety and security of us all.”But Cruz missed some important details in his critique. Obama reached out to Goforth's family in August and released a statement on the deputy's ""unacceptable"" death, vowing to continue highlighting the ""uncommon bravery"" the nation's police officers exhibit. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), another presidential candidate, also skirted this fact a week later, claiming that Obama’s “absence of leadership” was to blame for the violence.“In the last six years under President Obama, we’ve seen a rise in anti-police rhetoric. Instead of hope and change, we’ve seen racial tensions worsen and a tendency to use law enforcement as a scapegoat,” Walker wrote in an op-ed for Hot Air, a conservative blog site. “This inflammatory and disgusting rhetoric has real consequences for the safety of officers who put their lives on the line for us and hampers their ability to serve the communities that need their help.”But the truth, according to statistics, is that it's not any more dangerous to be a cop now than it has been in years past. In fact, 2015 is on pace to have near-record low levels of deadly violence against police. Twenty-four officers have been shot and killed in the line of duty so far this year, according to Officer Down Memorial Page, an independent nonprofit that tracks cop killings. That's a 26 percent decrease from the same time period in 2014. And there have actually been fewer year-to-date shooting deaths of police officers in 2015 than in nearly every other year in the past two decades. The lone exception was 2013, when the FBI says killings of police hit a 50-year low.These statistics follow a broader trend of declining rates of assault and deadly violence against police in the U.S.The increasing focus on civilian deaths at the hands of police has sparked much of the current debate. According to The Guardian, officers have killed 845 people this year, 63 of whom were black and unarmed. The Guardian includes people who were shot, shocked with stun guns and struck by police vehicles, as well those who died in police custody.These numbers have attracted attention because they're far above the official statistics traditionally released by the FBI. In 2013, for example, police shot and killed 461 felony suspects in justified homicides, according to the annual FBI Uniform Crime Report. Official numbers on homicides by police -- whether they're ruled to be ""justified"" or not -- have long been challenged as incomplete, and critics are questioning them again as the independently tracked total of homicides by police in 2015 approaches twice the official figure for 2013. Obama also touched on this topic during Saturday's dinner.“We can’t avoid these tough conversations altogether,"" he said, noting that the issue of police officers killing unarmed civilians is not new, just more well-known thanks to the proliferation of video cameras and social media. ""That’s not going to help our police officers -- the vast majority who do the right thing every day -- by just pretending that these things aren’t happening. That’s not going to help build trust between them and the communities in which they serve.”Obama then turned his attention to the broken criminal justice system, saying that it serves as a “profound barrier to opportunity” for many Americans. He mentioned the inmates he visited at a federal prison in Oklahoma who shared stories of how incarceration has reduced their opportunities for brighter futures and left their families without husbands, fathers, sons and brothers. “Mass incarceration rips apart families,” the president said. “It hollows out neighborhoods. It perpetuates poverty.”As most Americans focus on the 2016 presidential election, Obama said he’d be working on sentencing reform. “It’s the right thing to do for America,” he said.Watch Obama's entire speech below: "
18,POLITICS,Chris Christie Stood By Nomination Of Muslim Judge Despite Attacks From 'Crazies',Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-muslim-judge_us_5600202ee4b00310edf7c09b,"In 2011, Christie hit back against conservatives who didn't want Sohail Mohammed to be a state judge.",2015-09-21,"At his swearing-in ceremony in 2011, Sohail Mohammed held up a copy of his citizenship papers. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_258_2700_1302%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In recent days, GOP presidential candidates have been making news for their suggestions that Muslims, somehow, aren't fully American.Ben Carson asserted on Sunday that a Muslim person should not be president of the United States. Donald Trump also said he isn't sure whether he could support a Muslim in the Oval Office, and argued that there is a ""very severe problem"" with some Muslims in this country. Last week, Trump also faced criticism for not pushing back on a questioner at one of his town halls who said Muslims are a ""problem"" in America and charged that President Barack Obama practices Islam. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) so far hasn't weighed in on the controversy, but the 2016 GOP contender has faced past criticism from his party on this issue for another reason: He stood by his nomination of a Muslim man to be a state judge, despite concerns from some Republicans that the man was a terrorist and would implement Sharia law. In 2011, Christie nominated Sohail Mohammed for a seat on the New Jersey Superior Court of Passaic County. Mohammed was an immigrant from India and rose to prominence as a leader in the Muslim community. He helped the FBI understand Muslim culture, and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he spoke out against the government's targeting of Muslim and Middle Eastern individuals.""Sohail worked effectively and very appropriately with the U.S. Attorney's Office (of New Jersey) and the FBI in bridging relations and providing outreach with the Muslim community,"" Michael Drewniak, Christie's spokesman, said at the time. ""And he did it at a time when federal law enforcement in New Jersey needed someone like him to do that.""But Christie and Mohammed quickly faced attacks from some conservatives. Conservative writer Debbie Schlussel said Christie ""rewarded those Muslim mobs who cheered on U.S. soil for the mass murder of 3,000 Americans with a judgeship."" Steve Emerson, who runs the Investigative Project on Terrorism, said Mohammed was ""a longtime mouthpiece for radical Islamists."" Other conservative bloggers said Christie was ""in bed with the enemy"" and had put New Jersey on a path ""toward becoming the Sharia State."" Mohammed faced similar treatment when he went before the state's Senate Judiciary Committee. Legislators asked him to define the word ""jihad"" and to state whether he ever objected to the term ""Islamo terrorist.""Despite these attacks, Christie stood by Mohammed. During a press conference in August 2011, Christie said flat-out that the criticism of Mohammed had nothing to do with his background and everything to do with the fact that he was Muslim. ""They are criticizing him because he is a Muslim American ... Sharia law has nothing to do with this at all -- it's crazy! It's crazy. The guy’s an American citizen,"" Christie said.""This Sharia law business is crap. It’s just crazy, and I’m tired of dealing with the crazies,"" he added. ""It's just unnecessary to be accusing this guy of things just because of his religious background.""The New Jersey legislature did end up confirming Mohamed to the bench. He is still a judge in the state.Christie's campaign didn't return a request for comment on whether a Muslim can be president. But in an interview with NBC on Friday, he said Trump shouldn't have let the questioner's comments on Muslims go unanswered. ""I wouldn't have permitted that if someone brought that up at a town hall meeting of mine. I would've said, 'No, listen, before we answer, let's clear some things up for the rest of the audience,'"" he said. ""And I think you have an obligation as a leader to do that.""Also on HuffPost:"
