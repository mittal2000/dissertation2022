Massive protests calling for Rousseff's impeachment on Sunday have narrowed her options to fend off political and economic crises, but her ouster remains highly unlikely, analysts said Monday. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1477e240000320024fbb2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Brian WinterSAO PAULO, March 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's popularity fell to a new low in a poll released on Wednesday, weakening her even further at a time when she is facing public calls for her impeachment and trying to push austerity measures through Congress.Sixty-two percent of respondents rated the leftist leader's government as ""bad"" or ""terrible"" in the nationwide poll by Datafolha. That's up from 44 percent last month and single digits just two years ago, when the economy was still growing.Just 13 percent of respondents rated Rousseff's leftist government as ""great"" or ""good."" The remainder, about 24 percent, described her government as ""OK.""It was the worst popularity rating for a Brazilian leader since 1992, shortly before President Fernando Collor was impeached for corruption.Many Brazilians are upset by rising inflation and unemployment, as memories of last decade's economic boom seem ever more distant. Prosecutors say that more than $1 billion was misappropriated from state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA in a corruption case that is still unfolding.Roughly 1 million people demonstrated against Rousseff in dozens of Brazilian cities on Sunday, with some protesters calling for her impeachment.Opposition leaders have said impeachment is unlikely since Rousseff has not been personally accused of wrongdoing in the Petrobras scandal. However, the opposition has asked the Supreme Court to further investigate her role in the scheme.The Datafolha poll showed Rousseff's popularity had fallen in all income groups, including her working class base.An increasingly hostile Congress has pushed back against Rousseff's efforts to cut spending and hike taxes. Investors have said such measures are necessary to keep Brazil from losing its investment-grade credit rating as a likely recession this year saps revenues.Apart from Collor, other Brazilian leaders have recovered from similar declines in their popularity.Fifty-six percent of Brazilians gave President Fernando Henrique Cardoso bad marks in September 1999, following a currency devaluation, and while he remained unpopular he was able to push through some reforms before leaving office in 2002.Datafolha surveyed 2,842 Brazilians across 172 municipalities between Monday and Tuesday. The margin of error is plus or minus two percentage points. (Reporting by Brian Winter; Editing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal and W Simon)"

Thanks!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e9f6a2600003300805a52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I had a striking and sudden realization last year when I was in Australia talking to a good friend. The people who receive what they want in their lives don't have a secret hidden talent or good luck. They ask for what they want. How simple! Asking is not the only thing you have to do (you certainly have to be a giver first and a do-er and follow through-er) but asking can make a huge difference in our lives. It became so clear to me as I replayed in my mind all times that I had seen people voice what they want and then get it -- from romantic relationships to career opportunities to advice, even access to events or help from strangers.Asking makes us vulnerable, I understand. But if we don't ask the answer is always no. People who get what they want are afraid to ask just like the rest of us but the difference is, they ask anyway. And they contribute a lot, too. Such is the awesome law of reciprocity. But so often we are happy to give but feel uncomfortable or guilty about getting. Reflecting on this, I created a list of 31 things that I have asked for with positive results by age 31:1. My now-husband to take my phone number during the concert we met at. 2. Considerable salary increases when my work performance is strong. 3. A hug from Jake Gyllenhal in a downtown New York City restaurant. 4. Discounts -- from bananas at a street vendor (when I am 50 cents short) to international flights to cable packages. 5. A little kindness from a woman who I saw being rude to a yoga studio assistant. 6. Forgiveness -- many times. This has been perhaps the most important request of my life. 7. The table I want in a restaurant. Everyone pays the same, so I like typically request a window table or cosy corner spot. 8. Publication of my work from some of the most prestigious online publishers. 9. Millions of dollars throughout my corporate advertising sales career. 10. Coffee with someone I want to meet (taking initiative in new friendships is an important skill when you move around the world). 11. More reliability from a guy I used to date (he never was and it was short-lived -- better to know sooner, darlings). 12. Media interviews with Bethenny Frankel, Arianna Huffington, Kris Jenner, Kelly Osbourne and Sara Blakely. 13. To purchase something that is not for sale (a friend's jacket, a mirror in an outdoor market). 14. A job in New York City with no network, no local experience, a pending work visa and an incomplete college degree (I received two awesome offers and accepted the highest paying). 15. What I need from my husband on a regular basis (I love quality down time together). 16. A seat on the subway when someone is taking up unnecessary space. 17. Positive feedback when I need it. 18. Free samples from retail stores when I buy something. 19. Referrals for the vision board events I lead. 20. Favors from friends (from dog-sitting to their help in setting up a party to a ride to the airport). 21. Clarity on expectations from managers (ambiguity in the workplace is rampant.) 22. Permission to dig deeper on an emotional issue if I can sense a friend needs to talk about something. 23. Asking people to lighten up in a ""crisis"" -- such as an internet power outage at the office. Where did the fun go? 24. Free late checkouts at any hotel -- 90 percent of the time this works. 25. Honesty from others about my work -- even when it hurts! 26. Punctuality (since when is it okay to be so late)? 27. If I may go first in a group presentation setting -- to get my nerves out of the way. 28. Reduced prices in exchange for loyalty and/or sincere online reviews (dry cleaners, movers, spas). 29. Asking myself, ""What the hell am I doing? This needs to change!"" This question has arisen when my life needs a course correct. Wrong relationship, wrong job, too much partying. You have to get real with yourself every so often. 30. Asking how I can help -- from a friend going through a breakup to a mum with a stroller who can't fit into a bathroom stall in Bloomingdales. 31. A divorce from my first husband. But that's another topic!It's important to note that as long as this list is -- I could write an equally long list of rejection (longer, even). But that is the thing. Without asking for what you want you have no list -- apart from a mental list of regrets. Pay attention to anyone you really admire -- they will have had plenty of failures behind them. But they still did something. They took risks. They identified what they wanted and asked for it. No business success, no engagement story, no change in this world took place without someone asking for something first. And it all begins with you.

We wondered, too. So we conducted a a nationwide survey of nearly 4,000 gay men last month to gauge their behavior. It was no ordinary survey -- not with questions like, ""Have you ever sent a dick pic?""Our purpose for the survey was simple: To help you compare your dating app experiences with other gay men. Check out our analysis below the infographic. Before we get into the delicious data (and it is yummy), a couple of things about the survey: Nearly 4,000 gay men ages 18-65 participated over the course of four weeks in February of 2015. This survey was not commissioned, nor sponsored by or for, any of the gay dating or hookup apps. We conducted the study for our own use.Okay, let's dive in. We see a couple of things that make our pincers rub with glee. Let's start with the most scandalous and work our way down:83 Percent of Gay Men Have Sent a Dick Pic.  This is, by far, the most shocking statistic in our survey. Receiving dick pics (whether you asked for them or not) is a rite of passage on the apps, but 83 percent? That means almost everybody on the dating apps has taken the time to pose their penis (to add an optical inch or two, natch), store it on their phone and send it off to strangers they are likely never to meet. Is that a sign of sexual liberation or plain old exhibitionism? You decide.31 Percent of Gay Men Lie About Their Age, Height or Weight.  A bitter queen once told us that certain gay men lie and cheat so much you have to count your teeth after they kiss you. We don't know about that, but it does bring up a question-is this rate of self-reported cheating higher or lower than you would expect? We think it's about right, given the results of studies on straight men using dating apps, which show about the same amount of self-reported misrepresentation.45 Percent of Guys Who Actually Meet Don't Hook Up.  In other words, almost half the time two guys meet, one of them says, ""Thanks but no thanks."" The high number of bail-outs might surprise some, given that two strangers who've spent a fair amount of time trading pictures (including their penises!), texting, and one assumes, sometimes talking on the phone or Skyping, would NOT end up in each other's arms. On the other hand, it might be understandable given the amount of lying about age, height and weight (see above). If you thought you were meeting a young hottie and the guy that shows up is so old he owes Jesus ten bucks for the lumber, you're probably going to bail.50 Percent of Guys Who Agree to Meet Do It in Their Homes.  Giving a complete stranger your street address and greeting him at the door could be seen as brave or stupid, depending on your point of view. Given that 45 percent of encounters don't end up in a hookup, one assumes there are a lot of very awkward moments across gay America's living rooms when the door knocks and you don't like what's on the other side of it.30 Percent of Gay Men Don't Need to See a Face Pic to Meet Up.  Is this indicative of the down low meeting the down low, or just another example of plain ol' junkyard dog scrumping, where looks don't matter, but orifices do? Probably a little bit of both.  The results of our survey show a vibrant, insightful, sometimes hilarious look at how gay men act on dating apps. But it shows an uglier side, too. Like a strong strain of racism and HIV stigmatization. To see the complete results of our survey please click here.Michael Alvear is the founder of grabhim.net."

Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) (C) speaks at a press conference held in an effort to extend the James Zadroga 9/11 Health & Compensation Act for a further 25 years before it expires, on September 8, 2014 in New York City. The bill ensures that those effected by the September 11th terrorist attacks are able to receive treatment and monitoring for all 9/11 heath related issues through 2015. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ee2f1f00000002257c00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrats in the House and Senate plan to introduce a bill Wednesday that would guarantee workers the right to request flexible work arrangements without being punished by their employers.The legislation, called the Flexibility for Working Families Act, would not force employers to grant such arrangements, but it would require them to discuss the possibility of one with the worker and take it under consideration. If the employer determined that flex time or telecommuting was untenable, it could decline to grant it to the worker. But an employer who fired a worker or cut hours because of such a request could be fined by the Labor Department.Sen. Bob Casey (D-Penn.) and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), the lawmakers sponsoring the legislation, said the goal is to foster an environment in which workers are comfortable requesting schedules that accommodate their family lives. “Flexible work arrangements help businesses retain great employees and help workers remain in the workforce while meeting their obligations to their families,” Casey said in a statement. “This is commonsense legislation that brings our workplace laws into the 21st century.”Similar laws already exist in other countries, including Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. Democrats have introduced versions of the bill in the past without success.The legislation is all but certain to go nowhere while the GOP controls both chambers. Republicans in general have balked at putting any new regulations on businesses, and they’ve made a point of trying to block new workplace standards involving the Labor Department or the National Labor Relations Board.Maloney and Casey, however, argued that the workplace flexibility proposal was modest.“You shouldn’t have to fear getting fired just to request a schedule that is workable in terms of daycare arrangements, regular medical appointments or life’s other obligations,” Maloney said. The Flexibility for Working Families Act should not be confused with the very similarly named Working Families Flexibility Act, which has been introduced before by Republicans. The latter bill would allow eligible workers to opt for “comp” time rather than overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. Though Republicans say the proposal would help workers balance their family needs, Democrats say it could lead to employers coercing their workers into taking time off rather than receiving time-and-a-half pay.Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, said the two bills reveal highly different visions for how to encourage flexibility in the workplace. Her group supports the Democratic proposal and opposes the Republican one, but she said she’s glad to see Republicans discussing an issue that's long been the domain of Democrats.“I do think the positive thing here is we're increasingly seeing both Democrats and Republicans identifying a fundamental problem, which is that our workplace policies don’t reflect the needs that working families have,” Shabo said. “At this point, Democrats and Republicans just have very different solutions in mind.”"

The international agency, which counts Puma and eBay among its clients, will call itself ""iitasLBi"" for a week.

Boehner answered a range of questions relating to the Republican proposed budget during the press conference. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ee322000000f0201da02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Since taking control of the House in 2010, Republicans have crafted dozens of bills ostensibly devoted to ""streamlining and simplifying"" the federal government. They've pushed them through the lower chamber, promising to cut red tape and create jobs. But on Tuesday, they let the cat out of the bag. These bills, it turns out, are essentially efforts to undermine Wall Street reform and Obamacare while greenlighting pollution.Much of the House GOP's jobs package is devoted to legislation requiring various forms of ""cost-benefit analysis"" on new regulations. Critics, however, have repeatedly noted that agencies already have to perform a host of economic impact assessments before making rules. They argue that these bills are really only interested in emphasizing costs. The benefits of regulations, after all, tend to be longer-term and hard to quantify, while costs are relatively easy to figure out. When you curb pollution and give people access to health insurance, it saves lives -- something far more difficult to assign a dollar value than the upfront costs to corporate interests.House Republicans posted their budget bill Tuesday, and it includes a ""statement of policy"" -- see page 123, Section 810 -- that makes the critics' points for them. It decries the ""468,500 pages"" of new regulations the Obama administration has promulgated, and claims that regulatory efforts are running up an annual $2.03 trillion tab on the public. There is no mention of any benefits, economic or otherwise, that have accrued from any rule.After bemoaning these abstract costs, the GOP then makes clear what they're really upset about: Obamacare, the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and Environmental Protection Agency rules on carbon emissions from burning coal. No other legislation or regulatory initiative is mentioned. While the Republican budget bill decries ""unnecessary red tape,"" the only examples it can find of such inefficiency just happen to be the signature domestic policy achievements of the Obama administration.""The House GOP budget enacts radical and extreme 'regulatory reform' measures that are better termed 'deregulatory reform,'"" Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate for the nonprofit group Public Citizen, told The Huffington Post this week. ""If these measures were to become law, the public could expect... inaction on climate change and another Wall Street meltdown.""Remarkably, this GOP push to gut Wall Street reform, repeal Obamacare and protect polluters has garnered Democratic support in both chambers of Congress. In the Senate, corporate-friendly lawmakers including Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) have co-sponsored Republican bills that seek to saddle regulators with additional cost-benefit requirements. In the House, several conservative Democrats -- including Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), co-chair of the New Democrat Coalition -- have voted for at least one version of the GOP attack on the regulatory state.The strategy for using cost-benefit analysis to undermine regulators dates back to former House Speaker Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in the 1990s, and the GOP has tried to revive and revamp one of Gingrich's key achievements in that vein during the current Congress.While none of these Republican deregulation efforts have been enacted, the GOP has had tremendous success in the courts by pursuing the same line of attack with existing cost-benefit requirements. Conservative power lawyer Eugene Scalia, son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has overturned key Dodd-Frank rules in court by insisting that agencies didn't properly weigh the corporate costs of financial fairness or stability.On the other hand, when it's time to write new measures that deregulate industries, Republicans have tended to show some impatience with the economic analysis process -- urging the Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, to expedite rules deregulating Wall Street securities sales under the so-called JOBS Act.

The Washington bill, which would have outlawed parents from citing personal or philosophical beliefs to exempt their children from vaccine requirements, failed in the state House on Thursday after its author missed a key deadline, according to the Sacramento Bee. A similar bill in Oregon, which also would have banned parents from using religion as an exemption, died Wednesday after its author, state Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward (D), said she didn't have enough votes.Steiner Hayward expressed frustration that vaccine effectiveness continues a subject of intense debate. ""She is disappointed that the conversations have largely revolved around who is right or wrong about science and the benefits vs. risk of vaccines, rather than about the health and well-being of Oregon’s children,"" said a statement from Steiner Hayward's office emailed to Seattle radio station KPLU.A similar bill remains afloat in California, one of 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions.Polling suggests that Americans are largely in favor of making it harder to opt out of vaccines. According to an online survey conducted by Reuters/Ipsos last month, 78 percent of respondents said that all children should be vaccinated ""unless there is a direct health risk to them from vaccination."""

(Photo by Fred Lee/ABC via Getty Images)TIM GUNN",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dfaa6250000350036aafd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I wish Tim Gunn could live with me. Specifically, I wish that every time I felt like a complete mommy failure, the fabulous Project Runway star could just appear, a stoic presence in some cute little pinstripe suit, all six foot two of him, bearing his usual words of wisdom and a clean pocket square to dry my tears with. He would pick me back up, outfit my children in looks fit for Suri Cruise, and -- voila! -- we'd make it work together.This idea recently came to me when a good friend, about to have her second child, asked me for my best advice for handling two kids together. I quickly recalled one day in particular when my youngest was still a newborn. One afternoon, my older daughter, who was still mastering potty training, ran into my bedroom, saying, ""Mommy, mommy, mommy! I can't...."" -- and then she peed all over herself in front of me. I had a newborn baby stuck to one boob and couldn't do a darn thing about it. At the time, a dear friend of mine texted me, ""At least you know urine is sterile,"" and somehow, that made me laugh and I was able to make it work. When I finished feeding one child, I was up and getting paper towels and fresh clothes for my other kid. It's just what you gotta do.We all have our own ""make it work"" moments and stories. My mother-in-law likes to tell me about the time she was ridiculously exhausted, like near comatose, and watching six kids at once (her four, her sister's two) one afternoon. She dozed on the sofa while they drew in crayon on her new wallpaper. Her thought, before she let her eyes close: ""I can always paint over it."" She made it work, people.It's what we all do as parents. We make it work. Every day. Whether we go to work or stay home, whether we juggle one, two or more than three kids. Whether we live in houses, apartments, on communes or campsites. We all have to make this thing called parenting work.So, here's where Tim Gunn comes in. He's always trying to get the Project Runway designers to see that even if they lack the proper supplies (who knew taffeta was so pricey?) or don't have enough time to finish sewing, there's always something else that can be done to make the situation work. And if it's not perfect, that's OK, too.Is your little one pooping in her pants on the playground? Make it work, he'd say.Toddler kicking you in your pregnant belly and yelling, ""I don't want a new sister""? What's that you hear? ""Make it work.""Eleven o'clock on a work/school night and your kids are still awake? Oh, you actually need to get some ""actual"" work done? You know what I'm gonna say: ""Make it work.""Nobody wants a bath? Make it work, my friends.Your kids' babysitter tells you she doesn't know who Punky Brewster is when you reference the '80s child star. You old hag! Stop crying and make it work!I cannot count the multitude of times when I need to just make stuff work -- because anyone with kids knows from experience that you cannot plan worth shizz when it comes to kids. Someone gets all cranky, someone's wheels start to come off in the middle of a grocery store aisle, someone gets puked on, and that's it! Plans? Out the door!That's when it's time to channel an inner Tim Gunn and say to no one in particular (or, heck, say it to that crazy lady who just told you your daughter needs to be wearing a hat in this weather!), ""I can make it work.""Take me this morning. I woke up to my 5-year-old flicking my nipple and asking in a snarky voice, ""Mom, what's this thing?"" She had pulled down my pajama shirt and was just staring at me. Later, her younger sister let forth an epic Number Two during a close commute on a crosstown bus.Guess what I did? I called upon my inner Timmy G and I made it work.In all seriousness, though, wouldn't life be so great if we could just make it all work? If we could actually be OK with whatever came our way while parenting -- instead of fighting the incessant urge to control everything?Why, as parents, are we so worried about this concept? Making it work means admitting defeat, in a way, doesn't it? But it doesn't have to.Throwing on the TV instead of reading three books aloud because you actually have something else you need or want to do while you're with your kids? Why do we, as a culture, think of this as akin to showing the kids porn or feeding them cat food for dinner? We are that crazed about being perfect parents that we can't just let stuff work the way it's gonna work sometimes.And, you know what, it's not gonna always work the way we want or hope or ever expect.What Tim Gunn (and anyone else who tries to ""make it work"") is actually telling us to do is to forgive ourselves, to accept our greatest parenting triumphs and the things we perceive as the fails. Tim Gunn says ""make it work"" -- and we can be confident that we can and will. The only one who can make this parenting thing work is you.So, next time the parenting racket has got you down, get back up and make it work, people! We've got a runway show to produce and some kids to raise! Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact HuffPost ParentsAlso on HuffPost:"

(Photo by Nicole Craine/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0856240000320054d205.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I would have loved to see President Obama, the First Lady and their beautiful girls in Selma, Alabama linking arms with Rep. John Lewis and other brave civil rights pioneers who took that historic walk over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965. The presence of our African-American first family marking the anniversary of this triumphant struggle was incredibly poignant and inspiring in itself. But for me, the most astounding part of the day was the president's powerfully inclusive, hopeful, and no-nonsense speech as he called for us to take more ground. He painted a clear, non apologetic but hopeful picture of America while speaking directly to the revisionists, the racism deniers and those in our country who seem bent on retrenchment:That's what America is. Not stock photos or airbrushed history or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others. We respect the past, but we don't pine for it. We don't fear the future; we grab for it. America is not some fragile thing; we are large, in the words of Whitman, containing multitudes. We are boisterous and diverse and full of energy, perpetually young in spirit.All I could think of when I heard these words, was how our president's understanding of race in America has become more nuanced since his famous speeches at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and in Philadelphia in 2008. He did what he does better than any of our country's leaders -- reminded us of the strength and resilience of America's diverse peoples, while this time weaving in the deeper and confounding truths about our history of injustice toward each other.""We're the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South. ""We're the ranch hands and cowboys who opened the West, and countless laborers who laid rail, and raised skyscrapers, and organized for workers' rights. ""We're the fresh-faced GIs who fought to liberate a continent, and we're the Tuskegee Airmen, Navajo code-talkers, and Japanese-Americans who fought for this country even as their own liberty had been denied...  ""We are the gay Americans whose blood ran on the streets of San Francisco and New York, just as blood ran down this bridge... ""We are Jackie Robinson, enduring scorn and spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to his head, and stealing home in the World Series anyway.""Despite all he has suffered while in office, including the outrageous racist behavior directed toward him by so many, he still deeply believes in our country's ideals and is firm in his belief that we are mistaken if we insist there has been no progress on racial issues. At the same time he made clear that the ""more common mistake is to suggest...that racism is banished; that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the 'race card' for their own purposes."" He actually said, ""race card!"" Last weekend, we saw a black president who has revised his understanding of just how strong the bigotry in this country is and how much more must be done for our country to reach its ideals and secure a better future. He called us to task, reprimanded us for not taking advantage of our right to vote after so many had sacrificed to secure it, and then encouraged us to seize the ""new ground that is yet to be covered and the bridges to be crossed.""I have been thinking about what it takes to do just that -- to be a bridge builder in the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King and those courageous Americans in Selma, to bridge the gap between our country's reality and ideals, and inspire the rest of us to live up to the promise. What is the bridge builder's response to Attorney General Holder's report on Ferguson, Missouri -- released the same week of this beautiful celebration of our country's civil rights' progress -- that documents the systemic discrimination and mistreatment of black people, brown people, and poor people? How do we build trust when people in power refer to the first family in derogatory, racist terms? Who stands in the gap now? I think our president thought he could be a bridge builder, coming from so many diverse identities and experiences but the current political climate has made that all but impossible. As someone like the president, a person from a working class background who benefitted greatly from the sacrifices made by Americans during the civil rights movement, I've been reflecting on what I have learned working to foster more inclusive and respectful companies, organizations and communities. I don't believe that either physical violence hateful speech, or shame and blame will work. The shooting of police will never lead to trust. When I see people square off on television news programs, I don't see us making progress in mutual understanding, only staking out positions while we refuse to look for common ground.Bridge builders are those who seek first to understand rather than to be understood. They go beyond their cultures and world views to understand the world view of others. In instances where they disagree with the beliefs and behaviors of others, they don't demonize them and distance themselves from them. They move toward the ""other"" seeing the individual and his or her culture as valid, as worthy of respect; the other is still human. They look not only at what seems to be wrong, but at the joys, the strengths, the value, the history, the resilience and the power in each community and culture. Bridge builders are humble enough to know they don't know everything. That their experience while valid, nevertheless means they are at the same time unaware of the experiences and lives of others, especially those who have encountered rougher waters in our society. They are curious about what they don't know. They are willing to make the emotional investment of listening deeply to the pain and anger that comes from the communities of people on the other side of the gap. They are people who bring a spirit of collaboration rather than control.Rather than seek it, bridge builders bring empathy and compassion. Is it our American ""bootstrap"" mentality that makes it so hard for us to show empathy to others who are different from us? Is it our fearing of returning to poverty or our ""let's keep moving forward"" attitude? If we hope to build connections across difference, we have to find ways to walk in another person's shoes. There is a quote from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow that I keep on a card on the wall by my desk because it helps remind me of the power of empathy, ""If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's (or woman's) life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility."" Being a bridge builder is not easy. And being self-aware, active, respectful, humble, and empathic are qualities that don't get a lot of play on the front page. But the secret that bridge builders know is that their endeavors are not solely about doing something for others -- they secure safe haven for each of us. Bridge builders are not altruistic, do-gooders. They are deeply connected to the truth that we are all one, all connected within these United States and across our world. That what was happening in Selma, or is taking place in Ferguson or in Syria, New York or Nigeria is happening to all of us. As Dr. King, one of the most remarkable bridge builders of our time remarked, ""I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states... injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be.""And what we ought to be, as the president reminded, us last week is, ""We the people""- a nation of people who want justice not just for our group, or own city or neighborhood - ""but for all."""

García was unarmed and reportedly had his hands in the air shortly after stepping out of his vehicle.On Friday, March 6, another officer shot and killed unarmed African American Tony Terrell Robinson, Jr. in Madison, Wisconsin. By the following Monday, around 2,000 people were out in the city's streets protesting the shooting death, holding a large banner that read ""Black Lives Matter.""Interestingly, the same day of the protest, Robinson's uncle, Turin Carter, gave a family media statement that explained his nephew was not just ""black."" He described Tony as ""black, white, he's a mixture of everything.""""I encourage everybody to show support regardless of race,"" continued Carter, ""because this is truly a universal issue."" Police brutality is an issue that everyone should be concerned about, but especially since U.S. law enforcement generally finds it easier to take ""non-white"" lives.The deaths of Tony Robinson, Rubén García, and numerous others reflect a difficult past and shed light on our present struggles with race in the United States. The routine police violence against Latino, Indigenous, and African American men highlight how state officials treat ""black"" and ""brown"" bodies under the law.The current atmosphere of police brutality shows that many men of color continue to live in a police state in the 21st century United States. When racial profiling, police brutality, and general discrimination are proven to be systematic in our society then we should all be pushing for actions that create change together.""Are You Going to Kill Me?""Without downplaying that law enforcement heavily single out African American men, it needs to be recognized that police target other men of color as well. Last month, police in the U.S. shot and killed at least three unarmed Mexican nationals.One of these killings took place in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas, where a dashboard camera recorded rookie officer Robert Clark pulling over Rubén García after a brief car chase. The 31-year-old García steps out of his vehicle, puts his hands in the air, and asks: ""Are you going to kill me?"" García begins walking towards the officer who yells profanities while telling him to stop moving.Family members who have seen the video say that García's body language was peaceful and that he was nervous. After he steps out of the camera's view two shots go off, which hit García in the chest. The father of four children died from his wounds.The officer was unharmed. García was unarmed.""If my husband had killed a police officer, he would be in jail,"" said Marta Romero. García's widow continued, ""but since it was the opposite, will they just leave it this way?"" Questioning the mistreatment of undocumented people in the U.S., she asks: ""What are human rights then?""Suspect: ""Male Black, Light Skinned""Exactly two weeks later in Madison, Wisconsin, officer Matt Kenny responded to reports of a ""male black, light skinned"" who was ""yelling and jumping"" in traffic. The police dispatcher radioed that ""apparently, Tony hit one of his friends"" and that there were ""no weapons seen.""Officer Kenny went to the apartment that 19-year-old Tony had entered and while outside said he heard a disturbance coming from inside the apartment. Around this time the dispatcher received another call from someone reporting an assault within the apartment. An officer on the radio can be heard saying ""we have to enter"" and then Kenny forced his way into the home.Apparently a struggle ensued where both men sustained injuries. Officer Kenny's injuries have not yet been released. Robinson ended up shot and died from his wounds.Officer Kenny was armed. Robinson was unarmed.""White Mother of a Black Child""The deaths of Tony Robinson and Rubén García show that law officials use lethal force against men of color who might not identity themselves as ""black."" Like many ""black"" men, these two men were both on the margins of society.Turin Carter explained that Tony ""felt a misfit for most of his life"" and his nephew's ""identity was formed because of his racial ambiguity."" As he spoke to the media, Carter highlighted the mixed background of his family who stood around him.Tony's mother, Andrea Irwin, was present and Carter described her as ""a white mother of a black child, black children, who have white and black relatives."" Speaking about her son in a separate interview, Irwin said that she ""doesn't know how to live without him.""A similar situation arose last September when Susan Hunt, also of European heritage, claimed police in Utah used excessive force when they killed her African American son. Police shot Darrien Hunt six times as he brandished a samurai-type sword -- the fatal shot was in his back as he was running away.Darien's mother claims that ""no white boy"" would be shot like this for carrying a sword. To Susan Hunt it was clear: ""They killed my son because he's black.""The Darien Hunt and Tony Robinson killings show that families of multiethnic men might view their children in different ways, yet society and police often see them as menacing ""black"" males.Whose Lives Matter?While Tony Robinson's uncle understood that the police categorized his nephew based ""off his appearance,"" Carter still took the time to explain to the media that ""there's no way you can look at Tony, or any of my nephews, and be able to determine 100 percent what we are in terms of our heritage and our ethnicity.""This may be true, yet this is what we often miss: ethnic heritage and race are two different things.While Tony may have personally identified as a person of mixed ethnic heritage, being ""light skinned"" did not save him from being racially profiled as ""black."" Race is how police matched the young man to a ""black"" male suspect description and it may have also played a role in why the officer perceived Tony as such a great threat.It's important to realize that Tony Robinson's family was not trying to distance themselves from ""blackness"" by acknowledging their ""complex heritage."" They actually made a point of connecting Tony's death with the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner this past summer.""We don't wanna stop at just Black Lives Matter,"" said Carter, ""because All Lives Matter."" In this way, the family is trying to bring others into the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement. Broadening the scope of involvement, while retaining the message that racial discrimination needs to stop, is a positive way to gain allies.Law enforcement also often mistreats the poor, homeless, and the mentally ill of all backgrounds. However, many times these victims are also people of color. That's why it's important to recognize that the fight against police brutality begins with ""black"" and ""brown"" bodies and extends to others.Why We All Must FightEach case of law enforcement using lethal force is different and we need to carefully examine evidence before jumping to conclusions. Still, there's a problem when a pattern of deaths result from police who are supposedly following regular codes of conduct.The use of procedural force by law officials has shown itself to be systematically flawed. Therefore it's time to change how officers engage suspects, especially men of color.Certainly, police can use tazers, pepper spray, or shoot non-vital areas on an unarmed suspect when they feel threatened. Making these judgment calls quickly is not easy, yet when it gets to the point where an officer shoots dead a naked African American man with no weapons, then we need to reevaluate the system and call this what it is: murder.Police departments that routinely target men of color (see Ferguson and undoubtedly many others), and college fraternity students that proudly shout the N-word while glorifying lynching African Americans from trees, are disturbing reminders that we need to battle entrenched, systematic racism.Police brutality is just one area that proves that words do not just sit harmlessly in our heads. Racist emails and songs that are repeatedly passed along help to inform and form our beliefs. These ideas have real-world effects on people's lives.We might not be able to measure exactly how much a racist view makes it easier to draw a gun or pull a trigger, but we can say one thing: bigotry helps.The U.S. has long been a police state for Latinos, Native Americans, African Americans, and other men of color. Police brutality is a reality today. The only debate needs to be on how best to change it. If we are going to push back against future growth of militaristic policing in the U.S. then we will all need to get behind this important struggle together."

Photo credit: World ArcheryMany archers have tattoos of bows and arrows, and these beautiful works of art do more than decorate skin. For many, tattoos mark milestones and achievements, or serve as reminders to keep working toward goals and dreams. For others, tattoos capture the archery spirit that inspires so many of us.Miranda LeekMiranda Leek represented the United States in the 2012 Olympic Games and the 2011 Youth Olympic Games.Few people know about Miranda Leek's tattoo, which she had inked a few months after the London 2012 Olympics. She wanted ""something that would be unique to me and my history in the sport; basically, unique to my life.""The rings represent the Olympics. The black arrow with pink fletching is a nod to Leek's start in archery through her father, who fletched 5-year-old Miranda's arrows in pink. She chose the phoenix, which was used in the Games' closing ceremonies, because a phoenix never really dies. ""When it gets old, a new one is born from the ashes,"" she said. Like the phoenix, her ""Olympic journey will never die,"" but ""it may change forms."" She will always be an Olympian.John StubbsJohn Stubbs has been on the Great Britain Paralympic Squad since 1997, and is the current Double World Para-Archery Champion. He won gold in Beijing 2008 at the inaugural Games for compound archery.Stubbs' tattoo highlights his participation in the London 2012 and Beijing 2008 Paralympics. His red stars stand for his World Championship gold medal, and the gold star for his Paralympic gold.""The Agitos and Olympic rings together mean equality, because we all work very hard for the same goals,"" he said. His tattoo represents 20 years of archery training.While he usually doesn't show his tattoo, he adds to it with each success, which helps keep him motivated. ""We all have those down days when we're hard on ourselves, but I can use my tattoo to remind myself what I've achieved and it picks me up,"" he said.Not everyone who gets an archery tattoo is an Olympian. All kinds of archers engrave their archery passion on their skin.Chuck CooleyChuck Cooley, National Field Archery Association (NFAA) touring pro, is known as a co-founder and vice president of Feather Visions. He has been the NFAA's announcer, and was a technical adviser for the recent NBC Sports TV reality show NockOut.Chuck's tattoo mixes his personal history and spiritual connection to archery. His tattoo depicts a piece of cave art. It's supposed to appear as if you're looking through a hole in a cave wall and seeing the art.The tattoo shows a bowhunter and two deer. The dark one represents all the stories and memories of a hunt, and the white one is his ""spirit deer."" The white deer has appeared to Cooley three times in his life, and only when he was hunting with his kids. The first time it appeared as a yearling after Cooley reconnected with his son on their first trip in the woods together after a multi-year separation. The second sighting came two years later while he was with his son and a friend. The third sighting came a season ago when he joined all three of his kids in the woods at the same time.The rest of the tattoo depicts the footprints of each animal he has taken with a bow: bear, coyote, turkey and whitetail. It also features a flint-knapping stone and knapped broadheads sitting on a stone shelf, as if left by a cave-dwelling artist. The top-center tattoo shows an arrow stabbed into stone like Excalibur's sword. It bears his wife's name to symbolize their permanent bond.Hampstead BowmenCliff Capps and Ewa J. Lind of the Hampstead Bowmen marked their archery passions with inspiring ink.One of Capps' tattoos features the logo of his local club, the Hampstead Bowmen.The other is a Swedish saying that presents archery as an allegory for life. It translates, ""I'd rather listen to the sound of a bowstring breaking than never draw a bow!"" Lind, Capps' partner and fellow club member, wouldn't be outdone. For her 50th birthday, she captured the magic and beauty of arrows with a tattoo of an arrow encircling her upper arm.Compound Archers and Their ArrowsArrows are a popular theme in archery tattoos. Kseniia Shkliar, a Ukrainian compound archer, sports a beautiful ribbon quiver on her leg to show her love of the sport and her seven years of competitive shooting. Stephanie Gallagher commemorated her years as a USA Archery team member and professional compound shooter with a lovely patriotic arrow.Jon Bach, inventor/founder of Loc-A-Peep and coach/owner of X-Ring Archery in Lambertville, New Jersey, mixes his many loves with his tattoos. The first tattoo, an arrow, features his four children's initials. He says the ""dot"" in front of the arrow reminds him to ""keep focused on the important things in life."" The forearm arrow highlights the Loc-A-Peep logo and serves the dual purpose of advertising the peep sight he invented.Do you wear ink to show your love of archery?

Terry grew up in Texas and started his musical career in El Paso being mentored by his friend and another Texas legend, Bobby Fuller (I Fought the Law). After Bobby Fuller's death, Terry moved to Memphis and was hired by Steve Cropper to work at the Stax Records studio. His career as an engineer and producer included working at Ardent Studios and Abbey Road and then joining Island Records founder Chris Blackwell at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas for many years.Terry has produced or engineered artists such as Led Zeppelin, ZZ Top, Shakira, Lenny Kravitz, Joe Cocker, Wattstax, Alex Chilton, Big Star, James Taylor, Leon Russell, Jason & The Scorchers, Rhino Bucket, George Thorogood and The Destroyers, Joe Walsh, Johnny Winter, The Rainmakers, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Molly Hatchet, The Angels, Johnny Diesel and The Injectors, Jimmy Buffett, Crash Test Dummies, Shania Twain, Bryan Adams, Widespread Panic, and many others.Terry has recently returned to his roots as a recording and performing artist, recording his critically acclaimed 2013 tribute album to mentor Bobby Fuller, West Texas Skyline. His most recent release is Heaven Knows on his Lucky 7 imprint through ECR Music Group. Castle: You are releasing Heaven Knows, a new artist album. That's a brave undertaking in the current environment. You also recently released West Texas Skyline, your tribute to Bobby Fuller. Speak a little about your inspiration to make these records and what's the creative direction. Terry Manning: Ha, I guess it isn't exactly the ""best time in music history"" to be going back to being an artist, rather than always working for everyone else as a Producer or Engineer. BUT I don't look at it as, ""When is it a good time,"" or ""What will the market think of this?"" I just do what I feel like I need to do musically to satisfy that inner desire all music makers have to release the emotions from inside, and hope that, in a perfect world, they find someone else, and perhaps touch their heart in some way.I started out in music as an artist (usually as a member of a band however), but then, because of circumstances, whatever talents I had seemed to be co-opted by other artists, and I wound up producing or engineering or composing for everyone except myself. ""Not that there' s anything wrong with that,"" of course; it was fun, musically rewarding, and fortunately provided a living. But always there in the back of the mind is that nagging thought, ""What about what you always wanted to do? What about YOUR music?"" Of course, in this world we don't usually get to do just what we want, so I worked for years on other people's music. Finally, it dawned on me that if I didn't get things moving, I would never get back to where I always meant to go! It's just like work if you don't get started, there is no way you can ever finish.So, being at a stage of my life and career where I now had a bit more flexibility to choose the projects I wanted to work on for others, but to also schedule some time for myself, I knew it was time to ""get going."" The Bobby Fuller tribute album was a good way to get into things again, doing mostly songs associated with Bobby (by the way, he was my first music mentor when I was a young teenager), while I worked on writing new songs for myself. I actually recorded the Heaven Knows album right after finishing West Texas Skyline, they just couldn't release it that quickly. It was a period of massive creativity, working on things I was more excited about than ever. Eighteen hour days, day after day, and so happy to be back where I had begun.The inspiration and creative direction of West Texas Skyline is pretty obvious I guess; I was paying tribute to not only Bobby Fuller, but also to HIS influence Buddy Holly, as well as the people, places, and the times of Southwest Texas in those heady days of wild rock & roll. Even the two original songs I wrote for that one (Cold Night In Heaven and West Texas Skyline) were about those very topics.But much more involved was the inspiration and creative direction for Heaven Knows. There, I wanted to explore the human soul, especially the capacity for love. I wrote about the various stages of being in love, of the yearning for requitement, of the situations in which one displays love, etc. We all undergo life changing events from time to time, perhaps meeting a new person, or finding a new job, or moving to a new city (or even country), any number of things. At times one of these can also affect who and how we love. Shortly after one particular incident, I was inspired to write about it, and literally within just a few minutes, the song Heaven Knows was fully formed. It was like it was dangling out in space in front of me, and all I had to do was catch it, write it down, and record it. All of that happened almost at once. That song inspired another (It's You), then another from that, and it just kept going...searching ever deeper and deeper into the meaning of what we all as human beings feel inside.Castle: I know that Compass Point Studios closed, tell us a little about the studio's history.Terry Manning: Yes, both for better, and for worse. We of course were one of the most iconic recording studios ever, and not only were many wonderful recordings made there, but we also had just tons of fun doing it. Almost everyone ever associated with CPS, artists, employees, visitors even feel a sort of ""familial relationship"" to the whole thing. Chris Blackwell of course (founder of Compass Point and of Island Records) would be very responsible for that. He is such a wonderful man, kind and giving, and totally the lover of musical artistry. But at the same time, it was also very much a service industry. By definition we were there to serve OTHER people, other artists.Again, that was wonderful, almost every minute very enjoyable and fulfilling. But I had done it for a lot of years. The music industry was changing as well, but despite things being tougher than ever for studios, we were blessed with both an enviable history and a beautiful location. However after a couple of incidents happened which were a bit disturbing (local socio-political type things), we decided we should not continue as a public studio in The Bahamas. Chris and I own the brand name, and we are, and will continue using it for certain things. Whether we will ever have a PUBLIC studio again (in another location) is debatable, but we will continue the name and the legacy. Yes, it was sad to see it go in many ways, and yes, we had to cancel almost a year's worth of bookings when we closed it, but on the good side, it has given me the freedom of time to do, amongst other things, my own music.Castle: There's been a lot of commercial pressure on the album as a format ever since iTunes launched. Digital services may like the idea of the musical oeuvre but they seem to think more multi-artist playlist than single artist album. Do you feel that pressure as an artist? Did you ever question whether you should record an album? Do you find this question comes up with artists you work with as a producer or engineer? Terry Manning: Wow, good questions. Yes, the industry has changed a lot. In some ways it has gone back to where it was in the 50s and 60s, more single oriented, with multi-artist playlists (sort of like AM radio in the day). However, I don't think the album concept is dead at all. An album (originally a literal multi-paged album book with 10"" 78s put into the envelope-pages, like photographs) is the best way to express a complete musically philosophical thought. One song could do it, but how much better is it to take a concept, and fashion 40-50 minutes worth of music around it? At least that's what I like to do!I do love the immediacy of the digital world, the ability to make something one day, and have it available to the whole world the next that was never possible before. Of course the big question is, how to get people to know about it, listen to it, want it, and then hopefully buy it? I can see the validity of releasing a song at a time, and maybe some time I will do that as well. I just really like the album concept statement, there's nothing else like it.As for discussing this with production or engineering clients, yes indeed, especially with artists I am producing. One would be foolish to ignore the marketplace and how it operates. Still, I find most artists also look to the album as a total concept.Castle: If you were starting out as an engineer today, where would you go to learn your craft? Terry Manning: When I was getting started, there were no ""audio engineering schools,"" and probably not even any courses in that discipline at the ""regular"" universities. You had to find someone to mentor you, which meant in most cases meant working in a studio that had professionals already doing the job. In my case I was very fortunate to run across great mentors like Bobby Fuller, Steve Cropper, John Fry, Al Bell, Willie Mitchell, Booker T, etc. Most people aren't that lucky I guess. But, what to do today?There are the dedicated ""Engineering Schools,"" several of which are quite popular. As good as some of them are, I usually don't recommend to people who ask about it that they go to one of those. There are thousands upon thousands of people going that same road, and the ""degree"" you get at the end of it may vary from a piece of paper printed in house to a partial ""real degree."" I usually recommend that people go to a ""regular"" university that also offers a program in audio technology, and if they are up to it, also go into the music school. There's nothing like a real degree from a fully accredited university, something which shows that, in addition to the specialized training received in engineering and/or music, you have a fully rounded education. Or perhaps something like what Berklee has become, that offers multiple disciplines.But still, there is no substitute for working in a real functioning recording studio where all sorts of different types of clients are coming in every day, all of the work has the pressure associated with it of pleasing the customer, you end up climbing underneath equipment to solve a problem ON THE SESSION, etc. The sad part is, that's harder and harder to find today, and more and more people are clambering for the positions.Whatever, I'm so glad I am not starting out today! But if you don't try, you will definitely never succeed.Castle: If you wanted to start a recording studio today what does it take in the studio business to survive and even be successful? Terry Manning: The basic criteria of pleasing the clients will never change. You have to be professional, clean, prompt, and ready to adapt to any situation. Our control rooms at Compass Point would change setups almost daily. One day a rock band doing a normal session, the next an ADR session for a film, the next a massive keyboard setup in the control room, the next a 5.1 surround mix...literally whatever. So adaptability is a big key, as is of course competency in your craft. Situations change quickly, equipment breaks, a noise springs up out of nowhere you must be able to adapt, and with calmness and aplomb. Never let the client know things aren't perfect!Now, also there is nothing like market research and a business plan. No matter how much fun this is, or how excited someone gets about having a bunch of cool gear installed, or hanging out with rock stars, nothing matters if at the end of the day you can't at LEAST break even. So you need to look at the city you are in, and decide, hopefully with good information and research, how much business you can actually get; and determine what your costs will be relative to your income. This IS a business, after all; that's why they call it ""The Music BUSINESS."" It's both at once, music and business!And yes, it's perhaps harder than ever in some ways. There's more competition, including home recordists, and a smaller pool of label clients. But it's also less expensive than ever to put in something that is competitive, equipment-wise, if you are smart about it. Still, there is no substitute for a good sounding acoustic environment and good solid high end equipment to achieve high quality.Castle: What's your view on the role of a producer in an artist's career in the current environment? Has the producer's role changed over the last 10 years? Terry Manning: The role of a True Producer will never change. In an ideal world, on an ideal project, a good Producer will be bringing out the very best OF an artist, from what the artist has inside them whatever it takes. Sometimes that means just inspiring the player or the vocalist, and sometime it might mean going all the way to ""fixing"" them where needed, as long as it's in the intended spirit of the song.Now today, things have changed somewhat. Many people are calling themselves ""producers"" when they might not have gathered the requisite skills or credentials. That's fine, but it is only semantics. The proof is always in the pudding: How good is the music?But the basic skills required for the job are the ability to see things in both a microscopic and a macroscopic view at the same time, the taste to discern a great performance from a merely very good performance from a poor performance, and ideally, musical skills, will always be the definition of a truly good Producer.Castle: There's a popular meme online that anyone can download free software off the Internet and make a record in their bedroom that sounds as good as the Beatles. This skips over the engineer part, but a lot of people think that's generally true. Since you worked at Abbey Road, how would you respond to that kind of statement? Terry Manning: Oh yes, I hear this all the time, and I say, ""More power to them!"" Time will certainly differentiate the wheat from the chaff.Of course you can spend about $1000 and get everything you need to make some sort of recording. And a few with very great talent might even make a good recording from such equipment. After all, a great song and excellent musical and production skills trumps ""gear"" any day.But how many people operating in such an environment have the skills really needed? Not many. And even fewer can do great performances. And even fewer than that can write a great song. Now, having gotten through this not inconsequential part, as I've said before, there is no substitute for a good sounding acoustic space. And very few bedrooms or garages come with a great acoustic design built in. Working at a place like Abbey Road, or Compass Point, or any of several other iconic studios can only be a further advantage. Just because you can order some medical instruments online, should you perform your own surgeries? Or extract your own wisdom teeth? And just because you can go down to AutoZone and buy car parts, are you automatically a great mechanic?I wish everyone in every recording situation the best of luck, but luck alone, paired with a laptop and some cracked plugins, does not a great recording make.Castle: We hear a lot about the damage that piracy and low royalties have done to artists but rarely ever hear from producers and engineers. What is your experience over the last 10 years or so? Are producers and engineers working about as much as they were before the Internet? Terry Manning: Hard for me to say, because I do work all the time. Maybe I'm just lucky, or maybe I have earned enough of a reputation to get the work, I don't know. I hear various stories from out in the field. Some are working a lot, and some are hurting for work.But there is no doubt that piracy has had some negative effect on the music industry. As long as the labels aren't selling near as many copies of things as they used to, and therefore lower amounts of revenue are coming in, that affects how much they will be able to spend making future product. That passes down the line to less work for studios, for studio musicians, even the music stores and other industries that cater to studio recordists. None of this is good.On the other hand, as we've said before, decent recording gear costs less, music can be made for less cash outlay, and the Internet provides an amazing platform for release. So there are good things and bad things about the industry today.But the piracy thing, and in a somewhat similar vein, the steaming outlets with their infinitesimally small pay scale, are certainly not helping foster a robust music industry like we had in some years past.Castle: Back in 2002, I worked with Leslie Lewis when she was director of the Producers & Engineers Wing of the Recording Academy to get SoundExchange to accept letters of direction so producers could get a share of webcasting royalties. It seems like SoundExchange is one of the only recording royalty streams that producers can count on these days. Do you find that producers are aware that they can negotiate a share of webcasting royalties? Terry Manning: Actually, no. I don't think many people are aware of this, producers included. The money may not be huge (yet), but it's certainly better than nothing! I myself would like to hear more about this, just to be sure that everything possible is put in place. I'm glad someone is trying to help make things right!After all, every one of us can say #IRespectMusic."

I remember climbing into the soft, plush leather seats with plenty of room to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. I especially liked the seat divider that would separate my younger brother Tommy and I from each other, on long rides to visit family or friends.  As I watched the Oscars recently, I was so drawn to Cadillac's new advertising campaign that takes a bold stance for those who approach their career and lives in innovative and sometimes disruptive ways. Not a common approach for an iconic brand and a 112-year-old car company that's built its reputation on luxury and comfort - not on doing things differently. Today, that's obviously changed.Personally, I have to offer kudos to President of the Cadillac brand, Johan de Nysschen, for owning this reinvention and profiling the people who have defied the ""norm"" in their new Dare Greatly campaign. As his letter to supporters and critics alike stated, ""Only those who are willing to accept risk, who have the courage to dare greatly, shape the future. . ."" and ""drive the world forward."" Agreed! Not an entirely new concept given but one that is steeped in American history, however rarely discussed as being an exceptional or accepted position. Once used as an adjective to describe high-end products - like Xerox was to copies, Kleenex to tissues, etc. Cadillac said luxury, high end, and evoked images of a primarily older male market (at least in my mind - I'm sure due to the fact my dad was a fan). Not so today, if Melody Lee has anything to say about it. Lee is the Director of Brand and Reputation Strategy for Global Cadillac. Lee is a millennial who's being charged with regaining the Cadillac's brand reputation and moving it beyond that of just an automotive brand, but a brand ""period.""Clearly, Cadillac's goal is to attract a new generation of consumers who resonate with the new branding strategy of daring to follow their passion like Steve Wozniak, and be who they truly are - like fashion designer Jason Wu. Wu credits the support of a mother who dared to allow her son the comfort in himself and tools necessary to follow his dream. This messaging got my attention and has made me look at the Cadillac brand in a new and positive way. What does your ""brand"" say about you? Is it time you step out of your old comfort zone? Clients have called me a Reinvention Catalyst because one of my specialties is helping people redefine themselves and update their brand to stay relevant in today's fast paced, ever changing media outlets.Until I saw the ad on the Oscars, it wasn't top of mind to take a Caddy for a test drive. I might now though. I dare you to as well.While you're taking off on new ventures, test drive my free Reinvention Road Map and let me be your guide."

Villarreal's BS degree is in biochemistry from California State University, Los Angeles. His postdoc was in virology at Stanford University where he worked with Nobel laureate Paul Berg. Our interview follows. Luis Villarreal: In decades of research and teaching of virology I've heard stories about the 'going away' of viruses, beginning in the 1970s. That was when we eradicated smallpox in the world. The polio vaccine campaign had tremendous strides. Measles, and so forth were on the wane. Many predicted that studying virology would soon be a historic topic. Then HIV made its presence known.  Many million human deaths later we accept that viruses don't go away. They just keep coming. This evolutionary reality now has us scrambling. HIV, this little virus of 10,000 nucleotides of RNA, has defeated the combined technologies of the planet since it emerged decades ago, and we still don't have an effective vaccine or way to prevent its transmission. This just demonstrates the massive evolutionary power these entities have.Suzan Mazur: It's clear to me from reading your papers that you have issues with neo-Darwinism.Luis Villarreal: The issues first came up when I began looking at quasispecies in the early 1970s. I was a researcher in the lab of the late John Holland, where there was real enthusiasm for studying evolution theory in the context of actual virus measurements, because the whole concept derived from thinking about RNA viruses.  I wasn't interested really in evolutionary theory at a deep level. I was interested in persistence, and for this the Modern Synthesis didn't seem to be working. I just assumed that the theory didn't apply or work in the specific situations we were studying involving persistence, such as VSV, rabies and measles. But the more I got into the research, neo-Darwinism appeared to be working less and less. After I left that area of RNA virus research and began investigating SV40/polyoma virus with Paul Berg at Stanford, that's when it really struck me that a shift in evolutionary thinking was required -- because I realized that these were viruses that make their living by being persistent and stable entities that are essentially part of the host. The theory we had at the time to explain that relationship did not make any sense to me. And that's when I started on my current path.Suzan Mazur: Neo-Darwinism made no sense.Luis Villarreal: Right. In terms of selfish individual types, runaway replicators, and that whole set of related concepts.Suzan Mazur: You open your recent New York Academy of Sciences paper on viruses by saying: ""All living habitats (including prebiotic ones) have and must operate in a virosphere (a network of infectious genetic agents)"". That's pretty sweeping.  Luis Villarreal: Yes, I stick with that statement. I will argue with anybody on that point.I'd like to define what I mean by a virus, which is a molecular parasite dependent on its host for its maintenance and replication. A virus can also infect another virus, which then becomes its host. Fundamentally, this definition is symbiotic because it has embedded in it dependence on others.Suzan Mazur: You've also noted that ""most experimental paradigms seek to eliminate or have ignored viruses"" and you've advocated that evolutionary science now ""adopt a virus-first perspective.""I want to focus on the science in our interview, but obviously, politics comes into play here. Would you talk about that?Luis Villarreal: Absolutely. That whole issue of politics--Suzan Mazur: What kind of resistance do you see among evolutionary scientists to accepting a virus-first perspective? Luis Villarreal: There are actually relatively few formally-trained evolutionary scientists who will accept the virus-first perspective. I've encountered a couple. I'm immersed in a population of traditional evolutionary biologists here at Irvine. They just dismiss it. They don't even want to think about it. So it's not a prevailing perspective. But it's one that I think much better explains the foundations of observations, especially now that we have metagenomics informing us about the character of genetic entities -- how lineages and genomes change.Suzan Mazur: Scientists don't want to take the time to study it?Luis Villarreal: It's some of that. They very much believe in their theory, and the theory comes first and the observations come second. This is an issue with Manfred Eigen, for example. Eigen has developed a nice theory and career based on this approach. When this happens the science becomes not very available or open to experimental correction. Of course, if it weren't for Manfred Eigen perhaps we wouldn't have pursued the path of viruses the way we did. But Eigen's book published last year, which covers the history of quasispecies thinking, etc., with in-depth mathematical model and evaluations, is completely missing references to a generation and a half of experimental results virologists have accumulated -- many of which are not really terribly consistent with what Eigen is arguing.  Esteban Domingo and colleagues in Spain have written a really fantastic review of the last 20 years of virus experimentation. But Eigen doesn't refer to any of it in his book. It's what can happen when a scientist believes their own theory too much.Suzan Mazur: It should be evidence first.Luis Villarreal: Which is the perspective that I adopt.Suzan Mazur: While we're on the subject of politics, I follow you all the way to the end of your New York Academy of Sciences paper ""Force for ancient and recent life: viral and stem-loop RNA consortia promote life"" -- which you call your ""gangen"" paper because of your perspective of viruses as consortia -- until I get to the concluding paragraphs where you make reference to the work of Nilesh Vaidya and Niles Lehman. I interviewed Vaidya at Princeton two years ago about his work on ""recombination events to produce autocatalytic sets,"" as he described it to me, and I ran that interview online. Vaidya has since his 2012 Nature paper on that subject with Niles Lehman redirected his research interests. It is unclear why.Luis Villarreal: I can't actually answer that, but I have suspicions, and they're social in nature. When you make an experimental inference that confronts fundamentally these well-entrenched views - it makes a career very difficult. I got to a position in my career where I was able to extricate myself from a lot of those consequences. Somebody just starting out would be hammered and out of business.   Suzan Mazur: Lehman's work had been supported by the late Harry Lonsdale for several years. Lonsdale's reviewers cited lack of results in 2014, one noting: ""[E]ven if apparently recombined sequences are detected, it will be difficult or impossible to trace their genesis.""And regarding your mention of a so-called ""autocatalytic ribozyme"" in your NYAS paper with reference to Lehman's research - Nobelist Jack Szostak has told me this about autocatalytic sets: ""Autocatalytic sets is one of those concepts where the people who came up with the original idea, like Stuart Kauffman, rather than admit being wrong kept changing their story until it was basically the same concept everybody was already working on.Luis Villarreal: I've had some conversations with chemists along these lines, which gets into a distinct domain of thinking. They drift into more complicated catalytic outcomes where you just don't have a linear relationship of A to B to C. A to B to C is typically how chemistry is taught. To deny the existence of the nonlinear is not an effective way of thinking about things.Suzan Mazur: Vaidya references Kauffman's concept.Luis Villarreal: That may be, but my point is more fundamental. In order to create a system that has participants that interact and can form an identity as a group, it has to have these characteristics I've described or outlined in the paper that you and I have been discussing, the NYAS ""gangen paper,"" which is consistent with a lot of these attempts to get catalytic RNA to function in a population.  Suzan Mazur: So you're saying more traditionally-trained chemists just don't get it, they want to see the molecules.Luis Villarreal. Yes, I would say that. In fact, you might want to talk to Vera Kolb at the University of Wisconsin. She's a professor of organic chemist and is interested in origin of life issues and has been active in astrobiology. Vera was trained along traditional lines but thinks in more complex ways with respect to how origin of life occurred.  Suzan Mazur:  Nick Hud, a Georgia Tech chemist who is trying to find the simplest molecules needed to start life -- a precursor to RNA -- says he's got ""a molecular assembly that is perhaps one bond away from making it a polymer - a covalent polymer."" Hud told me, ""[There is a long history of people proposing autocatalytic cycles and thinking that such cycles are central to starting life, but then not getting much to work in the lab.""Luis Villarreal: It' a difficult transition to the nonlinear because it's not how we traditionally do these kind of experiments.  The cooperative stem-loop RNA business has had some successes experimentally. Some of those observations I incorporated in the NYAS paper.Suzan Mazur: Corrado Spadafora, who's found evidence of a germline crossing of the Weismann barrier in his experiments, now questions whether a Weismann barrier even exists. He supports your thinking, telling me this:""([E]ndogenous) retroviruses have contributed to shape our genome, are constitutive components of it and are currently playing crucial roles in fundamental processes such as embryogenesis, tumorigenesis and, in the long run, evolution."" And František Baluška at the University of Bonn's Institute of Cellular & Molecular Botany has noted: ""Infection, especially the viral one, but also bacterial and fungal infections, followed by symbiosis, is proposed to act as the major force that drives biological evolution toward higher complexity.""  Baluška told me viruses ""manipulate adjacent cells to form cell-cell adhesions.""Animal biologists bristle at the idea of cell-cell adhesion linked to viral infection and viruses, one animal biologist cynically describing them to me as ""intelligent viruses.""Luis Villarreal: When people use terms like ""intelligent viruses"" -- it is one thing to have a competence, code competence, communication competence that viruses essentially must have in order to function, but if that transitions into a concept of intelligence, that becomes problematic for me. Suzan Mazur: Do viruses have an effect at only the microscale or is their effect apparent at the mesoscale and even macroscale?Luis Villarreal: Well, what is the effect of the Ebola outbreak on the human culture and human condition? Ebola is a specific example to think about because the bats have acquired a very unlikely bit of information from Ebola itself, and they did so with the help of another virus, probably an endogenous retrovirus, because it turned that RNA into a DNA and deposited it into the chromosome -- which is what had to have happened. It's not something that a virus can do by itself. It has to have cooperated in a rather complicated way. But my point is that as a consequence, the adaptions that must occur are at all these different levels -- in the context of the immune system, in the context of the culture, in the context of the behavior -- all of this is affected by these events.  Suzan Mazur: But in terms of form. Spadafora mentions embryogenesis and you make some reference in a previous paper to the embryo.Luis Villarreal: The systems biologists have immersed themselves in this issue quite a bit because they are characterizing all the transcripts that have occurred in the early stages of development -- 1, 2 cell stages. If you just look at the math, at the amount that is being expressed or transcribed without consigning meaning to it, you see that on a very large scale these parasitic sequences, these endogenous viruses, virons and all of these retroposons are very highly expressed at these points of development and commitment. Some of these are entities that were acquired in a lineage specific way so that you see them in primates or you see them in chimps or you see them in humans. You don't see them necessarily in sister species. So it's clear that some editing events mediated by infectious agents have occurred at the very earliest stages of commitment and differentiation. They are occurring on a significant scale. These are not minor numbers. They're quite abundant.Suzan Mazur: So it affects morphology.Luis Villareal: Absolutely, yes. But in ways we are just beginning to tease apart. We don't really understand how, for example, the large mass of non-coding RNAs is doing what it's doing.  Suzan Mazur: If your gangen hypothesis is correct, which is that gangs, i.e., ""RNA collective ensembles coupled with the emergence of endonuclease, ligase, cooperative catalysis, group identity and history markers (RNA) are needed for life to emerge"" -- what happens to the current thinking?Luis Villarreal: It means that sphere of logic is not sufficient to understand this collective. Because if you think about how the collective must operate, in fact, it becomes even a problem of language.  You can always trace a linear link between any two participants or any three or four or five participants in a collective. But if it has a conditional character to it. . . If you think of alu retroposon RNA in the human brain and it has a particular activity or function and a particular neuron, and it's doing a specific activity of connecting to some other cell, but then you see in another state, say during learning and memory where it is doing something different and can actually oppose the activity that you saw in the first state -- this means an individual entity has multiple activities. And that's the character of a consortia, which means you now have to start thinking in terms of how the population works and not by just these linear nodes that represent the end reactions. Because they have a conditionality associated with them.Suzan Mazur: You've noted that during evolution 3.3 gigabases of DNA, which is the current size of our genome, was once retrovirus, that there are about 330,000 solo long terminal repeats of retroviruses now in human DNA. You've also said these long terminal repeats (LTRs) ""contributed to reregulating about 1,500 genes needed for the placenta to emerge."" In terms of percentages how much of today's human genome is virus and how are you able to measure this?Luis Villarreal: The definition of what is virus is a little bit fuzzy. The LTRs are clearly identified and categorized so that they themselves don't present too much of a problem as having originated from a viral event. The 330,000 number is one anybody can substantiate by going to the primary sequence and with a recognition algorithm can pull out the LTRs. The problem is the collection of this data goes through a process of masking. This stuff is considered of no interest, or as junk to most people who are doing genomics. The actual collection of the primary data tends to be masked, so you don't even see it. So in order for you to look at this stuff and get a sense of it, you, yourself, have to go directly to the primary sequence data -- which is all this compiled, complicated stuff and apply analyses that can deal with the junk sequence. It's a conundrum just from an experimental perspective.Suzan Mazur: Is it possible to say what percentage of the human genome is virus?Luis Villarreal: Depending on how you word that -- for example, in terms of retroviruses and LTRs, the number is about 10%.Suzan Mazur: Same as the percentage of virus in a mouse.Luis Villarreal: But it's a different 10% in a mouse. It doesn't overlap that well with the human 10%. In the mouse you have significantly greater numbers of more intact endogenous retroviruses. So when you breed mice these endogenous retroviruses tend to become active and transmissible. When they first started breeding BalbC mice, within that first year the mice began to develop tumors and die in the breeding colonies. So mice are a little different than humans in that respect. Mice are colonized by viruses that are much closer to being able to make transmissible endogenous viruses. Suzan Mazur: In my conversation with Ricardo Flores, he told me that a viroid-like entity is the most likely candidate as the first replicon on Earth, rather than virus because viroids don't need protein but viruses do. He said Theodor Diener who discovered viroids first proposed the idea.  Luis Villarreal: Right.Suzan Mazur: Flores also told me that virus and viroid are not related, they have separate evolutions. From your paper, I get the sense that you don't agree. Luis Villarreal: I've had this conversation with him. Carlos Briones, a colleague of Flores, has made the more fundamental argument that it's really the stem-loop structure -- and that's related to my NYAS gangen paper -- that is the functional entity even within a viroid. If look at these stem-loop structures, you see that they're crucial and central to the identity and function of all RNA viruses. And if you look at the simplest of all RNA viruses, it's basically one sequence of these complicated, interacting stem loops.Even though I don't disagree for the most part with what Flores said about RNA viruses and viroids having distinct lineages -- it's not absolutely true because we do have an example of the hepatitis situation where you have a viroid that encodes a capsid protein that does behave like a viroid but it also behaves like a virus. So we can see examples of entities that cross those two domains.Suzan Mazur: So you do think that a viroid-like entity is the most likely candidate for the earliest replicon on Earth. But did it arise on Earth or did it come to Earth via comet? What are your thoughts?Luis Villarreal: The viroid-like entity seems more basal. What you're really talking about is an infectious, transmissible nucleic acid that doesn't necessarily encode something. But whether it arose on Earth or came via comet -- at that level I'm not sure you can conclude one way or another whether a seed of our RNA came on a comet because you do see chemistries occur on these comets -- this is something you might want to ask Vera Kolb at the University of Wisconsin -- that might be indicative of that ability to put together precursor molecules to make this consortia.Suzan Mazur: You conclude your NYAS paper by saying that the stem-loop RNA consortium became a resident of DNA, it created a stable habitat. When you say stable, you mean there is creative and destructive action going on simultaneously?Luis Villarreal: What I'm asserting is the fundamental importance of the ability of entities to persist not just to replicate. For me persistence is a big deal. The persistence of Ebola in a bat, for instance, is not an accident. It's a deep evolutionary relationship associated with the origin of bats. We often dismiss that by saying: Oh, that's just the reservoir species -- as if that relationship happens willy-nilly all the time. It's a much more fundamental event when an entity figures out how to persist and permanently figures out how to colonize its host. Suzan Mazur: You're saying the persistence has to do with toxic versus antitoxic forces.Luis Villarreal: Yes, but in the case of Ebola, for instance, it is the ability of the virus to kill. That's pretty toxic. But it doesn't kill bats, it kills other populations. That relationship is the one that creates group behavior.Suzan Mazur: But the toxic and antitoxic co-exist.Luis Villarreal: They are inseparable. Linear logic fails here. A virus itself will spit out entities that regulate themselves and are subfunctional. They're considered defective, junk by themselves. That's what we see occupying the genomes of eukaryotes -- bits and pieces of regulatory viral chunks like the LTRs. It's also the stuff that seems to be orchestrating, for example, how a placenta works.Suzan Mazur: Do we need a paradigm shift? How do you suggest moving forward in evolutionary science?Luis Villarreal: That's a much more difficult question for me now than you might expect, because it has to do with how we even think and communicate. If living systems work by these processes that are consortial and complex, then our very language and logic is a problem in terms of how we apply it to understand what's going on. I don't have a solution. In a sense our brains are entities adapted to complex thinking. When we think socially, we have this immediate gestalt reaction to a circumstance. All kinds of data are being dealt with, some of it contradictory. We end up with a sense or understanding of what we're experiencing. But in formal thinking and logic, that's not how we operate. We use -- it's a system 1 and a system 2 brain, basically.  System 1 behaves by this consortia of information and has both positive and negative, contradictory views that it uses quite comfortably. System 2 behaves linearly and logically.Suzan Mazur: It seems European scientists have accepted these ideas more than American scientists.Luis Villarreal: I agree with that. I think the consortia concept is also built socially into the Japanese culture and society, and Japanese scientists may be increasingly interested in the research.Politics is inherent in human behavior because humans have group identity that's based on cognitive input, what we believe. Information we accept. It's built into how our brains function. Negative reactions to a belief basically confront group identity that the person has.Suzan Mazur: Have you had dialogue with scientists synthesizing life in the lab?Luis Villarreal: No. But I do look at their literature and it's apparent they're excluding viruses.Suzan Mazur: Freeman Dyson spoke about parasites and origin of life in my interview with him. Luis Villarreal: I've read a lot of the earlier stuff that Freeman Dyson wrote. It seems quite congruent with how I think about things. Suzan Mazur: It's disappointing if we've got decades of compelling evidence about viruses and evolution, why it's not being responsibly considered by the scientific establishment, particularly in America.Luis Villarreal: These shifts usually take generations. How can evolutionary science not be talking about viruses when genomes are so heavily colonized by these entities? It's because scientists are human beings, and it's an inherent tendency of human cognition to defend what beliefs it has come to accept whether acquired by learning neo-Darwinian thinking or acquired by other social or cultural practices."

I wasn't interested really in evolutionary theory at a deep level. I was interested in persistence, and for this the Modern Synthesis didn't seem to be working. I just assumed that the theory didn't apply or work in the specific situations we were studying involving persistence, such as VSV, rabies and measles. But the more I got into the research, neo-Darwinism appeared to be working less and less. After I left that area of RNA virus research and began investigating SV40/polyoma virus with Paul Berg at Stanford, that's when it really struck me that a shift in evolutionary thinking was required -- because I realized that these were viruses that make their living by being persistent and stable entities that are essentially part of the host. The theory we had at the time to explain that relationship did not make any sense to me. And that's when I started on my current path.Suzan Mazur: Neo-Darwinism made no sense.Luis Villarreal: Right. In terms of selfish individual types, runaway replicators, and that whole set of related concepts.Suzan Mazur: You open your recent New York Academy of Sciences paper on viruses by saying: ""All living habitats (including prebiotic ones) have and must operate in a virosphere (a network of infectious genetic agents)"". That's pretty sweeping.  Luis Villarreal: Yes, I stick with that statement. I will argue with anybody on that point.I'd like to define what I mean by a virus, which is a molecular parasite dependent on its host for its maintenance and replication. A virus can also infect another virus, which then becomes its host. Fundamentally, this definition is symbiotic because it has embedded in it dependence on others.Suzan Mazur: You've also noted that ""most experimental paradigms seek to eliminate or have ignored viruses"" and you've advocated that evolutionary science now ""adopt a virus-first perspective.""I want to focus on the science in our interview, but obviously, politics comes into play here. Would you talk about that?Luis Villarreal: Absolutely. That whole issue of politics--Suzan Mazur: What kind of resistance do you see among evolutionary scientists to accepting a virus-first perspective? Luis Villarreal: There are actually relatively few formally-trained evolutionary scientists who will accept the virus-first perspective. I've encountered a couple. I'm immersed in a population of traditional evolutionary biologists here at Irvine. They just dismiss it. They don't even want to think about it. So it's not a prevailing perspective. But it's one that I think much better explains the foundations of observations, especially now that we have metagenomics informing us about the character of genetic entities -- how lineages and genomes change.Suzan Mazur: Scientists don't want to take the time to study it?Luis Villarreal: It's some of that. They very much believe in their theory, and the theory comes first and the observations come second. This is an issue with Manfred Eigen, for example. Eigen has developed a nice theory and career based on this approach. When this happens the science becomes not very available or open to experimental correction. Of course, if it weren't for Manfred Eigen perhaps we wouldn't have pursued the path of viruses the way we did. But Eigen's book published last year, which covers the history of quasispecies thinking, etc., with in-depth mathematical model and evaluations, is completely missing references to a generation and a half of experimental results virologists have accumulated -- many of which are not really terribly consistent with what Eigen is arguing.  Esteban Domingo and colleagues in Spain have written a really fantastic review of the last 20 years of virus experimentation. But Eigen doesn't refer to any of it in his book. It's what can happen when a scientist believes their own theory too much.Suzan Mazur: It should be evidence first.Luis Villarreal: Which is the perspective that I adopt.Suzan Mazur: While we're on the subject of politics, I follow you all the way to the end of your New York Academy of Sciences paper ""Force for ancient and recent life: viral and stem-loop RNA consortia promote life"" -- which you call your ""gangen"" paper because of your perspective of viruses as consortia -- until I get to the concluding paragraphs where you make reference to the work of Nilesh Vaidya and Niles Lehman. I interviewed Vaidya at Princeton two years ago about his work on ""recombination events to produce autocatalytic sets,"" as he described it to me, and I ran that interview online. Vaidya has since his 2012 Nature paper on that subject with Niles Lehman redirected his research interests. It is unclear why.Luis Villarreal: I can't actually answer that, but I have suspicions, and they're social in nature. When you make an experimental inference that confronts fundamentally these well-entrenched views - it makes a career very difficult. I got to a position in my career where I was able to extricate myself from a lot of those consequences. Somebody just starting out would be hammered and out of business.   Suzan Mazur: Lehman's work had been supported by the late Harry Lonsdale for several years. Lonsdale's reviewers cited lack of results in 2014, one noting: ""[E]ven if apparently recombined sequences are detected, it will be difficult or impossible to trace their genesis.""And regarding your mention of a so-called ""autocatalytic ribozyme"" in your NYAS paper with reference to Lehman's research - Nobelist Jack Szostak has told me this about autocatalytic sets: ""Autocatalytic sets is one of those concepts where the people who came up with the original idea, like Stuart Kauffman, rather than admit being wrong kept changing their story until it was basically the same concept everybody was already working on.Luis Villarreal: I've had some conversations with chemists along these lines, which gets into a distinct domain of thinking. They drift into more complicated catalytic outcomes where you just don't have a linear relationship of A to B to C. A to B to C is typically how chemistry is taught. To deny the existence of the nonlinear is not an effective way of thinking about things.Suzan Mazur: Vaidya references Kauffman's concept.Luis Villarreal: That may be, but my point is more fundamental. In order to create a system that has participants that interact and can form an identity as a group, it has to have these characteristics I've described or outlined in the paper that you and I have been discussing, the NYAS ""gangen paper,"" which is consistent with a lot of these attempts to get catalytic RNA to function in a population.  Suzan Mazur: So you're saying more traditionally-trained chemists just don't get it, they want to see the molecules.Luis Villarreal. Yes, I would say that. In fact, you might want to talk to Vera Kolb at the University of Wisconsin. She's a professor of organic chemist and is interested in origin of life issues and has been active in astrobiology. Vera was trained along traditional lines but thinks in more complex ways with respect to how origin of life occurred.  Suzan Mazur:  Nick Hud, a Georgia Tech chemist who is trying to find the simplest molecules needed to start life -- a precursor to RNA -- says he's got ""a molecular assembly that is perhaps one bond away from making it a polymer - a covalent polymer."" Hud told me, ""[There is a long history of people proposing autocatalytic cycles and thinking that such cycles are central to starting life, but then not getting much to work in the lab.""Luis Villarreal: It' a difficult transition to the nonlinear because it's not how we traditionally do these kind of experiments.  The cooperative stem-loop RNA business has had some successes experimentally. Some of those observations I incorporated in the NYAS paper.Suzan Mazur: Corrado Spadafora, who's found evidence of a germline crossing of the Weismann barrier in his experiments, now questions whether a Weismann barrier even exists. He supports your thinking, telling me this:""([E]ndogenous) retroviruses have contributed to shape our genome, are constitutive components of it and are currently playing crucial roles in fundamental processes such as embryogenesis, tumorigenesis and, in the long run, evolution."" And František Baluška at the University of Bonn's Institute of Cellular & Molecular Botany has noted: ""Infection, especially the viral one, but also bacterial and fungal infections, followed by symbiosis, is proposed to act as the major force that drives biological evolution toward higher complexity.""  Baluška told me viruses ""manipulate adjacent cells to form cell-cell adhesions.""Animal biologists bristle at the idea of cell-cell adhesion linked to viral infection and viruses, one animal biologist cynically describing them to me as ""intelligent viruses.""Luis Villarreal: When people use terms like ""intelligent viruses"" -- it is one thing to have a competence, code competence, communication competence that viruses essentially must have in order to function, but if that transitions into a concept of intelligence, that becomes problematic for me. Suzan Mazur: Do viruses have an effect at only the microscale or is their effect apparent at the mesoscale and even macroscale?Luis Villarreal: Well, what is the effect of the Ebola outbreak on the human culture and human condition? Ebola is a specific example to think about because the bats have acquired a very unlikely bit of information from Ebola itself, and they did so with the help of another virus, probably an endogenous retrovirus, because it turned that RNA into a DNA and deposited it into the chromosome -- which is what had to have happened. It's not something that a virus can do by itself. It has to have cooperated in a rather complicated way. But my point is that as a consequence, the adaptions that must occur are at all these different levels -- in the context of the immune system, in the context of the culture, in the context of the behavior -- all of this is affected by these events.  Suzan Mazur: But in terms of form. Spadafora mentions embryogenesis and you make some reference in a previous paper to the embryo.Luis Villarreal: The systems biologists have immersed themselves in this issue quite a bit because they are characterizing all the transcripts that have occurred in the early stages of development -- 1, 2 cell stages. If you just look at the math, at the amount that is being expressed or transcribed without consigning meaning to it, you see that on a very large scale these parasitic sequences, these endogenous viruses, virons and all of these retroposons are very highly expressed at these points of development and commitment. Some of these are entities that were acquired in a lineage specific way so that you see them in primates or you see them in chimps or you see them in humans. You don't see them necessarily in sister species. So it's clear that some editing events mediated by infectious agents have occurred at the very earliest stages of commitment and differentiation. They are occurring on a significant scale. These are not minor numbers. They're quite abundant.Suzan Mazur: So it affects morphology.Luis Villareal: Absolutely, yes. But in ways we are just beginning to tease apart. We don't really understand how, for example, the large mass of non-coding RNAs is doing what it's doing.  Suzan Mazur: If your gangen hypothesis is correct, which is that gangs, i.e., ""RNA collective ensembles coupled with the emergence of endonuclease, ligase, cooperative catalysis, group identity and history markers (RNA) are needed for life to emerge"" -- what happens to the current thinking?Luis Villarreal: It means that sphere of logic is not sufficient to understand this collective. Because if you think about how the collective must operate, in fact, it becomes even a problem of language.  You can always trace a linear link between any two participants or any three or four or five participants in a collective. But if it has a conditional character to it. . . If you think of alu retroposon RNA in the human brain and it has a particular activity or function and a particular neuron, and it's doing a specific activity of connecting to some other cell, but then you see in another state, say during learning and memory where it is doing something different and can actually oppose the activity that you saw in the first state -- this means an individual entity has multiple activities. And that's the character of a consortia, which means you now have to start thinking in terms of how the population works and not by just these linear nodes that represent the end reactions. Because they have a conditionality associated with them.Suzan Mazur: You've noted that during evolution 3.3 gigabases of DNA, which is the current size of our genome, was once retrovirus, that there are about 330,000 solo long terminal repeats of retroviruses now in human DNA. You've also said these long terminal repeats (LTRs) ""contributed to reregulating about 1,500 genes needed for the placenta to emerge."" In terms of percentages how much of today's human genome is virus and how are you able to measure this?Luis Villarreal: The definition of what is virus is a little bit fuzzy. The LTRs are clearly identified and categorized so that they themselves don't present too much of a problem as having originated from a viral event. The 330,000 number is one anybody can substantiate by going to the primary sequence and with a recognition algorithm can pull out the LTRs. The problem is the collection of this data goes through a process of masking. This stuff is considered of no interest, or as junk to most people who are doing genomics. The actual collection of the primary data tends to be masked, so you don't even see it. So in order for you to look at this stuff and get a sense of it, you, yourself, have to go directly to the primary sequence data -- which is all this compiled, complicated stuff and apply analyses that can deal with the junk sequence. It's a conundrum just from an experimental perspective.Suzan Mazur: Is it possible to say what percentage of the human genome is virus?Luis Villarreal: Depending on how you word that -- for example, in terms of retroviruses and LTRs, the number is about 10%.Suzan Mazur: Same as the percentage of virus in a mouse.Luis Villarreal: But it's a different 10% in a mouse. It doesn't overlap that well with the human 10%. In the mouse you have significantly greater numbers of more intact endogenous retroviruses. So when you breed mice these endogenous retroviruses tend to become active and transmissible. When they first started breeding BalbC mice, within that first year the mice began to develop tumors and die in the breeding colonies. So mice are a little different than humans in that respect. Mice are colonized by viruses that are much closer to being able to make transmissible endogenous viruses. Suzan Mazur: In my conversation with Ricardo Flores, he told me that a viroid-like entity is the most likely candidate as the first replicon on Earth, rather than virus because viroids don't need protein but viruses do. He said Theodor Diener who discovered viroids first proposed the idea.  Luis Villarreal: Right.Suzan Mazur: Flores also told me that virus and viroid are not related, they have separate evolutions. From your paper, I get the sense that you don't agree. Luis Villarreal: I've had this conversation with him. Carlos Briones, a colleague of Flores, has made the more fundamental argument that it's really the stem-loop structure -- and that's related to my NYAS gangen paper -- that is the functional entity even within a viroid. If look at these stem-loop structures, you see that they're crucial and central to the identity and function of all RNA viruses. And if you look at the simplest of all RNA viruses, it's basically one sequence of these complicated, interacting stem loops.Even though I don't disagree for the most part with what Flores said about RNA viruses and viroids having distinct lineages -- it's not absolutely true because we do have an example of the hepatitis situation where you have a viroid that encodes a capsid protein that does behave like a viroid but it also behaves like a virus. So we can see examples of entities that cross those two domains.Suzan Mazur: So you do think that a viroid-like entity is the most likely candidate for the earliest replicon on Earth. But did it arise on Earth or did it come to Earth via comet? What are your thoughts?Luis Villarreal: The viroid-like entity seems more basal. What you're really talking about is an infectious, transmissible nucleic acid that doesn't necessarily encode something. But whether it arose on Earth or came via comet -- at that level I'm not sure you can conclude one way or another whether a seed of our RNA came on a comet because you do see chemistries occur on these comets -- this is something you might want to ask Vera Kolb at the University of Wisconsin -- that might be indicative of that ability to put together precursor molecules to make this consortia.Suzan Mazur: You conclude your NYAS paper by saying that the stem-loop RNA consortium became a resident of DNA, it created a stable habitat. When you say stable, you mean there is creative and destructive action going on simultaneously?Luis Villarreal: What I'm asserting is the fundamental importance of the ability of entities to persist not just to replicate. For me persistence is a big deal. The persistence of Ebola in a bat, for instance, is not an accident. It's a deep evolutionary relationship associated with the origin of bats. We often dismiss that by saying: Oh, that's just the reservoir species -- as if that relationship happens willy-nilly all the time. It's a much more fundamental event when an entity figures out how to persist and permanently figures out how to colonize its host. Suzan Mazur: You're saying the persistence has to do with toxic versus antitoxic forces.Luis Villarreal: Yes, but in the case of Ebola, for instance, it is the ability of the virus to kill. That's pretty toxic. But it doesn't kill bats, it kills other populations. That relationship is the one that creates group behavior.Suzan Mazur: But the toxic and antitoxic co-exist.Luis Villarreal: They are inseparable. Linear logic fails here. A virus itself will spit out entities that regulate themselves and are subfunctional. They're considered defective, junk by themselves. That's what we see occupying the genomes of eukaryotes -- bits and pieces of regulatory viral chunks like the LTRs. It's also the stuff that seems to be orchestrating, for example, how a placenta works.Suzan Mazur: Do we need a paradigm shift? How do you suggest moving forward in evolutionary science?Luis Villarreal: That's a much more difficult question for me now than you might expect, because it has to do with how we even think and communicate. If living systems work by these processes that are consortial and complex, then our very language and logic is a problem in terms of how we apply it to understand what's going on. I don't have a solution. In a sense our brains are entities adapted to complex thinking. When we think socially, we have this immediate gestalt reaction to a circumstance. All kinds of data are being dealt with, some of it contradictory. We end up with a sense or understanding of what we're experiencing. But in formal thinking and logic, that's not how we operate. We use -- it's a system 1 and a system 2 brain, basically.  System 1 behaves by this consortia of information and has both positive and negative, contradictory views that it uses quite comfortably. System 2 behaves linearly and logically.Suzan Mazur: It seems European scientists have accepted these ideas more than American scientists.Luis Villarreal: I agree with that. I think the consortia concept is also built socially into the Japanese culture and society, and Japanese scientists may be increasingly interested in the research.Politics is inherent in human behavior because humans have group identity that's based on cognitive input, what we believe. Information we accept. It's built into how our brains function. Negative reactions to a belief basically confront group identity that the person has.Suzan Mazur: Have you had dialogue with scientists synthesizing life in the lab?Luis Villarreal: No. But I do look at their literature and it's apparent they're excluding viruses.Suzan Mazur: Freeman Dyson spoke about parasites and origin of life in my interview with him. Luis Villarreal: I've read a lot of the earlier stuff that Freeman Dyson wrote. It seems quite congruent with how I think about things. Suzan Mazur: It's disappointing if we've got decades of compelling evidence about viruses and evolution, why it's not being responsibly considered by the scientific establishment, particularly in America.Luis Villarreal: These shifts usually take generations. How can evolutionary science not be talking about viruses when genomes are so heavily colonized by these entities? It's because scientists are human beings, and it's an inherent tendency of human cognition to defend what beliefs it has come to accept whether acquired by learning neo-Darwinian thinking or acquired by other social or cultural practices."
27,EDUCATION,Is Your Child's Creativity Going Unnoticed?,"Mark HT Ridinger, MD, ContributorPhysician, polymath, innovator and provocateur-in-residence at...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-your-childs-creativity_b_6878112.html,"Intelligence is of course an important part of the equation but what of creativity, of identifying and measuring divergent thinking, and fostering its development?",2015-03-17,2015-03-16-1426517939-8276365-Depositphotos_18471121_xs.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-16-1426517939-8276365-Depositphotos_18471121_xs-thumb.jpg,"  Deposit Photos. Used with permission.When discussing the state of education in America, most talk today revolves around measuring intelligence and trying to improve standardized test performance. IQ tests (which attempt to measure convergent thinking) are frequently used to try and find our brightest students and to place them in gifted programs. Intelligence is of course an important part of the equation but what of creativity, of identifying and measuring divergent thinking, and fostering its development? What of Creativity Intelligence (CQ)? Our future problem solvers and innovators, be they entrepreneurs, inventors, authors or researchers will rely on creative intelligence, and identifying and fostering them early in their education is paramount for America's future. Unfortunately we are failing at that endeavor.The paradigm of merely equating IQ with the skills needed for success is outdated. Current research shows that there is little correlation between intelligence and creativity, except at lower ends of the IQ scale. People can in fact be both highly intelligent and creative, but also intelligent and uncreative, and vice versa. But how do we identify CQ? Dr. E. Paul Torrance has been called the Father of Creativity, for his work that began in the 1960's. His standardized test, the Torrance Test for Creative Thinking (TTCT) is considered to be the gold standard for measuring and assessing creative thinking, and can be administered at any educational level -- from kindergarten through graduate work.Several recent comprehensive reviews of Torrance's data -- spanning decades -- have been published. The bottom-line is the TTCT is a strong predictor of future lifetime creative accomplishments. In fact, Indiana University's Jonathon Plucker determined that the correlation to lifetime creative accomplishment (e.g. inventions, patents, publications etc.) was more than three times stronger for childhood creativity (as measured by the TTCT) than childhood IQ. Having a validated instrument like the TTCT is so important because alternative means to identify CQ don't work so well. Expert opinion and teacher nominations have been used, but these methods are prone to errors and biases. For example, students who are already achieving or who have pleasant demeanors or have already ranked well on conventional IQ tests tend to be selected, while researchers have shown that highly creative students and divergent thinkers are typically shunned and are at risk of becoming estranged from teachers and other students. In fact, the odds of dropping out increases by as much as 50 percent if creative students are in the wrong school environment.What else has the review of Torrance's data shown? Unfortunately, that America seems to be in a CQ crisis. Kyung-Hee Kim, an assistant professor at William and Mary, analyzed 300,000 TTCT results and the data suggests that creativity has been on the decline in the US since 1990. The age group that is showing the worst decline is the kindergarten to sixth grade. The factors behind this decline aren't known, but may be due to a mix of uncreative play (escalating hours spent in front of the TV or video game console for example), changing parenting and family dynamics (research suggests a stable home environment that also values uniqueness is important) and an educational system that focuses too much on rote memorization, standardized curriculum and national standardize testing. Are we stifling divergent thinking in our children for conformity of behavior?The rest of the world seems to have woken up to the need to foster creativity in the educational process, and initiatives to make the development of creative thinking a national priority are on going in England, the EU and even China. The United States needs a similar national initiative if we hope to stay competitive on the world stage. What is needed is a new approach to learning that still has children mastering necessary skills and knowledge, but through a creative pedagogical approach. We know that creativity can be measured, managed and fostered; there is no excuse to not implement such a strategy in our school system. Let's see the creation and deployment of creative exercise classes for our students and the use of creativity tests as additional inclusion criteria to gifted programs. Surely ""CE"" is at least every bit as important as PE.Mark HT Ridinger, MD  www.EvolvedGeneralist.com "

For beyond the architecture of a grand hallway, the panorama from one's terrace, the rich fabrics of the draperies, and the superb food and wine, there are so many unnoticed details that en masse enhance all the rest, from the replacement of flowers in every vase to the condition of every carpet, from the way tables are set and the services performed as if by silent magic.  To take in every one of the details at Grand Hotel Tremezzo on the western shore of Italy's glorious Lake Como would take weeks and weeks at your leisure, so let me tell you of some of the unique wonders of this exquisite place, which Greta Garbo's character in the 1932 film Grand Hotel referred to as ""that happy, sunny place."" (Her preferred room, now Number 113, is named in her honor.) The hotel dates to 1910 at a time when Europe's leisure class went on their grand tours for months at places like the Villa D'Este and Serbelloni, but Enea and Maris Gandola wanted something smaller, more secluded and more intimate for guests, who, after World War I, increasingly came to the area for health and sport. In the 1930s ownership passed to the Sampietro family, who managed to keep it open during World War II, and the post-war growth of international tourism, not least American, made Tremezzo famous as a place of unpretentious luxury and Italian savoir-faire. The local De Santis family then bought the hotel, and last year a granddaughter, the ebullient and very sophisticated Valentina De Santis, was appointed CEO to work on those ten thousand details and bring a more youthful cachet to the property. There is now a state-of-the-art spa and three swimming pools. The rooms, each different, all with a view of the lake, have LCD flat screen satellite TV, free Wi-Fi, Aquae di Como toiletries, and very large bathrooms; mine had a marble, six-foot wide double sink in the center of the room, whose wide window looked out over the water. She is even experimenting with bed sheets created from processed wood that have the softness and luxurious feel of linens with the highest of thread counts. One hundred service professionals keep all such details impeccable. One can drive from Milan to Grand Tremezzo in an hour, but I prefer to arrive by water. A fast train to Como then a smooth boat ride reveals all the majesty of Italy's lake region, past little towns and old villas (including the rather modest one George Clooney and his new bride, Amal, own). Arriving at Grand Tremezzo, my bags were taken as I ascended an elevator that opens onto the gorgeous art nouveau-style lobby done (above) in vibrant colors of fuchsia and ocher, with walls covered in silk. This is not an atrium to dazzle you but to make you feel warmly welcome. A butler/concierge is located on every floor.  My room (above) was done in velvety, dovelike shades of gray and gray-green, accented in gold, with a terrace where it is possible to block out the whole world except the mountains and flow of Lake Como lighted by the soft Lombardian sun.  The extravagant breakfast buffet in the Regina Room, with its own broad terrace, is rich in everything from Italian cheeses and charcuterie to a variety of breads, croissants and jams, with eggs cooked to order and coffee brewed as only Italians know how. By the time you come down for breakfast, an array of international daily newspapers will have been displayed in a library with a remarkable collection of books on gardening. In fact, the hotel itself is set adjacent to the Villa Carlotta, now an art museum with a four-acre park.  I shall leave for another article the attractions of the Lake Como area, crisscrossed by ferries, and stay focused on reasons for staying put at Tremezzo, which includes a splendid 19th century, scarlet-colored billiards table. A floodlighted clay tennis court overlooks the lake, Seven golf courses are nearby, and bicycling along the flat shoreline is a capital way to see the area. Just strolling or sitting among the azaleas and bougainvillea should bring down one's blood pressure by ten percent. There are three restaurants at Tremezzo, all of which serve the hotel's signature cocoa-and-almond cake named Torta Valentina. All the food service is overseen by Chef Osvaldo Presazzi, here since 1992, after stints at illustrious restaurants like Les Ambassadeurs at the Hotel Crillon in Paris, Il Teatro in Milan, and the restaurants of master chef Gualtiero Marchesi in Erbusco and Milan. Indeed, for 2015, Signore Marchesi will be involved in the development of menus for Tremezzo's restaurants, which will include his famous dish of risotto with edible gold foil (below). The fine dining room is called La Terrazza (below), with an extensive menu of local and regional dishes drawing as much as possible on the provender and larder of the lake country and Lombardy. Thus, I feasted on dishes like scallops with a sauce of lettuce (€32); foie gras terrine graced with true balsamico tradizionale (€32); ring-shaped pasta called anelli made into savory pancakes filled with ricotta and spinach (€22); a luscious lobster and macaroni (€48); roasted young local rooster with potatoes and spring onions (€26); most of the fish come right from the lakes. Desserts far exceed what is usual in Italian restaurants, and the menu is accompanied by an array of fine regional wines. Sit there at twilight as the staff lights the table candles, sip a negroni or glass of Lombardian sparkling wine from Franciacorta, and you may not get up from the table till the moon finishes its rise in the night sky.  L'Escale (below) is a casual, subterranean fondue and wine bar that also offers a wide array of charcuterie and cheeses, as well as meats and shellfish that you cook at your own table. The raclette (€22), made with Swiss cheese from the Valais, is melted on a hot stone and eaten with gherkins, while the fondue (€32-36) involves dipping skewers of bread, fruit and meats into either melted cheese or boiling oil. With red wine from the Valtellina, this is a delightful evening. For snacks and pizzas there is the TBar, and every Monday night they hold a candlelit poolside pizza party that is extremely popular.  Staying put in Grand Tremezzo, with walks along the lake, a visit to Palazzo Carlotta, and a sojourn down to the town of Como can easily take up one's weekend. But the ferries that crisscross the lake make exploring the area easy and the sights are eye-opening--these I shall be writing about in a future article.  You could, however, hardly be blamed for not ever leaving the property of Grand Tremezzo for days, for it is tempting to practice what Italians call ""dolce far niente""--the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an art well worth learning in a place so sincerely dedicated to that proposition.Grand Hotel Tremezzo is located at Via Provinciale Regina, 8, Tremezzina.  Phone:+39 0344 42491"

(Her preferred room, now Number 113, is named in her honor.) The hotel dates to 1910 at a time when Europe's leisure class went on their grand tours for months at places like the Villa D'Este and Serbelloni, but Enea and Maris Gandola wanted something smaller, more secluded and more intimate for guests, who, after World War I, increasingly came to the area for health and sport. In the 1930s ownership passed to the Sampietro family, who managed to keep it open during World War II, and the post-war growth of international tourism, not least American, made Tremezzo famous as a place of unpretentious luxury and Italian savoir-faire. The local De Santis family then bought the hotel, and last year a granddaughter, the ebullient and very sophisticated Valentina De Santis, was appointed CEO to work on those ten thousand details and bring a more youthful cachet to the property. There is now a state-of-the-art spa and three swimming pools. The rooms, each different, all with a view of the lake, have LCD flat screen satellite TV, free Wi-Fi, Aquae di Como toiletries, and very large bathrooms; mine had a marble, six-foot wide double sink in the center of the room, whose wide window looked out over the water. She is even experimenting with bed sheets created from processed wood that have the softness and luxurious feel of linens with the highest of thread counts. One hundred service professionals keep all such details impeccable. One can drive from Milan to Grand Tremezzo in an hour, but I prefer to arrive by water. A fast train to Como then a smooth boat ride reveals all the majesty of Italy's lake region, past little towns and old villas (including the rather modest one George Clooney and his new bride, Amal, own). Arriving at Grand Tremezzo, my bags were taken as I ascended an elevator that opens onto the gorgeous art nouveau-style lobby done (above) in vibrant colors of fuchsia and ocher, with walls covered in silk. This is not an atrium to dazzle you but to make you feel warmly welcome. A butler/concierge is located on every floor.  My room (above) was done in velvety, dovelike shades of gray and gray-green, accented in gold, with a terrace where it is possible to block out the whole world except the mountains and flow of Lake Como lighted by the soft Lombardian sun.  The extravagant breakfast buffet in the Regina Room, with its own broad terrace, is rich in everything from Italian cheeses and charcuterie to a variety of breads, croissants and jams, with eggs cooked to order and coffee brewed as only Italians know how. By the time you come down for breakfast, an array of international daily newspapers will have been displayed in a library with a remarkable collection of books on gardening. In fact, the hotel itself is set adjacent to the Villa Carlotta, now an art museum with a four-acre park.  I shall leave for another article the attractions of the Lake Como area, crisscrossed by ferries, and stay focused on reasons for staying put at Tremezzo, which includes a splendid 19th century, scarlet-colored billiards table. A floodlighted clay tennis court overlooks the lake, Seven golf courses are nearby, and bicycling along the flat shoreline is a capital way to see the area. Just strolling or sitting among the azaleas and bougainvillea should bring down one's blood pressure by ten percent. There are three restaurants at Tremezzo, all of which serve the hotel's signature cocoa-and-almond cake named Torta Valentina. All the food service is overseen by Chef Osvaldo Presazzi, here since 1992, after stints at illustrious restaurants like Les Ambassadeurs at the Hotel Crillon in Paris, Il Teatro in Milan, and the restaurants of master chef Gualtiero Marchesi in Erbusco and Milan. Indeed, for 2015, Signore Marchesi will be involved in the development of menus for Tremezzo's restaurants, which will include his famous dish of risotto with edible gold foil (below). The fine dining room is called La Terrazza (below), with an extensive menu of local and regional dishes drawing as much as possible on the provender and larder of the lake country and Lombardy. Thus, I feasted on dishes like scallops with a sauce of lettuce (€32); foie gras terrine graced with true balsamico tradizionale (€32); ring-shaped pasta called anelli made into savory pancakes filled with ricotta and spinach (€22); a luscious lobster and macaroni (€48); roasted young local rooster with potatoes and spring onions (€26); most of the fish come right from the lakes. Desserts far exceed what is usual in Italian restaurants, and the menu is accompanied by an array of fine regional wines. Sit there at twilight as the staff lights the table candles, sip a negroni or glass of Lombardian sparkling wine from Franciacorta, and you may not get up from the table till the moon finishes its rise in the night sky.  L'Escale (below) is a casual, subterranean fondue and wine bar that also offers a wide array of charcuterie and cheeses, as well as meats and shellfish that you cook at your own table. The raclette (€22), made with Swiss cheese from the Valais, is melted on a hot stone and eaten with gherkins, while the fondue (€32-36) involves dipping skewers of bread, fruit and meats into either melted cheese or boiling oil. With red wine from the Valtellina, this is a delightful evening. For snacks and pizzas there is the TBar, and every Monday night they hold a candlelit poolside pizza party that is extremely popular.  Staying put in Grand Tremezzo, with walks along the lake, a visit to Palazzo Carlotta, and a sojourn down to the town of Como can easily take up one's weekend. But the ferries that crisscross the lake make exploring the area easy and the sights are eye-opening--these I shall be writing about in a future article.  You could, however, hardly be blamed for not ever leaving the property of Grand Tremezzo for days, for it is tempting to practice what Italians call ""dolce far niente""--the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an art well worth learning in a place so sincerely dedicated to that proposition.Grand Hotel Tremezzo is located at Via Provinciale Regina, 8, Tremezzina.  Phone:+39 0344 42491"

31,IMPACT,More Hospitals Are Accepting Breast Milk Donations For Babies Who Aren't Getting Enough,Robbie Couch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donated-breast-milk-nyc_n_6878322.html,,2015-03-17,small premature baby lies in an incubator a grown hand reaches in grasping the foot in caring manner,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d67f2000009900ffc493.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One Massachusetts nonprofit is helping hospitalized babies reap the benefits of consuming breast milk. And its services are in high demand. Mothers Milk Bank Northeast (MMBNE) screens and pasteurizes milk donated from women, and works with hospitals to ensure premature babies and other infants in need in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) have access to it.More and more hospitals throughout the East Coast are working with the group to establish partnerships that allow preemies and babies in need to obtain donated milk, Naomi Bar-Yam, the nonprofit's executive director, told The Huffington Post. According to Bar-Yam, there are numerous reasons why it may be more difficult for mothers of babies in the NICU to breastfeed, which makes the nonprofit's services all the more important. If a baby is born early, for example, the mother's body may not be prepared to produce milk, she said. Stress can also hinder a woman's milk supply, and ""having a baby two or three months early and in the NICU is, by definition, stressful.""She said that although there's been a decline in premature births nationally, more medical centers are using donor milk because it's becoming increasingly clear that the nutrition source helps preemies survive and thrive. NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, for instance, is aiming to offer donated mothers' milk to preemies by the end of March, New York Daily News reported.“We know that there are benefits for the low-birth-weight baby,” Dr. Martha Caprio, who runs the hospital’s NICU, told the outlet. “Maternal milk does improve outcomes.” Breast milk helps lower babies' risk of developing a variety of different conditions, according to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Health, including childhood leukemia, type 2 diabetes, asthma and lower respiratory infections. Breastfeeding can be especially beneficial for preemies, advocacy group Breastmilk Counts notes, as they are at higher risk for experiencing health complications. In 2012 in the U.S., about 450,000 babies -- roughly one out of every nine infants -- were born prematurely, that is before 37 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The NY Daily News reported that, women donate milk to MMBNE for a variety of reasons -- some mothers may have excess milk stored and wish to give away what's not needed, while others may have lost a child after freezing milk in advance. But getting those donations into more hospitals can be a lengthy process, according to Bar-Yam. She told HuffPost that while MMBNE currently works with about 50 medical centers throughout the East Coast, the group is in talks with about 30 more that are hoping to establish a NICU donor milk program. There are several steps those 30 centers must go through in order to give donor milk to patients. Theresa McCaffrey -- whose daughter was born four months early last summer -- wasn't able to get her baby donated milk because the hospital at which her child was receiving care didn't have a tissue bank license that included breast milk, NY Daily News reported. After transferring hospitals, McCaffrey was able to get a prescription for donated milk, but had to purchase it directly from the milk bank and bring it to the hospital on her own.If things go according to plan, however, more and more moms will be in luck in the coming months, as more hospitals establish new protocol regarding donated milk.“When I first started doing this a few years ago, there was kind of the ‘Ew, yuck’ factor,” Bar-Yam told the N.Y. Daily News. “We are moving past that, at least in the medical community.” Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter"
