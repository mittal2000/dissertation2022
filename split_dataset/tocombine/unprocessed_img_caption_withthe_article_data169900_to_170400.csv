0,PARENTING,Occupy Christmas: Gifts That Give Back,"Kristen Howerton, Contributor
Blogger, Rage Against the Minivan",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/occupy-christmas_us_5b9c8ec7e4b03a1dcc7fca6e,"In a season marked by giving, I love the idea of giving back to our community and our planet.",2012-12-06,"31 Bits Jewelryis made out of 100% recycled paper, posters, and magazines by internally displaced women in Northern Uganda. Each piece of jewelry is unique and hand-crafted by a woman in the community of Gulu, Uganda. ",https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-11-27-31bits.jpg,"I'm pushing for another ""Occupy Christmas"" movement this year. Last year, a lot of people seemed enthused about the idea of bringing the consumerism down a notch for the holidays and bringing the tangible giving up for those in need. Less plastic toys for privileged kids, more food on the table for those without... that kind of thing. In a season marked by giving, I love the idea of giving back to our community and our planet. There are many companies focused on helping others as a part of their business plan, so the purchase of a holiday gift can also help someone in need. Here are some great ways you can do your Christmas shopping and give back at the same time.Pure Charity is an easy way to make all holiday (and general) purchases work for good. You can register with them to earn money back on everyday purchases at places like Target, Best Buy and Shutterfly. That money gets put into a charitable giving account that you can then disperse to your favorite causes. Like a boss.There are also a number of products you can buy that give back. I know a lot of people are familiar with the Tom's shoe model: You buy something, then they give something to someone in need. While this is a nice idea, it doesn't really create a lasting effect for the recipient of a one-time gift. So I've attempted to research companies that are ""teaching a man to fish"" instead of simply giving a handout. These are companies that create jobs and that empower people to rise out of poverty, whether it be woman making necklaces in Uganda or a sewing school for former prostitutes in India. I've researched these organizations and feel like they represent some of the best in terms of micro-enterprise or sustainable assistance: 31 Bits In addition to being cute and fashion-forward, 31 Bits Jewelry is made out of 100% recycled paper, posters, and magazines by internally displaced women in Northern Uganda. Each piece of jewelry is unique and hand-crafted by a woman in the community of Gulu, Uganda. Punjammies Punjammies are sari-inspired pajamas. Each pair of Punjammies are created in an after-care facility for women who have been rescued, released or escaped from a life of forced prostitution. Holistic aftercare involves quality medical care, emotional safety, education and the tools to create a new way of life for herself. Haitian Creations Haitian Creations is a program of Heartline Ministries. The bags and jewelry from Haitian Creations are handmade by women in Haiti who are a part of a sewing program that is giving these impoverished women lifelong skills. The ability to earn money gives these women the ability to be self-sufficient, to support their families and to have the independence they need in a society where this is often difficult. Each artist's name is on a tag in the purse that she made. Soon, you will be able to look up the artist of your purse on the website and see her picture and story. Krochet Kids I am so in love with Krochet Kids. Not just because their hats are perfect for hiding my unwashed hair at school drop-off. And not just because my friend Sarah and her husband Blake are pioneering their program in Peru. What I love about Krochet Kids is that it's a company that is empowering impoverished people to earn an income for themselves. Krochet Kids offers 3-year programs to women living in poverty. In this program, the women learn to crochet hats to earn an income and be able to fully support themselves for the first time in their lives. Based in Uganda and Peru, the hats are sold in the U.S., on their website and at most Nordstroms. Give Prints Give Prints is a for-profit company working to give financially to various non profits (501c). Just as one values the beauty of a print, Give Prints values the beauty of lives changed and gives 50% of their profits to help love people around the world. The heart of Give Prints is to help people send love to others through the purchasing of photo prints. It was born out of a photographer's desire to help fellow photographers publicize their work while helping worthy organizations that are already reaching out to people all over the world. The photographers showcased on the site gave their talents to give to their charities. Ever/After Clothing Ever/After Clothing is a casual lifestyle clothing brand for kids and adults. They've paired simple, modern design with super-soft premium fabrics. My kids love their t-shirts and cozy leggings and yoga pants. Best of all, the company will donate 25% of the net profit from each garment you buy to the cause of your choice. Every garment comes with a change the story card that holds the value of this donation. They can then enter the code online, and see how they are helping to change the story.  Compassion A gift from Compassion International helps provide clean drinking water, medical treatment, disaster relief, food supplies and much more for Compassion-assisted children and their families. Once you purchase a gift, you will have the opportunity to choose from a variety of complimentary greeting cards to send to your honorees. For a last-minute gift option, you can print a card at home or send via email. Macy's Heart of Haiti The Heart of Haiti line at Macys allows artisans in Haiti to produce beautiful handcrafts that are then sold in department stores throughout the US. Partnered with Fairwinds Trading and BrandAid, artisans receive half the wholesale price of every item in the collection. Leakey Collection The Leakey Collection was founded in 2002 by Katy and Philip Leakey. Their work includes the design and manufacture of contemporary jewelry that is hand made by the Maasai women and men of Kenya from environmentally sustainable materials. The flagship item of the collection Zulugrass. Zulugrass is lightweight, durable and versatile. Depending on the color and amount of strands worn the look can be as subdued or as colorful you want. The Leakey Collection is available in over 1200 stores nationwide or online. Not for Sale The Not for Sale store generates enterprise & employment to prevent human trafficking and create new futures for survivors. Every purchase you make is an action to end slavery -- because no one should be for sale. Journals, bags and scarves that give freedom.  Collaborative World Brand Collaborative World Brand is a for-profit apparel company that exists to support the non-profit organization. They call it a ""Co-Profit"". Collaborative World Brand donates 50% of their overall profit from the sale of clothing to partners already doing good in the world. Their mission is to actively pursue new and more extraordinary ways to give, while encouraging others to do the same. Rescue Gifts Rescue Gifts help refugees and others who have been impacted by war and natural disaster. Holiday shoppers can choose a gift that inspires them and dedicate it in honor of a special person in their lives. The IRC will send gift recipients a beautiful acknowledgement card with the gift giver's personalized message. There's a perfect gift for everyone. For a mom: A Safe Delivery ($24) can ensure critical supplies for the safe birth of a child in a crisis zone. For the foodie or friend with a green thumb: A Community Garden ($60) can provide tools and seeds to refugees who have been resettled in the United States, so that they can grow their own fresh, healthy food in an IRC community garden. For a teacher: A Year of School ($52) can supply the tuition, books and other materials for one year of a child's schooling in a country recovering from war.SlowColor SlowColor is a fair-trade company allowing weavers in India to work using traditional weaving techniques for a fair wage. Their scarves are soft, beautiful and made of non-toxic dyes. World Vision World Vision has an amazing gift catalog where you can buy a number of innovative and sustaining gifts for people living in poverty. Their website even allows you to purchase and print a card letting a loved one know you have donated in their name. You can purchase medical attention for a pregnant woman, a goat that can provide milk to a child -- even a grove of fruit trees! This is a small list of companies that are dedicated to making a difference through commerce. Know of more ways to gift things that give back? Leave a comment and share about the organization."

It's got B-vitamins for energy, vitamin A for immune functioning and vision, ""and there's no better iron-rich food."" That's good news for his clients -- more and more of whom are showing up exhausted by iron-deficiency anemia. The organ meat is so packed-to-the-hilt with the energy-producer that some* say it stands poised to replace Red Bull as the nightclub pick-me-up of choice. Put off by this organ meat's gamey taste? ""The liver gurus I've talked to recommend soaking it overnight in milk to break down some of the fibrous and protein tissues and take away that 'off' flavor,"" Grotto suggests. ""Maybe dredge it in cornmeal or flour and lightly pan-fry it, then pair it with grilled onions."" (Just don't go crazy, because liver is high in cholesterol.)Ok, let's be honest: No one is going to start eating liver, unless you're 80+ and have been consuming it since you were a young boy living in early 19th-century Eastern Europe.  Fortunately, you can still nab iron from spinach, edamame (soybeans), white beans, lentils and kidney beans. Or, as a last resort, swallow a multivitamin with up to 18mg of iron in it. I asked Grotto: What are some other, more mainstream must-eat foods that should be on everyone's shiny new grocery list for 2013?

People started speculating the baby's due date, its gender and possible names for the future King or Queen -- there was even a Twitter account created called ""RoyalFetus"" which is sending tweets ""from the womb"" (the account now has over 13,000 followers). Although this is an extremely exciting time to be a royal, it is an even better time to be an expectant mother. Think of all the maternity-wear inspiration. The Duchess of Cambridge is under constant watch, style watch that is. Over the past few years she has created what has come to be known as ""the Duchess Effect,"" whereby everything she wears becomes instantly coveted. Her penchant for wrap dresses, sleek coats and eleaborate hats has created legions of copycats around the globe, but what happens now that the ""queen"" of fashion is going to be sporting a baby bump? Thankfully, maternity clothes have made leaps and bounds in the last few years (being pregnant no longer means dowdy pants and oversized sweaters.) At this point we can merely speculate the luxe items that Kate will be wearing, but we are fairly confident Alexander McQueen maternity wear is just around the corner. The always demure and polished Duchess will certainly be receiving items from top designers, but the high-street fan will definitely benefit from the babe in Kate's belly. Click through the slideshow below for some of the styles we think the Duchess will be wearing while she's got a bun in the oven. Want more?

3,MONEY,2013 Living: Austerity With Double-Dip Frugality,"Marian Salzman, Contributor
CEO, Havas PR North America",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2013-living-austerity-frugality_us_5b9c9570e4b03a1dcc800afd,"Americans are deleveraging to reduce their debts to manageable levels. What will they do once they get debt to relatively manageable levels, predicted for around mid-2013?",2012-12-06,Pretty young business woman using mobile phone outdoor,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c95702500003600361fb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a world of seven billion people, it's hard to get a coherent picture of where things really stand on the economy. While millions of average consumers struggle to afford the rising cost of basic foods, millions more happily swallow the prices of the hot new offerings from Apple and Samsung. But there's no denying that for many people in mature consumer economies, life is a lot more troubled than it once was. Growing poverty has become a trend that shows every sign of continuing. More than 22 million American households comprising 47 million people are currently making use of food stamps. Tens of millions are out of work or fear losing their jobs. Many millions more are working for less than they used to; around 60 percent of new jobs in the United States are low-skill and low-wage. The number of Americans living in poverty equals 16 percent of the population.In the most troubled parts of Europe, austerity is biting deep; unemployment in Greece and Spain is 25 percent, way above the far-from-stellar 11.4 percent average of the euro currency area. In the UK, average incomes have fallen by near-record amounts.Even people who aren't struggling right now aren't necessarily sleeping easily. A 2012 survey found that 40 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, putting them one car repair or one medical bill away from financial catastrophe.As the economic crisis drags on, the shop-till-you-drop exuberance that drove the long boom has given way to caution. Even as consumer confidence is up in the weeks before the holidays, consumers in general are playing it safe, paying down what they owe; Americans are deleveraging to reduce their debts to manageable levels. What will they do once they get debt to relatively manageable levels, predicted for around mid-2013? The odds are against a return to consuming as we knew it before 2007-08. For one thing, it was fueled by debt; all that credit just won't be as cheap or readily available again. For another, people are finding different ways to get the things they need in life. The bad economy is spurring people to get creative.Frugal ConsumptionFor many people, big-ticket spending is out of style and not only because they don't have the money. In a break with previous demographic groups, the rising generation of millennials just isn't buying cars or big homes in sprawling suburbs where cars are essential; they want smaller places near transportation hubs and places where they can shop and eat out. Millennials aren't rejecting the comfort, convenience and other benefits of modern life. Along with many older people, they are just finding that they don't need to own something outright (apart from tech gadgets) to enjoy the benefits of it. It started with digital content: Why bother buying physical books, magazines, newspapers, CDs and DVDs that take up space if you can get them in virtual formats when you need them? Less clutter, less space needed, more mobility -- what's not to like? In fact, there's increasingly less of a need to own much of anything outright when there are so many new ways to use things only when you need them. It might look like old-style renting or leasing, but in its 21st-century form it's the sharing economy. People who want occasional use of a car without mainstream rental rates have the option of car-share services such as Zipcar. Membership grew 25 percent in 2011; at current rates, 4.4 million North Americans will belong to car-sharing services by 2016. Bikes have long been an ideal candidate for shared ownership; cities all over Europe have been doing it for years. Now the trend is catching on in the United States, with 29 systems going and a new scheme slated for 2013 in New York. GPS, wireless connections, airless tires and solar power are putting an efficient 21st-century spin on a 19th-century invention. If lavish consumption was about spending and buying things to feel good, frugal consumption is about feeling good by being smarter and spending less; it's about finding alternatives to the expense and wastefulness of old-style consumption. Why spend a lot to own something that's not going to get used much? It's a question being asked about everything from kids' clothes and fashion accessories to parking spots and industrial equipment. With each passing day, plenty of new answers are just a click away, as technology proves to be a powerful way of spreading ideas quickly and spawning new ones through sites such as Shareable.   This new consumption is not always about being too cash-strapped or cheap to buy outright. It's part of a new mentality and movement called Collaborative Consumption that harnesses interactive technology to match supply and demand for pretty much anything -- and create personal connections in the process. Collaborative Consumption evangelist Rachel Botsman says it's the dawning of a new type of economy where people's reputation for trustworthiness becomes more important than their creditworthiness. Another big plus is that it's sociable. Old consumption was about keeping up with the Joneses, says Botsman; collaborative consumption is about getting to know them. Even expensive college-level education is getting a frugal makeover, with top educational institutions offering high-quality courses online for free. It's not the same as strolling through the dappled shade of Harvard Yard or rubbing shoulders with Nobel laureates at Stanford, but it's unbeatable educational value for the price.This is the third in a series of 14 posts expanding on Salzman's forecasts for 2013 in her annual trends report, a program of global communications group Havas Worldwide. This year's book, What's Next? What to Expect in 2013, will be published on 12/12/12 and available at 120MBooks.com.

The annual cold, dark period is upon us.Through experience, we know that this is a time of year when we will be tested, both physically and emotionally. In turn, we will naturally come within and seek safety from the elements. It is a time where our activities, especially those around the holidays, tempt us to reach for our security blankets, whether that be the companionship of our friends, a warm beverage, or something similarly soothing. People also tend to eat and drink more. Sure, in the spirit of merriment, but for these other, more natural, reasons as well. It is here, as well, that we become energized by the promise of renewal. As a society, we anticipate the time just up ahead when we will be able to wipe the slate clean and start over, chalking up any missteps as lessons learned and water under the bridge.And while this cycle has its virtues, it can get impaired by the guilt we feel for allowing ourselves to indulge. Sometimes we forge through this time of year with our renewal dangling like a carrot just after the Jan. 1 finish line, shrugging off the hard feelings -- the feelings we experience but don't fully accept, let alone process. In this way, some of us can become consumed by shame, and the holiday period becomes painful, and the opportunity it presents lost. In and of itself, this is a shame. The question becomes how to enjoy the period most fully.I'd suggest using this time to get ourselves in shape across all spectrums, from satisfying both our physical and spiritual hunger to satiating the emotional hunger that rears its head when we neglect the former. And if things seem like they're already getting too hectic, think of the mounting intensity in which the coming weeks are characterized by, and then evaluate the current conditions again and your tendency to focus on one or the other. Again, the idea is balance. It appears that the key here is to attend to all our needs, in moderation. This means, of course, to eat and drink a little less than you might, but to pay attention to your emotional and spiritual needs a little more than you have. Now, it is critical, as we move through this short and powerful prologue, to ensure that we are feeling as good as we possibly can as the holidays unfold. If we can achieve this moderation and the elated feelings this balance produces, we will inevitably consume less, lifting the virtues of the season to their highest potential and getting through what remains of 2012 far more easily.  So as the next beautiful blanket of snow settles down to the earth, think of it as your security blanket, and take in its innocuous purity as a cue to literally cool off. Protect yourself from your own disdain, and open yourself up to a phase of the year which isn't normally characterized by clarity and balance, but certainly can be.For more by Dr. Michael Finkelstein, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
5,HOME & LIVING,Holiday Entertaining Ideas: Stress-Free Solutions For Small Spaces,"Ron Barth, Contributor
President, Resource Furniture",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/holiday-entertaining-ideas-stress-free_us_5b9c95b3e4b03a1dcc800eb0,Figuring out where to put everyone can be a buzz kill.,2012-12-06,Place setting for Christmas in white with white Christmas tree,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c95b3240000310053411e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This time of year, no matter what you are celebrating, entertaining is on everyone's mind. Time spent with friends and family, over night guests and those who drop by for a quick cocktail, and maybe even some hot-chocolate sipping little pals. While the company can be fun, figuring out where to put everyone -- and everything -- can be more stressful than Thanksgiving dinner at the in-laws. Luckily, we've compiled a list of the 5 must-have's for your holiday entertaining, and maybe even for hosting a few soirees throughout the year. Having a small space doesn't mean that you can't throw a big party -- so, cheers!1. If you have having guests that plan on staying and eating more than just a few quick bites, you'll need somewhere for them all to comfortably fit for the holiday feasts. Not the everyday dining table type? Not a problem. A small table that spends most of its days serving as a storage console is the perfect solution and pulls out to comfortably seat your guests. No dining room required!2. Open spaces always feel bigger, which are necessary when you have a quickly crowding room. Don't have an open loft with a view? Nothing gives the illusion of space better than reflective surfaces and good lighting. A large mirror and strategically placed lamps will help your home feel as cozy as it is, and dimmed lights help larger spaces feel more intimate. In a small space, you'll want to be sure your guests can comfortably and safely enjoy the evening by providing ample and well-integrated lighting. An interestingly-designed lamp that works as a conversation starter is never a bad idea.3. If your guests aren't coming for a 5-course meal, you can get away with not having a central table as long as there's plenty of seating for everyone. Normally dine solo? Chairs and ottomans that are easily stored away or serve another purpose for everyday life are the ideal solution. Folding chairs that stack and still look chic are a standard go-to or you can go the hidden route with the Cubista, which serves as an ottoman and conceals seating for five. If you are thinking ahead, you can go the pouf-as-a-coffee-table route during the year with a tray on top. This way, you have instant seating and a serving surface: multitasking at its best! Whatever you choose, make sure it can serve another purpose when not being used as seating, like a chair that doubles as a bookshelf -- again, useful AND a conversation piece.4. Are your guests more the overnight variety? For those of us without the spare bedroom awaiting out-of-town friends, who have perhaps outgrown a crash on the couch, you'll need a multi-tasking piece. A well-hidden bed with additional seating and maybe even some storage solves all your problems, except maybe assuring that your guests aren't too comfortable to extend their stay past New Year's. Again, thinking ahead and careful planning are key. Anticipate your lifestyle and what works for you - year round.5. Be flexible and creative! No matter how well-prepared a hostess you are, there will be some unexpected surprises and some shifting of items to prepare for a fete of any size. Having ample surfaces and storage room will assure that you can scoop those few things that prefer to remain well-hidden into a designated spot and avoid last minute scrambling. There are a multitude of options available whether you prefer a sleeker, more customizable option, a place for stacks of office papers or just need a place to store coats.The holidays are a great time for gathering with friends and reconnecting with family. Avoid the rush of the season by making your space work for you and planning ahead. Your guests will love you - and your home - and after it's all over you can sink into your seat with your own glass of bubbly and celebrate another year well done. Happy celebrating!Have something to say? Check out HuffPost Home on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram.**Do you have a home story idea or tip?

A recent study has linked frequent use of aspirin with a reduced risk of breast cancer in women.

Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania found that the coating on aspirin seems to delay the absorption of the drug by the body, thereby resulting in ""pseudoresistance"" to aspirin's effects. Coating is added to some aspirins to make it more stomach-friendly. Aspirin is often taken as a regular measure because it's been shown in past research to lower the risk of repeat heart attack.The findings ""question the value of coated, low-dose aspirin,"" study researcher Dr. Garret FitzGerald, M.D., director of the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, said in a statement. ""This product adds cost to treatment, without any clear benefit. Indeed, it may lead to the false diagnosis of aspirin resistance and the failure to provide patients with an effective therapy. Our results also call into question the value of using office tests to look for such resistance.""In the study, published in the journal Circulation and funded in part by Bayer Health Care, researchers had 400 study participants with an average age of 26 undergo blood and urine tests to see how many of them were resistant to aspirin. They took one dose of 325-milligram immediate release aspirin or enteric-coated aspirin. None of the study participants were found to have true resistance to aspirin, but some of them did have pseudoresistance to aspirin because of the coating. However, no one seemed resistant to aspirin if it didn't have the coating. ""Variable absorption caused a high frequency of apparent resistance to a single dose of 325 mg enteric coated aspirin (up to 49 percent) but not to immediate release aspirin (0 percent),"" researchers wrote in the study. FitzGerald told the Wall Street Journal that 90 percent of aspirin sold for heart-health reasons have coating.Bayer spokeswoman Anne Coiley said that the results of the study may not apply to the real world, though, ABC News reported.""The authors' suggestion that use of enteric coated aspirin should be questioned, based on these study results, is of concern given the study population and methodology used, neither of which reflect real-world clinical use,"" Coiley said in a statement obtained by ABC News.

NFL drug suspensions will hit a record this year, and at least some are felt to be related to amphetamine use, which is the main ingredient of Adderall, a drug that is also prescribed to children and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Some of the players claim they didn't realize that this mood-enhancing, performance-improving, potentially-addicting drug was on the banned list of substances for the league. That seems unlikely in that amphetamine has had an 80-year track record of legal and illegal use in our country. Like steroids, amphetamine is now banned in professional sports. Their use debases achievement founded upon hard work and practice. It also puts pressure on all the other non-using athletes to employ the drugs as well in order to stay competitive.The news story illuminates a growing problem for the NFL but also perpetuates two urban legends about Adderall and ADHD. Repeatedly, Adderall is described as a ""powerful stimulant"" for normal people but ""calms"" those with ADHD. In fact, amphetamine and its variants (like Ritalin and Concerta) act exactly the same in everyone, whether you ""have"" ADHD or not. Low doses of amphetamine will get anyone to stick with tasks they find boring or difficult. It also will make you more deliberate and methodical.Adderall's supposed ""calming"" effect on hyperactive children is simply these kids staying with things longer and acting less impulsively. As you increase the dose of amphetamine, children and adults with ADHD will become more verbal, overactive and eventually ""tweaked,"" just like a ""meth"" (methamphetamine) addict. The only difference between children and adults is that children regularly complain about higher dosages and many adults will report they ""feel powerful and grand"" on above therapeutic dosages of Adderall.The news report also suggests that as long as a doctor diagnoses ADHD in an athlete, then Adderall use becomes legitimate. The problem is that there are no biological or psychometric tests for ADHD. The disorder is a list of symptoms that anyone can learn to report to a doctor. Even if the doctor properly seeks independent confirmation from a spouse, school or employer, anyone striving in a position for which they are not well-suited by talent or temperament could potentially qualify for the diagnosis.Doctors used to say that if a child or adult responded to Adderall, then they must have ADHD. If that were the case then everyone could potentially have the disorder. Obviously, there are severe cases in children and adults that benefit from the drug. But attentional problems run a spectrum, from mild to severe, and in my opinion the vast majority of those receiving the ADHD diagnosis are of the mild variety (if they ""have"" it at all).The NFL problem with Adderall only highlights a much broader societal quandary over the use of performance-enhancing drugs. But the history of amphetamine use, prescribed or not, strongly suggests that a core group of adults using this drug will start to abuse and then become addicted to it. There have been waves of doctor-prescribed amphetamine abuse epidemics, which led to the Federal Drug Administration making amphetamine a controlled substance in 1972. Getting ahead is wired into the American psyche. America represents 4 percent of the world's population but produces 88 percent of the world's legal amphetamine (and a great deal of illegal methamphetamine and cocaine as well). Will Hill, a safety for the New York Giants who served a suspension this season for Adderall use, may have said it best: ""How do we decipher the fakers from not? When you try to get an advantage over the next person, that's why we get into these situations we're in."" Mr. Hill is right on, but he's not just speaking about the NFL; he's talking about the United States of Adderall.For more by Lawrence Diller, M.D., click here.For more on ADHD, click here."

Unemployment is also lower within the LGBT community. Only 7 percent of respondents reported to be out of a job, while the national average stands at 7.9 percent. When it comes to putting away money for the future, gay households save on average $6,000 more than the national average. Gay households also have $4,000 less in debt. The results are encouraging given the number of financial hurdles gay people face in today's political climate. The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which bans same-sex marriage from being recognized at a federal level, is one of the main factors that inhibits financial affluence among gay people. Despite the fact that gay marriage is legal in a number of states, under federal law gay married couples are prohibited from filing joint tax returns. A gay person is ineligible to collect a partner's full Social Security payment after he or she dies. Divorce also generally costs gay couples more.Financial constraints aside, gay people tend to be highly educated and live in more affluent areas of the country. According to the Prudential survey, 50 percent of respondents said they have at least a bachelor’s degree and almost 50 percent lived in big cities or big city suburbs. That said, only 14 percent of respondents indicated they feel well-prepared financially compared with 29 percent of the general population.On Nov. 5, Washington joined the ranks of six other states and the District of Columbia that have enacted laws or issued court rulings that permit same-sex marriage. LGBT residents in states that permit same-sex marriage were found to be more confident financially than those living in states with no legal relationship status, domestic partnerships or civil unions, according to Prudential.

The move was prompted by an increase in passenger complaints about others' rude behavior, which increased by a staggering 25 percent this year, reports the Telegraph. Gripes include spitting on and insulting ticket inspectors, putting feet on seats, pulling emergency alarms without reason, speaking loudly on mobile phones, playing music and damaging train interiors.""We aim to tackle offensive or irritating everyday behavior of people who make life a misery for other passengers,"" an SNCF spokesman told News.com.au.France also tried to spruce up Parisian commuter trains back in July by decorating a commuter train to look like the palace of Versailles. Hundreds of new employees (thousands by the Telegraph's account,) dubbed ""conflict specialists,"" will be brought in to patrol the system's trains, reports Daily Mail. The agents will be authorized to hand out fines for smoking, putting feet on seats or damaging property. In some cases they will also ""engage people in a conversation about simply having respect for their fellow passengers,' according to the paper. Perhaps the French really are fed up with their own incivility, as the Associated Press posited last summer. "
