0,DIVORCE,Should You Get Back With Your Ex?,"Marni Battista, Contributor
Founder, Dating With Dignity",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-you-get-back-with_us_5b9ca572e4b03a1dcc808837,Should you rekindle your relationship?,2012-12-26,A man sitting on a couch is having an argument with his girlfriend who has her head turned away,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca5722200005700d95201.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So you got divorced. Maybe someone cheated, or perhaps it was simply the wrong time, or maybe the courtship had hit a rut.   Should you rekindle your relationship? Well, since we aren't in your relationship, the truth is we really don't know. But what we do know is this: there are steps we can take to make this important decision the right one for you.   If you're in this position and wondering if you should get back together with your ex, there are few ways to make an informed choice about whether or not it's a good idea. Bottom line: there isn't always an obvious answer. You aren't weak, lame or mistaken if you decide to reconcile. And, giving him a second chance (or third, or fourth) can be the wrong choice. In an effort to help you make the choice for you and your specific situation, here are some general guidelines from the experts at DatingWithDignity.com.   Here are the times when you should not get back with your ex. 1. You're ignoring a siren that's going off in your head (and your heart) that's flashing a clear message: ""Getting back together is a mistake."" When the little voice inside (we call it intuition) screams to be brave and break up, it's a good indication to trust your judgment. If you're mostly afraid to do it because of fear that you will be alone, rather than because there's the possibility of your ex changing some behaviors, then know that fear is not a reason to stay together.2. Your partner was a repeat offender of one of your non-negotiables in your relationship, such as not supporting you in your choices or not respecting your opinions. Also, any repeated patterns of cheating, emotional and physical abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, etc., that aren't being addressed by a professional should not be ignored. Hoping he will get it together is merely your denial. Break up.3. You're acting out of desperation because you feel like you're too old, never meet any nice guys, don't have confidence you will meet someone better, etc. Again, if fear vs. love is motivating you to separate, it's time to dig deep and look at how you can start to fall in love with yourself.4. You just really miss having a warm body next to you.  Should you truly be feeling like you might be ready to get back with your ex, you need to take the following steps to make an informed choice about whether or not you should go full steam ahead or proceed with caution:   1. Address the reasons why it wasn't working in the first place and why you think it might work now.  Did you break up because it was bad timing? Maybe one of you just received a huge promotion or you had just lost a job and focus on the relationship was waning. Was one of you experiencing some family trauma that you couldn't take your mind off of? Or was it something like the fact they you both had completely different opinions about marriage or your perception of the world?   In the event that it was the latter, think long and hard about if you can be in a relationship with a person who has values that are diametrically opposed to your own. If it was more a timing issue, then it's absolutely a subject that should be broached -- and you can feel free to open the communication lines.   Finally, is your partner open to getting counseling or coaching to resolve the matter systemically? In this case, band-aid fixes and promises to ""be better"" in general won't cut it. However, working on your relationship with the aid of a professional can truly help you rediscover the love that brought you together in the first place.   2. Don't involve everyone and her mother in your decision making process.  Don't get all your friends together for a night of drinks to have everyone contribute their opinion about whether you and Mr. Ex should get back together. But do take time alone (at least one night alone and hopefully a conversation with a trained professional coach or therapist) where you can think and isolate your own opinions.   If you have one trusted friend who's usually pretty spot on with her advice, confide in her. Tell her what you're thinking and get her feedback. Make sure to have clarity and definitely make sure to be honest with yourself.   The only person who can make this decision is you. But don't forge ahead without taking a step back to get to the heart of the matter."

Six funeral services were held Thursday in the Newtown area for students and teachers slain in the attack. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca871240000310094c4a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In light of the tragedy at Sandy Hook, I dropped my children off at school with a heavy heart this past week. Seeing a policeman at the door each morning has been comforting. Knowing why he's there is not. I know I speak for many when I say that every news report, every photo of a lost child, every shattered family member talking about simple pleasures the victims loved -- painting, Legos, pretty dresses, time with siblings -- is like a wound that gets ripped open again and again.I have cried so much this past week -- and not just any cry, either. It's a soul cry. The kind that comes in waves and without warning. The kind you can feel in your gut -- and the kind that makes you skip out on Christmas parties because nothing feels particularly merry or bright. But in being mindful of my own pain I've also been watching others in theirs and I've seen a few patterns emerge. I've seen those, like my husband, who avoid it altogether. As I sit in vigil over the TV, he won't even glance at the screen. I don't blame him. Everyone grieves differently and looking evil in the eye is hard, draining work. Still, I believe all pain exists to teach us something we didn't know before. If you can't acknowledge it, you can't learn from it. I also see those who are afraid. These are the folks who launch into highly-emotional reactions over guns, mental health and the stripping away of ""freedom"" in this country. They are trolling social media in particular and, if you don't guard your mind, you can get hooked into their darkness and start to dwell there with them. (You'll know you've reached this point by the way when you also find yourself wanting to bury your head or throw up your hands because ""it's too hard, too late or too hopeless."") Thankfully, I've also seen another tribe emerging. These are the ones searching for ways to create meaning out of what happened. They are the light workers because their thoughtfulness literally brings light to the lives of others. They are candles sparking other candles -- and it's not only a beautiful thing to watch, it's a beautiful way to honor the fallen. If you want to join this tribe but don't know where to start, I have a simple solution. Start where you are. Start with your own thoughts and when you find them getting pulled into the minutia of rage, fear, or judgment, just remember the old saying that ""whatever you feed grows."" In other words, the more you think about fear, the more fearful you will become. The more you think about hate, the more hateful you will become. Fortunately for us, the inverse is also true. The more you think about caring, the more caring you will become, the more you think about joy, the more joyful you will become, and so on. Personally, I'm paying tribute to Sandy Hook this season by accepting the challenge to generate 26 acts of kindness -- one for each victim at the school -- or 28 acts if you want to include the killer and his mom. Up to you. Here's the start of my list. 1. Delivered two bags of food to a holiday drive.  2. Donated to Make-a-Wish.  3. Bought some Christmas gifts from a Haitian nonprofit that puts 100 earthquake survivors to work.  4. Volunteered yesterday to meet with someone who is going through a career crisis and needed an ear.  4. Brought a jar of homemade strawberry jam to my kids' teachers and the crossing guard who protects them from other cars.  6. Gave a box of sweet potatoes to a friend. As I make my way through these small, simple acts, I keep thinking of an interview I heard recently with Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. He talked of being at Auschwitz with his father where one night ""dinner"" was only a tiny piece of bread between the two of them. Wiesel's father, clearly weak and starving, told his son he wasn't hungry and gave him the bread. This one act of kindness, given amid such death and despair, showed Wiesel there was still good in the world and changed the course of his life forever. And when I'm tempted to think my small acts don't matter or our collective candles aren't burning bright enough, I remember Wiesel's words which seem as true for our experience today as they were for his almost seventy years ago: I belong to a generation that has often felt abandoned by God and betrayed by mankind and yet I believe that we must not give up on either. We must choose between the violence of adults and the smiles of children. Between the ugliness of hate and the will to oppose it. Between inflicting suffering and humiliation on our fellow man and offering him the solidarity and hope he deserves. I know I speak from experience that even in darkness it is possible to create light and encourage compassion. There it is. I still believe in man, in spite of man.Me too."
2,PARENTING,Dog Talk,"Andrea Wachter, Contributor
Psychotherapist and Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/self-esteem_us_5b9ca8f2e4b03a1dcc80a373,"Helping my clients learn to accept who they are -- and who they aren't -- is essential, and it is so liberating for them when they finally do.",2012-12-26,"Description Golden Retriever dog (canis lupus familiaris), resting Un ... of dogs Category:Front views of dogs Category:Golden Retriever puppies ... ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca8f22500003200362821.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a therapist who loves working with young girls, I see so many who struggle with all of the typical issues that adolescents face: low self- worth, body image issues and friendship insecurities, just to name a few. I try to be creative and speak in ways they can relate to, and frankly, terms like ""self-love"" and ""self-acceptance"" just don't always seem to cut it. So that's how I started ""dog talk."" When I ask my young clients if they have or love a dog, most of the time, their faces light up. I mean, who doesn't love a dog? Aside from the occasional person who has been bitten and may prefer cats, I find that it is easy for my clients to relate to dog talk.Ask almost any young girl how she would speak to her dog if it were hurt. How would she treat it if it were tired or hungry? ""If your dog was whining for food, would you ever in a million years think of depriving it or making it go hungry?"" I ask them. ""If your dog had a roll on her tummy would you judge or hate her? If another dog snarled at her, would you think your dog was unworthy or unlovable?"" ""Of course not,"" they respond, horrified to even imagine such a thing. Their answers are no surprise. It is much easier for young girls to access their heart, their compassion and their common sense when it comes to an animal they love, and I find it can frequently be transferred to the way they view themselves. I often ask girls to conjure the feeling they have inside when they think of their dog. I ask them to notice how loving they feel and then to imagine seeing themselves that way. It might not always take at first, but with some practice, they can access feelings that are usually reserved for their beloved pet.I also teach my clients about what I refer to as, ""dog breed theory."" So many of the young girls I see think they should look or be like someone else. If only they looked like Olivia, or had a body like Rebecca, or played sports like Chloe or were more outgoing like Jasmine. I explain to them that we are all different breeds. Just like there are shy Chihuahuas, tough bulldogs and outgoing labs, we are all supposed to be different from one another. (I know I am generalizing here to make a point. There are tough little Chihuahuas and soft, sweet bulldogs but bear with me if you will!) My point is, we need shy people and we need outgoing people and it all balances out in the end. And we all need different things, being the breeds that we are. Being a sensitive, hide-under-the-bed breed myself, I always found that I took things much more to heart than my tougher-skinned siblings. (And heaven help the trembling puppies with siblings of the growling variety!) It took me a long time to learn that there are no ""good"" or ""bad"" breeds. We all simply need different things. As a youngster (prior to knowing my breed theory!), when someone called me ""too sensitive,"" I often walked away in shame (dare I say with my tail between my legs!) But as I got older and more accepting of my breed, when someone commented on my sensitivity, I merely agreed and went on with my day. Helping my clients learn to accept who they are -- and who they aren't -- is essential, and it is so liberating for them when they finally do.I also use dog talk to help young girls navigate the ever-so-painful process of ""friend-shifts."" You know, best friends with Julie for four years and now she won't even speak to her? Grew up and played sports with Madison since second grade and now she's hanging with a bad crowd? Hard not to take it personally, I know. I think we all know. But when I talk to them about walking their dog and noticing how their pet ignores some dogs, stops to sniff others and might even attack another, this has no bearing on whether any of the dogs are worthy or lovable. We simply have chemistry and connection or we don't, and it is not personal. So, lets teach our kids to love themselves as much, or even half as much as they love their dogs. (Cats if they are cat lovers!)Let's remind them that we are all supposed to be different. We are all meant to be different breeds.And let's help our girls to see friendships as friend-shifts that are ever changing and nothing personal. Easier said than done? You bet. But we can find a way in, to help our girls be kinder to themselves, and what better way than dog talk.Andrea Wachter, LMFT is co-founder of InnerSolutions Counseling Services and co-author of The Don't Diet, Live-It Workbook.

Why? Because I was born on December 26. But I realize that others might have it worse.",2012-12-26,"Young girl helping her mother decorating the Christmas tree, holding some Christmas baubles in her hand (Focus on bauble)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad114a250000cf00376114.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a kid, my birthday parties weren't always well-attended and two years ago, I celebrated my birthday almost two months late. Why? Because I was born on December 26, and while I did write a song called ""Jesus Steals My Thunder,"" I realize that others might have it worse. So I asked Tony and Emmy award-winning actress Bebe Neuwirth (12/31), comedian and radio host Brian Babylon (12/23), writer/producer Larry Goldstein (12/24) and the man who refers to himself as Baby Jesus' understudy, choreographer John Paolillo (12/25) how they feel about being born at this time of year. In the spirit of fairness, I've listed their responses in order from who gets shafted the most to the least (Larry said New Year's Eve was worse than Christmas Eve, so Bebe's second).Do you have any funny stories about your birthday? John: My Mom told me that when Santa was going up the chimney, I fell out of his bag of toys, and I was wrapped up in a blanket on a braided rug in front of the fireplace. A year or two later, I thought, ""We don't have a fireplace, and we have wall-to-wall carpet."" So I approached her and she told me she would tell me the truth. She said on Christmas morning in this empty field next to us there was a huge hill, and this big snowball came rolling down. And she heard crying in this big snowball, and when they broke it open, I was inside. I thought that was the truth for a long time and when I got older, I realized that I would have been frostbitten, and that I probably would have lost limbs or something.Bebe: I was two weeks late, and it was coming up to the end of the year. A week before I was born, my father took my mother out in a beat up old Volvo and drove her over the railroad tracks because he wanted to induce labor. The year was almost up, and he wanted to make sure I could be a tax deduction, so he could claim two dependents, and it worked.Larry: I was due on Christmas Day, but the doctor didn't want to work, so he induced my Mom on Christmas Eve. Also, there was a Dear Abby column where a parent wrote in about combo gifts, and Dear Abby's response was, ""Is it worth a lifetime of disappointing memories for a child just to save a few dollars on a combo gift?"" I was seven and cut it out of the paper and every year in early December, that clipping would mysteriously appear on the fridge.Brian: I had corporate parents, so I had to plead my case for gifts with a cost/benefit analysis. I was like a lobbyist. I had to break down the cost of each gift and how many times I'd use it to get the most value out of it. The first acronym I learned was ROI.What's the worst thing about being born on (near) Christmas/New Year's? John: The fact that you have to share the day with Baby Jesus and Santa. Jesus gets first billing. Then, Santa. Then, me. It's kind of like Diana Ross and the Supremes. I'm one of the Supremes.Bebe: I think the worst thing is having people count down to the end of the day. The only day of the year when people recognize that midnight is the end of the day is on my birthday. You feel like you get a little bit abbreviated. I feel compelled sometimes to wake up really early to make sure I get as many hours of birthday time as I can. Larry: As a kid, I didn't mind it really, but a lot of people weren't around for my birthday, so I couldn't have a party. As an adult, I never got the cookie cake in the conference room. Brian: I never had any worst thing.What's the best thing about being born on (near) Christmas/New Year's? John: My mother told me that it's special, so I believed that because I was born on Christmas I was special. Bebe: I love that my dad's birthday is two days before mine because I love my father, and I like that there's a good chance that it will snow on my birthday. Larry: I've never had to work on my birthday. Brian: It's an extra chance to do resolutions and self-evaluation. It's like your own personal New Year's Eve. You can do a whole other reboot. Also, when I was younger, I was happy to be born on the 23rd because it was Michael Jordan's number.Here's my two cents on being born on December 26.Do most people forget your birthday? John: Yes, unless they see it on Facebook, then I'll get birthday wishes. I get birthday wishes from my immediate family and close childhood friends because I've threatened the people closer to me.Bebe: Most people remember my birthday. It's the perk of being born on a holiday or quasi-holiday.Larry: Yes.Brian: No, my mom's birthday is on the same day as mine, so it's hard to forget it in my house. Facebook helps, too.Have you ever received a birthday gift that's wrapped in holiday paper? John: Yes, so I like to find out when their birthday is and give them a birthday/Christmas gift with seasonal wrapping paper. If they're born in the summer, it's a little bit of a payback for me. It's just a quiet f*#k you.Bebe: Yes, you feel bad. You feel like ""Well, it's lovely you gave me a present. You didn't have to do that."" Then, it feels like it was an afterthought, so I feel bad about feeling bad about it. It's very nice when people want to give you a present, but it's very passive-aggressive to say, ""Oh, I just had some extra paper lying around.""Larry: Of course. I'm guilty of doing that myself. I've wrapped Hanukkah gifts for others in Christmas paper. It's a holiday. It counts. Brian: All the time. That's how I expect gifts to be wrapped for me. My grandmother was notorious for doing that.Have you ever received a combo gift or combo card and if so, how did you feel about that? John: When I was a teen, a friend gave me two boxes. One wrapped in Christmas paper and one in birthday paper. There was a glove in one box, and a glove in the other. Then, he put half a scarf in one and half a scarf in the other. He got a good laugh out of it. I used the scarf to choke him.Bebe: I don't remember anything specific, but I do remember very serious conversations with my husband when we were first getting to know each other. I explained very, very seriously that those are two distinctly different events. My husband is so wonderful and sensitive and very, very good about making celebrations for me or anybody, so this was not a hassle.Larry: I didn't get a lot of combo gifts except from distant relatives sometimes. Brian: Yeah, but people are trying to save time, so I don't feel slighted.How do you usually celebrate your birthday? John: On Christmas morning, half of the gifts under the tree were wrapped in Christmas paper and the other half had birthday wrapping paper and bows. My mother did this until I was probably in my 30s, and I liked it because they acknowledged that it was my birthday. I never knew what it was like to have a birthday party because every time we tried, the kids couldn't come because parents were out Christmas shopping. The first big real party I had was for my 50th birthday. It was the first time everyone was at an event for me with my name on the cake, and it was a roast/birthday. I think probably because it was my 50th and I never had a birthday party, everyone was like, that's the party we must go to.Bebe: I usually have a really quiet dinner with my husband and stay in. It's tricky to get dinner reservations on New Year's Eve if we want to go out for a nice dinner because sometimes it's a set menu or there are two seatings. One at 6:00, and one at 9:00. Fortunately, my husband's an excellent cook, so that's always an option.Larry: It's a tough day because you can't do much. The only thing that's open are Chinese restaurants and adult shops. Brian: The 23rd is hard because it's usually the last day of work for most people. I never really had birthday parties unless I planned it as a holiday party. If you can find another late December birthday partner to go in on pushing the whole birthday thing, then you can double the action, and it makes it much more fun.Do you have any tips for people thinking about conceiving in March? John: Be considerate and be aware that your child could be born on Christmas and you could be cheating them and scarring them for life. Bebe: (laughs) Use protection. Larry: I like having my birthday when it is. I like the holidays. I love the lights and having your birthday in the middle of that makes it that much more special. I would not want to have a New Year's Eve birthday because everyone is partying, but not for you.Brian: Do what you want to do. You can still celebrate whenever you want, and it's easier to show them you care in 2012 than it was in the '70s or '80s. You couldn't email or text back then.Do you have any advice for people who are expecting a child around Christmas or New Year's? John: To lessen the blow for the child when they learn that they have competition, tell them they were born in a snowball or fell out of Santa's bag.Bebe: Your birthday is your birthday and your chosen holiday is your chosen holiday and ne'er the twain shall meet. Keep 'em separate. Larry: Remember what Dear Abby said.Brian: Teach your kid PowerPoint and have them present their case to you like an expert. I think that really made me a good communicator - to articulate what you want, why you want it and put money behind it.So there are a few opinions on the matter. Bottom line: don't overlook anyone born during this time of year and happy birthday to all of those holiday-adjacent babies!"

The typically tomboyish royal stunned in a cream-colored jacket, a brown fascinator and lace-up heeled booties -- much trendier than expected. Princess Eugenie also impressed in stylish knee-high boots.There were, of course, three notable absences: Prince Harry is still off serving in Afghanistan, and Prince William and Kate are celebrating Christmas with the Middletons in the southern England village of Bucklebury, breaking with tradition. Rumor has it that with a baby on the way, the Duchess of Cambridge wished to spend her last Christmas sans children (i.e. her last relaxing Christmas for a good 18 years at least) with her own family. ""The Middletons' Christmas should be blissfully calm. We're good at keeping each other's spirits up,"" her sister Pippa wrote in recent article for Spectator, a weekly British mag. Kate could use it, seeing as she's been fighting hyperemesis gravidarum since getting pregnant several months ago. Indeed, one blog noted that Kate looked rather pale and exhausted when walking to church with William and her family this morning.Of course her clothing was anything but: the duchess donned her sleek Hobbs coat, Aquatalia by Marvin K suede booties, a Gucci clutch and a jaunty red scarf.Check out photos of the whole family minus our favorites celebrating Christmas in style.Want more?

Through the end of December, spectators can marvel at the Colorado Blue Spruce's 450 strings of LED lights and 120 star ornaments (all of which were engineered by General Electric). After catching sight of the magnificent tree, peruse the ""Pathway of Peace"" -- a series of 56 miniature trees decorated with ornaments from America's states, territories, and the District of Columbia. By the way, if you missed the lighting ceremony, you can watch it online here.Zürich, Switzerland Height: 50 FeetFrom the ""Lucy"" lights (12,000 white, red, and blue LED lights that glimmer along the Bahnhofstrasse shopping avenue) to the cheery Christmas markets, Zürich sparkles at Christmastime. But nothing gleams brighter than its 50-foot Christmas tree. With typical Swiss elegance, the spruce tree -- which was chopped down from the nearby Uetliberg Mountain -- glitters with more than 7,000 Swarovski crystal ornaments. You'll find the glorious tree perched inside the Zürich Hauptbahnoff Railway Station, which also plays host to Europe's largest indoor Christmas market. Here, you'll find 150 stalls selling tantalizing Swiss snacks and hand-crafted holiday gifts.London Height: 65.6 FeetEvery year since 1947, the people of Oslo have gifted London with an awe-inspiring Christmas tree. This annual present symbolizes Norway's thankfulness to Great Britain for its support during World War II, and for many Londoners, the annual tree lighting kicks off the holiday season. Hundreds of lights are strung in typical Norwegian fashion (vertically draping from top to bottom) in a simple, but visually pleasing display. You'll find the statuesque Norwegian spruce rising majestically from London's Trafalgar Square, surrounded by the National Gallery and Nelson's Column, among other London landmarks.Sydney Height: 69 FeetIn a holiday tradition that stems back to 1937, Sydneysiders showcase their Christmas spirit with bright, twinkling lights at Martin Place. The source of the city's illumination is an enormous Christmas tree that rises 69 feet into the air and is speckled with a whopping 59,000 lights. To cap off the fluorescently-lit fir, a five-foot star is placed on top. The annual tree lighting is met with much fanfare -- concerts, dancing, fireworks and more. This Aussie city opts for brilliant multi-colored ornaments rather than the classic crystal other cities like Zürich or Paris display.Paris Height: 70 FeetChristmastime is one of the busiest times of the year, so if you want to knock two things off your to-do list at once -- marveling at a spectacularly decorated tree and holiday gift shopping -- head to the Galeries Lafayette department store along Boulevard Haussmann in central Paris. One of the city's most elegant trees hangs inside the gorgeous Belle Époque building: The 70-foot stunner sits suspended in the air like a chandelier and is ornamented with a colorful array of small and large Swarovski crystals. The sumptuous tree shines brightly against the backdrop of 10 stories of high-end luxury stores.Prague, Czech Republic Height: 72 FeetStroll through Prague's Old Town Square in December, and you'll be transported to a winter wonderland. Not only will you find a bustling open-air Christmas market, but there's also a nearby ice-skating rink and a Christmas Eve midnight mass. But what steals the spotlight here is the square's centerpiece, a staggering 72-foot-tall Christmas tree. This festive spruce is adorned with 36,000 lights and100 huge ornaments shaped like gingerbread men. We recommend finding a seat at one of the surrounding cafés or bars to revel in the evergreen's beauty while sipping a hot coffee or a hearty brew.New York City Height: 80 FeetIn her now-famous ode to New York, musician Alicia Keys croons that ""these streets will make you feel brand new; big lights will inspire you."" And that lyric seems to ring true, especially at Rockefeller Center during the holiday season. For 80 years, the Big Apple has ushered in the Christmas spirit by decorating a ceremoniously large tree. This year, you'll find an enormous 80-foot-tall Norway Spruce decked with a glittering Swarovski crystal star. And in case you're wondering, the 45,000 lights twinkling from the tree's branches are energy-efficient LEDs. But even though New York is the city that never sleeps, you'll need to visit the tree before 11:30 p.m. to see it in all its glory. (The lights turn on at 5:30 a.m. and are switched off at 11:30 p.m., until Christmas Day when they'll shine for 24 hours.)Vilnius, Lithuania Height: 82 FeetCome Christmastime, the lights from Vilnius' five-story Christmas tree set the city aglow. And yet, Lithuania's capital city is proud to note that the electricity output for all that Christmas cheer is just 2.8 kilowatts, equal to that expended by an ordinary vacuum cleaner. You'll find the tree -- decorated with brightly lit snowflake ornaments -- in Cathedral Square through the end of December. You'll also notice that the tree is perfectly shaped. Why? Because underneath all of those branches stands an 82-foot-tall cone frame.Phoenix, Ariz. Height: 110 FeetThis might surprise you, but a Christmas tree at an outlet mall in Phoenix, Ariz. holds the title as tallest fresh-cut tree in America. To give you a reference point, this mammoth evergreen surpasses Rockefeller Center's iconic Christmas tree by 30 feet. This 110-foot-tall white fir tree towers over Dress Barn and Yogurberry and the many other stores in the Outlets at Anthem mall. It's garnished with 120 strings of LED lights, oversize ornaments and a three-foot-tall copper star. And in case you're feeling sad that the Earth has lost one more gorgeous pine tree, take heart that 12 were planted in this one's stead.Dortmund, Germany Height: 147.6 FeetIf you find yourself in Dortmund this December, you'll likely see the flickering lights of its enormous Christmas trees before you notice anything else about the eighth largest city in Germany. Yes, that's right: trees. The 148-foot-tall spectacle is actually the sum total of 1,700 individual red spruce trees, stuffed and stacked into a frame. Tens of thousands of lights, as well as 20 candles, create a glowing wintry scene, which you can enjoy in the Hansaplatz (market square). While admiring Dortmund's Christmas spirit, you can also partake in some holiday shopping. Hansaplatz also serves as the location of a bustling Christmas market encompassing more than 300 stalls, selling yuletide treats, and handcrafted gifts.In Pictures: World's Tallest Christmas Trees"

Of course the point of economic policy is to produce an economy that improves the lives of the people in a sustainable way. Clinton badly flunked this test.The Clinton economy was driven by a stock bubble. This is not a debatable point. The ratio of market-wide stock prices to corporate earnings was well over 30 to 1 at the peak of the bubble in 2000. This is more than twice the historic average.This run-up in stock prices drove the economy in two ways. First, since any good huckster could make millions selling shares in dot.whatever, we had many hucksters starting nutball businesses that never had a prayer of making a profit. This is not much of a long-run economic strategy, but in the short-term it led to an increase in investment.The other way that the bubble drove the economy is through the wealth effect on consumption. The run-up in stock prices generated roughly $10 trillion in bubble wealth. The wealth effect from stock is usually estimated to be 3-4 cents on the dollar. This would mean that the bubble generated between $300 billion to $400 billion annually in additional consumption. This would have been 3-4 percent of GDP at the time ($480 billion to $560 billion annually in today's economy). This is born out in the Commerce Department's data which show that the saving rate fell from close to 7 percent at the start of the 1990s to around 2.0 percent at the peak of the bubble in 2000. This was the economy that President Clinton handed to President Bush in January of 2001. It was an economy that was being carried by an unsustainable bubble that, in fact, already was in the process of deflating at the time Bush took office. The S&P 500 was more than 10 percent below its 2000 peak and the NASDAQ was down by more than 40 percent on the day that Bush took office. This pretty much guaranteed the recession that began in March of 2001 just as the collapse of the housing bubble placed President Obama in the middle of terrible recession in January of 2009.The 2001 recession was the main reason that the surplus vanished in the 2002 fiscal year. Directing tax cuts to the wealthy was a foolish policy response to the downturn, but it was reasonable to turn to fiscal stimulus following the collapse of the stock bubble, just as it was reasonable for President Obama to turn to fiscal stimulus following the collapse of the housing bubble. The Bush tax cuts did provide a boost to the economy, although they would have provided a larger boost if this money had been directed at moderate and middle income people or devoted to long-term investments like education and infrastructure.  The growth of the housing bubble eventually provided the boost needed to recover from the 2001 recession, just as the stock bubble propelled growth in the 1990s. As the economy got back near full employment in 2006 and 2007, the deficits shrank to sustainable levels. However, while the deficits were sustainable in the later years of the Bush presidency, the housing bubble was not. Its collapse gave us the most predictable economic disaster in human history, even if all our top economists somehow didn't see it. To have a sustainable growth path we have to reverse one of the other central policies of the Clinton years, the over-valued dollar. This policy, which was put in place when Robert Rubin became Treasury Secretary, ensured that we would have large trade deficits. The trade deficits were good news for Wall Street with its obsession over inflation. It was also good news for companies looking to move operations overseas to take advantage of cheap labor. However, the high dollar was terrible news for the country's workers, who were placed at an enormous competitive disadvantage. It resulted in the loss of more than 4 million manufacturing jobs. It was also bad news for anyone who doesn't think that bubbles are a clever way to drive the economy.Rubin and his allies control the Democratic Party with their money at the moment. Their financial power will not be easily overcome. However, it is important that people understand that the Rubin-Clinton team is every bit as much about redistributing money from the rest of us to the very rich as the Republicans. The big difference is that, unlike the Republicans, the Rubin-Clinton crew believes that the rich should have to pay their taxes. That's something, but until there is someone in this debate who isn't pushing policies that redistribute before-tax income upward, the vast majority in this country can only lose."

Krugman was given the prestigious award, which includes a prize of $1.4 million for his work on economic trade theory. (Photo by Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e1c21f0000df0023b208.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Krugman is doubling down in his battle with deficit hawks. The Nobel Prize-winning economist struck back at those who doubted his rationale for not being concerned about the budget deficit in a blog post Monday afternoon. Krugman described in a column in The New York Times that morning how The Wall Street Journal, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others predicted that fears over rising U.S. government debt would spook investors. In reality, he noted, interest rates on U.S. government debt are at historic lows, indicating that investors aren’t worried about America’s ability to pay off its debt.Still, Krugman wrote in his blog post that he received “remarkably foolish” feedback on his column as deficit hawks continued to doubt that low interest rates prove investors aren’t concerned about America’s debt. “The persistence of the inflationista, eek! deficits! view despite year after year of failure -- and the amazing effort put into making excuses for year after year of failure -- are a wonder to behold,” Krugman wrote in the blog post. Deficit reduction has become a major point of contention as Congress and President Obama scramble to reach a budget deal before the end of the year to avoid the “fiscal cliff” of tax increases and spending cuts, which some economists say could plunge the economy into recession. Republicans have insisted on a deal that includes major spending cuts and minimal tax increases on the rich to reduce the deficit, while Obama is seeking to raise taxes on Americans making more than $250,000 to narrow the budget gap. The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein argued in a blog post Monday that Republicans’ resistance to tax increases is actually an indication that they aren’t as concerned about deficit reduction as they seem. Instead, their actual goal is to reduce the size of government, Klein wrote.“For Republicans, agreeing to those tax increases means agreeing to a larger government than would be possible in the absence of those tax increases,” Klein wrote. “That undermines their real goal: Not smaller deficits, but smaller government.”"
